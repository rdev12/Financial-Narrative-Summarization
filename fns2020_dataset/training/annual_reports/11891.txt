Chairman’s  
Statement
Strong foundations &     global reach
During 2009 Patsystems demonstrated 
the inherent strength of its business 
model despite it being a tough year 
for the global financial business 
community. The robustness of the 
Patsystems revenue model, the spread 
of revenue across a breadth of 
complimentary product offerings and 
the exposure to opportunities across 
the globe meant Patsystems’ business 
was resilient during a difficult market 
period. With turnover growth of 13% 
and adjusted profit growth of 7% the 
business has performed well during 
2009 and is well placed for further 
growth in 2010. I am particularly 
pleased by the increase in turnover  
of our Asia Pacific business of 47%  
to £7.6 million.
Cash	flows	fr om	operating	activities	
amounted	to	£4.3	million	compar ed	to	
£3.6	million	in	2008,	an	incr ease	of	21%	
and	we	expect	this	level	of	cash	
generation	to	continue	in	the	forthcoming	
year .	The	year	end	cash	balance	stood	at	
£8.9	million	(2008:	£5.9	million)	and	the	
business	r emains	debt	fr ee.

appointment	as	Head	of	North	America		
in	October	2009,	r eplacing	Patrick	Kenny

Future
In	2010	Patsystems	is	expecting	that	the	
sales	focus	in	the	USA	and	Eur ope	will	be	
on	the	implementation	of	risk	systems	and	
the	pr ovision	of	hosted	services.
In	the	Asian	and	emerging	market	ar eas	
our	focus	will	be	on	trading	system

Business Review
Chief Executive’ s  
Report 
The sales opportunities that had been 
progressing during the closing  
months of 2008 were converted into 
contracted sales in 2009. I am 
particularly delighted by the exchange 
system sales to the Indonesian 
Commodity and Derivatives Exchange 
and also the Turkish Derivatives 
Exchange, the first trading system 
sales in Brazil, Malaysia and Korea  
and the risk system sales to JP Morgan 
and Prudential Bache.
W e	have	seen	sales	success	for	all	of	our	
pr oduct	of ferings,	and	in	many	cases	the	
sales	success	has	been	for	a	combination	
of	our	pr oducts	to	deliver	an	end-to-end	
solution	to	support	our	customers’	
business	gr owth	plans.
Trading Systems and Market 
Connectivity
The	trading	systems	business	deliver ed	8%	
gr owth	in	r evenues	over	2008	and	was	
the	most	successful	year	to	date	with	
annual	sales	of	£17.6	million.	This	success	
was	despite	the	collapse	of	Lehman	
Br others	Inc	and	the	r esulting	loss	of	£0.8	
million	r evenue	contribution	that	we	
would	have	expected	fr om	this	customer	
in	2009.
During	the	year	new	and	existing	
customers	installed	trading	systems	in	
Brazil,	Kor ea,	Malaysia,	Singapor e	and	
T okyo.
One	of	Patsystems’	key	dif fer entiators	
fr om	our	competitors	is	the	br eadth	of	
market	connectivity	we	of fer .	In	2009	
BM&F	(Brazil),	Bursa	Malaysia,	EDX	
(London),	SAFEX	(South	Africa),	SICOM	
(Singapor e),	SMX	(Singapor e)	and	T aiwan	
Futur es	Exchange	wer e	all	added	as	
market	connections.
Patsystems’	trading	system	continues	to	
dif fer entiate	itself	in	the	market	place	in	
thr ee	key	ar eas:
The	ability	to	distribute	the	J-T rader	 •	
trading	 scr een	 pr oduct	 easily	 and	 at	 low	
cost	acr oss	the	inter net;
The	capability	of	Patsystems’	published	 •	
connection	pr otocol	which	means	that	
thir d	 parties	 can	 write	 to	 the	 Patsystems	
trading	system	once,	but	be	connected	
to	all	of	our	available	market	
connectivity;
The	depth	of	functionality	within	the	 •	
Pr o-Mark	pr ofessional	trading	tool		
and	its	market	leading	spr eading	
functionality .
Pr o-Mark	has	continued	its	successful	
gr owth	in	2009	with	the	number	of	
billable	users	rising	fr om	571	at	the		
start	of	the	year	to	723	at	the	end	of	
December	2009.
Our	r eplacement	or der	management	
system,	Global	T rading,	has	been	subject	
to	extensive	validation	in	2009	with		
its	performance	and	capabilities	tested	
extensively	acr oss	our	full	range	of	
exchanges,	pr oducts	and	volumes.		
The	pr oduct	has	been	deliver ed	into	a	
customer	for	testing	and	will	be	deployed

Exchange Systems
2009	has	seen	the	r esurgence	of	sales	in	
our	exchange	systems	business.	It	is	our	
opinion	that	Patsystems	has	a	unique	
pr oposition	in	the	global	market	place	
with	our	ability	to	pr ovide	exchange	
matching,	clearing,	trading	and	risk	
capability	as	an	integrated	package	and	
this	year’ s	success	r eflects	that.
W e	believe	that	ther e	ar e	opportunities	
acr oss	the	globe	for	smaller	or	newly	
established	commodity	or	financial	futur es	
exchanges	that	want	a	complete	end-to-
end	technology	solution	and	wish	to	
sour ce	this	fr om	a	single	supplier .
The	Indonesian	Commodity	and	
Derivatives	Exchange	has	adopted	the	
Patsystems	trading	system	and	exchange	
matching	pr oducts	to	fulfil	its	vision	of	
enabling	market	participants	to	trade	
r egional	commodity	pr oducts	such	as	
crude	palm	oil,	coal,	natural	gas,	cocoa,	
cof fee	and	tin	within	the	Asian	time	zone.	
The	market	will	be	fully	operational	early	
in	2010	in	a	pr oject	that	commenced	in	
summer	2009.
The	T urkish	Derivatives	Exchange	
(‘T urkDEX’)	has	contracted	to	install	the	
complete	suite	of	Patsystems’	pr oducts	
and	will	be	allowing	T akasbank,	their	
clearing	house	access	to	the	Risk	Informer	
pr oduct	to	benefit	their	clearing	services.	
T urkDEX	has	experienced	substantial	
business	gr owth	over	the	last	five	years	
and	in	2009	was	ranked	the	world’ s	22nd	
largest	futur es	exchange	by	volume,	with	
ambitions	for	further	gr owth.	T urkDEX	
selected	Patsystems	after	an	extensive	
global	selection	pr ocess	because	they	wer e	
confident	that	Patsystems’	technology	
would	ensur e	the	exchange	achieves	its

As Richard and David have already 
reported this has been another 
successful year both in terms of the 
level of adjusted profit and the

Adjusted profit increased to £3.9 
million from £3.7 million in 2008 and 
operating cash flow also improved by 
21% to £4.3 million from £3.6 million 
in the prior year. As a result of the net 
cash increase of £3.0 million the Group 
ended the year with a cash balance of 
£8.9 million.

is	£0.8	million.
Staf f	costs	incr eased	by	£0.9	million	as	a

time	being	capitalised	into	development	
pr ojects	and	the	costs	of	establishing	a

In	addition	to	the	incr ease	in	staf f	costs,

withholding	tax	may	or	may	not	arise		
fr om	time	to	time	depending	on	the

pr eviously	discussed	Risk	Systems	continue

Intangible Assets
During	the	year	the	Gr oup	expended	£0.7

total	cr edit	of	£1.0	million	was	cr edited		
to	the	income	statement.	(2008:	£0.9

Current Liabilities
The	key	movement	within	curr ent	liabilities	
r elates	to	a	decr ease	in	deferr ed	income		
of	£2.0	million.	This	is	primarily	due	to	the	
change	in	timing	of	billing	of	two	large	
customers	fr om	annually	in	advance	to	
monthly	and	quarterly	billing.
Other	elements	of	curr ent	liabilities	have

Cash and Treasury 
Cash	and	cash	equivalents	incr eased	to

and	tangible	assets,	with	dividends	of		
£0.7	million	(2008:	£0.6	million)	being

The	Gr oup	is	exposed	to	for eign	curr ency	
risk	on	sales,	pur chases	and	cash	balances	
that	ar e	denominated	in	a	curr ency	other	
than	Sterling.	The	principal	curr ency	giving

has	a	policy	to	carry	forwar d	cover	for	
75%	of	US$/£	net	anticipated	exposur e	
for	12	months	forwar d.	That	level	of	cover

Bad Debts

a	risk	that	a	client	could	experience

Directors’ Report Patsystems Plc
Annual report and accounts 2009 17
Governance
Details of the Directors who have an interest in share options are 
disclosed in the Remuneration report.
Save as disclosed in this report and note 28, there were no other 
contracts subsisting during or at the end of the financial year in 
which a Director of the Company is or was materially interested.
Employee Involvement
The Directors recognise the importance of employee involvement 
established by good communications and working relationships. 
The decentralised nature of the Group’s activities necessitates that 
the practical application of this policy is the responsibility of local 
management in a manner appropriate to their circumstances.
Employment Policies
The Group is committed to the terms of the Codes of Practice for 
the elimination of all or any discrimination and to the promotion 
of equality of opportunities in employment.
It is Group policy to afford equal opportunities to all employees 
and job applicants. No employee or job applicant is less 
favourably treated than another on the grounds of their sex, 
sexual orientation, age, marital status, religion, race, nationality, 
ethnic or national origin, colour or disability and all appointments 
and promotions are determined solely by merit.
It is also Group policy to encourage and assist in the 
employment, training, re-training and career development of 
disabled persons where possible, having regard to their suitability 
for a particular vacancy and the nature of the Group’s activities. 
In the event that employees become disabled during 
employment the Group will where possible continue their 
employment and arrange appropriate training.
Responsibility for monitoring the effective working of these 
policies is vested in Martin Thorneycroft, the Finance Director.
Financial Instruments and Financial Risk Management
The Group’s activities expose it to a variety of financial risks and  
it has developed and operates an overall risk management 
programme that recognises the unpredictability of financial 
markets and seeks to minimise potential adverse effects on the 
Group’s financial performance. 
Financial risk management is under the control of the Finance 
Director and is carried out centrally for the Group in compliance 
with policies approved and monitored by the full Board. The 
Board regularly reviews the effectiveness of these policies 
examining specific areas including foreign exchange risk, interest 
rate risk, credit risk and the extent to which financial instruments 
are being used to hedge certain risk exposures. 
Details of the Group’s exposures to market, credit and liquidity 
risks are set out in note 3 to the financial statements.
Research and Development
During the year the Company continued to invest in research and 
development (‘R&D’). All expenditure, whether incurred through 
internal staff costs or through third party suppliers, relating to 
R&D that satisfies the criteria for capitalisation under IAS 38, 
‘Intangible assets’, is capitalised. Otherwise it is written off to the 
income statement in the period incurred.
Creditor Payment Policy
Given the international nature of the Group’s operations, there is 
no standard code for the Group in respect of payments to 
suppliers. Operating subsidiaries are responsible for agreeing 
terms and conditions for their business transactions when orders 
for goods and services are placed, ensuring that suppliers are 
aware of the terms of payment and including the relevant terms 
in contracts where appropriate. These arrangements are adhered 
to provided that suppliers meet their contractual commitments.
Creditor days have not been calculated for the Company as it is 
an investment holding company.
Charitable and Political Donations
The Group made charitable contributions of £2,409 during the 
year (2008: £500). The current year donations were made to 
Alzheimers Association, The Manna Society, East Anglian Air 
Ambulance, The Tiltas Trust and St Raphael’s Hospice. No political 
donations were made in 2009 or 2008.
Disclosure of Information to Auditors
For each of the persons who were Directors at the time this 
report was prepared, the following applies:
So far as the Directors are aware, there is no relevant •	
information of which the Company’s auditors are unaware; 
and
The Directors have taken all the steps that they ought to have •	
taken as Directors in order to make themselves aware of any 
relevant audit information and to establish that the 
Company’s auditors are aware of that information.
Disclosure and Transparency Rules (‘DTR’)
The Company has complied with the DTR so far as they are 
applicable to AIM listed companies.
Annual General Meeting
The Notice convening the Annual General Meeting (‘AGM’) 
together with the proposed resolutions is being sent to 
shareholders. The AGM will be held on 27 April 2010.

Governance
Statement of Directors’ Responsibilities
Company law requires the Directors to prepare financial 
statements for each financial year, which give a true and fair 
view of the state of affairs of the Company and the Group, as at 
the end of the year, and of the profit or loss of the Group for the 
year. In preparing those financial statements, the Directors are 
required to:
1. Select suitable accounting policies and then apply  
them consistently;
2. Make judgements and estimates that are reasonable  
and prudent;
3. State whether applicable accounting standards have been 
followed, subject to any material departures disclosed and 
explained in the financial statements;
4. Prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis 
unless it is inappropriate to presume that the Group will 
continue in business.
The Directors confirm that the financial statements comply with 
the above requirements.
The Directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity 
of the Patsystems website. Information published on the internet 
is accessible in many countries with different legal requirements. 
Legislation in the United Kingdom governing the preparation and 
dissemination of financial statements may differ from legislation 
in other jurisdictions.
The Directors are responsible for maintaining proper accounting 
records which disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the 
financial position of the Company and the Group and enable 
them to ensure that the financial statements comply with the 
Companies Act 2006 (as amended from time to time). The 
Directors are also responsible for safeguarding the assets of the 
Company and the Group and hence for taking reasonable steps 
for the prevention and detection of fraud and other irregularities.

Directors’ Report

Annual report and accounts 2009 19
Governance
The following statement of corporate governance reflects the 
position of the Group as at 31 December 2009.
The Board is responsible for the Group’s corporate governance 
policy and recognises the importance of high standards of 
integrity, and consistently seeks to apply the principles set out in 
the Combined Code on Corporate Governance (the ‘Code’) to 
the extent that they are appropriate for, and applicable to, a 
company of Patsystems’ size quoted on the Alternative 
Investment Market (‘AIM’).
Directors
Details of the dates of appointment and resignation of Directors 
within the year are shown in the Directors’ Report. All Directors 
are subject to re-election within a three-year period. The roles of 
the Chairman and Chief Executive are separate and have been so 
throughout the year.
The Non-Executive Directors are considered to be ‘independent’ 
within the definition contained in the Code. 
The Non-Executive Directors meet, without the presence of the 
Executive Directors, whenever it is appropriate for them to do so.
All the Directors have access to the advice of the Company 
Secretary and may, in furtherance of their duties, take 
independent legal and financial advice at the Company’s 
expense. They also have access to the minutes of the Board, in 
which any concerns expressed by them regarding matters 
pertaining to the Group are recorded.
While there is no formal process, the performance and 
effectiveness of each Director, including the Non-Executive 
Directors, is assessed on an on-going basis by the other  
members of the Board.
Board Meetings
The Board generally meets monthly and at such other times as 
required, and receives regular reports on a wide range of key 
issues including operational performance, risk management and 
corporate strategy.
The Board’s accountability is demonstrated by the adoption of a 
formal schedule of matters specifically reserved to the Board for 
its decision concerning all key areas across the Group’s activities, 
thereby ensuring that all major decisions affecting the Group are 
taken at Board level. All the Directors are free to bring any matter 
to the attention of the Board, at any time.
Committees
The Audit Committee and the combined Remuneration and 
Nominations Committee meet at least twice a year.
Audit Committee
The Audit Committee is chaired by John Priestley and comprises 
all the Non-Executive Directors. The external auditors, together 
with the Finance Director and other financial staff are invited to 
attend these meetings as and when required.
In accordance with its terms of reference the principal function 
of this committee is to determine the appropriateness of 
accounting policies to be used in the Group’s annual results. In 
addition the Committee is responsible for monitoring the 
independence of the Group auditors, assessing the Group’s audit 
arrangements and the Group’s system of internal controls, and 
reviewing the half-yearly and annual results before publication.
Remuneration and Nominations Committee
The Remuneration and Nominations Committee comprises all the 
Non-Executive Directors and is chaired by Steve Sparke. 
In accordance with its terms of reference the Committee 
determines the level and make-up of remuneration (including 
bonuses and options) of the Executive Directors and certain 
senior management. This also includes formulation of 
remuneration policy throughout the Group, embracing both 
share options and bonuses.
The Committee also evaluates the balance of skills, knowledge 
and experience on the Board and considers all new Board 
appointments and re-appointments against this evaluation.
The Report of the Board on Directors’ Remuneration and on 
Group Remuneration Policy giving details of Company policy and 
individual Directors’ remuneration is set out on pages 21 to 23. 
The remuneration arrangements of the Non-Executive Directors 
are determined by the Board as a whole.
The notice period provisions contained in the Directors’ service 
agreements are summarised on page 22 of these accounts.
Executive Management Committee
The Executive Management Committee (the ‘EMC’), under the 
Chairmanship of the Chief Executive, or in his absence the 
Finance Director, meets monthly and is responsible for the 
day-to-day running of the Group. The members of the EMC are 
the two Executive Directors of the Company, together with the 
five key business heads who are not Directors.
Relations with Shareholders
The Board welcomes the views of shareholders.
The AGM is used as an opportunity to communicate with 
shareholders. All shareholders are encouraged to attend the 
Company’s AGM, in order to take advantage of the opportunity 
to ask questions of the Directors.
Shareholders may also contact the Company in writing or via its 
website, which is regularly updated. Additional information is 
supplied through the circulation of the Interim Report and the 
Annual Report and Accounts. During the year the Company 
issued a series of announcements to the Stock Exchange. The 
Chief Executive, Finance Director and the Chairman from time to 
time meet individual and institutional shareholders and provide 
such information as is permissible in order to facilitate a better 
understanding of the Group’s business and operations.
Statement of Corporate Governance Patsystems Plc
Annual report and accounts 2009 20
Governance
Internal Control
The Board of Directors has overall responsibility both for the 
Group’s system of internal controls, which includes internal 
financial controls and for reviewing their effectiveness. The 
Directors recognise that no system of internal control can provide 
absolute assurance. The Group’s systems are designed to manage 
the risk of failure to achieve business objectives and therefore 
can only provide the Directors with reasonable assurance against 
material misstatement or loss.
The key elements of the Group’s internal control system, which 
have been operational for the whole of the financial year, are  
as follows:
Management Structure •	
 The Board has overall responsibility for the Group and there is 
a formal schedule of matters specifically reserved for decision 
by the Board. Each Executive Director has been given 
responsibility for specific aspects of the Group’s affairs. 
Reporting to the Chief Executive, is the EMC which is 
responsible for the day to day running of the Group’s affairs.
Monitoring Systems used by the Board •	
 The Board receives regular reports on the financial and 
business performance of the Group. The Board is regularly 
advised through these reports on the working capital position 
and financial performance relative to the Group’s approved 
budget.
Internal Audit •	
 The Board reviews from time to time the need for an Internal 
Audit function and remains of the opinion that the systems of 
internal financial control are appropriate to the Group’s 
present activities and that such a function is unnecessary.
Going Concern
The Directors have reasonable expectation that the Company 
and the Group have adequate resources to continue in 
operational existence for the foreseeable future. For this reason 
they continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the 
financial statements.
Compliance Statement
Corporate Governance procedures are subject to regular review 
by the Board. Throughout the year the Directors believe that the 
Group has complied with the provisions as set out in Section 1 of 
the Code, to the extent that they are appropriate for, and 
applicable to, a company of Patsystems’ size quoted on AIM.

Report of the Board on Directors’ Remuneration and on  
Group Remuneration Policy
Remuneration Committee
The Remuneration Committee, which comprises all of, and only, 
Non-Executive Directors, determines Group remuneration policy 
and the remuneration (including bonuses and options) of 
Executive Directors and certain other senior management.
Policy on Group Remuneration
The Company’s policy is to set the remuneration of senior 
executives (including Executive Directors) at a level to attract and 
retain executives of appropriate ability and experience to manage 
the affairs of the Company. This approach contains costs, 
improves employee benefits and increases the Company’s 
competitiveness in the market for scarce skills. In formulating its 
remuneration policy, the Remuneration Committee is mindful of 
the competitive pressures inherent in a sector that straddles both 
the software and financial services industries. It is the Company’s 
policy that a significant element of total remuneration is related 
to the financial performance of the Company. Remuneration is 
reviewed annually.
The Remuneration Package
The remuneration package comprises base salary and benefits, 
pension contributions, annual bonus and long term incentive 
arrangements.  All senior employees of the Group (including  
the Executive Directors) are remunerated using the policy 
described below.
Base Salary and Benefits
Base salary takes into account the performance of the individual 
and information from independent sources on market levels of 
remuneration. The Executive Directors’ basic salaries are reviewed 
by the Committee prior to the beginning of each year.  The 
Executive Directors are also entitled to private medical, death in 
service, critical illness and permanent health insurance and 
subsidised health club membership.
Pension Contributions
The Group operates a defined contribution pension scheme for 
eligible UK employees.  Neither of the Executive Directors are 
members of this scheme; the Executive Directors receive a 
Company contribution to their individual pension arrangements.
Annual Bonuses
Bonus scheme arrangements are in place for all members of 
staff, including the Executive Directors.  Bonuses for the 
Executive Directors are linked to the performance of the Group 
and staff bonuses are based on individual performance
Long-term Incentives
Share Options
The Group operates two share option plans – an Enterprise 
Management Incentive Share Option Scheme (‘EMI’) and a 
standard unapproved share option scheme.  All senior staff, 
including the Executive Directors participate in both schemes.
Options awarded under the first of three main grants vested in 
full in 2006. 76% of the options awarded under the second and 
third grants have currently vested and the remaining 24% of 
these options will vest on 8 February 2010.
The Company has also made a number of special awards under 
both schemes to Directors and senior employees which will vest 
in between one and three years from the date of grant subject to 
certain performance conditions. 
Cash-Based Long-Term Incentive Scheme
During 2007 the Group introduced a new cash-based long-term 
incentive scheme (‘the Cash Scheme’). The maximum conditional 
award allowable under the three year Cash Scheme is 100% of 
salary with each award vesting no earlier than the third 
anniversary from date of grant and vesting being subject to 
achievement of performance conditions and continued 
employment (‘the Awards’). When the Awards to the Directors 
vest, they will be expected to use 50% of the net of tax amount 
to purchase the Company’s shares in the open market until such 
time as a total personal shareholding has been achieved which is 
equivalent to 100% of base salary. In the event of a change of 
control (eg a takeover) the Awards will vest provided the 
Remuneration Committee is satisfied that it is fair and reasonable 
for them to do so (eg. that the terms of a takeover implicitly 
reflect prospective performance on a scale that would have 
resulted in full vesting).
 
The performance conditions attached to the Awards require 
adjusted fully diluted pre-deferred tax EPS growth from the  
2006 financial year to the 2009 financial year of between  
10% compound per annum to 30% compound per annum  
for between 30% and 100% of the Award to vest. The Awards 
vest on a straight line basis between minimum and maximum 
thresholds. The scheme is expected to vest in full during the first 
half of 2010.
Share-Based Long-Term Incentive Scheme
It is the Remuneration Committee’s intention to introduce a new 
scheme from 1 January 2010. The Scheme will be open to the 
Executive Directors and senior staff.
An annual award of shares will be made to participants on an 
individual basis up to a maximum award of 50% of basic salary. 
The actual level of award will be determined on the growth in 
EPS in the previous year. No award will be made if EPS (calculated 
on an adjusted profit basis as detailed in the Finance Director’s 
review) growth is less than 5%. The maximum award will be 
granted if EPS growth reaches 20%, with a pro rata award being 
granted between 5% and 20%. Once granted the shares will 
vest four years from date of grant provided the individual is still 
employed by the Company, and compound annual EPS growth 
over the relevant period is at least 10%. If the compound annual 
EPS growth is less than 10% then the award will lapse. Patsystems Plc

Reporting Standards (‘IFRSs’) as adopted by the European Union.
Respective Responsibilities of Directors and Auditors
As explained more fully in the Directors’ Responsibilities 
Statement set out on page 18, the Directors are responsible for 
the preparation of the financial statements and for being 
satisfied that they give a true and fair view. Our responsibility is 
to audit the financial statements in accordance with applicable 
law and International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland). 
Those standards require us to comply with the Auditing Practices 
Board’s Ethical Standards for Auditors.
This report, including the opinions, has been prepared for and 
only for the Company’s members as a body in accordance with

may come save where expressly agreed by our prior consent  
in writing.
Scope of the Audit of the Financial Statements
An audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts  
and disclosures in the financial statements sufficient to give 
reasonable assurance that the financial statements are free  
from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or error. 
This includes an assessment of: whether the accounting policies 
are appropriate to the Group’s circumstances and have  
been consistently applied and adequately disclosed; the 
reasonableness of significant accounting estimates made  
by the directors; and the overall presentation of the financial 
statements.

adopted by the European Union; and

the Companies Act 2006.

Notes to the Financial Statements
1. Accounting Policies
The principal accounting policies applied in the preparation of these consolidated financial statements are set out below. These 
policies have been consistently applied to all the years presented, unless otherwise stated.
1.1 Accounting Convention and Basis of Preparation
These financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) and IFRIC 
interpretations endorsed by the European Union (EU) and with those parts of the Companies Act 1985/2006 applicable to 
companies reporting under IFRS. 
The results and net assets of subsidiary undertakings acquired are included in the consolidated income statement and consolidated 
balance sheet using the acquisition method of accounting from the effective date of acquisition.
These consolidated financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention, with the exception of financial 
instruments which are stated in accordance with IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement.
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with IFRS requires the use of certain critical accounting estimates. It also 
requires management to exercise its judgement in the process of applying the Group’s accounting policies. The areas involving a 
high degree of judgement or complexity, or areas where assumptions and estimates are significant to the consolidated financial 
statements, are disclosed in note 2.
Standards, Amendments and Interpretations Effective in 2009
IFRS 7 ‘Financial instruments – Disclosures’ (amendment) – effective 1 January 2009. The amendment requires enhanced •	
disclosures about fair value measurement and liquidity risk. 
IAS 1 (revised). ‘Presentation of financial statements’ – effective 1 January 2009. The revised standard prohibits the presentation •	
of items of income and expenses (that is, ‘non-owner changes in equity’) in the statement of changes in equity, requiring 
‘non-owner changes in equity’ to be presented separately from owner changes in equity in a statement of comprehensive 
income. 
IFRS 2 (amendment), ‘Share-based payment’ (effective 1 January 2009) deals with vesting conditions and cancellations. It clarifies •	
that vesting conditions are service conditions and performance conditions only. Other features of a share-based payment are not 
vesting conditions. 
The above amendments do not have a material impact on the Group or Company’s financial statements.
Standards, Amendments and Interpretations to Existing Standards that are not yet Effective and have not been  
Adopted Early by the Group
The following standards, amendments and interpretations to existing standards have been published and are mandatory for the 
Group’s accounting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2010 or later periods, but the Group has not early adopted them:
 
IFRS 3 (revised), ‘Business combinations’ (effective from 1 July 2009). The revised standard continues to apply the acquisition •	
method to business combinations, with some significant changes. For example, all payments to purchase a business are to be 
recorded at fair value at the acquisition date, with contingent payments classified as debt subsequently re-measured through the 
income statement. There is a choice on an acquisition-by-acquisition basis to measure the non-controlling interest in the acquiree 
either at fair vale or at the non-controlling interest’s proportionate share of the acquiree’s net assets. All acquisition-related costs 
should be expensed. The Group will apply IFRS 3 (revised) prospectively to all business combinations from 1 January 2010.
The following amendments are not expected to have a material impact on the Group or Company’s financial statements:
IFRS 2 (amendments), ‘Group cash-settled share-based payment transaction (effective from 1 January 2010’. In addition to •	
incorporating IFRIC 8, ‘Scope of IFRS 2’, and IFRIC 11, ‘IFRS 2 - Group and treasury share transactions’, the amendments expand 
on the guidance in IFRIC 11 to address the classification of group arrangements that were not covered by that interpretation. 
IFRS 5 (amendment), ‘Non-current assets held for sale and discontinued operations’. The amendment provides clarification that •	
IFRS 5 specifies the disclosures required in respect of non-current assets (or disposal groups) classified as held for sale or 
discontinued operations. The Group and Company will apply IFRS 5 (amendment) from 1 January 2010. 
IFRIC 17, ‘Distribution of non-cash assets to owners’ (effective on or after 1 July 2009). This interpretation provides guidance on •	
accounting for arrangements whereby an entity distributes non-cash assets to shareholders either as a distribution of reserves or 
as dividends. 
IAS 27 (revised), ‘Consolidated and separate financial statements’, (effective from 1 July 2009). •	 Patsystems Plc
Annual report and accounts 2009 31
Financial Statements
IAS 38 (amendment), ‘Intangible Assets’. The amendment clarifies guidance in measuring the fair value of an intangible asset •	
acquired in a business combination and it permits the grouping of intangible assets as a single asset if each asset has similar 
useful economic lives. 
IAS 1 (amendment), ‘Presentation of financial statements’. The amendment provides clarification that the potential settlement of •	
a liability by the issue of equity is not relevant to its classification as current or non current. By amending the definition of current 
liability, the amendment permits a liability to be classified as non-current (provided that the entity has an unconditional right to 
defer settlement by transfer of cash or other assets for at least 12 months after the accounting period) notwithstanding the fact 
that the entity could be required by the counterparty to settle in shares at any time. The Group and Company will apply IAS 1 
(amendment) from 1 January 2010. 
1.2 Foreign Currency Translation
Functional and Presentation Currency
Items included in the financial statements of each of the Group entities are measured using the currency of the primary economic 
environment in which the entity operates (the ‘functional currency’). The consolidated financial statements are presented in Pounds 
Sterling, which is the parent Company’s functional and presentation currency.
Transactions and Balances
Foreign currency transactions are translated into the functional currency using the exchange rates prevailing at the dates of the 
transactions. Foreign exchange gains and losses resulting from the settlement of such transactions and from the translation at year 
end exchange rates of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are recognised in the income statement.
Group Companies
The results and financial position of all Group entities (none of which has the currency of a hyper-inflationary economy) that have a 
functional currency different from the presentation currency are translated into the presentation currency as follows:
assets and liabilities for each balance sheet presented are translated at the closing rate at the date of that balance sheet; •	
income and expenses for each income statement are translated at average exchange rates; and •	
all resulting exchange differences are recognised in reserves. •	
1.3 Goodwill
Goodwill represents the excess of the cost of an acquisition over the fair value of the Group’s share of the net identifiable assets of the 
acquired subsidiary at the date of acquisition. Goodwill is tested annually for impairment and carried at cost less accumulated 
impairment losses. The carrying value of capitalised goodwill is also reviewed if events or changes in circumstances indicate a potential 
impairment. Any impairment is charged to the income statement. Gains and losses on the disposal of an entity include the carrying 
amount of goodwill relating to the entity sold. Goodwill is allocated to cash-generating units for the purpose of impairment testing.
1.4 Intangible Assets 
Computer software licences are capitalised on the basis of the costs incurred to acquire and bring to use the specific software. The 
software acquired in the Tamesis acquisition was capitalised at fair value. These costs are amortised over their estimated useful lives 
(three years). Costs associated with maintaining computer software programmes are recognised as an expense as incurred.
1.5 Impairment of Assets
Assets that have an indefinite useful life are not subject to amortisation and are tested annually for impairment and whenever 
events or changes in circumstance indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. Assets that are subject to amortisation 
are tested for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstance indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. An 
impairment loss is recognised for the amount by which the assets carrying value exceeds its recoverable amount. The recoverable 
amount is the higher of an asset’s fair value less costs to sell and value in use. For the purposes of assessing impairment, assets are 
grouped at the lowest levels for which there are separately identifiable cash flows (cash generating units).
1.6 Research and Development
Research expenditure is recognised as an expense as incurred. Costs directly attributable to development are capitalised as 
intangible assets when it is probable that the development will provide economic benefits, considering its commercial and technical 
feasibility, resources are available for the development and costs can be measured reliably. Other development expenditures are 
recognised as costs when incurred. Capitalised product development is amortised from completion of development over periods of 
between three and five years.

Property, plant and equipment is shown at cost less subsequent depreciation. Cost includes expenditure that is directly attributable 
to the acquisition of the items. Patsystems Plc

Financial Statements
1. Accounting Policies continued
1.7 Property, Plant and Equipment continued
Depreciation on assets is calculated using the straight-line method to reduce the cost of each asset to its estimated residual value 
over its estimated useful life, as follows:
Leasehold improvements – over the period of the lease
Plant and equipment – over 3 years
Office furniture, fixtures and fittings – over 4 years
1.8 Current and Deferred Income Taxes
The current income tax charge is calculated on the basis of the tax laws enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date 
in the countries in which the Company and its subsidiaries operate and generate taxable income. Management periodically 
evaluates positions taken in tax returns with respect to situations in which applicable tax regulations are subject to interpretation 
and establishes provisions where appropriate on the basis of amounts expected to be paid to the tax authorities.
Deferred income tax is provided in full, using the liability method, on temporary differences arising between the tax bases of assets 
and liabilities and their carrying amounts in the consolidated financial statements. The deferred income tax is not accounted for on 
the initial recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction, other than a business combination, that at the time of the transaction 
affects neither accounting nor taxable profit or loss. Deferred income tax is determined using tax rates (and laws) that have been 
enacted or substantially enacted by the balance sheet date and are expected to apply when the related deferred income tax asset is 
realised or the deferred income tax liability is settled.
Deferred income tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which 
the temporary differences can be utilised.
Deferred income tax is provided on temporary differences arising on investments in subsidiaries except where the timing of the 
reversal of the temporary difference is controlled by the Group and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in 
the foreseeable future.
Deferred income tax balances are not discounted.
1.9 Inventories
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value. 
1.10 Financial Assets
The Group classifies its financial assets between ‘assets at fair value through profit or loss’ and ‘loans and receivables’. The 
classification depends on the purpose for which the financial assets were acquired. Management determines the classification of its 
financial assets at initial recognition. 
Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss are financial assets held for trading. A financial asset is classified in this category if 
acquired principally for the purpose of selling in the short term. Derivatives are also categorised as held for trading unless they are 
designated as hedges. Assets in this category are classified as current assets.
 
Purchases and sales of financial assets are recognised on the trade-date – the date on which the Group commits to purchase or sell 
the asset. Financial assets are initially recognised at fair value and transaction costs are expensed in the income statement. Financial 
assets are derecognised when the rights to receive cash flows from the investments have expired or have been transferred and the 
Group has transferred substantially all risks and rewards of ownership. 
Gains or losses arising from changes in the fair value of the financial assets are presented in the income statement in the period in 
which they arise. 
The Group assesses at each balance sheet date whether there is objective evidence that a financial asset or a Group of financial 
assets is impaired. Impairment testing of trade receivables is described in note 1.12.
1.11 Accounting for Derivative Financial Instruments and Hedging Activities
The Group enters into forward currency contracts and options in order to hedge against the cash flow risk of foreign currency 
exchange rate movements. Derivatives are initially recognised at fair value on the date the contract is entered into and subsequently 
re-measured in future periods at their fair value. The movement in fair values is taken to the income statement.
Notes to the Financial Statements
continued Patsystems Plc
Annual report and accounts 2009 33
Financial Statements
The fair value of forward contracts is determined using forward exchange market rates at the balance sheet date.
1.12 Trade Receivables
Trade receivables are recognised initially at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest 
method, less provision for impairment. A provision for impairment of trade receivables is established when there is objective 
evidence that the Group will not be able to collect all amounts due under the original terms of the receivables. Significant financial 
difficulties of the debtor, probability that the debtor will enter bankruptcy or financial reorganisation and default or delinquency in 
payments are considered indicators that the trade receivable may be impaired. The amount of the provision is the difference 
between the asset’s carrying amount and the present value of estimated future cash flows, discounted at the original effective 
interest rate. The carrying amount of the asset is reduced through the use of an allowance account, and the amount of the loss is 
recognised in the income statement within ‘operating expenses’. When a trade receivable is uncollectible, it is written off against 
the allowance account for trade receivables. Subsequent recoveries of amounts previously written off are credited against ‘operating 
expenses’ in the income statement. 
1.13 Cash and Cash Equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents includes cash in hand, cash in transit, deposits held at call with banks, other short term highly liquid 
investments with original maturities of three months or less, and bank overdrafts.
Cash in transit represents the net amount of monies due to Group companies that have been paid to independent clearing agents 
and are pending release by overseas withholding tax authorities.
1.14 Trade Payables
Trade payables are recognised initially at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective  
interest method.
1.15 Leases
Costs in respect of operating leases are charged to the income statement on a straight line basis over the lease term. 
1.16 Provisions
Provisions are measured at the present value of the expenditures expected to be required to settle the obligation using a pre-tax 
rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the obligation. This relates to 
provisions including dilapidations and long term share incentive schemes.
1.17 Segment Reporting
Operating segments are reported in a manner consistent with the internal reporting provided to the chief operating decision-maker. 
The chief operating decision-maker, who is responsible for allocating resources and assessing performance of the operating 
segments, has been identified as the Board of Directors.
1.18 Revenue Recognition
Revenue comprises the fair value of the sale of goods and services, net of value added tax. Revenue is recognised as follows:
Non-refundable installation income, consultancy and software development projects: revenue is taken to the income statement •	
in line with the performance of the work. 
Monthly end user or lot charges, monthly maintenance and income on any rentals – these are credited to the income statement •	
in the period in which the service is provided.
Income from perpetual licences – this is recognised in the income statement when the Company has fulfilled all of its obligations •	
in accordance with the terms for acceptance set out in the customer contracts and the Company has reasonable assurance over 
the collectability of the debt.
Revenue relating to development projects is recognised using the percentage of completion method, based primarily on contract •	
costs incurred to date, compared to estimated overall contract costs. 
1.19 Employee Benefits
Pension Obligations
The Group operates a defined contribution scheme which is open to UK and US employees.
The Group pays contributions to publicly or privately administered pension insurance schemes on a mandatory, contractual or 
voluntary basis. The Group has no further payment obligations once the contributions have been paid. The contributions are 
recognised as employee benefit expense when they are due. Patsystems Plc
Annual report and accounts 2009 34
Financial Statements
1. Accounting Policies continued
1.19 Employee Benefits continued
Termination Benefits
Termination benefits are payable when employment is terminated before the normal retirement date, or when an employee accepts 
voluntary redundancy in exchange for these benefits. The Group recognises termination benefits when it is demonstrably 
committed to either: terminating the employment of current employees according to a detailed formal plan without possibility of 
withdrawal; or providing termination benefits as a result of an offer made to encourage voluntary redundancy.
Share-Based Benefits
The Group operates two share options schemes; the Enterprise Management Incentive Scheme and the 2003 Share Option Scheme 
(Inland Revenue unapproved). 
The fair value of options is recognised as an employee benefit expense with a corresponding increase in reserves over the vesting 
period. The proceeds received net of any directly attributable transaction costs are credited to share capital (nominal value) and 
share premium when the options are exercised. A detailed explanation of how the fair values have been derived can be seen in  
note 23.
Cash-Based Long-Term Incentive Benefits
The Group has introduced a cash-based long-term incentive scheme (‘the Cash Scheme’) in 2007 and awards were granted to the 
Executive Directors and to certain senior and key employees. These awards are conditional upon the rate of growth in fully diluted 
pre-deferred tax EPS over the period from 31 December 2006 to 31 December 2009. The cost of these awards has been estimated 
based on projected EPS growth and is recognised as an employee benefit expense on a straight line basis over the period from grant 
to March 2010.
Other Benefits
UK employees are also entitled to private medical, death in service insurance, critical illness and long term sickness insurance and 
subsidised health club membership. The costs of providing these benefits are recognised as employee benefit expense as they  
fall due.
This year the Group has introduced a flexible benefits scheme that enables employees to tailor their total remuneration packages to 
meet their own individual lifestyle and family requirements. 
1.20 Dividend Distributions 
Final dividend distributions to the Company’s shareholders are recognised as liabilities in the Group’s financial statements in the 
period in which the dividends are approved by the Company’s shareholders. Interim dividend distributions to the Company’s 
shareholders are recognised as liabilities in the Group’s financial statements when paid.
2. Critical Accounting Estimates and Judgements
Estimates and judgements are continually evaluated and are based on historical experience and other factors, including expectations 
of future events that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances.
The Group makes estimates and assumptions concerning the future. The resulting accounting estimates will, by definition, seldom 
equal the related actual results. The estimates and assumptions that have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the 
carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial year are addressed below:
IRFS 2 share based payment charge and the provision for the cash-based long term incentive scheme, where judgement has been •	
applied as to the number of awards expected to vest.
Capitalisation of research and development costs. •	
Impairment reviews for intangible assets. •	
Development projects, where the percentage completion method is used. This requires the Group to estimate the development •	
performed to date as a proportion of the total development to be performed. Another uncertainty is the expected total profit.
Deferred tax, see note 15. •

3. Financial risk management
The Group’s activities expose it to a variety of financial risks and it has developed and operates an overall risk management 
programme that recognises the unpredictability of financial markets and seeks to minimise potential adverse effects on the Group’s 
financial performance. 
Financial risk management is under the control of the Finance Director and is carried out centrally for the Group in compliance with 
policies approved and monitored by the full Board. The Board regularly reviews the effectiveness of these policies examining specific 
areas including foreign exchange risk, interest rate risk, credit risk and the extent to which financial instruments are being used to 
hedge certain risk exposures. 
3.1 Market Risk 
The principal market risk to which the the Group is exposed is foreign currency risk on sales, purchases and cash balances that are 
denominated in a currency other than Sterling. The principal currency giving rise to this risk is the US Dollar. Patsystems’ policy is to 
carry forward cover for 75% of US$/£ net anticipated exposure for 12 months forward. Forward cover is achieved through a mixture 
of forward contracts and options. This policy has remained unchanged throughout both 2009 and 2008 although the level of cover 
and the exposure to risks on other foreign currencies are kept under regular review.
The average US$/£ exchange rate used in the 2009 income statement was 1.57 (2008: 1.84). The average rate of the hedges in 
place at 31 December 2009 for 2010 was 1.60 (2008 for 2009: 1.77). The fair value of these hedges is recognised as a financial 
asset of £176,000 (2008: liability £853,000) on the Group balance sheet at the year end.
The Group has certain investments in foreign operations, whose net assets are exposed to foreign currency translation risk. This 
exposure is minimised by a Group policy requiring individual subsidiaries to remit any surplus funds to the Parent Company to 
facilitate central management as set out above and to enable each individual subsidiary to match remaining assets and liabilities 
denominated in their specific functional currencies.
During the year ended 31 December 2009 the US$/£ exchange rate fluctuated between 1.42 and 1.65 (2008 between 1.45 and 
1.99). At 31 December 2009, if the US$ had weakened/strengthened by 20% against the £ with all other variables held constant, 
post tax profit for the year would have been £630,000 (2008: £647,000) lower/higher, mainly as a result of foreign exchange  
gains/losses on translation of US$ denominated trade receivables.
The Group is also exposed to interest rate risks on the fair values of the hedging instruments that it holds and on the cash flows 
arising from any interest bearing cash deposits. These assets are regularly realised to settle trade and other payables as part of the 
Group’s management of its liquidity risks. The Group has no material borrowings and accordingly, exposures to interest rate risks are 
not regarded as significant.
3.2 Credit Risk 
Credit risk arises from cash and cash equivalents and from credit exposures to the Group’s customers, including outstanding 
receivables and committed transactions. Credit risk is managed centrally with regular reports of exposures reviewed by the Board. 
The Group does not set individual credit limits but will seek to ensure that counterparties enter into legally enforceable contracts 
that include settlement terms that demonstrate the counterparties’ commitment to the transaction and minimise this risk exposure. 
The Board does not assess the credit quality of financial assets by reference to external credit ratings, but will regularly examine the 
ageing of financial assets and individual counterparty historic default rates. An aged analysis of trade receivables at 31 December 
2009 is set out in note 17. 
3.3 Liquidity Risk 
The Group has no borrowings or committed credit lines and its liquidity management policy is carried out at a local level and 
involves projecting cash flows in major currencies and considering the levels of liquid assets necessary to meet these. Requirements 
are overseen by the Board with Group levels of cash and cash equivalents reviewed on a monthly basis. A maturity analysis of trade 
and other payables is shown in note 19.
3.4 Capital Risk Management
The Group’s objectives when managing capital are to safeguard the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern in order to 
provide returns for shareholders and benefits for other stakeholders. Consistent with others in the industry and of its size, the  
Group believes that an optimum capital structure is currently achieved entirely through equity and with no net debt. Total equity  
at 31 December 2009 was £23,508,000 (2008: £20,054,000).
In order to maintain or adjust the capital structure, the Group may adjust the amount of dividends paid to shareholders, return 
capital to shareholders, issue new shares or raise future funds through debt. Patsystems Plc

4. Segmental Analysis
The Chief Operating Decision Maker is the Board of Directors. The Board reviews the Company’s internal reporting in order to assess 
performance of the business. Management has determined the operating segments based on the reports reviewed by the Board. 
The Board considers the business from a geographic perspective, monitoring performance by Europe, America and Asia Pacific.
The Group operates in one product line, that of the supply of software to financial institutions.
The Board assesses the performance of the business based on a measure of adjusted profit. Adjusted profit is defined as ‘profit 
before tax after adjusting for share option costs, marking-to-market of derivatives used to hedge cash flows and amortisation of 
intangibles other than internally developed software.’ A reconciliation of adjusted profit to profit before tax is detailed below:

The amounts provided to management with respect to total assets and total liabilities are measured in a manner consistent with 
that of the financial statements. The assets are allocated based on the operations of the segment and the physical location of the 
asset and the liabilities are allocated based on the operations of the segment.
The total of non-current assets other than deferred tax assets located in Europe is £7,428,000 (2008: £7,654,000), and the total of 
these non-current assets located in other regions is £264,000 (2008: £159,000).
Revenue from two customers accounts for more than 10% of total revenue, with revenue of £3,574,000 and £2,560,000 
respectively (2008: £3,601,000 and £3,758,000). These revenues are attributable to all segments.

in their respective territories. A deferred tax asset amounting to £155,831 (2008: £165,000) has not been recognised in respect of 
these losses as their future recovery is uncertain.
9. Parent Company Accounts 
The Parent Company accounts are set out in pages 53 to 60.
10. Earnings Per Ordinary Share
In accordance with IAS 33, the calculation of earnings per ordinary share is based upon:
  
(a) Basic Earnings Per Share  
Basic earnings per share is calculated by dividing the earnings attributable to ordinary shareholders by the weighted average number 
of ordinary shares in issue during the year:
      2009  2008
Profit for the year attributable to equity holders of the Company     £3,362,000  £616,000
Weighted average number of shares      180,628,990  178,982,340
Basic earnings per share      1.9p  0.3p
(b) Diluted Earnings Per Share
Diluted earnings per share is calculated by adjusting the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding to assume 
conversions of all dilutive potential ordinary shares. 
The Group has one category of dilutive potential ordinary shares: share options.
For share options a calculation is performed to determine the number of shares that could have been acquired at fair value 
(determined as the average annual market price of the Group’s shares) based on the monetary value of the subscription rights 
attached to the outstanding options. 
The number of shares calculated above is compared with the number of shares that would have been issued assuming the exercise 
of the share options. Patsystems Plc

Impairment Review
The recoverable amount for the cash generating unit has been measured based on a value in use calculation. The calculations use 
pre-tax profits based on budgets approved by management for the year 2010. Cash flows beyond this are based on a growth rate 
of 2.25%. A pre-tax discount rate of 10% has been applied to the calculations.
As the value in use is greater than the carrying value there is no impairment in the period and the carrying value of goodwill 
represents the excess of the cost of acquisition over the fair value of the Group’s share of the net identifiable assets of the acquired 
subsidiary at the date of acquisition.

of £760,000 (2008: £882,000) were past due but not impaired. These relate to a number of independent customers for whom 
there is no indication of financial difficulties or recent history of default. The Group is in contact with these customers and obtained 
assurances from which it believes that the amounts receivable will be collected in full with no additional cost to the Group.
Provisions for the portion of individually impaired trade receivables assessed to be irrecoverable at 31 December 2009 totalled 
£107,000 (2008: £134,000). These relate to customers where there are indications of financial difficulties or disputes that are 
unlikely to be resolved without further costs to the Group.

Note i: These options were granted under a special award of Part B (Inland Revenue Unapproved) of the Patsystems Plc 2003 Share 
Option Scheme. These options were exercised on 17 March 2009.
The weighted average fair value per share at the measurement date of options granted during the year was nil p (2008: nil p).
The weighted average share price at the date of grant of options granted during the year was nil p (2008: nil p). 
For the options that were exercised during the year, the weighted average share price at the date of exercise was 21p (2008: 23p).
The weighted average remaining contractual life of options outstanding at the year end is 5.7 years (2008: 6.7 years).
The total fair value that was charged to the income statement in relation to the share options was £261,000 (2008: £329,000), all of 
which related to equity settled share based payment transactions.
The fair values of the options have been calculated using the Binomial Model. The model takes into account the following factors in 
determining the fair value of an option:
(a) Share Price and Exercise Price 
Share prices are closing share prices as at the date of grant. Exercise prices are listed in the above schedule.
(b) Expected Term of the Options
It is assumed that the expected life of the options under consideration is five years. 
(c) Volatility
Volatility of the Company’s share price has been calculated as the annualised standard deviation of daily continuously compounded 
returns on the Company’s stock, derived from the Company’s historical share prices, adjusted for splits, over five years back from 
each date of grant.
(d) Risk-Free Interest Rate
The risk-free rates of interest are assumed to be the yield to maturity on a UK Gilt Strip with the term to maturity equal to the 
expected life of the option. 
(e) Dividends
The valuations take account of the expected future dividend yield at the date of each grant.
The table below sets out the volatilities, risk-free interest rates and dividend yields applied in each valuation:

Notes to the Financial Statements
1. Accounting Policies
The financial statements have been prepared on the historical cost basis of accounting and in accordance with applicable accounting 
standards in the United Kingdom. 
The principal accounting policies applied in the preparation of these financial statements are set out below. These policies have been 
consistently applied to all the years presented, unless otherwise stated.
1.1 Investments 
Investments in subsidiaries are stated at cost less any provision for impairment. Where an acquisition satisfies the provisions of 
sections 611 to 616 of the Companies Act 2006, merger relief is available and the investment is stated at nominal value of shares 
issued plus the value of any other consideration.
1.2 Operating Leases
Costs in respect of operating leases are charged to the Profit and Loss Account on a straight line basis over the lease term. 
1.3 Current and Deferred Income Taxes
The current income tax charge is calculated on the basis of the tax laws enacted or substantively enacted at the Balance Sheet date. 
Management periodically evaluates positions taken in tax returns with respect to situations in which applicable tax regulations are 
subject to interpretation and establishes provisions where appropriate on the basis of amounts expected to be paid to the tax 
authorities.
Deferred taxation is recognised in respect of timing differences that have originated but not reversed at the Balance Sheet date, 
where transactions or events that result in an obligation to pay more tax in the future or a right to pay less tax in the future have 
occurred at the Balance Sheet date.
A net deferred tax asset is regarded as recoverable and therefore recognised only when, on the basis of all available evidence, it can 
be regarded as more likely than not that there will be sufficient taxable profits to utilise carried forward tax losses and against which 
the reversal of underlying timing differences can be deducted.
Deferred tax is measured at the average tax rates that are expected to apply in the periods in which the timing differences are 
expected to reverse based on tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the Balance Sheet date. 
Deferred tax is measured on a non-discounted basis.
1.4 Related Party Transactions
Financial Reporting Standard (‘FRS’) 8, ‘Related Party Transactions’, requires the disclosure of the details of material transactions 
between the reporting entity and related parties. The Company has taken advantage of exemptions under FRS 8 not to disclose 
transactions between Group companies.
1.5 Share Based Payments
The Group operates two share options schemes; the Enterprise Management Incentive Scheme and the 2003 Share Option Scheme 
(Inland Revenue unapproved). 
The fair value of options is recognised as an employee benefit expense with a corresponding increase in reserves over the vesting 
period. The proceeds received net of any directly attributable transaction costs are credited to share capital (nominal value) and 
share premium when the options are exercised. 
1.6 Cash Flow Statement 
The Company is the Parent Company of the Patsystems Plc Group and is included in the consolidated financial statements of 
Patsystems Plc. Consequently, the Company has taken advantage of the exemption from preparing a cash flow statement under the 
terms of Financial Reporting Standard 1 (revised 1996).
1.7 Dividend Distributions
Final dividend distributions to the Company’s shareholders are recognised as liabilities in the Company’s financial statements in the 
period in which the dividends are approved by the Company’s shareholders. Interim dividend distributions to the Company’s 
shareholders are recognised as liabilities in the Company’s financial statements when paid. Patsystems Plc

The Parent Company does not employ any Directors or employees.
3. Profit and Loss Account 
The profit for the year dealt with in the accounts of the Company was £799,000 (2008: £1,196,000).
The Directors have taken advantage of the exemption available under section 408 of the Companies Act 2006, and have not 
presented a Profit and Loss Account for the Company alone.

Note i: These options were granted under a special award of Part B (Inland Revenue Unapproved) of the Patsystems Plc 2003 Share 
Option Scheme. These options were exercised on 17 March 2009.
The weighted average fair value per share at the measurement date of options granted during the year was nil p (2008: nil p).
The weighted average share price at the date of grant of options granted during the year was nil p (2008: nil p). 
For the options that were exercised during the year, the weighted average share price at the date of exercise was 21p (2008: 23p).
The weighted average remaining contractual life of options outstanding at the year end is 5.7 years (2008: 6.7 years)
The total fair value that was charged to the income statement in relation to the share options was £261,000 (2008: £329,000), all of 
which related to equity settled share based payment transactions.
The fair values of the options have been calculated using the Binomial Model. The model takes into account the following factors in 
determining the fair value of an option:
(a) Share Price and Exercise Price 
Share prices are closing share prices as at the date of grant. Exercise prices are listed in the above schedule.
(b) Expected Term of the Options
It is assumed that the expected life of the options under consideration is five years. 
(c) Volatility
Volatility of the Company’s share price has been calculated as the annualised standard deviation of daily continuously compounded 
returns on the Company’s stock, derived from the Company’s historical share prices, adjusted for splits, over five years back from 
each date of grant.
(d) Risk-Free Interest Rate
The risk-free rates of interest are assumed to be the yield to maturity on a UK Gilt Strip with the term to maturity equal to the 
expected life of the option. 
(e) Dividends
The valuations take account of the expected future dividend yield at the date of each grant.
The table below sets out the volatilities, risk-free interest rates and dividend yields applied in each valuation:

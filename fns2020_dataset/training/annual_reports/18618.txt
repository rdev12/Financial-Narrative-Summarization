INVESTMENT CASE
OUR OVERALL VISION IS TO 
BUILD THE BEST PUBS AND 
BEER BUSINESS IN THE UK
We aim to create a clear industry leader that is the first choice for employees, 
for customers who want to spend their discretionary income on eating and 
drinking out, and for shareholders who want to invest in the leisure sector.
Within this, our objective is to offer our customers memorable experiences 
through the delivery of outstanding value, exceptional service and unbeatable 
quality across our businesses, differentiated by investment in innovation 
and in our people.
ALIGNED WITH 
CONSUMER TRENDS
We constantly develop our Retail offer to ensure we remain 
relevant in an environment of increasing consumer choice 
and awareness, and we have identified a number of ongoing 
and emerging consumer trends.
A HIGH QUALITY, 
WELL-POSITIONED ESTATE
As at 3 May 2015 we ran 1,909 managed and tenanted pubs. 
57% of our estate is situated in the South-east and East, which 
has proved beneficial throughout the economic recovery. 
We own the freehold title on 94% of our estate. This gives 
us freedom to renovate our pubs and removes the ongoing 
requirement to use a proportion of the cash that we generate 
to pay rent. We believe that these benefits, among others, 
outweigh the initial capital outlay associated with 
purchasing the freehold title of a pub.

CHAIRMAN’S STATEMENT
Results
In the year, total revenue was £1,315.3m, up 3.0%
1
 and another record 
figure for the company. The operating profit before exceptional items 
was down 1.7% to £256.2m and profit before tax and exceptional items 
(PBTE) was down 0.8%, each being affected by lower LFL sales growth 
and the impact of the disposal of 275 pubs to Hawthorn Leisure. 
Our adjusted earnings per share were up 1.3% to 61.0p. After making 
allowance for the disposal of the pubs, the retained business grew 
PBTE by 6.9% and adjusted earnings per share by 9.2%. 
Dividend
Following a year of strong underlying growth for the company, the 
board has recommended a final dividend of 21.8p per share, up 4.8% 
on last year. This takes the total dividend for the year to 29.75p per share, 
up 4.8%, continuing our long track record of dividend growth. 
The final dividend is expected to be paid on 14 September 2015 to those 
shareholders on the register at the close of business on 14 August 2015.
Acquisitions
On 23 June, after the year end, we completed the acquisition of 
Spirit Pub Company plc, the largest acquisition in the company’s 
history. This added 791 retail sites and 416 tenanted and leased sites 
to our pub estate. During the year, we added 32 sites to our retail estate 
at a total cost of £75.9m, leaving us with 1,060 sites at the year end.
Disposals
During the year, we sold 314 non-core sites for a total of £94.1m, 
including the sale to Hawthorn Leisure. The 39 disposals outside 
of the Hawthorn Leisure transaction realised a sale value of £18.5m. 
Board
Sadly, Matthew Fearn, our chief financial officer, had to leave us in 
September 2014 because of his ill health. In his place, we appointed 
Kirk Davis, who was formerly the finance director at JD Wetherspoon plc. 
We welcomed him onto our board as chief financial officer on 
3 November 2014. 
In July 2014, Rob Rowley joined our board as a non-executive 
director. He was formerly at Reuters Group plc, where he held 
various roles including that of finance director, and will be taking 
the chairmanship of the audit committee from Ian Durant next year.
People
I would like to thank everyone who has worked for Greene King 
over the course of the year, whether it be those who work in our 
managed pub business, our tenanted and leased pub business or our 
beer business. Wherever you are in the company, or in the country, 
your efforts and your achievements are, as always, highly valued 
and appreciated. 
On the most recent note of all, I would like to welcome all of the Spirit 
employees. We look forward to working with you, sharing ideas and 
making the most of our joint opportunity to forge a successful 
future together.

Performance summary
It has been another record year for Greene King with Retail revenue 
exceeding £1bn for the first time and underlying growth in Pub Partners 
and Brewing & Brands. We have made good financial and strategic 
progress and completed a successful five-year strategic plan, 
culminating in the disposal of over 300 non-core sites in the year 
and, after the year end, the acquisition of Spirit Pub Company. 
We grew total revenue by 3.0%
1
, while the retained business, excluding 
non-core pub disposals, achieved 5.0% growth. Operating profit was 
1.7% lower than last year although it was up 3.8% on a retained business 
basis. The operating margin on a retained business basis fell 20bps 
to 19.4%, following a significant recovery in the second half. 
Adjusted earnings per share were up 1.3% and up 9.2% on a retained 
business basis. As a result of this continued strong underlying growth, 
the board has recommended an increase of 4.8% in the dividend 
per share. 
Although underlying retail growth was lower than anticipated at 
the start of the year, we increased our ROCE to 9.3%, ahead of WACC.
We also made significant progress in key operational metrics, including 
a 12.3%pt increase in our Retail Net Promoter Scores (NPS) and a 13.4% 
reduction in Retail team turnover. 
Market overview
While economic indicators generally continued to improve throughout 
the year, the underlying trends within the sector slowed down as 
customers diverted discretionary spending towards ‘bigger ticket 
items’. However, we are confident that our continued investment 
in the business will feed through into stronger underlying growth 
going forward, supported by ongoing improvements in consumer 
confidence and disposable income. 
With 62%
3
 of UK leisure spending, the eating and drinking out 
markets dominate the UK leisure market. Within the eating out market, 
27% of spend comes from pubs and bars with spend in branded pubs 
and bars forecasted to be 14% in 2015, up from 11% in 2010. We believe 
pubs and bars, and particularly branded pubs and bars, will continue 
to play a significant role within the UK leisure market. 
Now that the Small Business, Enterprise and Employment Bill has 
become law, we will continue to work closely with the Government 
to make sure that important secondary legislation is balanced, does 
not add unnecessary ‘red tape’ and encourages continued investment 
in the tenanted and leased sector.
Our Scottish business suffered in the year from the introduction of 
a lower drink-driving limit just before Christmas. We have mitigated 
the impact as much as we can through a number of initiatives. 
However, the lower limit has changed consumer behaviour towards 
drinking out in Scotland and we expect to see continued LFL sales 
weakness, at least in the first full year following its introduction.

Corporate governance Strategic report Financial statements Shareholder information
Strategy update
Our five-year strategic plan to improve growth and returns to 
our shareholders has been successful, helping to drive significant 
change in the business and better positioning Greene King for 
sustainable long-term growth. During the last five years, we have:
1.  Expanded our Retail estate by 19.4% and improved average 
EBITDA per pub by 24%. Since 2010, we have added 172 sites to 
our retail estate, including 32 sites this year, ending the year on 
1,060 pubs, restaurants and hotels. The acquisitions of Cloverleaf, 
RealPubs and Capital Pubs accelerated our progress in Retail 
and, overall, average EBITDA per pub improved 24% over the 
five years. The return on the cash we invested during the period 
in new sites was 15.1%, ahead of WACC, and generating 
shareholder value. 
2.  Reduced our Pub Partners estate by 46% and improved 
average EBITDA per pub by 33%. Over the five years, we sold or 
transferred 735 tenanted and leased sites including 310 this year, 
taking us significantly ahead of our initial target of 1,200 sites. 
Since 2010, average EBITDA per pub has risen by 33% to £69.9k. 
3.  Continued our cask ale leadership position through 
consistent and industry-leading brand investment. Since 
2010, OBV grew 19.7% against an ale market that declined 12.6%. 
This outperformance was driven by investment and innovation in 
our industry-leading brand portfolio. Over the five years, we increased 
our volume share of the UK ale market by 1.2%pts to 10.0%
1
. 
Having successfully delivered on our five-year plan, our immediate 
focus looking forward is to manage the twin challenges of delivering 
sustainable performance improvements in Greene King Retail, 
while successfully integrating Spirit Pub Company to create a clear 
industry leader. 
We have worked hard this year to drive improvements in value, 
service and quality across Retail, but we are clear that more needs 
to be done if we are to deliver positively memorable experiences 
to more savvy and connected customers, in an increasingly 
competitive marketplace.
Linked to the core business challenge is the opportunity that the 
acquisition of Spirit brings. We completed the acquisition on 23 June, 
following the CMA’s formal acceptance of our undertaking to sell 
16 pubs, thereby creating the UK’s leading managed pub company. 
With a combined estate of 3,100 pubs, restaurants and hotels, 
including over 1,000 in London and the South-east, we are well 
positioned to deliver long-term growth. 
We expect to generate at least £30m of cost synergies and we 
anticipate there being further opportunities for value creation. 
The greater the benefits we realise, the more we will seek to invest 
in key areas of the combined business such as people, IT and marketing, 
thereby helping to further strengthen the core Retail business. 
Current trading and outlook
We have seen a steady start to the new financial year. In the first 
eight weeks, Retail LFL sales were up 0.6%, LFL net income in Pub 
Partners was up 1.2% and OBV in Brewing & Brands was down 3.7%, 
against tough comparatives and a year-on-year delay in the timing 
of export sales. The new drink-driving regulations in Scotland reduced 
Retail LFLs by 50bps during the period. For the same eight-week 
period, managed LFL sales at Spirit were up 0.8%.
While consumer spending on eating and drinking out is improving, 
spending on big ticket items has been the main beneficiary of the 
return to real income growth so far. In this environment, we will 
continue to focus on improving customer experiences in order 
to drive sustainable growth across the core business. 
We are looking forward to integrating Spirit and to building the 
leading pub hospitality company in the UK, combining the best 
people, brands and processes from both businesses. We have only 
recently completed the acquisition, but our early analysis of the 
business is encouraging and we see a number of exciting 
opportunities for the combined business. 
We are confident of delivering another year of financial 
and strategic progress for our shareholders.

KEY BUSINESS DRIVERS
Our retail business is split into two divisions – our more 
food-focused Destination Pubs and Restaurants division 
(466 sites) and our more community-focused Local Pubs 
division (594 sites). 
The success of our Retail business is driven by our 
customers’ desire to eat and drink outside of their homes 
and is specifically determined by the number of customers 
we attract and the amount that they spend with us.
Our principal revenue streams are food and drink available 
for consumption on our premises. We gain further revenue 
from our accommodation offer at some sites, and a number 
of our sites have gaming machines.
OPER ATIONAL PRIORITIES
 – Consistently providing outstanding value, exceptional 
service and unbeatable quality to our customers 
 – Constantly innovating to ensure that we offer our 
customers differentiated and compelling experiences 
 – Selectively and strategically expanding our estate
 – Ongoing training of our teams, who are crucial 
to our Retail success
RETAIL
Our Pub Partners business offers entrepreneurs the 
opportunity to operate our pubs in England and Scotland.
We offer a flexible range of agreements, for tenanted pubs, 
leased pubs and franchised pubs.
Revenue in our Pub Partners business is principally achieved 
through the supply of beer and other drinks to our licensees 
and the rent that they pay us to have access to the pub and 
our support. We also derive a small portion of revenue 
from gaming machines.
OPER ATIONAL PRIORITIES
 – Continuing to recruit and retain quality licensees
 – The offer of a flexible and attractive range of agreements 
to existing and future licensees
 – Ongoing training of our people to offer industry-leading 
support to our licensees
 – Selective and strategic pub disposals to ensure we 
maintain an attractive and cash-generative estate
PUB PARTNERS
Our Brewing & Brands division operates two breweries, 
one in Bury St Edmunds and the other in Dunbar.
We generate revenue in our Brewing & Brands business from 
the sale and distribution of ales produced by us in our own 
breweries, and from the sale and distribution of drinks (both 
alcoholic and non-alcoholic) produced by third parties.
As well as to our internal customers in the other divisions, 
we also sell our ales to other pub companies and to individual 
free trade customers. A further important revenue stream is 
the sale of our own-brewed ales to supermarkets and other 
retail outlets and, increasingly, in the export market.
OPER ATIONAL PRIORITIES
 – Evolving our business model to pursue channels of growth 
within the sector such as the take-home and export markets
 – Maximising our market share and cash generation in markets 
such as the on-trade by ensuring we have an exciting and 
appealing portfolio of own-brewed brands
 – Rigorously training and investing in our people to deliver 
consistently high levels of service and quality

UK MARKET: LFL GROWTH & 
CONTRIBUTION FROM NEW SPACE 
(ROLLING MAT)
BEER DUTY (£ PER 1% ABV/HL)
1
Introduction
The key markets in which we operate are the UK drinking out, 
eating out and staying out markets. We aim to grow our share of 
these markets by utilising our industry-leading brands, our high 
quality asset base and our talented teams to offer customers 
unrivalled value, service and quality. 
Over the last 12 months, while sector LFL sales growth has been 
more subdued than in previous years within Greene King Retail, 
our largest and fastest growing business, we have successfully 
outperformed the total market and grown total sales by 5.9%. LFL 
beer volumes in Pub Partners, our tenanted, leased and franchised 
division, have also outperformed the UK on-trade beer market, while 
in our Brewing & Brands business own-brewed volumes of our core 
ale brands have continued to outperform the total UK ale market.
Environmental analysis
Political
The recent election result has provided more certainty as to the 
direction of policy towards the pub industry which is to be welcomed. 
In the last 12 months, under a coalition Government and with 
a devolved Scottish parliament, the pub industry had more than 
its fair share of political involvement. 
While we were pleased to see a third beer duty cut in three years at 
the pre-election budget, we continue to believe that the statutory code 
for pub companies, brought in within the Small Business, Enterprise 
and Employment Act, is unnecessary and has the potential for material, 
unintended consequences for the wider pub industry. Although we 
believe we will be able to mitigate the potential financial impact of 
the market rent only (MRO) option, essentially an option for licensees 
to go free of their beer tie, the introduction of this option will create 
significant additional red tape for the ultimate benefit of just a small 
number of licensees across the UK. 
The introduction of a lower drink driving limit in Scotland has 
changed consumer behaviour in that localised market. The new 
lower limit of 50mg of alcohol was brought in without any 
consultation and has had a significantly negative impact on pub 
sales across Scotland, with rural pubs in small communities 
most affected. 
We maintain our support for an alcohol minimum unit price (MUP). 
We believe MUP, alongside other measures such as improved 
alcohol education, can be a highly effective measure in reducing 
irresponsible retailing and consuming of alcohol, therefore helping 
to reduce the costs to society of rising alcohol-related illness 
and crime. 
Economic
The macro-economic backdrop continued to improve during the 
year, with further GDP growth and consumers finally seeing a 
return to real income growth driven by both improving employment 
and slowing inflation. Consumer confidence trends have been 
equally positive.
There has been a lag in these positive indicators feeding through 
to sustainable increases in consumer spend in the UK eating and 
drinking out market, with spend on bigger ticket items the clear 
beneficiary of the economic recovery to date. Due to regional 
variances in employment levels and exposure to slowing inflation, 
not all consumers have enjoyed a similar return to real income 
growth as demonstrated by the continued outperformance 
of the London market. 
Nevertheless, customers continue to treat themselves and we have 
traded well over key events during the year. We continue to evolve 
and tailor our customer-focused strategy to ensure that we capture 
any incremental spend in our markets and that our portfolio of 
brands and concepts is well positioned as the effects of real income 
growth is increasingly felt by our consumers.

Social
Alcohol consumption in the UK continues to decline with changes 
in lifestyle including a greater focus on health a contributory factor. 
However, 2014 was a positive year for beer sales, with total sales 
rising 0.8% in 2014 following nine years of decline
1
 and skewed to 
the off-trade, where total beer sales grew by 3.2% compared to the 
on-trade where total beer sales declined by 1.3%
1
. Beer sales have 
undoubtedly been helped by three years of beer duty cuts and further 
supported by the increasing popularity of craft beer, as demonstrated 
by the 6.4% increase in the premium market in the year encompassing 
increases in both the on and the off-trade channels
1
.
The UK eating out market continues to grow with increases in both 
the proportion of adults eating out of home and the frequency with 
which they do so. In Q4 2014 84% of adults said that they visited pubs 
for food
2
. Hectic lifestyles and the desire to treat themselves or 
others are key drivers of this trend and consumers are increasingly 
interested in informal dining – great value food and drink – across 
all day parts.
The UK pub market continues to develop in order to meet these 
customer-led trends. For example, many pubs have improved their 
coffee offer and are targeting breakfast sales as well as the more 
traditional out-of-home dining occasions. In many cases, the distinction 
between a pub and a restaurant or casual dining outlet is diminishing 
and, more generally, the various sub-sectors in the UK eating-out 
market are less distinct. Managed and branded pubs are the key 
drivers of the evolution of the pub sector and between 2012 and 
2015 are forecast to grow turnover at an average annual rate of 3.9% 
compared with the forecast total pub market growth of 1.1%
2
.
The UK provincial staying out market enjoyed a strong year in 2014 
benefiting from the economic recovery and a buoyant travel market. 
RevPAR (revenue per available room) grew at 7% in the provinces, 
outperforming the London staying out market, and driven by increases 
in both occupancy and the average daily rate
3
. The 2015 outlook for 
the UK staying out market is positive. Ongoing improvements in both 
the UK and international economies are anticipated to feed through 
to further growth in both business and leisure related travel in 2015, 
with contributions from inbound visitors and domestic ‘staycations’. 
Greene King performance
We continue to grow our market share in our core markets of eating 
out, drinking out and staying out. Over the course of our five-year 
strategy plan we are pleased to have increased our market share of the 
UK branded and managed pub market from 10.1% to 11.3% by turnover, 
while maintaining our market share by number of sites at 12%. 
In the staying-out market we have increased our share by turnover 
by ten basis points to 0.2%, led by our Old English Inns portfolio.
In total we have added 172 sites to our Retail business over the last 
five years aided by acquisitions such as Cloverleaf, Real Pubs and 
Capital Pubs. These acquisitions have performed well and together 
have achieved returns broadly in line with initial plans in addition 
to increasing our exposure to the buoyant London market.

KEY PERFORMANCE INDICATORS
Further strategic and operational progress helped to deliver another 
year of growth in Greene King Retail. Total Retail revenue grew by 5.9%, 
outperforming the market
2
, which grew by 4.9% over a comparable 
period. LFL sales growth was 0.4%. LFL sales were affected by a 
disappointing World Cup in the first half, tougher comparatives in 
the second half and the impact of the new drink driving legislation 
in Scotland from December. 
Room sales achieved the best LFL sales growth while LFL sales in 
drink and food performed broadly similarly. Our best performing 
brands and formats were Metropolitan, our premium London estate, 
Farmhouse Inns, our growing carvery brand, core Local pubs and OEI.
We exceeded £1bn of total Retail revenue for the first time and this 
was up 5.9%, or £55.9m, on the previous year. Both Retail divisions, 
Local Pubs and Destination Pubs, enjoyed growth in the year and 
the average weekly sales per pub across Retail grew 2.3% to £18,100. 
Operating profit was up 3.6% to £190.8m while the operating margin 
was down 40bps, having been down 80bps in the first half. The margin 
decline was due to the dilutive effect of lower sales growth and 
increased labour investment, partly offset by cost savings and 
a more benign cost environment. 
Our ongoing progress in Retail is driven by a number of key factors, 
all predicated on putting customers at the heart of our business, 
offering them experiences to remember and ensuring their time 
and money are well spent. 
1.  Managing constant change in customer perceptions 
of value, service and quality
In terms of value, we re-launched and expanded our known value 
item (KVI) strategy across Hungry Horse, Meet & Eat and Flame Grill 
offering customers enhanced value at 80% more sites than the previous 
year. In OEI, both leisure and corporate customers were able to take 
advantage of our great-value breaks, while in Farmhouse Inns we 
introduced a ‘Carvery Baps’ lunch offer for £3.95 and a new 
breakfast menu with ‘generosity’ at its core. 
On service, initiatives such as enhanced menu training programmes 
and menu simplification helped to improve our average Net Promoter 
Scores by 12.3%. In Farmhouse Inns, we reconfigured the carvery 
layout to reduce queue times by over 60%, while in Hungry Horse 
we introduced pagers to proactively manage peak trading 
customer requirements. 
On quality, we expanded the fresh supply chain in our Premium 
Locals format, which was subsequently recognised with the award 
of ‘best pub menu’ by Restaurant Magazine, while we were proud 
to see Flame Grill announced as the winner of the National Fish 
and Chip Awards in 2015.

OPERATIONAL REVIEW CONTINUED
2. Staying close to our customers
We have identified a number of ongoing and emerging consumer trends 
including all-day eating out and inter-generational eating out occasions.
Daytime Retail sales grew 8% following an expansion of the 
breakfast offer in Hungry Horse, the introduction of ‘Afternoon Tea’ 
in Farmhouse Inns, new lighter snacks such as chocolate-coated 
popcorn and a salt-beef sandwich, and a new weekend brunch offer 
in Loch Fyne Seafood & Grill, which recognises the brand’s Scottish 
heritage by including meals such as ‘the full Scottish’, and has led 
to a 76% increase in weekly sales from 7.00am to 11.00am. 
We continue to promote family dining in our sites, with the roll-out 
of our ‘Golden Years’ offers to further brands across the estate and 
the introduction of sharing tables and zones designed to enhance 
sharing occasions in selected new sites. We also introduced a new 
ice cream offer for families in Farmhouse Inns to complement 
our successful ‘Cakeaway’ offer. 
3. Expanding our digital platform 
For the increasingly connected consumer, we further extended our 
digital capability, getting closer to our customers by increasing the 
channels through which we engage with them. Digital initiatives 
included the ‘Golden Ticket’ data capture project in Hungry Horse, 
with 115,000 customers signing up through a monthly prize draw 
to win £100 golden tickets, and the development of our OEI 
accommodation website to engage more customers on the move. 
We also introduced an app-based platform to capture live feedback 
from field-based employees. Overall, traffic to our websites grew 
by 20%, the number of loyalty card holders grew by 17% 
and the number of Facebook followers grew by 64%.
4.  Growing our branded retail presence in the eating 
and drinking out markets
All our pubs are branded, utilising at least one of the pub name, 
a format or retail brand name, or Greene King. We are focused on 
growing our retail branding and at the year end we had 763 sites 
with a retail brand or format, against 710 12 months earlier. Our 
leading brands and formats by number of sites are Hungry Horse, 
with 241 sites at the year end, Meet & Eat (182 sites) and OEI 
(115 sites). The brands receiving the most expansion investment 
are Hungry Horse and Farmhouse Inns. 
5.  Employing and developing the best-trained and most 
motivated people in the sector 
Our people are fundamental to the success of our business and we 
continued to grow our own talent with the launch of initiatives such 
as a bespoke apprenticeship scheme in Loch Fyne Seafood & Grill 
and the introduction of a coffee diploma for all team members in 
Hungry Horse. The impact of our people initiatives is evident in a 
13.4% reduction in team turnover across Retail and improvements 
across our annual employee engagement survey. Now that we have 
completed the acquisition of Spirit, we employ over 40,000 people, 
half of whom are under 25. We take the responsibility of employing 
and developing so many young people seriously and will look 
to further increase investment in our people going forward. 
6. Continuing industry-leading asset investment 
We lead the industry in terms of investing in our existing estate and 
additions to our estate. Our investment in repairing, maintaining and 
improving the quality of our existing estate rose 5.5% to £79.3m, 
while we opened 26 sites and transferred in six sites from Pub Partners 
in the year helping to take the estate to 1,060 sites at the year end. 
We spent £75.9m on acquiring and developing these sites. Our expansion 
programme slowed in the year as resources were diverted to important 
M&A activity, while, following the acquisition of Spirit’s 1,207 sites, 
we expect to open around 15 additional high quality new sites in the 
2016 financial year. We also expect to sell a similar number of non-core 
Retail sites, on top of the agreed CMA disposals.

Strategic report
OPERATIONAL REVIEW CONTINUED
Pub Partners’ strategy is to be the preferred partner to the best operators, 
sharing sustainable profit growth, enabled by industry-leading 
business support and a high quality estate. 
Pub Partners traded ahead of our expectations in the year, delivering 
LFL net income growth of 3.5% and average EBITDA per pub 
growth of 15.5%.
Revenue was down 16.9% on last year following the sale of 275 
non-core pubs to Hawthorn Leisure in May 2014, but level with last 
year on a retained basis. The average size of the estate fell 27.4% and 
average revenue per pub increased 14.3%. EBITDA was £61.6m, down 
16.2%, but up 3.9% on a retained basis. The acceleration of our disposal 
strategy also impacted operating profit although the margin and 
ROCE improved versus last year, reflecting the higher quality of the 
remaining Pub Partners estate and the strong trading performance.
In order to be the preferred partner to the best operators, we need 
the best pubs. In total, we sold 310 pubs in the year and we transferred 
six sites to Retail where we considered we would generate sufficient 
incremental profit to justify the transfer. We also continued to invest 
in our retained estate, spending £18.9m in total over the year. 
Supporting our partner ambitions, we continue to develop the strength 
of our internal team and the quality and reach of our recruitment 
programme to attract and retain the best operators. Over 30% of 
attendees to our quarterly open days became licensees with us and we 
have leveraged the digital expertise in other parts of the Greene King 
business to successfully engage with potential applicants through 
targeted social media campaigns. We have increased investment in 
our licensed training programmes, including hosting 16 regional 
social media training events and, within our internal team, over 
two thirds of our business development managers have now attended 
diploma or masters courses at Birmingham City University. We were 
proud to see a member of the Pub Partners team crowned National 
BDM of the Year by the ALMR, the second successive year that we 
have achieved this recognition.
We provide a range of agreements to potential licensee partners, 
including short-term tenancies, longer leases, Local Hero, our 
franchise-style agreement with a retail concept built around local 
provenance, and Meet & Eat, a fully accredited turnkey franchise 
agreement. We increased the number of franchise and franchise-style 
agreements by 26% to 58. 
We further developed our online communications platform and 
launched a bi-monthly ‘Innsight’ magazine, which is written in 
partnership with licensees for licensees and, more recently, we launched 
the ‘Flying Start Project’ designed to enhance licensee experience in 
the build-up to, and during, their first 100 days as our business partners.
All of these initiatives led to a further increase in average licensee 
tenure, which, at the end of the year, stood at five years and seven 
months. We also saw continued low levels of licensee debt and the 
number of temporary agreements remained at just 12 at the year end.
Looking ahead, the acquisition of Spirit will further improve the 
quality of our Pub Partners estate, as we add 416 pubs at an average 
EBITDA per pub of £77k.

Strategic report
OPERATIONAL REVIEW CONTINUED
BREWING & BRANDS CONTINUED
Brewing & Brands’ strategy is to grow market share through 
an appealing portfolio of core brands, complemented by an 
innovative range of craft and seasonal ales. This growth is 
enhanced by sector-leading investment in sales and marketing 
and, by simultaneously running an efficient cost base, maximising 
cash generation for the group.
Significant progress was made in the year. OBV was up 4.2% in a UK 
ale market down 1.2% in the 12 months to April 2015
1
, with our share 
rising 40bps to 10.0%
1
. We remain the UK’s leading cask ale brewer. 
Revenue grew by 3.9% to £192.7m, while operating profit was 0.1% 
lower at £29.8m, reflecting the sale of 275 leased and tenanted pubs 
to Hawthorn Leisure at the beginning of the year. Excluding the 
impact of disposals, operating profit was up 4.4% to £29.3m. 
The ‘Hen’ brand family had another successful year with volume 
growth of over 16%, outperforming the UK premium ale market 
which grew 6.5%
1
. Old Speckled Hen remains the number one 
premium ale brand in Great Britain
2
 and has seen its volume 
almost quadruple since we acquired it in 1999.
Export enjoyed a record year driven by strong sales in Russia, 
supplemented by the US and Europe. Volumes in the take home 
channel were also up significantly and Greene King is now the leading 
British-owned brewer in multiple grocers
3
. 
Key innovation in the year comprised the Greene King IPA brand 
relaunch with an accompanying quality assurance programme, 
designed to further engage with our trade customers and to enhance 
point-of-sale quality. We continued our focus on new product 
development and during the year we launched East Coast IPA, 
an American influenced keg beer, and the limited edition 
‘Old Nutty Hen’. 
Other exciting developments included winning the exclusive rights 
to the Goose Island beer range in England and Wales, including the 
award-winning 312 Urban Wheat brand, and Greene King IPA 
winning a gold award at the 2015 Monde awards.

Total revenue grew to £1,315.3m, an increase of 3.0%

. The biggest 
driver of growth continues to be our Retail business, where revenue 
grew by 5.9% and average revenue per site rose 2.4%. Retail now 
accounts for 76% of group revenue. Total revenue in Pub Partners was 
down 16.9%, due primarily to the impact of pub disposals, although 
average revenue per pub increased 14.3%. Brewing & Brands grew 
revenue by 3.9%. On a retained business basis, stripping out the 
impact of disposals, total revenue was up 5.0% to £1,313.0m.
Operating profit before exceptionals was £256.2m, down 1.7% 
on last year, with the operating margin down 90bps to 19.5%. On a 
retained business basis, operating profit rose 3.8% to £254.4m, with 
the operating margin down 20bps to 19.4%. The reduction in the 
retained business operating margin was due to lower retail revenue 
growth and our additional investment in labour. Net interest costs, 
before exceptional items of £87.7m, were 3.4% lower than last year, 
due to strong cash flow management and the impact of disposal 
proceeds. PBTE was £168.5m, a decrease of 0.8%. Adjusted earnings 
per share of 61.0p were up 1.3%, benefiting from the reduction in 
the effective tax rate. Statutory profit before tax was £118.2m, up 
12.4% on a 53 week basis, as a result of the impact of exceptional 
items, summarised below.
Tax
The effective rate of corporation tax (before exceptional items) 
was 21% compared to 23% in the previous year, resulting in a charge 
to operating profits (before exceptional items) of £35.3m. This is in 
line with the standard UK corporation tax rate. 
The group’s business strategy generates revenue, profits and 
employment, all of which deliver substantial tax revenues for the 
UK Government in the form of duties, VAT, income tax and corporation 
tax. In the year, total tax revenues paid and collected by the group 
were £405m (2014: £400m). The group’s tax policy, which has been 
approved by the board, aligns with this strategy and ensures that 
the group fulfils its UK tax responsibilities, while structuring its 
operations in a tax efficient manner. There are a number of open tax 
positions in relation to historical transactions and an estimate of the 
expected total payment relating to these transactions is included 
within the tax creditor of £50.8m (2014: £46.5m).
Pensions 
As at the year end, the group maintained two defined contribution 
schemes, which are open to all new employees. The group’s two 
defined benefit schemes are both closed to new entrants and 
to future accrual.
At the year end, there was an IAS 19 pension deficit of £59.2m, which 
compares to £52.2m at the previous balance sheet date. The movement 
is primarily due to an increase in value of the schemes’ liabilities 
as a consequence of the reduction in the discount rate applied.
Total cash contributions in the period under the schemes’ deficit 
recovery plans were £6.9m.

FINANCIAL REVIEW CONTINUED
Exceptional items 
We recorded a net exceptional charge of £43.9m, consisting of a £43.9m 
charge to operating profit before tax, a £6.4m charge to finance costs 
and a net exceptional tax credit of £6.4m. Full details are set out 
in note five and the principal items are as follows:
1.  An impairment charge of £27.4m (2014: £22.0m) was made against 
the carrying value of a small number of our pubs where specific 
market conditions impacted trading. 
2.  During the year, the group incurred £15.8m in exceptional advisory 
fees in relation to the acquisition of Spirit Pub Company and open 
tax positions. In addition, we incurred £1.5m of exceptional 
employee costs, which included restructuring costs and costs 
associated with changes to key management. 
3.  The exceptional tax credit of £6.4m includes a £7.0m tax credit 
on exceptional items, a deferred tax credit of £2.3m, in respect of 
the licensed estate, a £9.5m income tax charge in respect of prior 
periods and an £6.6m deferred tax credit in respect of prior periods.
Cash flow
Operating cash flows continue to be strong. We generated free cash flow 
(FCF) of £55.7m, which was significantly ahead of our scheduled debt 
repayments of £31.1m. EBITDA was £319.0m, down 1.4%, but from 
13.0% fewer pubs. 
During the year, we disposed of 314 sites as part of our strategy to 
improve the quality of our estate, with the cash proceeds totalling £94.1m. 
We also made good progress with our strategic Retail expansion 
plan, adding 26 new pubs to our Retail estate, investing £73.4m.
Capital expenditure 
We invested in maintaining and developing our core estate, in addition 
to growing the size of our Retail estate. Total expenditure during 
the period was £160.5m.
Capital expenditure on the core estate, including maintenance 
capital, was £84.6m, an increase of £2.3m. In addition, we invested 
£75.9m on our retail expansion, with £20.6m invested in acquiring 
single sites and £55.3m on developing those assets. 
Net debt and treasury
Net debt at the year end was £1,368.7m, a reduction of £66.9m from 
the previous year end, with the key movements being positive FCF 
of £55.7m, disposal proceeds of £94.1m and the continued investment 
in growing our Retail estate, through new sites, of £75.9m.
Our high quality pub estate supports £1,180.7m of securitised bonds 
with amortisation of £31.1m and a weighted average maturity of 12 years.
Our credit metrics remain strong with interest rate hedges in place 
for 96% of the variable rate debt and a blended average cost of debt 
of 6.1%. Fixed charge cover has improved slightly to 2.9x, while 
interest cover remained at 3.0x. Group net debt to EBITDA reduced 
to 4.3x. Our securitised vehicle had a FCF debt service cover ratio 
of 1.5x at the year end, giving 24% headroom.
Following the recent acquisition of Spirit Pub Company, the pro-forma 
net debt of the group is £2.02bn
1
 with net debt to EBITDA at 4.2x

.
Dividend 
The board has recommended a final dividend of 21.8p per share, up 
4.8%. This will be paid on 14 September 2015 to all shareholders on 
the register at the close of business on 14 August 2015.
The proposed final dividend brings the total dividend for the year 
to 29.75p per share, up 4.8%. This is in line with the board’s policy 
of maintaining a dividend cover of around two times underlying 
earnings, while continuing to invest for future growth, and maintains 
our long-term track record of annual dividend growth.

RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES
STRATEGIC RISKS

Integration of Spirit Pub 
Company and delivery 
of anticipated synergies.
Reduced revenue, profitability 
and lower growth rates.
Integration steering committee established to oversee integration, with agreed 
guidelines as to the aims of the integration.
Retention arrangements in place for key staff.
Communication plan designed to keep all staff and other stakeholders informed 
of progress and changes impacting them. 
Synergy targets established and systems are in place to record synergies captured. 
Plans to deliver revenue synergies through rationalisation of brands and offers 
are being drawn up.
Failure to develop an appealing 
customer offer (including through 
diversification), to identify 
and respond to fast-changing 
consumer tastes and to maintain 
and grow market share.
Reduced revenue, profitability 
and lower growth rates.
Research conducted into consumer trends and plans developed to respond to key trends.
Use of guest satisfaction tools and Net Promoter Scores to collect customer 
feedback and measure performance of our pubs.
Greater investment in support and training for our employees to ensure service 
standards meet consumer expectations.
Enhanced use of social media to communicate better with our customers 
and other consumers.
Diversification options kept under constant review.
We have a formal risk management process which is designed to identify, assess 
and prioritise risks within the business, so that their impact on sustainable 
profitability is minimised and the group is able to deliver our business plans 
and strategic objectives, as well as to maximise shareholder returns. 
The board retains ultimate responsibility for the group’s risk 
management framework and reviews the group’s principal risks on 
an annual basis. The board has delegated responsibility for assurance 
for the risk management process to the audit committee, which 
regularly reviews the risk management processes for each division 
and functional area. The implementation of risk management and 
internal control systems is the responsibility of the executive 
directors and other senior management.
Each division and functional area is tasked with maintaining, 
reviewing and regularly updating a risk register. Classification 
of risks takes into account the likelihood of their occurrence and 
the scale of potential impact (both financial and reputational) on 
the business. Each division and functional area is then responsible 
for evaluating current controls and drawing up plans to improve 
controls and manage new risks. Progress of these risk implementation 
plans is monitored by senior management on a regular basis. 
In addition, a group-wide risk committee reviews the individual 
risk registers in detail, monitors the risk mitigation plans and 
assists in the production of the group risk register. 
Given that some risks are external and not fully within our control, 
the risk management processes are designed to manage risks which 
may have a material impact on our business, rather than to fully 
mitigate all risks.
This section highlights some of the key risks and uncertainties 
which affect Greene King, but it is not intended to be an exhaustive 
analysis of all risks facing the business.

Strategic report
CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY CONTINUED
We want to deliver the best experience possible for our customers 
when they visit us. Our pubs have an important role to play in providing 
a safe, affordable and convenient experience for our customers, 
families and communities across the country.
To support our customers wishing to make healthier lifestyle decisions, 
we are committed to providing great quality and choice. We continue 
to focus on delivering industry-leading value, service and quality 
to our customers. 
Healthy eating
This year, we have developed one of the industry’s leading menus 
with ‘under 500 calories’ options. Our Mainstream High Street 
menu now offers a selection of ten under 500 calories dishes. 
Our nutritional manager continues to support the development 
of healthier menu options for our customers and manages our 
continued commitment to the Government’s Public Health 
Responsibility Deal food pledges.
We have also implemented a food management system, which will 
enable us to have greater visibility of the nutritional content of our 
products and dishes. 
Allergens
In line with the allergen legislation that came into effect in December last 
year, we have increased awareness on the importance of allergens both 
internally and externally. We have developed and rolled out an allergen 
training module which gives our staff an understanding of allergens, 
and we now provide full allergen information across our retail estate to 
help customers make more informed decisions when dining with us. 
Gluten 
This year, we have continued to expand our range of non-gluten 
containing menu choices for our customers wishing to avoid gluten. 
Our continued focus for the future is to expand our nutritional 
expertise along with developing our menus with lower calorie 
and healthier options for our customers. 
Awards 
We have won a number of awards this year, demonstrating our hard 
work and commitment to providing great value and choice to our 
customers, including:
 – Flame Grill won the 2015 National Fish and Chips Awards for food 
quality, marketing activity, customer service and commercial awareness. 
 – Premium Locals won the Best Pub Menu award at Restaurant 
magazine’s Development Chef Awards.
Food standards 
We are committed to delivering and actively promoting excellent 
food and kitchen standards. In our Retail business, we set to do this 
by training, external audits, open dialogue with local authorities 
and operational incentive schemes. 
Quality standards for our beers
Once again, the Westgate Brewery in Bury St Edmunds and the 
Belhaven Brewery in Dunbar both maintained an A grade rating 
with the British Retail Consortium. These awards confirm that our 
beer is produced to the highest quality and food safety standards.
Since launching the quality and dispense services department in our 
Brewing & Brands division, we have completed over 1,000 trade quality 
audits covering our entire Pub Partners and Inns estates. As a result, 
we have improved the quality standards in our cellars and dispense 
equipment which has led to improved standards in Pub Partners as 
the pass rate rose from 65% to 88%. We are now progressing with 
the auditing of the rest of our Retail estate. 
This year, eight of our beers won awards at the Monde Selection, 
an independent stamp of approval for quality. The results included 
a grand gold and five gold awards, including Belhaven Scottish Ale 
receiving the highest honour and Greene King IPA, Old Hoppy Hen 
and East Coast IPA also receiving awards.

Tackling under-age sales 
We train all new bar staff on our central online training tool, which 
provides learning on obligations and responsibilities of the employee 
to materials highlighting the impact of alcohol on children. The training 
course must be completed and passed before our staff can serve alcohol.
All of our Retail premises operate the ‘Challenge 21’ or 
‘Challenge 25’ programmes. 
We also support the principles laid out in the Portman Code of 
Practice on responsible retailing of alcohol. Not only are all retail 
managers and bar staff trained when they join us, we ensure this 
training is ongoing so they understand their role in promoting 
the responsible consumption of alcohol by our customers. 
Best Bar None and Pub Watch schemes
We support National Best Bar None and, importantly, at a local level 
we work with a number of regions to promote and roll out the scheme. 
For example, Nottinghamshire County Council has opened up a Best 
Bar None scheme and all available Greene King venues are participating. 
We are proud that a significant number of our Belhaven pubs 
achieved Best Bar None accreditations this year, including 36 golds, 
41 silvers and 13 bronze awards.
In England, our Retail pubs belong to Pub Watch and Best Bar None 
where access to these schemes is available. 
Limit awareness 
We continue to support the Government’s anti-drink drive Christmas 
campaign. For the sixth year running, we supported the Designated 
Driver Christmas Campaign in conjunction with Coca-Cola Enterprises 
Limited in the majority of our pub estate, where designated drivers 
were offered free soft drinks at Christmas.
Minimum unit pricing for alcohol
Greene King has long advocated the need for a minimum unit price (MUP) 
for alcohol in the UK in order to tackle the misuse of alcohol, which 
causes ill health and can lead to anti-social behaviour within communities. 
We remain committed to the introduction of minimum unit pricing. 
Public Health Responsibility Deal 
We are currently signed up to eight pledges in the Government’s 
Public Health Responsibility Deal (PHRD) to make improvements 
which affect our customers, people and environment. We have again 
progressed with these during the last year. The PHRD aims to tap 
into our potential to make a significant contribution to improving 
public health by taking a joint approach to tackling the challenges 
caused by lifestyle changes. By signing up to these pledges we are 
committed to taking voluntarily action to improve public health.

of Health PHRD website www.responsibilitydeal.dh.gov.uk.

OUR COMMUNITIES
Pubs have always played an important role in the community and 
they continue to do so. They provide a place where everyone can 
come together to relax or put the world to rights, to enjoy time with 
family or celebrate with friends. We understand that maintaining 
the presence of a pub in a community is essential and therefore we 
have developed a programme to support key organisations that 
address inequalities in our society.
Pub is the Hub 
Once again, we have supported Pub is the Hub by providing £15,000 
of central funding. This is the second year we have donated to this 
not-for-profit organisation that is dedicated to offering advice and 
support to licensees, rural pubs and community services. 
Our funding supported the Community Services Fund, which aims 
to provide funds to licensees who are looking to broaden their services 
to the wider community and cannot find suitable funding from other 
sources. The fund has benefited over 40,000 people, supported 
38 projects in England and helped offer more than 47 types 
of additional services, such as libraries or butchers.
Macmillan Cancer Support
Three years ago, we embarked on our first Greene King national 
charity partnership with Macmillan Cancer Support. Through the 
hard work, commitment, creativity and passion of our employees 
and the generosity and support of our customers, we were delighted 
to announce that we have raised £1.6m in those three years.
The partnership has brought unity to our business and generated 
positive local and trade press, and goodwill within our local communities.
We were delighted to be shortlisted for the Employee Engagement 
category of the Third Sector Business Charity Awards 2014, recognising 
our investment and commitment in launching our first charity 
partnership and the incredible success in engaging our employees.
Focus 12 
We continue to support the charity Focus 12, based close to our 
head office and brewery in Bury St Edmunds, Suffolk. Focus 12 provides 
treatment for clients with drug and alcohol dependency, as well as 
guidance and counselling for affected family members. 
We once again championed the annual charity ball this year, which 
took place in St Edmundsbury Cathedral, close to our brewery. 
The event and online auction raised more than £25,000, and we 
have now raised more than £80,000 for the charity. 
ITV’s Text Santa
More than 600 of our pubs took part in ITV’s Text Santa fundraising 
appeal by hosting pub quizzes across the country in the lead up to 
Christmas. The money raised was split between the chosen charities 
Teenage Cancer Trust, Guide Dogs, WellChild, Marie Curie Cancer 
Care, Alzheimer’s Society and Together for Short Lives. 
Dementia Friends
This year, more than 1,000 of our employees got behind the Alzheimer’s 
Society’s initiative and signed up to become a Dementia Friend. As a pub, 
restaurant and hotel operator, our employees have the opportunity 
to make a difference to the lives of our customers with dementia 
and by learning more about the condition will be able to give greater 
understanding and support to those that live with the disease.
CASE STUDY
Reaching £1.6m
We are proud that our pubs and employees have made our 
partnership with Macmillan such a success. To raise £1.6m, 
they have engaged our customers, communities, shareholders 
and suppliers. They have been creative with fundraising, 
but most of all they have pushed themselves and each other. 
Some highlights from our partnership include:
 – In May 2014, over 160 employees came together from across 
the whole business to take on the Yorkshire Three Peaks 
Challenge, raising over £80,000.
 – We are one of the largest corporate supporters of 
Macmillan’s World’s Biggest Coffee Morning, raising 
over £342,000 in the past three years.
 – The partnership has delivered a number of highly successful 
commercially focused activities, including promotions on 
selected desserts, which has raised over £150,000.
 – A central donation to the Woolverstone fundraising appeal 
to build a cancer treatment centre in Ipswich, which will 
support people from our local community around our head 
office in Suffolk.
 – And finally, our people. We have seen some inspired divisional 
fundraising events: Local Pubs’ Macmillan May (fundraising 
during the whole month of May); Hungry Horse ‘Tour de Horse’ 
(a bespoke cycle challenge that followed the route of the Tour 
de France in the UK); Belhaven’s month of fundraising; and 
the individuals who continue to challenge themselves to raise 
money by hiking through foreign countries, running marathons, 
climbing mountains, swimming lakes, and organising quizzes, 
cake sales and fun days. GREENE KING PLC Annual report 2015 34

CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY CONTINUED
OUR PEOPLE
Our people are our lifeblood and our greatest asset. With around 
40,000 employees in total following the Spirit acquisition, attracting 
and retaining the best people and developing and nurturing talent is 
essential to our continued success and the future growth of our business.
Employee engagement
This year we have enhanced our employee engagement questionnaire 
in order to identify areas that are most important to our employees 
at work, as well as their experiences. This has given us greater insight 
into four key indicators: clarity, confidence, enablement and impact 
– all of which create a high performance environment. Change can 
be unsettling but we were pleased that our employee engagement 
remained level versus last year at 70%. We were also able to evaluate 
our Net Promoter Score (NPS) which resulted in 89% of employees 
saying they would recommend Greene King as a place to work. 
The results are currently being cascaded throughout the business 
and detailed action plans for areas of improvement will be implemented.
Developing our talent
At Greene King, we recognise the wider benefits of developing 
internal talent and career paths that support increased employee 
retention and productivity, employee engagement and provide 
long-term career opportunities. 
Apprenticeships 
We believe in the value of apprenticeships and continue to invest in 
our employees but also to support young people to get that all-important 
first step on the career ladder. We signed up to the Government’s 
apprenticeship scheme in February 2011 and, so far, more than 
3,000 employees have achieved a qualification. For the second year 
running, we have committed to recruiting another 2,000 
apprenticeships this year. 
Our apprenticeship scheme has supported our ambition to combat 
the industry shortage of chefs and since last summer, more than 
75% of all recruited apprentices have been for ‘back of house’ roles, 
including in the kitchen. 
Where we create new jobs when acquiring, refurbishing or building 
new businesses, we work closely with Job Centre Plus to provide 
opportunities through pre-employment training for young people 
and the long-term unemployed.
Creating jobs
Through the opening of new sites for Hungry Horse and Farmhouse 
Inns, we created 1,328 new jobs across the country in the last 12 months.
Diversity 
We operate an equal opportunities policy to ensure that employees 
are recruited, developed, remunerated and promoted on the basis of 
their skills and suitability for the work performed. We are committed 
to making full use of the talents and resources of all our employees 
and to ensuring that no employee receives less favourable treatment 
on the grounds of their colour, nationality, race, religion/belief, ethnic 
or national origin, sex, marital or civil partnership status, gender 
reassignment (whether proposed, started or completed and under 
or not under medical supervision), disability or past disability, part-time 
or fixed-term status, pregnancy or maternity, parental responsibilities, 
sexual orientation or age (a protected characteristic).

We are fully compliant with Workplace Pensions Reform Regulations and

Support for our tenants
Greene King Pub Partners has been successfully providing opportunities 
for self-employed entrepreneurs for over 200 years and continues 
to provide a variety of different agreement options for a high quality 
estate of pubs, ranging from Michelin-starred premium food pubs 
to the village local at the heart of the community. Our pubs are as 
individual as the people who run them, and often thrive on offering 
genuine local provenance and community activity. The level of support 
that we provide to our tenants and lessees is central to us being 
a preferred partner for the best licensees in the country.
Our support is tailored to meet the individual needs of our licensee 
partners and includes industry-leading training for them and their staff, 
expert business advice, and effective marketing support. In addition 
to this we have this year introduced a new range of initiatives, led 
by our Brewing & Brands dispense team, to enable our tenants and 
lessees to maintain consistently outstanding cellar quality ensuring 
that our beer brands are consistently being offered at their best.
This is all underpinned by our professionally qualified BDMs 
who are trained to the highest levels in the industry and who are 
dedicated to supporting all our licensee partners in making the 
most of their business opportunities.
CASE STUDY
Apprenticeships – Mark Robinson, Masons Arms
Mark Robinson, 25, is a duty manager at one of our busiest pubs, 
the Masons Arms in Wickersley. He can see the career potential 
in hospitality and is using apprenticeships to get there. 
With the goal of becoming a general manager, Mark is now working 
towards his fourth apprenticeship since he started working at 
Greene King seven years ago. He has completed Hospitality 
Services Level 2, Team Leading Level 2 and Customer Services 
Level 3 and has recently started ILM (Institute of Leadership 
and Management) Level 4 qualification. 
Mark said: “They were right when they said the Level 4 leadership 
and management qualification would require a lot of effort but it 
is worth it as I know there will be so many benefits from completing 
the course. So far we’ve looked at management theories and learning 
styles. It is fascinating stuff and I hope this will stand me in good 
stead to become a strong general manager. Meeting and networking 
with managers from other brands has been eye opening too and 
has given me a fresh perspective on management.” Annual report 2015 GREENE KING PLC 35
Corporate governance Strategic report Financial statements Shareholder information
Our aim is to reduce the environmental impact of our business wherever 
we can. Particular areas of focus for us are reducing our energy and 
water consumption and reducing waste across on the business.
Energy
We have continued to convert the lighting in our pubs, restaurants 
and hotels to the latest low energy LED light bulbs, converting 
another 260 sites during the year. We now have 60% of our retail 
business converted to LED lighting.
A further 36 sites have been fitted with voltage optimisers which 
reduce the electricity used and prolong the life of electrical 
equipment in the premises.
Further gas efficiencies have been achieved by upgrading 
the boilers and heating control systems in another 55 sites.
Water
We have continued to observe water usage in the 200 sites with 
water monitors and have used this information to set benchmarks 
for the different types of outlets. Pubs selling mainly drinks, smaller 
restaurants, Hungry Horse, Farmhouse Inns, Loch Fyne restaurants 
and hotels now all have their own targets that allow us to spot 
significant usage variances and instigate remedies.
We continue to work with the 20 water companies that supply us 
nationally to ensure more frequent and accurate meter readings and 
to use their local teams to help us investigate leaks and implement 
best practice to make further savings.
In 980 comparable sites, we have used marginally less water than 
the previous year and helped offset the additional water use in 
kitchens as food sales grow.
The amount of water required to make a barrel of beer reduced at 
our Belhaven brewery last year. However, at our Bury St Edmunds 
brewery, this increased, largely as a result of the success of our 
take-home operations. The change in mix from cask and keg to 
bottle and can incorporates more processing and, therefore, more 
water is required. We are planning water saving projects during 
the next year to counterbalance this trend. 
Waste 
As a HaFSA signatory, we continue to work with WRAP to increase 
the overall rate of food and packaging waste being recycled, sent to 
anaerobic digestion (AD) or composted to at least 70% by the end of 2015.
Recycling over the past year has increased by over 6% as a result 
of bin optimisation, resulting in less waste going to landfill. We are 
currently exploring opportunities to further increase recycling 
by expanding our food collections throughout the estate.
Over 570 of retail sites divert more than 80% of their waste from landfill.
Mandatory greenhouse gas reporting
The table below, which has been produced in compliance with the 
requirements of the Companies Act 2006 (Strategic and Directors’ 
Report) Regulations 2013, shows the main greenhouse gas emissions 
in tonnes of CO
2
 equivalent (CO
2
e) for our scope 1 (direct) and scope 
2 (indirect) CO
2
 emissions. 
Scope 1 relates to the direct emissions from the fuels we use in our 
breweries, pubs, restaurants, hotels and offices such as natural gas 
and liquid petroleum gas. It also includes emissions from owned 
vehicles (including company cars) but excludes logistics where we 
outsource this to third parties. Refrigerant gas and F-gas emissions 
in respect of our breweries, pubs and restaurants are also included. 
We have used the UK Government’s GHG Conversion Factors for 
Company Reporting for all scope 1 emissions (2013 for 2013/14 and 2014 
for 2014/15). GHG emissions from refrigeration and air conditioning 
units for 2014/15 have been determined using the simplified material 
balance method (which is a more accurate method of calculating 
emissions) as described in the Environmental Reporting Guidelines 
2013, whereas the emissions for 2013/14 were calculated using the 
screening method. 
Scope 2 relates to the indirect emissions associated with the generation 
of electricity consumed in our sites. Emissions have been calculated 
using the Carbon Reduction Commitment (CRC) Energy Efficiency 
Scheme factor (2013 for 2013/14 and 2014 for 2014/15).
Electricity and gas figures in the table below cover the CRC reporting 
period from 1 April to 31 March each year, whilst all other figures cover 
our respective financial years. The intensity ratio refers to turnover 
in our Retail and Brewing & Brands businesses as the vast majority 
of our CO
2
 emissions relate to those businesses.

Corporate governance
CORPORATE GOVERNANCE STATEMENT
I am pleased to have the opportunity once again to introduce the 
company’s corporate governance report. It is vital to have a strong and 
effective governance system if the business is to be able to deliver its 
strategy, generate shareholder value and safeguard our shareholders’ 
long-term interests. Well balanced and effective boards, strong 
oversight of risk management, alignment of remuneration policies 
with shareholder interests and sound shareholder relations are all 
key elements of our governance framework. 
In our corporate governance report and the reports from the board 
committees, we describe the operation of the board and explain 
how we applied the principles of good governance set out in the 
code during the year. 
One key priority this year has been the issue of board succession, 
with John Brady retiring at the end of July 2014 and the 
appointment of Rob Rowley as his successor. 
 We also had to respond to the illness of our group finance director, 
Matthew Fearn, who left the business in the autumn to focus on his 
health. Kirk Davis was appointed as our new chief financial officer 
and joined us in November 2014.
The audit committee continued to review key accounting and 
reporting matters and further details are set out in its report. 
Likewise, the remuneration committee report sets out more details 
of its activities during the year, whilst the directors’ remuneration 
report includes details of the remuneration paid to directors 
during the year.
Two other areas of particular focus for the board this year 
have been the acquisition of Spirit Pub Company plc (Spirit) and 
board evaluation. For the Spirit acquisition the board was closely 
involved in the strategic considerations surrounding the proposed 
acquisition, as well as having oversight of the processes followed 
to put together the formal takeover documentation. 
The board also followed best practice and undertook an externally 
facilitated board evaluation exercise, more details of which are set 
out on page 41. The evaluation will be very useful in guiding future 
ways of working for the board and its committees.

Statement of compliance with the UK 
Corporate Governance Code
The company is subject to the UK Corporate Governance Code 
which is issued by the Financial Reporting Council and which is 
available at www.frc.org.uk. The code sets out guidance in the form 
of principles and provisions on how companies should be directed 
and controlled to follow good governance practice. Companies 
listed in the UK are required to disclose how they have applied the 
main principles and whether they have complied with its provisions 
throughout the financial year. Where the provisions have not been 
complied with companies must provide an explanation. 
The board considers that the company has complied with the UK 
Corporate Governance Code dated September 2012 throughout the 
year. We will report against the revised version of the Code, which 
was published in September 2014, next year.
CHAIRMAN’S INTRODUCTION Annual report 2015 GREENE KING PLC 39
Corporate governance Strategic report Financial statements Shareholder information
The board
Board composition
As at the year end the board comprised the chairman, two executive 
directors and four non-executive directors. The board believes that 
the structure and size of the board is appropriate and that no single 
individual or group dominates the decision making process. 
The non-executive chairman is Tim Bridge and the chief executive 
is Rooney Anand. The senior independent director during the year 
was Ian Durant. 
John Brady, who was appointed to the board as a non-executive 
director in 2005, retired from the board in July 2014 and was 
succeeded by Rob Rowley, who also took over as senior independent 
director from the beginning of the current financial year. 
Matthew Fearn, our chief financial officer, fell ill during the year and 
agreement was reached with him on 1 October 2014 that he should 
stand down as a director so that he and his family could focus on his 
health. The board appointed Kirk Davis as chief financial officer 
in his place and he joined the board on 3 November 2014. More 
details on the board changes can be found in the nomination 
committee report.
The directors’ biographies are on page 37. 
Independence of non-executive directors
In compliance with the UK Corporate Governance Code, more 
than half of the board, excluding the chairman, are non-executive 
directors. The board is satisfied that all of the non-executive directors 
were independent throughout the year, in that they satisfied the 
independence criteria of the code on their appointment and 
continue to satisfy those criteria. 
Tim Bridge, the chairman, was not independent on appointment, 
having previously served as chief executive. However, the board is 
satisfied that he shows independent judgment, that his performance 
as chairman is effective and that he demonstrates continued 
commitment to the role. 
Ian Durant was the senior independent non-executive director 
during the year. From the beginning of the current financial year 
this role was taken over by Rob Rowley, given Ian Durant’s upcoming 
retirement from the board in March 2016. Neither has ever been 
employed by the company and both have diverse business interests. 
The board considers that Ian Durant remained independent in both 
character and judgment, that his performance was effective and 
that he demonstrated commitment to the role. The board considers 
that the same applies to Rob Rowley. As well as supporting the 
chairman and acting as a sounding board for the chairman and an 
intermediary for other directors, a key responsibility for the senior 
independent director is to be available for direct contact from 
shareholders should they require. 
GREENE KING BOARD

 – approve the group’s long-term objectives, commercial strategy and the overall funding strategy;

CORPORATE GOVERNANCE STATEMENT CONTINUED
Leadership
Role of the board
The board has collective responsibility for the long-term success of the 
company and for its leadership, strategy, control and management. 
The offices of chairman and chief executive are separate and distinct 
and the division of responsibilities between them has been clearly 
established, set out in writing and agreed by the board. 
The chairman is responsible for the leadership and effectiveness of 
the board and for ensuring that each non-executive director is able 
to make an effective contribution to the board through debate and 
discussion with the executive directors. He is also responsible 
for setting the style and tone of board discussions.
The chief executive’s role is to develop the company’s strategic direction 
and to lead senior management in executing the company’s strategy 
and managing the operational requirements of the business. 
The non-executive directors have a particular responsibility to 
ensure that the strategies proposed by the executive directors are 
carefully examined and fully discussed, that the performance of 
the company is monitored and challenged and that the financial 
information provided is comprehensive and accurate. They are also 
responsible for ensuring, through the relevant committees, that 
appropriate remuneration arrangements are in place for the 
executive directors.
Operation of the board
The board has a formal schedule of matters which are reserved for 
its consideration, including approval of the long-term objectives and 
strategy, approval of budgets and financial statements including the 
annual report and accounts, acquisitions and disposals, changes to 
the structure of the group and overall corporate governance issues. 
It reviews trading performance and considers major capital 
expenditure and acquisition opportunities. 
The board has delegated certain responsibilities to standing 
committees, details of which are set out on page 39. By delegating 
key responsibilities to these committees, the board is able to ensure 
that adequate time is devoted by board members to the oversight 
of key areas within their responsibility.
Day-to-day management and control of the business is delegated 
to the executive directors, business unit managing directors and 
certain key functional heads, who meet formally on a four-weekly 
basis together with other senior managers as appropriate. 
Board meetings are scheduled to be held eight times a year, with 
main meetings linked to key events in the company’s financial 
calendar, with the annual results and dividend being approved in 
June or July and the interim results and dividend in November or 
December. Regular agenda items include an overview of the market 
and current trading as well as a detailed review of financial 
performance against agreed targets. 
There is a two-day meeting for the board in February each year 
focusing on strategy, with the business unit managing directors and 
heads of the main functional areas, namely commercial, HR and 
property, attending for part thereof. The strategy sessions include 
an in-depth review of relevant economic factors, management’s 
projections for the medium term and provide the board with an 
opportunity to agree the strategic plans across all areas for the short 
and medium term. Following approval of the company’s strategy, 
budgets are prepared for the next financial year to be approved by 
the board in April. The board also has a programme to review each 
business unit and main functional area in detail on a regular basis, 
with particular focus on the achievement of strategic objectives. 
The relevant managing director or functional head attends such 
meetings to present and answer questions.
The board has responsibility for determining whether the annual 
report, taken as a whole, is fair balanced and understandable to 
enable shareholders to assess the company’s performance, business 
model and strategy. In coming to its view, the board took into account 
its own knowledge of the group, its strategy and performance in the 
year, the guidance given to all contributors to the annual report and 
a detailed review by senior management of the overall content.
A key matter considered during the year was the proposed acquisition 
of Spirit. The board determined initially that the proposed acquisition 
was consistent with the group’s stated strategy. It then oversaw the offer 
process, reviewed the detailed documentation necessary to effect the 
acquisition, including the merger synergy estimate, and received 
regular reports on the regulatory process undertaken to obtain the 
necessary antitrust approval for the proposed acquisition. More 
recently the board has focused its attentions on the planned integration 
of the Spirit business, and it will continue to oversee the integration 
to ensure that planned synergies are effectively captured and that the 
business is appropriately managed both during the integration period 
and thereafter.
Other matters specifically considered during the year included 
property disposals, financing, taxation, risk management and 
key group risks, which are discussed on page 28.
Between meetings, as required, the board can be in frequent 
contact to progress the company’s business and if necessary, board 
meetings can be held at short notice. Where possible, however, ad hoc 
committees of the board are appointed to deal with matters which 
it is known will need to be dealt with between scheduled board 
meetings. It is expected that all directors attend board and relevant 
committee meetings, unless they are prevented from doing so by 
prior commitments. If directors are unable to attend meetings 
in person or by telephone they are given the opportunity to be 
consulted and comment in advance of the meeting. 
Attendance at scheduled meetings held during the year is set out below.

Board effectiveness
Board performance and evaluation
The board conducts an annual evaluation of its own performance 
and that of its committees and directors. This year, in line with the 
UK Corporate Governance Code, an externally facilitated evaluation has 
been undertaken. Nigel Davies of NJMD Corporate Services Limited 
was appointed to conduct the evaluation, which commenced towards the 
end of the financial year. The evaluation took the form of a detailed 
questionnaire that all directors were asked to complete. The questionnaire 
covered a range of areas including questions on board structure and 
composition, strategy and financials, board processes, risks, the board’s 
committees and on corporate governance generally. This was followed 
up with a series of interviews of the directors by the external facilitator, 
who then produced a written report for the board. A number of 
observations (relating to matters including training for directors, 
the role of the senior independent director, diversity, succession 
plans and risk management) were made by the external facilitator 
which will be addressed in the coming months, but there were no 
areas of major concern identified for the board to consider, and the 
evaluator concluded that the board was effectively run and administered. 
In addition to the formal evaluation exercise there is an ongoing 
dialogue within the board to ensure that it operates effectively 
and that any matters raised are addressed in a timely manner. 
An appraisal of the chairman’s performance was undertaken by 
the senior independent director, Ian Durant, in conjunction with 
the other non-executive directors. The performance of the executive 
directors is reviewed annually by the remuneration committee in 
conjunction with their annual pay review and the payment of bonuses. 
Training and support
The training needs of the board and its committees are regularly 
reviewed and each director is responsible for ensuring that they 
remain up to date in their skills and knowledge of the company. 
Particular emphasis is placed on ensuring that directors are aware 
of proposed legislative changes in areas such as corporate governance, 
financial reporting and sector specific issues. All directors are also 
encouraged to visit the company’s pubs and restaurants and do so 
throughout the year. 
Newly appointed directors receive a tailored induction on joining the 
board to acquaint them with the company, which takes the form of 
meetings with other board members and senior management, and the 
provision of an induction pack containing general information on 
the company, its policies and procedures, financial and operational 
information and a briefing on directors’ responsibilities. Both 
Rob Rowley and Kirk Davis received appropriate inductions 
on joining the board.
There is an agreed procedure, set out in writing, for directors, in 
furtherance of their duties, to take independent professional advice 
at the company’s expense. Directors also have access to the services 
of the company secretary. The company has in place directors’ 
and officers’ liability insurance.
Commitment and conflicts of interest
All significant commitments which the directors have outside 
Greene King are disclosed prior to appointment and on an ongoing 
basis when there are any changes. The board is satisfied that each of 
the non-executive directors commits sufficient time to their duties 
and fulfils their obligations to the company.
The board has the right, under the articles of association, to 
approve potential situational conflicts of interest. A small number of 
such potential conflicts have been approved by the board following 
disclosure by certain directors, in each case with the relevant director 
not taking part in any decision relating to their own position. Directors 
are also aware that the disclosure and authorisation of any potential 
conflict situation does not detract from their requirement to notify 
the board separately of an actual or potential conflict in relation 
to a proposed transaction by the company. 
Communication with shareholders 
The board is keen to ensure that our shareholders have a good 
understanding of the business and its performance, and that the 
directors are aware of any issues or concerns which shareholders 
may have. Communication with shareholders takes a variety of forms.
Institutional shareholders and analysts
There is a regular dialogue with institutional shareholders, 
including meetings after the announcement of the year end and 
interim results. Analysts are also invited to presentations at those 
times and separately to analyst trips to visit our premises and hear 
presentations on specific divisions of the business. The board 
receives regular reports and feedback on the meetings held 
between the executive directors and principal shareholders, 
and copies of analysts’ reports on the company. 
The senior independent non-executive director, Rob Rowley, is 
available to shareholders if they have concerns about governance 
issues which the normal channels of contact fail to resolve. 
AGM
The AGM is fully utilised as a means of communicating directly 
with private shareholders, who receive a brief presentation on the 
business before the formal business of the meeting begins. They 
also have the full opportunity to ask questions during the meeting 
and to meet directors and senior management informally after the 
meeting. The board aims to ensure that all members of the board, 
including in particular the chairmen of the board committees, are 
available to answer questions at the AGM. 
The notice of the AGM is sent to shareholders at least twenty working 
days before the meeting. All substantive items of business at shareholders’ 
meetings are dealt with under separate resolutions, including a 
resolution to adopt the report and accounts. The chairman announces 
the results of the proxy voting on each resolution after it has been 
dealt with on a show of hands. 
The next AGM will be held on 8 September 2015 at the Millennium 
Grandstand, Rowley Mile Racecourse Conference Centre, Newmarket, 
Suffolk CB8 0TF. Details can be found in the separate notice of meeting.
Website
The company maintains a website (www.greeneking.co.uk) to provide 
up-to-date, detailed information on the company’s operations and brands, 
which includes a dedicated investor relations section. All company 
announcements are available on this site, as are copies of slides used 
for presentations to investment analysts. We are happy to answer 
questions by telephone or email (investorrelations@greeneking.co.uk 
or companysecretary@greeneking.co.uk).
Board committees
The board has established a nomination committee, a remuneration 
committee and an audit committee, each of which has formal terms 
of reference governing its method of operation. Each of the terms 
of reference, which have been approved by the board, are available 
on request or to download from the company’s website and will 
be available for inspection at the AGM.
DTR disclosure
The information required by DTR 7.2 is set out in this report, 
the nomination committee report and the audit committee report, 
except for information required under DTR 7.2.6 which is set out 
in the directors’ report. GREENE KING PLC Annual report 2015 42
Corporate governance
REPORT OF THE NOMINATION COMMITTEE
The role of the committee is principally focused on the size, 
composition and structure of the board. To do that, its role is to 
propose appointments to the board following a formal, rigorous 
and transparent appointment process.
Membership
During the year the nomination committee was chaired by Tim Bridge. 
The other members of the committee were John Brady (until his 
retirement in July 2014), Mike Coupe, Ian Durant, Rob Rowley (who 
joined the board and the committee in July 2014) and Lynne Weedall. 
Apart from the chairman, all members were considered by the 
board to be independent.
Responsibilities
The role of the nomination committee is to identify, evaluate 
and nominate candidates for appointment to the board, to 
review regularly the structure, size and composition (including 
skills, knowledge and experience) of the board and to make 
recommendations to the board with regard to any adjustments 
that are deemed necessary. 
The committee is also responsible for considering the company’s 
succession plans for board members and senior management, taking 
into account the challenges and opportunities facing the company, 
and what skills and expertise are therefore needed on the board in 
the future, and for reviewing membership of the board’s committees 
to ensure that undue reliance is not placed upon any individuals.
Activities during the year
The committee held four meetings during the year. Attendance at these 
meetings by the committee members is shown in the table on page 40. 
With John Brady retiring from the board in July 2014, a key activity 
for the committee was to find a suitable successor to him. When 
making new appointments, the policy of the company is to recruit 
on merit for each role on offer, whether executive or non-executive. 
We set out a job specification and a profile of the likely characteristics, 
qualifications, experience and merits required before starting a search, 
and aim to find the individual who is best suited to the role, without 
prejudice between male and female candidates. 
For our new non-executive director, the Zygos Partnership, which 
has signed up to the voluntary code of conduct on matters such as 
diversity for executive search firms, was appointed to conduct the 
search, and produced a long-list of candidates for the role. 
The chairman and other members of the nomination committee 
interviewed a short-list of candidates and selected Rob Rowley 
based on objective criteria. 
For the chief financial officer role, the search was conducted by 
Hoggett Bowers, which has also signed up to the voluntary code 
of conduct on matters such as diversity for executive search firms. 
A number of committee members met Kirk Davis prior to recommending 
him as the new chief financial officer, replacing Matthew Fearn 
who sadly had to leave us because of his ill health. 
The committee also considered committee composition during the 
year. On the recommendation of the committee, Rob Rowley was 
appointed as a member of the nomination committee and of the audit 
committee when he joined the board. With his recent and relevant 
financial experience (as former finance director of Reuters Group plc) 
it is currently anticipated that he will take over the chairmanship 
of the audit committee in due course from Ian Durant, who is due 
to retire from the board in March 2016. No other changes were 
recommended to the composition of the board committees. Since 
the year end Rob Rowley has also been appointed as a member of the 
remuneration committee, again on the recommendation of the 
nomination committee.
The issues of succession planning and board structure will remain the 
ongoing focus of the committee during the course of the forthcoming year.
On the recommendation of the nomination committee, and taking 
into account the continuing effective performance of the directors, 
the board has decided once again this year to ask all directors to 
stand for re-election at the forthcoming AGM. 
Other matters considered by the committee during the year 
included the board evaluation exercise, training requirements 
for directors and the committee’s terms of reference. 
Diversity
The board approves of the principle of trying to recruit more women 
into senior management and director roles. We currently have one 
female director on the board, Lynne Weedall, who is chairman of the 
remuneration committee. With a board of seven people, we believe 
the key is to ensure a suitable range of skills, experience and knowledge 
across the board members, and that the issues of gender and diversity 
are just two considerations to be taken into account when filling 
board vacancies.
“I am pleased to have the opportunity to introduce our 
nomination committee report for 2014/15 and to explain 
the focus and the activities of the committee during the year.”

REPORT OF THE AUDIT COMMITTEE
During the year the committee has focused on the following key 
areas: the year-end audit and interim audit review; the relationship 
with the external auditor; and the development of the internal audit 
function. During 2015/16 the committee is expecting to focus on 
the risk management and control internal control aspects of the 
integration of Spirit Pub Company plc and the changes to the UK 
Corporate Governance Code which will take effect next year. 
Membership
The audit committee was chaired during the year by Ian Durant. 
The other members of the committee were Mike Coupe and 
Rob Rowley, following his appointment to the board in July 2014. 
John Brady was also a member of the committee prior to his 
retirement in July 2014. All members are considered by the board 
to be independent. The board is satisfied that Ian Durant has recent 
and relevant financial experience, as the former finance director of 
Liberty International plc, since renamed as Intu Properties PLC, 
and the current audit committee chairman at Home Retail Group plc. 
Responsibilities
The audit committee has responsibility for reviewing financial 
reporting, controls and risk management processes across the 
group. As part of its role, the committee assesses the external audit 
conclusions on both the full year and interim results, in each case 
prior to their submission to the board. The board has continued to 
undertake the required assessment that the annual report is fair, 
balanced and understandable and consequently does not ask the 
audit committee to advise it on this. The committee reviews the 
company’s internal control systems, advises the board on the 
appointment of external auditor, oversees the relationship with 
the external auditors, and reviews the quality and effectiveness of 
both the internal and the external audit. The committee is also 
responsible for considering the company’s whistle blowing procedures 
and reviewing their effectiveness in practice. In relation to risk 
matters, the committee also reviews the group’s risk management 
policies and procedures prior to submission to the board and receives 
detailed reports on the risk management processes within the 
business units and key functional areas. The committee receives 
regular updates on regulatory, accounting and reporting 
developments and their application to the company.
Operation of the committee
The committee met three times during the year. Attendance at 
these meetings by the committee members is shown in the table 
on page 40. On each occasion the chief financial officer (or interim 
finance director) and senior members of the finance function attended, 
as well as the company secretary, head of risk and members of the 
internal audit function. The external auditors attended all of the 
meetings. By rotation, operational managers present risk reports at 
audit committee meetings. There is an opportunity at each meeting 
for the committee to discuss matters privately with the auditor without 
management present. In addition, the chairman of the committee is 
in regular contact with the external audit partner to discuss matters 
relevant to the company. Details of the committee’s specific 
responsibilities and how the committee exercised those responsibilities 
are set out in the remainder of this report. The committee’s detailed 
terms of reference are available on the company’s website and these are 
reviewed annually and updated to reflect changes in the responsibility 
and regulation of the committee, including as a result of regulatory 
changes. In addition, the committee conducts a review of its own 
performance on an annual basis, taking input from the members 
of the committee, the external auditor and senior members of the 
finance function, and assesses developments made over the course 
of the year and where improvements might be made in future.
Financial statements and audit
Before the start of the audit cycle, the committee reviewed the 
audit plan presented by the external auditor and agreed the scope 
of the audit work. In reviewing the financial statements the 
committee reviewed the accounting policies to ensure consistency 
on a year-to-year basis and across the group, and the methods used 
to account for significant or unusual transactions. Significant issues 
that the committee addressed in relation to the financial statements 
are set out in the table below. The committee also reviewed 
management’s attestation paper setting out the information that 
had been provided to the auditor to enable it to form its opinion on 
the group’s financial statements and demonstrating that it was 
appropriate for the directors to make the representations set out 
in the letter of representation. 
“I am pleased to introduce our audit committee report for 2014/15. 
The committee provides support to the board in performing its duties and, 
in particular, has responsibility for monitoring the integrity of the group’s 
financial reporting, internal controls and risk management procedures.”

REPORT OF THE AUDIT COMMITTEE CONTINUED
Significant issues considered by the audit committee in relation to the financial statements for 2014/15
Matter considered What the committee did
Uncertain tax positions A detailed review of several uncertain tax positions, which have not yet been agreed or are 
in dispute with HMRC, was undertaken by the committee. The current status of each item 
was noted by the committee and consideration was given to the views of the group’s specialist 
advisers as to the most likely outcome for each. Particular attention was paid to the largest 
of these, an internal funding arrangement undertaken in 2003/4, known as Sussex. The 
committee satisfied itself that appropriate provisions were in place in respect of the uncertain 
tax positions following discussion with the external auditor and, in particular, that the increase 
in the year was appropriate. 
Impairment of property, plant 
and equipment and goodwill
The committee considered two detailed reports, prepared by management, concerning the 
methodology used to determine the extent of any impairment required. Questions raised by 
the committee included those over the underlying growth rates (and the changes thereto as 
applied to the retail estate), the discount rate and the process for review. The committee 
also questioned management’s reviews on a site by site basis and the expected timetable for 
disposals of non-core sites. Management’s proposals were also discussed with the external 
auditors and the committee took into account their views on the questions raised. Following 
the review and discussions the committee concluded that an impairment of £27 .4m was appropriate 
in relation to property, plant and equipment. As regards goodwill, it was determined that 
£2.9m should be written off in relation to disposals undertaken during the year.
Funding headroom and covenants The committee reviewed the group’s funding headroom and covenants in conjunction with 
the review of the use of the going concern assumption, and extended this to cover the enlarged 
group following the acquisition of Spirit Pub Company plc. As part of the review, the committee 
challenged management’s projections, assumptions and stress testing, as well as the extent 
to which mitigating actions would achieve the desired outcomes. The committee took into 
account the external auditor’s comments on its own work on this issue. 
Accounting for supplier income 
and customer rebates
In light of recent market awareness of the issue, the committee requested a specific 
review by the group’s internal audit function of the group’s accounting for supplier income, 
including listing fees, performance fees and volume rebates. The committee noted that 
the annual value of such fees and rebates amounted to approximately £12m, and that such 
income is not recognised until it can be reliably estimated. A separate report on customer 
rebates was also considered by the committee. Such rebates amounted to £20m in the year. 
The committee was satisfied that the current controls in place provided reasonable assurance 
that the risks associated with these areas are being appropriately managed. On the 
recommendation of the internal audit function, the committee requested that 
enhanced documentation be maintained.
Effectiveness of external audit 
After the 2013/14 audit was completed a review of the effectiveness 
of the auditor and of the audit service was undertaken, supported 
by a questionnaire completed by the audit committee chairman, 
the interim finance director, and a number of key members of the 
finance team involved in the preparation of the statutory accounts. 
The overall quality of the service, the audit partner and the audit 
team were all reviewed and matters such as the management of the 
audit team, the quality of its challenge, insight and communications 
and the cost-effectiveness of the audit were considered. Taking into 
account the internal review and the outcome of the Financial 
Reporting Council’s (FRC) Audit Quality Review Team’s review 
of Ernst & Young the committee was satisfied that the quality 
of the audit service provided by Ernst & Young was appropriate. 
The feedback from the review was also provided to Ernst & Young. 
The maintenance of audit independence was also considered 
and is covered in more detail below.
Ensuring external auditor independence
The audit committee is cognisant of the importance of auditor 
independence and objectivity and accordingly has an established 
policy in relation to the use of the auditor for non-audit work. 
The company will award non-audit work to the firm which provides 
the best commercial solution for the work in question, taking into 
account the skills and experience of the firm and (if the audit firm 
is being considered) the nature of the services involved, the level 
of fees relative to the audit fee and whether there are safeguards in 
place to mitigate to an acceptable level any threat to objectivity and 
independence in the conduct of the audit resulting from such services. 
Work estimated to cost in excess of £25,000 is put out to tender 
unless agreed otherwise by the chairman of the audit committee. 
The finance director may approve specific engagements up to 
£50,000 (in aggregate up to £100,000 p.a.), and the chairman of 
the audit committee may approve engagements up to £100,000 
(in aggregate up to £200,000 p.a.), with fees in excess of those 
limits being subject to approval of the full committee. 
During the year the company made use of specialist teams within 
Ernst & Young for non-audit work. Taxation advisory support was 
provided until 31 July 2014, in relation to tax matters on which 
Ernst & Young specialists had originally advised. 
Ernst & Young were also appointed as reporting accountants on the 
acquisition of Spirit Pub Company plc. This is a role conventionally 
performed by the auditor. The board considered the appropriateness of 
appointing Ernst & Young for this work and the risks to Ernst & Young’s 
independence and the committee assessed the steps taken by Ernst 
& Young to ensure the continuing independence of the audit partner 
and audit team. The board then concluded that there were significant 
benefits of using Ernst & Young, including the ability to proceed 
quickly, added efficiency from existing knowledge of the company, 
and tighter confidentiality by minimising the number of parties involved. 
Thus the board approved the appointment of Ernst & Young to the 
role of reporting accountants to this acquisition. This resulted in a 
high ratio of non-audit fees to audit fees. However the committee 
has noted that this level of fee is not material to Ernst & Young, and 
is not likely to recur regularly. The total fees paid to Ernst & Young 
during the year amounted to £1.63m, of which £1.30m related 
to non-audit work.  Annual report 2015 GREENE KING PLC 45
Corporate governance Strategic report Financial statements Shareholder information
The committee has in place a policy in relation to the appointment of 
former partners or employees of the auditor by the group. The policy 
provides that audit partners will not be offered employment by 
Greene King or any of its subsidiary undertakings within two years 
of undertaking any role on the audit. Other key team members will 
not be offered employment by Greene King within six months of 
undertaking any role on the audit. Other audit team members who 
accept employment by Greene King must cease activity on the audit 
immediately they tender their resignation to the audit firm. No 
members of the audit team have joined Greene King in the period.
External auditor – tendering and re-appointment
The company last tendered the external audit contract in 1997 and 
Ernst & Young have been the auditor since then, with an annual 
rolling contract and subject to an annual shareholder vote at the 
AGM. Ernst & Young are required to rotate the audit partner 
responsible for the group every five years and the current audit 
partner’s term will end after the 2015/16 audit. The committee 
continues to monitor legislative and best practice changes in this 
area. It remains the board’s intention to put the audit of the group 
and subsidiary accounts out to tender with a view to any change 
taking effect for the 2016/17 statutory accounts, to coincide with 
the end of the current audit partner’s five-year term. 
The board, however, will consider the implications of the transitional 
provisions in the EU and Competition and Markets Authority 
regulation on audit matters, which would allow a further period until 
April 2024 before an audit tender and change would be required. 
In light of the assessment described above, the committee was satisfied 
that auditor independence and objectivity was safeguarded and that 
it was appropriate to recommend to the board Ernst & Young’s 
re-appointment as auditor. This resolution will be put to 
shareholders at the AGM. 
Internal audit
The committee reviewed the company’s internal audit function, 
which, during the year, extended its remit to cover central functions 
as well as the group’s Retail division. Under the terms of reference 
for the function, the internal audit team has direct access to the 
audit committee chairman to enable it to raise any significant 
issues. Members of the internal audit team also attend the audit 
committee meetings to report on the progress and actions taken by 
the function. During the year, the internal audit function reported 
to the committee on a number of areas making recommendations 
for improvements in a number of areas, including supplier income, 
customer rebates and free trade loans. 
Other matters
The committee reviewed, as it does on an annual basis, the group’s 
whistle blowing policy and its application across the business. 
All whistle blowing reports were investigated and resolved 
satisfactorily, with no significant issues emerging.
The committee has continued to review the issue of cyber security 
and receives regular reports from the internal data governance 
committee with additional continuing dialogue when threats are 
identified. In addition, the committee reviewed the company’s 
hedging strategy and use of derivatives including the accounting 
for derivatives.
The terms of reference of the committee were also reviewed during 
the year and an exercise was undertaken to assess the effectiveness 
of the audit committee itself. 
The company completed the acquisition of Spirit Pub Company plc 
following the year end. The audit committee is mindful that there 
will be extensive work undertaken during the integration of the 
business and this will be one of the focuses of the committee during 
the 2015/16 financial year. 
Internal control and risk management
The board has overall responsibility for the group’s risk 
management framework and systems of internal control and for 
reviewing their effectiveness, whilst the audit committee monitors 
and reviews those internal controls and risks on a regular basis, and 
reports to the board on its findings. During the course of the year 
the committee reviewed in detail reports from a number of business 
units and functional areas on their respective risk management 
processes and key risks. Representatives of the relevant business 
unit or functional area attended those meetings to present the 
reports and answer questions from the committee. 
A summary of the risk management framework is set out on page 28. 
The risk management framework and internal control systems are 
designed to manage to an acceptable level, and not to eliminate, the 
risk of failure to achieve business objectives. They can provide reasonable, 
but not absolute, assurance that the group’s assets are safeguarded 
and that the financial information used within the business and 
for external reporting is reliable. 
The company has in place procedures to assess the key risks to which it 
is exposed and has formalised the control environment needed to address 
these and other issues. There are processes in place which accord with the 
Financial Reporting Council’s Internal Control: Guidance to Directors, 
and these remained in place up to the date of this report. The board is 
satisfied that there are no significant weaknesses in these systems and 
that the group’s internal controls are operating effectively. The committee 
acknowledges that the FRC’s Guidance on Risk Management, Internal 
Control and Related Financial and Business Reporting will replace 
the Internal Control: Guidance to Directors for the forthcoming year 
and will work with management to ensure compliance.
The key elements of the internal control framework are:
 – the schedule of matters reserved for the board;
 – the group’s defined management structure with suitable authority 
limits and responsibilities, staffed by appropriate personnel;
 – regular updates for the board on strategy;
 – a comprehensive planning and financial reporting procedure 
including annual budgets and a three-year strategic plan, both 
of which are reviewed and approved by the board; 
 – ongoing monitoring by both the board and senior management of 
performance against budgets, through the periodic reporting of 
detailed management accounts and key performance indicators;
 – ongoing monitoring by the board of compliance with 
financial covenants;
 – a centralised financial reporting system and close process, 
with controls and reconciliation procedures designed to facilitate 
the production of the consolidated accounts; 
 – clearly defined evaluation and approval processes for acquisitions 
and disposals, capital expenditure and project control, with 
escalating levels of authority (including board approval for major 
acquisitions and disposals), detailed appraisal and review 
procedures and post-completion reviews;
 – review of retail operational compliance by the retail internal 
audit team responsible and other analytical and control 
procedures facilitated by the EPOS till system;
 – audits conducted by the group internal audit function of business 
and functional control environments; and
 – documented policies to cover bribery and whistle blowing 
and regular updates on any incidents. 
The previous group finance director stepped down from the board 
in September 2014 following a period of extended leave of absence 
for health reasons. The audit committee was satisfied that the 
arrangements put in place during his absence ensured the continued 
appropriate leadership of the finance function and maintained 
effective levels of internal control. Kirk Davis was appointed 
chief financial officer in November 2014. GREENE KING PLC Annual report 2015 46

DIRECTORS’ REMUNERATION REPORT
Shareholders approved the remuneration policy for the company’s 
directors at the 2014 AGM, and this will apply until replaced by a new 
or amended policy. In line with the new regulations on directors’ 
remuneration, the company will submit its policy to shareholders 
for approval once every three years, unless circumstances dictate 
otherwise. The remuneration committee is of the view that the policy 
continues to remain appropriate and should therefore continue to 
operate for 2015/16. Whilst the policy is not required to be presented 
this year, it has been set out in full in this report to assist you in 
reviewing the implementation of the policy in the 2014/15 financial 
year, details of which are set out in the annual report on remuneration 
on pages 50 to 57 . This latter report is subject to an advisory shareholder 
vote at the forthcoming AGM.
The committee remains mindful of the need to ensure that remuneration 
policies and practices at Greene King drive behaviour that is in the 
long-term interests of the company and its shareholders.
Pay for performance
Bonus payouts for this year were 60% of salary for the chief executive 
and 74% of salary for the chief financial officer (pro-rated for time 
served to 37%), reflecting the very stretching targets set at the beginning 
of the year. The long-term incentive plan (LTIP), however, will vest 
in August this year at 100%. This is as a result of the company 
exceeding the adjusted free cash flow (accounting for 60% of the 
award) and EPS (accounting for 40% of the award) targets that 
were set by the remuneration committee in 2012. 
Going forward
We continue to exercise restraint in executive pay levels and, 
notwithstanding the significant changes facing the business, executive 
directors will receive base salary increases of 2.5% for this year. 
Other benefits, including pension provision, will be maintained at 
existing levels or by reference to percentages of base salary as applicable.
As a clear focus of attention for the company will be the integration 
of the Spirit Pub Company plc (Spirit) business and recognising the 
importance of achieving the synergy targets, the annual bonus 
targets for the executive directors for 2015/16 will include a specific 
synergy target. The LTIP will continue to be based on EPS and 
ROCE targets and, while they do not take into account the potential 
impact of the Spirit Pub Company acquisition at this stage, given 
that it has only very recently completed, the committee will review 
what changes may be needed to those targets in due course. 
Further, given the significant changes to the size and complexity of 
the group as a result of the Spirit acquisition, the committee intends 
to review the executive director base salary levels and other elements of 
the company’s directors’ remuneration policy during the forthcoming 
year. Major shareholders will be consulted if appropriate and any 
formal shareholder approval will be sought if necessary at next 
year’s AGM.
Consistent with our aim of promoting share ownership widely 
across the company, we are putting forward at the AGM proposals 
for a new save as you earn scheme, for all employees of the group, 
to replace the existing scheme which expires this year. 
We are happy to receive feedback from shareholders at any time 
in relation to our remuneration policies and hope to receive your 
support for the resolution referred to above at the forthcoming AGM.

POLICY REPORT
This section of the report sets out Greene King’s future remuneration 
policy. Details of actual remuneration paid, LTIP awards made and 
the associated performance conditions are set out in the annual report 
on remuneration which starts on page 50. This policy report was 
put to a shareholder vote at the 2014 AGM and approved by 96% 
of shareholders who voted. There is no requirement to vote on the 
policy this year, and the policy is set out below for information only. 
Policy overview
The key objective of the company’s remuneration policy is to 
provide a remuneration structure that is aligned with shareholder 
interests and that enables us to attract, motivate and retain talented 
and high quality individuals able to deliver continued growth of the 
business and achieve the group’s strategic aims. The remuneration 
package is designed to be competitive but not excessive and to contain 
an appropriate balance between fixed and variable remuneration 
and, for the variable remuneration, between short-term and 
longer-term performance. 
The committee has considered whether there are any aspects of 
the policy which could inadvertently encourage executives to take 
inappropriate risk and is satisfied that this is not the case. The committee 
has also ensured that the incentive structure for executive directors and 
senior management does not raise environmental, social or governance 
risks by inadvertently motivating irresponsible behaviour.
Details of each element of remuneration, their purpose, link to strategy 
and their operation and performance metrics are set out below.
Policy table
Element of remuneration Purpose and link to strategy Operation Maximum opportunity Performance metrics
Salary To recruit, reward 
and retain high calibre 
executives with 
an appropriately 
competitive base salary.
Base salaries are reviewed annually 
or when a change in responsibility 
occurs, to reflect the executive’s 
responsibilities, market value 
and sustained performance level. 
In setting pay levels, the committee 
considers current market practice 
and makes comparisons against 
a selection of other companies 
determined by reference to 
turnover, market capitalisation 
and operational details. 
When reviewing base salaries, 
the committee is mindful of the 
gearing effect that increases in 
base salary will have on the 
potential total remuneration 
of the executive directors.
There is no prescribed 
maximum annual 
increase. The committee 
is guided by the general 
increase for the broader 
employee population but 
on occasions may need to 
recognise, for example, 
an increase in the scale, 
scope or responsibility 
of the role.
—
Annual 
performance  
bonus 
To incentivise executive 
directors to deliver 
superior performance 
during the course of a 
year, and to promote 
retention and stability 
amongst the senior 
management team. 
Performance measures 
and targets are designed 
to reinforce strategic 
priorities for the year.
Performance measures and 
targets are set at the beginning 
of each financial year to ensure 
that the measures and weightings 
are appropriate and support 
the business strategy. Bonuses 
are payable after the end of 
each financial year, based 
on performance against 
those targets. Bonuses are 
non-pensionable. A clawback 
mechanism applies in 
the event of a material 
misstatement of the 
group’s accounts, error 
or gross misconduct. 
A maximum of 100% of 
salary can be earned by 
the executive directors, 
with no bonus payable 
for below threshold 
performance and up to 
75% of salary for target 
levels of performance. 
Payment of bonuses is 
dependent on a mixture 
of financial targets and 
specific personal targets. 
In relation to the financial 
targets, awards are made 
on a straight-line basis for 
performance between 
threshold and target and 
on a separate straight-line 
basis for performance 
between target 
and maximum.
Performance is measured 
relative to challenging 
targets in key financial 
measures. Details of 
measures and weightings 
for the 2014/15 financial 
year and of the proposed 
measures and weightings 
for next year’s annual 
bonus, are set out in 
the annual report on 
remuneration which starts 
on page 50. An explanation 
of how the performance 
measures were chosen 
is given in the notes 
on the next page. GREENE KING PLC Annual report 2015 48

DIRECTORS’ REMUNERATION REPORT CONTINUED
Element of remuneration Purpose and link to strategy Operation Maximum opportunity Performance metrics
Long-term 
incentive plan 
(LTIP)
To incentivise the 
executive directors to 
deliver superior levels 
of long-term performance 
for the benefit of 
shareholders, thereby 
aligning their interests 
with those of our 
long-term shareholders.
The committee normally makes 
an annual LTIP award, usually 
in the form of nil-cost options. 
The awards are subject to suitably 
stretching performance conditions 
set by the committee, which are 
reviewed annually. Awards 
normally vest on the third 
anniversary of grant, subject 
to performance, and will be 
exercisable until the tenth 
anniversary of grant. A clawback 
mechanism applies in the event 
of a material misstatement 
of the group’s accounts, error 
or gross misconduct. 
A maximum of 200% of 
salary can be awarded 
each year, 100% as a core 
LTIP and 100% as a 
growth LTIP. Dividend 
equivalents will be paid 
on any shares that vest. 
The core LTIP will 
be subject to a suitably 
stretching EPS target 
and the growth LTIP to a 
suitably stretching ROCE 
target. Performance will 
normally be measured over 
a three year period. Vesting 
will generally be subject 
to continued employment. 
The committee retains 
the discretion to scale back 
the vesting levels of the 
growth LTIP award in 
appropriate circumstances. 
Shareholding 
policy
To align the interests 
of the executive directors 
with shareholders 
and to promote a 
long-term approach.
Executive directors are 
required to build and retain 
a shareholding of at least 100% 
of salary. To the extent that the 
shareholding requirement has 
not been met, executives will be 
expected to retain at least 50% 
of the net exercised LTIP awards 
until the requirement is met.
Pension To offer market competitive 
levels of benefit.
The company contributes to 
defined contribution pension 
arrangements for the executive 
directors or provides cash in lieu 
where appropriate.
Current company 
contribution levels 
are 25% for the 
chief executive and 
20% for the chief 
financial officer.
—
Benefits To be appropriately 
competitive with those 
offered at comparator 
companies.
Benefits comprise the provision 
of company cars (or cash 
allowances in lieu thereof), fuel 
for company cars, life assurance, 
permanent health insurance 
and private medical insurance. 
Benefits are reviewed 
periodically in line 
with market practice 
and are not pensionable.
—
All-employee 
share schemes
All employees, including 
executive directors, have 
the opportunity to build 
their shareholding in 
a tax-efficient way by 
participating in the 
company’s HMRC 
approved sharesave 
scheme.
Employees are invited 
to participate in the sharesave in 
January each year provided that 
they have the requisite service.
The maximum saving 
under the sharesave 
scheme will be no more 
than HMRC approved 
limits, allowing employees 
to buy company shares 
at up to a 20% discount 
at the end of a three or 
five-year savings period.

Notes:
1.  A description of how the company intends to implement the policy set out in 
this table for 2015/16 is set out in the annual report on remuneration which 
starts on page 50.
2.  The choice of performance metrics applicable to the annual bonus scheme 
reflect the committee’s belief that the compensation should be appropriately 
stretching, but achievable, and tied to both the delivery of profit growth, key 
financial metrics and specific individual objectives. 
3.  The EPS performance condition underpinning the core LTIP award was selected 
by the committee on the basis that it would reward the delivery of long-term 
financial growth and is the most widely understood profit-based measure across 
the business. ROCE was chosen as the performance condition to apply to the 
growth LTIP award as it will ensure that management focuses on generating 
the necessary returns in excess of the cost of capital and because it provides 
a more strategic measure of long term performance, where capital needs to 
be re-deployed in order to focus on Retail. The performance targets are set 
by the committee following a detailed review of the company’s projections 
and are believed to be appropriately stretching.
4.  The policy and practice for the remuneration of employees generally differs 
from that for the executive directors as follows:
 – A lower level of maximum annual bonus opportunity (or zero bonus opportunity) 
may apply to employees other than the executive directors and certain 
senior executives and targets may differ by business unit and by employee.
 – Other employees may receive fewer or lower levels of benefits than those 
for executive directors. Company car benefits are only offered where 
required for the role or to meet market norms.
 – Pension contribution levels may be lower for employees generally compared 
with those for the executive directors.
 – Participation in the core LTIP is limited to the executive directors and 
around 40 senior managers. Participation in the growth LTIP is limited 
to an even smaller senior management population.
  These differences generally arise from the development of remuneration 
arrangements that are market competitive for various categories of employees. 
They also reflect the fact that, in the case of executive directors and senior 
executives, there is a greater emphasis on performance related pay. 
5.  Subject to the achievement of the applicable performance conditions, executive 
directors are eligible to receive payment from any award made prior to the 
approval and implementation of the remuneration policy detailed in this report.

Notes:
1.  Minimum relates to the value of the package assuming that salary, benefits 
and pension alone are paid. 
2.  The on-target annual bonus opportunity, based on stretching performance 
targets, is 75% of salary for the chief executive and 75% for the chief 
financial officer.
3.  The on-target vesting level under the core LTIP and the growth LTIP 
is assumed to be 50% and 50% respectively.
4.  The maximum scenario assumes full bonus payout and full vesting 
of LTIP awards. 
5.  No assumption as to share price growth is made in either the on-target 
or the maximum scenarios.
Approach to recruitment and promotions
The remuneration package for a new executive director would 
be set in accordance with the terms of the company’s prevailing 
approved remuneration policy at the time of recruitment. In 
particular, the annual bonus potential will be limited to 100% of 
salary and awards under the LTIP will be limited to 200% of salary.
In the case of an external hire, if required to secure an individual, 
the committee may offer additional cash and or share-based 
elements when it considers them to be in the best interests of the 
company, to take account of deferred remuneration forfeited by the 
new hire when leaving their former employer. Any such additional 
payments would be one-off in nature, would reflect where possible 
the nature, time horizons and performance requirements attaching 
to that forfeited remuneration and would be limited to the value 
of the forfeited remuneration.
For an internal promotion to executive director level, any variable 
pay element awarded in respect of the prior role may be allowed to 
pay out in accordance with its terms, adjusted as relevant to take 
into account the appointment. In addition, any other ongoing 
remuneration obligations existing prior to appointment may 
continue, provided that they are put to shareholders for approval 
at the earliest opportunity. 
For both external and internal appointments, the committee may 
agree that the company may meet certain relocation and/or 
incidental expenses as appropriate.
Service agreements and exit payment policy
Newly appointed executive directors are offered a service agreement 
with a notice period of one year. In the event of the employment of 
an executive director being terminated, the committee would take 
into account the commercial interests of the company, pay due regard 
to best practice and apply usual common law and contractual 
principles, including the individual’s duty to mitigate their loss.
The payment of any annual bonus in respect of the year of 
termination is subject to the discretion of the committee, which 
may determine that an annual bonus is payable with respect to the 
period of the financial year served, but pro-rated for time served, 
and not paid until the normal due date for the payment of bonuses. 
The vesting of any LTIP awards will be governed by the rules 
of the LTIP. Awards will normally lapse unless the individual 
is considered a ‘good leaver’. An individual would generally be 
considered a ‘good leaver’ if they left the group’s employment 
by reason of death, injury, ill health, disability approved by the 
committee, or retirement, although the committee has the absolute 
discretion to treat any individual as a ‘good leaver’ for any other 
reason. In the case of a ‘good leaver’, payments would normally 
be scaled back to recognise the shorter period of service than the 
award was intended to cover and remain subject to outstanding 
performance conditions. 
Rooney Anand, whose employment with the company commenced 
on 6 August 2001, is subject to a one-year notice period from the 
company. His terms of employment do not contain any additional 
terms relating to compensation for termination of employment. 
The terms of his appointment as chief executive were agreed and 
set out in a letter dated 24 December 2004.
Kirk Davis’s employment, which commenced on 3 November 2014, 
is subject to the terms of a contract dated 29 September 2014. 
His employment may be terminated by the company on giving one 
year’s notice, without any additional terms relating to compensation 
for termination of employment.
There are no obligations on the company contained within the 
existing directors’ contracts which would give rise to payments 
not disclosed in this report.

Fee To recruit and retain 
appropriately qualified 
non-executive directors.
The chairman and non-executive 
director fees are typically 
reviewed every two years. Fees 
are benchmarked against similar 
roles in the sector and in other 
similar sized companies and 
reflect the time commitments 
and responsibilities of each role.
Non-executive director 
fees may include a basic 
fee and a fee for acting 
as a committee chairman. 
They are set at a level that 
is considered appropriately 
competitive in the light 
of market practice.

The value of the 
chairman’s benefits 
will be comparable with 
those offered to the 
executive directors.

External directorships
The company’s policy is to allow executive directors to take up one or more non-executive directorships in an external company, subject 
to board approval. Fees received for serving as a non-executive director of an external company are retained by the executive director. 
Consultation
The company engages regularly with shareholders on matters relating to its strategy and business operations. Where necessary, we also 
engage with shareholders and their representative bodies on matters relating to executive remuneration and it is the committee’s policy 
to consult with major shareholders prior to making any major changes to its executive remuneration structure. 
Consideration of conditions elsewhere in the group
The committee does not consult with employees when deciding remuneration policy, although it does receive information on salary 
increases and long-term incentives for employees across the group. 
ANNUAL REPORT ON REMUNERATION
This section of the report explains how Greene King’s remuneration policy has been implemented during the year.
The remuneration committee
The remuneration committee is appointed by the board. The members are Lynne Weedall (chairman), Mike Coupe, and Ian Durant. 
John Brady was a member of the committee until his retirement in July 2014 and, following the year end, Rob Rowley was appointed 
as an additional member of the committee on 5 May 2015. All of the committee members are regarded by the board as independent 
non-executive directors. 
The role of the committee, as set out in its terms of reference (which are available on the company’s website), includes determining the 
remuneration policy for the executive directors, the chairman and certain members of senior management. It agrees total individual 
remuneration packages, considers the granting of awards under the long-term incentive plan and determines bonuses payable to the 
executive directors and certain senior executives.
It approves the service contracts of the executive directors and any compensation arrangements arising from their termination. 
The committee is made aware of, and takes into account, the salary levels of the wider senior management team and of the incentive 
arrangements operating throughout the company.
During the year there were three scheduled meetings of the committee. Attendance at these meetings is shown in the table on page 40.
Advisers to the remuneration committee
The committee seeks advice on general remuneration matters and comparator information from New Bridge Street, part of Aon plc. 
Aon plc provides insurance broking and consultancy services to the group. The committee is satisfied that the provision of these services 
does not in any way prejudice the position of New Bridge Street as independent advisers to the committee. Fees paid during the year 
to New Bridge Street in respect of advice to the committee were £23k. 
Rooney Anand, chief executive, attends meetings of the committee and provides advice to help the committee determine appropriate 
remuneration and incentive packages for the finance director and the other senior executives, but he leaves the meeting when his own 
remuneration is being discussed. The chairman of the board also attends meetings of the committee. Annual report 2015 GREENE KING PLC 51

Notes:
1.  Pension benefits for the executive directors comprised cash in lieu of pension contributions.
2.  Long-term incentives in 2014/15 comprised the value of the awards granted in August 2012, which will vest in August 2015 and which were subject to performance 
targets measured over the three years to May 2015. The value of the award has been calculated using 849p, being the average share price for the last three months 
of the 2014/15 financial year, and also takes into account the dividend equivalent payable on the award. 100% vesting of the 2012 awards has been assumed. For the 
long-term incentives in 2013/14 the actual share price on the date of vesting has been used (restated from the estimated value of £1,422 disclosed in the 2013/14 report). 
The original value of Rooney Anand’s 2012 and 2011 awards were £700k and £684k respectively. The remaining value of the awards has resulted from the share price 
growth and dividend equivalent payments from which all shareholders have benefited.

Matthew Fearn’s base salary was £348,000. The base fee for the chairman was £174,250, whilst the base fees for the non-executive directors 
were £44,100 for John Brady, Mike Coupe and Rob Rowley and £51,250 for Ian Durant and Lynne Weedall (due to their roles as chairmen

Taxable benefits
Taxable benefits were provided to directors in line with the policy table set out on page 48.
Pension-related benefits
Cash in lieu of pension contributions were in line with the policy table set out on page 48.
Annual bonus
Executive directors may earn bonuses depending on the company’s performance and their own individual performance. Awards for 
the chief executive were based 90% on financial performance and 10% on individual performance, whilst for the chief financial officer 
the respective percentages were 65% on financial performance and 35% on individual performance.
For the chief executive, the financial performance measures were based on PBTE and free cash flow, whilst the chief financial officer had 
an additional financial target based on return on investments. The committee has decided that it will not disclose specific short-term financial 
targets as these are still considered to be commercially sensitive although they will be disclosed next year. Both PBTE and free cash flow 
are among the group’s KPIs, details of which are on page 27. 
The awards to be made are as follows:

decided at the discretion of the committee.
2.   The personal targets for Kirk Davis included targets relating to corporate reputation and certain financial targets which have not been disclosed on grounds 
of commercial sensitivity.
Performance against the combined financial and individual targets resulted in bonuses being paid at £332k (60% of salary) for the chief executive 
and at £118k (74% of salary pro-rated down to 37% for six months’ service) for the chief financial officer. No bonus was paid to Matthew Fearn 
in respect of his term as chief financial officer during the year.
Disclosure of 2013/14 bonus targets

Long-term incentive plans
The LTIP award granted on 6 August 2012 was based on a three year performance period ended 3 May 2015. A maximum of 60% of each 
award vests if an adjusted free cash flow target has been met and the remaining 40% vests if an EPS target has been met. The target ranges, 
calculated on a straight-line basis from 0% to 100%, are set out below.

Notes:
1.  The earnings per share target was adjusted last year to take account of the disposal of 275 pubs which completed in June 2014. The prior target range was 56.4p–64.4p. 
The committee is satisfied that the adjustment was appropriate and that the revised target was a fairer measure of performance and was no more or less difficult to achieve 
than the previous range.

Notes:
1.  The estimated value of the vested shares is based on the average share price during the three months to 3 May 2015 (849 pence). As explained in the single remuneration 
table above, a significant proportion of the estimated value of the LTIP award derives from the increase in the share price from which all shareholders have benefited.
2.  The LTIP enables award holders to benefit from the payment of dividend equivalents but only to the extent that the underlying share awards vest.
3.  Matthew Fearn’s LTIP award was pro-rated to reflect time served prior to his departure from the company.
Board changes – chief financial officer
Matthew Fearn stepped down from the board and from his role as chief financial officer on 29 September 2014 in order to focus on his 
health. He will remain an employee of the company until 24 August 2016 (‘date of cessation’). During that time he will not be entitled 
to any remuneration other than as set out below and will not be required to perform any work for the company. 
In accordance with the company’s remuneration policy, an amount equal to £234,802 was paid to Matthew Fearn based on six months’ 
salary, the value of his company car and the anticipated cost of private medical cover until his date of cessation. The company also maintained 
Matthew’s private medical insurance cover until he was able to procure alternative cover on comparable terms at his own cost.
Life assurance cover will be provided until the date of cessation and any permanent health insurance payments will not be paid until after 
the date of cessation. The company also agreed to pay £15,650 plus VAT towards the costs of Matthew’s legal fees incurred in connection 
with the agreement.
No payments in respect of annual bonus for the 2014/15 or any future financial years was or will be paid.

in accordance with the company’s remuneration policy, is as follows:

The committee is mindful of the potential impact of the recent acquisition of Spirit on the existing targets and will consider, during the course 
of this year, whether any adjustments should be made to the targets as a result. Details of any adjustments will be disclosed in next year’s report.

Annual bonus
The annual bonus opportunity will remain unchanged for 2015/16. The chief executive’s financial performance targets will continue to be 
based primarily on group PBTE (although the weighting of this will be reduced from 75% to 62.5%) and free cash flow (maximum weighting 
remains at 15%). In addition the chief executive will have a financial target relating to the achievement of synergies from the acquisition 
of Spirit Pub Company plc (maximum weighting 12.5%) and a further 10% of his bonus will be based on individual targets relating 
to succession planning. 
The chief financial officer’s main financial performance targets will be based on PBTE (maximum weighting 50%) and free cash flow 
(maximum weighting 12.5%). There will also be a financial target relating to the achievement of synergies from the acquisition of Spirit 
(maximum weighting 12.5%) and two other individual targets (maximum weighting 25%) which are commercially sensitive. 
The committee has decided that the bonus targets should not be disclosed prospectively due to commercial sensitivity. The committee expects 
to publish the performance targets once they have ceased to be commercially sensitive, in the 2016/17 annual report.
LTIP
The awards to be made in 2015 will be based on 200% of the executive director’s base salary (100% for the core LTIP and 100% for the 
growth LTIP), calculated by reference to the average closing prices on the three business days immediately prior to the date of the award. 
The awards will vest three years after the date of the award, subject to continued employment within the group and dependent on 
performance over the three financial years to May 2018. There will be no vesting under the core LTIP award for EPS growth (from a base 
of 61.0p) of 7.5% or less, increasing on a straight-line basis to full vesting for growth of 16.5%. For the growth LTIP award, there will be no 
vesting for ROCE of 9.2% or less, increasing on a straight-line basis to full vesting for ROCE of 9.7%. The committee retains the discretion 
to scale back the vesting levels of the growth LTIP awards in appropriate circumstances. 
These targets were set without taking into account the potential impact of the recent acquisition of Spirit Pub Company plc. The committee 
will consider, during the course of this year, whether any adjustments should be made to the targets as a result thereof and details of any 
adjustments will be disclosed in next year’s report.
Chairman and non-executive directors’ fees
The fees payable to the chairman and the non-executive directors in 2015/16 are as set out below. There will be no changes to the benefits 
receivable by the chairman. Fees for the chairman and the non-executive directors will be reviewed again in 2016 in the light of the recent

Share capital
Details of the authorised and issued share capital of the company, 
which comprises a single class of shares, ordinary shares of 12½p, 
are set out in note 25 to the accounts. The rights attaching to the 
shares are set out in the articles of association. There are no special 
control rights in relation to the company’s shares and the company 
is not aware of any agreements between holders of securities that 
may result in restrictions on the transfer of securities or on 
voting rights.
A total of 668k ordinary shares, with an aggregate nominal value of 
£83.5k were allotted, for cash, during the period in connection with 
the company’s sharesave and executive option schemes. In addition 
a further 111k shares were acquired by the company to satisfy 
awards under the company’s deferred share option scheme.
The company makes regular use of the employee benefit trust 
(EBT) to satisfy the exercise of share options and will make market 
purchases of the company’s shares from time to time to ensure that 
it has sufficient shares to enable it to do so. During July 2014, the 
EBT purchased a total of 500k shares at a total price of £4.206m. 
The average share price was 841.1p per share.
Purchase of own shares
In accordance with the company’s articles of association, authority 
was sought at the last AGM to purchase up to 10% of the company’s 
shares in issue as at 21 July 2014. The authority, which has not been 
exercised, was approved and remains exercisable until the next 
annual general meeting or 8 February 2017, whichever is earlier. 
The directors have again sought approval for the authority 
to purchase the company’s own shares.
Allotment of shares
In connection with the proposed acquisition of Spirit Pub Company plc, 
on 13 January 2015, at a general meeting of the company and pursuant 
to section 551 of the Companies Act 2006, the shareholders approved 
the authority of the directors to allot shares up to an aggregate 
nominal value of £11.25m. This authority, which is in addition to 
the authority to allot shares granted at the last AGM, shall expire 
on 31 December 2015.
Voting rights
In a general meeting of the company, on a show of hands, every 
member who is present in person or by proxy and entitled to vote 
shall have one vote. On a poll every member who is present in 
person or by proxy shall have one vote for every share of which they 
are the holder. The AGM notice gives full details of deadlines for 
exercising voting rights in respect of resolutions to be considered 
at the meeting.
No voting rights will be exercised in respect of any own shares held 
by the company.
Transfer of shares
There are no restrictions on the transfer of shares in the company 
other than those which may from time to time be applicable under 
existing laws and regulations (for example under the Market 
Abuse Directive). 
In addition, pursuant to the Listing Rules of the Financial Conduct 
Authority, directors of the company and persons discharging 
managerial responsibility are required to obtain prior approval 
from the company to deal in the company’s securities, and are 
prohibited from dealing during closed periods. Annual report 2015 GREENE KING PLC 59
Corporate governance Strategic report Financial statements Shareholder information
Change of control
All of the company’s share incentive plans contain provisions 
relating to a change of control and full details of these plans are 
provided in the directors’ remuneration report. Outstanding 
options and awards would normally vest and become exercisable 
on a change of control, subject to the satisfaction of performance 
conditions, if applicable, at that time.
The group’s banking facility agreements contain provisions entitling 
the counterparties to exercise termination or other rights in the 
event of a change of control. Certain of the company’s trading 
contracts also contain similar provisions.
There are two employees who, on a change of control of the company 
resulting in the termination of their employment, would be entitled 
to compensation for loss of office. However, in the context of the 
company as a whole, these agreements are de minimis.
Articles of association
The company’s articles of association may only be amended 
by special resolution at general meetings of shareholders. 
Appointment and replacement of directors
The number of directors on the board shall be no less than five 
nor more than twelve. Directors may be appointed by the company 
by ordinary resolution or by the board of directors. A director 
appointed by the board of directors holds office until the next 
following AGM, and is then eligible for election by the shareholders.
The articles provide that at each AGM all those directors who were 
elected, or last re-elected, at the AGM held in the third calendar 
year before the current year shall retire from office and may stand 
for re-election. In practice directors submit themselves for annual 
re-election in accordance with the provisions of the UK Corporate 
Governance Code.
The company may by ordinary resolution, of which special notice

DIRECTORS’ REPORT AND DISCLOSURES CONTINUED
Directors’ statement as to disclosure of information 
to the auditor
The directors who were members of the board at the time of 
approving the directors’ report are listed on page 37. Having made 
enquiries of fellow directors and of the company’s auditor, each 
of these directors confirms that:
 – to the best of each director’s knowledge and belief, there is no 
information relevant to the preparation of their report of which 
the company’s auditor is unaware; and
 – each director has taken all the steps a director might reasonably be 
expected to have taken to be aware of relevant audit information 
and to establish that the company’s auditor is aware of that information.
Going concern
The group’s business activities, together with the factors likely to 
affect its future development, performance and position, are set out 
in the chief executive’s review. The financial position of the group, 
its cash flows, liquidity position and borrowing facilities are described 
in the financial review. In addition, note 23 to the financial statements 
includes the group’s objectives, policies and processes for managing 
its capital; its financial risk management objectives; details of its 
financial instruments and hedging activities; and its exposure 
to credit and liquidity risk. 
The directors are of the opinion that the group’s forecast and 
projections, which take account of reasonably possible changes 
in trading performance, and its stress testing to take account of 
expected payments in respect of uncertain tax positions show that 
the group should be able to operate within its current borrowing 
facilities and comply with its financing covenants. 
After making enquiries, the directors have a reasonable expectation 
that the company and the group have adequate resources to continue 
in operational existence for the foreseeable future. Accordingly, 
they continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the 
annual report and financial statements.
Auditor
Ernst & Young LLP has expressed its willingness to continue 
in office and a resolution to re-appoint the firm as the company’s 
auditor will be proposed at the AGM.
Annual general meeting 
The AGM will be held at 12 noon on Tuesday 8 September 2015 at 
the Millennium Grandstand, Rowley Mile Racecourse Conference 
Centre, Newmarket, Suffolk. The notice of the AGM is set out 
in the separate circular to shareholders. 
The directors consider that all of the resolutions set out in the notice 
of AGM are in the best interests of the company and its shareholders as 
a whole. The directors will be voting in favour of them and unanimously 
recommend that shareholders vote in favour of each of them.

group for that period. In preparing those group financial statements 
the directors are required to:
 – select suitable accounting policies in accordance with IAS 8 
Accounting Policies, Changes in Accounting Estimates and 
Errors and then apply them consistently;
 – present information, including accounting policies, in a 
manner that provides relevant, reliable, comparable and

of the group and enable them to ensure that the group financial 
statements comply with the Companies Act 2006 and Article 4 
of the IAS Regulation. They are also responsible for safeguarding 
the assets of the group and hence for taking reasonable steps for

taken as a whole; 
 – that the annual report, including the strategic report, includes a 
fair review of the development and performance of the business 
and the position of the company and undertakings included in the 
consolidation taken as a whole, together with a description of the

 – having taken into account all matters considered by the board 
and brought to the attention of the board during the year, the 
directors consider that the annual report, taken as a whole, is fair, 
balanced and understandable. The directors believe that the 
disclosures set out in this annual report provide the information

INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORT (GROUP)
To the members of Greene King plc
We present our audit report on the group financial statements (as defined below) of Greene King plc, which comprise the group primary 
statements and related notes set out on pages 67 to 101. 
Opinion on financial statements 
In our opinion Greene King plc’s group financial statements: 
 – give a true and fair view of the state of the group’s affairs as at 3 May 2015 and of its profit for the year then ended; 
 – have been properly prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the European Union; and 
 – have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006 and Article 4 of the IAS Regulation. 
Overview
Materiality Overall group materiality of £7.8m (2014: £8.8m) which represents approximately 5% of pre-tax profit before 
exceptional items.
Audit scope We performed an audit of the complete financial information of all of the trading components and the corporate 
centre which together contribute to the group’s results for the year. 
We have obtained an understanding of the entity-level controls of the group which assisted us in identifying 
and assessing risks of material misstatement due to fraud or error, as well as assisting us in determining the most 
appropriate audit strategy.
Areas of focus Asset impairment considerations in relation to the trading estate and associated goodwill.
Risks relating to uncertain tax positions.
Funding headroom and compliance with debt covenants.
Revenue recognition in relation to beer and liquor sales and the associated retrospective discounts.
What has changed Our assessment of the above risks of material misstatement is consistent with the prior year.
Our application of materiality
The scope of our work is influenced by materiality. We apply the concept of materiality in planning and performing the audit, in evaluating 
the effect of identified misstatements on the audit and in forming our audit opinion.
As we develop our audit strategy, we determine materiality at the overall level and at the individual account level (referred to as our 
‘performance materiality’).
MATERIALITY 
£7.8m
PERFORMANCE MATERIALITY
£5.9m
REPORTING THRESHOLD 
£390k
Materiality
The magnitude of an omission or misstatement that, individually or in the aggregate, could reasonably be expected to influence the economic 
decisions of the users of the financial statements. 
We determined materiality for the group to be £7.8m (2014: £8.8m), which is approximately 5% (2014: 5%) of pre-tax profit before exceptional 
items. Our materiality amount provides a basis for determining the nature and extent of our risk assessment procedures, identifying and 
assessing the risk of material misstatement and determining the nature and extent of further audit procedures. Materiality is assessed on 
both quantitative and qualitative grounds. With respect to disclosure and presentational matters, amounts in excess of the quantitative 
thresholds above may not be adjusted if their effect is not considered to be material on a qualitative basis.
Rationale for basis
We used pre-tax profit before exceptional items of £168.5m because it is a key performance indicator used in communications with investors, 
it is more reflective of underlying trading profitability and it is a key metric used by the group in the assessment of the performance of 
management. We also note that market and analyst commentary on the group uses pre-tax profit before exceptional items as a key metric. 
Therefore, in our view, we consider that pre-tax profit before exceptional items to be the most appropriate performance metric on which 
to base our materiality calculation as we considered this to be the most relevant performance measure to the stakeholders of the group. 
This provided the basis for determining the nature, timing and extent of our audit procedures, and identifying and assessing the risk 
of material misstatement.
Performance materiality
The application of materiality at the individual account or balance level. It is set at an amount to reduce to an appropriately low level 
the probability that the aggregate of uncorrected and undetected misstatements exceeds materiality.
On the basis of our assessments of risk and the group’s overall control environment, our judgment was that overall performance 
materiality (i.e. our tolerance for misstatement in an individual account or balance) for the group should be 75% (2014: 75%) of planning 
materiality, namely £5.9m (2014: £6.6m), due to the low level of historic uncorrected misstatements. Our objective in adopting this approach 
was to ensure that the total of any detected (but unadjusted) and undetected audit differences was unlikely to exceed our assessment of 
materiality for the financial statements as a whole. Full scope audit procedures are completed for all trading divisions and the corporate 
centre which together contribute to the group’s results for the year. Audit work on individual components is undertaken using a percentage 
of our total performance materiality. This percentage is based on the size of the component relevant to the group as a whole and our 
assessment of risk of misstatement at that component. In the current period the range of performance materiality allocated 
to components was £2.3m to £5.3m. GREENE KING PLC Annual report 2015 64
Financial statements
INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORT (GROUP) CONTINUED
To the members of Greene King plc
Reporting threshold
An amount below which identified misstatements are considered as being clearly trivial.
We agreed with the audit committee that we would report to the committee all audit differences in excess of £390,000 (2014: £400,000), 
as well as differences below that threshold that, in our view, warranted reporting on qualitative grounds. We evaluate any uncorrected 
misstatements against both the quantitative measures of materiality discussed above and in the light of other relevant qualitative considerations.
Scope of the audit of the financial statements 
An audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements sufficient to give reasonable assurance 
that the financial statements are free from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or error. This includes an assessment of: 
whether the accounting policies are appropriate to the group’s circumstances and have been consistently applied and adequately disclosed; 
the reasonableness of significant accounting estimates made by the directors; and the overall presentation of the financial statements. 
In addition, we read all the financial and non-financial information in the annual report to identify material inconsistencies with the audited 
financial statements and to identify any information that is apparently materially incorrect based on, or materially inconsistent with, 
the knowledge acquired by us in the course of performing the audit. If we become aware of any apparent material misstatements 
or inconsistencies we consider the implications for our report. 
Tailoring the scope
Our assessment of audit risk, our evaluation of materiality and our allocation of performance materiality determine our audit scope for each 
entity within the group which, when taken together, enable us to form an opinion on the group financial statements under International 
Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland). We take into account size, risk profile, changes in the business environment and other factors 
when assessing the level of work to be performed at each entity.
The group’s operations are based solely in the United Kingdom and therefore all audit procedures are completed by one audit team based 
in the head office location working across both the group and subsidiary financial statement audits.
Our assessment of focus areas
We identify below the risks of material misstatement which had the greatest effect on the overall audit strategy; the allocation of resources 
in the audit; and directing the efforts of the engagement team. This is not a complete list of all the risks identified in our audit. We have also 
set out how we tailored our audit to address these specific areas in order to provide an opinion on the group financial statements as a whole 
and should be read in this context. This is not a complete list of all the procedures we performed in respect of these areas.
Changes from the prior year
Our audit approach and assessment of areas of focus changes in response to changes in circumstances affecting the Greene King business 
and impacting the group financial statements.
Our assessment of the risks of material misstatement below is consistent with the prior year. 
Area of focus How our audit addressed the area of focus
Asset impairment considerations in relation to the trading estate and associated goodwill
The group had property, plant and equipment 
balances of £2,235.4m relating to its trading 
estate and £700.9m of goodwill as at the 
period end.
For the trading estate, impairments are 
considered on a site by site basis when an 
impairment indicator has been identified 
through reduced profit performance. Goodwill 
is assessed at an operating segment level 
(i.e. Retail, Pub Partners and Brewing & 
Brands), being the lowest cash generating 
units (CGU) at which goodwill is monitored.
In assessing impairment, management 
estimates the recoverable value of each site 
by reference to the higher of its value in use 
(based on management’s key assumptions 
relating to discount rate, growth in profits 
and cash forecasts) and fair value less costs 
to sell (based on management’s estimates). 
The recoverable value is compared to the 
carrying value of each site to determine any 
impairment. For goodwill management 
performs its impairment analysis by considering 
the value in use of the operating segment, 
based on forecast cash flows for that segment.
These processes have a high degree of 
judgment and therefore carry a higher level 
of inherent risk of material error.
We performed a walk-through of the process employed to identify indicators of impairment and 
to estimate appropriate impairments of individual sites at individual CGU level or of goodwill 
at segment level. We then tested key elements of those processes.
In particular for both the trading estate and goodwill:
 – we compared assumed profit growth rates in cash flow forecasts to the budget, external 
market growth estimates and recent actual profit growth rates, and corroborated 
explanations for anomalies;
 – we utilised our valuation specialists to determine the reasonableness of the discount 
rate applied to cash flows through benchmarking to comparator companies and market 
expectations; and
 – we reperformed management’s sensitivities applied to the cash flows and considered 
management’s judgment of how a reasonably possible change in assumptions would lead 
to impairment based upon our knowledge of the group’s activities and factors in the sector.
For the trading estate, additionally:
 – where the fair value less costs of sale (FVLCS) was required to support the recoverable 
value of a site, we assessed the reasonableness of management’s estimate of FVLCS, using 
our own property valuation specialists, who utilised their knowledge of property valuation 
and comparator transactions; 
 – where impairment indicators existed but no impairment had been booked, we sought and 
corroborated explanations from management on individual pubs to assess whether an 
impairment charge was required; and
 – we checked a sample of sites to ensure that the site’s recoverable value used in the impairment 
model is the higher of value in use and FVLCS. Annual report 2015 GREENE KING PLC 65

Area of focus How our audit addressed the area of focus
Risks relating to uncertain tax positions
The group has implemented a number of 
intra-group arrangements to finance third 
party acquisitions and to effect other 
intra-group transactions. A number of the 
arrangements are in dispute with HMRC or 
have yet to be agreed. The uncertainty over 
resolution of these arrangements has required 
the directors to make judgments on the level 
of tax benefit that is likely to be realised 
compared to the level previously recorded. 
The directors obtain opinions from third party 
independent advisers to help them assess 
the level of tax liability required against the 
benefit previously recorded in prior periods.
Estimated liabilities for uncertain tax 
positions are included within Income tax 
payable of £50.8m (2014: £46.5m).
We used our tax audit specialists to assess the reasonableness of management’s judgments 
in relation to the uncertain tax positions, including the following steps:
 – we inspected correspondence with HMRC on the issues under dispute or not yet agreed;
 – in making our own assessment of the technical merits of each arrangement, we applied 
our own technical expertise and considered advice to management from third party 
specialists on the likely outcome of each arrangement;
 – we discussed management’s options for resolution of each issue in isolation 
and as a whole, and assessed the likely outcome of management’s strategies; 
 – we employed our understanding as a firm of HMRC dispute resolution to test 
management’s assumptions on certain cases; and
 – we tested that the basis for estimation of the tax liability was consistently applied across 
all of the arrangements, but taking account of new facts and developments.
Funding headroom and compliance with debt covenants
The group utilises two key sources of debt 
financing: (1) corporate bonds issued through 
the ring-fenced securitisation vehicle; and 
(2) a bank revolving credit facility of £460m. 
Both of these debt facilities require the group 
to comply with certain key covenants. 
Management prepare monthly covenant 
and headroom calculations and periodic 
investor reports and compliance certificates. 
Management’s assessment of funding 
headroom and covenant compliance 
involves significant forecast estimation, 
principally relating to revenue and 
profitability growth, and the quantum 
and timing of tax payments.
 – We performed a walk-through of the process employed by the group and related 
controls to ensure its compliance with debt covenants and sufficiency of funding;
 – We checked that the models used were consistent with the assumptions adopted 
by the group in the impairment models, tested by the audit team as described above; 
 – We checked management’s stress testing of the forecasting model to determine whether 
reasonably foreseeable issues could result in a shortage of funds or a breach of covenants 
in the forecast period; 
 – We considered whether the forecast model adequately addressed the funding needs 
and covenant compliance of the enlarged group following the acquisition of Spirit, 
taking into account the information made available by Spirit in the acquisition process; 
 – We checked key covenant terms included in the forecast model to copies of the executed 
bank agreements and re-performed covenant calculations to ensure that management’s 
covenant forecasts were correctly performed; and
 – We assessed all of the group’s work in this area to determine whether the directors 
had an appropriate basis for concluding on going concern.
Revenue recognition in relation to beer and liquor sales and the associated retrospective discounts 
In accordance with International Standards on 
Auditing (UK and Ireland) there is a presumed 
fraud risk relating to revenue recognition.
We consider that there is a higher level of risk 
associated with the appropriate recognition 
of sales in the correct accounting period on 
beer and liquor sales in the Brewing & Brands 
and Pub Partners divisions. There is also 
a higher level of risk associated with the 
accuracy and completeness of retrospective 
discounts due to the area being more 
susceptible to management override. 
We performed a walk-through of the processes for the recognition of beer and liquor sales 
in the Brewing & Brands and Pub Partners divisions and separately for the recognition 
of retrospective discounts by the group as a whole.
For beer and liquor sales:
 – we performed detailed transaction testing by agreeing a sample of individual revenue 
items to sales invoices, evidence of delivery and subsequent cash receipt; 
 – we performed sales cut-off testing immediately before and after period end by testing 
sales invoices to evidence of delivery to ensure that revenue had been recognised in the 
correct accounting period; additionally we have performed similar detailed testing on 
credit notes to confirm that the credit note has been recognised in the appropriate 
accounting period; and
 – we conducted specific analytical procedures on revenue and credit notes recognised 
either side of the year-end to test management’s conclusion that the related revenue 
had been recognised in the correct accounting period.
For retrospective customer discounts:
 – we agreed the nature and terms of certain significant discount arrangements to contracts 
or other supporting documentation;
 – we performed specific analytical procedures to compare discounts by customer relative 
to expectations, taking into account the terms of the discount arrangements and prior 
period amounts; and corroborated explanations for anomalies; and
 – we tested a sample of recognised rebates to the terms of the rebate, subsequent invoice 
and settlement to ensure the amounts accrued were reasonable.

statements, being the group income statement, group statement of comprehensive income, group balance sheet, group cash flow statement 
and group statement of changes in equity; and the related notes 1 to 32. The financial reporting framework that has been applied in their 
preparation is applicable law and International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the European Union. 
This report is made solely to the company’s members, as a body, in accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies Act 2006. Our 
audit work has been undertaken so that we might state to the company’s members those matters we are required to state to them in an 
auditor’s report and for no other purpose. To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility to anyone other 
than the company and the company’s members as a body, for our audit work, for this report, or for the opinions we have formed. 
Respective responsibilities of directors and auditor 
As explained more fully in the directors’ responsibilities statement set out on page 61, the directors are responsible for the preparation 
of the group financial statements and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view. Our responsibility is to audit and express an 
opinion on the group financial statements in accordance with applicable law and International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland). 
Those standards require us to comply with the Auditing Practices Board’s Ethical Standards for Auditors. 
Opinion on other matter prescribed by the Companies Act 2006 
In our opinion:
 – the information given in the strategic report and the directors’ report for the financial year for which the group financial statements 
are prepared is consistent with the group financial statements; and
 – the information given in the corporate governance statement set out on pages 38 to 45 with respect to internal control and risk 
management systems in relation to financial reporting processes and about share capital structures is consistent with the group financial 
statements.
Matters on which we are required to report by exception 
We have nothing to report in respect of the following: 
Under the ISAs (UK and Ireland), we are required to report to you if, in our opinion, information in the annual report is: 
 – materially inconsistent with the information in the audited financial statements; or
 – apparently materially incorrect based on, or materially inconsistent with, our knowledge of the group acquired in the course 
of performing our audit; or 
 – is otherwise misleading. 
In particular, we are required to consider whether we have identified any inconsistencies between our knowledge acquired during the 
audit and the directors’ statement that they consider the annual report is fair, balanced and understandable and whether the annual report 
appropriately discloses those matters that we communicated to the audit committee which we consider should have been disclosed. 
Under the Companies Act 2006 we are required to report to you if, in our opinion: 
 – certain disclosures of directors’ remuneration specified by law are not made; or 
 – we have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit; or
 – a corporate governance statement has not been prepared by the company.
Under the Listing Rules we are required to review: 
 – the directors’ statement, set out on page 60, in relation to going concern; and 
 – the part of the corporate governance statement relating to the company’s compliance with the ten provisions of the UK Corporate 
Governance Code specified for our review.
Other matter 
We have reported separately on the parent company financial statements of Greene King plc for the 52 weeks ended 3 May 2015 
and on the information in the directors’ remuneration report that is described as having been audited.

NOTES TO THE ACCOUNTS
For the fifty-two weeks ended 3 May 2015
1 Accounting policies
Corporate information
The consolidated financial statements of Greene King plc for the 52 weeks ended 3 May 2015 were authorised for issue by the board of 
directors on 30 June 2015. Greene King plc is a public limited company incorporated and domiciled in England and Wales. The company’s 
shares are listed on the London Stock Exchange.
Statement of compliance
The group’s financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as adopted 
by the EU as they apply to the financial statements of the group for the 52 weeks ended 3 May 2015 (prior year 53 weeks ended 4 May 2014) 
and in accordance with the provisions of the Companies Act 2006.
Basis of preparation
The consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with those parts of the Companies Act 2006 applicable to 
companies reporting under IFRS. They are presented in pounds sterling, with values rounded to the nearest hundred thousand, except 
where otherwise indicated.
Basis of consolidation
The consolidated financial statements incorporate the financial statements of Greene King plc, its subsidiaries and its related party, Greene 
King Finance plc. Greene King Finance plc is a special purpose entity set up to raise bond finance for the group. As Greene King plc has full 
control over the entity it is fully consolidated. The financial statements of subsidiaries are prepared for the same reporting year as the 
parent company with adjustments made to their financial statements to bring their accounting policies in line with those used by the group.
The results of subsidiaries are consolidated from the date of acquisition, being the date on which the group obtains control, and continue to be 
consolidated until the date that such control ceases. Intercompany transactions, balances, income and expenses are eliminated on consolidation.
Changes in accounting policies
The accounting policies adopted are consistent with those of the previous financial year, apart from the changes arising from the adoption 
of new accounting standards set out below:
Amendment to IAS 36 Recoverable Amount Disclosures for Non-Financial Assets
This amendment addresses the disclosure of information about the recoverable amount of impaired assets if that amount is based on fair 
value less costs of disposal. Disclosures in note 14 have been amended accordingly.
The Group has also adopted the following standards and interpretations which have been assessed as having no financial impact 
or disclosure requirements at this time:
 – IFRS 10 Consolidated Financial Statements and IAS 27 Separate Financial Statements (as revised in 2011)
 – IFRS 11 Joint Arrangements and IAS 28 Investment in Associates and Joint Ventures (as revised in 2011)
 – IFRS 12 Disclosure of Interests in Other Entities
 – IAS 32 Offsetting Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities (Amendment)
 – IAS 39 Novation of Derivatives and Continuation of Hedge Accounting (Amendment)
Significant accounting policies
Property, plant and equipment
Property, plant and equipment is stated at cost or deemed cost on transition to IFRS, less accumulated depreciation and any impairment in value.
Depreciation is calculated on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life of the asset. 
Freehold land is not depreciated. Freehold and long leasehold buildings are depreciated to their estimated residual values over periods 
up to 50 years, and short leasehold improvements are depreciated to their estimated residual values over the shorter of the remaining term 
of the lease or useful life of the asset. Residual value is reviewed at least at each financial year end and there is no depreciable amount if 
residual value is the same as, or exceeds, book value. Plant and equipment assets are depreciated over their estimated lives which range 
from three to 20 years.
Residual values, useful lives and methods of depreciation are reviewed for all categories of property, plant and equipment and adjusted, 
if appropriate, at each financial year end.
An item of property, plant and equipment is de-recognised upon disposal or when no future economic benefits are expected from its use. 
Profit or loss on de-recognition is calculated as the difference between the net disposal proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset, 
and is included in the income statement in the year of de-recognition.
Business combinations and goodwill 
Business combinations are accounted for using the acquisition method. The cost of an acquisition is measured as the aggregate of the 
consideration transferred, measured at acquisition date fair value, and the amount of any non-controlling interest in the acquire. The 
choice of measurement of non-controlling interests, either at fair value or at the proportionate share of the acquiree’s identifiable net 
assets, is determined on a transaction by transaction basis. Acquisition costs incurred are taken to the income statement.
When the group acquires a business, it assesses the financial assets and liabilities assumed for appropriate classification and designation 
in accordance with the contractual terms, economic circumstances and pertinent conditions as at the acquisition date. This includes 
the separation of embedded derivatives in host contracts of the acquiree.
Any contingent consideration to be transferred to the vendor will be recognised at fair value at the acquisition date. Subsequent changes 
to the fair value of the contingent consideration which are deemed to be an asset or a liability will be recognised in accordance with IAS 39 
either in the income statement or in other comprehensive income. If the contingent consideration is classified as equity, it should not be 
re-measured until it is finally settled within equity. Annual report 2015 GREENE KING PLC 73
Corporate governance Strategic report Financial statements Shareholder information
Goodwill is initially measured at cost being the excess of the aggregate of the acquisition-date fair value of the consideration transferred 
and the amount recognised for the non-controlling interest over the net identifiable amounts of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed 
in exchange for the business combination. Assets acquired and liabilities assumed in transactions separate to the business combinations, such as the 
settlement of pre-existing relationships or post-acquisition remuneration arrangements, are accounted for separately from the business 
combination in accordance with their nature and applicable IFRSs. Identifiable intangible assets, meeting either the contractual-legal 
or separability criterion, are recognised separately from goodwill. Contingent liabilities representing a present obligation are recognised 
if the acquisition-date fair value can be measured reliably.
If the aggregate of the acquisition-date fair value of the consideration transferred and the amount recognised for the non-controlling 
interest is lower than the fair value of the assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities and the fair value of any pre-existing interest held 
in the business acquired, the difference is recognised in the income statement.
After initial recognition, goodwill is measured at cost less any accumulated impairment losses. 
Impairment
Property, plant and equipment
Individual assets are grouped for impairment assessment purposes at the lowest level at which there are identifiable cash inflows 
independent of the cash inflows of other groups of assets.
An assessment is made at each reporting date as to whether there is an indication of impairment. If an indication exists, the group makes 
an estimate of the recoverable amount of each asset group. An asset’s or cash generating unit’s recoverable amount is the higher of its fair 
value less costs of disposal and value-in-use and is determined for an individual asset, unless the asset does not generate cash inflows that 
are largely independent of those from other assets or groups of assets.
An impairment loss is recognised where the recoverable amount is lower than the carrying value of assets. If there is an indication that any 
previously recognised impairment losses may no longer exist or may have decreased, a reversal of the loss may be made only if there has 
been a change in the estimates used to determine the recoverable amounts since the last impairment loss was recognised. The carrying 
amount of the asset is increased to its recoverable amount only up to the carrying amount that would have resulted, net of depreciation, 
had no impairment loss been recognised for the asset in prior years. 
Impairment losses and any subsequent reversals are recognised in the income statement.
Details of the impairment losses recognised in respect of property, plant and equipment are provided in note 14.
Goodwill
Goodwill is reviewed for impairment annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value 
may be impaired.
For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill acquired in a business combination is, from the acquisition date, allocated to each of the group’s 
cash-generating units (or groups of cash-generating units) that are expected to benefit from the combination, irrespective of whether other 
assets or liabilities of the acquiree are assigned to those units. Each unit or group of units to which goodwill is allocated represents the 
lowest level within the group at which goodwill is monitored for internal management purposes and cannot be larger than an operating 
segment before aggregation.
Impairment is determined by the recoverable amount of an operating segment. Where this is less than the carrying value of the operating 
segment an impairment loss is recognised immediately in the income statement. This loss cannot be reversed in future periods.
Where goodwill forms part of a cash-generating unit and part of the operation within that unit is disposed of, any goodwill associated with 
the operation disposed of is included in the carrying amount of the operation when determining the gain or loss on disposal of the operation. 
Goodwill disposed of in this circumstance is measured based on the relative values of the operation disposed of and the portion of the 
cash-generating unit retained.
Goodwill amortised prior to the conversion to IFRS on 3 May 2004 has not been reinstated and the net book value of goodwill at that date 
has been carried forward as the carrying value. Prior to May 1998, goodwill was written off to reserves. Such goodwill has not been 
reinstated and is not included in determining profit or loss on disposal.
Financial instruments
Financial instruments are recognised when the group becomes party to the contractual provisions of the instrument and are de-recognised 
when the group no longer controls the contractual rights that comprise the financial instrument, normally through sale or when all cash 
flows attributable to the instrument are passed to an independent third party.
Financial assets
Financial assets are classified as either financial assets at fair value through the income statement, loans and receivables, held-to-maturity 
investments or available-for-sale financial assets. The group determines the classification of its financial assets at initial recognition and, 
where appropriate, re-evaluates this designation at each financial year end.
The group makes trade loans to publicans who purchase the group’s beer. Trade loans are non-derivative and are not quoted in an active 
market and have therefore been designated as ‘Loans and receivables’, carried at amortised cost using the effective interest method. Gains 
and losses are recognised in income when the loans and receivables are de-recognised or impaired, as well as through the amortisation process.
The group assesses at each balance sheet date whether any individual trade loan is impaired. If there is evidence that an impairment loss has 
been incurred, the amount of loss is measured as the difference between the loan’s carrying amount and the expected future receipts, (excluding 
future credit losses that have not been incurred), discounted at the loan’s original effective interest rate. The loss is recognised in operating profit.
Trade receivables
Trade receivables are recorded at their original invoiced amount less an allowance for any doubtful amounts when collection of the full 
amount is no longer considered probable. GREENE KING PLC Annual report 2015 74

NOTES TO THE ACCOUNTS CONTINUED
For the fifty-two weeks ended 3 May 2015
1 Accounting policies continued
Significant accounting policies continued
Inventories
Inventories are valued at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Raw materials are valued at average cost. Finished goods and work 
in progress comprise materials, labour and attributable production overheads where applicable, and are valued at average cost.
Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents in the balance sheet comprise cash at bank and in hand and short-term deposits with an original maturity of 
three months or less. For the consolidated cash flow statement, cash and cash equivalents consist of cash and cash equivalents as defined 
above, net of outstanding bank overdrafts.
Property, plant and equipment held for sale
Property, plant and equipment is classified as held for sale only if it is available for sale in its current condition, management are committed 
to the sale and a sale is highly probable and expected to be completed within one year from the date of classification. Property, plant and equipment 
classified as held for sale is measured at the lower of carrying amount and fair value less costs of disposal and is no longer depreciated or amortised.
Interest-bearing loans and borrowings
All loans and borrowings are initially recognised at fair value of the consideration received, net of issue costs. After initial recognition, 
interest-bearing loans and borrowings are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method.
Finance costs and income
Finance costs are expensed to the income statement using the effective interest method. Finance income is recognised in the income 
statement using the effective interest method.
Derivative financial instruments and hedge accounting
The group uses interest rate swaps to hedge its exposure to interest rate fluctuations on its variable rate loans, notes and bonds.
Interest rate swaps are initially measured at fair value, if any, and carried on the balance sheet as an asset or liability. Subsequent 
measurement is at fair value determined by reference to market values for similar instruments. If a derivative does not qualify for hedge 
accounting the gain or loss arising on the movement in fair value is recognised in the income statement.
Hedge accounting
To qualify for hedge accounting the hedge relationship must be designated and documented at inception. Documentation must include the 
group’s risk management objective and strategy for undertaking the hedge and formal allocation to the item or transaction being hedged. 
The group also documents how it will assess the effectiveness of the hedge and carries out assessments on a regular basis to determine 
whether it has been, and is likely to continue to be, highly effective.
Hedges can be classified as either fair value (hedging exposure to changes in fair value of an asset or liability) or cash flow (hedging the 
variability in cash flows attributable to an asset, liability, or forecast transaction). The group uses its interest rate swaps as cash flow hedges.
Cash flow hedge accounting
The effective portion of the gain or loss on an interest rate swap is recognised directly in equity, whilst any ineffective portion is recognised 
immediately in the income statement. 
Amounts taken to equity are transferred to the income statement in the same period that the financial income or expense is recognised, 
unless the hedged transaction results in the recognition of a non-financial asset or liability whereby the amounts are transferred to the 
initial carrying amount of the asset or liability.
When a hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated or exercised, or no longer qualifies for hedge accounting, amounts previously 
recognised in equity are held there until the previously hedged transaction affects profit or loss. If the hedged transaction is no longer 
expected to occur, the cumulative gain or loss recognised in equity is immediately transferred to the income statement.
Trade payables
Trade payables are non-interest bearing and are stated at their nominal value.
Provisions
Provisions are recognised when the group has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of a past event, when it is probable that 
an outflow of resources will be required to settle the obligation, and when a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation.
Provisions are discounted to present value, where the effect of the time value of money is material, using a pre-tax discount rate that 
reflects current market estimates of the time value of money and the risks specific to the liability. The amortisation of the discount is 
recognised as a finance cost.
Pensions and other post-employment benefits
Defined benefit pension schemes
The group operates two defined benefit pension schemes which require contributions to be made into separately administered funds. 
The cost of providing benefits under the schemes is determined separately for each plan using the projected unit credit actuarial method 
on an annual basis. The current service cost is charged to operating profit. Any actuarial gains and losses are recognised in full in the group 
statement of comprehensive income in the period in which they occur.
When a settlement or curtailment occurs the obligation and related scheme assets are re-measured and the resulting gain or loss is recognised 
in the income statement in the same period.
Net interest is calculated by applying the discount rate to the net defined benefit liability or asset and is recorded in the group income statement.
The defined benefit asset or liability recognised on the balance sheet comprises the present value of the schemes’ obligations less the fair 
value of scheme assets. Defined benefit assets are restricted to the extent that they are considered recoverable. Annual report 2015 GREENE KING PLC 75
Corporate governance Strategic report Financial statements Shareholder information
Defined contribution pension schemes
The cost of the group’s defined contribution pension schemes amounts to the value of contributions made. Contributions are charged 
to the income statement as they become payable.
Share-based payments
Certain employees and directors receive equity-settled remuneration, whereby they render services in exchange for shares or rights over 
shares. The fair value of the shares and options granted is measured using a Black-Scholes model, at the date at which they were granted. 
No account is taken in the fair value calculation of any vesting conditions (service and performance), other than market conditions 
(performance linked to the price of the shares of the company). Any other conditions that are required to be met in order for an employee 
to become fully entitled to an award are considered non-vesting conditions. Like market performance conditions, non-vesting conditions 
are taken into account in determining the grant date fair value. The fair value of shares and options granted is recognised as an employee 
expense with a corresponding increase in equity spread over the period in which the vesting conditions are fulfilled ending on the relevant 
vesting date. The cumulative amount recognised as an expense reflects the extent to which the vesting period has expired, adjusted for 
the estimated number of shares and options that are ultimately expected to vest. The periodic charge or credit is the movement in the 
cumulative position from beginning to end of that period.
No expense is recognised for awards that do not ultimately vest provided vesting is not conditional on market or non-vesting conditions. 
The dilutive effect of outstanding options is reflected as additional share dilution in calculating earnings per share figures.
Own shares
Own shares consist of treasury shares and shares held within an employee benefit trust. The group has an employee benefit trust for the 
granting of shares to applicable employees. 
Own shares are recognised at cost as a deduction from shareholders’ equity. Subsequent consideration received for the sale of such shares 
is also recognised in equity, with any difference between the sale proceeds from the original cost being taken to revenue reserves. No gain 
or loss is recognised in the performance statements on transactions in treasury shares.
Revenue
Generally, revenue represents external sales (excluding taxes) of goods and services, net of discounts. Revenue is recognised to the extent 
that it is probable that the economic benefits will flow to the group and is measured at the fair value of consideration receivable, excluding 
discounts, rebates, and other sales taxes or duty relating to brewing and packaging of certain products. Revenue principally consists of 
drink, food and accommodation sales, which are recognised at the point at which goods or services are provided, rental income, which 
is recognised on a straight-line basis over the lease term and machine income, where net takings are recognised as earned.
Operating leases
Leases where the lessor retains substantially all the risks and benefits of ownership are classified as operating leases. Lease payments 
are recognised as an expense in the income statement on a straight-line basis over the period of the lease.
Lease premiums paid on entering into or acquiring operating leases represent prepaid lease payments and are held on the balance sheet 
as current (the portion relating to the next financial period) or non-current prepayments. These are amortised on a straight-line basis over 
the lease term.
Taxes
Income tax
The income tax charge comprises both the income tax payable based on profits for the year and the deferred income tax. It is calculated 
using taxation rates enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date and is measured at the amount expected to be recovered 
from or paid to the taxation authorities.
Income tax relating to items recognised directly in equity is recognised in equity and not in the income statement.
Deferred tax
Deferred tax is provided for using the liability method on temporary differences at the balance sheet date between the tax bases of assets 
and liabilities and their carrying values in the financial statements.
Deferred tax is recognised for all temporary differences except where the deferred tax arises from the initial recognition of goodwill or of an 
asset or liability in a transaction that is not a business combination that, at the time of the transaction, affects neither the accounting profit 
nor taxable profit or loss or, in respect of taxable temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries, where the timing of the reversal 
of the temporary differences can be controlled and it is probable that the temporary differences will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
Deferred tax assets are recognised for all deductible temporary differences and carry forward of unused tax losses only to the extent that 
it is probable that taxable profit will be available against which the deductible temporary differences and the carry forward of unused tax 
losses can be utilised.
The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each balance sheet date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable 
that sufficient taxable profit will be available to allow all or part of the deferred tax asset to be utilised. Unrecognised deferred tax assets 
are reassessed at each balance sheet date and are recognised to the extent that it has become probable that future taxable profit will allow 
the deferred tax asset to be recovered.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured, on an undiscounted basis, at the tax rates that are expected to apply to the year when 
the asset is realised or the liability is settled, based on tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax relating to items recognised directly in equity is recognised in equity and not in the income statement. GREENE KING PLC Annual report 2015 76

Exceptional items
Exceptional items are defined as items of income or expense which, because of their nature, size or expected frequency, merit separate

New standards and interpretations not applied
As at the date of approval of the financial statements there are a number of standards and interpretations issued by the IASB and IFRIC 
with an effective date after the date of these financial statements and which have not been early adopted by the group. These are expected 
to be applied as follows:
IFRS 9 Financial Instruments
IFRS 9 Financial Instruments was first issued in November 2009 and has since been amended several times. A complete version of the 
standard was issued in July 2014 and is a replacement of IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement. IFRS 9 covers the 
classification, measurement and derecognition of financial assets and financial liabilities, together with a new hedge accounting model and 
the new expected credit loss model for calculating impairment. The new standard becomes effective for annual periods beginning on or after 
1 January 2018, subject to EU adoption. The group is currently considering the impact of IFRS 9 on its consolidated results and financial position.
IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers
The IASB issued IFRS 15 Revenue from contracts with customers in May 2014. The new standard provides a single, five-step revenue 
recognition model, applicable to all sales contracts, which is based upon the principle that revenue is recognised when the control of goods 
or services is transferred to the customer. This standard replaces all existing revenue recognition guidance under current IFRS and becomes 
effective for annual period beginning on or after 1 January 2017, subject to EU adoption. The group is currently considering the impact 
of IFRS 15 on its consolidated results and financial position.
Other standards and interpretations that are relevant to the group have been assessed as having no financial impact or additional 
disclosure requirements at this time.
Significant accounting judgments and estimates
The preparation of financial statements requires management to make judgments, estimates and assumptions in the application of accounting 
policies that affect reported amounts of assets and liabilities, income and expense. The group bases its estimates and judgments on historical 
experience and other factors deemed reasonable under the circumstances, including any expectations of future events. Actual results may 
differ from these estimates. The estimates and judgments considered to be significant are detailed below:
Taxation
Judgment is required when determining the provision for taxes as the tax treatment of some transactions cannot be finally determined 
until a formal resolution has been reached with the tax authorities. Assumptions are also made around the assets which qualify for capital 
allowances and the level of disallowable expenses and this affects the income tax calculation. Provisions are also made for uncertain exposures 
which can have an impact on both deferred and current tax. Tax benefits are not recognised unless it is probable that the benefit will be 
obtained and tax provisions are made if it is possible that a liability will arise. The final resolution of these transactions may give rise to 
material adjustments to the income statement and/or cash flow in future periods. The group reviews each significant tax liability or benefit 
each period to assess the appropriate accounting treatment.
Share-based payments
Judgment is required when calculating the fair value of awards made under the group’s share-based payment plans. Note 8 describes the 
key assumptions and valuation model inputs used in the determination of these values. In addition estimates are made of the number of 
awards that will ultimately vest, judgment is required in relation to the probability of meeting non-market based performance conditions 
and the continuing participation of employees in the plans.
Pension liabilities
The present values of pension liabilities are determined on an actuarial basis and depend on a number of actuarial assumptions which are 
disclosed in note 9. Any change in these assumptions will impact on the carrying amount of pension liabilities. Note 9 describes the key 
assumptions used in the accounting for retirement benefit obligations.
Impairment of goodwill
The group determines whether goodwill is impaired on at least an annual basis. Details of the tests and carrying value of the assets are shown 
in note 13. This requires an estimation of the value-in-use of the cash-generating units to which the goodwill is allocated. Value-in-use calculations 
require assumptions to be made regarding the expected future cash flows from the cash-generating unit and choice of a suitable discount 
rate in order to calculate the present value of those cash flows. If the actual cash flows are lower than estimated, future impairments 
may be necessary.
Impairment of property, plant and equipment
The group determines whether property, plant and equipment is impaired where there are indicators of impairment. This requires an 
estimation of the value-in-use and fair value less costs of disposal at a site level. Value-in-use calculations require assumptions to be made 
regarding the expected future cash flows from the cash-generating unit and choice of a suitable discount rate in order to calculate 
the present value of those cash flows. 
Note 14 describes the assumptions used in the impairment testing of property, plant and equipment together with an analysis of the sensitivity 
to changes in key assumptions.
Residual values
Residual values of property are determined with reference to current market property trends. If residual values were lower than estimated, 
an impairment of asset value and reassessment of future depreciation charge may be required. Useful lives are reassessed annually which 
may lead to an increase or reduction in depreciation accordingly. Annual report 2015 GREENE KING PLC 77
Corporate governance Strategic report Financial statements Shareholder information
Property provisions
The group provides for its onerous obligations under operating leases where the property is closed or vacant and for properties where 
rental expense is in excess of income. The estimated timings and amounts of cash flows are determined using the experience of internal 
and external property experts. However, changes to the expected method of exiting from the obligation could lead to changes in the level 
of provision recorded.
2 Segment information
The group has determined the following three reportable segments that are largely organised and managed separately according 
to the nature of products and services provided, distribution channels and profile of customers: 
Retail: Managed pubs and restaurants 
Pub Partners: Tenanted and leased pubs
Brewing & Brands: Brewing, marketing and selling beer
These are also considered to be the group’s operating segments and are based on the information presented to the chief executive 
who is considered to be the chief operating decision maker.
Transfer prices between operating segments are set on an arm’s length basis.

5 Exceptional items continued
Exceptional operating costs
During the period, the group recognised £15.8m (2014: £nil) of exceptional legal and professional fees that related to the acquisition of 
Spirit Pub Company plc and other potential acquisitions and defending uncertain tax provisions. These amounts include £10.6m of fees 
that were contingent on the completion of the acquisition of Spirit Pub Company plc which have been recognised in accordance with IAS 
32 and will be settled in financial year ending 1 May 2016.
During the period the group recognised an impairment loss of £27.4m (2014: £22.0m) in respect of its licensed estate. The impairment has 
been recognised in respect of pubs where the higher of value-in-use and fair value less costs of disposal has fallen below the net book value. 
In the period, the group received further insurance compensation to meet the costs of restoring sites damaged by fire in a previous period 
totalling £0.1m (2014: £3.4m). 
During the period ended 2 May 2010 the group received a refund of £7.0m from HMRC in respect of VAT on gaming machines following 
a ruling involving the Rank Group plc that the application of VAT contravened the EU’s principal of fiscal neutrality. HMRC appealed the 
ruling issuing protective assessments to recover the VAT in the event their appeal was successful. On 30 October 2013 the decision was 
overturned and the group was therefore required to repay the VAT of £7.0m and associated interest of £1.7m. On 16 April 2014 the Supreme 
Court granted Rank permission to appeal and the case was heard on 21 April 2015. A decision is expected during 2015.
The group incurred £1.5m (2014: £nil) of exceptional employee costs, which included restructuring costs and costs associated with changes 
to key management. 
A share-based payment credit of £0.6m results from the reversal of charges recognised in previous years following a reassessment 
of expected scheme performance.
The net profit on disposal of property plant and equipment of £0.1m (2014: £6.4m loss) comprises a total profit on disposal of £10.2m 
(2014: £8.0m) and a total loss on disposal of £10.1m (2014: £14.4m). 
On 1 May 2014 the group announced the disposal of 275 non-core pubs from our Pub Partners’ estate; this disposal completed on 2 June 2014. 
In the prior period, an impairment charge totalling £34.2m was recognised as a result of this disposal: £19.6m in respect of the carrying 
value of the assets and a charge of £14.6m relating to the impairment of goodwill allocated to these sites.
Exceptional finance costs
The £2.4m fair value loss (2014: £1.1m gain) is the mark-to-market movement on the ineffective element of cash flow hedges resulting 
from changes in the LIBOR yield curve.
Exceptional tax
The tax credit in respect of the licensed estate has arisen from movements in their tax base cost, including the impact of indexation.
The Finance Act 2013 reduced the rate of corporation tax from 21% to 20% from 1 April 2015. The effect of the reduced rate was included 
in the accounts for the previous period.
The adjustment in respect of prior periods’ income tax arises from finalising the tax returns for earlier periods including the reversal of tax 
relief previously taken on intra-group transactions.
The adjustment in respect of prior periods’ deferred tax arises from finalising the tax returns for earlier periods and also deferred tax 
on revaluation and rolled over gains on the licensed estate.

8 Share-based payment plans
The group operates three types of share-based payment arrangements: a senior management long-term incentive plan (LTIP/Growth LTIP), 
a deferred share scheme for other management and a general employee share option plan (SAYE). In prior periods a deferred bonus scheme 
and an executive share option plan (ESOS) have also been operated.
The general terms of each plan are detailed in the directors’ remuneration report starting on page 46. All are equity settled. 
The total charge recognised for the period arising from share-based payment transactions including National Insurance contributions 
is £3.4m (2014: £6.0m). A corresponding credit of £3.1m (2014: £4.4m) has been recognised in equity.
The fair value of the LTIP/growth LTIP issued since 2014 is considered to be equal to the share price on the date of issue. For 2015 issue the fair 
value was 8.40p (2014: 7 .81p). Future dividend payments have not been factored into the valuation as participants are entitled to dividend payments. 
The fair value of previous issued equity-settled options and LTIP were estimated using the Black-Scholes model.
The fair value of other equity-settled options is estimated using a Black-Scholes model. The fair value of the grants and model inputs used 
to calculate the fair values of grants during the period were as follows:
2015 SAYE 
Weighted average share price 857p
Exercise price 590p
Expected dividend yield 3.6%
Risk-free rate of return 0.7%
Volatility 20.1%
Expected life (years) 3.3
Weighted average fair value of grants in the year 215p
2014 SAYE 
Weighted average share price 865p
Exercise price 701p
Expected dividend yield 3.3%
Risk-free rate of return 0.6%
Volatility 21.6%
Expected life (years) 3.3
Weighted average fair value of grants in the year 163p
Risk-free rate of return is the yield on zero-coupon UK Government bonds with the same life as the expected option life. Expected 
volatility is based on historical volatility of the company’s share price which assumes that the past trend in share price movement is 
indicative of future trends. The expected life of options has been taken as the mid-point of the relevant exercise period. This is not 
necessarily indicative of future exercise patterns. 
No other feature of the equity instruments granted was incorporated into the fair value measurement. GREENE KING PLC Annual report 2015 82

ESOS, SAYE and LTIP
Options were exercised on a range of dates. The weighted average share price through the period was 809p in 2015 and 841p in 2014.
The rights outstanding at 3 May 2015 under the LTIP had an exercise price of £nil (2014: £nil) and a weighted average remaining contractual 
life of 1.3 years (2014: 1.3 years). 
The outstanding options for the ESOS scheme had an exercise price of 528p (2014: between 408p and 528p) and for the SAYE scheme 
between 349p and 701p (2014: between 274p and 701p).
The weighted average remaining contractual life was 0.3 years for the ESOS (2014: 1.1 years) and 3.4 years for the SAYE scheme (2014: 2.8 years).
Deferred share bonus scheme
In the prior period selected senior executives participated in a deferred share bonus scheme. Awards made under this scheme were based 
on a percentage of salary and were paid in shares. Awards were made to eligible employees on the achievement of corporate targets and 
vested once required service periods were completed. During the year no shares (2014: 0.04m) were purchased to fulfil awards made in 2013/14 
(2012/13) under this scheme. Annual report 2015 GREENE KING PLC 83

9 Pensions
The group maintains two defined contribution schemes, which are open to all new employees, and two defined benefit schemes. 
The group also has a past service liability in relation to post-employment medical benefits previously offered to employees to cover any 
medical costs after employment. This benefit is no longer given to employees.
Defined contribution pension scheme
Member funds for the defined contribution schemes are held and administered by the Friends Life Group. The total cost recognised 
in operating profit for the period was £4.6m (2014: £4.4m).
Defined benefit pension schemes and post-employment benefits 
The group maintains the following defined benefit schemes which are both closed to new entrants and were closed to future accrual during 2013. 
Both schemes have had full actuarial valuations in the last three years: Greene King Pension Scheme (last valued as at 5 April 2012) and 
Belhaven Pension Scheme (last valued as at 4 May 2011). 
Member funds for the defined benefit schemes are held in separate funds independently of the group’s finances and are administered 
by pension trustees. Pension benefits are related to members’ final salary at the earlier of retirement or closure to future accrual and their 
length of service. 
Since the pension liability is adjusted for the changes to the consumer price index, the pension plan is exposed to inflation, interest rate risks 
and changes in the life expectancy for pensioners. As the plan assets include significant investments in quoted equity shares of entities in 
manufacturing and consumer product sector, the group is also exposed to equity market risk arising in the manufacturing and consumer 
products sector.

The values of the schemes’ liabilities have been determined by a qualified actuary based on the results of the last actuarial valuation, 
updated to 3 May 2015 using the following principal actuarial assumptions:
2015 2014
Discount rate 3.4% 4.1%
Expected pension payment increases 3.2% 3.3%
Rate of inflation (RPI) 3.3% 3.6%
Rate of inflation (CPI) 2.3% 2.7%
The mortality assumptions imply the following expectations of years of life from age 65:
Man currently aged 40 24.5  24.6 
Woman currently aged 40 26.7  27.0 
Man currently aged 65 22.3  22.4 
Woman currently aged 65 24.4  24.5 
Mortality assumptions are based on standard tables adjusted for scheme experience and with an allowance for future improvement 
in life expectancy. 
The table below shows the investment allocation of pension assets against the related liabilities of the pension schemes and other

12 Earnings per share
Basic earnings per share has been calculated by dividing the profit attributable to equity holders of £89.3m (2014: £96.1m) by the weighted 
average number of shares in issue during the period (excluding own shares held) of 218.3m (2014: 217.2m). 
Diluted earnings per share has been calculated on a similar basis taking account of 1.6m (2014: 1.1m) dilutive potential shares under option, 
giving a weighted average number of ordinary shares adjusted for the effect of dilution of 219.9m (2014: 218.3m). There were no (2014: nil) 
anti-dilutive share options excluded from the diluted earnings per share calculation. The performance conditions for share options granted 
over 1.5m (2014: 2.6m) shares have not been met in the current financial period and therefore the dilutive effect of the number of shares 
which would have been issued at the period end has not been included in the diluted earnings per share calculation. 
Adjusted earnings per share excludes the effect of exceptional items and is presented to show the underlying performance of the group 
on both a basic and diluted basis.

All goodwill was purchased as part of business combinations. As from 3 May 2004, the date of transition to IFRS, goodwill is no longer 
amortised but is subject to annual impairment testing.
Goodwill has been allocated to operating segments, the lowest group of cash-generating units in the group at which goodwill is monitored 
internally, based on the extent that the benefits of acquisitions flow to that segment.
Goodwill disposed of in the year is the amount of goodwill allocated to parts of operating segments disposed of during the year. 
The amount disposed is calculated based on the relative value of the operation disposed and the portion of the operating segment retained. 
The carrying amount of goodwill has been allocated £352.7m (2014: £353.5m) to Retail, £133.7m (2014: £135.8m) to Pub Partners, 
and £214.5m (2014: £214.5m) to Brewing & Brands.
The recoverable amount of each segment was determined on a value-in-use basis, using cash flow projections based on one year budgets 
approved by the board, and in all cases exceeded the carrying amount. 
The key assumptions used in the value-in-use calculations are budgeted EBITDA, the pre-tax discount rate and the growth rate used 
to extrapolate cash flows beyond the budgeted period.
Budgeted EBITDA is based on past experience adjusted to take account of the impact of expected changes to sales prices, volumes, 
business mix and margin, based on the current estate and committed capital expenditures.
Cash flows are discounted at 9.0% (2014: 9.0%) which is used as an approximation for the risk-adjusted discount rate of the relevant 
operating segment. A growth rate of 1.0% (2014: 2.0%) has been used to extrapolate cash flows. The growth rate is below the long-term 
average growth rate for the industry and reflects trends in trading performance. 
Sensitivity to changes in assumptions
The calculation is most sensitive to changes in the assumptions used for budgeted cash flow, pre-tax discount rate and growth rate. 
Management considers that reasonable possible changes in assumptions would be an increase in discount of 1% point, a reduction in growth 
rate of 1% point or a 10% reduction in budgeted cash flow. As an indication of sensitivity, when applied to the value-in-use calculation neither 
a 1% reduction in growth rate or a 10% reduction in cash flow would have resulted in an impairment of goodwill in the period, a 1% increase 
in the discount rate would have resulted in a £4.6m (2014: £nil) impairment to the goodwill allocated to Pub Partners, with the carrying 
amount equalling the recoverable amount at a discount rate of 9.9%. Annual report 2015 GREENE KING PLC 89

Valuation
The licensed estate properties were valued by the group’s own professionally qualified chartered surveyors, as at 20 December 2003, 
on the basis of existing use value, in accordance with the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors’ Appraisal and Valuation Standards. 
A representative sample of properties was also valued by external valuers, Gerald Eve Chartered Surveyors and Property Consultants, 
who confirmed that the values were consistent with their appraisal. Frozen revaluation has been taken as deemed cost on the transition 
to IFRS; therefore, no historic cost analysis is provided.
Up to 1999 the brewery and depots were valued at depreciated replacement cost and other properties at open market value. These valuations 
have been retained but they have not been updated. Subsequent additions have been included at cost or, in the case of acquisitions, at fair value.
Charges over assets
Included in land and buildings are properties with a net book value of £1,425.2m (2014: £1,422.1m) over which there is a first charge 
in favour of the securitised debt holders as detailed in note 22. GREENE KING PLC Annual report 2015 90

During the year £27.4m of impairment losses (2014: £41.6m) were recognised in the income statement as exceptional costs. 
The prior year impairment charge includes a £19.6m charge in relation to the sale of the disposal group as discussed in note 5.
These are analysed between the group’s principal reporting segments as shown below:

Pub Partners 6.3  18.5 
Pub Partners in respect of disposal group (note 5) —  19.6 
27.4 41.6 
The group considers that each of its individual pubs is a cash-generating unit (CGU). Each CGU is reviewed annually for indicators of impairment. 
When indicators of impairment are identified the carrying value of the CGU is compared to its recoverable amount. The recoverable 
amount is the higher of the CGU’s fair value less costs of disposal and its value-in-use.
The group estimates value-in-use using a discounted cash flow model. The key assumptions used are the discount rate applied to cash flow 
projections of 9% (2014: 9%) and the projected cash flows extrapolated using an average growth rate of 1% (2014: 2%) which is below the 
long-term average growth rate for the industry and reflects trends in trading performance. Cash-flow projections relating to individual 
CGUs have been made based on historic trends adjusted for management’s estimates of medium term trading prospects. 
Estimates of fair value less costs of disposal are based on valuations undertaken by in-house property experts. The valuation considers 
assumptions such as current, and future projected income levels, which take account of the location and quality of the pub. In addition 
recent market transactions in the sector and potential alternative use values have been considered. 
The valuation techniques applied are consistent with the principles in IFRS 13 Fair Value Measurement. As they use significant 
unobservable inputs they are classified within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy; this hierarchy is further explained in note 23.
The impairment charge recognised in relation to a small number of pubs was driven by changes in the local competitive and trading 
environment at their respective sites, and decisions taken to exit some sites where current market values are lower than book values. 
The prior year impairment in respect of the disposal group was calculated based on expected net disposal proceeds. 
Sensitivity to changes in assumptions
The level of impairment is predominantly dependent upon judgments used in arriving at fair values, future growth rates and the discount 
rate applied to cash flow projections. The impact on the impairment charge of applying different assumptions to fair values, the growth 
rates used to calculate cash flow projections and in the pre-tax discount rates would be as follows:

Trade loans are advanced to customers on terms linked to supply terms such that returns are greater than interest income. The fixed rate 
trade loans amounted to £20.7m (2014: £21.7m) and variable rate trade loans amounted to £13.3m (2014: £14.7m). Included in fixed rate loans 
are £17.5m of loans with settlement related to purchase levels (2014: £14.2m). The write-down of these loans has been taken on a straight-line 
basis over the remaining term of the loan as an approximation of the settlement. 
The fixed rate trade loans had a weighted average interest rate of 0.64% (2014: 0.73%) and a weighted average period of 4.55 years

Bank overdrafts
Overdrafts are utilised for the day to day management of cash. The group has facilities of £25.0m (2014: £25.0m) available with interest 
linked to base rate.
Bank loans – unsecured
In the prior period the group increased and extended a 5-year revolving credit facility of £460m, of which £248.2m (2014: £276.6m) was 
drawn down at the year end. Any amounts drawn down bear interest at a margin above LIBOR, with commitment payments on the undrawn 
portions. Interest is payable at each renewal date which vary in maturity. Although any individual draw-downs are repayable within 12 months 
of the balance sheet date, the group expects to renew this funding and, immediate renewal is available under the £460m facility until June 2018. 
Final repayment of the total drawn-down balance is due as one payment on the agreement repayment date.
Liquidity facility
During the prior period the standby liquidity facility provider had its short-term credit rating downgraded below the minimum prescribed 
in the facility agreement and as such the group exercised its entitlement to draw the full amount of the facility and hold it in a designated 
bank account. The corresponding balance of £157.5m (2014: £157.5m) held in this bank account is included within cash and cash equivalents. 
The amounts drawn down can only be used for the purpose of meeting the securitisation’s debt service obligations should there ever 
be insufficient funds available from operations to meet such payments. As such these amounts are considered to be restricted cash. 
Securitised debt
The group has issued various tranches of bonds in connection with the securitisation of 2,035 of the group’s pubs held in Greene King 
Retailing Limited at the date of the most recent tap. The bonds are secured over the properties and their future income streams and were 
issued by Greene King Finance plc.

22 Borrowings continued
Securitised debt continued
The Class A1, A2, A3, A4 and A5 bonds rank pari passu in point of security and as to payment of interest and principal, and have 
preferential interest payment and repayment rights over the Class B bonds. The Class B1 and B2 bonds rank pari passu in point of security, 
principal repayment and interest payment.
The securitisation is governed by various covenants, warranties and events of default, many of which apply to Greene King Retailing 
Limited, a group company. These include covenants regarding the maintenance and disposal of securitised properties and restrictions 
on its ability to move cash to other group companies.
23 Financial instruments
The primary treasury objectives of the group are to identify and manage the financial risks that arise in relation to underlying business 
needs, and provide secure and competitively priced funding for the activities of the group. If appropriate, the group uses financial 
instruments and derivatives to manage these risks.
The principal financial instruments held for the purpose of raising finance for operations are bank loans and overdraft, securitised bonds, 
cash and short-term deposits. Other financial instruments arise directly from the operations of the group, such as trade receivables, 
payables and trade loans.
Derivative financial instruments, principally interest rate swaps, are used to manage the interest rate risks related to the group’s operations 
and financing sources. No speculative trading in derivative financial instruments is undertaken.
The main risks from the group’s financial instruments are interest rate risk, liquidity risk, credit risk and cash flow risk. The policy for 
managing each of these risks is set out below.
Interest rate risk
Exposure to changes in interest rates on the group’s borrowings is reviewed with regard to the maturity profile and cash flows of the 
underlying debt. The group uses a mixture of fixed and floating interest rate debt with exposure to market interest rate fluctuations 
primarily arising from the floating rate instruments. The group operates a policy that no less than 95% of the overall interest exposure 
should be hedged. The group enters into interest rate swaps to manage the exposure. The swaps are designated as cash flow hedges 
at the date of contract included within the accounts, and tested for effectiveness every six months.
In accordance with IFRS 7, the group has undertaken sensitivity analysis on its financial instruments which are affected by changes in 
interest rates. This analysis has been prepared on the basis of a constant amount of net debt, a constant ratio of fixed to floating interest 
rates, and on the basis of the hedging instruments in place at 3 May 2015 and 4 May 2014. The analysis relates only to balances at these 
dates and is not representative of the year as a whole. The following assumptions were made:
 – Balance sheet sensitivity to interest rates applies only to derivative financial instruments, as the carrying value of debt and deposits 
does not change as interest rates move.
 – Gains and losses are recognised within equity or the income statement in line with the accounting policies of the group.
 – Cash flow hedges were assumed to be effective or ineffective on the same basis as those as at the year end. An explanation for the split between 
those hedges that were effective at the year end and those that were ineffective is detailed within the cash flow hedging note.
Based on the group’s net position at the year end, a 1% increase or decrease in interest rates would change the group’s profit before tax 
by approximately £0.6m (2014: £0.6m) and the group’s equity by £87.6m (2014: £81.0m).
Liquidity risk
The group mitigates liquidity risk by managing cash generated by its operations combined with bank borrowings and long-term debt. 
The group’s objective is to maintain a balance between the continuity of funding and flexibility through the use of overdrafts and bank 
loans. The group also monitors the maturity of financial liabilities to avoid the risk of a shortage of funds.
The standard payment terms that the group has with its suppliers is 60 days following month end (2014: 60 days following month end).
Excess cash used in managing liquidity is placed on interest-bearing deposit with maturities fixed at no more than 1 month. Short-term 
flexibility is achieved through the use of short-term borrowing on the money markets. Annual report 2015 GREENE KING PLC 95

Credit risk
The policy for third party trading is that all customers who wish to trade on credit terms are subject to regular credit verification 
procedures. Receivable balances are also monitored on an ongoing basis and provided against where deemed necessary to limit 
the exposure to bad debts to a non-significant level.
Other financial assets includes trade loans and cash. Credit risk is the risk of default by the counterparty to discharge their obligation 
and the maximum exposure of the group is the carrying amount of these instruments.
There is no significant collateral held and there are no significant concentrations of credit risk within the group.
Cash flow hedging
At 3 May 2015 the group held 3 (2014: 4) interest rate swap contracts for a nominal value of £135m (2014: £170m), designated as a hedge 
of the cash flow interest rate risk of the £248.3m (2014: £276.6m) draw-down from the revolving credit facility in the year. The interest rate 
swaps are held on the balance sheet as a fair value liability of £32.8m (2014: £23.4m). The cash flows occurred semi-annually based 
a variable rate of interest based on LIBOR.
At 3 May 2015 the group held 5 (2014: 5) interest rate swap contracts for a nominal value of £558.1m (2014: £585.1m), entered into as part 
of the securitisation and subsequent securitisation taps. A fair value liability of £204.1m (2014: £149.0m) has been recognised on the balance 
sheet in respect of these contracts which are designated cash flow hedges against £558.1m (2014: £585.1m) of variable rate bonds, receiving 
a variable rate of interest based on LIBOR and paying a weighted average fixed rate of 7.3% (2014: 7.3%). The contract maturity dates 
are December 2034 and March 2036. The bonds and interest rate swaps have the same critical terms excluding credit risk.
Changes in cash flow hedge fair values are recognised in the hedging reserve to the extent that the hedges are effective. The interest rate 
swaps have been assessed as highly effective during the period and are expected to remain highly effective over their remaining contract lives. 
The ineffectiveness amounting to £0.8m loss (2014: £2.7m gain) have been recognised with finance costs/income.
The percentage of debt that was fixed as at the year end was 95.5% (2014: 95.5%), in line with the group’s policy of fixing at least 95% of all debt. GREENE KING PLC Annual report 2015 96

The interest on variable rate financial instruments is repriced at intervals of less than one year. The interest on fixed rate financial 
instruments is fixed until the maturity of the instrument. Other financial assets, trade and other receivables, and trade and other payables 
are not included above as they are non-interest bearing and are not subject to interest rate risk.
Fair values
Set out in the table on page 97 is a comparison of carrying amounts and fair values of all of the group’s financial instruments.
The fair values of the financial assets and liabilities are included at the amount at which the instrument could be exchanged in a current 
transaction between willing parties, other than in a forced liquidation or sale. The following methods and assumptions were used 
to estimate the fair values:
Cash and cash equivalents (comprising cash at bank and in hand and short-term deposits) – approximates to the carrying amount stated 
in the accounts.
Financial assets – these are carried at amortised cost using the effective interest method and fair value is deemed to be the same as this.
Short-term loans and overdrafts – approximates to the carrying amount because of the short maturity of these instruments.
Long-term loans – based on quoted market prices in the case of the securitised debt; approximates to the carrying amount in the case 
of the floating rate bank loans and other variable rate borrowings.
Interest rate swaps – calculated by discounting all future cash flows by the market yield curve at the balance sheet date and adjusting for, 
where appropriate, the group’s and counterparty’s credit risk. The changes in credit risk had no material effect on the hedge effectiveness 
assessment for derivatives designated in hedge relationships. Annual report 2015 GREENE KING PLC 97

Carrying values are stated net of any deferred finance fees which amounted to £9.2m (2014: £11.4m).
Hierarchical classification of financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value
IFRS 13 requires that the classification of financial instruments at fair value be determined by reference to the source of inputs used 
to derive fair value.
The classification uses the following three-level hierarchy:
Level 1 – unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
Level 2 – other techniques for which all inputs which have a significant effect on the recorded fair value are observable, either directly 
or indirectly.
Level 3 – techniques which use inputs which have a significant effect on the recorded fair value that are not based on observable market data.
During the periods ending 3 May 2015 and 4 May 2014 there were no transfers between levels 1, 2, or 3 fair value measurements.
Capital risk management
The group aims to maximise shareholder value by maintaining a strong credit rating and a core level of debt which optimises the weighted 
average cost of capital (WACC) and shareholder value.
A number of mechanisms are used to manage debt and equity levels (together referred to as capital), as appropriate in the light of economic 
and trading conditions. To maintain or adjust the capital structure, the group may adjust the dividend payment to shareholders, return 
capital to shareholders or issue new shares. No changes were made in the objectives, policies or processes during the period.
The group monitors capital using interest cover and several other measures including fixed charge cover, the ratio of net debt to EBITDA 
and free cash flow debt service coverage. Interest cover is calculated by dividing operating profit before exceptional items by net finance 
costs before exceptional items (note 7). For the period to 3 May 2015 interest cover was 3.0x (2014: 3.0x). The board’s dividend policy 
is to maintain a minimum dividend cover of two times adjusted basic earnings per share.

Share premium represents the excess of proceeds received over the nominal value of new shares issued.
Capital redemption reserve 
Capital redemption reserve arose from the purchase and cancellation of own share capital, and represents the nominal amount of the share 
capital cancelled.
Hedging reserve
Hedging reserve adjustments arise from the movement in fair value of the group’s derivative instruments used as an effective hedge, in line 
with the accounting policy disclosed in note 1. Amounts recycled to income are included within finance costs in the income statement.
Own shares 
Own shares relates to shares held in treasury, held by the employee benefit trust or purchased to fulfil awards made under the deferred 
share bonus scheme. At 3 May 2015 0.13m shares (2014: 0.53m) were held in treasury, 0.61m shares (2014: 0.55m) were held by the employee 
benefit trust and nil (2014: 0.04m) were held to fulfil awards under the deferred share bonus scheme. The market value at 3 May 2015 of the 
treasury shares was £1.1m (2014: £4.6m), of the shares held by the employee benefit trust was £5.0m (2014: £4.8m) and of the shares held 
for the deferred share bonus scheme was nil (2014: £0.3m). 
The employee benefit trust is independently managed and has purchased shares in order to satisfy outstanding employee share options and 
potential awards under the long-term incentive plan.
At the year end nil (2014: 0.39m) treasury shares and 0.31m (2014: 0.31m) shares in the employee benefit trust were allocated to meet 
awards under the long-term incentive plan.
A transfer of £5.6m (2014: £4.7m) from own shares to retained earnings has been made to reflect transfers to satisfy awards under the 
long-term incentive plan and options exercised under the executive share option plan and reflects the weighted average cost of own shares.
During the period nil (2014: 0.04m) shares were repurchased at a cost of nil (2014: £0.3m) to fulfil awards made under the deferred 
share bonus scheme with 0.04m (2014: 0.04m) shares transferred to individuals to satisfy awards. The employee benefit trust purchased 
0.5m shares (2014: 0.2m) at a cost of £4.2m (2014: £1.6m) and 0.82m (2014: 0.70m) shares were transferred to satisfy awards under 
the long-term incentive plan.

Acquisition of Spirit Pub Company plc
On 23 June 2015 the group completed the acquisition of Spirit Pub Company plc creating the UK’s leading managed pub company.
The group acquired 100% of the share capital of Spirit Pub Company plc for an estimated consideration of £763.1m, made up of 89,095,959 
shares of Greene King plc.
In accordance with the findings of the Competition and Markets Authority review the group is committed to the sale of 16 pubs from 
the combined estate, of which 9 are from the current Greene King estate, to ensure a fair level of competition within all our local markets. 
As part of the deal Greene King has incurred legal and profession fees of £15.2m, all recognised in this financial year. A further £2.1m legal 
and professional fees have been incurred for the issuance of shares as mentioned above.
Given the proximity of the acquisition date to the date of issue of these financial statements management are yet to conclude an assessment 
of the fair value of the assets and liabilities acquired.
32 Contingent liabilities
The group has provided guarantees totalling £1.0m at 3 May 2015 (2014: £1.1m) in respect of free trade customers’ bank borrowings.

INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORT (COMPANY)
To the members of Greene King plc
We have audited the parent company financial statements of Greene King plc for the 52 weeks ended 3 May 2015 which comprise the 
parent company balance sheet and the related notes 33 to 42. The financial reporting framework that has been applied in their preparation 
is applicable law and United Kingdom Accounting Standards (United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice).
This report is made solely to the company’s members, as a body, in accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies Act 2006. 
Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might state to the company’s members those matters we are required to state to them in 
an auditor’s report and for no other purpose. To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility to anyone 
other than the company and the company’s members as a body, for our audit work, for this report, or for the opinions we have formed. 
Respective responsibilities of directors and auditor
As explained more fully in the directors’ responsibilities statement set out on page 61, the directors are responsible for the preparation 
of the parent company financial statements and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view. Our responsibility is to audit and 
express an opinion on the parent company financial statements in accordance with applicable law and International Standards on 
Auditing (UK and Ireland). Those standards require us to comply with the Auditing Practices Board’s Ethical Standards for Auditors.
Scope of the audit of the financial statements
An audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements sufficient to give reasonable assurance 
that the financial statements are free from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or error. This includes an assessment of: whether 
the accounting policies are appropriate to the parent company’s circumstances and have been consistently applied and adequately disclosed; 
the reasonableness of significant accounting estimates made by the directors; and the overall presentation of the financial statements. 
In addition, we read all the financial and non-financial information in the annual report to identify material inconsistencies with the audited 
financial statements and to identify any information that is apparently materially incorrect based on, or materially inconsistent with, the 
knowledge acquired by us in the course of performing the audit. If we become aware of any apparent material misstatements or inconsistencies 
we consider the implications for our report.
Opinion on financial statements
In our opinion the parent company financial statements:
 – give a true and fair view of the state of the company’s affairs as at 3 May 2015;
 – have been properly prepared in accordance with United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice; and
 – have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006.
Opinion on other matters prescribed by the Companies Act 2006
In our opinion:
 – the part of the directors’ remuneration report to be audited has been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 2006; and
 – the information given in the strategic report and the directors’ report for the financial year for which the financial statements 
are prepared is consistent with the parent company financial statements.
Matters on which we are required to report by exception
We have nothing to report in respect of the following matters where the Companies Act 2006 requires us to report to you if, in our opinion:
 – adequate accounting records have not been kept by the parent company, or returns adequate for our audit have not been received 
from branches not visited by us; or
 – the parent company financial statements and the part of the directors’ remuneration report to be audited are not in agreement 
with the accounting records and returns; or
 – certain disclosures of directors’ remuneration specified by law are not made; or
 – we have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit.
Other matter
We have reported separately on the group financial statements of Greene King plc for the 52 weeks ended 3 May 2015.

NOTES TO THE COMPANY ACCOUNTS
For the fifty-two weeks ended 3 May 2015
33 Accounting policies
Basis of accounting and presentation
The accounts are prepared on a going concern basis, in accordance with the Companies Act 2006 and applicable accounting and financial 
reporting standards in the United Kingdom (UK GAAP). They are prepared under the historical cost convention with the exception of 
derivatives, where the company uses interest rate swaps to hedge its exposure to interest rate fluctuations on its variable rate borrowings.
Changes in accounting policy
The accounting policies adopted are consistent with those of the previous financial year.
Investments
Investments in subsidiaries are recorded at cost less impairment and held as fixed assets on the balance sheet. The carrying value of 
investments is reviewed for impairment if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable.
Deferred tax
Deferred tax is recognised in respect of all timing differences that have originated but not reversed at the balance sheet date where 
transactions or events have occurred at that date that will result in an obligation to pay more, or a right to pay less or to receive more tax, 
with the following exceptions: 
 – Provision is made for tax on gains arising from the revaluation (and similar fair value adjustments) of fixed assets, and gains on disposal 
of fixed assets that have rolled over into replacement assets, only to the extent that, at the balance sheet date, there is a binding agreement 
to dispose of the assets concerned. However, no provision is made where, on the basis of all available evidence at the balance sheet date, 
it is more likely than not that the taxable gain will be rolled over into replacement assets and charged to tax only where the replacement 
assets are sold. 
 – Deferred tax assets are recognised only to the extent that the directors consider that it is more likely than not that there will be suitable 
taxable profits from which the future reversal of the underlying timing difference can be deducted.
Deferred tax is measured on an undiscounted basis at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the periods in which timing differences 
reverse, based on tax rates and laws enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
Financial instruments
Financial instruments are recognised when the company becomes party to the contractual provisions of the instrument and are 
de-recognised when the company no longer controls the contractual rights that comprise the financial instrument, normally through 
sale or when all cash flows attributable to the instrument are passed to an independent third party.
The company is exempt, in accordance with FRS 29.2D, from producing disclosure required by the standard as the group accounts contain 
disclosure that complies with FRS 29 (IFRS 7).
Interest-bearing loans and borrowings
All loans and borrowings are initially recognised at fair value of the consideration received, net of issue costs. After initial recognition, 
interest-bearing loans and borrowings are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method.
Derivative financial instruments and hedge accounting
The company uses interest rate swaps to hedge its exposure to interest rate fluctuations on its variable rate borrowings.
Interest rate swaps are initially measured at fair value, if any, and carried on the balance sheet as an asset or liability. Subsequent 
measurement is at fair value determined by reference to market values for similar instruments. If a derivative does not qualify for hedge 
accounting the gain or loss arising on the movement in fair value is recognised in the profit and loss account.
Hedge accounting
To qualify for hedge accounting the hedge relationship must be designated and documented at inception. Documentation must include 
the company’s risk management objective and strategy for undertaking the hedge and formal allocation to the item or transaction being 
hedged. The company also documents how it will assess the effectiveness of the hedge and carries out assessments on a regular basis 
to determine whether it has been, and is likely to continue to be, highly effective.
Hedges can be classified as either fair value (hedging exposure to changes in fair value of an asset or liability) or cash flow (hedging the 
variability in cash flows attributable to an asset, liability, or forecast transaction). The company uses its interest rate swaps as cash flow hedges.
For these cash flow hedges, the effective portion of the gain or loss on the hedging instrument is recognised directly in equity, while the 
ineffective portion is recognised in the profit and loss account. Amounts taken to equity are transferred to the profit and loss account when 
the hedged transaction affects profit or loss. 
If a forecast transaction is no longer expected to occur, amounts previously recognised in equity are transferred to profit or loss. If the 
hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated or exercised without replacement or rollover, or if its designation as a hedge is revoked, 
amounts previously recognised in equity remain in equity until the forecast transaction occurs and are then transferred to the profit and 
loss account as above. If the related transaction is not expected to occur, the amount is taken to profit and loss.
Own shares
Own shares consist of treasury shares and shares held within an employee benefit trust. The company has an employee benefit trust 
for the granting of shares to applicable employees. 
Own shares are recognised at cost as a deduction from equity shareholders’ funds. Subsequent consideration received for the sale of such 
shares is also recognised in equity, with any difference between the sale proceeds and the original cost being taken to revenue reserves. 
No gain or loss is recognised in the performance statements on transactions in treasury shares. GREENE KING PLC Annual report 2015 104
Financial statements
NOTES TO THE COMPANY ACCOUNTS CONTINUED
For the fifty-two weeks ended 3 May 2015
33 Accounting policies continued
Share-based payments
Certain employees and directors of subsidiary companies receive equity-settled remuneration, whereby they render services in exchange 
for shares or rights over shares. The fair value of the shares and options granted is measured using a Black-Scholes model, at the date at 
which they were granted. No account is taken in the fair value calculation of any vesting conditions (service and performance), other than 
market conditions (performance linked to the price of the shares of the company). Any other conditions that are required to be met in order 
for an employee to become fully entitled to an award are considered non-vesting conditions. Like market performance, non-vesting conditions 
are taken into account in determining the grant date fair value. The fair value of shares and options granted is recognised as an increase 
in the company’s investments in its subsidiaries with a corresponding increase in equity spread over the period in which the performance 
conditions are fulfilled ending on the relevant vesting date. The cumulative amount recognised as an investment reflects the extent 
to which the vesting period has expired, adjusted for the estimated number of shares and options that are ultimately expected to vest. 
Related party transactions
In accordance with FRS 8 Related Party Disclosures the company is not required to disclose transactions with its wholly owned subsidiaries.
34 Profit for the period
No profit or loss account is presented for the company as permitted by section 408 of the Companies Act 2006. The profit after tax for the period 
is £225.3m (2014: £10.6m).
35 Auditor’s remuneration
Auditor’s remuneration in respect of the company audit was £16,500 (2014: £16,300).
36 Directors’ remuneration and employee costs
Details of directors’ remuneration is contained in the directors’ remuneration report on page 50. The company has no employees other 
than directors and the directors are not remunerated through this company. Details of share options issued by the company are given 
in note 8 to the group accounts.
The directors do not believe that it is practicable to apportion these amounts between their services as directors of the company and their 
services as directors of other group companies.

Indirect investors’ information rights
Beneficial owners of shares held on their behalf by a different registered

They have the right to ask their registered holder to nominate them to 
receive all non-personalised information distributed to shareholders, in 
accordance with the provisions of section 146 of the Companies Act 2006.
Should you wish to be nominated to receive information from 
Greene King directly, please contact your registered holder, who 
will need to notify our registrars, Capita Asset Services, accordingly. 
Please note that, once nominated, beneficial owners of shares must 
continue to direct all communications regarding those shares to 
the registered holder of those shares rather than to the registrars 
or to Greene King directly.

Chairman’s Statement
My	fir st	full	y ear	as	Chairman	t o	June	
2009 has required Finsbury to negotiate 
the	most	difficult	ec onomic	and	tr ading	
environment since listing on AIM in 2002. 
We have grown our Group quickly since 
inception by focusing on strong above 
market growth trends for premium and 
healthy bakery products. The current 
recession has negatively impacted both 
these sectors’ growth trends, we believe 
t empor arily ,	and	nec essitat ed	fle xing	
of	our	pr oduct	off ering	and	oper ating	
strategies during 2009 to meet customer 
and consumer trends towards more value 
conscious food consumption.
Business Performance
Given these conditions, our ability to 
gr o w	sales	8%	ahead	of	last	y ear	(2%	on	
a	lik e	f or	lik e	basis)	is	enc our aging	and	
demonstrates the resilience and spread 
of our businesses. However, our operating 
margin declined by 2% as a consequence 
of these market conditions, namely 
consumer purchasing being more value 
and	pr omotion	led,	and	difficulty	in	
r ec o v ering	sufficient	r aw	mat erial	and	
oper ating	c ost	inflation	fr om	cust omer s.
Combined sales from our larger cake 
manufacturing sites were up 2% on the 
prior year, in line with the ambient cake 
market, representing a strong relative 
performance given our greater exposure 
to the higher unit cost premium, 
celebration and healthy sectors most 
impacted by a ‘cash strapped’ consumer. 
Our lower unit price licensed cake brands 
portfolio allowed us to adapt quickly 
to changing consumer behaviour. 
Thorntons branded cakes grew by over 
70% in the year, making it the fastest 
growing brand in the cake market, and 
WeightWatchers branded cakes achieved 
25% sales growth, bucking a decline in 
the overall ambient healthy cake market.
The combined sales from our smaller 
br ead	and	fr ee	fr om	sit es	r eflect	a	str ong	
year with growth of 14% on a like for like 
basis.	W e	benefit ed	fr om	c onsolidating	
our leading position in the fast growing 
free from market, with the acquisition of 
Livwell in April 2008, which is now fully 
integrated with United Central Bakeries 
(UCB).	Nicholas	&	Harris’	speciality	br ead	
business	also	gr ew	significantly	and,	with	
the acquisition of Goswell Enterprises 
L t d	in	June	2009,	has	str engthened	its	
speciality breads licensed portfolio with 
brands such as Vogel and Cranks.
I would like to take this opportunity to 
thank	all	our	staff	f or	their	c ontinued	
commitment and passion which has 
seen	us	thr ough	our	most	difficult	tr ading	
period to date.
Funding and Dividend
New debt and banking facilities have 
been put in place with our bankers, HSBC 
Bank	Plc,	t o	r eflect	the	needs	of	the	
business in the current environment. The 
Board has decided not to recommend 
paying a dividend this year. With limited 
funding available, we continue to invest to 
gr o w	our	business.	W e	r emain	c onfident	
in the potential of the business and 
int end	t o	r e-establish	the	dividend	as	
soon	as	cash	flo w	and	debt	le v els	allo w .
Board Changes
Following the departure of Dave Brooks 
at the end of September last year, I 
would like to thank Martin Lightbody 
for assuming the role of Chief Executive 
Offic er	o v er	the	last	12	months	and	
steering the Group through a tough 
trading period. He has been ably assisted 
by	J ohn	Duffy	whom	w e	r ecruit ed	t o	
strengthen the management team in a 
new	r ole	of	Chief	Oper ating	Offic er .
Having largely completed the business 
integration, it is now the right time to 
restructure the Board for the long term. 
To that end, and with the full support  
of the Board, I have invited Martin to 
r eplac e	me	as	Non-Ex ecutiv e	Chairman	
following the Annual General Meeting  
on 25 November 2009. I will remain  
on the Board and revert to being a 
Non-Ex ecutiv e	Deputy	Chairman.	 
J ohn	Duffy	will	be	joining	the	Boar d	 
with	immediat e	eff ect	as	the	new	 
Gr oup	Chief	Ex ecutiv e	Offic er .
Outlook
Trading conditions are unlikely to improve 
significantly	in	the	shor t	t erm	with	
unemployment rising and a generally 
fragile economic operating environment. 
Our businesses and their customers will 
face continued uncertainty in factors 
such as interest rates and the strength 
of sterling. However, we have probably 
weathered the worst part of the recession 
already and demonstrated the resilience 
of the food market and the Group’s 
businesses in doing so. 
W e will increase investment in understanding our markets and 
consumer needs to better target innovation utilising our unique 
strong quality baking heritage and licensed brands portfolio. Targeted 
investment in capacity in areas such as free from fresh bread coupled 
with further integration of Group businesses and supply chain 
efficiency projects will accelerate a return to profitable growth.

Chief Executive’s Report 7 Finsbury Food Group Plc Annual Report 2009
I am pleased with the way we have responded to the challenges 
over the last 12 months, growing Group sales despite our 
premium range focus, and whilst short term profit reduced, 
this is being addressed, as reflected in our improved second 
half performance. 
Entering a full blown recession after a 
period	of	r apid	input	pric e	inflation	was	
not necessarily the ideal time to step 
int o	the	CE O	r ole.	It	has	been	a	difficult	
year for our young Group. The tough 
trading climate encouraged us to force 
the pace on internal integration whilst 
simultaneously	adjusting	pr oduct	r anges,	
operating and sales strategies to meet 
consumers’ changing buying habits. I am 
pleased with the way we have responded 
to the challenges over the last 12 months, 
growing Group sales despite our premium 
r ange	f ocus,	and	whilst	shor t	t erm	pr ofit	
reduced, this is being addressed, as 
r eflect ed	in	our	impr o v ed	sec ond	half	
performance.
Performance
Results for the 53 week period ended

The Group is now more streamlined and

and overhead services. Considerable 
investment has been made during the 
year in senior management, systems and 
pr oc esses	t o	r eflect	gr o wing	scale	and	
customer expectations.
Future Prospects
We are not anticipating any let up in the 
curr ent	difficult	tr ading	envir onment	
in	the	shor t	t erm	but	r emain	c onfident	
that if we continue to invest in our more 
integrated subsidiaries, people and 
facilities, as well as in our customers’ 
requirements, we will exit this recession 
a stronger business.
Our market positions are good and 
we are have adapted well to changing 
consumer needs by focusing on relevant 
innovation and product quality utilising 
our unique craft baking experience.
We also see organic growth and bolt on 
acquisition opportunities in our core 
everyday premium and ‘better for you’ 
market segments. I remain excited about 
the prospects for the business.

Business Review
Strategy
Our business strategy is to generate 
returns for shareholders by building 
a crafted bakery group focused on 
premium, celebration and well being that 
delivers for customers and consumers. 
We will continue to develop our licensed 
brand portfolio to complement our core 
retailer brand relationships and improve 
our understanding of and response to 
changing consumer needs.
We are still a modest manufacturer in 
the total bakery market in which we 
operate and see exciting organic growth 
opportunities in all our businesses.
Whilst our short term focus is on 
integrating and growing our existing 
businesses, we aim to take advantage 
of the right bolt on acquisitions to drive 
longer term value as opportunities and 
circumstance allow.
Our Markets
We operate in large markets with 
combined sales in excess of £4 billion 
per annum. We continue to lead our 
core areas within those markets, where 
ther e	r emains	significant	oppor tunity	f or	
growth by converting consumers to our 
product range.
The total annual UK ambient cake market 
(including	pr e-pack ed	cak e	and	in-st or e	
bak er y)	is	v alued	at	£1.5	billion.	The	past	
12 months has seen value growth slow 
t o	2%	(sour c e:	A C	Nielsen)	with	a	decline	
in	v olume	of	just	o v er	1%.	W e	c ontinue	
to be the second largest supplier of cake 
to the UK’s multiple grocers, with a 20% 
s h a r e 	 o f 	 t h e 	 t o t a l 	 p r e - p a c k e d 	 c a k e 	 m a r k e t ,	
and have maintained our leading position 
in the niche areas on which we focus. 
Annual bread sales are in excess of 
£3	billion	(sour c e:	Mint el).	W e	ar e	a	
smaller player in this market, with a focus 
on speciality and organic bread products, 
and	w e	hav e	c ontinued	t o	benefit	fr om	
the growth in demand for our products, 
despite the tough economic climate and 
a general decline in organic bread sales.
Moving to free from, the total gluten free 
mark et	is	ar ound	£180	million	(sour c e:	
A C	Nielsen),	with	gr o wth	of	c15%	in	
the last year. The area of this market in 
which we operate i.e. bread, cake and 
other bakery products, accounts for c£20 
million of these sales, with growth of 8% 
year on year. The bakery sector growth 
lags behind the total gluten free market 
growth because of a perceived lower 
quality versus standard bread. We are 
addressing this via the Genius brand and 
a range of fresh free from bread products.
Our Business
The Group consists of a maturing 
collection of businesses acquired over a 
number of years. Our focus over the last 
y ear	has	been	t o	achie v e	a	mor e	eff ectiv e	
integration of these businesses. The main 
aspects of this have been:
the centralising of our Group •	
purchasing function
recruitment of a Group •	
Technical Director
integration of Goswells •	
integration of our two free from •	
manufacturing businesses
integration of our cake •	
manufacturing businesses
Lightbody	Gr oup	L t d	(‘Lightbody’),	based	
in Hamilton, employs around 1,100 
people and is the UK’s largest supplier 
of celebration cake. It also produces a 
range of small cakes, a number of which 
are under our licensed brands including 
Thorntons and WeightWatchers. 
Memor y	Lane	Cak es	L t d	(‘Memor y	Lane’),	
based	in	Car diff,	emplo y s	ar ound	1,000	
people and is the leading manufacturer 
of the UK retailers’ premium own label 
cake ranges.
Calif ornia	Cak es	L t d	(‘Calif ornia’)	and	
Anthony	Alan	F oods	L t d	(‘ Anthony	Alan’)	
are now fully integrated into these two 
larger cake businesses and Campbells 
Cak e	Company	L t d	(‘Campbells’),	
our smallest site, is now under the 
management of the Lightbody team.
Sales revenues within the integrated cake 
businesses have continued to increase

Finsbury Food Group Plc Annual Report 2009 9
a range of gluten free bakery products, 
yum yums and potato scones. It has 
recently launched two new fresh gluten 
free breads under the Genius brand, 
tr ansf orming	the	glut en	fr ee	off ering	
within the bread sector. 
Livw ell	L t d	(‘Livw ell’),	based	in	Hull,	
employs around 100 people and is the 
UK’s leading supplier of gluten free bread, 
cake and morning goods to the UK’s 
grocery retailers. It continues to deliver 
new products into the free from market, 
such as pain au chocolat and ciabatta. 
This business operates under a combined 
commercial team with UCB.
Nicholas	&	Harris	L t d	(‘N&H’),	based	in	
Salisbury, employs around 200 people 
and produces a range of speciality  
bread products to the UK retailers.  
It has maintained its leadership position 
in	the	supply	of	‘clean-label’	br eads.	This	
position has been strengthened following 
its acquisition of Goswell Enterprises Ltd 
(‘Gosw ells’)	in	June	and	with	it	a	number	
of licensed brands including Vogel and 
Cr anks.	A	significant	pr opor tion	of	the	
Group capital investment was targeted 
t o	N&H	t o	f acilitat e	the	int egr ation	of	
Goswells into the site in Salisbury.
Growth in sales revenues within both 
the bread and free from businesses has 
continued to accelerate with a combined 
incr ease	of	47%.	The	full	y ear	eff ect	of	
acquisitions accounts for 32% of this with 
the remainder due to organic growth 
within	UCB	and	N&H.	
Brands and Licences
The Group remains primarily a retailer 
branded business, with sales of retailer 
own label products accounting for  
around 70% of our total revenue.  
We have, however, seen an increase  
in the proportion of sales of branded 
pr oducts.	This	r eflects	the	str ength	of	 
the licensed brands under our control 
and the fact that, in a number of cases, 
they have outperformed the rest of  
the market.
WeightWatchers
WeightWatchers is the 14th largest food 
brand in the UK and we hold the licence 
to manufacture and distribute low fat 
cake to the UK and Ireland’s multiple 
grocers under this brand. Since the 
acquisition of Anthony Alan in 2007,  
the brand has been developed through 
utilisation of the broad production 
capability within the Group and our skills 
in developing new products that adhere 
to brand guidelines. WeightWatchers  
now accounts for 69% of the low fat cake 
market in terms of value, representing 
y ear	on	y ear	gr o wth	of	25%	–	a	significant	
achievement in the context of 0.5% 
reduction in the overall value of that 
market.
Thorntons
The Group continues to develop its 
br anded	off ering	within	the	pr emium	
cake sector via its licensing arrangement 
with the Thorntons confectionery 
business. Through a combination of 
new product development, additional 
listings of existing products and targeted 
promotional activity, the Thorntons brand 
within cake has seen growth of 71% year 
on	y ear .	This	r epr esents	significant	out-
performance of the rest of the premium 
cake market, which saw a 2.5% decline in 
total sales year on year. 
We have recently launched two new 
products and we will continue to invest 
in the brand to increase awareness and 
driv e	fur ther	pr ofitable	gr o wth	f or	both	 
us and our customers.
Nestlé Confectionery
W e	c ontinue	t o	benefit	fr om	the	rights	
to manufacture and distribute cake 
products under Nestlé confectionery 
br ands	such	as	Smar ties,	J elly	T ots	and	
Munchies. 
Disney
Our rights to use the Disney brand extend 
to the Pixar movies and complement our 
market position within celebration cake. 
Brands within the portfolio such as High 
School Musical have been particularly 
successful for us over the past year and 
we expect that Toy Story will lead our 
drive to realise further growth within this 
sector over the coming months.
Other Celebration Cake Licences
These 	 f our 	 major 	 br ands 	 ar e 	 c omplement ed

Bread Licences
W e	ar e	pleased	t o	hav e	br anded	off erings	
in our bread and free from businesses. 
The Village Bakery is an organic brand 
which	N&H	has	been	w orking	with	f or	
a number of years, generating sales of 
around £1 million per annum. The range 
is based primarily around clean label rye 
breads and lines are stocked by all our 
bread customers. The Vogel brand covers 
a range of natural sliced breads with 
added rye, grains and seeds to improve 
the health attributes of the product. The 
rights to manufacture products under this 
brand came along with the acquisition 
of	Gosw ells	in	June	and	c omplements	
the mainly own label range of products 
within	N&H’s	por tf olio .	This	ac quisition	
also brought with it the Cranks licence 
to manufacture a range of organic 
vegetarian bread products.
Genius is a new brand within the free 
from market and at UCB we have helped 
de v elop	the	fir st	‘mass	mark et’	fr esh	
gluten free bread that looks, smells and 
tastes like ‘real’ bread. Two products were 
launched	with	a	major	r etailer	in	April	
this year on an exclusive basis and sales 
to date have exceeded our expectations, 
as well as those of our customer and 
the brand owner. There are a number 
of range extensions in the development 
‘pipeline’ and we are embarking on a 
£2	million	capital	inv estment	pr oject	
at UCB to increase the manufacturing 
capacity to deal with these along with 
the roll out to other customers when 
the exclusivity period ends in October.
Principal Operating Risks
In the course of its normal business the 
Group is exposed to a number of risks and 
uncertainties which could impact the results 
of the Group. A formal review of these risks is 
carried out by the Group on an annual basis. 
The 	 r e view 	 pr oc ess 	 inv olv es 	 the 	 identification 	
of current risks, assessment to determine 
the relative likelihood of them impacting the 
business and the potential severity of the 
impact, and determination of what needs to 
be 	 done 	 t o 	 manage 	 them 	 eff ectiv ely .
The 	 dir ect or s 	 hav e 	 identified 	 the 	 f ollo wing 	
principal risks and uncertainties that could 
hav e 	 the 	 most 	 significant 	 impact 	 on 	 the 	
Group’s value generation.
Product Quality
Product quality is a key strength of the Group 
and failure to maintain a high standard of 
food quality and safety would have a severe 
impact on service levels and customer 
relationships.
The Group’s quality assurance procedures, 
managed at site level, are reviewed 
continuously with improvements made 
as appropriate. The Group has recruited a 
Group T echnical Director to help ensure 
continuous improvement across all sites to 
meet the increasingly high expectations of 
our customers. The operating subsidiaries are 
subject 	 t o 	 r egular 	 int ernal 	 and 	 independent	
food safety and quality control audits 
including those carried out by, or on behalf 
of, their customers. The Group maintains 
product recall insurance cover to mitigate the 
potential impact of such an occurrence.
Raw Materials – Prices 
and Supply
Increases in the price of raw materials can 
adv er sely	impact	the	c or e	pr ofitability	of	
the business and any related shortage in 
supply will impact the business’ ability to 
maintain its service levels to customers – 
another of its key performance indicators. 
The prices of certain key commodities 
(e.g.	sugar)	ar e	tied	t o	the	eur o	–	the	
relative strength of sterling will, therefore, 
have an impact on the cost of these.
The Group will aim to pass on increased 
costs to its customers as far as is 
reasonable in the circumstances 
whilst maintaining its tight control of 
overhead costs to mitigate the impact 
on consumers. The Group maintains a 
high level of expertise in its buying team 
and will consider long term contracts 
where appropriate to reduce uncertainty 
in input prices. The team also cultivates 
str ong	r elationships	with	its	major	
suppliers to ensure continuity of supply 
at competitive prices. Regular renovation 
and innovation in our product range can 
help to manage margin pressures in an 
eff ectiv e	manner	as	f ar	as	the	c ompetitiv e	
environment allows.
Finsbury Food Group Plc Annual Report 2009 11
Economic Environment
Whilst the price sensitivity of our products 
is relatively low, there have been some 
particular trends in the premium and 
health sectors of the cake market that 
have impacted the demand for products 
within these sectors. The recessionary 
environment has resulted in demand 
from customers for increased levels 
of support via promotional activity as 
they	c ompet e	with	each	other	t o	off er	
consumers greater value for money.
The Group has taken steps to improve the 
assessment of this promotional support 
to ensure an acceptable level of return 
on this expenditure. The strength of the 
brands at our disposal has also helped to 
mitigat e	the	impact	–	this	is	r eflect ed	in	
the growth we have seen in Thorntons 
and WeightWatchers, in particular.
Input Costs
Input costs have continued to impact the 
Gr oup’s	pr ofitability .	Whilst	the	pr essur e	
on some commodities has eased during 
the year, the ongoing prices remain 
significantly	higher	than	they	w er e	and	
a number of raw materials key to our 
product range have increased, such as 
chocolate, egg and sugar.
W e	hav e	also	seen	a	significant	incr ease	
in the cost of utilities year on year. An 
‘on cost’ of c£1 million represents a 40% 
incr ease	on	the	pr e vious	financial	y ear .
Trading Results
Changes have been made to our 
presentation of revenue and cost of 
sales	f or	this	y ear’s	financial	stat ements.	
Revenue is now reported after deducting 
sales	o v er -rider s	and	r ebat es	pay able	
to customers as well as promotional 
discounts. Cost of sales now includes 
direct distribution costs and royalties 
payable to our brand licensors as well 
as material and direct labour costs. 
The calculation of gross margin is 
also changed as a result. Prior year 
c ompar able	figur es	hav e	been	r estat ed	so	
that the year on year movement may be 
properly assessed.
Group revenue for the 53 week period to 
4	July	2009	was	£178.9	million	(52	w eek	
period	t o	28	June	2008:	£165.1	million),	
an	incr ease	of	£13.8	million	(8.4%)	y ear	
on year. Like for like sales from continuing 
operations, excluding the incremental 
sales from the business acquired during 
the	y ear	(namely	Gosw ells),	the	full	y ear	
eff ect	of	prior	y ear	ac quisitions	(namely	
Livw ell	and	Anthony	Alan)	and	the	e xtr a	
53rd week of trading, were £168.2 million. 
This represents an increase of £3.1 million 
(1.9%)	y ear	on	y ear .
Gr oss	mar gin	f or	the	financial	y ear	was	
27.2%	(2008:	26.8%)	r epr esenting	an	
increase of 0.4% year on year. The full 
year impact of price increases achieved 
in	the	prior	y ear	has	been	off set	by	
further rises in input costs during the year 
that we were unable to pass on to our 
customers.
Administrative expenses increased by 
£7.1	million	y ear	on	y ear .	The	major	
contributing factors to this increase were:
£2.1 million relating to the full year •	
eff ect	of	Livw ell
£1.0 million increase in utilities costs •	
£1.1 million increase in sales •	
administration and marketing 
related expenses

Cash Flow
The	Gr oup	r ealised	a	net	cash	inflo w	fr om	
operating activities of £8.2 million during 
the	financial	y ear	(2008:	£5.9	million)	
representing an increase of 38% on the 
pr e vious	financial	y ear .
There was a reduction in our working 
capital requirement of £2.7 million 
c ompar ed	t o	the	last	financial	 
y ear	r eflecting	the	impact	of	an	 
increased focus in this area over  
the past 12 months. 
Corporation tax payments made in  
the 	 financial 	 y ear 	 t otalled 	 £0.8 	 million	
( 2 0 0 8 : 	 £ 2 . 2 	 m i l l i o n ) 	 – 	 t h e s e 	 p a y m e n t s 	 t o o k	
account of the research and development 
tax 	 r elief 	 due 	 t o 	 the 	 Gr oup 	 and 	 identified 	 in	
the 	 pr e vious 	 financial 	 y ear .
Capital expenditure in the period 
amounted to £3.4 million net of disposals 
(2008:	£2.4	million).	£1.1	million	was	
spent	at	N&H	–	this	was	nec essar y	t o	
facilitate its acquisition of Goswells and 
the associated transfer of production. 
£0.8 million was spent at UCB with 
the	majority	of	this	in	pr epar ation	f or	
the development of its existing spare 
manufacturing facility. 
Debt and Bank Facilities
The Group’s total net debt as at  
4 	 July 	 2009 	 was 	 £41.0 	 million	 
(28 	 June 	 2008: 	 £43.7 	 million) 	 including	
net borrowings from HSBC Bank Plc and 
guaranteed loan notes only. Within this 
total net debt, £14.5 million is due within 
one 	 y ear , 	 including 	 inv oic e 	 financ e 	 and	
loan 	 not es 	 pay able 	 on 	 demand 	 (2008:	
£12.8 	 million). 	 Net 	 debt 	 in 	 this 	 instanc e	
excludes deferred consideration payable  
in respect of acquisitions.
During the year the Group agreed revised 
terms on its debt facility with HSBC Bank 
Plc. This process was completed in March 
2009 	 and 	 the 	 r e vised 	 f acility 	 t ook 	 eff ect 	
from April 2009. 
The key features of the revised facility, 
totalling £49 million, are as follows:
o v er dr aft 	 (£2.0 	 million) •	
c onfidential 	 inv oic e 	 disc ounting 	 f acility	 •	
(£16.0 	 million 	 fle xible)
tw o 	 t erm 	 loans 	 r epay able 	 o v er 	 fiv e	 •	
y ear s 	 (£12.9 	 million)
two term loans repayable at the end of •	
fiv e 	 y ear s 	 (£4.7 	 million)
mortgage unchanged from current •	
f acility 	 (£8.2 	 million)
r olling 	 asset 	 financ e 	 f acility 	 (£5.4 	 million) •	
There has been some movement in the 
interest rate margins on this revised facility 
and the new term loans are linked to LIBOR. 
The margins on the remaining items under 
the facility are linked to the base rate. The 
impact 	 of 	 these 	 changes 	 on 	 our 	 eff ectiv e 	
interest rate was to increase it by 1.1%.
Finsbury Food Group Plc Annual Report 2009 16
The	Gr oup	is	able	t o	off er	str ong	asset	
backing to secure its borrowings. The 
Group owns freehold sites at Memory 
Lane	in	Car diff,	at	Lightbody ,	UCB	and	
Campbells in Scotland, and at Livwell in 
Hull. In addition, the Group has a strong 
trade debtor book to support the invoice 
discounting facility, made up primarily 
of	the	UK’s	major	multiple	r etailer s. 
This debtor book stood at £21.9 million 
(2008:	£23.0	million)	at	the	balanc e 
sheet date.
The Group recognises the inherent risk 
from interest rate rises. To mitigate these 
risks, the Group has four interest rate 
swaps in place with a total coverage of 
£19.0 	 million 	 (equiv alent 	 t o 	 46% 	 of	
t o t a l 	 n e t 	 d e b t ) 	 a t 	 a 	 w e i g h t e d 	 a v e r a g e	
r at e 	 of 	 5.3%. 	 In 	 June, 	 a 	 f orwar d 	 starting	
participating swap arrangement was 
e n t e r e d 	 i n t o 	 – 	 t h i s 	 t a k e s 	 e ff e c t 	 i n 	 J u n e	
2010 and runs for four years from 
that date. 
The	eff ectiv e	int er est	r at e	f or	the	Gr oup	
at the year end, taking account of the 
interest rate swaps in place and with base 
rate at 0.5%, was 5.26%. 
Financial Covenants
The	Boar d	r e view s	the	Gr oup’s	cash	flo w	
forecasts and key covenants on a regular 
basis to ensure that it has adequate 
facilities to cover its trading and banking 
requirements with an appropriate level 
of headroom. The forecasts are based 
on management’s best estimates of 
future trading.
Int er est	c o v er	(based	on	adjust ed	EBITD A)	
f or	the	y ear	t o	30	June	2009	was	4.7	
(2008:	4.9).	Net	debt	t o	EBITD A	(based	on	
adjust ed	EBITD A)	f or	the	y ear	t o	30	June	
2009	was	3.9	(2008:	3.3).	
It should be noted that whilst current 
liabilities of £49.9 million, as shown in the 
c onsolidat ed	balanc e	sheet	at	30	June	
2009, exceed current assets of £30.5 
million, there is no foreseeable reason 
why the Group will not be able to meet its 
current liabilities as they become due. 
Taxation
The Group corporation tax charge for the 
y ear	was	£0.4	million	(2008:	£1.0	million).	
This	r epr esents	an	eff ectiv e	r at e	of	21.4%	
(2008:	20.3%).	
Further details on the tax charge can be 
f ound	in	not e	9	t o	the	Gr oup’s	financial

based	on	mark et	v alue	at	the	balanc e	sheet	dat e,	the	liabilities	ar e	based	on	actuarial	assumptions	such	as	disc ount,	inflation	and	
mortality rates. The assumptions applied are based on advice provided by the Scheme’s actuary. Further detail can be found in 
note 15.
 The Group recognises provisions where an obligation exists at the balance sheet date and a reliable estimate can be made. •

The onerous lease extends to April 2012 and has been provided for on the assumption that no tenant will be found until the 
termination date. Reorganisation costs are provided for on the basis of best estimates of future costs. Estimates for employee 
claims are made based on the number of reported accidents and incidents and the number of expected claims yet to be reported 
based on historical evidence, all accrued up to the maximum self insured amount of £10,000 per claim.
 The Group retains all the risks and rewards of the underlying trade debt and therefore, continues to recognise the gross debtor •	
balance. Cash received is shown as a current liability under invoice discounting.
 At the inception of the interest rate swaps, the management made an assessment as to whether or not they would qualify for •	
hedge accounting and determined that they did not.
Basis of Consolidation
Subsidiaries are entities controlled by the Group. Control exists when the Group has the power, directly or indirectly, to govern the 
financial	and	oper ating	policies	of	an	entity	so	as	t o	obtain	benefits	fr om	its	activities.	In	assessing	c ontr ol,	pot ential	v oting	rights

tr ansactions	ar e	eliminat ed	in	pr eparing	the	c onsolidat ed	financial	stat ements.
Lightbody Stretz Ltd which is 50% owned by the Group has been consolidated into the Group accounts as a subsidiary with a 
corresponding minority interest on the basis that the Group has the controlling interest. Control arises by virtue of the fact that 
Lightbody	Gr oup ,	a	wholly	o wned	subsidiar y	of	Finsbur y	F ood	Gr oup ,	has	a	majority	of	v oting	rights	arising	fr om	an	agr eement	
between Lightbody Group Limited and Philippe Stretz. 
Foreign Currency
Transactions in foreign currencies are translated to the functional currency of Group entities at the foreign exchange rate ruling at the 
date of the transaction. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at the balance sheet date are retranslated to 
the functional currency at the foreign exchange rate ruling at that date.

of foreign operations are translated at an average rate for the year where this rate approximates to the foreign exchange rates ruling at 
the dates of the transactions. This revaluation is recognised through the consolidated statement of recognised income and expenses.

at their fair value. Fair value is deemed to be market value and changes in the market value have been recognised through the 
c onsolidat ed	inc ome	stat ement	as	financial	inc ome	or	e xpense.
Non-Derivative Financial Instruments
Non-deriv ativ e	financial	instruments	c omprise	inv estments	in	equity	and	debt	securities,	tr ade	and	other	r ec eiv ables,	cash	and	cash	
equivalents, loans and borrowings, and trade and other payables.
Trade and other Receivables
Trade and other receivables are initially recognised at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost. This value is deemed to 
be the amount that would be received if the debt was cleared on the balance sheet date.
Trade and other Payables
Trade and other payables are initially recognised at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost. This value is deemed to 
be the value that would be payable to settle the liability at the balance sheet date.
Cash and Cash Equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash balances and call deposits. Bank overdrafts that are repayable on demand and form an 
integral part of the Group’s cash management are included as a component of cash and cash equivalents.
Interest-Bearing Borrowings

liability at the balance sheet date less unamortised attributable transaction costs.
Property, Plant and Equipment
Recognition and Measurement
Items of property, plant and equipment are measured at cost or fair value at the date of acquisition, less accumulated depreciation 
and	impairment	pr o visions.	Costs	include	e xpenditur e	that	is	dir ectly	attributable	t o	the	ac quisition	asset.	The	c ost	of	self-c onstruct ed	
assets includes the cost of materials and direct labour and any other costs directly attributable to bringing the asset to a working 
condition for its intended use, and the costs of dismantling and removing the items and restoring the site on which they are located. 
Purchased software that is integral to the functionality of the related equipment is capitalised as part of that equipment.
Depreciation
Depr eciation	is	pr o vided	t o	writ e	off	the	c ost,	less	estimat ed	r esidual	v alue,	of	the	pr oper ty ,	plant	and	equipment	by	equal	instalments

Intangible Assets and Goodwill
Goodwill 	 is 	 stat ed 	 at 	 c ost 	 less 	 any 	 ac cumulat ed 	 impairment 	 losses. 	 Goodwill 	 is 	 allocat ed 	 t o 	 cash-gener ating 	 units 	 and 	 is 	 not 	 amor tised 	 but 	 is

Impairment
The carrying amounts of the Group’s assets are reviewed at each balance sheet date to determine whether there is an indication of 
impairment. 	 A 	 financial 	 asset 	 is 	 c onsider ed 	 t o 	 be 	 impair ed 	 if 	 objectiv e 	 e videnc e 	 indicat es 	 that 	 one 	 or 	 mor e 	 e v ents 	 hav e 	 had 	 a 	 negativ e 	 eff ect

Calculation of Recoverable Amount
The recoverable amount is the greater of their fair values less costs to sell and value in use. In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash

and 	 the 	 risks 	 specific 	 t o 	 the 	 asset.
Reversals of Impairment
An impairment loss in respect of goodwill is not reversed.
Deferred Consideration
The provision for deferred consideration is initially stated at the net present value of the expected future payment and the discount is accrued 
by increasing the amount of the provision up to the expected payment date. The charge relating to the unwinding of the discount is recorded 
within 	 financ e 	 c osts.
Contingent Deferred Consideration
Contingent deferred consideration arising on business combinations is estimated by the directors based on the expected outcome of 
performance related criteria. The provision is initially stated at the net present value of the expected future payment and the discount is 
accrued by increasing the amount of the provision up to the expected payment date. The charge relating to the unwinding of the discount is 
r ec or ded 	 within 	 financ e 	 c osts.
Government Grants
Government grants relating to property, plant and equipment are treated as deferred income and released to the income statement over the 
expected useful lives of the assets concerned. Other grants are credited to the income statement as the related expenditure is incurred.

Share-Based Payment Transactions
The value, as at the grant date, of options granted to employees is recognised as an employee expense, with a corresponding increase 
in equity, over the period in which the employees become unconditionally entitled to the options. The fair value of the options granted 
is measured using an option valuation model, taking into account the terms and conditions upon which the options were granted. The 
amount	r ec ognised	as	an	e xpense	is	adjust ed	t o	r eflect	the	actual	number	of	shar e	options	that	v est.
The Group and Company took advantage of the option available in IFRS 1 to apply IFRS 2 only to equity instruments that were granted 
aft er	7	No v ember	2002	and	that	had	not	v est ed	by	1	July	2006.
The	Company	has	used	the	QCA-IRS	option	v aluer	TM	(based	on	the	Black-Scholes-Mer t on	based	option	pricing	model)	t o	calculat e	
the fair value of the outstanding options. This model was developed by the QCA partnered with Independent Remuneration Solutions 
(IRS)	and	City	Gr oup	Plc.	The	de v elopment	was	led	by	Mr	E dwar d	Beale,	a	Dir ect or	of	the	Gr oup	and	Chief	Ex ecutiv e	of	City	Gr oup	Plc.	
Provisions
A provision is recognised in the balance sheet when the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of a past event 
that	can	be	r eliably	measur ed	and	it	is	pr obable	that	an	outflo w	of	ec onomic	benefits	will	be	r equir ed	t o	settle	the	obligation.
Revenue
Revenue represents the amounts derived from the sale of cakes, free from products and speciality, premium and artisan bread 
products within the bakery sector. Revenue is the fair value of consideration received or receivable excluding value added tax, trade 
disc ounts,	tr ansactions	with	or	betw een	subsidiaries	and	deduction	of	off-inv oic e	pric e	pr omotions	and	sales	o v er	rider s.

consideration is probable, the associated costs and probable return of goods can be estimated reliably, there is no continuing 
management involvement with the goods, and the amount of revenue can be reliably measured. In practice this is usually upon 
despatch.
Licence Fees
Payments made for licence fee charges are recognised in the income statement in the period to which they relate. Any charges 
relating to future years are deferred and recognised in the income statement over the life of the contract under cost of sales.
There has been a change in presentation during the current year in relation to the treatment of licence fees. Previously licence fees 
hav e	been	sho wn	as	an	administr ativ e	e xpense.	This	e xpense	has	been	r eclassified	in	the	curr ent	y ear	and	f or	c ompar ativ es	within	
cost of sales. For the current year, cost of sales has increased by £4.5 million 	(2008:	£2.8	million )	with	a	c orr esponding	decr ease	in	
administrative expenses.
Distribution Expenses
There has been a change in presentation during the current year in relation to the treatment of distribution expenses. Previously 
distribution	e xpenses	hav e	been	sho wn	as	a	separ at e	line	in	the	Inc ome	S tat ement.	This	e xpense	has	been	r eclassified	in	the	curr ent	
year and for comparatives as a cost of sale. The impact in the current year on cost of sales is to increase them by £10.6 million 	(2008:	
£10.0 million ).	This	change	has	no	impact	on	the	r epor t ed	r esults.

11 Acquisition of Subsidiaries continued
Whilst the Livwell name may be separable from the Livwell business, the directors determined that the fair value of the Livwell name was most likely to 
be nil. The Livwell name is described as a tertiary brand within the industry. It has served the business as a ‘badge of convenience’, used in two ways:
	 t o 	 allo w 	 the 	 business 	 t o 	 launch 	 new 	 pr oducts 	 in 	 major 	 r etailer s 	 mor e 	 quickly 	 than 	 it 	 w ould 	 be 	 able 	 t o 	 under 	 the 	 cust omer’s 	 o wn 	 label 	 br and 	 –	 •

and packaging costs.
There is no marketing investment in the brand and a third party would not be expected to pay for this ‘badge of convenience’. They would simply 
use an alternative tertiary brand at their disposal or establish one themselves. Similarly, if Finsbury had not acquired the Livwell name with the 
business, it would have used an alternative name at no cost.

c) Anthony Alan Foods Ltd
On 2 October 2007 the Group acquired 100% of the ordinary shares in Anthony Alan Foods Ltd for £2.6 million. £2.3 million of this consideration 
will become due in November 2009 provided that certain conditions are met. This contingent deferred consideration which has been reassessed 
downwards from £3.4 million has been accrued in full. The company is a sales and marketing business which has, under licence, the rights to 
distribut e 	 ambient 	 cak es 	 using 	 the 	 W eightW at cher s 	 br and 	 in 	 the 	 UK 	 and 	 Ir eland. 	 F or 	 the 	 y ear 	 ended 	 30 	 June 	 2008 	 the 	 Company 	 made 	 a 	 pr ofit 	 on

arising from the utilisation of the Group’s existing customer relationships within the cake sector.
The directors considered whether the business rights to use the WeightWatchers brand should be shown as a separate intangible  
asset. The directors deemed it not possible to reliably determine the value to other parties who may be interested in acquiring the  
WeightWatchers licence only, as the value to the Group is intrinsically linked to the breadth of the manufacturing capability of the Group.
The rationale for the acquisition was twofold:
	 Prior	t o	the	ac quisition,	the	Gr oup	had	r eached	the	position	wher e	it	was	manuf acturing	a	significant	pr opor tion	(o v er	70%)	of	the	 •	
t otal	pr oduct	r ange	sold	by	Anthony	Alan	F oods.	This	r eflect ed	the	br oad	pr oduction	capability	of	the	Gr oup	and	ac quiring	the	
business	helped	t o	secur e	the	futur e	pr ofitability	t o	Finsbur y	arising	fr om	the	manuf actur e	of	these	pr oducts.
 Secondly, gaining control of the business has allowed Finsbury to develop and expand the product range far beyond that which •	
the	e xisting	Anthony	Alan	business	was	capable	of	doing,	thus	incr easing	pr ofitability	significantly .	The	dir ect or s	c onsider	the	
ability	t o	r ealise	these	syner gy stic	benefits	t o	be	dependent	on	the	skills	and	driv e	of	the	Finsbur y	t eam	as	w ell	as	the	e xisting	
features of the Anthony Alan business.
The acquisition therefore was inextricably linked to the existing business of Finsbury for the reasons described above. On this basis 
that there has been no recognition of a fair value of a single asset comprising a group of complementary assets, the fair value of the 
Anthony Alan business is deemed to be entirely dependent on the existing production capacity and existing customer relationship  
of the Group. 
The payment of the deferred consideration based on the renewal of the Weight Watchers licence is considered an opportunity for  
the	dir ect or s	t o	assess	whether	the	e xpect ed	benefits	of	the	ac quisition	ar e	being	r ealised	and	not	t o	be	the	v alue	of	the	r enewal	 
of the licence.
The	dir ect or s	ar e	of	the	opinion	that	the	lic enc e	rights	hav e	an	infinit e	lif e.	The	r eason	f or	this	is	that,	whilst	the	t erms	of	the	lic ensing	
agr eement	in	plac e	at	the	time	of	ac quisition	specify	a	limit ed	time	period,	the	dir ect or s	ar e	c onfident	that	they	will	be	r enew ed	
whenever the licence expires. The costs of renewal are negligible and, provided Finsbury continues to provide a consistent royalty 
stream to the licensor and protects the brand values owned by the licensor, the likelihood of ongoing renewal of the licence is very 
high. This is a common feature of the industry.

A discount rate of 10% has been used in these calculations. The Group has considered the impact of the deterioration in the 
economic climate and higher level of return expected by equity holders due to the perceived risk in equity markets. The Group’s actual

The revenue growth rate and indirect cost increase used in Campbells, Memory Lane and Lightbody of Hamilton was nil from the

The expected rate of return takes into consideration the fact that over 90% of the plan assets are held in a target return fund which 
targets RPI + 5%. This expected return rate has not changed between 2008 and 2009 owing to the assumptions that the longer term 
outlook has not changed substantially between these two periods.

The Group does not follow any code 
or statement on payment practice but 
the policy of the Group is to abide by 
such payment terms as are agreed with 
suppliers within the terms of supply. At

c onfidential	inv oicing	f acility ,	loan	not es,	
cash and liquid resources, and various 
items arising directly from its operations, 
such as trade creditors. The main purpose 
of	these	financial	instruments	is	t o	
financ e	the	Gr oup’s	ac quisitions	and	
operations. It is, and has been throughout 
the year under review, the Group’s policy 
that	no	tr ading	in	financial	instruments

The main risks arising from the Group’s 
financial	instruments	ar e	int er est	r at e	risk

agrees policies, which have remained 
substantially unchanged for the year 
under review, for managing these risks. 
The policies are summarised as follows:
Interest Rate Risk 
The	Gr oup	financ es	its	oper ations	by	
r etained	pr ofits	and	bank	borr o wings.	
A suite of borrowing facilities totalling 
£49 million is available. This includes an 
overdraft facility of £2.0 million, undrawn 
invoice discounting facility of £3.5 million 
and	unused	asset	financ e	of	£0.8	million.	
The interest rate risk is managed through 
four interest rate swap transactions, 
of	which	tw o	ar e	fix ed	and	tw o	ar e	
amortising. The total balance of these 
swaps was £19.0 million at the balance 
sheet date. The counterparty to these 
transactions is HSBC Bank Plc.
Liquidity Risk

t eam	briefings,	c onsultativ e	c ommitt ees	
and working parties. 
Disabled Employees
The Group is committed to equality of 
emplo yment	and	its	policies	r eflect	a

the selection and development 
of employees. 
Political and Charitable 
Contributions
During the year charitable donations 
amounting	t o	£29,998	(2008:	£39,441)

pr ojections	and	av ailable	funds	and	
f acilities,	the	dir ect or s	ar e	satisfied	that	
the Group has adequate resources to 
continue in operation for the foreseeable 
future and, therefore, consider it 
appr opriat e	t o	pr epar e	the	financial	
statements on the going concern basis.
Auditors
In accordance with Section 489 of the 
Companies Act 2006, a resolution for 
the	r e-appointment	of	KPMG	Audit	Plc	
as auditors is to be proposed at the 
forthcoming Annual General Meeting.
 As far as the directors are aware, there •	
is no relevant audit information of 
which the company’s auditors are 
unawar e;	and
 They have taken all the steps that •	
they ought to have taken as directors 
in order to make themselves aware of 
any relevant audit information and to 
establish that the company’s auditors 
are aware of that information. 80 Finsbury Food Group Plc Annual Report 2009
Special Business at the 
Annual General Meeting
Shareholders will note from the Notice 
of Meeting on pages 94 to 95 that they 
ar e	ask ed	t o	c onsider	and,	if	thought	fit,	
pass a number of resolutions as special 
business:
1. Under section 80 of the Companies 
Act 1985, the directors are prevented, 
subject	t o	c er tain	e x c eptions,	fr om	
allotting relevant securities without 
the authority of the shareholders 
in the general meeting. Relevant 
securities	ar e	defined	in	the	Act	t o	
include the Company’s ordinary 
shares up to an aggregate nominal 
value of £485,515. The directors’ 
authority will expire at the conclusion 
of the next Annual General Meeting 
or, if earlier, 15 months from the date 
on which the resolution is passed. 
The directors have no immediate 
plans to make use of this authority.
2. Under section 89 of the Companies 
Act 1985, when new shares are 
allotted or sold for cash, they 
must	fir st	be	off er ed	t o	e xisting	
shareholders pro rata to their 
holdings. The proposed special 
resolution renews, for the period to 
the date of the next Annual General 
Meeting or, if earlier, 15 months from 
the date on which this resolution 
is passed, the authority previously 
gr ant ed	t o	the	dir ect or s	t o:	(a)	allot	
shares of the Company in connection 
with	 a	 rights	 issue,	 open	 off er ,	 or	 other	
pr e-emptiv e	off er;	and	(b)	other wise	
allot shares of the Company, up 
to an aggregate nominal value of 
£51,448 representing approximately 
10% of the issued share capital at 
28	Sept ember ,	2009	as	if	the	pr e-
emption rights of section 89 did 
not apply.
3. A resolution is being proposed as 
a Special Resolution which renews 
the directors’ current authority to 
make limited market purchases 
of the Company’s ordinary shares. 
The power is limited to a maximum 
aggregate number of 51,448,466 
(r epr esenting	10%	of	the	issued	shar e	
capital	at	28	Sept ember	2009)	and	
details the minimum and maximum 
prices that can be paid, exclusive of 
expenses. The authority conferred 
by this Resolution will expire at 
the conclusion of the Company’s 
next Annual General Meeting or 
15 months from passing of this 
Resolution, whichever is the earlier. 
Any purchases of ordinary shares 
would be made by means of market 
purchase through the London Stock 
Exchange. Any shares purchased will 
be held in Treasury and may be resold 
at any time.
4. The Board has also taken this 
opportunity to propose that the 
Company adopts a new set of Articles 
of Association. The new Articles 
incorporate changes to company 
legislation under the Companies 
(Shar eholder s’	Rights)	R egulations	
2009 which came into force on 3 
August, 2009, the Companies Act 
2006	 (the	 final	 pr o visions	 of	 which	 will	
c ome	int o	f or c e	on	1	Oct ober ,	2009)	
and the Electronic Communications 
Act 2000.
The directors have proposed the 
adoption of the new Articles in order that 
the Company may take full advantage of 
the new regulations introduced under the 
above legislation. These new regulations 
will	benefit	the	Company	but	will	not	
automatically apply to the Company’s 
Articles of Association unless expressly 
incorporated or if there are contrary 
provisions in the existing Articles. The 
main changes under the new Articles will 
allow the Board to authorise a director’s 
per c eiv ed	or	actual	c onflict	of	int er est;	
enable the Board to take steps to allow 
the Company to communicate with its 
shareholders by means of electronic 
c ommunication	(including	the	ser vic e	of	
notic es	by	e-mail	or	using	the	Company’s	
w ebsit e);	and	will	clarify	the	pr oc edur e	f or	
voting by proxy. The new Articles will also 
provide clarity and avoid any potential 
confusion by removing provisions 
contained within the existing Articles of 
Association which have been revoked 
or superseded by the recent changes 
in company law. Having considered the 
new Articles, the Board unanimously 
recommends that shareholders approve 
the resolution to adopt the new Articles 
in substitution for, and to the exclusion 
of, the Company’s existing Articles of 
Association.

5. Section 270 of the Companies Act 
1985	defines	a	c ompany’s	ac c ounts	
from which distributions are 
det ermined	(the	‘r ele v ant	ac c ounts’)	
as being its last annual accounts, 
except where the distribution 
would be found to contravene the 
limitations on a company’s power 
of distribution, in which case, the 
relevant accounts are the ‘interim 
accounts’. Section 272 of the 
Companies Act 1985 sets out the 
statutory requirements in respect 
of interim accounts prepared for a 
proposed distribution by a public 
company.  
 In December 2007, prior to the 
payment	of	a	£1,029,000	final	
dividend to its shareholders, 
£3,700,000 was distributed to 
 the Company from its operating 
subsidiaries. Interim accounts of the 
Company were prepared at this time, 
but	they	w er e	not	pr epar ed	or	filed	
in accordance with section 272, and 
as a result the dividend payment was 
technically unlawful.
 A resolution is being proposed as 
a	Special	R esolution	which	r atifies	
and approves the dividend paid on 7 
December 2007. The resolution also 
seeks to release the shareholders 
who received such dividend from any 
liability to repay the dividend and to 
release the directors from any claims 
 which the Company may have arising 
from this technical breach of the 
Companies Act 1985.
 Interim accounts which comply 
with the provisions of section 272 
hav e	sinc e	been	pr epar ed	and	filed	
t o	justify	the	final	dividend	made	in	
December 2007. 82 Finsbury Food Group Plc Annual Report 2009
The directors are responsible for 
preparing the annual report and the 
Gr oup	and	par ent	c ompany	financial	
statements in accordance with applicable 
law and regulations.
Company law requires the directors to 
prepare Group and parent company 
financial	stat ements	f or	each	financial	
year. As required by the AIM Rules of the 
London Stock Exchange they are required

in accordance with IFRSs as adopted 
by the EU and applicable law and have 
elected to prepare the parent company 
financial	stat ements	in	ac c or danc e	with	
UK Accounting Standards and applicable 
law	(UK	Gener ally	Ac c ept ed	Ac c ounting	
Pr actic e).
Under company law the directors must 
not	appr o v e	the	financial	stat ements	
unless	they	ar e	satisfied	that	they	giv e	
a	true	and	f air	view	of	the	stat e	of	aff air s	
of the Group and parent company and 
of	their	pr ofit	or	loss	f or	that	period.	In	
preparing each of the Group and parent 
c ompany	financial	stat ements,	the	
directors are required to:
select suitable accounting policies •	
and	then	apply	them	c onsist ently;

pr epar e	the	financial	stat ements	on	 •	
the going concern basis unless it is 
inappropriate to presume that the 
Group and the parent company will 
continue in business.
The directors are responsible for keeping 
adequate accounting records that are

company’s transactions and disclose 
with reasonable accuracy at any time the 
financial	position	of	the	par ent	c ompany

guidance that the Chief Executive should not 
become the Chairman, but considers that 
it is in the best interests of the shareholders 
that Martin Lightbody takes over as Chairman 
following a year as Chief Executive. Martin is 
the largest shareholder in the company, and 
has many years of experience in the baking 
industry.
The role of the Chairman and the Chief

  84 Finsbury Food Group Plc Annual Report 2009
Responsibilities
The Audit Committee has delegated 
responsibility from the Board to monitor 
and review areas such as risk management, 
int ernal 	 c ontr ols 	 and 	 financial 	 r epor ting. 	
The Audit Committee is also responsible for 
maintaining 	 an 	 objectiv e 	 and 	 pr of essional	
relationship with the Group’s auditors, 
monit oring 	 their 	 eff ectiv eness 	 and 	 agr eeing 	
their fees. It receives reports on these issues 
from the relevant executive directors and 
external advisers and reports back to the 
Board on the action points within those 
reports and any recommendations arising. 
As part of these responsibilities it considers 
the requirement for an internal audit 
function.
The terms of reference of the Audit 
Committee can be found on the Company’s 
website www.finsburyfoods.co.uk
Membership
The Audit Committee is chaired by me, 
Ian 	 F arnsw or th. 	 E dwar d 	 Beale, 	 a 	 Non-
Executive Director, is the other member. 
Both are considered to be independent 
directors. Edward Beale is a member of the 
Accounting Standards Board of the Financial 
Reporting Council and is able to provide 
technical input to committee discussions.
Procedures
The 	 Audit 	 Committ ee 	 has 	 met 	 fiv e 	 times 	
in the year. The Group Finance Director is 
invited to attend committee meetings and 
the external auditors are invited to attend 
any 	 meetings 	 inv olving 	 financial 	 stat ements. 	
Time is set aside during at least one 
meeting each year for the Committee to 
hold discussions in private with the external 
auditors in the absence of management and 
executive directors. The Company Secretary 
attends committee meetings and prepares 
and circulates minutes of the meetings.
Risks and Controls
Group management prepares an annual 
report for the Audit Committee, identifying 
the risks to which the Group is exposed, the 
procedures in place to mitigate the risks 
and the potential impact on the Group. The 
Audit Committee reviews this report and 
any concerns that it has over the adequacy 
of the controls in place, or the level of risk 
accepted by the Group, are reported to the 
Board. The principal operating risks to which 
the Group is exposed are set out in the 
Business Review on page 8. 
The Committee reviews the need for an 
internal audit function on an annual basis. 
At present, due to the limited size of the 
Group and lack of complexity in the business 
model, the Committee does not believe 
that a dedicated internal audit function is 
warranted. 
External Reporting
The Board delegates primary responsibility 
for the preparation of complete, balanced 
and 	 ac cur at e 	 financial 	 stat ements 	 and 	
disclosures, in accordance with Financial 
Reporting Standards and regulations, 
to the Group Finance Director. The 
responsibility of the Audit Committee is to 
c onsider 	 significant 	 ac c ounting 	 policies, 	
any 	 changes 	 in 	 policies 	 and 	 significant 	
estimat es 	 and 	 judgements, 	 taking 	 int o	
account the external auditors’ view, and 
to report back to the Board any concerns 
that it might have. The Audit Committee 
reviews and comments on the clarity and 
completeness of disclosures within the 
financial 	 stat ements. 	 Ultimat e 	 r esponsibility 	
for reviewing and approving the annual 
report and accounts and half yearly reports 
remains with the Board.
The Audit Committee also reviews 
and comments on related information 
pr esent ed 	 with 	 the 	 financial 	 stat ements, 	
in particular the Business Review and the 
Report on Corporate Governance.
The Audit Committee considered the 
presentation of results in the Income 
S tat ement 	 and 	 has 	 r ealigned 	 it 	 (via 	 the	
r e-classification 	 of 	 c er tain 	 it ems 	 of 	 e xpense) 	
to bring it into line with the revised basis of 
management reporting.
Other Matters
Certain tax advice has been received from 
the auditors and this was approved in 
advance. It is of limited nature and we do 
not believe it compromises the auditors’ 
independence.
During the year the Committee discussed 
taxation policy, accounting resources and 
matters concerning the acquisition of 
Goswell Enterprises Ltd.
If any readers of these accounts have 
any suggestions for improvement in the 
c ont ent 	 or 	 the 	 pr esentation 	 of 	 the 	 financial 	
statements, please can they let me know by 
writing to info@ finsbur yf oods. c o .uk.

dir ect or s 	 f or 	 the 	 financial 	 y ear 	 ended 	 4 	 July 	
2009 	 as 	 pr ofitability 	 tar gets 	 w er e 	 not 	 met.
Pension contributions for executive directors 
are set at up to 8% of basic annual salary 
excluding additional amounts arising from 
bonuses 	 or 	 salar y 	 sacrific e.
No director has a service contract 
incorporating a notice period of more than 
12 months.
Chairman and Other 
Non-Executive Directors
Corporate governance best practice is 
that 	 non-e x ecutiv e 	 dir ect or s 	 should 	 not	
be rewarded with share options and so 
the Group’s share related incentive plans 
are restricted to executive directors and 
senior 	 manager s 	 of 	 the 	 Gr oup . 	 Non-
executive directors receive a basic fee plus 
additional amounts relating to time spent 
on committee meetings and in providing 
advice and support to executive directors 
and senior group management. The 
remuneration of the Chairman is determined 
by the Board and the remuneration of 
non-e x ecutiv e 	 dir ect or s 	 is 	 det ermined 	 by 	 the	
Chairman and the Group Chief Executive.
Annual Cash Bonus Schemes
The Remuneration Committee reviews and 
approves proposed annual cash bonus 
schemes within the Group. The main 
characteristics of these schemes are that 
payments to individuals depend on the 
pr ofitability 	 of 	 the 	 business 	 unit 	 r elativ e 	 t o 	
its budget and the achievement of relevant 
personal or departmental performance 
conditions. Maximum payments under 
these schemes are set at levels that are 
meaningful, but not excessive, relative to 
individuals’ salaries.

Long Term Incentive Scheme
No options under the Long Term Incentive 
Scheme have been issued during the year. 
The terms of the scheme are currently
under review. 
Senior Group Management
In April 2009, and as advised in last year’s 
report, the Group cancelled the share 
options granted to 31 senior managers 
in October 2007 and replaced them with 
new options at an exercise price of 14.0p, 
t h e 	 m i d - m a r k e t 	 p r i c e 	 a t 	 t h e 	 g r a n t 	 d a t e . 	 T h e	
cancellation resulted in a notional charge of 
£102,000 in the results for the year ending 
30 	 June 	 2009. 	 The 	 r eplac ement 	 shar e	
options gave rise to a charge of £1,000 in 
the year.
Group SA YE Scheme
The Group SA YE ShareSave Scheme was 
intr oduc ed 	 in 	 Januar y 	 2008, 	 and 	 a 	 sec ond	
tranche of options was granted following 
an invitation to qualifying employees in 
October 2008. Demand for the options 
was higher than could be met and grants 
were scaled back to 40% of the application. 
477,600 options were granted under this 
Scheme to 125 employees with an exercise 
price of 32.0p per share, giving rise to a 
charge in the year of £10,000 and an annual 
charge of £17,000 to October 2011. Annual 
awards under this Scheme are limited to 
approximately 1% of the shares in issue and 
invitations to enter the Scheme are issued in 
October each year.

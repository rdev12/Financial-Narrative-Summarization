Who We Are
2 patsystems plc i annual report & accounts 2008
oUr FoUnDation 
patsystems was founded in 1994 
by a team of derivatives traders 
and it experts who recognised 
that the derivatives industry 
was moving towards electronic 
trading and built systems that 
would lead the way as traders 
migrated away from open  
outcry trading.
since then, patsystems has 
continued to innovate and 
lead the market in electronic 
trading of derivatives by 
developing a range of scalable 
and versatile trading modules, 
risk management systems and 
exchange systems. 
proDUCt History 
patsystems’ first trading 
front-end, J-trader, is now 
a well recognised name in 
the derivatives industry with 
extensive global distribution.  
to complement J-trader,  
pro-mark and iQ-trader have 
been launched in recent years 
to provide an advanced and 
feature-rich suite of trading 
tools. a longside these well-
established front-ends, patsystems 
offers both proprietary and FiX 
apis which are currently used  
by thousands of developers. 
o ur trading solutions are 
complemented by our 
extensive network of exchange 
connectivity. patsystems offers 
direct market access to over 
50 exchanges along with 
indirect access through our 
unique Xlink network. Xlink 
allows patsystems’ customers to 
leverage one another’s exchange 
memberships. in 2008 patsystems 
launched an extension to 
our capability to support the 
broadest possible range of 
products and trading styles with 
an extension to our existing 
synthetic o rder management 
system (syoms ). t his extension 
is called algoserver and enables 
customers to develop customised 
algorithms and trade non-
exchange supported order types. 
in addition to trading platforms, 
patsystems offers an exchange 
solution that includes matching, 
clearing and settlement. t he 
exchange system is built around 
the patsystems matching Engine 
(pmE). t he pmE was acquired 
from Exchange network systems 
in 2000 and supports a number of 
exchanges across asia including 
the tokyo grain Exchange, Kansai 
Commodities Exchange, the 
agricultural Futures Exchange 
of thailand and the national 
Commodity Exchange l imited  
in pakistan.
in august of 2005, patsystems 
acquired the entire issued share 
capital of tamesis l imited. 
t he acquisition extended our 
trading and exchange offerings 
to include risk solutions with 
the r isk informer product. r isk 
informer enables the real-time 
quantitative analysis of risk 
across multiple asset classes.  
in 2008, patsystems developed  
a multi-asset class, pre-trade  
risk offering, risk monitor.
CorporatE History 
t he company floated on  
the london stock Exchange 
in march 2000 and transferred 
to the alternative investment 
market (aim) in February

I am delighted to report a 
strong set of results for the 2008 
financial year which have been 
achieved against a backdrop of 
significant change in our markets 
and the overall economic turmoil. 
I believe this demonstrates the 
fundamental strength of both 
our business and business model.
At the half year results,  
I commented that sales wins 
expected in the first half of  
the year had crystallised later 
than expected. I am pleased  
to confirm that the confidence 
I expressed in our sales pipeline 
was well founded and that 
market expectations have  
been fully achieved.
t he recurring nature of a 
substantial proportion of 
our trading systems revenue 
combined with continued growth 
in demand for our post-trade 
risk product, Risk Informer, has 
delivered both revenue growth 
and a robust cash position for 
the business. we have continued 
to add new customers as well 
as developing further our 
relationships with existing clients.
Cash flows from operating activities 
amounted to £3.6 million compared 
to £2.6 million in 2007; we expect  
this level of cash generation to 
continue in the forthcoming 
year. the year end cash balance 
stood at £5.9 million (2007:  
£3.2 million) and the business 
remains debt free.

of a recurrent nature compared

DIvIDEnD
Following the dividend of 
0.21p per share, approved by 
shareholders at the Annual 
general meeting on 17 April 
2008, relating to the results 
for 2007, the Board declared 
an interim dividend of 0.126p, 
payable in september 2008, 
based on the interim results 
for the year.
Patsystems is expected to 
continue to generate resilient 
positive operating cash flow in 
2009 and beyond, in light of 
this, and combined with our 
strong year end cash position, 
the Board is recommending the 
payment of a final dividend of 
0.237p based on the results for 
2008 as a whole, bringing the 
total dividend for the year to 
0.363p per share, compared to 
a total of 0.33p for 2007. this 
gives a year on year growth 
of 10% in our dividend.

Considerable success for the 
Risk Informer product with 
new sales at gH Financials  
and Royal Bank of Canada 
Capital markets. 14 Patsystems plc I Annual Report & Accounts 2008
Revenue has risen 15% to  
£19.6 million compared to  
£17.0 million in 2007 with 
improved contributions from  
all three product segments.
Earlier in the year it was necessary 
to advise shareholders that the 
business had experienced a delay 
in the closure of new business 
opportunities and the result for 
the first half of the financial year 
would be impacted by those 
delays. I am delighted to report 
that, as was forecast at the time 
of the announcement, those 
delayed sales have been 
concluded during the second 
half of the year.
the conclusion of those sales 
opportunities has meant that the 
second half performance of the 
business was substantially ahead 
of the first half. t he adjusted 
profit for the second half of the 
year was £3.3 million compared 
to £0.4 million in the first half.
operating expenses were 18.6% 
higher at £17.2 million when 
compared to £14.5 million in 2007.
t here are three significant 
components to this increase in 
costs; £2 million due to planned 
increased staff costs compared 
to 2007, £0.35 million due to 
the increase in amortisation of

I am delighted to report a further 
and ongoing increase in the 
number of users for the Pro-mark 
professional trading tool. At the 
end of the financial year there 
were 571 billable users compared 
to 375 at the start of the year. 
Adoption of the Pro-mark 
tool at mF global, morgan 
stanley and newedge has been 
particularly strong during the 
year. two of our major customers 
have forward purchased their 
2009 trading screen requirement 
which is a clear demonstration of 
their commitment to both their 
businesses and Patsystems; this 
revenue will be recognised  
during 2009.
As a recognition of the 
significant product investment 
we have made in the Pro-mark 
product in 2008, it was awarded 
the “technology Product of the 
year” by Futures and o ptions 
w eek magazine.
Pro-mark 5.0 was released 
in July 2008 and this release 
contained a host of new 
functionality as well as an 
improved log-on capability 
improving download speeds  
for the start of the day’s  
trading by over 60%.
o ther functional improvements 
included an enhanced microsoft 
Excel plug-in capability to enable 
a broader population to use 
the functionality and Pro-mark 
Control, which enables an 
appropriately mandated super 
user or administrator to monitor 
or intervene on any order or 
trade account.
t he existing core system was 
improved by the release of 
version 4.0 for the software in 
september 2008; the release 
included a substantial extension 
to the data capacity of the 
order routing capability and 
further improvements to 
the transaction handling to 
ensure the product’s operating 
performance remains ahead of 
our customers’ requirements.
xlink is Patsystems’ 
proprietary network that 
enables Patsystems users 
to leverage both exchange 
memberships and operations 
within territories where they 
are not present, by way of 
utilising the installations and 
exchange memberships of other 
customers. xl ink adoption 
continued to grow in 2008.
Deployment of global trading, 
our new core offering, was 
delayed during the year due 
to integration issues and, as 
was reported at the half year, 
is not expected to contribute 
to revenue materially until the 
second half of 2009.
t he latest version of global 
trading, version 1.1, is functionally 
equivalent to the current core of 
the existing system and is fully 
compatible with the current 
trading screen versions of J-trader 
and Pro-mark, as well as all of our 
existing exchange connectivity.

Revenue from our risk systems 
business grew by 21% to £1.7 
million from £1.4 million in 2007 
and £0.7 million in 2006. 
During the year there was 
considerable success for the Risk 
Informer product with new sales 
of the product to gH Financials 
and Royal Bank of Canada 
Capital markets to support the 
management of their post-
trade risk on exchange traded 
derivatives business.
there were further sales of 
extension licences to newedge 
and mF global during the year to 
support their additional business 
use of Risk Informer and a 
significant Risk Informer sale to a 
major investment bank to manage 
the trading of their clients for 
exchange traded derivatives.
It is firmly our belief that Risk 
Informer is the market leading 
product for the management 
and control of post-trade risk for 
exchange traded derivatives and its 
proven capability to risk other asset 
classes’ means that we continue to 
have great optimism for the growth 
in opportunities from this product.
I am pleased to announce 
that we have just concluded a 
successful beta of our new pre-
trade product, Risk monitor. 
As I stated last year, Risk monitor 
is a low latency pre-trade risk 
management tool designed to 
monitor trades ahead of them 
being traded on an exchange. t his 
provides the customer with the 
opportunity to be alerted or even 
to intervene before a trade occurs. 
w e have had considerable 
interest within our customer 
base for this type of capability 
and we expect Risk monitor to 
commence generating licence 
revenue in 2009.

Revenue from the exchange

for the year compared to 
£1.3 million in 2007, and was 
primarily from the provision

In contrast to previous years 
there have been a number of

none of these opportunities have 
materialised in sales.

the availability of the matching 
engine capability within our product 
portfolio continues to open up sales 
opportunities for the rest of our 
product range, with the Chinese 
Futures Exchange trading system 
and the Hong Kong mercantile 
Exchange being prime examples 
of this. these opportunities may 
not have been available without 
the dialogue about the matching 
and clearing product set as a first 
basis for engagement.
though we remain optimistic about 
the opportunity to successfully sell 
our exchange solution we have 
not factored any contribution from 
matching engine sales within our 
business plan for 2009.

w e continuously challenge  
and scrutinise the value that 
we get from our marketing 
expenditure and, in 2008, we 
invested £0.2 million. I am 
very satisfied as to how well 
established the key brand 
message we introduced in 2008 
has become. “powers trades. 
builds exchanges. manages 
risk.” neatly epitomises our 
core proposition and has been 
consistently reinforced in our 
marketing activities in 2008.
In 2008, we decided to withdraw 
from a number of trade shows 
that we felt had not delivered 
value, by way of foot fall, 
senior prospect or customer 
engagement, and have invested 
more extensively in the shows 
that we believe enable us to 
communicate our message  
most effectively.
In late 2008, we tested the use 
of an on-line marketing 
approach rather than the 
mixture of trade press adverts 
and advertorial we have used 
in the past. t his was highly 
successful and delivered 
a measurable return on 
investment. For 2009, we have 
appointed a us agency to 
support our Head of marketing 
based in Chicago in extending 
the on-line marketing strategy.

within 2008, we launched an 
extension to our capability to 
support the broadest possible 
range of products and trading 
styles with an extension module 
to our existing syoms system.
syoms is a Patsystems tool 
that enables traders to execute 
products that do not exist on an 
exchange, such as a stop, time 
triggered or limit orders, by 
simulating their existence.
the new extension module to 
syoms is called Algoserver and 
enables syoms to support a range 
of algorithms. t he first release has 
a selection of algorithms provided 
by Patsystems but subsequent 
versions will enable users to 
introduce their own algorithms  
by way of our proprietary API.
In 2009, our focus will be 
to conclude the first live 
deployments of both global 
trading and Risk monitor and 
to commence the first beta 
deployment of Algoserver to one 
of our existing syoms customers.
t he other significant investment 
that we will be making in 
2009 is the establishment of a 
technical framework to reduce 
the ongoing development 
and support costs of exchange 
connectivity for the future. 
we have recruited a new product 
head for the connectivity team 
and removed the fragmentation 
that existed with our connectivity 
team members being based in 
both london and Chicago.
the instigation of new processes 
and the change in individuals 
within the team will mean 
there will be a lower level 
of productivity within the 
connectivity team in the first half 
of 2009, but we expect to see the 
return on improved productivity 
and shorter development lead  
times in future periods.

As both Richard and David have 
already reported, this has been 
a very successful year both in 
terms of the level of adjusted 
profit and more importantly in 
the current economic climate the 
amount of cash generated.
Adjusted profit increased 23% 
to £3.7 million from £3.0 million 
in 2007 and operating cash 
flow also improved by 38% to 
£3.6 million from £2.6 million in 
the prior year. As a result of the 
net cash increase of £2.7 million 
the group ended the year with 
a cash balance of £5.9 million. 
Adjusted profit is a measure 
used by the analysts that 
cover the group including the 
analyst from our House Broker, 
seymour Pierce. Adjusted profit 
removes volatile non-cash items 
to show an underlying level of 
profitability that enables the 
results for the business to be 
compared on a consistent basis 
for each accounting period. 
the adjustments made to the 
reported pre-tax profit on 
ordinary activities are to add 
back the charge or credit for; 
(i) share option costs; (ii) the 
marking-to-market of derivatives 
that are used to hedge overseas 
foreign currency cash flows; and 
(iii) amortisation of intangibles 
other than those charges for 
internally developed software. 
t he table in the Earnings 
per share section details the 
adjustments made to operating 
profit in both this current and 
the prior year.
During 2008, the group has seen 
sterling fall to levels against 
both the us Dollar and the 
Japanese yen that have not 
been experienced previously by 
Patsystems. the average rates 
used to translate the Dollar and 
yen currencies in our profit and 
loss account in 2008 were 1.84 and 
190.76 respectively against rates 
of 2.01 and 235.50 in 2007. t he 
weakness of sterling is even starker 
when the rates used to translate 
our year end balance sheet are 
compared. the 2008 year end rates 
for the Dollar and yen were 1.44 
and 130.86 compared to 2.00 and 
224.00 in 2007.
the group revenues for 2008 
have benefited by approximately 
£1 million as a result of the 
exchange rate movements. 
Conversely operating costs that 
are denominated in Dollars and 
yen, namely salaries and property 
costs have also increased. this 
exchange rate movement has 
resulted in an additional cost of 
approximately £400k and hence 
“Cash and cash 
equivalents increased 
to £5.9m from £3.2m 
last year.”

o perating expenses increased 
by £2.7 million to £17.2 million 
from £14.5 million in 2007. 
Approximately £0.4 million 
of this increase was due to 
the weakening of sterling 
against the Dollar and yen.
t he majority of the increase 
in overheads is attributable 
to staff costs which increased 
by £2.0 million as a result of a 
combination of salary increases 
in January 2008, new recruits, 
less time being capitalised into 
development projects and an 
increased level of contracted 
resource during the first half  
of 2008. the number of 
contractors peaked at 15 in 
February 2008 and was reduced 
to 3 by the end of 2008. t his 
number is expected to remain 
the same during 2009.
At 31 December 2008 the group 
had 156 permanent staff (2007: 
150) and 3 contractors (2007: 12).
In addition to the increase in staff 
costs, amortisation of capitalised 
development costs increased by 
£0.44 million to £0.62 million 
and the mark-to-market charge 
for future years dollar forward 
contracts purchased to hedge 
future cash flows increased to 
£0.88 million from £0.10 million

trade payables have fallen 
slightly to £0.29 million from 
£0.32 million in 2007. other tax 
and social security has increased by 
£0.37 million as a result of vAt and 
sales tax due on the higher level 
of sales made in the final quarter 
of 2008. Accruals have grown to 
£1.6 million from £1.1 million in 
the previous year mainly as a result 
of an increase in sales commission 
pertaining to the final quarter sales. 
Deferred Income has increased 
by £0.89 million as a result of the 
growth in the level of block licenses 
purchased by clients. the revenue 
from these block licences will be 
released to the income statement 
on a monthly basis during 2009.
BusInEss RIsKs
t he principal business risks remain 
the same as in previous years, 
however in the current economic 
climate the group has added a 
further business risk which in previous 
years the group did not consider 
significant; namely bad debts.
Competition
t he group operates in a growing 
but competitive market. there are 
three major software suppliers 
in the global electronic trading 
systems market for futures and 
options, of which Patsystems is one. 
there are many smaller companies 
who supply screens but not market 
connectivity. In such a market there 
is always a risk that customers could 
move to other competitors and 
there is always downward pressure 
on margins. Patsystems mitigates 
this risk by supporting its brands 
with appropriate marketing activity 
and by consistently extending its 
market connectivity as well as 
improving its software, customer 
support and customer care.
Bad debts
As has been seen by the demise 
of many well known financial 
institutions over the last 9 months, 
the deterioration in the global 
economic climate has been 
particularly painful in the financial 
services sector. As the majority of 
our clients are financial services 
organisations the group considers 
that the potential for a client to 
get into financial difficulties and 
not to be able to pay its debts has 
increased. In order to mitigate this 
risk Patsystems reviews all client 
accounts on a monthly basis and 
takes appropriate action to keep 
accounts within payment terms.
During the year, l ehman Brothers, 
a client for many years, entered 
into Chapter 11 in the us and was 
subsequently sold. All debts due 
from lehman were recovered in full.
Customer consolidation
Consolidation within the financial 
services industry has occurred 
over the past few years and 
further consolidation remains 
a risk. where consolidation 
takes place the risk to the 
group’s business is typically to 
the revenues associated with 
market connectivity and support 
and maintenance. we mitigate 
this risk by actively adding new 
customers, products and asset 
categories to our portfolio. 
Revenue profile
87% of Patsystems revenue is 
recurring in nature and, in stark 
contrast to many technology 
companies, this gives a level 
of guarantee for a minimum 
level of operating profit for the 
business on an annual basis.
However, with products such as 
Risk Informer playing an integral 
role in the group’s future growth 
expectations and the significant 
revenues from these opportunities 
being non-recurring in nature, the 
propensity for organisations such 
as the investment banks to defer

Details of the Directors who have an interest in share options are disclosed in the Remuneration report.
Save as disclosed in this report and note 28, there were no other contracts subsisting during or at the end of the 
financial year in which a Director of the Company is or was materially interested.
EMPLOYEE INVOLVEMENT
The Directors recognise the importance of employee involvement established by good communications and working 
relationships. The decentralised nature of the Group’s activities necessitates that the practical application of this 
policy is the responsibility of local management in a manner appropriate to their circumstances.
EMPLOYMENT POLICIES
The Group is committed to the terms of the Codes of Practice for the elimination of all or any discrimination and to 
the promotion of equality of opportunities in employment. 
It is Group policy to afford equal opportunities to all employees and job applicants. No employee or job applicant 
is less favourably treated than another on the grounds of their sex, sexual orientation, age, marital status, religion, 
race, nationality, ethnic or national origin, colour or disability and all appointments and promotions are determined 
solely by merit.
It is also Group policy to encourage and assist in the employment, training, re-training and career development  
of disabled persons where possible, having regard to their suitability for a particular vacancy and the nature of  
the Group’s activities. In the event that employees become disabled during employment the Group will where 
possible continue their employment and arrange appropriate training.
Responsibility for monitoring the effective working of these policies is vested in Martin Thorneycroft,  
the Finance Director.
FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AND FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT
The Group’s activities expose it to a variety of financial risks and it has developed and operates an overall risk 
management programme that recognises the unpredictability of financial markets and seeks to minimise potential 
adverse effects on the Group’s financial performance. 
Financial risk management is under the control of the Finance Director and is carried out centrally for the Group  
in compliance with policies approved and monitored by the full Board. The Board regularly reviews the effectiveness 
of these policies examining specific areas including foreign exchange risk, interest rate risk, credit risk and the 
extent to which financial instruments are being used to hedge certain risk exposures. 
Details of the Group’s exposures to market, credit and liquidity risks are set out in note 3 to the financial statements.
RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT
During the year the Company continued to invest in research and development (R&D). All expenditure, whether incurred 
through internal staff costs or through third party suppliers, relating to R&D that satisfies the criteria for capitalisation 
under IAS 38, ‘Intangible assets’, is capitalised. Otherwise it is written off to the income statement in the period incurred.
CREDITOR PAYMENT POLICY
Given the international nature of the Group’s operations, there is no standard code for the Group in respect 
of payments to suppliers. Operating subsidiaries are responsible for agreeing terms and conditions for their 
business transactions when orders for goods and services are placed, ensuring that suppliers are aware of the 
terms of payment and including the relevant terms in contracts where appropriate. These arrangements are 
adhered to provided that suppliers meet their contractual commitments. 30 Patsystems plc I Annual Report & Accounts 2008
Creditor days have not been calculated for the Company as it is an investment holding company.
CHARITABLE AND POLITICAL DONATIONS
The Group made charitable contributions of £500 during the year (2007: £500). The donations were  
made to Macmillan Cancer Support. No political donations were made in 2008 or 2007.
DISCLOSURE OF INFORMATION TO AUDITORS
For each of the persons who were Directors at the time this report was prepared, the following applies:
So far as the Directors are aware, there is no relevant information of which the Company’s auditors are unaware; and 
The Directors have taken all the steps that they ought to have taken as Directors in order to make themselves aware  
of any relevant audit information and to establish that the Company’s auditors are aware of that information.
DISCLOSURE AND TRANSPARENCY RULES (DTR)
The Company has complied with the DTR so far as they are applicable to AIM listed companies.
ANNUAL GENERAL MEETING
The Notice convening the Annual General Meeting (AGM) together with the proposed resolutions is being sent 
to shareholders. The AGM will be held on 28 April 2009.
STATEMENT OF DIRECTORS’ RESPONSIBILITIES
Company law requires the Directors to prepare financial statements for each financial year, which give a true  
and fair view of the state of affairs of the Company and the Group, as at the end of the year, and of the profit  
or loss of the Group for the year. In preparing those financial statements, the Directors are required to:
Select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently; 1. 
Make judgements and estimates that are reasonable and prudent; 2. 
State whether applicable accounting standards have been followed, subject to any material departures disclosed 3. 
and explained in the financial statements;
Prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis unless it is inappropriate to presume that the Group 4. 
will continue in business.
The Directors confirm that the financial statements comply with the above requirements.
The Directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity of the Patsystems website. Information published 
on the Internet is accessible in many countries with different legal requirements. Legislation in the United Kingdom 
governing the preparation and dissemination of financial statements may differ from legislation in other jurisdictions.
The Directors are responsible for maintaining proper accounting records which disclose with reasonable accuracy  
at any time the financial position of the Company and the Group and enable them to ensure that the financial 
statements comply with the Companies Act 1985 (as amended from time to time). The Directors are also responsible 
for safeguarding the assets of the Company and the Group and hence for taking reasonable steps for the 
prevention and detection of fraud and other irregularities.

Directors’ Report HIGHLIGHTS THE COMPANY THE YEAR IN REVIEW GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
31 Patsystems plc I Annual Report & Accounts 2008
The following statement of corporate governance reflects the position of the Group as at 31 December 2008.
The Board is responsible for the Group’s corporate governance policy and recognises the importance of high 
standards of integrity, and consistently seeks to apply the principles set out in the Combined Code on Corporate 
Governance (the “Code”) to the extent that they are appropriate for, and applicable to, a company of Patsystems’ 
size quoted on the Alternative Investment Market (“AIM”).
DIRECTORS
Details of the dates of appointment and resignation of Directors within the year are shown in the Directors’ Report. 
All Directors are subject to re-election within a three-year period. The roles of the Chairman and Chief Executive are 
separate and have been so throughout the year.
The Non-executive Directors are considered to be ‘independent’ within the definition contained in the Code. The Non-
executive Directors meet, without the presence of the Executive Directors, whenever it is appropriate for them to do so.
All the Directors have access to the advice of the Company Secretary and may, in furtherance of their duties, take 
independent legal and financial advice at the Company’s expense. They also have access to the minutes of the 
Board, in which any concerns expressed by them regarding matters pertaining to the Group are recorded.
While there is no formal process, the performance and effectiveness of each Director, including the Non-executive 
Directors, is assessed on an on-going basis by the other members of the Board.
BOARD MEETINGS
The Board generally meets monthly and at such other times as required, and receives regular reports on a wide 
range of key issues including operational performance, risk management and corporate strategy.
The Board’s accountability is demonstrated by the adoption of a formal schedule of matters specifically reserved 
to the Board for its decision concerning all key areas across the Group’s activities, thereby ensuring that all major 
decisions affecting the Group are taken at Board level. All the Directors are free to bring any matter to the 
attention of the Board, at any time.
COMMITTEES
The Audit Committee and the combined Remuneration and Nominations Committee meet at least twice a year.
Audit Committee
The Audit Committee is chaired by John Priestley and comprises all the Non-executive Directors. Prior to 
17 April 2008 the Audit Committee was chaired by Richard Last. The external auditors, together with the  
Finance Director and other financial staff are invited to attend these meetings as and when required.
In accordance with its terms of reference the principal function of this committee is to determine the 
appropriateness of accounting policies to be used in the Group’s annual results. In addition the Committee  
is responsible for monitoring the independence of the Group auditors, assessing the Group’s audit arrangements 
and the Group’s system of internal controls, and reviewing the half-yearly and annual results before publication.
Remuneration and Nominations Committee
The Remuneration and Nominations Committee comprises all the Non-executive Directors and is chaired by  
Steve Sparke. Prior to 17 April 2008 the Committee was chaired by John Priestley.
In accordance with its terms of reference the Committee determines the level and make-up of remuneration 
(including bonuses and options) of the Executive Directors and certain senior management. This also includes 
formulation of remuneration policy throughout the Group, embracing both share options and bonuses.
The Committee also evaluates the balance of skills, knowledge and experience on the Board and considers all  
new Board appointments and re-appointments against this evaluation.
The Report of the Board on Directors’ Remuneration and on Group Remuneration Policy giving details of Company 
policy and individual Directors’ remuneration is set out on pages 33 to 36. The remuneration arrangements of the 
Non-executive Directors are determined by the Board as a whole.
The notice period provisions contained in the Directors’ service agreements are summarised on page 35 of these accounts.
Statement of Corporate Governance 32 Patsystems plc I Annual Report & Accounts 2008
Executive Management Committee
The Executive Management Committee (the “EMC”), under the Chairmanship of the Chief Executive, or in his 
absence the Finance Director, meets monthly and is responsible for the day-to-day running of the Group. The 
members of the EMC are the two Executive Directors of the Company, together with the five key business heads 
who are not Directors.
RELATIONS WITH SHAREHOLDERS
The Board welcomes the views of shareholders.
The Annual General Meeting (AGM) is used as an opportunity to communicate with shareholders. All shareholders are 
encouraged to attend the Company’s AGM, in order to take advantage of the opportunity to ask questions of the Directors.
Shareholders may also contact the Company in writing or via its website, which is regularly updated. Additional 
information is supplied through the circulation of the Interim Report and the Annual Report and Accounts. During 
the year the Company issued a series of announcements to the Stock Exchange. The Chief Executive, Finance 
Director and the Chairman from time to time meet individual and institutional shareholders and provide such 
information as is permissible in order to facilitate a better understanding of the Group’s business and operations.
INTERNAL CONTROL
The Board of Directors has overall responsibility both for the Group’s system of internal controls, which includes 
internal financial controls and for reviewing their effectiveness. The Directors recognise that no system of internal 
control can provide absolute assurance. The Group’s systems are designed to manage the risk of failure to achieve 
business objectives and therefore can only provide the Directors with reasonable assurance against material 
misstatement or loss.
The key elements of the Group’s internal control system, which have been operational for the whole of the financial 
year, are as follows:
Management structure 
The Board has overall responsibility for the Group and there is a formal schedule of matters specifically reserved for 
decision by the Board. Each executive Director has been given responsibility for specific aspects of the Group’s affairs. 
Reporting to the Chief Executive, is the EMC which is responsible for the day to day running of the Group’s affairs.
 Monitoring systems used by the Board 
The Board receives regular reports on the financial and business performance of the Group. The Board is 
regularly advised through these reports on the working capital position and financial performance relative to the 
Group’s approved budget.
Internal Audit 
The Board reviews from time to time the need for an Internal Audit function and remains of the opinion that the systems 
of internal financial control are appropriate to the Group’s present activities and that such a function is unnecessary.
GOING CONCERN
The Directors have reasonable expectation that the Company and the Group have adequate resources to continue  
in operational existence for the foreseeable future. For this reason they continue to adopt the going concern basis 
in preparing the financial statements.
COMPLIANCE STATEMENT
Corporate Governance procedures are subject to regular review by the Board. Throughout the year the Directors 
believe that the Group has complied with the provisions as set out in Section 1 of the Code, to the extent that  
they are appropriate for, and applicable to, a company of Patsystems’ size quoted on AIM.
For and on behalf of the Board of Patsystems plc.

Statement of Corporate Governance HIGHLIGHTS THE COMPANY THE YEAR IN REVIEW GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

REMUNERATION COMMITTEE
The Remuneration Committee, which comprises all of, and only, Non-executive Directors, determines Group 
remuneration policy and the remuneration (including bonuses and options) of Executive Directors and certain 
other senior management.
POLICY ON GROUP REMUNERATION
The Company’s policy is to set the remuneration of senior executives (including Executive Directors) at a level to 
attract and retain executives of appropriate ability and experience to manage the affairs of the Company. This 
approach contains costs, improves employee benefits and increases the Company’s competitiveness in the market 
for scarce skills. In formulating its remuneration policy, the Remuneration Committee is mindful of the competitive 
pressures inherent in a sector that straddles both the software and financial services industries. It is the Company’s 
policy that a significant element of total remuneration is related to the financial performance of the Company. 
Remuneration is reviewed annually.
THE REMUNERATION PACKAGE
The remuneration package comprises base salary and benefits, pension contributions, annual bonus and long-term 
incentive arrangements. All senior employees of the Group (including the Executive Directors) are remunerated 
using the policy described below.
Base salary and benefits
Base salary takes into account the performance of the individual and information from independent sources on 
market levels of remuneration. The Executive Directors basic salaries are reviewed by the Committee prior to the 
beginning of each year. The Executive Directors are also entitled to private medical, death in service, critical illness, 
permanent health insurance and subsidised health club membership.
Pension contributions
The Group operates a defined contribution pension scheme for eligible UK employees. Neither of the Executive 
Directors are members of this scheme; the Executive Directors receive a company contribution to their individual 
pension arrangements.
Annual bonuses
Bonus scheme arrangements are in place for all members of staff, including the Executive Directors. Bonuses for the 
Executive Directors are linked to the performance of the Group and staff bonuses are based on individual performance.
Long-term incentives
Share options
The Group operates two share option plans – an Enterprise Management Incentive Share Option Scheme (EMI) and a 
standard unapproved share option scheme. All senior staff, including the Executive Directors participate in both schemes.
Options awarded under the first of three main grants vested in full in 2006. An aggregate total of 20% of the options 
awarded under the second and third grants of both schemes vested on 14 February 2007 and 16% vested on 11 February 2008. 
Unless these options have been subject to separate vesting criteria agreed by the Remuneration Committee during the 
year, a further 40% will vest on 9 February 2009. The remaining 24% of the options will be carried forward into 
future years and the Remuneration Committee will determine what performance conditions to attach to them in 2009.
The Company has also made a number of special awards under both schemes to Directors and senior employees 
which will vest in between one and three years from the date of grant subject to certain performance conditions. 
The Board is currently reviewing the ongoing effectiveness of its incentive schemes.
Cash-based long-term incentive scheme
During 2007 the Group introduced a new cash-based long-term incentive scheme (“the Cash Scheme”). The 
maximum conditional award allowable under the three year Cash Scheme is 100% of salary with each award  
vesting no earlier than the third anniversary from date of grant and vesting being subject to achievement of 
performance conditions and continued employment (“the Awards”). When the Awards to the Directors vest, they 
will be expected to use 50% of the net of tax amount to purchase the Company’s shares in the open market until 
such time as a total personal shareholding has been achieved which is equivalent to 100% of base salary. 
Report of the Board on Directors’ Remuneration 
and on Group Remuneration Policy 34 Patsystems plc I Annual Report & Accounts 2008
In the event of a change of control (eg a take-over) the Awards will vest provided the Remuneration Committee 
is satisfied that it is fair and reasonable for them to do so (eg. that the terms of a take-over implicitly reflect 
prospective performance on a scale that would have resulted in full vesting).
The performance conditions attached to the Awards require adjusted fully diluted pre-deferred tax earnings per 
share (EPS) growth from the 2006 financial year to the 2009 financial year of between 10% compound per annum 
to 30% compound per annum for between 30% and 100% of the Award to vest. The Awards vest on a straight line 
basis between minimum and maximum thresholds.

per annum for between 30% and 100% of the Award to vest. The Awards vest on a straight line basis between 
minimum and maximum thresholds. 
When the Awards to the Directors vest, they will be expected, to use 50% of the net of tax amount to purchase 
the Company’s shares in the open market until such time as a total personal shareholding has been achieved which 
is equivalent to 100% of base salary. In the event of a change of control (e.g. a take-over) the Awards will vest 
provided the Remuneration Committee is satisfied that it is fair and reasonable for them to do so (e.g. that the 
terms of a take-over implicitly reflect prospective performance on a scale that would have resulted in full vesting).
The charge to the income statement for the year ended 31 December 2008 in relation to these Awards was £36,000.

Report of the Board on Directors’ Remuneration 
and on Group Remuneration Policy HIGHLIGHTS THE COMPANY THE YEAR IN REVIEW GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
37 Patsystems plc I Annual Report & Accounts 2008
We have audited the Group financial statements of Patsystems plc for the year ended 31 December 2008 which 
comprise the Consolidated income statement, the Consolidated balance sheet, the Consolidated cash flow 
statement, the Consolidated statement of recognised income and expense and the related notes. These Group 
financial statements have been prepared under the accounting policies set out therein.
We have reported separately on the parent company financial statements of Patsystems plc for the year ended 
31 December 2008.
RESPECTIVE RESPONSIBILITIES OF DIRECTORS AND AUDITORS
The directors’ responsibilities for preparing the Annual Report and the Group financial statements in accordance 
with applicable law and International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the European Union are 
set out in the Statement of Directors’ Responsibilities.
Our responsibility is to audit the Group financial statements in accordance with relevant legal and regulatory requirements 
and International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland). This report, including the opinion, has been prepared for and 
only for the company’s members as a body in accordance with Section 235 of the Companies Act 1985 and for no other 
purpose. We do not, in giving this opinion, accept or assume responsibility for any other purpose or to any other person to 
whom this report is shown or into whose hands it may come save where expressly agreed by our prior consent in writing.
We report to you our opinion as to whether the Group financial statements give a true and fair view and whether 
the Group financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 1985. We also report to 
you whether in our opinion the information given in the Directors’ Report is consistent with the Group financial statements. 
In addition we report to you if, in our opinion, the company has not kept proper accounting records, if we have not 
received all the information and explanations we require for our audit, or if information specified by law regarding 
directors’ remuneration and other transactions is not disclosed.
We also report to you whether in our opinion the information given in the Directors’ report is consistent with the 
audited Group financial statements. The information given in the Directors’ report includes that specific information 
presented in the Chairman’s Statement, Chief Executive’s Report, and Finance Director’s Review that is cross referred 
from the review of business section of the Directors’ report.
We read other information contained in the Annual Report and consider whether it is consistent with the audited 
Group financial statements. The other information comprises only the Directors’ Report, the Chairman’s Statement, 
the Chief Executive’s Report, the Finance Director’s Review, the Statement of Corporate Governance and the Report 
of the Board on Directors’ Remuneration and on Group Remuneration Policy. We consider the implications for our 
report if we become aware of any apparent misstatements or material inconsistencies with the Group financial 
statements. Our responsibilities do not extend to any other information.
BASIS OF AUDIT OPINION
We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland) issued by the 
Auditing Practices Board. An audit includes examination, on a test basis, of evidence relevant to the amounts 
and disclosures in the Group financial statements. It also includes an assessment of the significant estimates 
and judgments made by the directors in the preparation of the Group financial statements, and of whether the 
accounting policies are appropriate to the Group’s circumstances, consistently applied and adequately disclosed.
We planned and performed our audit so as to obtain all the information and explanations which we considered 
necessary in order to provide us with sufficient evidence to give reasonable assurance that the Group financial 
statements are free from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or other irregularity or error. In forming our 
opinion we also evaluated the overall adequacy of the presentation of information in the Group financial statements.

1. ACCOUNTINg POLICIES
The principal accounting policies applied in the preparation of these consolidated financial statements are set 
out below. These policies have been consistently applied to all the years presented, unless otherwise stated.
Restatements:
The 2007 comparatives have been restated as the Group has now taken advantage of merger relief.  
As a result the premium on the shares, of £3,222,000, issued in respect of the acquisition of Tamesis in  
2007 have now been included in the other reserve rather than the share premium account as previously 
disclosed. This has resulted in the restatement as detailed below.
Share premium £’000
At 31 December 2007 – as previously reported 7,014
Adjustment (3,222)
At 31 December 2007 – as restated 3,792
Other reserve £’000
At 31 December 2007 – as previously reported 17,348
Adjustment 3,222
At 31 December 2007 – as restated 20,570
In addition £71,000 relating to the cash-based long-term incentive scheme has been reclassified from ‘trade and 
other payables’ to ‘provisions’ in the 2007 comparatives to more accurately reflect the nature of this balance.
1.1 Accounting convention and basis of preparation
These financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting 
Standards (IFRS) and IFRIC interpretations endorsed by the European Union (EU) and with those parts of the 
Companies Act 1985/2006 applicable to companies reporting under IFRS. 
The results and net assets of subsidiary undertakings acquired are included in the consolidated income 
statement and consolidated balance sheet using the acquisition method of accounting from the effective 
date of acquisition.
These consolidated financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention, with 
the exception of financial instruments which are stated in accordance with IAS 39 Financial Instruments: 
Recognition and Measurement.
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with IFRS requires the use of certain critical accounting 
estimates. It also requires management to exercise its judgement in the process of applying the Group’s 
accounting policies. The areas involving a high degree of judgement or complexity, or areas where 
assumptions and estimates are significant to the consolidated financial statements, are disclosed in note 2.
Standards, amendments and interpretations effective in 2008
IFRIC 11, ‘IFRS 2 – Group and treasury share transactions’, provides guidance on whether share-based  
transactions involving treasury shares or involving Group entities (for example, options over a parent’s 
shares) should be accounted for as equity-settled or cash-settled share-based payment transactions in the 
stand-alone accounts of the parent and Group companies. This interpretation does not have an impact 
on the Group’s financial statements. The company’s accounting policy for share-based compensation 
arrangements is already in compliance with the interpretation.  HIGHLIGHTS THE COMPANY THE YEAR IN REVIEW GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
43 Patsystems plc I Annual Report & Accounts 2008
1.1 ACCOUNTING CONVENTION AND BASIS OF PREPARATION continued Standards, amendments and interpretations effective in 2008 but not relevant for the  
Group’s operations
The following standards, amendments and interpretations to published standards are mandatory for 
accounting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2008 but they are not relevant to the Group’s operations:
IFRIC 12, ‘Service concession arrangements’;  
IFRIC 13, ‘Customer loyalty programmes; and 
IFRIC 14, ‘IAS 19 – The limit on a defined benefit asset, minimum funding requirements and  
their interaction’.
Standards, amendments and interpretations to existing standards that are not yet effective and have 
not been adopted early by the Group
The following standards, amendments and interpretations to existing standards have been published and are 
mandatory for the Group’s accounting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2009 or later periods, but the 
Group has not early adopted them:
IFRS 8, ‘Operating Segments’ is effective for accounting periods commencing on or after 1 January 2009  
and introduces new requirements for determining, quantifying and disclosing information relating to the 
business segments in which Group companies operate. A segmental analysis of the Group’s operations 
is given in Note 4 to these financial statements in accordance with the requirements of IAS 14. IFRS 8 
will replace IAS 14. The Group will apply IFRS 8 from 1 January 2009. The expected impact is still being 
assessed in detail by management, but it appears likely that the number of reportable segments, as well 
as the manner in which the segments are reported, will change to be consistent with the Group’s internal 
management reporting. 
 IAS 1 (revised), ‘Presentation of financial statements’ (effective from 1 January 2009). The standard  
is still subject to endorsement by the EU. The Group and company will apply IAS 1 (revised) from 
1 January 2009, subject to endorsement by the EU. It is likely that both the income statement and 
statement of comprehensive income will be presented as performance statements.
 IFRS 3 (revised), ‘Business combinations’ (effective from 1 July 2009). The Group will apply IFRS 3 (revised)  
prospectively to all business combinations from 1 January 2010, subject to endorsement by the EU.
 IFRS 5 (amendment), ‘Non-current assets held-for-sale and discontinued operations’, (and consequential  
amendment to IFRS 1, ‘First-time adoption’) (effective from 1 July 2009). The Group will apply the IFRS 5 
(amendment) prospectively to all partial disposals of subsidiaries from 1 January 2010, subject  
to endorsement by the EU.
 IAS 36 (amendment), ‘Impairment of assets’, (effective from 1 January 2009). The Group and company will  
apply the IAS 36 (amendment) and provide the required disclosure where applicable for impairment tests 
from 1 January 2009, subject to endorsement by the EU.
 IAS 38 (amendment), ‘Intangible assets’, (effective from 1 January 2009). The Group will apply the IAS 38  
(amendment) from 1 January 2009, subject to endorsement by the EU.
The following amendments are not expected to have a material impact on the Group’s financial statements:
 IFRS 2 (amendment), ‘Share-based payment’  
 IFRS 1 (amendment), ‘First time adoption of IFRS’, and IAS 27, ‘Consolidated and separate   

1.2 FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION
Functional and presentation currency
Items included in the financial statements of each of the Group entities are measured using the currency of 
the primary economic environment in which the entity operates (the ‘functional currency’). The consolidated 
financial statements are presented in Pounds Sterling, which is the parent Company’s functional and 
presentation currency.
Transactions and balances
Foreign currency transactions are translated into the functional currency using the exchange rates prevailing 
at the dates of the transactions. Foreign exchange gains and losses resulting from the settlement of 
such transactions and from the translation at year-end exchange rates of monetary assets and liabilities 
denominated in foreign currencies are recognised in the income statement.
Group companies
The results and financial position of all Group entities (none of which has the currency of a hyper-
inflationary economy) that have a functional currency different from the presentation currency are 
translated into the presentation currency as follows:
assets and liabilities for each balance sheet presented are translated at the closing rate at the date   
of that balance sheet;
income and expenses for each income statement are translated at average exchange rates; and 
all resulting exchange differences are recognised in reserves. 
1.3 GOODWILL
Goodwill represents the excess of the cost of an acquisition over the fair value of the Group’s share of the 
net identifiable assets of the acquired subsidiary at the date of acquisition. Goodwill is tested annually 
for impairment and carried at cost less accumulated impairment losses. The carrying value of capitalised 
goodwill is also reviewed if events or changes in circumstances indicate a potential impairment. Any 
impairment is charged to the income statement. Gains and losses on the disposal of an entity include the 
carrying amount of goodwill relating to the entity sold. Goodwill is allocated to cash-generating units for 
the purpose of impairment testing.
1.4 INTANGIBLE ASSETS 
Computer software licences are capitalised on the basis of the costs incurred to acquire and bring to use the 
specific software. The software acquired in the Tamesis acquisition was capitalised at fair value. These costs 
are amortised over their estimated useful lives (three years). Costs associated with maintaining computer 
software programmes are recognised as an expense as incurred.
1.5 IMPAIRMENT OF ASSETS
Assets that have an indefinite useful life are not subject to amortisation and are tested annually for 
impairment and whenever events or changes in circumstance indicate that the carrying value may not be 
recoverable. Assets that are subject to amortisation are tested for impairment whenever events or changes 
in circumstance indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. An impairment loss is recognised for 
the amount by which the assets carrying value exceeds its recoverable amount. The recoverable amount is the 
higher of an asset’s fair value less costs to sell and value in use. For the purposes of assessing impairment, assets 
are grouped at the lowest levels for which there are separately identifiable cash flows (cash generating units).
1.6 RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT
Research expenditure is recognised as an expense as incurred. Costs directly attributable to development are 
capitalised as intangible assets when it is probable that the development will provide economic benefits, 
considering its commercial and technical feasibility, resources are available for the development and costs can 
be measured reliably. Other development expenditures are recognised as costs when incurred. Capitalised 
product development is amortised from completion of development over periods of between 3 and 5 years. Notes to the Financial Statements
46 Patsystems plc I Annual Report & Accounts 2008
1.7 PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT
Property, plant and equipment is shown at cost less subsequent depreciation. Cost includes expenditure that 
is directly attributable to the acquisition of the items.
Depreciation on assets is calculated using the straight-line method to reduce the cost of each asset to its 
estimated residual value over its estimated useful life, as follows:
Leasehold improvements – over the period of the lease 
Plant and equipment – over 3 years 
Office furniture, fixtures and fittings – over 4 years 
1.8 CURRENT AND DEFERRED INCOME TAxES
The current income tax charge is calculated on the basis of the tax laws enacted or substantively enacted 
at the balance sheet date in the countries in which the Company and its subsidiaries operate and generate 
taxable income. Management periodically evaluates positions taken in tax returns with respect to 
situations in which applicable tax regulations are subject to interpretation and establishes provisions where 
appropriate on the basis of amounts expected to be paid to the tax authorities.
Deferred income tax is provided in full, using the liability method, on temporary differences arising between 
the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts in the consolidated financial statements. The 
deferred income tax is not accounted for on the initial recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction, 
other than a business combination, that at the time of the transaction affects neither accounting nor taxable 
profit or loss. Deferred income tax is determined using tax rates (and laws) that have been enacted or 
substantially enacted by the balance sheet date and are expected to apply when the related deferred income 
tax asset is realised or the deferred income tax liability is settled.
Deferred income tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be 
available against which the temporary differences can be utilised.
Deferred income tax is provided on temporary differences arising on investments in subsidiaries except 
where the timing of the reversal of the temporary difference is controlled by the Group and it is probable 
that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
Deferred income tax balances are not discounted.
1.9 INVENTORIES
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value. 
1.10 FINANCIAL ASSETS
The Group classifies its financial assets between “assets at fair value through profit or loss” and “loans 
and receivables”. The classification depends on the purpose for which the financial assets were acquired. 
Management determines the classification of its financial assets at initial recognition. 
Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss are financial assets held for trading. A financial asset 
is classified in this category if acquired principally for the purpose of selling in the short term. Derivatives 
are also categorised as held for trading unless they are designated as hedges. Assets in this category are 
classified as current assets.
Purchases and sales of financial assets are recognised on the trade-date – the date on which the Group 
commits to purchase or sell the asset. Financial assets are initially recognised at fair value and transaction 
costs are expensed in the income statement. Financial assets are derecognised when the rights to receive 
cash flows from the investments have expired or have been transferred and the Group has transferred 
substantially all risks and rewards of ownership. 
Gains or losses arising from changes in the fair value of the financial assets are presented in the income 
statement in the period in which they arise. 
The Group assesses at each balance sheet date whether there is objective evidence that a financial asset or a 
Group of financial assets is impaired. Impairment testing of trade receivables is described in note 1.12.
continued HIGHLIGHTS THE COMPANY THE YEAR IN REVIEW GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
47 Patsystems plc I Annual Report & Accounts 2008
1.11 ACCOUNTING FOR DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AND HEDGING ACTIVITIES
The Group enters into forward currency contracts and options in order to hedge against the cash flow  
risk of foreign currency exchange rate movements. Derivatives are initially recognised at fair value on  
the date the contract is entered into and subsequently re-measured in future periods at their fair value.  
The movement in fair values is taken to the income statement.
The fair value of forward contracts is determined using forward exchange market rates at the balance sheet date.
1.12 TRADE RECEIVABLES
Trade receivables are recognised initially at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost using the 
effective interest method, less provision for impairment. A provision for impairment of trade receivables is 
established when there is objective evidence that the Group will not be able to collect all amounts due under the 
original terms of the receivables. Significant financial difficulties of the debtor, probability that the debtor will 
enter bankruptcy or financial reorganisation and default or delinquency in payments are considered indicators 
that the trade receivable may be impaired. The amount of the provision is the difference between the asset’s 
carrying amount and the present value of estimated future cash flows, discounted at the original effective 
interest rate. The carrying amount of the asset is reduced through the use of an allowance account, and the 
amount of the loss is recognised in the income statement within “operating expenses”. When a trade receivable 
is uncollectible, it is written off against the allowance account for trade receivables. Subsequent recoveries 
of amounts previously written off are credited against “operating expenses” in the income statement. 
1.13 CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS
Cash and cash equivalents includes cash in hand, cash in transit, deposits held at call with banks, other short 
term highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less, and bank overdrafts.
Cash in transit represents the net amount of monies due to Group companies that have been paid to 
independent clearing agents and are pending release by overseas withholding tax authorities.
1.14 TRADE PAYABLES
Trade payables are recognised initially at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost using the 
effective interest method.
1.15 LEASES
Costs in respect of operating leases are charged to the income statement on a straight line basis over 
the lease term. 
1.16 PROVISIONS
Provisions are measured at the present value of the expenditures expected to be required to settle the 
obligation using a pre-tax rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the 
risks specific to the obligation. 
1.17 SEGMENT REPORTING
A business segment is a Group of assets and operations engaged in providing products or services that 
are subject to risks and returns that are different from those of other business segments. A geographical 
segment is engaged in providing products or services within a particular economic environment that are 
subject to risks and returns that are different from those of other economic environments.
All direct costs of a segment are included in that segment’s result.  Notes to the Financial Statements
48 Patsystems plc I Annual Report & Accounts 2008
1.18 REVENUE RECOGNITION
Revenue comprises the fair value of the sale of goods and services, net of value added tax.
Revenue is recognised as follows:
Non-refundable installation income, consultancy and software development projects: revenue is taken   
to the income statement in line with the performance of the work. 
Monthly end user or lot charges, monthly maintenance and income on any rentals – these are credited   
to the income statement in the period in which the service is provided.
Income from perpetual licences – this is recognised in the income statement when the Company has  
fulfilled all of its obligations in accordance with the terms for acceptance set out in the customer 
contracts and the Company has reasonable assurance over the collectability of the debt.
1.19 EMPLOYEE BENEFITS
Pension obligations
The Group operates a defined contribution scheme which is open to UK and US employees.
The Group pays contributions to publicly or privately administered pension insurance schemes on a mandatory, 
contractual or voluntary basis. The Group has no further payment obligations once the contributions have 
been paid. The contributions are recognised as employee benefit expense when they are due.
Termination benefits
Termination benefits are payable when employment is terminated before the normal retirement date,  
or when an employee accepts voluntary redundancy in exchange for these benefits. The Group recognises 
termination benefits when it is demonstrably committed to either: terminating the employment of current 
employees according to a detailed formal plan without possibility of withdrawal; or providing termination 
benefits as a result of an offer made to encourage voluntary redundancy.
Share-based benefits
The Group operates two share options schemes; the Enterprise Management Incentive Scheme and the 2003 
Share Option Scheme (Inland Revenue unapproved). 
The fair value of options is recognised as an employee benefit expense with a corresponding increase in 
reserves over the vesting period. The proceeds received net of any directly attributable transaction costs are 
credited to share capital (nominal value) and share premium when the options are exercised. A detailed 
explanation of how the fair values have been derived can be seen in note 23.
Cash-based long-term incentive benefits
The Group has introduced a cash-based long-term incentive scheme (“the Cash Scheme”) in 2007 and 
awards were granted to the Executive Directors and to certain senior and key employees. These awards 
are conditional upon the rate of growth in fully diluted pre-deferred tax EPS over the period from 
31 December 2006 to 31 December 2009. The cost of these awards has been estimated based on projected  
EPS growth and is recognised as an employee benefit expense on a straight line basis over the period from 
grant to 31 December 2009.
Other benefits
UK employees are also entitled to private medical, death in service insurance, critical illness and  
long-term sickness insurance and subsidised health club membership. The costs of providing these  
benefits are recognised as employee benefit expense as they fall due.
This year the Group has introduced a flexible benefits scheme that enables employees to tailor their total 
remuneration packages to meet their own individual lifestyle and family requirements. 
1.20 DIVIDEND DISTRIBUTIONS 
Final dividend distributions to the Company’s shareholders are recognised as liabilities in the Group’s 
financial statements in the period in which the dividends are approved by the Company’s shareholders. 
Interim dividend distributions to the Company’s shareholders are recognised as liabilities in the Group’s 
financial statements when paid.

2. CRITICAL ACCOUNTINg ESTIMATES AND JUDgEMENTS
Estimates and judgements are continually evaluated and are based on historical experience and other 
factors, including expectations of future events that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances.
The Group makes estimates and assumptions regarding the future. The resulting accounting estimates will, 
by definition, seldom equal the related actual results. The estimates and assumptions that have a significant 
risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next 
financial year are the assumptions used for recognising the deferred tax asset detailed in note 15.
The Group has also applied judgement in assessing the following areas:
IRFS 2 share based payment charge and the provision for the cash-based long-term incentive scheme,  
where judgement has been applied as to the number of awards expected to vest.
Capitalisation of research and development costs. 
Impairment reviews for intangible assets. 
3. FINANCIAL RISk MANAgEMENT
The Group’s activities expose it to a variety of financial risks and it has developed and operates an overall 
risk management programme that recognises the unpredictability of financial markets and seeks to minimise 
potential adverse effects on the Group’s financial performance. 
Financial risk management is under the control of the Finance Director and is carried out centrally for the 
Group in compliance with policies approved and monitored by the full Board. The Board regularly reviews 
the effectiveness of these policies examining specific areas including foreign exchange risk, interest rate risk, 
credit risk and the extent to which financial instruments are being used to hedge certain risk exposures. 
3.1 MARKET RISK 
The principal market risk to which the the Group is exposed is foreign currency risk on sales, purchases and 
cash balances that are denominated in a currency other than Sterling. The principal currency giving rise 
to this risk is the US dollar. Patsystems’ policy is to carry forward cover for 75% of US$/£ net anticipated 
exposure for 12 months forward. Forward cover is achieved through a mixture of forward contracts and 
options. This policy has remained unchanged throughout both 2008 and 2007 although the level of cover 
and the exposure to risks on other foreign currencies are kept under regular review.
The average US$/UK£ exchange rate used in the 2008 income statement was 1.84 (2007: 2.01). The average 
rate of the hedges in place at 31 December 2008 for 2009 was 1.77 (2007 for 2008: 1.99). The fair value of 
these hedges is recognised as a financial liability of £853,000 (2007: asset £30,000) on the Group balance 
sheet at the year end.
The Group has certain investments in foreign operations, whose net assets are exposed to foreign currency 
translation risk. This exposure is minimised by a Group policy requiring individual subsidiaries to remit any surplus 
funds to the parent company to facilitate central management as set out above and to enable each individual 
subsidiary to match remaining assets and liabilities denominated in their specific functional currencies.
During the year ended 31 December 2008 the US$/UK£ exchange rate fluctuated between 1.45 and 1.99 
(2007 between 1.96 and 2.07). At 31 December 2008, if the US$ had weakened/strengthened by 20% against 
the UK£ with all other variables held constant, post tax profit for the year would have been £647,000 
(2007: £571,000) lower/higher, mainly as a result of foreign exchange gains/losses on translation of US$ 
denominated trade receivables.
The Group is also exposed to interest rate risks on the fair values of the hedging instruments that it holds 
and on the cash flows arising from any interest bearing cash deposits. These assets are regularly realised to 
settle trade and other payables as part of the Group’s management of its liquidity risks. The Group has no 
material borrowings and accordingly, exposures to interest rate risks are not regarded as significant. Notes to the Financial Statements
50 Patsystems plc I Annual Report & Accounts 2008
3.2  CREDIT RISK 
Credit risk arises from cash and cash equivalents and from credit exposures to the Group’s customers, 
including outstanding receivables and committed transactions. Credit risk is managed centrally with regular 
reports of exposures reviewed by the Board. The Group does not set individual credit limits but will seek 
to ensure that counterparties enter into legally enforceable contracts that include settlement terms that 
demonstrate the counterparties’ commitment to the transaction and minimise this risk exposure. 
The Board does not assess the credit quality of financial assets by reference to external credit ratings, but will 
regularly examine the ageing of financial assets and individual counterparty historic default rates. An aged 
analysis of trade receivables at 31 December 2008 is set out in note 17. 
3.3  LIQUIDITY RISK 
The Group has no borrowings or committed credit lines and its liquidity management policy is carried out 
at a local level and involves projecting cash flows in major currencies and considering the levels of liquid 
assets necessary to meet these. Requirements are overseen by the Board with Group levels of cash and cash 
equivalents reviewed on a monthly basis. A maturity analysis of trade and other payables is shown in note 19.
3.4  CAPITAL RISK MANAGEMENT
The Group’s objectives when managing capital are to safeguard the Group’s ability to continue as a going 
concern in order to provide returns for shareholders and benefits for other stakeholders. Consistent with others 
in the industry and of its size, the Group believes that an optimum capital structure is currently achieved entirely 
through equity and with no net debt. Total equity at 31 December 2008 was £20,054,000 (2007: £18,694,000).
In order to maintain or adjust the capital structure, the Group may adjust the amount of dividends paid to 
shareholders, return capital to shareholders, issue new shares or raise future funds through debt.

The Parent company accounts are set out in pages 75 to 83.
10. EARNINgS PER ORDINARY ShARE
In accordance with IAS 33, the calculation of earnings per ordinary share is based upon:
(a) Basic earnings per share  
Basic earnings per share is calculated by dividing the earnings attributable to ordinary shareholders by the 
weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue during the year:
2008 2007
Profit for the year attributable to equity holders of the company £616,000 £1,844,000
Weighted average number of shares 178,982,340 168,090,000
Basic earnings per share 0.3p 1.1p
(b) Diluted earnings per share  
Diluted earnings per share is calculated by adjusting the weighted average number of ordinary shares 
outstanding to assume conversions of all dilutive potential ordinary shares. 
The Group has one category of dilutive potential ordinary shares: share options.
For share options a calculation is performed to determine the number of shares that could have been 
acquired at fair value (determined as the average annual market price of the Group’s shares) based  
on the monetary value of the subscription rights attached to the outstanding options. 
The number of shares calculated above is compared with the number of shares that would have been issued 
assuming the exercise of the share options.

The increase in goodwill in the year is in relation to the 2005 acquisition of Tamesis and represents the 
difference between the estimated contingent consideration at 31 December 2007 and the final settlement 
made in the year.
The goodwill is all held in Europe.
Impairment review
The recoverable amount for the cash generating unit has been measured based on a value in use calculation. 
The calculations use pre-tax profits based on budgets approved by management for the year 2009. Cash 
flows beyond this are based on a growth rate of 2.25%. A pre-tax discount rate of 10% has been applied to 
the calculations.
As the value in use is greater than the carrying value there is no impairment in the period and the carrying 
value of goodwill represents the excess of the cost of acquisition over the fair value of the Group’s share of 
the net identifiable assets of the acquired subsidiary at the date of acquisition. Notes to the Financial Statements

17. TRADE AND OThER RECEIVABLES continued Trade receivables that are less that three months past due are not considered impaired. As of 31 December 2008, 
trade receivables of £882,000 (2007: £806,000) were past due but not impaired. These relate to a number 
of independent customers for whom there is no indication of financial difficulties or recent history of 
default. The Group is in contact with these customers and obtained assurances from which it believes  
that the amounts receivable will be collected in full with no additional cost to the Group.
Provisions for the portion of individually impaired trade receivables assessed to be irrecoverable at  
31 December 2008 totaled £134,000 (2007: £83,000). These relate to customers where there are indications 
of financial difficulties or disputes that are unlikely to be resolved without further costs to the Group.

The creation and release of provisions for impaired receivables has been included in “operating expenses”  
in the income statement. Amounts charged to the allowance account are generally written off when there  
is no expectation of recovering additional cash.
The other classes within trade and other receivables do not contain impaired assets.
The maximum exposure to credit risk at the reporting date is the fair value of each class of receivable 
mentioned above. The Group does not hold any collateral as security.

23. ShARE OPTION SChEMES continued 
Note e: These options were granted under a special award of the Enterprise Management Incentive (EMI) 
Scheme. One third of these options can be exercised after a period of three years after the date of 
the grant. Two thirds of these options can be exercised after a period of three years after the date 
of the grant but subject to achieving company performance targets.
Note f: These options were granted under a special award of Part B (Inland Revenue Unapproved) of the 
Patsystems plc 2003 Share Option Scheme, exercise conditions are as per note e.
Note g: These options were granted under a special award of the Enterprise Management Incentive (EMI) 
Scheme. These options can be exercised after a period of three years after the date of the grant but 
subject to achieving company performance targets.
Note h: These options were granted under a special award of Part B (Inland Revenue Unapproved) of the 
Patsystems plc 2003 Share Option Scheme, exercise conditions are as per note g.
Note i: These options were granted under a special award of Part B (Inland Revenue Unapproved) of the 
Patsystems plc 2003 Share Option Scheme. These options became exercisable on 31 December 2008.
The weighted average fair value per share at the measurement date of options granted during the year was 
nil p (2007:14.0p).
The weighted average share price at the date of grant of options granted during the year was nil p (2007: 28.1p). 
For the options that were exercised during the year, the weighted average share price at the date of exercise 
was 23p (2007: 26p).
The weighted average remaining contractual life of options outstanding at the year end is 6.7 years  
(2007: 7.6 years).
The total fair value that was charged to the income statement in relation to the share options was £329,000 
(2007: £210,000), all of which related to equity settled share-based payment transactions.
The fair values of the options have been calculated using the Binomial Model. The model takes into account 
the following factors in determining the fair value of an option:
(a) Share price and exercise price 
Share prices are closing share prices as at the date of grant. Exercise prices are listed in the above schedule.
(b) Expected term of the options
It is assumed that the expected life of the options under consideration is 5 years. 
(c) Volatility
Volatility of the Company’s share price has been calculated as the annualised standard deviation of daily 
continuously compounded returns on the Company’s stock, derived from the Company’s historical share 
prices, adjusted for splits, over 5 years back from each date of grant.
(d) Risk-free interest rate
The risk-free rates of interest are assumed to be the yield to maturity on a UK Gilt Strip with the term to 
maturity equal to the expected life of the option. 
(e) Dividends
The valuations take account of the expected future dividend yield at the date of each grant.

Independent Auditors’ Report to the Members of Patsystems plc
We have audited the parent company financial statements of Patsystems plc for the year ended 31 December 2008 
which comprise the Balance sheet and the related notes. These parent company financial statements have been 
prepared under the accounting policies set out therein. 
We have reported separately on the Group financial statements of Patsystems plc for the year ended 31 December 2008.
RESPECTIVE RESPONSIBILITIES OF DIRECTORS AND AUDITORS
The directors’ responsibilities for preparing the Annual Report and the parent company financial statements in 
accordance with applicable law and United Kingdom Accounting Standards (United Kingdom Generally Accepted 
Accounting Practice) are set out in the Statement of Directors’ Responsibilities.
Our responsibility is to audit the parent company financial statements in accordance with relevant legal and 
regulatory requirements and International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland). This report, including the 
opinion, has been prepared for and only for the company’s members as a body in accordance with Section 235 of 
the Companies Act 1985 and for no other purpose. We do not, in giving this opinion, accept or assume responsibility 
for any other purpose or to any other person to whom this report is shown or into whose hands it may come save 
where expressly agreed by our prior consent in writing.
We report to you our opinion as to whether the parent company financial statements give a true and fair view and 
whether the parent company financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies 
Act 1985. We report to you whether in our opinion the information given in the Directors’ Report is consistent with 
the parent company financial statements. 
In addition we report to you if, in our opinion, the company has not kept proper accounting records, if we have not 
received all the information and explanations we require for our audit, or if information specified by law regarding 
directors’ remuneration and other transactions is not disclosed.
We read other information contained in the Annual Report and consider whether it is consistent with the audited 
parent company financial statements. The other information comprises only the Directors’ Report. We consider the 
implications for our report if we become aware of any apparent misstatements or material inconsistencies with the 
parent company financial statements. Our responsibilities do not extend to any other information.
BASIS OF AUDIT OPINION 
We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland) issued by the 
Auditing Practices Board. An audit includes examination, on a test basis, of evidence relevant to the amounts and 
disclosures in the parent company financial statements. It also includes an assessment of the significant estimates and 
judgments made by the directors in the preparation of the parent company financial statements, and of whether the 
accounting policies are appropriate to the company’s circumstances, consistently applied and adequately disclosed.
We planned and performed our audit so as to obtain all the information and explanations which we considered necessary 
in order to provide us with sufficient evidence to give reasonable assurance that the parent company financial statements 
are free from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or other irregularity or error. In forming our opinion we  
also evaluated the overall adequacy of the presentation of information in the parent company financial statements.
OPINION
In our opinion:
the parent company financial statements give a true and fair view, in accordance with United Kingdom  
Generally Accepted Accounting Practice, of the state of the company’s affairs as at 31 December 2008;
the parent company financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 1985; and 
the information given in the Directors’ Report is consistent with the parent company financial statements. 

1. ACCOUNTINg POLICIES
The financial statements have been prepared on the historical cost basis of accounting and in accordance 
with applicable accounting standards in the United Kingdom. 
The principal accounting policies applied in the preparation of these financial statements are set out below. 
These policies have been consistently applied to all the years presented, unless otherwise stated.
Restatement:
The 2007 comparatives have been restated as the Company has now taken advantage of merger relief. As a 
result the shares issued in respect of the acquisition of Tamesis in 2007 have now been included at nominal 
value rather than incorporating the share premium. This has resulted in the restatement of the investment, 
contingent consideration and share premium account as detailed below.
Investments £’000
At 31 December 2007 – as previously reported 5,106
Adjustment (3,501)
At 31 December 2007 – as restated 1,605
Contingent consideration £’000

At 31 December 2007 – as previously reported 7,014
Adjustment (3,222)
At 31 December 2007 – as restated 3,792
1.1 INVESTMENTS 
Investments in subsidiaries are stated at cost less any provision for impairment. Where an acquisition 
satisfies the provisions of sections 131 to 134 of the Companies Act 1985, merger relief is available and the 
investment is stated at nominal value of shares issued plus the value of any other consideration.
1.2 OPERATING LEASES
Costs in respect of operating leases are charged to the Profit and Loss Account on a straight line basis over 
the lease term. 
1.3 CURRENT AND DEFERRED INCOME TAxES
The current income tax charge is calculated on the basis of the tax laws enacted or substantively enacted at 
the Balance Sheet date. Management periodically evaluates positions taken in tax returns with respect to 
situations in which applicable tax regulations are subject to interpretation and establishes provisions where 
appropriate on the basis of amounts expected to be paid to the tax authorities.
Deferred taxation is recognised in respect of timing differences that have originated but not reversed at the 
Balance Sheet date, where transactions or events that result in an obligation to pay more tax in the future or 
a right to pay less tax in the future have occurred at the Balance Sheet date.
A net deferred tax asset is regarded as recoverable and therefore recognised only when, on the basis of all 
available evidence, it can be regarded as more likely than not that there will be sufficient taxable profits to utilise 
carried forward tax losses and against which the reversal of underlying timing differences can be deducted.
Deferred tax is measured at the average tax rates that are expected to apply in the periods in which 
the timing differences are expected to reverse based on tax rates and laws that have been enacted or 
substantively enacted by the Balance Sheet date. Deferred tax is measured on a non-discounted basis.

1. ACCOUNTINg POLICIES CONTINUED
1.4 RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS
Financial Reporting Standard (FRS) 8, “Related Party Transactions”, requires the disclosure of the details of 
material transactions between the reporting entity and related parties. The Company has taken advantage 
of exemptions under FRS 8 not to disclose transactions between Group companies.
1.5 SHARE-BASED PAYMENTS
The Group operates two share options schemes; the Enterprise Management Incentive Scheme and the 2003 
Share Option Scheme (Inland Revenue unapproved). 
The fair value of options is recognised as an employee benefit expense with a corresponding increase in 
reserves over the vesting period. The proceeds received net of any directly attributable transaction costs are 
credited to share capital (nominal value) and share premium when the options are exercised. 
1.6 CASH FLOW STATEMENT 
The Company is the Parent Company of the Patsystems plc Group and is included in the consolidated 
financial statements of Patsystems plc. Consequently, the Company has taken advantage of the exemption 
from preparing a cash flow statement under the terms of Financial Reporting Standard 1 (revised 1996).
1.7 DIVIDEND DISTRIBUTIONS
Final dividend distributions to the Company’s shareholders are recognised as liabilities in the Company’s 
financial statements in the period in which the dividends are approved by the Company’s shareholders. 
Interim dividend distributions to the Company’s shareholders are recognised as liabilities in the Company’s 
financial statements when paid.
2. DIRECTORS AND EMPLOYEES
The Parent Company does not employ any Directors or employees.
3. PROFIT AND LOSS ACCOUNT 
The profit for the year dealt with in the accounts of the Company was £1,196,000 (2007: £656,000).

The weighted average fair value per share at the measurement date of options granted during the year was 
nil p (2007:14.0p).
The weighted average share price at the date of grant of options granted during the year was nil p (2007: 28.1p). 
For the options that were exercised during the year, the weighted average share price at the date of exercise 
was 23p (2007: 26p).
The weighted average remaining contractual life of options outstanding at the year end is 6.7 years 
(2007: 7.6 years).
The total fair value that was charged to the income statement in relation to the share options was £329,000 
(2007: £210,000), all of which related to equity settled share based payment transactions.
The fair values of the options have been calculated using the Binomial Model. The model takes into account 
the following factors in determining the fair value of an option:
(a) Share Price and Exercise Price 
Share prices are closing share prices as at the date of grant. Exercise prices are listed in the above schedule.
(b) Expected Term of the Options
It is assumed that the expected life of the options under consideration is 5 years. 
(c) Volatility
Volatility of the Company’s share price has been calculated as the annualised standard deviation of daily 
continuously compounded returns on the Company’s stock, derived from the Company’s historical share 
prices, adjusted for splits, over 5 years back from each date of grant.
(d) Risk-Free Interest Rate
The risk-free rates of interest are assumed to be the yield to maturity on a UK Gilt Strip with the term 
to maturity equal to the expected life of the option. 
(e) Dividends
The valuations take account of the expected future dividend yield at the date of each grant.

Our services are designed to meet  
the needs of the UK business market, 
from small businesses to national 
enterprises. We do not compete in 
either the residential market or the 
international market. Our focus is on 
software-based services that we can 
supply from the core of our network 
(i.e. cloud-based) and we minimise our 
involvement with equipment on the 
customer’s premises.
SIP Trunking: Business Grade VoIP
SIP Trunking is increasingly being used by 
business customers to replace traditional 
ISDN lines. At the end of 2015, there 
were estimated to be 1.95m SIP Trunking 
channels deployed in the UK, of which 
Gamma has a 19% share and is the market 
leader. The broader directly relevant 
market, however, is the 2.9m business 
ISDN channels for which SIP Trunking 
offers a modern, more cost-effective 
alternative. Gamma’s growth rate in sales 
of SIP Trunking services in 2015 was 54%. 
Cloud PBX: A phone system in the Cloud
The total UK business PBX market 
(including on-premise and hosted) is 
approximately 17.6m seats, of which  
close to 2.2m are hosted PBX seats.  
Cloud PBX services are increasingly 
replacing traditional, on-premise PBX 
infrastructure with seat volumes growing  
at circa 32% per annum including private 
Cloud PBXs. In 2015, Gamma’s growth  
rate in Cloud PBX seats was 67%. 
Inbound
The market for Inbound Call Control 
Services ranges from large enterprises to 
small organisations for which professionally 
managing inbound calls (such as for sales 
and customer services) is important as it 
enables them to queue, record and route 
calls effectively. Gamma grew the base of 
telephone numbers in 2015 by over 30%. 
Ethernet
Ethernet is becoming the dominant Wide 
Area Network transmission technology 
because it can transport large amounts  
of any type of data in a fast, assured and 
economic manner. Ethernet connectivity 
between Local Area Networks enables 
multiple services and applications to 
operate seamlessly across different 
geographical locations. Gamma has 
substantially increased Ethernet 
connections in the past 12 months,  
and views Ethernet as a key enabling 
technology for its more strategic services 
such as SIP Trunking and Cloud PBX. 
Broadband
Gamma offers a quality business-grade 
broadband service and does not compete 
for the residential market. Connections 
grew by 37% in 2015. 
Mobile services
Gamma acts as a virtual operator, either 
under its own brand or that of its channel 
partner. In 2015, Gamma’s market share  
of the UK business market stood at just 
0.7%, leaving plenty of opportunity for 
further growth. At the end of 2014, Gamma 
acquired a mobile infrastructure enabling it 
to develop and manage a range of mobile 
services, effectively becoming a full MVNO. 
The first of these services will be launched 
in the first half of 2016. 
Routes to market
Gamma sells all of its products through 
both the indirect channels (via 834 channel 
partners) which generates 79% of its 
revenue, as well as selling to end users 
through the direct channel. 
Major trends impacting 
growth in our market: 
•  The shift of hardware to 
the Cloud
•  Availability of optical fibre 
access for businesses 
•  The growth in  
smartphones
•  Growing convergence of 
communications and IT

“ We evaluated all the usual suspects to find  
a partner capable of transforming our 
communications estate to help us achieve  
our operational, commercial and business goals 
for the coming years. Gamma then delivered 
leading capabilities throughout the whole

 Andrew Feldon 
 IT Director of Taylor Wimpey plc  6
2015 has been an excellent year  
for Gamma, with revenue and profit 
continuing to increase.
Introduction
I am very pleased to present the 
full year report on the results of 
Gamma Communications plc for the 
year ended 31 December 2015, my first 
following its successful IPO and listing 
on the AIM on 10 October 2014.
Gamma operates in the very dynamic 
UK communications market; a market 
that is increasingly hard to define as the 
boundary between communications 
and IT blurs. This presents many new 
opportunities.
Overview of results
Group turnover for the year ended 
31 December 2015 increased by £18.6m 
to £191.8m (2014: £173.2m), an increase 
of 10.7% on the prior year. Of this increase 
£15.1m came from the indirect channels 
business where turnover increased to 
£152.0m (2014: £136.9m), while £3.5m 
came from the direct business which 
saw turnover increase to £39.8m 
(2014: £36.3m). Gross profit for the year 
to 31 December 2015 rose to £82.3m an 
increase of 21.7% compared to the £67.6m 
achieved in 2014, whilst the gross margin 
increased to 42.9% (2014: 39.0%). 
Adjusted EBITDA, (being before 
exceptional items and share based 
payments) for the Group increased 
by 22.5% to £28.3m (2014: £23.1m).
Adjusted fully diluted earnings per share 
for the year ended 31 December 2015 
increased by 19.3% to 17.9p (2014: 15.0p) 
(EPS is adjusted for share based 
payments, exceptional items and 
the tax effect thereon).
The net operating cash inflow (pre-tax 
and non-recurring income from the ladder 
pricing settlement) for the year was £25.3m 
compared to £19.4m in 2014. 
This represents a cash to adjusted EBITDA 
conversion ratio in respect of 2015 of 89%, 
compared to 84% for 2014. Net cash 
as at 31 December 2015 amounted to 
£24.8m, which is significantly up from 
£13.4m as at 31 December 2014. 
Dividend 
As stated at the time of the IPO, Gamma is 
committed to a progressive dividend policy. 
The Board is therefore pleased to propose 
a final dividend, in respect of the year 
ended 31 December 2015, of 4.4p per 
share (2014: 3.95p) which, subject to the 
necessary shareholder approval at the 
forthcoming AGM, will be payable on 
23 June 2016 to shareholders on the 
register on Friday 3 June 2016. When 
added to the 2.2p interim dividend this 
makes a total dividend of 6.6p for the 
year as a whole.
Exceptional gain
Gamma had previously reported a 
contingent asset which related to ladder 
pricing. Ladder pricing was a mechanism 
which was used by fixed line operators 
to bill other operators for calls to certain 08 
numbers. Gamma had been in commercial 
negotiations for a settlement in regard to 
its ladder pricing policy with the affected 
operators and these have now concluded, 
resulting in an exceptional gain to 
Gamma of £5.7m for the year ending 
31 December 2015.
Business development 
I am pleased that the business has grown 
across a range of fronts, the number of 
channel partners has grown as has the 
average volume of trading with each 
partner. The shift to more strategic products 
continues and the direct business has 
grown successfully, winning larger 
accounts, such as Taylor Wimpey in the 
Enterprise market and Peabody Housing  
in the charity sector.

Financial statements Corporate governance Strategic report
Gamma Communications plc Annual Report and Accounts 2015
Gaining a strong position on the new 
Government Crown Commercial Services 
framework (RM1045) opens up new 
markets in the public sector, both directly 
and through our channel partners, and 
we have strengthened our sales team 
in this area.
In December 2014 Gamma purchased 
the control equipment that provides the 
core of a mobile network. The Board is very 
pleased with the progress that was made 
during 2015 in building this capability into  
a “full MVNO” ready for a planned service 
launch in June 2016. 
Given BT’s acquisition of EE, the 
timing of that launch is very opportune. 
Business customers are increasingly 
looking to buy all their communications 
services from a single supplier and this 
new mobile capability positions Gamma 
as one of only a small number of operators 
that have full technical capability across 
fixed telephony, mobile telephony and 
data services.
Board and employees 
On 1 December 2015 I was delighted  
to welcome Richard Bligh onto the Board 
as Chief Operating Officer reporting to 
Bob Falconer, Chief Executive Officer. 
Richard had previously been the 
Company’s Group Marketing Director 
and Managing Director of Gamma’s Direct 
Mid-Market Channel. Richard has been 
with Gamma since 2004 and has over 
20 years’ experience in telecoms 
in a variety of marketing and business 
development roles. 
The senior executives, managers and 
employees are the bedrock of Gamma  
and they have significantly contributed  
to the creation of the successful company 
we have today. I should like to thank them 
for their consistent hard work and 
continued support.
Gamma is fully supportive of apprenticeship 
schemes and employee volunteering 
within the local community and has a 
policy of matched funding for charitable 
activities by staff. Employee motivation 
and development are fundamental 
principles of Gamma and lead to a 
stronger and more successful business.
Outlook 
The Board looks forward enthusiastically  
to 2016 and beyond. The emerging market 
for converged fixed and mobile services 
presents many opportunities, and Gamma 
is well placed to exploit these with its clear 
focus on the UK business market and its 
commitment to new product development. 
We believe that Gamma has the 
experience, resources and capabilities  
to continue to achieve its objectives.

Highly cash generative with  
a resilient business model,  
a broad customer base and  
low customer concentration, 
Gamma has seen strong growth 
driven by repeating revenues.
Gamma is a rapidly growing, technology-
based provider of communications services 
to the UK business market. Gamma’s 
services, such as Cloud PBX, Inbound Call 
Control Services and SIP Trunking, are 
designed to meet the increasingly complex 
voice, data and mobility requirements of 
businesses, through the exploitation of its 
know-how and own intellectual property.
Gamma also provides services such as 
business-grade broadband, Ethernet, 
mobile and data services. Also, as a 
consequence of its history, Gamma has 
a substantial voice service capability, 
completing its comprehensive range 
of communication services.
Growing our business
The business has consistently grown its 
margins over the last six years and this 
growth has come from right across our 
different channels. We do not have a 
target mix for indirect and direct business 
– we will let the business market decide. 
This growth has come despite industry 
reductions in regulated prices and difficult 
economic conditions. 
Strategic services
The single biggest factor in the success 
of the business over the last six years 
has been the transition from selling 
traditional services, such as calls and lines, 
to providing the more strategic services of 
Cloud PBX, SIP Trunking and Inbound Call 
Control Services. For the customer, these 
services have three inherent advantages 
over the services they replace: they cost 
less, they are more flexible and feature-
rich, and they do not require significant 
capital expenditure to implement. 
For Gamma, the investment in product 
development is returned with improved 
margins, longer contracts and lower churn 
as the products are more integral to a 
business operation. The enabling services 
of Ethernet, mobile and broadband (see 
service portfolio diagram) are prerequisites 
for providing the strategic services and 
for ensuring that Gamma, and its channel 
partners, maximise the revenue opportunity 
from each customer.
Public sector
This is becoming an increasingly important 
market for Gamma, both through a number 
of key channel partners, who are active and 
successful in the public sector, and our own 
direct sales capability. Through framework 
agreements we now have a significant 
presence in education, health and local 
government. Gamma is now on the new

under-represented.
Our services
Our portfolio comprises voice, data and 
mobile services that are sold indirectly 
through channel partners and directly to 
end users. These services are sold in a 
standard, repeatable way to both partners 
and customers. What creates value and 
differentiation in our services is the way we 
deliver them to our partners via the Gamma 
portal. The business invests significantly in 
software resources to automate, simplify 
and speed up the provisioning and billing 
of our services. This focus on “ease of use” 
for all our services across one platform is 
a key differentiator, and reduces the back 
office costs of our partners.  10
The outlook for Gamma remains 
positive, and we look forward to 
continuing the strong momentum  
in the business and delivering 
sustainable long term value for  
our stakeholders.
Following its first full financial year on 
AIM, 2015 saw an excellent financial and 
operational performance from Gamma with 
strong growth in strategic products.
Overall, revenue grew from £173.2m in 
2014 to £191.8m (+11%) whilst gross profit 
improved from £67.6m to £82.3m (+22%). 
Adjusted EBITDA grew by 23% from 
£23.1m to £28.3m, while adjusted profit 
before tax increased to £21.0m, up 26% 
from £16.7m in 2014.
The outlook for Gamma continues to be 
positive, the product pipeline is strong,  
and we look forward to delivering 
sustainable long term value for our 
stakeholders. Our investment in  
developing new services continues.
Gamma operates primarily through a 
network of channel partners and this 
represents 79% of the revenue and 69% 
of profit from operations. Direct sales are 
increasingly focused on areas that the 
channel is less active in, such as large 
enterprise and the public sector.
Channel partners 
With our channel route to market showing 
growth in revenues of £15.1m to £152.0 in 
2015 (2014: £136.9m) and profit after tax  
of £13.8m in 2015 (2014: £6.1m), we have 
successfully met our three key objectives 
in this market of a) successfully growing our 
business with existing partners b) shifting 
the balance of revenues in favour of more 
strategic products, and c) expanding the 
number of partners that actively trade  
with us (from 725 to 834 during 2015).  
The channel remains a fast-changing  
and diverse market, with channel operators 
seeking to broaden their range of offerings 
to the UK business market. Unlike many of 
our competitors, the channel is our primary 
route to market and our focus is on helping 
our partners grow their businesses with a 
strong differentiated product set. During 
2015, we added significantly to the 
marketing expertise and services we 
provide to our partners, directly working 
with them to use the latest digital techniques 
to successfully drive new business. 
In the latter part of the year, we were 
particularly pleased to work successfully  
as a supplier to Fujitsu on the conversion  
of HMRC’s traditional ISDN telephony 
estate to SIP , as a part of a much wider 
transformation programme. With some 
97,000 numbers ported onto the Gamma 
network and 13,000 SIP trunks deployed, 
this was one of the largest and most 
complex ISDN to SIP conversions in 
the UK to date. We are pleased that it 
all transferred smoothly and on time.
Direct sales
The direct arm of Gamma’s business  
also showed strong growth with revenues 
rising to £39.8m (2014: £36.3m) and profit  
after tax of £4.5m (2014: £3.3m). This 
included wins such as a £3.5m, three year 
agreement with Taylor Wimpey plc for a 
managed communications infrastructure 
service. Gamma will take over the existing 
traditional fixed and mobile voice services 
to all Taylor Wimpey UK locations, and is  
in the process of migrating these services 
to Gamma’s Cloud-based unified 
communications service. 
Gamma was also selected by IT and 
business process services provider  
CGI Group Inc. to play a key part in the 
roll-out of smart meters across the UK  
by connecting energy firms to the core  
datacentres.
In the public sector, we were very pleased 
to be awarded a Government framework 
agreement on eight out of the ten possible 
‘Lots’ on the new Crown Commercial 
Service Network Services agreement 
(RM1045). This framework will replace 
a number of legacy agreements, and the 
‘Lots’ cover all communications services

including data, voice, mobile and integrated 
communications. This gives Gamma the 
ability to compete in a sector where we 
have been materially restricted in the past 
– particularly in competing for national 
government business. Our public sector 
team was successful in winning a number 
of new contracts including Peabody 
Housing Trust, and NHS Trusts such as 
North & East London, and Maidstone & 
Tunbridge Wells. 
Strategic products 
Our strategic products of SIP Trunking 
(business grade VoIP) and Horizon  
(our Cloud PBX service) have continued  
to grow strongly. 
Our SIP product – which is a more flexible 
and cost effective alternative to traditional 
ISDN – grew by 54%; from 234,000 to 
360,000 channels during 2015. We have 
continued to invest in our SIP product, 
maintaining our product leadership. 
We also introduced a number of service 
enhancements, including additional 
resiliency options and new pricing initiatives 
that bundle in calls to mobile destinations. 
Gamma remains the current UK market 
leader in SIP Trunking, and has exceeded 
significantly the general 25% market 
growth of SIP Channels in the UK 
(Ilume Report June 2015).
The market for cloud-based telephony 
services as an alternative to a traditional 
PBX is now well established. In 2015 the 
number of connected handsets on our  
own Cloud telephony product, Horizon, 
grew by 78% from 80,000 to 142,000, 
helped by the number of partners 
accredited to sell the product growing  
from 258 to 345. The product is  
subjected to a programme of continued 
enhancements, the most significant 
of which was the addition of call-centre 
functionality allowing any business that 
receives inbound calls to better manage, 
monitor and control their inbound call 
activity; from businesses with sales 
teams, help desks, accounts departments, 
receptionists or customer service 
representatives, right through to smaller 
professional call-centre environments.
For both SIP and Horizon, we are now 
seeing a growth in competition, from 
both UK based and overseas operators, 
however the market remains very buoyant, 
and in the past 12 months Gamma  
has outgrown significantly the general 
market growth.
Enabling products 
In June we were pleased to be able to 
launch on time our multi-site data network 
product (branded CPN – Converged 
Private Network). By the end of 2015, we 
have received eight orders for the product 
from larger organisations and the pipeline 
continues to grow. This product underpins 
our ability to provide full communications 
services for mid-market companies. 
Gamma’s enabling services of Ethernet, 
business-grade broadband, and mobile  
also grew significantly during the year. 
For example, the number of business-grade 
broadband connections grew from 29,000  
to 40,000 and Gamma’s Ethernet base 
expanded to 2,400 live connections.  
These services enable Gamma to  
provide converged voice and data  
services to businesses and extend its 
practice of providing more functionally 
bundled services.
Traditional products 
Margins on the traditional business, which 
we define as conventional wholesale calls 
and lines, have shown only a small decline 
(£0.3m of gross profit decline from 2014 to 
2015), ahead of the general and continuing 
reduction in the size of this market.

Operational performance 
With Gamma now providing services to  
a growing proportion of UK businesses, 
the quality of Gamma’s operational 
services remains absolutely paramount, 
and an area where the business seeks 
to differentiate itself from its competitors.
Overall, across all Gamma products, the 
2015 operational performance was above 
the defined and published service levels 
and the service level trend has been one  
of continuous improvement over several 
years. Strong emphasis continues to be 
placed on the quality of the operational 
service, the elimination of risk and 
improvements in security and, to this end 
the business has maintained its certification 
in both ISO 27001 and ISO 22301. 
During the year we have developed a 
number of online tools that allow partners 
to self-diagnose and rectify over 50% of 
faults; not only does this mean the partner 
can provide a better service to their 
customers, but it also means we can 
improve our own operational efficiency.
Cyber security
Over the last few years, the risk profile 
associated with cyber security has 
changed significantly, with several high 
profile cases hitting the press in 2015. 
Whilst no company can declare they  
are 100% immune from a cyber attack,  
our stringent governance in this area is 
independently audited and tested through 
both our ISO certifications and regular 
penetration testing. Alongside our ISO 
27001 certification, we also gained 
certification to the Cyber Essentials 
standard and we participate in the UK’s 
Cyber-security Information Sharing 
Partnership (CiSP), which is a joint 
industry-government initiative to share 
cyber threat and vulnerability information. 
The Board regularly reviews the health  
of our security governance, to ensure 
appropriate resource and priority is  
placed on mitigating risk in this area.
Chief Executive Officer’s review continued 13

Gamma Communications plc Annual Report and Accounts 2015
Regulatory
Gamma had been in commercial 
negotiations for a settlement in regard 
to its ladder pricing policy. I am pleased 
to report that we have now concluded 
a cash settlement and have recognised 
an exceptional gain of £5.7m for the year 
ending 31 December 2015.
Mobile services 
We announced last year that we had made 
an opportunistic, but strategic, acquisition 
of equipment that comprises the ‘core’ of 
a mobile network, i.e. the equipment which 
controls the voice and data services used 
by a mobile customer. 
I am pleased to report that progress on 
developing a full mobile service (including 
4G) has gone well and we are currently 
in full testing with plans for the service to 
go live in June 2016. Roaming and radio 
access agreements are in place and plans 
are advanced for the transfer of our existing 
base of some 66,000 customers on to the 
new full MVNO service. Gamma will look 
to position itself as the fourth mobile 
operator in the UK business market.
Looking forward, we recognise the 
importance of fixed-mobile integration,  
and Gamma is one of a very small number 
of operators with a strong capability in all 
the core technologies of fixed voice, mobile 
and data services. This is where we will 
be placing much of our development effort 
going forward. 
People and property
The average number of people in the 
Gamma Group increased over the year 
from 519 to 626, primarily to support the 
growth in product volume and future 
product development. 
Once again, Gamma was recognised 
as one of “The Sunday Times 100 Best 
Companies to Work For 2015” and retained 
its 2-star accreditation by Best Companies 
as an Outstanding Company. As well as 
aiding recruitment and retention, the survey 
process provides us with valuable and 
detailed feedback from our employees. 
To cater for the growth in the business, 
upon expiry of the lease for our Fareham 
office in December we relocated to 
improved premises in Port Solent (near 
Portsmouth). An additional floor of meeting 
space was also agreed opportunistically for 
our London office in the City, and our small 
Budapest office was relocated following the 
expiry of the lease. 
Outlook
And so to 2016, where our core strategy  
is to remain a leader in the high growth 
sectors of the business communications 
market (such as SIP Trunking and Cloud 
PBX), underpinned by absolutely the 
best-in-class quality of service and with the 
best and most motivated staff we can hire. 
We expect the volumes to continue to grow 
in new products (SIP Trunking, Cloud PBX 
etc) and to continue to decline in traditional 
services (phone calls and lines), with 
our margins continuing to migrate from 
traditional to strategic. 
The industry as a whole continues to 
undergo major changes, such as the 
acquisition of EE by BT, much of it driven 
by larger players looking to take multiple 
service offerings to the consumer market. 
Gamma, by contrast, remains wholly 
focused on the UK business market 
and the indirect channel is an effective 
route to that market. 
Bob Falconer 
Chief Executive Officer 14
This strategy will be principally 
pursued organically, but Gamma  
is also well placed to consider 
strategically relevant acquisitions  
as the opportunities arise.
Our objective
Gamma’s objective is to continue 
to grow both its market share 
and profitability by developing 
new innovative communications 
products for organisations.
Exploiting  
existing services
• Maintaining focus on  
the high-growth market 
opportunities for services 
such as SIP Trunking  
and Cloud PBX. 
•  Continuing to minimise 
the erosion of traditional 
services in spite of 
anticipated market size 
reductions by offering 
customers extra features 
and a migration path  
to strategic services 
and enabling services.
• Increasing flexibility of 
approach to increase 
share of end-customer 
wallet over time as 
multiple services 
procured from the 
same supplier and 
individual incumbent 
contracts expire.
Infrastructure 
investment
• We have an ongoing 
infrastructure investment 
programme in order 
to better position the 
business to supply more 
converged services and 
multi-site data services. 
• Reducing cost by 
expanding the data 
network deeper into  
the regulated BT 
Openreach exchanges.
Introducing new 
services
• Launched an MPLS  
data service in 2015 
to address the needs 
of larger multi-site 
organisations 
supported by a single 
set of IT systems and 
Gamma’s portal.
•  D e v e lop i n g mor e 
converged services  
and commercial bundles 
of services to meet 
the demand for such 
services in the UK 
business market.
• Seeking commercial 
opportunities to expand 
and deepen its technical 
capability in mobile 
services.
Developing the 
market
• Growing the number  
of channel partners 
that Gamma works 
with  and deepening 
the relationship with 
existing channel partners 
by providing attractive 
services and support.
•  Growing business in  
the public sector.
•  Growing Gamma’s brand 
awareness in the UK 
business market in 
support of the above.
Execution 
• Maintaining our “Policy  
of One” in terms of 
underlying systems.
Growing our 
profitability and 
market share

Development of core 
infrastructure for 
mobile network
During 2015 Gamma continued with the development of its  
‘mobile core’ (the central switching and intelligence which 
controls a mobile service). Ownership of this mobile core, 
together with Gamma’s existing fixed line network infrastructure 
and its software development capability, gives Gamma the  
ability to create new products tailored to the business market. 
The initial service will be ready for launch once all the relevant 
processes (e.g. number porting and international roaming)  
have been fully tested with the relevant operators, anticipated 
in the first half of 2016.

Risk Description Potential impact Mitigating actions Impact Change
Security
By its very nature, our network infrastructure provides customers with open access 
to the internet and global voice networks. As such there is a risk from cyber threat and 
telephony fraud as well as to the physical infrastructure. Over the last few years the 
profile around cyber security has changed significantly and the Company has adapted 
its governance accordingly.
A breach of security could have a significant impact 
on the Company’s reputation and, in the case of 
telephony fraud, there could also be the chance  
of commercial impact.
Gamma’s core infrastructure and operating capability is certified under ISO 27001 for 
security. We have a proactive approach to identifying any threat or attack and well proven 
procedures for neutralising such events.
We also employ external agencies to carry out penetration testing on our systems as well 
as carrying out our own security incident rehearsals. We have also undergone 
assessment and certification to meet the ‘Cyber Essentials’ standard.
In light of the increasing profile of cyber security we have enhanced our governance to 
ensure that we follow best practice in the identification and management of associated 
risk, including: increased frequency and broadened scope of both routine and bespoke 
penetration testing, mandated cyber security training for all our employees, dedicated 
security roles to track how cyber threats are evolving and are best detected, and Board 
visibility of the ‘health’ of the governance structure.
Our fraud management applications aim to identify unusual traffic patterns within a short 
space of time and we have a 24/7 operational capability to then assess and mitigate the risk.
High
Maintaining 
customer  
service levels
Communications services are critical to businesses. The ability to order and deliver 
them easily, and reach support quickly when something goes wrong, are key areas  
that any service provider is assessed on when a customer is placing business.
Delivering poor customer service has two potential 
impacts: firstly on our ability to sustain and grow 
revenues and secondly, dealing with failure increases 
the costs of the support operation.
We have a comprehensive service development plan that captures customer feedback  
and seeks to best align the support interfaces (system and human) with the needs of our 
customers. This programme delivers additional self-serve tools, online training material and 
specific customer service training for our support teams. Our objective is to eliminate any 
cause of frustration and ensure any interaction is as straightforward as possible.
In terms of governance, we hold a monthly quality forum chaired by the CEO that reviews 
performance across all parts of the business. This forum has its own action register to 
track through any improvements highlighted.
High
Network  
and systems 
performance
Reliable, high quality voice and data services are critical to any business and are  
the core components of Gamma’s products. Therefore, maintaining very high levels  
of service availability is central to any service provider’s credibility in this market.
If our network and systems perform below the market 
expectations then this will impact our ability to grow 
and sustain revenues.
We operate a comprehensive operational governance framework to manage the 
availability and performance of our services. This includes the design and architecture  
of our platforms, capacity planning, change management, security, business continuity 
planning and rehearsals, incident management and monitoring. This structure is subject 
to external audit via our ISO 27001, ISO 22301 and ND 1643 certifications.
High
Increased 
competition
New entrants or existing service providers extend their product set to compete directly 
with our products and services.
This may dilute the addressable market and slow 
down growth.
Gamma aims to provide services which are more attractive to our customers than those 
of competitors.
Moderate
Evolution  
of technology 
and markets
The communications market is constantly evolving both in terms of the available 
technologies and also in how people look to purchase certain products.
If the business does not at least keep pace with  
this evolving market then its plans for growth may  
be impacted.
Gamma plans, develops and markets products which match the evolution of market 
demand and of relevant technologies, and develops its core platforms to support  
these products.
Moderate
Suppliers
The business relies on a number of key suppliers to provide elements of its products 
and services.
Failure of one of these suppliers to perform may  
have an impact on our ability to deliver products  
and services.
Where possible, we avoid reliance upon a single supplier for a particular element of our 
service, and ensure key supplier contracts have appropriate clauses in place to assure 
their performance.
Moderate
Regulatory 
environment
The UK’s telecommunications sector does not have a “licence” requirement; it operates 
under a General Authorisation regime whereby, in combination with relevant UK and 
European statute, the sector’s regulator outlines the required compliance, which is 
presumed from telecommunications companies such as Gamma.
Our activities within the UK can also be impacted by the 
decisions of relevant legislative, regulatory and judicial 
bodies both domestically and in the European Union, 
with the primary potential impact of new decisions 
being changes to buy and sale prices for products  
and the way in which we are required to engage with 
our customers. Should our activities be found to be  
in breach of the requirements of our General 
Authorisation, the primary impact would be the cost  
of negative publicity and any financial penalty levied.
Gamma mitigates this risk by continuing to monitor likely regulatory changes; assessing 
their risk and potential impact; and engaging with regulators as appropriate.
Low
Key personnel
The business has grown rapidly over the last few years, with very low staff turnover. 
Therefore, there are individuals who have been instrumental in its development and  
are important to its ongoing success.
Loss of key individuals could have an impact on the 
continuing development of the business.
The business has a well-established team and a reputation for being a good employer.  
In 2015, it came 47th in ‘The Sunday Times Best 100 Companies To Work For’ ranking. 
This process involves a comprehensive staff survey, the feedback from which is actively 
reviewed and addressed by the senior management team.
Low
To this end, Gamma operates a robust  
and well established structure for the 
identification, evaluation, monitoring  
and mitigation of the potential risks to its 
performance. There is a comprehensive 
operational governance structure,  
with regular and documented meetings  
to track risks through the four stages  
on the opposite page. Each generic area  
of risk (e.g. Security) has clearly assigned 
accountability at Director level within the 
management team, with reporting lines  
to the CEO and ultimately the Board.
Gamma’s business is heavily reliant on the 
performance of its network and associated 
application platforms. It ensures that the 
network architecture and operational 
support processes are robust and can 
cope with the vast majority of failures 
without impacting customer service. 
Gamma holds certification to ISO 27001, 
22301 and ND 1643 which cover the 
security and business continuity of its 
primary products, as well as its core 
operational functions. In 2015 Gamma 
added the ‘Cyber Essentials’ standard to  
its list of certifications. Gamma carries out 
a full set of business continuity rehearsals, 
covering both technical failure and loss  
of access to physical locations.
The principal risks to the business are listed 
with a short description of their potential 
impact and what is being done to mitigate 
them. This is not an exhaustive list and,  
as described, the risk profile of the 
business is constantly evolving:

Gamma mitigates this risk by continuing to monitor likely regulatory changes; assessing 
their risk and potential impact; and engaging with regulators as appropriate.

Key personnel
The business has grown rapidly over the last few years, with very low staff turnover. 
Therefore, there are individuals who have been instrumental in its development and  
are important to its ongoing success.
Loss of key individuals could have an impact on the 
continuing development of the business.
The business has a well-established team and a reputation for being a good employer.  
In 2015, it came 47th in ‘The Sunday Times Best 100 Companies To Work For’ ranking. 
This process involves a comprehensive staff survey, the feedback from which is actively 
reviewed and addressed by the senior management team.

New customers  
through channel partners
The business unit has grown external 
revenues by 11% in 2015 with gross profit 
up 22% to £64m. The main drivers of profit 
growth have been a steady increase in 
number of partners and also the increased 
market penetration with our higher margin 
services SIP Trunking and Inbound. Our 
Cloud PBX, Horizon, has continued to be in 
demand, with 47% of our partners actively 
selling the service to their customers. 
The volume of these orders placed in 
2015 has grown by over 50%.
We have successfully launched our CPN 
data network offering – partners have 
contracted with customers including 
Weatherseal, Churchills and Toni & Guy.
Gamma grew the number of active 
partners from 725 to 834 during 2015. 
We have continued success in expanding 
our range of channel partners, having 
signed up more than 50% of the ‘Microsoft 
Gold’ partners to work with us, giving us 
more of a presence at the ‘Microsoft Gold’ 
forums. We also have 39% penetration of 
the Systems Integrators Top 100 CRN Rich 
List, and an ongoing campaign to target 
IT specialists. 
This diversity and breadth of the business 
models of new channel partners confirms 
the convergence of IT and telecoms, and 
our industry’s appetite to broaden service 
portfolios. To support the growth in 
partners, our sales team grew by 27% over 
the year. 24% of our sales team have been 
with Gamma for more than five years, with 
14% over ten years. There have been a few 
developments within the team – separating 
the systems integrator channel from value 
added resellers to make five channel 
teams. The ‘Carrier’ channel has expanded 
to cover cloud and infrastructure and now 
provides UK services to over 50 of the UK’s 
hosted telephony/Unified Communications 
as a Service (“UCaaS”) platforms. 
What we did in 2015
• Successfully launched our MPLS  
data product through the channel.
• Continued to grow the number of 
channel partners in emerging segments.
• Increased the level of business from 
Microsoft partners and systems 
integrators as a proportion of the whole.
• Increased cross sell ratios into the 
partner base.
Looking ahead in 2016, 
we plan to:
• Successfully launch our new  
mobile offering.
• Increase the level of business from 
mobile partners in the second half  
of the year.
• Continue to maintain cross sell  
ratios into the partner base.
• Encourage our partners with 
commercial deals which drive growth 
and commitment.
• Continue to grow the number of channel 
partners in emerging segments.

We have successfully sold our UK Carrier 
infrastructure as a service offering to 
Telstra, the Australian carrier, and have 
several other large international carriers 
interested in the service.
As ever, we have worked hard on deepening 
the relationship with our partners to ensure 
we are well connected right across their 
business and are supporting all relevant 
aspects of their operations. Over the year 
we ran sales training sessions, operational 
workshops to support our partners’ back 
office staff, and regular webinars on product 
market issues and important regulatory 
information. All of these activities combined 
to help generate a depth of relationship that 
hopefully puts Gamma at the core of our 
partners’ business; creating long term 
partnerships as opposed to short term 
transactional relationships.
Major partners during the year included 
companies such as Fujitsu, Freedom 
Communications, Olive, Capita IT, Daisy, 
Alternative, Azzurri, Focus, HighNet and 
Sabio. We continue to benefit from a broad 
spread of customers and low customer 
concentration. Our top ten partners 
accounted for 23% of total revenues 
at the end of 2015.
We have continued to develop our 
commercial frameworks with partners to 
build stronger, longer term and mutually 
beneficial relationships, increasing our 
visibility of forward revenues. The new 
Platinum Partner scheme has been 
introduced – select partners have been 
offered a ‘platinum’ contract, trading 
increased support for a longer term 
commitment to grow the volume of their 
SIP and/or Horizon products. In exchange 
they receive marketing assistance, a 
marketing fund and a dedicated line 
for any escalations.

New direct customers
Public sector
Our public sector business unit continues to 
evolve at speed with an enlarged customer 
base and a considerably enhanced position 
on key framework procurement processes. 
During 2015, we brought greater focus 
to this market, breaking public sector out 
as a distinct business unit to drive our 
capabilities and revenues forward.
Gamma had particular success with the  
key government procurement framework 
“Network Services RM1045”, gaining 
access to eight lots out of ten. We expect 
this to be a cornerstone of the public 
sector landscape for the next decade. 
The business also earned positions on the 
latest G-Cloud and JANET frameworks, 
while we continue to supply services 
through both Procurement for Housing 
and Scottish Government organisations.
Wins in 2015 included a £3.4m contract for 
Peabody Housing Trust to provide the Wide 
Area Network and Horizon hosted 
telephony to over 1,000 users. We also had 
several prominent SIP awards including 
NHS North and East London, Maidstone 
and Tunbridge Wells NHS Trust, with 
several more County Councils taking our 
services. Of the top 20 new business wins, 
19 included SIP Trunking services, 
cementing our position as market leader. 
Our churn was once again negligible with 
no losses from the major accounts team. 
Customers retained in the year include 
Northumberland County Council covering 
SIP , Inbound, ADSL, Ethernet and the 
conversion of the Cheshire Police ISDN 
estate to SIP .
We are rapidly expanding some of our 
product lines in order to meet customers’ 
requirements, recently adding a major PBX 
vendor to our capability with two more to 
complete in early 2016. The addition to 
these of Gamma’s own 4G Mobile services 
will significantly increase the ratio of 
tenders where we are able to meet 
requirements and bid competitively.
What we did in 2015
• Increased the average size of direct 
customers and new contracts.
• Built market share in the public sector  
by maximising opportunities from our 
framework contracts.
• Continued to have a CSAT Net 
Promoter Score above 20%.
• Pushed Cloud PBX and SIP Trunking 
harder into the mid-market. 
Looking ahead in 2016, 
we plan to:
• Continue to increase our average size  
of direct customers.
• Widen our service portfolio in the public 
sector to bid and win more tenders.
• Continue to have a CSAT Net Promoter 
Score above 20%.
• Successfully launch our new mobile 
offering into our direct businesses.
• Win more FTSE listed companies for 
managed service contracts.

We find that some customers,

or even insist on working directly 
with the network bearing operator. 
Some, such as the public sector, 
have very specific requirements 
that require a more tailored 
response. This is where our direct

Financial statements Corporate governance Strategic report
Gamma Communications plc Annual Report and Accounts 2015
Mid-market/SME sector 
In the Mid-market and SME sector it was 
apparent that 2015 saw a significant flip 
of sales from traditional telephony to Cloud 
PBX and SIP Trunking services. 
There have been very few new customers 
that have been won which have taken 
solely traditional voice services. Where this 
has been the case, the strategy has been 
to sign them up on the basis that they will 
employ next generation services once 
their estates have been placed under 
the Gamma umbrella and the project of 
migrating them onto a new service design 
(with IP telephony at its core) can begin.
Along with this notable shift, it has also now 
almost become the norm for customers 
to opt to bundle in their calls to their fixed 
rental/recurring charges. New customers 
such as Just Eat, Metro Bank and Money 
Supermarket.com have all opted for this 
model, which brings comfort over call 
spend and an easy to understand invoice. 
A dramatic increase in Cloud PBX sales 
has been in the main part driven by the 
SME channel, selling to the 10-100 seat 
business market. Clearly, this market is still 
being served in the main by BT. However, 
having the ability to sell Cloud PBX to this 
market, which means that the SME can 
enjoy the features and benefits plus the 
limited or even zero capital expenditure 
which only much larger organisations 
have traditionally enjoyed, is starting to 
grab the attention of this market segment.
The major accounts team are now
starting to really cement relationships with
our ~300 key accounts. Marsh & Parsons, 
Estée Lauder, Mills & Reeve, Haymarket 
Media, Keatons Estate Agents and 
Softcat, to name a few, all re-signed 
contracts in 2015.
Enterprise
It was another strong year for the Enterprise 
side of our business. This growth can be 
attributed to a combination of our Cloud 
unified voice, data and mobility solutions that 
are highly sought by Enterprise customers, 
combined with the fact that Gamma’s brand 
is rapidly becoming recognised as a trusted 
provider of communication services to 
medium and large enterprise organisations. 
It is to this end Gamma was awarded a three 
year managed communications services 
contract to provide the FTSE listed house 
builder Taylor Wimpey plc with a Cloud 
unified voice, data and mobility solution. 
We had additional big wins with NBC 
Universal, Americana International and 
Sinclair International Limited.
Our existing customers are very important 
and delivering them world class service is 
our aspiration. T o ensure our contract growth 
does not impact our current customers we 
bolstered our Enterprise support function, 
moving it to our centre of excellence in 
Manchester, where we were rewarded 
with an increase in organic growth from 
our existing managed service customers.
All direct contract awards are for next 
generation cloud services, where we help 
large organisations navigate the blurred line 
between fixed and mobile communications. 
This appeals to large organisations 
because they reduce the cost and 
complexity of owning and operating large 
communications estates with our flexible 
model, but still retain the confidence they 
are dealing with a network operator directly. 
This is why our direct Enterprise customers 
commit to multi-year service agreements, 
typically three or five years.
Customer service
Customer service continues to be at the 
heart of our proposition and we track our 
performance quarterly with CSAT surveys. 
We use the Net Promoter Score 
methodology as a method of quantifying 
and tracking our customers’ perceptions 
on service. Our average score for the year 
across four quarters of measurement was 
40.0% (up from 22.3% in 2014).

“ Gamma’s proposal met all the requirements, didn’t cost us a fortune 
which it would have done with other vendors, and we could lose ISDN

going to get such a personal service from anyone else.”

Adjusted EPS grew from 15.0p to 17 .9p.
Revenue
Indirect Business
Revenue from the indirect business grew 
from £136.9m to £152.0m and gross profit 
grew from £52.4m to £64.1m – an increase 
of £11.7m of gross profit year on year.
Unlike many of Gamma’s peers, the 
performance of the traditional business 
(which includes calls and lines and trade 
with other carriers) showed only a small 
decline in gross profit, down to £18.5m 
(2014: £18.8m). Revenues declined  
from £64.5m in 2014 to £58.2m as a 
consequence of reductions in the cost  
base, which were reflected in lower pricing 
(i.e. regulated cost base reductions can 
result in reduced prices to channel 
partners). Gamma continues to attract 
traditional business as a by-product from 
channel partners who chose to buy our 
new products such as Cloud PBX and SIP 
Trunking. The number of channel partners 
actively trading with Gamma increased 
from 725 at the start of the year to 834  
by the end of the year. 
The percentage of gross profit coming 
from channel partners who buy four or 
more products (excluding traditional calls 
and lines) from Gamma remains high at 
73% (2014: 72%). Both the increase in 
channel partners and the fact that they 
are selling more products meant that the 
revenue from new product sales increased 
from £72.4m to £93.8m and gross profit 
grew from £33.6m to £45.6m. Gross 
margin grew from 46.4% to 48.6%, which 
reflects the fact that the main contributor 
to this growth was SIP Trunking, which is 
our highest margin product. 
Direct Business
The direct business has also had a solid 
year although growth in the second half 
was lower than hoped for due to the length 
of the order to cash cycle. Revenue 
increased from £36.3m in 2014 to £39.8m 
and gross profit from £15.2m to £18.2m. 
Gross margin increased from 41.9% to 
45.7%. The growth was attributable to 
sales of new product and profit on these 
products grew from £10.6m to £14.0m. 
This includes multi-product solution sales 
to larger enterprises. This is particularly 
pleasing because much of the new 
business is won on multi-year contracts.
Operating expenses
Operating expenses before exceptional 
items and share based payments grew 
from £50.9m to £61.4m. This was due  
to a number of factors:
• The growth in the number of customers 
switching to new products for the first 
time continues to be a driver of overhead.
• The new mobile platform cost £1.8m 
to maintain in the year, which was cost 
incurred without any corresponding 
improvement in margins, which will 
come in the second half of 2016.
• We also continue to increase our 
investment in product development and, 
whilst internal spend of £0.9m was 
capitalised in the year, we spent more 
on the research and initial development 
of new product offerings and variants on 
our existing product set as we continue 
to build for the future.
• The Group continues to invest in its 
systems to ensure that, as sales 
increase, the number of customer service 
personnel required does not increase  
at the same rate.
Adjusted EBITDA
The combination of increasing sales of new 
products and operational improvements 
means that adjusted EBITDA grew from 
£23.1m to £28.3m or 23% – an impressive 
performance (adjusted EBITDA is stated 
before share based payments and 
exceptional Items).

+£6.7m
Adjusted cashflow from operating 
activities grew from £16.4m to 
£23.1m (cashflow has been adjusted 
downwards by £5.1m to reflect  
the non-recurring inflow from the 
“ladder pricing” settlement). 
Exceptional items and share  
based payments
In the current year there was an exceptional 
gain of £5.7m relating to “ladder pricing”.
Share based payment charges for the year 
were £4.1m in 2015 (2014: £3.2m) as a result 
of additional options being issued to senior 
management, a SIP scheme offered to all 
staff where Gamma matched shares bought 
by staff with one free matching share for 
each share purchased, and the increasing 
costs of Employers National Insurance on 
Share Option Gains. We anticipate share 
based payments decreasing in future years. 
Cash flows
The cash balance at the end of the year 
was £24.8m, which is up from £13.4m at 
the end of the previous year. 
The trading cash flows were bolstered by 
an exceptional inflow of £5.1m in respect 
of the ladder pricing settlement (some cash 
had been received previously but no income 
had been recognised in respect of this in 
the income statement due to an ongoing 
dispute). Therefore, whilst the cash flow 
from operations is shown as £28.2m, the 
underlying cash inflow is actually £23.1m. 
This adjustment gives a cash inflow before 
taxation of £25.3m which represents 89% 
of adjusted EBITDA for the year; in line with 
our historical rates of cash conversion.
Capital expenditure for the year was £11.5m, 
which is a decrease from £12.1m in the 
previous year . This is discussed in detail below.
The Group continues to be debt free and  
a number of lenders have indicated that 
they would be willing to support the Group 
with debt were it to be required for capital 
expenditure or an acquisition.
Capital expenditure
The Group spent £11.5m on capital, 
which was split as follows:
• £3.4m was on increasing capacity 
and development of the core network 
(2014: £4.8m).
• An additional £1.0m was spent on 
augmenting the mobile platform 
purchased in 2014 in preparation for  
a live service in 2016 (2014: £4.0m).
• £0.4m was spent on building out our  
data network into a number of London 
Exchanges which will reduce our cost 
base for our Ethernet product from  
mid-2016 (2014: £Nil).
• £0.9m was the capitalisation of 
development costs incurred during 
the year; this is in line with previous 
years (2014: £0.9m).
• £4.4m was on customer premises 
equipment (“CPE”); this is “success 
based” expenditure and is expected  
to increase in line with sales growth  
in our data and Cloud PBX products 
(2014: £1.0m).
• £1.4m of other assets which are 
predominantly related to IT and  
Fixtures and Fittings (2014: £1.4m).
Taxation
The effective tax rate for the year was 
19.0% (2014: 18.3%). The tax rate is lower 
than the statutory rate for the year (20.25%) 
because the Group benefits from research 
and development tax credits. These credits 
are however lower in 2015 than previously 
because the Group has moved into the 
large company regime where the credits 
are lower. 
Dividends
The Board has proposed a final dividend  
of 4.4p representing a full year dividend  
of 6.6p per share. This is an increase of 
11% against our pro-forma dividend for 
2014 of 5.93p and is in line with our 
progressive dividend policy. 
Subject to shareholder approval, the final 
dividend will be paid on 23 June 2016 
to shareholders on the register as at 
3 June 2016.

Flexible benefits
Gamma offers all UK based staff access 
to a pension scheme, life assurance cover 
and income protection. In response to staff 
feedback, Gamma offers a flexible benefits 
package which allows staff to trade salary 
for benefits such as a bike to work, gym 
membership, childcare vouchers and 
additional holiday. Gamma has also 
partnered with Reward Gateway to offer 
staff a variety of discounts from various 
retail outlets.
Apprenticeships
Gamma continues to welcome and assist 
apprentices to gain invaluable work 
experience, continue their education and 
gain nationally recognised qualifications. With 
apprentices currently employed in IT, 
Infrastructure Support, Software Development 
and Customer Service, we have a good track 
record of offering permanent employment at 
the end of the apprenticeships.
Chosen charity: Woodland Trust
We are proud to support the Woodland Trust, 
an organisation dedicated to the protection 
and promotion of natural woodlands 
across the UK.
Volunteering policy 
Gamma actively encourages and supports 
employees who wish to volunteer within 
the community or for charities. Supporting 
volunteers helps the Company to build 
relationships with the local community and 
improves its perception within it. Employees 
who do volunteering work can use the skills 
that they have developed at work to help 
in the community, or learn new skills, such 
as leadership, helping to improve their 
morale, physical health and overall  
work/life balance.
Policy on staff support for good causes
Gamma operates a policy of “matched 
funding” for all qualifying staff charity activities 
in addition to supporting the Woodland Trust. 
In 2015, we also ran two charity events with 
our customers – car rallying and cycling. 
The Charity Mountain Bike event raised 
£3,700 for the Samaritans and Rays of 
Sunshine whilst the Gammaball Rally raised 
a staggering £140,000 for Special Effects and 
ATE (Action Through Enterprise).
Share scheme
In addition to the long term incentive schemes 
which offer options to key employees, the 
Company is keen to ensure that all employees 
who would like to be shareholders can do 
so in the most efficient way. Therefore, the 
Company has historically offered a Share 
Incentive Plan (“SIP”) and, for 2016, will 
be offering a Save as you Earn (“SAYE”) 
scheme, both of which allow all eligible 
employees to acquire shares. At 31 December 
2015, 176 employees were shareholders 
via the SIP scheme.
Communicating with staff is obviously 
paramount in maintaining an involved and 
informed group of employees. We have 
quarterly conference calls where the 
management team individually brief the whole 
staff, supported by regular staff newsletters, 
CEO briefings (by location) and an annual 
survey (see Best Companies to Work For). 
Our staff churn across the business is low 
relative to industry norms, and particularly 
so in our customer service teams where 
knowledgeable, experienced staff are so 
vital to offering good customer service. 
Wherever we can, our preference is to grow 
our own staff from graduates or apprentices. 
In sales, for example, our strategy is to recruit 
graduates as desk-based support staff, 
developing them into field-based sales and 
ultimately sales management. The average 
tenure of our sales staff is well over five years, 
with many of our sales management having 
been with us for over ten years.
The business also offers staff a choice in 
terms of flexible benefits. We believe this 
flexibility gives our employees freedom and 
choice in selecting a customised basket of 
benefits to suit their specific needs and 
individual lifestyle. We also aim to provide 
a degree of peace of mind for our people 
through the provision of income protection and 
life assurance policies. For those employees 
juggling work, family or carer commitments, 
or trying to enhance their work/life balance, 
we provide the option for them to purchase 
additional holidays.
Staff learning and development remains 
a key priority for Gamma. It helps us to 
maximise the potential of our people, 
retain skills and grow the business. As a 
technically-based business in a fast-changing 
market we need to keep our people’s skills up 
to date and give them the opportunity to grow 
and develop as best they can. A wide range of 
learning and development opportunities are 
available, including funding by Gamma to 
undertake Masters level courses and other 
professional development courses.
Corporate social responsibility
An engaging 
culture, central  
to our business 
growth and ideals
Our culture has been instrumental  
in the growth and success of the 
business to date. This is aided by 
trusting our staff, delegating as far 
as possible, and creating an informal, 
constructive environment.
The environment and CarbonNeutral®
We made a commitment to reducing our 
carbon footprint across our network back in 
2006, through investment in the efficiency 
of our IP based network and other assets 
as well as an active offset management 
programme. This means Gamma is a fully 
certified CarbonNeutral
® 
company, making us 
one of the few communications providers in 
the UK to have a net zero carbon footprint. 29

Richard Bligh was appointed as a Director of the Company on

During 2015, certain Directors who were not committee members 
attended meetings of the Audit Committee and Remuneration 
Committee by invitation. These details have not been included 
in the table. Where a Director is unable to attend meetings of the 
Board or of Board committees, such Director is invited to review 
the relevant papers for the meetings and provide his comments to 
the Board or the Board committees in advance of such meetings.
The workings of the Board and its Committees
At 31 December 2015, the Board was comprised of five Non-
Executive Directors, one of whom is the Chairman, and three 
Executive Directors. Of the Non-Executive Directors, three  
are considered to be independent. The Board is responsible to  
the Shareholders for the proper management of the Group. It 
meets regularly, as set down in the table opposite, to review trading 
performance, set and monitor strategy, examine acquisition and 
divestment possibilities, approve major capital expenditure projects 
and other significant financing matters and report to shareholders. 
The Board delegates authority to the management for the 
day-to-day business under a set of delegated authorities which 
cover: routine operational matters, purchasing procedures, 
financial authority limits, contract approval procedures and  
the hiring of full time and temporary staff and consultants. 
Matters for review by the Board are communicated in advance  
of formal meetings. All of the Directors are subject to election by 
shareholders at the first AGM after their appointment to the Board 
and to re-election by shareholders at least once every three years. 
In addition, any Non-Executive Director who has served on the 
Board for more than nine years will be subject to annual re-election.
The Chairman and Non-Executive Directors have other third 
party commitments including directorships of other companies. 
The Company is satisfied that these associated commitments 
have no measurable impact on their ability to discharge their 
responsibilities effectively. The Executive Directors have no third 
party commitments.
New Directors receive induction on their appointment to the Board 
which covers the activities of the Group and its key business  
and financial risks, the terms of reference of the Board, and its 
committees, and the latest financial information about the Group.

and diverse workforce, to ensure that all selection decisions are 
based on merit and that all recruitment activities are fair and 
non-discriminatory. We continue to focus on encouraging diversity 
of business skills and experience, recognising that Directors and 
managers with diverse skills sets, capabilities and experience 
gained from different backgrounds enhance the Group. 
Relations with shareholders
Communication with shareholders is given high priority by  
the Board and is undertaken through press releases, general 
presentations at the time of the release of the annual and interim 
results and face-to-face meetings. The Group issues its results 
promptly to individual shareholders and also publishes the same 
on the Company’s website. Regular updates to record news 
in relation to the Company are also included on the website.
In order to ensure that the members of the Board develop an 
understanding of the views and concerns of major shareholders 
there is regular dialogue with institutional shareholders, including 
meetings after the announcement of the Company’s annual and 
interim results. The Board uses the AGM to communicate with 
private and institutional investors and welcomes their participation.

 → considers whether these statements and announcements 
provide a balanced and understandable view of Gamma’s 
strategy and performance, and of the associated risks;
 → considers the appropriateness of accounting policies and 
significant accounting judgements and the disclosure of these 
in the financial statements;
 → reviews the effectiveness of financial controls and systems.  
In this context the Committee continues to keep under review 
the need for an internal audit function; and
 → oversees the relationship with and performance of the  
external auditors.
Activities of the Committee during the year
In fulfilment of the responsibilities set out above, the Committee’s 
activities have focused on financial reporting and the related 
statutory audit, and the assessment of internal controls. In addition, 
the Committee conducted a tender for the external audit, which is 
also explained below.
Financial reporting and statutory audit
The Committee has reviewed with both management and the 
external auditors the half year and annual financial statements, 
focusing on:
 → the overall truth and fairness of the results and financial 
position, including the clarity of disclosures shown in the 
statements and their compliance with statutory, listing and  
best practice requirements;
 → the appropriateness of the accounting policies and practices 
used in arriving at those results;
 → the resolution of significant accounting judgements or of 
matters raised by the external auditors during the course  
of their half year review or annual statutory audit; and
 → the quality of the Annual Report taken as a whole, including 
disclosures on governance, strategy, risks and remuneration, 
and whether it gives a fair and balanced picture of the Group.
External audit
The Committee discussed, challenged and agreed with Deloitte LLP 
their detailed audit plans prepared in advance of the audit, which set 
out their assessment of key audit risks and materiality. There were 
particular discussions on the complexity of auditing revenues and 
associated costs and the use of specialist audit techniques for 
Gamma’s billing and related IT systems. To help with these 
discussions, the Billing and Revenue Assurance Manager 
presented to the Committee on what Gamma itself does on a daily 
basis to ensure the accuracy of billings to clients and that Gamma 
only pays for the proper amount of any corresponding external cost. 
The Committee satisfied itself that the appropriate degree of audit 
rigour and scepticism would be applied in this crucial area.
Accounting policies, practices and judgements
The selection of appropriate accounting policies and practices is 
the responsibility of management, and the Committee discussed 
these with both management and the external auditors.  
Audit Committee  
report
Corporate governance
The Committee consists of the three Independent Non-Executive 
Directors, including the Chairman of the Board, who between them 
have a balance of recent and relevant financial experience and 
accounting training, and general business knowledge. There were 
no changes to the membership of the Committee during the year.
The Committee meets at least three times a year generally just 
prior to Board meetings to facilitate immediate and efficient 
reporting to the Board, with additional meetings where necessary. 
The external auditors are invited to each meeting. The Chief 
Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer and the other Non-
Executive Directors also attend by invitation.
The Committee also meets separately with the external auditors 
without others being present, and the Chairman of the Committee 
maintains a regular dialogue with the Chief Financial Officer and 
his team. 
Objectives and responsibilities
The Committee’s key objectives are to provide effective 
governance over Gamma’s financial reporting and the 
performance of the external auditors; to provide oversight of  
the Group’s systems of internal financial control; and to report  
to the Board on these matters.
In fulfilment of these objectives the Committee:
 → reviews Gamma’s financial statements and announcements, 
including compliance with statutory and listing requirements. 
As an AIM-listed company, Gamma is not required fully to 
comply with the UK Corporate Governance Code, but seeks 
nevertheless to comply in all material respects; 39

Gamma Communications plc Annual Report and Accounts 2015
Significant areas considered by the Committee in relation to the 
2015 financial statements are set out below.
 → Revenue recognition. Gamma has a number of revenue 
streams arising from its various products and services which 
should be recognised in line with relevant contractual terms.
As discussed earlier in this report, the Committee’s 
consideration of this area took into account the extensive work 
carried out by Gamma’s Revenue Assurance function on the 
integrity of amounts billed and charges received and the audit 
work on the relevant systems carried out by Deloitte.
 → Exceptional items. These should be disclosed, fully described 
in the notes to the accounts and taken into consideration for 
year on year comparisons, including the calculation of EPS.
The Committee considered the quantum and disclosure of 
relevant amounts.
 → Capitalisation of internal development costs. Gamma carries 
out a significant level of in-house development which is 
capitalised and amortised where appropriate – that is, where 
projects are technically feasible, can be completed and  
the asset can or will be capable of use or sale.
The Committee considers management’s capitalisation 
process and the assumptions used when assessing whether 
expenditure should be capitalised or otherwise.
 → Impairment of goodwill. In accordance with accounting 
standards, Gamma is required to test annually whether 
goodwill has suffered any impairment.
The Committee reviews the impairment testing carried out, 
including estimates of future cash flows (the achievability of  
the long term business plan) and the choice of discount rate.
 → Share based payments. The charge in the financial statements 
for share based payments can be complex, often involving 
estimates around market volatility and yield.
The Committee reviewed the calculations prepared by 
Gamma’s external advisers in this area, calculations by 
management, the assumptions relating to performance 
conditions and the findings of the external auditors.
 → Leasehold dilapidations. Provisions for leasehold dilapidations 
are estimates of the cost of returning leasehold properties to  
a defined condition at the end of the lease.
The Committee has satisfied itself as to the basis of the 
estimates made, particularly the costs to be incurred at the  
end of each lease.
 → Taxation. The Group recognises tax liabilities based on its 
assessment of the supportability of its tax return positions. 
The Committee considered the estimates involved in arriving  
at the provision for taxation, in particular where there is any 
possibility of challenge upon review by the tax authorities.
Assessment of internal financial control
Management is responsible for putting in place internal financial 
controls over financial reporting and to protect the business from 
identified material risks.
As reported last year, extensive due diligence was carried out in 
2014 on the Group’s financial controls as part of the IPO process. 
Those controls were also reviewed by the external auditors as part 
of the statutory audit. With the change in auditors for 2015 the 
financial controls have had another fresh review and the external 
auditors have reported their findings to the Audit Committee. The 
Committee has also, as described above, received a presentation 
from Gamma’s Revenue Assurance team on the systems and 
procedures surrounding revenue and associated costs.
Given the level of controls in place, the Committee is satisfied 
at present that no internal audit establishment is required. 
The Committee will, however, continue to keep this under review.
Audit tender process
Following the conclusion of the statutory audit of the 2014 financial 
statements, the Board, on the Committee’s recommendation, 
considered that it was appropriate to put the audit for the 2015 
financial year out to tender. The previous auditors, Grant Thornton 
LLP , were not invited to take part in this process, having already 
served as Gamma’s auditors for over ten years.
The tender process and the Committee’s involvement are set out below.
 → visits by the Chairman of the Audit Committee and the Chief 
Financial Officer to the local offices of major audit practices  
to assess their interest in tendering for the audit;
 → provision of ‘data room’ materials to those tendering;
 → presentation of the Group by management to all firms tendering;
 → meetings of those firms with members of the finance team and 
the Chairman of the Audit Committee;
 → submission of written proposals outlining the audit team, 
audit approach, proposed transition arrangements and issues, 
independence considerations and proposed fees;
 → oral presentation by key members of proposed audit teams  
to a panel comprised of the Audit Committee and the Chief 
Financial Officer;
 → evaluation of the firms taking into account feedback from each 
stage of the tender process; and
 → recommendation to the Board.
As a result of this process, the Audit Committee proposed and it 
was unanimously resolved by the Board to appoint Deloitte LLP  
as Gamma’s auditors for the 2015 audit, including the review of 
the half year results.
External audit effectiveness
Following the publishing of the 2015 financial statements, the  
Audit Committee will be carrying out an assessment of the external 
auditors and the external audit process. The outcome will be 
reported in the 2016 Annual Report.

Dear Shareholders
I am pleased to introduce the Director’s Remuneration Report for 
the 2015 financial year. The Chairman’s statement (on pages 6 to 
7) provides a summary of the progress the Group has made over 
the year. The Remuneration Committee is committed to structuring 
senior executive remuneration that is competitive, incentivises  
and rewards good performance, and that will help the Company  
to continue building on this strong performance, thereby creating 
value for shareholders. The Remuneration Committee is  
appointed by the Board, and comprises the three Independent 
Non-Executive Directors. 
The Committee is primarily responsible for determining and 
agreeing with the Board the broad policy for the remuneration  
and employment terms of the Executive Directors, Chairman and 
other senior executives and, in consultation with the CEO, for 
determining the total individual remuneration packages of senior 
executive managers. The Committee is also responsible for the 
review of, and making recommendations to the Board in 
connection with share incentive plans, and performance related 
pay schemes and their associated targets, and for the oversight  
of employee benefit structures across the Group. The Committee’s 
full terms of reference are reviewed regularly and approved by the 
Board. No Director or manager is involved in any decisions as to 
their own remuneration.
Short term performance for senior executives is incentivised using 
an annual bonus scheme based on the achievement of profitability. 
Long term performance is incentivised by way of a long term 
incentive plan (LTIP) based on the achievement of Total 
Shareholder Return (TSR) and Earnings Per Share (EPS)  
growth goals, over a three year measurement period. 
In order to further facilitate the alignment of employee and 
shareholder interests, prior to its admission to AIM, the Group also 
adopted a Group-wide general Share Incentive Plan (SIP) and a 
Company Share Option Plan (CSOP). 
Under the SIP , awards of 256,320 free shares were made to all 
employees in October 2014. In March 2015, employees purchased 
98,501 partnership shares under the SIP , which were matched 1:1 
by the Company. In May 2015, employees indicated their intention 
to purchase 121,353 partnership shares under the SIP , which will 
be matched 1:1 by the Company. 
The CSOP is designed to enable the Group to selectively incentivise 
key high performing employees. In May 2015, 370,349 awards of 
options were made to high performing employees under the CSOP . 
In 2016, it is planned to introduce a new Company wide SAYE share 
save scheme. These various schemes provide the Board with the 
tools to help the alignment of employee and shareholder interests.
Employees in the Group generally participate in a bonus scheme 
that enables them to earn up to 10% of basic salary based half  
on personal performance and half on Company performance. 
Furthermore, based on the Company’s performance in 2015,  
and the contribution and hard work of all the employees, the 
Board was pleased to approve a 2% general salary increase  
at the 2015 year end.

This Remuneration Committee report includes a summary of the remuneration policy, details of Directors’ Service Agreements as well 
as the Annual Report on Remuneration. 
 
As an AIM-listed company, this report is not mandatory, but is included as a matter of best practice. Gamma’s Remuneration Committee 
report was approved unanimously on an advisory basis at the 2015 AGM and we are not proposing any material policy changes for the 
current financial year. This Remuneration Committee report will again be put to an advisory vote at the forthcoming 2016 AGM.

Directors’ remuneration policy
This part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report sets out the remuneration policy of the Company with regard to its Directors. 
Policy on Executive Director remuneration
The Company’s remuneration policy is designed to ensure that the Company is able to attract, retain and motivate executives and senior 
management of the right quality to enable the Company to fulfil its objectives and longer term potential. The retention of key management 
and the alignment of management incentives with the creation of shareholder value are a key objective of this policy.
Setting base salary levels for Executive Directors at an appropriate level is key to management retention. Therefore, the Remuneration 
Committee seeks to ensure that salaries are market competitive for comparable companies. The aim is to set total compensation within 
a range around the median level for the Company’s peer group.
The Remuneration Committee is directly responsible for setting the remuneration of Executive Directors and for giving guidance on and 
approving recommendations for the remuneration of other members of the senior management team.
The main components of the remuneration policy for the year ending 31 December 2016 and how they are linked to and support the 
Company’s business strategy are summarised below:
Purpose and link to strategy Operation Potential remuneration Performance metrics
Base salary
To be set at a level which is 
sufficiently competitive to recruit 
and retain individuals of the 
appropriate calibre to deliver the 
Company’s strategy, and which 
takes into account the Director’s 
experience and personal 
contribution to the Company’s 
strategy.
Salaries are typically reviewed 
annually, with any changes 
effective from 1 January. The 
review takes into account:
•  C o m pan y p e r fo r m anc e ; 
•  the role, experience and 
performance of the individual 
Director; and
•  average workforce salary 
adjustments within the Company.
Salaries are benchmarked from 
time to time against comparable 
roles at companies of a similar size 
and complexity in the Telecoms 
and IT services sectors.
The CEO’s base salary was 
reviewed on 1 January 2016  
(the prior review being in October 
2014) and was increased by 2%  
to £299,880. 
The CFO’s salary was reviewed on 
1 January 2016 and increased by 
2% to £183,600. The prior review 
was in June 2015 at the time of his 
promotion to CFO.
The COO was appointed to this 
position on 1 December 2015.  
His salary is £200,000 with effect 
from 1 January 2016.
Not applicable.
Benefits
To complement basic salary by 
providing market competitive 
benefits to attract and retain 
executives.
Reviewed from time to time to ensure 
that benefits when taken together 
with other elements of remuneration 
remain market competitive.
Benefits for the Executive Directors 
currently comprise participation in 
the Company’s life assurance and 
income protection schemes. 
The cost of providing these benefits 
vary year on year depending on  
the schemes’ premiums. The 
Remuneration Committee monitors 
the overall cost of the benefits 
package.
Not applicable. 42
Remuneration Committee report

Corporate governance
Purpose and link to strategy Operation Potential remuneration Performance metrics
Pension
To provide retirement benefits, 
which when taken together  
with other elements of the 
remuneration package, will 
enable the Company to attract 
and retain executives.
The Executive Directors (together 
with all other eligible staff) are able 
to participate in the Company’s 
defined contribution (money 
purchase) pension scheme.  
The Company contributes a 
maximum of 5.1% of salary.
A contribution of up to 5.1% per 
annum of salary is paid into the 
scheme, by the Company, on 
behalf of the COO and CFO. The 
COO and CFO are able to request 
that the Company, at the discretion 
of the Remuneration Committee, 
makes additional contributions 
where salary or bonus has been 
waived. The CEO does not 
participate in the scheme.
Not applicable.
Annual bonus
To incentivise the achievement 
of the Company’s annual 
financial targets.
The Executive Directors (as well  
as the other senior executive 
managers) participate in a 
discretionary, annual, performance 
related bonus scheme. Targets are 
set at the beginning of each year 
based on the recommendations  
of the Remuneration Committee. 
Bonuses are paid in cash based  
on audited financial results.
For the Executive Directors, the 
maximum capped bonus potential 
is 100% of salary.
For 2015, the Executive Directors 
achieved the maximum capped 
bonus of 100% of salary.
For the year ending 2015, the 
targets were based on growth in 
Adjusted Profit Before Tax (PBT).
For 2016, targets are again based 
on growth in Adjusted Profit Before 
Tax (PBT).
Long Term Incentive Plan 
(LTIP)
To motivate executives and 
incentivise the achievement 
of longer term financial 
performance. 
To align the interests of 
executives and shareholders.
The Executive Directors (as well as 
other senior executive managers) 
participate in a discretionary LTIP.
The plan entitles participants to an 
allocation of, or options over, free 
(or nominal value) shares after a 
performance period of three years, 
subject to certain performance and 
service conditions being met. 
Participation is at the discretion  
of the Remuneration Committee.
Awards will typically be made 
annually based on a multiple  
of annual salary. Performance 
conditions are set by the 
Remuneration Committee at the 
time of the award. The plan rules 
amongst other things include 
claw-back provisions and a 
limitation to ensure that new  
shares issued, when aggregated 
with all other employee share 
awards, must not exceed 10% 
of issued share capital over any  
ten year period.
The Remuneration Committee 
would in normal circumstances 
expect to make annual LTIP awards 
to the Executive Directors (and 
other senior executive managers) 
at a value of 100% of base salary.
Following the announcement of the 
Group’s results for 2014, awards 
were granted under this scheme 
at a value of 100% of base salary. 
These awards will vest in April 
2018, subject to service and 
performance conditions.
It is anticipated that further awards 
will be made in April 2016 following 
announcement of the Group’s 
annual results.
Vesting of the LTIP awards is 
conditional upon the following 
performance conditions:
15% of the shares if annual 
compound total shareholder return 
(TSR) over the performance period 
equals 8%, and 50% of the shares 
if annual compound TSR over the 
performance period equals 15%  
or higher, with straight line vesting  
in between.
15% of the shares if annual 
compound growth of adjusted 
earnings per share (adjusted  
for exceptional costs and share 
based payment costs) over the 
performance period equals 8%, 
and 50% of the shares if annual 
compound growth of adjusted  
EPS over the performance  
period equals 20% or higher, with 
straight line vesting in between. 
In both cases (TSR and EPS) the 
Committee determined that at this 
stage of Gamma’s development 
and its market position, absolute 
performance measures would be 
more appropriate than relative 
measures. 43

Gamma Communications plc Annual Report and Accounts 2015
Alignment of executive remuneration and the market
In 2014, ahead of the IPO, the Company engaged h2glenfern, a remuneration advisory practice, to undertake a benchmarking exercise  
for use in considering the remuneration levels of the Executive Directors as well providing advice on longer term incentive plan structures. 
In undertaking this work h2glenfern took into account Gamma’s size, position, profile and outlook, and reviewed the remuneration data 
for a number of comparable UK quoted telecoms/technology companies. It is planned that a similar benchmarking exercise will be 
undertaken every three years.
In addition to such formal benchmarking exercises, the Committee takes advantage of various annual AIM Directors’ Remuneration 
reports as well as available data about similar and competing companies. The Company aims to position Gamma Directors’ salary and 
annual bonus at the median level, but to also ensure there is significant incentive and reward for better than average longer term results 
through the performance based Long Term Incentive Plan.
Consideration of employment conditions elsewhere in the Group
The Committee considers the pay and conditions of employees throughout the Company when determining the remuneration 
arrangements for Executive Directors although no direct comparison metrics are applied. In particular, the Committee considers the 
relationship between general changes to UK employees’ remuneration and Executive Director reward. Whilst the Committee does  
not directly consult with our employees as part of the process of determining executive pay, the Board does receive feedback from 
employee surveys that takes into account remuneration in general. The Committee also receives updates from the Head of Group HR.
Policy on Non-Executive Director remuneration
The Chairman and the other Non-Executive Directors’ remuneration comprises only fees. The Chairman’s fee is approved by the  
Board on the recommendation of the Remuneration Committee. The other Non-Executives’ fees are approved by the Board on the 
recommendation of the Chairman and CEO. The Non-Executive Directors are not involved in any decisions about their own remuneration.
Additional fees over and above the base fee are payable to the chairmen of the Audit and Remuneration Committees. They are reviewed 
annually with changes effective from 1 January each year. The Chairman and the other Independent Non-Executive Directors are 
entitled to be reimbursed for reasonable expenses.
Details of the fees paid for 2015 are set out in the Annual Report on Remuneration. There were no changes to the general Non-Executive 
Director fees at the start of 2016, however the Committee Chair fees for the chairs of the Remuneration and Audit Committees were 
increased by £1,000 each with effect from 1 January 2016. 
The current fees are as follows: 
Director Directors’ Fee Committee Chair Fee 2016
Richard Last £75,000 – £75,000
Alan Gibbins £35,000 £6,000 £41,000

Remuneration Committee Chairman 48
The Directors present their Annual Report 
on the affairs of the Group, together with 
the financial statements for the year ended 
31 December 2015.
An indication of likely future developments in the business of the 
Company and details of research and development activities are 
included in the strategic report.
Information about the use of financial instruments by the Company 
and its subsidiaries is given in note 18 to the financial statements. 
Dividends
The Directors recommend a final dividend of 4.4p (2014: 3.95p) 
per Ordinary Share to be paid on 23 June 2016 to ordinary 
Shareholders on the register on 2 June 2016. An interim dividend 
of 2.2p (2015: £Nil) per Ordinary Share was paid on 23 October 
2015 to all shareholders on the register at 25 September 2015. 
Directors
The names and biographies of the Directors during the year are 
disclosed on pages 32 to 33. 
Share capital and share options
Details of the share capital of the Company and options over 
shares of the Company are set out in notes 21 and 25 to the Group 
financial statements. Over the period, the Company had three 
share incentive schemes by which Directors and employees may: 
(i) be granted options under a long term incentive scheme to 
subscribe for nil cost shares in the Company, (ii) be issued shares 
under the Company Share Option Plan, and (iii) be issued shares 
under a Share Incentive Plan.
The maximum aggregate number of shares which may be  
issued in respect of these schemes is limited to 10% of the  
issued share capital. 
Composition of the Group
Details concerning subsidiary undertakings are given in note 13  
to the Group financial statements. 
Directors’ interest in share capital
The Directors’ interest in share capital is shown within the 
Remuneration Report.
Directors’ indemnities
The Company has made qualifying third party indemnity provisions 
for the benefits of its Directors which were made during the course 
of the year and remain in force at the date of this report. 
Going concern
The Group’s business activities, together with the factors likely 
to affect the future development, performance and position, 
are set out in the strategic report. The financial position of the 
Group,  its cash flows, liquidity position and borrowing facilities are 
described in the Finance Review section in the strategic report and 
in note 18. Further information on the Group’s exposure to financial 
risks and the management thereof is provided in note 18. 
The Board’s review of the accounts, budgets and financial plan 
leads the Directors to believe that the Group has sufficient 
resources to continue in operation for the foreseeable future.
The financial accounts are therefore prepared on a going  
concern basis.

Treasury policy
The objective of the Group’s treasury policy is to manage the 
Group’s financial risk and to minimise the adverse effects of 
fluctuations in the financial markets on the value of the Group’s 
financial assets and liabilities, on reported profitability and on the 
cash flows of the Group. Note 18 sets out the particular risks to 
which the Group is exposed, and how these are managed.
Interests in contracts
There have been no contracts or arrangements during the financial 
year in which a Director of the Company was materially interested 
and which were significant in relation to the Group’s business.
Health, safety, the environment and the community
The Group has a formal Health, Safety and Environmental 
Policy which requires all operations within the Group to pursue 
economic development whilst protecting the environment. 
The Directors aim not to damage the environment of the areas 
in which the Group operates, to meet all relevant regulatory and 
legislative requirements and to apply responsible standards of 
its own where relevant laws and regulations do not exist.
It is the policy of the Group to consider the health and welfare  
of employees by maintaining a safe place and system of work  
as required by legislation in each of the countries where the  
Group operates.
Political donations
No political donations were made in the year. 
Employee consultation
Gamma recognises the essential importance of employees to the 
success of the business and ensures that they are fully informed  
of events that directly affect them and their working conditions. 
Information on matters of concern to employees is given in 
briefings that seek to provide a common awareness on the part 
of all employees of the financial and economic factors affecting 
the Group’s performance.
During both the year and the prior year Gamma undertook 
the Best Companies Limited employee engagement survey 
and achieved a 2-star accreditation. The results from this survey 
attracted a listing in the Sunday Times Best 100 Companies 
to Work For and Gamma was placed in the top 50 companies 
in the UK.
Disabled employees
Applications for employment by disabled persons are given full  
and fair consideration for all vacancies in accordance with their 
particular aptitudes and abilities. It is the policy of the Company 
that training and promotion opportunities should be available 
to all employees. 
Auditors and their independence
A resolution to appoint auditors for the year to 31 December 2016 
will be proposed at the AGM. The Company has a policy for 
approval by the Audit Committee of non-audit services by the 
Auditor, to preserve independence. 
Disclosure of information to auditors
The Directors who held office at the date of approval of this 
Directors’ report confirm that, so far as they are each aware, there 
is no relevant audit information of which the Company’s auditor is 
unaware; and each Director has taken all the steps that he ought  
to have taken as a Director to make himself aware of any relevant 
audit information and to establish that the Company’s auditor is 
aware of that information. This confirmation is given and should 
be interpreted in accordance with the provisions of s418 of the 
Companies Act 2006.
By order of the Board:
Andrew Belshaw
Chief Financial Officer
21 March 2016 50
The Directors are responsible for preparing 
the Annual Report and the financial 
statements in accordance with applicable 
law and regulations.
Company law requires the Directors to prepare such financial 
statements for each financial year. Under that law the Directors are 
required to prepare the Group financial statements in accordance 
with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as 
adopted by the European Union and Article 4 of the IAS 
Regulation and have also chosen to prepare the parent company 
financial statements in accordance with Financial Reporting 
Standard 101 ‘Reduced Disclosure Framework’.
Under company law, the Directors must not approve the financial 
statements unless they are satisfied that they give a true and fair 
view of the state of affairs and profit or loss of the Company for 
that period. In preparing these financial statements, the Directors 
are required to: 
 → select suitable accounting policies and then apply  
them consistently;
 → make judgements and estimates that are reasonable  
and prudent;
 → state whether applicable UK Accounting Standards have  
been followed, subject to any material departures disclosed 
and explained in the financial statements; and
 → prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis 
unless it is inappropriate to presume that the Company will 
continue in business.
The Directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting 
records that are sufficient to show and explain the Company’s 
transactions and disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time  
the financial position of the Company and enable them to ensure 
that the financial statements comply with the Companies Act 2006. 
They are also responsible for safeguarding the assets of the 
Company and hence for taking reasonable steps for the prevention 
and detection of fraud and other irregularities.
In so far as each of the Directors is aware:
 → there is no relevant audit information of which the Company’s 
auditors are unaware; and
 → the Directors have taken all steps that they ought to have taken 
to make themselves aware of any relevant audit information 
and to establish that the Auditors are aware of that information. 
The Directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity of 
the corporate and financial information included on the Company’s 
website. Legislation in the United Kingdom governing the 
preparation and dissemination of the financial statements may 
differ from legislation in other jurisdictions.
Auditor
During the year, Grant Thornton UK LLP resigned as auditors of 
the Company. Deloitte LLP were appointed by the Directors to fill 
the casual vacancy arising and will be proposed for reappointment 
in accordance with section 485 of the Companies Act 2006.

Gamma Communications plc Annual Report and Accounts 2015
We have audited the financial statements 
of Gamma Communications plc for the 
year ended 31 December 2015 which 
comprise the Consolidated Statement of 
Comprehensive Income, the Consolidated 
Statement of Financial Position, the 
Consolidated Statement of Cashflows, 
the Consolidated Statement of Changes 
in Equity, the Company Balance Sheet, the 
Company Statement of Changes in Equity, 
and the Group and Company related notes 1 
to 29 and 1 to 9 respectively. The financial 
reporting framework that has been applied 
in the preparation of the Group financial 
statements is applicable law and 
International Financial Reporting Standards 
(IFRSs) as adopted by the European Union. 
The financial reporting framework that has been applied in the 
preparation of the parent company financial statements is applicable 
law and United Kingdom Accounting Standards (United Kingdom 
Generally Accepted Accounting Practice), including FRS 101 
“Reduced Disclosure Framework”.
This report is made solely to the Company’s members, as a body, 
in accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies Act 2006. 
Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might state to the 
Company’s members those matters we are required to state to them 
in an auditor’s report and for no other purpose. To the fullest extent 
permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility to 
anyone other than the Company and the Company’s members 
as a body, for our audit work, for this report, or for the opinions 
we have formed.
Respective responsibilities of Directors and auditor
As explained more fully in the Directors’ Responsibilities Statement, 
the Directors are responsible for the preparation of the financial 
statements and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view. 
Our responsibility is to audit and express an opinion on the financial 
statements in accordance with applicable law and International 
Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland). Those standards require 
us to comply with the Auditing Practices Board’s Ethical Standards 
for Auditors.
Scope of the audit of the financial statements
An audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts and 
disclosures in the financial statements sufficient to give reasonable 
assurance that the financial statements are free from material 
misstatement, whether caused by fraud or error. This includes an 
assessment of: whether the accounting policies are appropriate 
to the Group’s and the parent company’s circumstances and have 
been consistently applied and adequately disclosed; the 
reasonableness of significant accounting estimates made by the 
Directors; and the overall presentation of the financial statements. 
In addition, we read all the financial and non-financial information 
in the Annual Report to identify material inconsistencies with the 
audited financial statements and to identify any information that is 
apparently materially incorrect based on, or materially inconsistent 
with, the knowledge acquired by us in the course of performing the 
audit. If we become aware of any apparent material misstatements 
or inconsistencies we consider the implications for our report.
Opinion on financial statements
In our opinion:
 → the financial statements give a true and fair view of the state 
of the Group’s and of the parent company’s affairs as at 
31 December 2015 and of the Group’s and the parent 
company’s profit for the year then ended;
 → the Group financial statements have been properly prepared 
in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the European Union;
 → the parent company financial statements have been properly 
prepared in accordance with United Kingdom Generally 
Accepted Accounting Practice; and
 → the financial statements have been prepared in accordance 
with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006.
Opinion on other matters prescribed by the 
Companies Act 2006
In our opinion the information given in the strategic report and 
the Directors’ report for the financial year for which the financial 
statements are prepared is consistent with the financial statements.
Matters on which we are required to report by exception
We have nothing to report in respect of the following matters where 
the Companies Act 2006 requires us to report to you if, in our opinion:
 → adequate accounting records have not been kept by the parent 
company, or returns adequate for our audit have not been 
received from branches not visited by us; or
 → the parent company financial statements are not in agreement 
with the accounting records and returns; or
 → certain disclosures of Directors’ remuneration specified by law 
are not made; or
 → we have not received all the information and explanations we 
require for our audit.

domiciled in England. The Company was incorporated on 17 
March 2014 as Gamma Communications Limited. The Company 
changed its name to Gamma Communications plc on 3 October 
2014 when it became a public company.
The Group was formed on 12 May 2014 when Gamma 
Communications Limited acquired the entire share capital of Gamma 
Telecom Holdings Limited and its wholly owned subsidiaries through 
the issue of 20,590,196 Ordinary Shares and 1,699,983 B1 Shares 
(further detail on the share capital is set out in note 21). 
The acquisitions of the subsidiaries are deemed to be 
‘combinations under common control’ as ultimate control before 
and after the acquisition was the same. As a result, the transaction 
is outside the scope of IFRS 3 “Business combinations” and has 
been included under the principles of merger accounting by 
reference to UK GAAP . 
Accordingly, although the units which comprise the Group did 
not form a legal group for the entirety of the prior period, the 
comparative results comprise the results of the subsidiary 
companies as if the Group had been in existence throughout 
the entire prior period. 
These financial statements have been prepared in accordance 
with International Financial Reporting Standards, International 
Accounting Standards and Interpretations (collectively IFRS) 
issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) 
as adopted by the European Union (“adopted IFRSs”), and are in 
accordance with IFRS as issued by the IASB, and are presented 
in Sterling and, unless otherwise stated, have been rounded to 
the nearest 0.1 million (£m).
The principal accounting policies adopted in the preparation of the 
financial statements are set out below. The policies have been 
consistently applied to all the years presented.
Standards, amendments and interpretations to existing standards that 
are not yet effective and have not been adopted early by the Group
At the date of authorisation of these financial statements, certain 
new standards and amendments to existing standards have been 
published by the IASB that are not yet effective, and have not been 
adopted early by the Group. New accounting standards expected 
to be relevant to the Group are listed below.
 → IFRS 15 Revenue and Contracts with Customers (effective 
1 January 2018).
 → IFRS 16 Leases (effective 1 January 2019).
 → Amendments to IAS 16 and IAS 38 clarifying Acceptable 
Methods of Depreciation and Amortisation (effective date 
1 January 2016).
 → Annual improvements to IFRSs 2012-2014 Cycle (effective 
1 January 2016).
Management anticipates that all relevant pronouncements will 
be adopted in the Group’s accounting policies for the first period 
beginning after the effective date of the pronouncement. 
IFRS 15 was published in May 2014 and the effective date 
has been delayed to reporting periods beginning on or after 
1 January 2018. Therefore, following the finalisation of the 
standard and IFRS 16, the Group is in the process of assessing 
the impact of this.
Going concern
The Directors prepare a detailed annual budget and constantly 
reforecast for the next 12 month period. The Group has a significant 
cash balance of £24.8m (2014: £13.4m) and is not reliant on any 
debt facilities. Therefore, at the time of approving the financial 
statements, the Directors have a reasonable expectation that the 
Company and the Group have adequate resources to continue in 
operational existence for the foreseeable future. Thus they continue 
to adopt the going concern basis of accounting in preparing the 
financial statements.
Basis of consolidation
The Group financial statements consolidate those of the parent 
company and all of its subsidiaries. The parent controls a 
subsidiary if it has power over the investee to significantly direct the 
activities, exposure or rights to variable returns from its involvement 
with the investee, and the ability to use its power over the investee 
to affect the amount of the investor’s returns. All subsidiaries have 
a reporting date of 31 December.
All transactions and balances between Group companies are 
eliminated on consolidation, including unrealised gains and losses 
on transactions between Group companies. Where unrealised 
losses on intra-Group asset sales are reversed on consolidation, 
the underlying asset is also tested for impairment from a Group 
perspective. Amounts reported in the financial statements of 
subsidiaries have been adjusted where necessary to ensure 
consistency with the accounting policies adopted by the Group.
Profit or loss and other comprehensive income of subsidiaries 
acquired or disposed of during the year are recognised from the 
effective date of acquisition, or up to the effective date of disposal, 
as applicable.
The consolidated financial statements consist of the results of the 
entities shown in note 13.
As set out in the basis of preparation note, the units which 
comprise the Group have all been under common management 
and control throughout the period presented in the consolidated 
financial information but they did not form a legal group throughout 
the prior period, the Group coming into existence on 12 May 2014. 
As a result, the Group Reconstruction is outside the scope of 
IFRS 3 “Business combinations”. In accordance with IAS 8, the 
Directors have determined that the most appropriate method of 
accounting for the Group Reconstruction is to follow the principles 
of merger accounting by reference to UK GAAP . 
Notes forming part of the financial statements 
For the year ended 31 December 2015
Financial statements 57
Financial statements Corporate governance Strategic report
Gamma Communications plc Annual Report and Accounts 2015
The aim of merger accounting is to show the results and financial 
position of the Group as if the Group had always been in existence, 
as follows:
 → the results of the subsidiaries have been included in the 
consolidated results for the entire comparative period during 
which the Group Reconstruction took place; and
 → the consolidated results include the assets and liabilities 
of the subsidiaries at the book values at which they were 
recorded prior to the Group Reconstruction: there is no 
requirement to fair value, and no goodwill arises as a result. 
The share capital issued to effect the merger has been shown 
as if it had always been issued.
These financial statements incorporate the results of business 
combinations using the acquisition method with the exception 
of the common control transaction on the forming of the Group. 
In the statement of financial position, the acquiree’s identifiable 
assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities are initially recognised 
at their fair values at the acquisition date. The results of acquired 
operations are included in the consolidated statement of 
comprehensive income from the date on which control is obtained. 
They are deconsolidated from the date control ceases.
Revenue
Revenue represents the fair value of the consideration received 
or receivable for communication services and equipment sales, 
net of discounts and sales taxes. 
Revenue is recognised when it is probable that the economic 
benefits associated with a transaction will flow to the Group and the 
amount of revenue and associated costs can be measured reliably.
The Group sells a number of communications products (both 
traditional and new) each of which typically consists of all or some of 
four main types of revenue – voice and data traffic, a subscription or 
rental, equipment and installation fees. Revenue for each element of 
the sale of the product is recognised as described below.
To the extent that invoices are raised to a different pattern than the 
revenue recognition described below, appropriate adjustments are 
made through deferred and accrued income to account for 
revenue when the underlying service has been performed or 
goods have transferred to the customer.
Voice and data traffic
Revenue from traffic is recognised at the time the call is made.
Revenue arising from the interconnection of voice and data traffic 
between other telecommunications’ operators is recognised at the 
time of transit across the Group’s network.
Subscriptions and rentals
Revenue from the rental of analogue and digital lines is recognised 
evenly over the period to which the charges relate. 
Subscription fees, consisting primarily of monthly charges for access 
to broadband, hosted IP services and other internet access or voice 
services, are recognised as revenue as the service is provided. 
Equipment sales
Revenue from the sale of peripheral and other equipment is 
recognised when all the significant risks and rewards of ownership are 
transferred to the buyer, which is normally the date the equipment is 
delivered and accepted by the customer. Where the buyer has a right 
of return, the Group defers recognition of revenue until the right to 
return has lapsed. However, where the Group retains only insignificant 
risks of ownership due to the right of return, revenue is not deferred, 
but the Group recognises a provision based on previous experience 
and other relevant factors. The same policy applies to warranties.
Installations
Revenue arising from installation and connection services is 
recognised when it is earned, upon activation.
Arrangements with multiple deliverables
Where goods and/or services are sold in one bundled transaction, 
the Group allocates the total arrangement’s consideration to the 
different individual elements based on their relative fair values. 
Management determines the fair values of individual components 
based on actual amounts charged by the Group on a stand-alone 
basis, or alternatively based on comparable pricing arrangements 
observable in the market.
Advances made to channel partners
Where the Group can demonstrate recovery of the asset (being 
the advances made) through contractual claw back provisions 
and past evidence of recovery they are deferred and are 
recognised over the period of the contract. Where this is not 
possible they are charged directly to the consolidated statement 
of comprehensive income.
Business Combinations
Goodwill represents the excess of the cost of a business combination 
over, in the case of business combinations completed prior to 
1 January 2011, the Group’s interest in the fair value of identifiable 
assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities acquired and, in the case 
of business combinations completed on or after 1 January 2011, 
the total acquisition date fair value of the identifiable assets, 
liabilities and contingent liabilities acquired. 
For business combinations completed prior to 1 January 2011, 
cost comprised the fair value of assets acquired, liabilities 
assumed and equity instruments issued, plus any direct costs 
of acquisition. Changes in the estimated value of contingent 
consideration arising on business combinations completed by this 
date were treated as an adjustment to cost and, in consequence, 
resulted in a change in the carrying value of goodwill. 
For business combinations completed on or after 1 January 2011, 
cost comprises the fair value of assets acquired, liabilities assumed 
and equity instruments issued, plus the amount of any non-controlling 
interests in the acquiree plus, if the business combination is achieved 
in stages, the fair value of the existing equity interest in the acquiree. 58
1. Accounting policies continued
Contingent consideration
Contingent consideration is included in cost at its acquisition date 
fair value and is classified as a financial liability, re-measured at fair 
value subsequently through profit or loss. Contingent consideration 
classified as equity is not re-measured.
Direct costs
For business combinations completed on or after 1 January 2011, 
direct costs of acquisition are recognised immediately as an expense. 
Goodwill
Goodwill is capitalised as an intangible asset with any impairment 
in carrying value being charged to the consolidated statement 
of comprehensive income. Where the fair value of identifiable 
assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities exceeds the fair value of 
consideration paid, the excess is credited in full to the consolidated 
statement of comprehensive income on the acquisition date. 
Intangible assets
An intangible asset, which is an identifiable non-monetary asset 
without physical substance, is recognised to the extent that it is 
probable that the expected future economic benefits attributable 
to the asset will flow to the Group and that its cost can be 
measured reliably. The asset is deemed to be identifiable when it 
is separable or when it arises from contractual or other legal rights.
Intangible assets acquired as part of a business combination are 
shown at fair value at the date of the acquisition less accumulated 
amortisation. Amortisation is charged on a straight line basis 
through the profit or loss. The rates applicable, which represent 
the Directors’ best estimate of the useful economic life, are:
 → customer contracts – five years.
Impairment of non-financial assets (excluding inventories 
and deferred tax assets)
Impairment tests on goodwill and other intangible assets with 
indefinite useful economic lives are undertaken annually at the 
financial year end. Other non-financial assets are subject to 
impairment tests whenever events or changes in circumstances 
indicate that their carrying amount may not be recoverable. 
Where the carrying value of an asset exceeds its recoverable 
amount (i.e. the higher of value in use and fair value less costs 
to sell), the asset is written down accordingly.
Where it is not possible to estimate the recoverable amount of an 
individual asset, the impairment test is carried out on the smallest 
group of assets to which it belongs for which there are separately 
identifiable cash flows: its cash generating units (‘CGUs’). Goodwill 
is allocated on initial recognition to each of the Group’s CGUs that 
are expected to benefit from the synergies of the combination 
giving rise to the goodwill.
Impairment charges are included in profit or loss, except to 
the extent they reverse gains previously recognised in other 
comprehensive income. An impairment loss recognised for 
goodwill is not reversed.
Development costs
Expenditure on the research phase of an internal project is 
recognised as an expense in the period in which it is incurred. 
Development costs incurred on specific projects (whether in 
respect of new products or enhancement of existing products) 
are capitalised when all the following conditions are satisfied:
 → completion of the asset is technically feasible so that it will 
be available for use or sale;
 → the Group intends to complete the asset and use or sell it;
 → the Group has the ability to use or sell the asset and the asset 
will generate probable future economic benefits (over and 
above cost);
 → there are adequate technical, financial and other resources 
to complete the development and to use or sell the asset; and
 → the expenditure attributable to the asset during its development 
can be measured reliably.
Development costs not meeting the criteria for capitalisation are 
expensed as incurred. The cost of an internally generated asset 
comprises all directly attributable costs necessary to create, 
produce and prepare the asset to be capable of operating in 
the manner intended by management. Directly attributable costs 
include employee (other than Directors’) costs incurred along with 
third party costs.
Judgement by the Directors is applied when deciding whether the 
recognition requirements for development costs have been met. 
Judgements are based on the information available at each 
statement of financial position date. In addition, all internal activities 
related to the research and development of new projects are 
continuously monitored by the Directors. Amortisation is charged 
to the income statement on a straight line basis over the estimated 
useful life from the date the asset is available for use.
Foreign currency
Transactions entered into by Group entities in a currency other than 
the currency of the primary economic environment in which they 
operate are recorded at the rates ruling when the transactions occur. 
Foreign currency monetary assets and liabilities are translated at 
the rates ruling at the reporting date. Exchange differences arising 
on the retranslation of unsettled monetary assets and liabilities are 
recognised immediately in profit or loss, except for foreign currency 
borrowings qualifying as a hedge of a net investment in a foreign 
operation, in which case exchange differences are recognised 
in other comprehensive income and accumulated in the foreign 
exchange reserve along with the exchange differences arising 
on the retranslation of the foreign operation.
On consolidation, the results of overseas operations are 
translated into sterling at rates approximating to those ruling 
when the transactions took place. All assets and liabilities of 
overseas operations, including goodwill arising on the acquisition 
of those operations, are translated at the rate ruling at the reporting 
date. Exchange differences arising on translating the opening net 
assets at opening rate and the results of overseas operations at 
actual rate are recognised in other comprehensive income and 
accumulated in the foreign exchange reserve.

Gamma Communications plc Annual Report and Accounts 2015
Exchange differences recognised in the profit or loss of Group 
entities on the translation of long term monetary items forming part 
of the Group’s net investment in the overseas operation concerned 
are reclassified to other comprehensive income and accumulated 
in the foreign exchange reserve on consolidation.
On disposal of a foreign operation, the cumulative exchange 
differences recognised in the foreign exchange reserve relating 
to that operation up to the date of disposal are transferred to the 
consolidated statement of comprehensive income as part of the 
profit or loss on disposal.
Segment reporting
Operating segments are reported in a manner consistent with the 
internal reporting provided to the chief operating decision-maker. 
The chief operating decision-makers have been identified as the 
Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer, Chief Operating 
Officer and the Management Committee. For further details 
please see note 4.
Financial assets
The Group does not have any financial assets which it would 
classify as fair value through profit or loss, available for sale or 
held to maturity. Therefore, all financial assets are classed as 
loans and receivables as defined below.
Loans and receivables
These assets are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or 
determinable payments that are not quoted in an active market. 
They arise principally through the provision of goods and services 
to customers (e.g. trade receivables), but also incorporate other 
types of contractual monetary asset. 
They are initially recognised at fair value plus transaction costs 
that are directly attributable to their acquisition or issue, and are 
subsequently carried at amortised cost using the effective interest 
rate method, less provision for impairment. 
Impairment provisions are recognised when there is objective 
evidence (such as significant financial difficulties on the part of 
the counterparty or default or significant delay in payment) that the 
Group will be unable to collect all of the amounts due, the amount 
of such a provision being the difference between the net carrying 
amount and the present value of the future expected cash flows 
associated with the impaired receivable. For trade receivables, 
which are reported net, such provisions are recorded in a 
separate allowance account with the loss being recognised 
within administrative expenses in the consolidated statement of 
comprehensive income. On confirmation that the trade receivable 
will not be collectable, the gross carrying value of the asset is 
written off against the associated provision.
The Group’s loans and receivables comprise trade and other 
receivables and cash and cash equivalents in the consolidated 
statement of financial position. 
Cash and cash equivalents includes cash in hand, deposits held 
at call with banks, other short term highly liquid investments with 
original maturities of three months or less, and – for the purpose 
of the statement of cash flows – bank overdrafts. Bank overdrafts 
are shown within loans and borrowings in current liabilities on 
the consolidated statement of financial position.
Financial liabilities
Apart from contingent consideration in the prior year the Group 
does not have any financial liabilities that would be classified as fair 
value through profit or loss. Therefore, these financial liabilities are 
classified as financial liabilities at amortised cost, as defined below. 
Other financial liabilities include the following items:
 → trade payables and other short term monetary liabilities, which 
are initially recognised at fair value and subsequently carried 
at amortised cost using the effective interest method.
Share capital
The Group’s Ordinary Shares and Deferred Shares are classified 
as equity instruments.
Retirement benefits: defined contribution schemes
Contributions to defined contribution pension schemes are 
charged to the consolidated statement of comprehensive income 
in the year to which they relate.
Share based payments
Where equity settled shares or share options are awarded to 
employees, the fair value of the options at the date of grant is 
charged to the consolidated statement of comprehensive income 
over the vesting period. Non-market vesting conditions are taken 
into account by adjusting the number of equity instruments 
expected to vest at each reporting date so that, ultimately, the 
cumulative amount recognised over the vesting period is based on 
the number of options that eventually vest. Non-vesting conditions 
and market vesting conditions are factored into the fair value of the 
options granted. As long as all other vesting conditions are 
satisfied, a charge is made irrespective of whether the market 
vesting conditions are satisfied. The cumulative expense is not 
adjusted for failure to achieve a market vesting condition or where 
a non-vesting condition is not satisfied.
Where the terms and conditions of options are modified before 
they vest, the increase in the fair value of the options, measured 
immediately before and after the modification, is also charged to 
the consolidated statement of comprehensive income over the 
remaining vesting period.
The fair value of the options is measured by use of either the 
Black-Scholes method or the Monte Carlo method; the latter 
methodology being used where there are market conditions 
attached to the share awards. 
Prior to flotation, the Group also operated a shadow share option 
scheme (a cash settled share based payment). An option pricing 
model was used to measure the Group’s liability at each reporting 
date, taking into account the terms and conditions on which the 
bonus is awarded and the extent to which employees have 
rendered service. Movements in the liability were recognised in the 
consolidated statement of comprehensive income. All such awards 
crystallised on flotation and were settled in 2014. No new awards 
have been made. 60
1. Accounting policies continued
Exceptional items
The Group treats certain items which are considered to be one-off 
and not representative of the underlying trading of the Group as 
exceptional in nature.
The Directors apply judgement in assessing the particular items, 
which by virtue of their scale and nature should be classified as 
exceptional items. The Directors consider that separate disclosure 
of these items is relevant to an understanding of the Group’s 
financial performance.
Leased assets
Where substantially all of the risks and rewards incidental to 
ownership are not transferred to the Group (an “operating lease”), 
the total rentals payable under the lease are charged to the 
consolidated statement of comprehensive income on a straight 
line basis over the lease term. The aggregate benefit of lease 
incentives is recognised as a reduction of the rental expense 
over the lease term on a straight line basis.
Dividends
Dividends are recognised when they become legally payable. 
In the case of interim dividends to equity shareholders, this is 
when declared by the Directors. In the case of final dividends, 
this is when approved by the Shareholders at the AGM. Dividend 
distributions payable to equity shareholders are included in other 
liabilities when the dividends have been approved in a general 
meeting prior to the reporting date.
T axation
The tax expense represents the sum of the tax currently payable 
and deferred tax.
Current tax
The tax currently payable is based on taxable profit for the year. 
Taxable profit differs from net profit as reported in the statement 
of comprehensive income because it excludes items of income 
or expense that are taxable or deductible in other years, it includes 
items that are tax deductible but which do not affect net profit and 
it further excludes items that are never taxable or deductible.
Deferred tax
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognised where the 
carrying amount of an asset or liability in the consolidated 
statement of financial position differs from its tax base, except 
for differences arising on:
 → the initial recognition of goodwill;
 → the initial recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction 
which is not a business combination and at the time of the 
transaction affects neither accounting or taxable profit; and
 → investments in subsidiaries and jointly controlled entities 
where the Group is able to control the timing of the reversal 
of the difference and it is probable that the difference will not 
reverse in the foreseeable future.
Recognition of deferred tax assets is restricted to those instances 
where it is probable that taxable profit will be available against 
which the deductible temporary differences can be utilised.
Deferred tax is calculated at the tax rates that are expected 
to apply in the period when the liability is settled or the asset is 
realised based on tax laws and rates that have been enacted or 
substantively enacted at the statement of financial position date. 
Deferred tax is charged or credited in the income statement, 
except when it relates to items charged or credited in other 
comprehensive income, in which case the deferred tax is 
also dealt with in other comprehensive income.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally 
enforceable right to set off current tax assets against current tax 
liabilities and when they relate to income taxes levied by the same 
taxation authority and the Group intends to settle its current tax 
assets and liabilities on a net basis.
Current tax and deferred tax for the year
Current and deferred tax are recognised in profit or loss, except when 
they relate to items that are recognised in other comprehensive 
income or directly in equity, in which case, the current and deferred 
tax are also recognised in other comprehensive income or directly in 
equity respectively. Where current tax or deferred tax arises from the 
initial accounting for a business combination, the tax effect is included 
in the accounting for the business combination.
Property, plant and equipment
Items of property, plant and equipment are initially recognised at 
cost. As well as the purchase price, cost includes directly attributable 
costs and the estimated present value of any future unavoidable 
costs of dismantling and removing items. The corresponding liability 
is recognised within provisions.
Assets in the course of construction for use in the supply of 
communication products, or for administration purposes not yet 
determined, are carried at cost, less any recognised impairment 
loss. Cost includes professional fees. Depreciation of these assets, 
on the same basis as other assets, commences when the assets 
are ready for their intended use.
Assets which are supplied to customers as part of a service (for 
example, a broadband router or a telephone handset), known as 
Customer Premises Equipment, are capitalised and depreciated 
over the expected period of the provision of that service.
Depreciation is provided on all other items of property, plant and 
equipment so as to write off their carrying value over their expected 
useful economic lives. It is provided at the following rates:
 
Network assets 10%–33% per annum straight line
Customer Premises Equipment 20%–50% per annum straight line
Computer equipment 25%–50% per annum straight line
Fixtures and fittings 20%–25% per annum straight line

Inventories
Inventories are initially recognised at cost, and subsequently at the 
lower of cost and net realisable value. Cost comprises all costs of 
purchase, costs of conversion and other costs incurred in bringing 
the inventories to their present location and condition.
Weighted average cost is used to determine the cost of ordinarily 
interchangeable items.
Work in progress is stated at the lower of cost, comprising direct 
materials and labour plus attributable overheads less provision for 
foreseeable losses and progress payments, and net realisable value.
Employee Benefit T rust (EBT)
As the Company is deemed to have control of its EBTs, they are 
treated as subsidiaries and consolidated for the purposes of the 
consolidated financial statements. The EBTs’ assets (other than 
investments in the Company’s shares), liabilities, income and 
expenses are included on a line-by-line basis in the consolidated 
financial statements. 
Provisions
The Group recognises provisions where there is a present 
obligation as a result of a prior event. The Group has recognised 
provisions for liabilities of uncertain timing or amount relating to 
leasehold dilapidations or onerous lease provision. The provision is 
measured at the best estimate of the expenditure required to settle 
the obligation at the reporting date, discounted at a pre-tax rate 
reflecting current market assessments of the time value of money 
and risks specific to the liability. 
Adjusted measures
Throughout this report, adjusted EBITDA is defined as earnings 
before interest, taxation, depreciation and amortisation stated before 
exceptional items and share based payment charges. Also, adjusted 
EPS is defined as earnings after tax adjusted for share based 
payment charges, exceptional items and the associated tax effect. 
These are non-GAAP measures. Exceptional items are those which 
are considered significant by virtue of their nature, size or incidence, 
and are presented separately in the income statement to enable a full 
understanding of the Group’s financial performance. The Group 
believes that adjusted EBITDA provides valuable additional 
information for users of the financial statements in assessing 
the Group’s performance since it provides information on the 
performance of the business that local managers are more directly 
able to influence and on a basis consistent across the Group.
2. Critical accounting estimates and judgements
The Group makes certain estimates and assumptions regarding 
the future. Estimates and judgements are continually evaluated 
based on historical experience and other factors, including 
expectations of future events that are believed to be reasonable 
under the circumstances. In the future, actual experience may 
differ from these estimates and assumptions. The estimates 
and assumptions that have a significant risk of causing a material 
adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within 
the next financial year are discussed below.
(a) Valuation of intangibles
Acquisitions may result in customer contracts being recognised. 
These are valued using discounted cash flow methods which 
require the application of certain key judgements and estimates. 
In particular, management has had to estimate the likely future rate 
of contract renewals, which involves a level of judgement due to 
the short trading history of the acquisition. If the contract renewals 
are lower than estimated, this may result in an impairment to the 
asset valuation. The level of renewal experienced to date supports 
management’s estimates.
(b) Impairment of goodwill
The Group is required to test, on an annual basis, whether 
goodwill has suffered any impairment. The recoverable amount 
is determined based on value in use calculations. The use of this 
method requires the estimation of future cash flows and the choice 
of a discount rate in order to calculate the present value of the cash 
flows. Actual outcomes may vary. Impairment testing has not 
indicated any impairment in goodwill over the period end dates.
(c) T axation
Significant judgement is required in determining the provision 
for income taxes. During the ordinary course of business, there 
are transactions and calculations for which the ultimate tax 
determination is uncertain. As a result, the Company recognises 
tax liabilities based on estimates of whether additional taxes and 
interest will be due. These tax liabilities are recognised when, 
despite the Group’s belief that its tax return positions are 
supportable, the Group believes that certain positions could be 
challenged upon review by tax authorities. The Group believes that 
its accruals for tax liabilities are adequate for all open years based 
on its assessment of many factors, including past experience and 
interpretations of tax law. This assessment relies on estimates and 
assumptions and may involve a series of complex judgements 
about future events. To the extent that the final tax outcome of 
these matters is different from the amounts recorded, such 
differences will impact income tax expense in the period in which 
such determination is made.
(d) Leasehold dilapidations
Leasehold dilapidations relate to the estimated cost of returning 
a leasehold property to a defined condition at the end of the lease 
in accordance with the lease terms. Once the stage of the lease 
has been reached at which a reliable estimate of the costs can be 
made, a provision is recognised in the profit and loss. The main 
uncertainty relates to estimating the cost that will be incurred at 
the end of the lease.
(e) Capitalisation of internal development costs
The Group carries out a number of research and development 
projects. Some of these projects consist of speculative research 
whilst others are considered to be closer to the maintenance 
of existing systems. However, where a piece of development is 
producing an asset which will be used within the business or sold 
directly (and it is probable that it will generate future economic 
benefits) then the development cost is capitalised and amortised 
over the useful economic life. Each year the Directors consider the 
work which has been performed by the development team and, 
where it is assessed that the appropriate criteria are met, the costs 
are capitalised; this involves inherent judgement as to the likely 
future economic benefit to be derived from the asset. 62
(f) Share based payment charges
The Company runs a number of share option schemes which give 
rise to share based payment charges. The calculation of the charges 
involves a significant level of estimate particularly around market 
volatility and yield. In instances where there are performance 
conditions (i.e. the LTIP scheme) the Directors must also consider 
the likelihood of the performance conditions being met. The Directors 
use the services of a firm of Chartered Accountants (who are not the 
Auditor) to assist with these valuations.
3. Revenue
Revenue in all periods principally arises from the provision of 
services. There is an immaterial level of sales of goods (which are 
not part of a service). 
4. Segment information
The Group has two main operating segments:
 → indirect – this division sells Gamma’s traditional and new 
products and services to channel partners and contributed 
79% (2014: 79%) of the Group’s external revenue; and 
 → direct – this division sells Gamma’s traditional and new 
products and services to end users in the SME, Enterprise and 
public sectors together with an associated service wrap. They 
contributed 21% (2014: 21%) of the Group’s external revenues.
There are no material non UK segments and no material non-
current assets outside the UK.
Both operating segments sell a combination of traditional products 
and services (which is mainly voice traffic from which revenues are 
derived from channel partners and other carriers as well as rentals 
for wholesale lines) and new products and services (which consist 
of IP voice traffic, rental income derived from SIP Trunking, hosted 
IP voice systems and Gamma’s hosted inbound product and 
data products).
Factors that management used to identify the Group’s 
reportable segments
The Group’s reportable segments are strategic business units 
that offer products and services into different markets. They are 
managed separately because each business requires different 
marketing strategies and are reported separately to the Board 
and management team.
Measurement of operating segment profit or loss, assets and liabilities
The accounting policies of the operating segments are the same as 
those described in the summary of significant accounting policies.
The Group evaluates performance on the basis of profit or loss 
from operations but excluding non-recurring losses, such as 
goodwill impairment, the effects of share based payments and 
exceptional income.
Inter-segment sales are priced along the same lines as sales to 
external customers, with an appropriate discount being applied 
to encourage use of Group resources at a rate acceptable to local 
tax authorities. This policy was applied consistently throughout the 
current and prior period. 
Loans and borrowings are allocated to the segments based on 
relevant factors (e.g. funding requirements). Details are provided in the 
reconciliation from segment assets and liabilities to the Group position.

IPO costs relate to the professional fees incurred on the admission of the Group to AIM.
The change in the fair value of contingent consideration is because during the course of the year ended 31 December 2014 the Directors 
took an opportunity to settle the consideration relating to the purchase of Varidion Limited. 
Ladder pricing was a mechanism which was used by fixed line operators to bill other operators for calls to certain 08 numbers. 
Gamma has now reached a commercial settlement in regard to its ladder pricing policy with the affected operators and these have 
now concluded, resulting in an exceptional gain of £5.7m. There was a non-recurring cash inflow of £5.1m, £0.6m was received 
previously but not recognised as income as the invoices had been disputed.

18% from 1 April 2020 was substantively enacted on 26 October 2015. For the purposes of deferred tax, the rate change from 20% 
to 18% was substantively enacted before the balance sheet date.
10. Earnings per share and dividends
Earnings per share
The calculation of basic earnings per Ordinary Share is based on a profit after tax of £18.3m (2014: profit of £9.4m) and 89,488,163 
(2014: 88,349,480) Ordinary Shares, being the weighted average number of Ordinary Shares in issue during the period (in the prior 
period, this was adjusted for the fact that there was a share split). Also, in the prior period, because the Group was formed by a share 
for share exchange, it has been assumed that the number of shares at incorporation was the number of shares between 1 January 2013 
and incorporation for the purposes of calculating a weighted average for the earnings per share calculation.
The unadjusted diluted earnings per Ordinary Share is calculated by including in the weighted average number of shares the dilutive 
effect of potential Ordinary Shares related to committed share options as described in note 25. For 2015, the unadjusted diluted 
Ordinary Shares were based on 93,226,438 Ordinary Shares (2014: 93,601,600) that included 3,738,275 potential Ordinary Shares 
(2014: 5,252,120).
The following reflects the income and share data used in the calculation of adjusted earnings per share computations before share based 
payments, one-off items and their associated tax effect.

The estimates of the useful economic lives of the intangible assets are as follows:
 → customer contracts – five years;
 → development costs – over anticipated UEL of asset developed but no more than four years; and
 → goodwill on consolidation – indefinite (subject to impairment).
The carrying amount of goodwill is allocated to the cash generating units (CGUs) as follows:
2015
£m
2014
£m
Gamma Business Communications Limited 6.8 6.8
Gamma Network Solutions Limited 1.2 1.2
8.0 8.0
The carrying value of the Group’s goodwill is not subject to annual amortisation and was tested for impairment at 31 December 2015 and 
2014. The recoverable amount has been determined on a value-in-use basis on each CGU using the Board approved 12-month budget for 
each CGU. The base 24-month projection is amended for years two to five as follows: (a) by increasing revenue by 5% for Gamma Business 
Communications Limited and by 20% for Gamma Network Solutions Limited (being based on historical growth rates); (b) gross margin 
percentage is assumed to be held constant (based on historical data); and (c) overheads are assumed to grow in line with inflation for 
Gamma Business Communications Limited and by 15% for Gamma Network Solutions Limited. These cash flows are then discounted 
at 12% – both CGUs form the direct part of the Group and therefore it is appropriate to use a single discount rate across both CGUs.
Based on the results of the impairment reviews carried out for each period (giving a recoverable amount of £23.9m in respect of 
Gamma Business Communications Limited and £12.2m in respect of Gamma Network Solutions Limited), no impairment charges have 
been recognised by the Group in either of the years. Management has considered various sensitivity analyses in order to appropriately 
evaluate the carrying value of goodwill. Having assessed the anticipated future cash flows, the Directors do not consider there to be any 
reasonably possible changes in assumptions that would lead to such an impairment charge in any of the years.

fair value.
As at 31 December 2015 and 2014, trade receivables as shown below were past due but not impaired. They relate to customers with no 
default history or where we have an offset arrangement. The ageing analysis of these receivables is as follows:

As at 31 December 2015, trade receivables of £0.9m (2014: £0.9m) were past due and impaired. The amount of the provision as at 
31 December was £1.2m (2014: £1.2m). The main factors considered by the Credit Committee in determining that the amounts due 
are impaired are that the customers are unlikely to be trading or the debts are three months and more past due. The ageing of these 
receivables is as follows:

implementation of the objectives and policies to the Group’s Management Committee. The Board receives quarterly reports from the 
Management Committee through which it reviews the effectiveness of the processes put in place and the appropriateness of the 
objectives and policies it sets. 
The overall objective of the Board is to set policies that seek to reduce risk as far as possible without unduly affecting the Group’s 
competitiveness and flexibility. Further details regarding these policies are set out on the next page: 72
18. Financial instruments – risk management continued
Credit risk
Credit risk is the risk of financial loss to the Group if a customer or a counterparty to a financial instrument fails to meet its contractual 
obligations. The Group is mainly exposed to credit risk from credit sales. It is Group policy, implemented locally, to assess the credit risk 
of new customers before entering contracts. Such credit ratings are taken into account by local business practices. 
The Credit Committee has established a credit policy under which each new customer is analysed individually for creditworthiness 
before the Group’s standard payment and delivery terms and conditions are offered. The Group’s review includes external ratings when 
available. Purchase limits are established for each customer, which represent the maximum open amount without requiring approval from 
the Credit Committee. 
The Credit Committee determines concentrations of credit risk by quarterly monitoring the creditworthiness rating of existing customers 
and through a monthly review of the trade receivables’ ageing analysis. 
Credit risk also arises from cash and cash equivalents and deposits with banks and financial institutions. For banks and financial 
institutions, only independently rated parties with high credit status are accepted.
The Group does not enter into derivatives to manage credit risk. 
Quantitative disclosures of the credit risk exposure in relation to financial assets are set out below. Further disclosures regarding trade 
and other receivables, which are neither past due nor impaired, are provided in note 15.

Trade receivables – net 18.2 16.7
Accrued income 8.1 7.6
Other receivables 3.9 3.6
Total financial assets 55.0 41.3
The Credit Committee monitors the utilisation of the credit limits regularly and at the reporting date does not expect any losses from 
non-performance by the counterparties.
Cash in bank
The Group is continually reviewing the credit risk associated with holding money on deposit in banks and seeks to mitigate this risk 
by holding deposits with banks with high credit status.
Fair value and cash flow interest rate risk
As of 31 December 2014 and 31 December 2015, the Group’s exposure to fair value and cash flow interest rate risk was not material. 
It is Group policy that all borrowings are approved by the Chief Financial Officer to ensure that it is not taking on significant risk related 
to possible movements in interest rates. Although the Board accepts that this policy neither protects the Group entirely from the risk 
of paying rates in excess of current market rates nor eliminates fully cash flow risk associated with variability in interest payments, 
it considers that it achieves an appropriate balance of exposure to these risks.
Market risk
The market risk relates to foreign exchange. Foreign exchange risk arises because the Group has a small operation located in Hungary 
whose functional currency is not the same as the functional currency in which the Group companies are operating. Although the fact that its 
overseas operations are small compared to those in the UK reduces the Group’s operational risk, the Group’s net assets arising from such 
overseas operations are exposed to currency risk resulting in gains or losses on retranslation into sterling. Given the levels of materiality, the 
Group does not hedge its net investments in overseas operations as the cost of doing so is disproportionate to the exposure.
Foreign exchange risk also arises when individual Group entities enter into transactions denominated in a currency other than their 
functional currency; the Group has very few customers who are invoiced in currency other than sterling and very few suppliers invoice 
in currency other than sterling. Again, these transactions are not hedged because the cost of doing so is disproportionate to the risk.
As of 31 December 2014 and 31 December 2015, the Group’s exposure to foreign exchange risk was not material. 
A sensitivity analysis for market risk has not been prepared as the risk is immaterial.

Liquidity risk
Liquidity risk arises from the Group’s management of working capital. It is the risk that the Group will encounter difficulty in meeting its 
financial obligations as they fall due.
It is the Group’s aim to settle balances as they become due.
 
The Board receives annual 24-month cash flow projections. At the end of the financial year, these projections indicated that the Group 
expected to have sufficient liquid resources to meet its obligations under all reasonably expected circumstances.

Capital disclosures
The Group manages its capital to ensure that entities in the Group will be able to continue as a going concern while maximising its return 
to shareholders through the optimisation of the debt and equity balance. The Group’s overall strategy remains unchanged from the prior 
year. The Group monitors “adjusted capital”, which comprises all components of equity (i.e. share capital, share premium reserve, merger 
reserve, share option reserve and retained earnings).
The Group’s objectives when maintaining capital are:
 → to safeguard the entity’s ability to continue as a going concern, so that it can continue to provide returns for shareholders and 
benefits for other stakeholders; and
 → to provide an adequate return to shareholders by pricing products and services commensurately with the level of risk.
The Group has historically maintained very low levels of gearing and is not exposed to externally imposed capital requirements. The 
Group will continue to manage the amount of capital it requires in proportion to risk. The Group manages its capital structure and makes 
adjustments to it in the light of changes in economic conditions and the risk characteristics of the underlying assets.

Leasehold dilapidations relate to the estimated cost of returning a leasehold property to a defined condition at the end of the lease in 
accordance with the lease terms. Once the stage of the lease has been reached at which a reliable estimate of the costs can be made, a 
provision is recognised in the profit and loss. The main uncertainties relate to estimating the cost that will be incurred at the end of the 
lease and also whether the option to break from the lease will be exercised.
20. Deferred tax
Deferred tax is calculated in full on temporary differences under the liability method using a tax rate of 18% (2014: 20%).
The movement on the deferred tax account is as shown below:

Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset where the Group has a legally enforceable right to do so. All deferred tax has been 
recognised as the Group is consistently profitable.
The deferred taxation asset/(liability) consists of the tax effect of temporary differences as follows:

In addition to the above shares, the Company also had another class of share being an A1 Ordinary Share of £0.001 each with none 
in issue.
The Ordinary Shares and B1 Shares together (the “Equity Shares”) confer on their holders the right to receive notice of and to attend, 
speak, and vote at all general meetings of the Company and to sign written resolutions of the Company. The holders of A1 Shares were 
not entitled to receive notice of or to attend general meetings of the Company and were not entitled to vote thereat nor were they entitled 
to receive or participate in written resolutions of the Company.
Every dividend to be paid by the Company, other than a dividend payable on or following the occurrence of certain changes of control, 
will be distributed to the holders of the Equity Shares pro rata to their holdings of Equity Shares. The holders of any shares not being 
Equity Shares are not entitled to participate in or receive any dividend other than a dividend payable on or following the occurrence 
of an Event. 76
21. Share capital continued
On or following the occurrence of a change of control, the receipts from the acquirer would have been applied as follows:
(a)   firstly, to the holders of the Ordinary Shares and A1 Shares, an amount equal to £3.75 for each Ordinary Share or A1 Share held 
by them on the date of the acquisition or, if the receipts from the acquirer divided by the aggregate number of Ordinary Shares 
and A1 Shares in issue at the date of the acquisition (on a fully diluted basis) is less than £3.75, the whole of the receipts at such 
date shall be paid to the holders of the Ordinary Shares and A1 Shares pro rata to the number of Ordinary Shares and A1 Shares 
held by them;
(b)  the balance thereof (if any) shall be paid to the holders of the Equity Shares pro rata to their respective holdings of Equity Shares.
On 2 October 2014, in preparation for the flotation, the share capital of the Company underwent a four for one split. The share capital 
on 2 October 2014 was as follows:
2014

Following the share split on 2 October 2014, 3,356,528 B1 Ordinary Shares of £0.0025 each in the Company were redesignated as 
3,356,528 Ordinary Shares, subject to a payment from the Shareholder of the sum of £3.1m to the Company (being £0.9375 per B1 
Ordinary Share registered in his name).
On 6 October 2014, the holders of all the remaining issued B1 Ordinary Shares of £0.0025 in the Company voluntarily converted their B1 
Ordinary Shares into 1,726,481 Ordinary Shares and 1,717,323 Deferred Shares pursuant to the articles of association of the Company. 
The conversion rate was calculated by applying a formula based on the Placing Price to reflect the equity value of the B1 Ordinary 
Shares. 
Also on 6 October 2014, 12,000 Ordinary Shares were issued and allotted to satisfy an exercise of options which had taken place earlier 
at an exercise price of 62.5p; 608,481 Ordinary Shares were issued following the exercise of options held by certain employees pursuant 
to the 2013 Unapproved Share Option Scheme and the Unapproved Share Option Scheme. A further 256,320 Ordinary Shares were 
allotted to the SIP Trust.
On 9 October 2014, an additional 6,152 Ordinary Shares were issued at a price of £1.87.

The Deferred Shares had no voting rights and did not carry any entitlement to attend general meetings of the Company, nor were they 
admitted to trading on AIM or any other market. They did not carry any dividend rights and would only have been entitled to a payment on 
a return of capital or winding-up of the Company after each Ordinary Share had received a payment of £0.1m. They are not transferable 
without the prior written consent of the Company. 
On 20 November 2014, 202,381 Ordinary Shares were issued to satisfy options which had been exercised.

8% between the financial years at the beginning and the end of the performance period and 50% of the shares are subject to an award if the annual 
compound growth of the Company’s adjusted earnings per share exceeds or equals 20% with pro rata in between.
(c) Awards vest on 1 February 2015; there are no vesting conditions.
(d) Awards vest on 10 October 2015; there are no vesting conditions.
(e) Awards vest on 1 February 2016; there are no vesting conditions.
(f) Awards vest on 1 February 2017; there are no vesting conditions.
(g)  123,200 options over Ordinary Shares at an exercise price of £1.87 to compensate holders of options over A Ordinary Shares which were granted in 
conjunction with the issue of B shares for the loss of capital gains tax treatment in relation to the reorganisation of the share capital. These options are fully 
vested and exercisable.
The share options are subject to equity-settled share based payments.
The share options outstanding at 31 December 2015 represented 4% of the issued share capital as at that date (2014: 6%) and 
would generate additional funds of £1.1m (2014: £0.6m) if fully exercised. The weighted average remaining life of the share options 
was 16 months (2014: 20 months), with a weighted average remaining exercise price of 33p (2014: 11p).
Shadow Share Option Scheme (cash settled)
Under this scheme, the Group used to award employees with a shadow share option which vested on a change of control in the 
Company or a listing. Within 30 days of vesting (which was at the time of the listing), the employee received a payment equal to the 
number of units multiplied by the difference in market value at the date of vesting and market value at the date of grant. No awards 
were made in either period. 80
25. Share based payment continued
Share based payment expense
Equity-settled share based payments are measured at fair value (excluding the effect of market-based vesting conditions) at the date 
of grant. The fair value determined at the grant date of the equity-settled share based payments is expensed over the vesting period, 
based on the Company’s estimate of shares that will eventually vest and adjusted for the effect of non-market based vesting conditions.
Application of the fair value measurement results in a charge to operating expenses within the subsidiary company Gamma Telecom 
Limited. The charge has been made to the profit and loss account of the subsidiary as the employees’ services are provided to the 
subsidiary company. The charge for each year is as listed below:
2015

2014

Share options issued to key management 3.5 2.9
Share options issued to other employees 0.5 0.1
Modified share options in respect of key management 0.1 –
Shadow Share Options – 0.2
Total share based payment expense 4.1 3.2
Fair value is measured using the Black-Scholes model and the Monte Carlo model where market performance conditions are imposed. 
The information set out in the table below is used in the calculations. The expected life used in the model assumes that vesting conditions 
will be met and all options will be exercised at the earliest opportunity. 
2015 2014
Share price at grant date (pence) 267–284 187
Exercise price (pence) 0.25–270 0–62.5
Expected volatility 30% 30%
Risk free rate 0.97–1.405% 0.7–1.06%
Expected dividend yield 2.2% 3%
The share price at grant date and the exercise price have been adjusted for the share split.
The assumptions relating to volatility and the risk free rate are calculated with reference to other comparable companies within the 
telecommunications sector.
The Group did not enter into any share based payment transactions with parties other than employees during any of the periods. 
26. Fair value measurement of financial instruments
Financial assets and financial liabilities measured at fair value in the statement of financial position are grouped into three Levels of a fair 
value hierarchy. The three Levels are defined based on the observability of significant inputs to the measurement, as follows:
 → level 1: quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities;
 → level 2: inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly; 
and
 → level 3: unobservable inputs for the asset or liability.
The Group only had one Level 3 financial liability in the prior period, being the contingent consideration, and none in the current period.
The Group’s finance team performs valuations of financial items for financial reporting purposes, including Level 3 fair values, in 
consultation with third party valuation specialists for complex valuations. Valuation techniques are selected based on the characteristics 
of each instrument, with the overall objective of maximising the use of market-based information. The finance team reports directly to the 
Chief Financial Officer.
The valuation techniques used for instruments categorised in Level 3 are described below.
The fair value of contingent consideration related to the acquisition of Gamma Network Solutions Limited (see note 17) was based on the 
expected gross margins earned by the business in the five years following acquisition. During 2015, the remaining payment was made 
with regards to the deferred consideration and as at 31 December 2015 no further payments are due.

On 2 October 2014, the Company agreed certain arrangements with Bob Falconer to enable him to maintain his holding of 5% of the 
issued Ordinary Share capital of the Company for the purposes of enabling him to benefit from “entrepreneur’s relief” from UK capital 
gains tax. In order to achieve this, Bob Falconer agreed to pay to the Company the sum of £3.1m, being £0.9375 in respect of each of 
the 3,356,528 B1 shares held by him, such that each of his B1 shares converted into one Ordinary Share (each, a “Converted Share”). 
To part fund that payment, the Company’s subsidiary, Gamma Telecom Holdings Limited, made an interest free loan to Bob Falconer 
of £2.6m (“Loan”). If Bob Falconer ceases to be a Director of the Company the Loan is repayable on expiry of his notice period or three 
months after termination if no notice period applies. The Loan is also repayable if Bob Falconer disposes of the Converted Shares or 
upon certain events of default, including his bankruptcy or within six months of his death. There is also a part repayment obligation if 
Bob Falconer sells only part of the Converted Shares. The Loan is secured by an unregistered charge over 1,580,159 Ordinary Shares 
registered in Bob Falconer’s name. As part of these arrangements, the Company cancelled Bob Falconer’s options over 549,132 A 
shares in return for a cancellation payment to Bob Falconer of £1.6m, being equal to the capped value of the A shares pursuant to the 
terms of the Company’s articles of association in force at that time less the option exercise price for those A shares. Bob Falconer used 
part of the cancellation payment to repay a loan of £0.3m which had previously been made by Gamma Telecom Holdings Limited to him 
in April 2014.
On 6 May 2014, a subsidiary (Gamma Telecom Holdings Limited) made an interest free loan of £50,000 to Andrew Belshaw to enable 
him to repay a loan of £50,000 from the Employee Benefit Trust. This loan was repaid on 2 December 2015.
On 6 May 2014, a subsidiary (Gamma Telecom Holdings Limited) made an interest free loan of £75,000 to Richard Bligh to enable him 
to repay a loan of £75,000 from the Employee Benefit Trust. This loan was repaid on 31 March 2015. On 2 July 2014, a subsidiary 
(Gamma Telecom Limited) made an interest free loan of £250,000 to Richard Bligh. This loan was fully repaid by 3 June 2015. 
Dividends of £0.6m (2014: £Nil) were paid to Directors during the year and no dividends were payable to Directors at the year end. 
There were no other transactions with related parties during the period.

1. Accounting policies
Basis of preparation
As advised to shareholders at the AGM on 21 May 2015, the financial statements have been prepared in accordance with Financial 
Reporting Standard 100 Application of Financial Reporting Requirements and Financial Reporting Standard 101 Reduced Disclosure 
Framework. 
The principal accounting policies adopted in the preparation of the financial statements are set out below. The policies have been 
consistently applied to all the years presented, unless otherwise stated.
The financial statements have been prepared on a historical cost basis, except for the revaluation of certain properties and financial 
instruments. The presentation currency used is sterling and amounts have been presented in round millions (“£m”).
The accounts are prepared on the going concern basis. In assessing whether the going concern assumption is appropriate, the Directors 
have taken into account all relevant available information about the future trading including profit and cash forecasts and available 
facilities and funding. It is therefore considered appropriate to adopt the going concern basis of accounting in the preparation of the 
annual financial statements.
As a consolidated profit and loss account is published, a separate profit and loss account for the parent company is omitted from the 
Group financial statements by the virtue of section 408 of the Companies Act 2006. The profit in respect of the Company for the year 
was £14.8m (2014: £14.9m).
Disclosure exemptions adopted
In preparing these financial statements the Company has taken advantage of all disclosure exemptions conferred by FRS 101. Therefore 
these financial statements do not include:
 → certain disclosures regarding the Company’s capital;
 → a statement of cash flows;
 → the effect of future accounting standards not yet adopted;
 → the disclosure of the remuneration of key management personnel; and
 → disclosure of related party transactions with other wholly owned members of the Group headed by Gamma Communications plc.
Investments
Investments are recorded at cost less amounts written off. The cost of acquisition is the amount of cash or cash equivalents paid and the 
fair value of other purchase consideration given by the acquirer, together with the expenses of the acquisition. Where the payment of 
consideration for an acquisition is to be made after the date of acquisition, reasonable estimates of the amounts expected to be paid are 
included in the cost of acquisition at their present values. The cost of acquisition is adjusted when revised estimates are made, with 
consequential corresponding adjustments continuing to be made to the cost of the investment, and therefore goodwill, until the ultimate 
amount is known.
Financial liabilities and equity
Financial liabilities and equity instruments are classified according to the substance of the contractual arrangements entered into.
An equity instrument is any contract that evidences a residual interest in the assets of the entity after deducting all of its financial liabilities.
Dividends and distributions relating to equity instruments are debited direct to equity.

This is the first year that the Company has presented its financial statements under FRS 101 (Financial Reporting Standard 101) issued

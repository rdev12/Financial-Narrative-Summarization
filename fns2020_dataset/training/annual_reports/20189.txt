Chairman’s Statement > Eric Peacock 
“Demand for our services remains strong and the level of
interest in our new products, both retail and commercial, 
is encouraging.”
This advance was strengthened shortly
after the year end with the Group’s listing
on AIM on 15 April 2004 when we raised
£1.3 million (after expenses). These 
funds are being used to provide working
capital and support for two new initiatives
targeted at the business finance and
insurance markets. 
Performance
Gross turnover for the 12 months to 
31 March 2004 was £319.2 million
generating a gross profit of £2.9 million.
This represents an increase in gross profit
of 55% over the 2003 result. Margins
improved from 0.73% to 0.81% in our
core currencies business while the Group
profit on ordinary activities before tax of
£298,000 was a rise of 176% on the
previous year. This result was slightly
ahead of the forecast for profit before 
tax of £290,000 issued at the time of the
AIM listing and placing. The Group has
ample cash resources to fund its planned
activities. The move to AIM gives the
Group increased visibility and raises its
profile with investors and in its industry
sector, while also helping to build a
broader shareholder base and greater
liquidity in the stock.
Prior Period Adjustment
The accounts include a prior period
adjustment to correct understatements 
of trade debtors and trade creditors
contained in the balance sheet at 
31 March 2002. The effect on net
assets is £232,000 after taxation. 
Introduction
The year under review has been very
successful for The 4Less Group plc.
Business volumes grew strongly while the
Group took significant steps to further
develop its position as one of the leading
providers of foreign exchange and other
financial services to retail and corporate
clients both in the UK and overseas.  05 The 4Less Group plc Annual Report & Accounts 2004
“I have been greatly impressed by the quality and
professionalism demonstrated by staff at all levels.”
The net assets at 31 March 2004,
adjusted for the net proceeds of the
flotation and the prior period adjustment
are £1.7 million. The understatements
relate wholly to the two years ended 
31 March 2002, the first two years of
trading. Since 31 March 2002, the
Group’s management and its financial
and accounting systems have been
significantly strengthened and we are
satisfied that the Group’s systems and
internal controls are robust. 
Board
In October 2003, the Board was
strengthened through the appointment 
of Greg Begley as Chief Operating Officer
and Nigel Paul as Finance Director who
both have many years of experience in
banking and finance. I joined the Board in
March 2004, prior to the move to AIM.
People
The number of people in the Group has
grown significantly during the year. I have
been greatly impressed by the quality and
professionalism demonstrated by staff
at all levels. The Group places strong
emphasis on training and is committed
to the on-going development of its staff.
I would like to thank everyone associated
with the Group for their commitment, hard
work and above all, enthusiasm. 
Outlook
The year has started well; demand for our
services remains strong and the level of
interest in our new products, both retail
and commercial, is encouraging. Trading
conditions in our key markets are buoyant
and we look forward with confidence.

Chief Executive Officer’s Review > Charles McLeod
“The Group has come a long way in a short time. The management
team is determined to continue to grow the business in a controlled
manner without curbing the entrepreneurial drive and enthusiasm,
which is so important in a fast developing operation.” 
Introduction
The year to 31 March 2004 has been
productive in terms of business
performance and also seen considerable
change as we have taken major steps 
in positioning the Group for future
development.
We continued to broaden our customer
base with new client registrations
increasing by 37% over the year. Our
Spanish office directly serves the
extensive and important business
relationships we have in that country. 
The management team was
strengthened in October 2003 by the
appointment of Greg Begley as Chief
Operating Officer and Nigel Paul as
Finance Director. Immediately following
the year under review the Group moved
its listing from OFEX to AIM, raising 
£1.7 million gross (£1.3 million net) for the
purposes of developing the infrastructure
of the Group, expanding the existing
operations especially into the corporate
arena, and to support increased foreign
exchange lines with our bankers.
A key part of the development of the
infrastructure of the Group has been 
our commitment to regulation and
compliance with Anti Money Laundering
and Proceeds of Crime legislation. We
continue to develop our internal control
and client registration systems, and 
work closely with external specialist
consultants to ensure staff are aware of
the changing legislation and adequately
trained. We have also expanded our
back office infrastructure in line with
the growth in the number of foreign
currency transactions. 
Our Property Finance division is now 
FSA authorised to conduct mortgage
business, and FLG Insurance Brokers
Limited, our insurance subsidiary is a
member of the General Insurance
Standards Council and has completed
the process of applying for FSA
registration which comes into force 
in January 2005.
We constantly listen to the requirements
of our clients and as a result of great
demand we have created International
Equity Release. This product, which is
available from banks in France, Portugal
and Spain, will allow UK residents with
unencumbered properties in these
countries to take out Euro mortgages
secured on their overseas property. 
At present this facility is not generally
available in these countries and is only
available through PropertyFinance4Less.
With over one million UK nationals
owning properties in Europe and this
number is expected to grow by a further
two million over the next five years, the
prospects for the business are good.
We have developed the infrastructure 
and recruited high calibre staff for our
new FLG Corporate Services division
which acting as broker, assists in
arranging bespoke trade and asset
finance products from a wide range 
of financial institutions. This business 
is now ready to formally launch its
products and services. 07 The 4Less Group plc Annual Report & Accounts 2004
Trading Review
The Group continued to develop its
trading base during the year. The major
contributors were our foreign currency
and overseas mortgages divisions. The
referrals now coming through the overseas
mortgage division have led to the Group
setting up an insurance broking operation
to service the substantial demand for
insurance cover for overseas properties.
The Group commenced trading in March
2000 as a foreign currency exchange
service providing an alternative to the 
UK Clearing Banks, whose high charges
and low levels of customer support had
just been severely criticised in the
Cruickshank Report. Today in addition 
to currency services the Group provides
a range of lending and insurance
products for the consumer and business
market. The Group’s rapid growth has
resulted from focusing on outstanding
customer service backed by people with
the requisite skills to fulfil our clients’
needs. We do not take principal risk on
any of our lending products or facilitate
speculative currency transactions. The
number of fully registered customers has
grown through personal recommendation,
targeted marketing and innovative use of
the internet. This has been further boosted
by reciprocal referral relationships with
overseas property agents and a number
of UK-based car dealerships. The client
base is now in excess of 20,000.
Satisfied customers are our greatest
asset and most effective advertisement.
We are encouraged that over 30% of our
business comes from recommendations
or referrals. Our large customer base 
of high net worth individuals expect
excellence and we are constantly looking
at ways of developing new products
which we believe they will find attractive. 
Currencies4Less is our principal business
activity and accounted for over 99.8% 
of Group sales and profit in the year
under review. We expect this business 
to continue to grow strongly although as
a proportion of the whole Group it will
gradually reduce as the other businesses,
including the new corporate operations,
become more established.
PropertyFinance4Less had a good 
year boosted by the continuing strong
demand from UK citizens for homes
overseas. There are now over one million
UK nationals owning property abroad,
principally in France, Italy, Portugal and
Spain and demand in other countries,
including the USA, is also buoyant. This
trend is expected to continue and we can
now benefit significantly from the high level
of requests we have received for insurance
cover through our newly established FLG
Insurance Brokers subsidiary.
Car-Finance4Less was formed to arrange
financing for clients wishing to purchase
cars abroad. However as the financial
benefit of importing cars has gradually
diminished, this business now focuses 
on building referral relationships with the
larger independent dealerships who
operate mainly in the quality brands market.
The business is making steady progress
in offering competitive financial products
aimed at higher value cars for personal use.
FLG Insurance Brokers has recently
commenced trading. We are excited
about the prospects for this business
whose products span both the consumer
and corporate markets. The business
provides a range of insurance products
for property owners overseas including
house and contents insurance, mortgage
linked life/protection assurance, critical
illness, health and travel insurance. It also
provides corporate customers with credit
insurance, bonds, liability insurance and
personal indemnity cover. Early signs 
are encouraging and with the additional
benefit of annual renewal premiums, the
outlook for the business is positive and 
it should provide a stable and growing
income stream to the Group.
FLG Corporate Services has also 
only recently commenced trading. This
division provides financial services to
business customers requiring customised
funding packages to support their
existing trading activities and growth
ambitions. The division will arrange asset
and trade finance facilities and 
debt financing, with particular emphasis
on companies with a turnover broadly 
in the range £1 million to £100 million. 
Our Corporate Services team has long
experience in this market and over the
years has built a wide network of
business contacts and commercial
relationships. We are excited by the
opportunities in this market and are
particularly encouraged by our discussions
with the larger financial institutions that
provide the financing to our clients. It is
early days but the feedback we have
received suggests that this business has
a bright future. 
Corporate Identity
We have recently introduced a new
corporate identity and have redesigned
our Group web site in order to provide
more information for investors and others
interested in our Company. This new
style will be adopted Group wide. 
Looking Forward
The Group has come a long way in a
short time. The management team is
determined to continue to grow the
business in a controlled manner without
curbing the entrepreneurial drive and
enthusiasm, which is so important in a
fast developing operation. Looking to the
future we aim to reinforce our strong
organic growth with acquisitions that
support and complement our existing
businesses. We are proud of what has
been achieved but not complacent about
the challenges that lie ahead.

Directors’ Responsibilities for the Financial Statements
United Kingdom company law requires the Directors to prepare financial statements for each financial year which give a true and
fair view of the state of affairs of the Company and the Group and of the profit or loss of the Group for that period. In preparing
those financial statements the Directors are required to:
> select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently;
> make judgements and estimates that are reasonable and prudent;
> state whether applicable accounting standards have been followed, subject to any material departures disclosed and explained
in the financial statements; and 
> prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis unless it is inappropriate to presume that the Company will
continue in business.
The Directors are responsible for maintaining proper accounting records, for safeguarding the assets of the Group and for taking
reasonable steps for the prevention and detection of fraud and other irregularities.
The Directors are responsible for ensuring that the Report of the Directors and other information included in the Annual Report is
prepared in accordance with company law in the United Kingdom.
10 The 4Less Group plc Annual Report & Accounts 2004 The maintenance and integrity of The 4Less Group Plc web site is the responsibility of the directors; the work carried out by the
auditors does not involve consideration of these matters and, accordingly, the auditors accept no responsibility for any changes
that may have occurred to the financial statements since they were initially presented on the web site. 
Legislation in the United Kingdom governing the preparation and dissemination of the financial statements and other information
included in annual reports may differ from legislation in other jurisdictions.
Payment Policy
The policy for the Group is to agree the terms of payment with suppliers on an individual basis at the time of entering the
transaction. At the year end trade creditors were on average 25 days (2003: 24 days).
Transition to International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS)
The Group is in the process of preparing to convert to IFRS in time for application to the 2006 results. A project team has been
established to identify the effects of differences between UK GAAP and IFRS. This process is currently ongoing and will continue
as new standards and amendments to existing standards evolve. During the year ending 31 March 2005 the Group will begin to
run a separate internal IFRS financial reporting consolidation.
Disabled Employees
Applications for employment by disabled persons are fully considered, bearing in mind the aptitudes of the applicant concerned. In
the event of members of staff becoming disabled, every effort is made to ensure that their employment with the Group continues
and that appropriate training is arranged. It is the policy of the Group that the training, career development and promotion of
disabled persons should, as far as possible, be identical to that of other employees.
Employee Information and Consultation
The Group continues to involve its staff in the future development of the business. Information is provided to employees by regular
briefing meetings. 
The Group operates a Group Stakeholder Pension Plan available to all employees.
Going Concern
After making enquiries, the Directors have formed a judgement that there is reasonable expectation that the Group has adequate
resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future. For this reason, the Directors continue to adopt the going
concern basis in preparing the financial statements.
Post Balance Sheet Events
On 15 April 2004, the Company floated and was admitted to AIM and raised £1.7m (before expenses) via the issue of 2,833,333
ordinary shares of 1p each at a price of 60p each. Further details are provided in Note 17.
Auditors
PKF offer themselves for reappointment as auditors in accordance with section 385 of the Companies Act 1985.

11 The 4Less Group plc Annual Report & Accounts 2004 Corporate Governance Statement
Year ended 31 March 2004
Introduction
The Board of The 4Less Group plc is committed to achieving good standards of corporate governance, integrity and business
ethics for all activities. Under the rules of AIM, the Group is not required to comply with the Combined Code. However, the Group
has taken steps to comply with the Combined Code in so far as it can be applied practically, given the size of the Group and the
nature of its operations.
Audit Committee
The Audit Committee consists of the non-executive Directors with Eric Peacock as Chairman. The committee will meet at least
twice a year, linked to the timing of the publication of the Group’s results. The committee will also meet on an ad hoc basis when
necessary. The external auditors may also be invited to attend these meetings.
The committee operates within specific terms of reference which include: 
> considering the appointment of external and internal auditors;
> reviewing the relationship with external auditors;
> reviewing the financial reporting and internal control procedures;
> reviewing the management of financial matters and focusing upon the independence and objectivity of the external auditors; and
> reviewing the consistency of accounting policies both on a year to year basis and across the Group.
Remuneration Committee
The Remuneration Committee consists of the non-executive Directors with Eric Peacock as Chairman.
The Chief Executive Officer of the Company, Charles McLeod, may also be invited to attend certain meetings of the Remuneration
Committee.
Role of the Remuneration Committee
The Remuneration Committee reviews and determines on behalf of the Board and shareholders of the Company the pay, benefits
and other terms of service of the executive Directors of the Company and the broad pay strategy with respect to senior Company
employees.
Transitional Period and Establishment of the Remuneration Committee
The Company became an AIM-listed company on 15 April 2004. In view of this timing the Remuneration Committee has
considered the remuneration policy for the current year.
Best Practice
As the Company is AIM-listed, the Company is not legally required to set out its remuneration policy but is doing so on a voluntary
basis. To the extent that such principles are relevant to the current circumstances of the Company, the provisions of inter alia the
Directors’ Remuneration Report Regulations 2002 and the Combined Code are taken into account. 
Remuneration Policy
The objective of the Company’s remuneration policy is to provide remuneration in a form and amount to attract, retain and motivate
high quality management.
The remuneration policy of the Company has four principal components:
Basic Salaries
Basic Salaries are determined by the Remuneration Committee bearing in mind the salaries paid in AIM-listed and other similar
companies. Within that frame of reference, it is intended that pay should be at the mid-market rate.
12 The 4Less Group plc Annual Report & Accounts 2004 Bonuses 
Bonuses are payable according to the achievement by the Company of certain pre-determined Company targets including
earnings and development milestones. The level of bonuses payable on achievement of the targets is set at the level to provide 
the necessary incentives for executive Directors and senior managers. There are appropriate adjustments to the bonus payable 
in the event of over or under-achievement of the Company against those targets. 
Share Option Scheme 
At the Annual General Meeting held on 27 February 2004, shareholders approved the creation of The 4Less Group plc 2004
Enterprise Management Incentive Plan (‘the EMI Plan’).
The EMI Plan will be operated by the Board (acting where appropriate, through the Remuneration Committee). Options granted
under the EMI Plan should qualify for favourable tax treatment provided various conditions set out in the Income Tax (Earnings 
and Pensions) Act 2003 are met.
Any employee or Director of the Group who works at least 25 hours per week for the Group or who spends at least 75 per cent 
of his working time for the Group will be eligible to participate in the EMI Plan at the discretion of the Board.
Employee Benefit Trust 
At the Annual General Meeting held on 27 February 2004 shareholder approval was obtained for the creation of The 4Less Group
2004 Employee Settlement (‘the EBT’).
The EBT is a discretionary trust capable of benefiting all employees and former employees of the Company and its subsidiaries
and certain of their dependants. The trustees are Dominion Employment Benefit Trustees Limited based in Jersey. The trustees 
of the EBT are entirely independent of the Company. The Company cannot give any instructions to the trustees but can make
recommendations to them.
The Company has made an initial contribution of £100 to the trustees and may make further contributions to the trustees from

13 The 4Less Group plc Annual Report & Accounts 2004 Independent Auditors’ Report to the Members 
of The 4Less Group plc
Year ended 31 March 2004
We have audited the financial statements of The 4Less Group plc for the year ended 31 March 2004 which comprise the
Consolidated Profit and Loss Account, the Consolidated Balance Sheet, the Company Balance Sheet, the Consolidated Cash
Flow Statement, the Consolidated Statement of Total Recognised Gains and Losses and the related notes. These financial
statements have been prepared under the accounting policies set out therein.
This report is made solely to the Company's members, as a body, in accordance with Section 235 of the Companies Act 1985.
Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might state to the Company's members those matters we are required to state 
to them in an auditors' report and for no other purpose. To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume
responsibility to anyone other than the Company and the Company's members as a body, for our audit work, for this report, 
or for the opinions we have formed.
Respective Responsibilities of Directors and Auditors
The Directors' responsibilities for preparing the Annual Report and the financial statements in accordance with applicable law 
and United Kingdom Accounting Standards are set out in the Report of the Directors.
Our responsibility is to audit the financial statements in accordance with relevant legal and regulatory requirements and United
Kingdom Auditing Standards. 
We report to you our opinion as to whether the financial statements give a true and fair view and are properly prepared in
accordance with the Companies Act 1985. We also report to you if, in our opinion, the Report of the Directors is not consistent
with the financial statements, if the Company has not kept proper accounting records, if we have not received all the information
and explanations we require for our audit, or if information specified by law regarding Directors' remuneration and transactions 
with the Company and other members of the Group is not disclosed.
We read other information contained in the Annual Report and consider whether it is consistent with the audited financial statements.
This other information comprises only the Report of the Directors, the Chairman's Statement, the Chief Executive Officer’s Review
and the Corporate Governance Statement. We consider the implications for our report if we become aware of any apparent
misstatements or material inconsistencies with the financial statements. Our responsibilities do not extend to any other information.
Basis of Audit Opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with United Kingdom Auditing Standards issued by the Auditing Practices Board. An audit
includes examination, on a test basis, of evidence relevant to the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. It also
includes an assessment of the significant estimates and judgments made by the Directors in the preparation of the financial
statements, and of whether the accounting policies are appropriate in the Group’s circumstances, consistently applied and
adequately disclosed.
We planned and performed our audit so as to obtain all the information and explanations which we considered necessary in 
order to provide us with sufficient evidence to give reasonable assurance that the financial statements are free from material
misstatement, whether caused by fraud or other irregularity or error. In forming our opinion we also evaluated the overall adequacy
of the presentation of information in the financial statements.
Opinion
In our opinion the financial statements give a true and fair view of the state of the Group's and the Company's affairs as at 
31 March 2004 and of the Group's profit for the year then ended and have been properly prepared in accordance with the
Companies Act 1985.

Year ended 31 March 2004
1 Accounting Policies
(a) Basis of preparation of financial statements
The financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention and in accordance with applicable 
accounting standards.
The consolidated financial statements comprise the audited financial statements of the Company and its subsidiary undertakings
made up to 31 March 2004. The results of subsidiaries acquired are consolidated from the date on which control passed.
Acquisitions are accounted for under the acquisition method.
A separate profit and loss account for the parent company has not been prepared as permitted by Section 230(2) of the
Companies Act 1985. The profit after tax for the financial period of the parent company was £229,071 (2003 – £92,483).
(b) Turnover and revenue recognition
Turnover represents:
1. The gross value of foreign exchange currency transactions undertaken by the Group’s foreign currency business. Purchases 
of currency relating to such transactions are treated as cost of sales.
Turnover is recognised after receiving the client’s written authorisation. Where the Group enters into contracts with its clients, 
it also enters into separate matched forward contracts with its bankers.
2. Commissions earned from arranging property and car finance. Such revenue is recognised when the client has entered into
irrevocable arrangements with the loan provider.
(c) Forward delivery contracts and monies due from clients
The Company has the right to insist on net settlement. Accordingly, trade debtors represent the net balance due to the Group.
Where funds have been received from clients in advance, the Group’s liability to them is included in trade creditors.
This represents a change in accounting policy to more accurately reflect the nature of the transactions undertaken by the Group
and has had no impact on the profit and loss account. See notes 16 and 23. The previous accounting policy was to include the
gross amounts owing from and to clients within trade debtors and trade creditors respectively.
(d) Tangible fixed assets
Tangible fixed assets are stated at cost less depreciation. Depreciation is provided at rates calculated to write off the cost of fixed
assets, less their estimated residual value, over their expected useful lives on the following bases:
Motor vehicles 33%
Office equipment 33%
Leasehold improvements Over the life of the lease
(e) Operating leases
Operating lease rentals are charged in the profit and loss account on a straight line basis over the lease term.
(f) Investments
Investments are stated at cost less provision for impairment.
(g) Financial instruments
The only financial instruments utilised by the Group are spot and fixed and open forward exchange contracts to match customers’
specific requirements. The Group does not enter into speculative contracts on its own account.
(h) Foreign currencies
Assets and liabilities in foreign currencies are translated into sterling at the rates of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date or, 
if matched, at the forward contract rate. Transactions in foreign currencies are translated into sterling at the rate ruling on the date
of the transaction or, if matched, at the forward contract rate. Exchange differences are taken into account in arriving at the
operating profit.
(i) Deferred taxation
In accordance with FRS19 full provision is made at current rates for taxation deferred in respect of all timing differences. Deferred
tax balances are not discounted. Deferred tax assets are only recognised where they arise from timing differences where their
recoverability is regarded as more likely than not.

15 Financial Instruments
Treasury activities take place under procedures and policies monitored by the Board. They are designed to minimise the financial
risks faced by the Group which primarily arise from interest rate, currency and liquidity risks and information is given below. As
permitted by FRS 13 no further details are set out in respect of short-term debtors and creditors.
Interest rate risks
The Group has financed its operations primarily through the issue of equity shares and retained profit. Floating rate assets
comprise cash at bank and the Group receives interest on cash balances at rates linked to the Group’s banker base rate. The
Group has no significant borrowings. The Group has no other assets or liabilities that are subject to interest rate fluctuations.
Liquidity risk
The Group’s treasury management policies are designed to ensure the continuity of funding. The Group has significant surplus
cash at the period end.
Foreign currency risk
The Group does not have any significant foreign currency exposure as all foreign currency is acquired under matched contracts 
to fulfil contracts with customers and therefore no further analysis is required under FRS 13.
16 Forward Delivery Contracts and Monies Due from Clients
At the year end, the amount due from clients in respect of open contracts was £13,680,180 (2003: £13,402,307).
At the year end, the Group had committed to purchase currency at fixed rates from its bankers, in respect of clients, amounting 
to £16,081,319 (2003: £14,565,570).

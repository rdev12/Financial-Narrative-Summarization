‘‘
2 UK Mail performed strongly in the year to March 2014.  Financial
highlights for the year include;
Group revenues up 7.0%
Group PBT up 28.2%
EPS up 29.6%, and
Final dividend increased 14.5% to 14.2p per share 
Strategy
Our strategy is to grow our revenue and profit margins by establishing a
market leading position in our key markets of parcels, mail and courier
services, with a clear focus on network efficiency together with product and
service innovation.
As you will read later in this report, imail, ipost parcels, packets and retail
logistics all product innovations of the last few years, are gaining real
traction now, delivering real returns for the business.
Our strategic investments are now coming together as we have clarity
following the agreement we reached to relocate our Birmingham hub as a
result of the HS2 link. In December 2013 we reached contractual agreement
with the Secretary of State for Transport and have since commenced
construction of a new enlarged and largely automated national hub near
Coventry, which we anticipate will be fully operational by September 2015.
Our investment in IT continues at pace as we build the infrastructure
necessary to create the future platforms for growth. Our management teams
have again been strengthened during the year, not only with a number of
new appointments, but through continued training throughout the business.
These investments will provide us with the necessary platform to achieve
significant operating efficiencies and continued volume growth over the
years ahead. 
In April 2014, I was delighted to welcome Carl Moore to the Board as Group
Operations director. Carl has been with the company since 2007 and his
contribution to the improvements made in our network efficiency, are
demonstrably clear in the results I am pleased to announce today.
Dividend
The Board has proposed an increase in the final dividend of 1.8p, taking the
final dividend to 14.2p (2013:  12.4p), resulting in a total dividend for the
year of 21.3p (2013: 18.8p).
This represents a full year increase of 13.3%.
The total dividend for the year is covered 1.50 times by earnings (2013:
1.31 times), which the Board considers to be at an appropriate level for our
business.
People
One of the characteristics of our business that has struck me is the ability
to get things done which I see from our colleagues across the business, day
in day out. 
The results this year are testament to the success this approach yields.
On behalf of the Board I would like to thank all of our colleagues, and our
associates working within our franchise and pallet networks for their
continued hard work and commitment in providing this great service to our
customers.  
Outlook
I remain confident in our strategy and believe that the Group is well
positioned to take advantage of opportunities as they arise.
We have now entered a new phase of significant strategic investment which
will set us up well for the next stage of profitable growth, with the benefits
expected to be seen from 2015 onwards.
With the strength of our market positions, a well-invested integrated and
automated network, and a growing suite of innovative and industry leading
products and services, I am excited by the medium term growth prospects
for UK Mail.
Thank you again for your continued support.
Peter Kane, Chairman
I am excited by the medium term growth 
prospects for UK Mail.

3 How we do it
UK Mail Report & Accounts 2014       
Our customers and markets
Our customers range from the largest banks, supermarkets,
telecommunication businesses, and government, through to
mid-range and small independent companies and sole
traders. Key to our business model is the development of
new products and services expanding the markets available
to us and increasing our share of those markets we are
already in, whilst delivering the same high level, efficient
service to our customers.
Our infrastructure
With over 30 years experience in parcel, mail and 
logistics services and with our extensive network of 
52 sites, 2,800 staff, 2,206 vehicles including the sub-
contractor fleet, nationwide mail sortation machines and
automation, this enables us to provide industry leading
service on a cost efficient basis.
Our people
Our people have the support, training and confidence to
respond and enhance the customer experience. 
We encourage our people to be passionate, innovative, and
empower them to make decisions. We develop our people with
training both internally and externally. Our people know what is
right for our company and customers due to the training we
undertake and the tools we provide for the job.

These are sorted overnight into their destinations at our sort centres, largely at our
central hub. Mail items are then delivered the next day to one of 38 Royal Mail
centres for final delivery. Parcels are delivered to businesses and residential
locations across the UK. We use advanced technology to track all these items
through our network to their destinations, providing customers with sophisticated
reporting of delivery performance.

of the business.
Chief Executive’s Statement

UK Mail Report & Accounts 2014          Strategic Report
These results reflect an excellent year for UK Mail, with increased revenues and
strong margin progression.  We have also achieved profitable growth across all
areas of the business.  Such a robust performance shows that we have
accomplished almost all that we set out to achieve through the programme of
investment and change over recent years.
We continue to benefit from our strong market positions across our business
thanks to our efficient integrated network and high service levels.  During March
2014 we experienced the highest ever daily volumes across our combined
parcels and mail businesses; given the Group’s continued focus on network
management we maintained our strong customer service levels.
Reported Group revenues for the year at £508.5m were up 7.0% compared to the
previous year.  Adjusting for there being four extra working days than in the
previous year, underlying Group revenues increased by 5.3%.  Group profit
before tax increased by 28.2% on the previous year to £22.8m. We estimate that
each extra working day equates to some £0.5m of contribution.  Adjusting for
this factor the underlying increase in profit before tax was some 17.0%.
Our Parcels business (43% of group revenues) continued to deliver a good
performance, with high volumes throughout the year, leading to an increase in
market share and a double-digit operating margin of 10.2% (2013: 8.6%). This
volume growth was partly driven by an increase in home deliveries related to
online shopping, with a continuation of the mix change towards B2C that we
have previously seen.  Revenues grew by 16.2% to £219.9m (2013: £189.3m)
and operating profit grew strongly by 37.2% to £22.4m (2013: £16.3m) as we
continued to focus on innovation and operational efficiency to help drive margin
improvement.
Our Mail business (48% of group revenues) showed a 1.5% increase in revenues
for the year alongside a positive uplift in volumes, driven by strong customer
retention and new business wins. Our mail volumes increased by some 2.0%
compared to the prior year, while the overall UK mail market has seen a decline
in transactional volumes of some 5% per annum in recent years. Operating profit
increased by 18.0% to £12.7m (2013:  £10.7m) and the operating margin
increased to 5.2% (2013: 4.4%).  Our Mail business remains well positioned in
its market with a healthy pipeline of new business opportunities.  We again saw
good progress from imail and other new product innovations.
Our Courier business (3% of group revenues) saw an improving trend of revenue
throughout the year, however for the full year revenues declined by 1.9%. Strong
operational management reduced operating costs, helping to increase the operating
margin to 17.0% for the period (2013: 15.5%), leading to 7.2% growth in operating
profit to £2.7m (2013: £2.6m).
In our Pallets business (6% of group revenues) revenues declined by 3.2%, however
operating profit increased by 18.8% to £0.9m (2013:  £0.8m).
The move of our head office and national hub to a newly constructed site in 2015
will be a major change for our business.  The new automated hub will be a
significant major step forward in how we operate, creating extra capacity and
reducing operating costs. The move however will create challenges as we relocate
with a key objective being to retain the knowledge and experience of our teams. We
have instigated a programme to manage this change which will involve substantial
engagement with our staff.
Our cash generation and financial position remains strong with net cash balances
at the period end of £27.0m (2013:  £27.0m).

Strategy
STRATEGY
Our strategy is to grow our revenue and margins by establishing a market leading
position in our key markets of parcels, mail and courier services, with a clear focus
on network efficiency together with product and service innovation.
Network Efficiency
A low cost, efficient network with high service levels is key to our market position.
This allows us to win and retain contracts at good profit levels in a market which
continues to be very competitive.
The key factors in achieving this objective are:
An Integrated Network for our Parcels, Mail and Courier Businesses
This integration allows us to spread the fixed costs of our operation and drive
operational benefits.  The integrated nature of our network, which is unique in the
UK, also allows us to offer services our competitors cannot match.  We have
continued to progress this objective in the current year with further integration of
our Courier network providing enhanced delivery facilities for customers.
Extensive and innovative use of I.T.
In our industry I.T. is a key differentiator.  We handle some 200,000 parcels each
night together with some 11.5m mail items.  The ability to track the progress of
these items through our network and to provide customers with information on this
progress is vital, as is the provision of sophisticated solutions centred on the end-
consumer experience.
In the year we have continued to invest in our I.T. infrastructure, increasing
capacity and resilience.  We have also introduced new data services and
information to the end-customer.  The key change here has been the introduction
of one-hour delivery windows, which puts us alongside the industry leaders in our
market.
Strong Operational Management
The organisation and management of our network is vital to achieving the
consistently high operational levels we achieve.  This comes down to operating
disciplines and cost control.
We believe we excel in this area and continue to introduce improvements to help
drive down our operating costs whilst improving service levels.
As a reflection of the importance of strong operational management to the Group’s
success, Carl Moore, our Group Operations Director, was promoted to the Board
with effect from 8th April 2014.  With his strong operational focus, wide-reaching
experience of parcel distribution networks and of the implementation of automated
parcel sortation operations, he is a  valuable addition to the Board.
Automation
Effective use of automated sortation is vital in our industry, to further reduce
sortation costs and to increase capacity.  Having partially automated our
operations in 2010, we now handle some 20% of our Parcels volumes through
these automated facilities.
We intend to increase the level of automated sortation to some 80% of our Parcels
volumes, the maximum we believe our business can achieve at this stage, due to
the consignments we handle not all being compatible with automated sortation.
As previously announced, this will involve the installation of further automated
sortation equipment, at a capital cost of approximately £20m of which some
£3.3m has been incurred in the financial year just finished with the balance to be
incurred in the new financial year.  We are targeting a double digit net return on
the automation investment we make and the full run rate of benefits from
September 2015.
We estimate that this increased automation of our parcels operations will increase
our central sortation capacity by some 45%.

Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements We are pleased with the
performance we have delivered
for the year.
We expect construction of our new hub to be completed in late
2014, with the hub fully operational from mid-2015.
Strategy
Network Capacity/New Hub
Growing network capacity is vital in a market that continues to show strong growth,
largely due to the rapid growth of internet shopping.  We aim to achieve this
capacity growth through localised expansion of capacity where needed, together
with the expansion of our central hub.  The expansion of our central hub is overdue
and was delayed due to the uncertainty caused by the relocation of our
Birmingham hub as a result of the HS2 rail link.
This position was resolved in December 2013, and our new hub is under
construction at a site near Coventry.  This new hub, together with increased
automation, is key to our future growth plans.  We expect construction to be
completed in late 2014, with the hub being fully operational from mid-2015. 
Product and Service Innovation
The second key factor in our strategy is product and service innovation.  We are
focussed on continuing to expand the size of the markets available to us and on
increasing our share of these markets.  To do so we have introduced new and
innovative products and services in both our Parcels and our Mail businesses.
This strategy is gaining valuable traction helping us to win new customers.
The key areas we are progressing are:
imail – a market leading hybrid mail service
imailprint – an internet based printing service, linked to imail, that can meet
localised printing requirements
ipostparcels – a leading parcels collection and delivery service targeting the
internet end customer/small businesses
Retail Logistics – a parcel delivery service targeting the needs of retail
businesses
Packets – a packet collection and delivery service providing cost effective
solutions in conjunction with Royal Mail’s delivery service
istore – a localised storage and delivery service targeting local repair engineer
services that need fast access locally to parts and components
More details are provided on the progress of these initiatives in the following
review.
Strategy Summary 
Over the past three years, excellent progress has been made in developing the
business to its current position, with a clear focus on network efficiency and
product innovation. The result is a robust operational platform and strong
competitive positions in our chosen markets.  The new products that we have
introduced have gained valuable traction, and we have become a significantly
more consumer-focused business.  The benefits can be seen in the strong results
we have achieved.
As previously announced, we are now entering the next phase of strategic
investment, targeting significant improvements in our capacity, customer-facing
technology, IT infrastructure and automation.  Combined, these will create the
platform for the next chapter of growth over the coming years.

10 We have achieved strong volume growth in both the B2B and
B2C market segments throughout the period, with Parcels
average daily volumes increasing by some 19% compared to
last year.
Divisional review
Parcels
Revenues in Parcels, which comprises the Group’s business-to-business (B2B), business-to-
consumer (B2C) and international parcel delivery service, were up 16.2% to £219.9m (2013:
£189.3m). On an adjusted basis, taking account of the four extra days compared to last year,
they increased by some 14.2%.
We have achieved strong volume growth in both the B2B and B2C market segments
throughout the period, with Parcels average daily volumes increasing by some 19% compared
to last year.  This performance is driven by good customer retention and a number of high
quality customer wins.  We continue to see an on-going volume mix change towards the lower
margin B2C segment.
The strong volume growth allows us to spread our fixed costs across the increased volumes
and so improve our operating margins.  As a result, despite the continued competitive pricing
environment, we have improved our Parcels operating margin to 10.2% for the year (2013:
8.6%).  
The good growth in revenues combined with the operating margin increase has led to a strong
growth in the Parcels operating profit of 37.2% to £22.4m (2013: £16.3m).  On an adjusted
basis, taking account of the additional working days, operating profit grew by some 27.5%.  
We continue to make progress with our specialised Retail Logistics product, which provides
services tailored to the specific needs of retailers, with a special capability to handle hanging
garments.  Following the opening of our specialist distribution centre in July 2013, we have
now introduced automated sortation capabilities for hanging garments as well as improved
software which allows us seamlessly to combine our Parcels and Courier networks, providing
a more flexible, integrated product for our customers.
ipostparcels represents one of the lowest-cost and most user-friendly online collection and
delivery services available in the UK. While growth slowed slightly year on year as the
business becomes more established among our target customer base, 2013 Christmas
volumes were double those achieved in the previous year. 
The overall UK parcels market is growing rapidly but remains highly competitive.  While we
experienced the usual mix of contract changes over the period, we continue to be successful
in winning new customers as a result of our high service levels, low-cost network, our strong
brand, and dislocation elsewhere in the market. To allow us to handle these increasing
volumes we continue to expand our capacity, with three sites in our fifty-strong network having
been expanded during the period and up to eight additional sites earmarked for expansion in
the next 12 months. 
Key to our parcels market position is the provision of value added services that customers
increasingly demand.  In March we introduced our enhanced next day delivery service that will
offer advance-notice one-hour delivery and collection windows which can easily be re-
arranged. This includes our new “You’re Next” texting service to inform customers when their
delivery is some ten minutes away; an industry first which will further improve the first time
delivery experience for our customers. This added functionality gives Parcels tremendous
opportunity for customer acquisition and puts us firmly in the top tier of an increasingly
polarised market.
Looking forward, we expect Parcels growth to slow during the 2014/15 financial year as our
capacity is partially constrained ahead of the increases in which we are investing coming on
stream.

Mail
Mail revenues increased by 1.5% to £245.3m (2013: £241.6m).  On an adjusted
basis, taking account of the four extra days compared to last year, they declined
by some 0.4%.  This decline however was largely caused by a mix change towards
Customer Direct Access (CDA) mail, which carries a lower revenue per item.
Our mail volumes increased by some 2.0% compared to the prior year, while the
overall UK mail market has seen a decline in transactional volumes of some 5%
per annum.  This growth in market share has been achieved through generating
additional mail volumes from existing customers, and a number of new customer
wins.
Mail operating profits increased by 18.0% to £12.7m (2013: £10.7m). On an
adjusted basis, taking account of the additional working days, the increase was
some 14.0%. The operating margin increased to 5.2% (2013: 4.4%).  
UK Mail remains a market leader with an operational template that is ideally suited
to adapt to the demands of an evolving mail market, and we have continued to
focus on growing our business by gaining additional volumes from new and
existing customers, and on investing for the future.  To increase the efficiency of
our operations and to provide additional facilities to our customers we have
invested in two new, state-of-the-art, mail sortation machines, at a capital cost of
some £0.9m, which reflects our confidence in the future prospects of our mail
business.
In February 2014 Ofcom announced that it was to investigate a complaint from TNT
concerning certain access prices introduced in April 2014.  In April 2014 Ofcom
confirmed that this would be dealt with under its Compensation Act powers. We
believe this Ofcom investigation has no direct effect on UK Mail.  It does however
create uncertainty in the wider market and we would trust that Ofcom resolves the
matter as swiftly as practical.  In April 2014 Ofcom also announced a review of
access mail arrangements.  We will fully assist with this review but, again, see no
direct implications for our business.
imail, our web-to-print postal service, continues to show healthy growth and
monthly items are now in excess of 2m.  We continue to invest to increase our
capacity and provide additional services, such as high speed insertion, and this
year we launched a brand new website for the service, providing customers with
enhanced personalisation options, innovative data services, and a new suite of
products.  This includes the introduction of advanced software and functionality for
SME clients to promote integrated customer communications strategies.
The success of imail has meant that we have become the fastest growing digital
printer of our type in the UK.   Our area of speciality remains small run printing.
We have now decided to build on this business to create ‘imailprint’.  This will
provide a specialist printing service which, rather than being purely mailed as with
our current service, can produce printed documents for general usage.  We see
this as a natural, low risk, medium-term growth opportunity.
Packets represents an exciting new growth area for the Group.  We have recently
launched a new packets service, based on a new agreement with Royal Mail which
will allow us to offer customers a two/three day, low cost delivery service.  The
new agreement enables us to collect packets, using our nationwide efficient
network, and sort them for final delivery by Royal Mail.  This combination allows 
us to provide a profitable product to customers which can compete with the
‘lifestyle couriers’ who provide a basic service at low cost.  We estimate the
packets market to be worth some £1.2bn, of which we estimate some £200m is
handled by ‘lifestyle couriers’.
We would expect the new packets product to make a positive contribution in the
new financial year with good medium-term growth prospects once it is fully
established in the market.
Courier
Revenues in our Courier business, which provides same-day delivery services,
decreased slightly by 1.9% to £16.2m (2013: £16.5m). We are continuing to
focus on national contracts that can leverage our network and blue chip customer
base.  Operating margins increased to 17.0% (2013: 15.5%) helping to increase
operating profit by 7.2% to £2.7m (2013:  £2.6m).  The increase in operating
margin reflects the actions management have taken to improve operational
effectiveness and reduce overheads in the business.
Our Courier network also provides the ‘istore’ service.  This involves the local
storage of parts and components for which service engineers need easy access to
complete timely service jobs.  We provide the storage facilities, largely in our
parcels depots, and the courier delivery service to the engineers.  This is a growing
market in which we have developed a market leading position.
We have now developed a highly efficient nationwide courier network with a proven
ability to support national contracts, which adds to our ability to offer a fully
integrated proposition and supports product development across the Group. 
Pallets
Revenues in our Pallets business, which provides a nationwide palletised goods
delivery service, decreased by 3.2% to £27.1m (2013: £28.0m).  Operating profit
for the period however increased by 18.8% to £0.9m (2013: £0.8m).  
The Pallets business is based on a national network of members.  In the last
financial year we experienced temporary gaps in the network which reduced input
volumes and gave rise to additional delivery costs.  Those gaps are resolved
although it is taking time for the new members to achieve the sales volumes that
would be expected from established members.  Operating profits have now started
to recover as these plans have taken effect.
Changes we have made to our Pallets business have resulted in a more sustainable
business model for the future and we remain convinced that it can be successful
in a market with good long term growth prospects.
Central Costs
Central costs increased by 26.2% to £16.0m (2013: £12.7m). This increase is largely
due to increase I.T. costs, reflecting our increased investments in this key area.
Guy Buswell, Chief Executive
UK Mail remains a market leader with an operational template
that is ideally suited to adapt to the demands of an evolving mail
market, and we have continued to focus on growing our
business by gaining additional volumes from new and existing
customers, and on investing for the future.

Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements Financial Position
The Group has maintained its financial position during the year.  Despite the initial investment in our new hub and in automation – details of which are set out
below - we had net cash at the end of the period of £27.0m (2013: £27.0m).  
Net cash inflow from operations totalled £33.2m (2013: £31.1m).  Net cash outflow for the period was £0.8m (2013: inflow £6.6m) which included £1.6m of
cash generated from working capital (2013: £5.6m). 
The Group paid £10.7m (2013: £9.9m) of dividends during the period. 
To provide funding for the investment in the new hub and automation the Group put in place a £25m five year revolving credit facility with Lloyds Bank plc on
14 May 2014.  This facility will support the cash requirements of the investment programme.

Reported Group revenues for the year at £508.5m were up 7.0% compared to the previous year. However, the underlying increase was 5.3% after adjusting for the
additional four trading days in the year under review.
The increases in both Mail and Parcels reflected both strong levels of customer retention, together with good volumes resulting from new customer wins.

Reported operating profit increased 28.3%, largely driven by volume increases in both Mail and Parcels. 
Mail operating profits increased by some £2.0m, largely driven by strong customer retention and new business wins. The operating margin within Mail increased to
5.2%. 
Parcels operating profits increased by 37.2%, as we continue to see an increase in home deliveries related to online shopping, with a continuation of the mix towards
B2C that we have seen previously. As a result Parcels reported operating margin of 10.2%, some 1.6 percentage points better than 2013.
As reported last year, actions taken to control the cost base have enabled Courier to report a 1.5 percentage point increase in the operating margin, despite reduced
revenues. 
Operating profits within Pallets increased by 18.8%, as gaps reported in the network last year are now resolved, although it is taking time for members to achieve the
growth expected from established members. 7
HS2
In December 2013 we reached agreement with the Secretary of State for Transport concerning compensation for the relocation of our Birmingham hub as a result of the
proposed High Speed Two (HS2) railway.
This will involve the sale of our Heartlands site to the Department for Transport (DfT) and the relocation of our central hub and Head Office to a newly constructed facility
near Coventry. 
The value we have agreed with the DfT and HS2 Ltd for our Heartlands site is £9.5m.  £8.6m of this value was received in December 2013, with the balance payable
from the DfT when we fully vacate the Heartlands site and complete the deal, expected to be in late 2015.  We have also agreed further specific compensation payments
with the DfT and HS2 Ltd.  Of these amounts, £2.9m was received in the period with the balance to be received over the next two financial years.  
The costs of the move to the new site, including the I.T. data centre move and related staff costs will be incurred over the next two financial years.  We anticipate that
these costs will be compensated by the DfT and HS2 Ltd (subject to the requirements of the Compensation Code).

Capital expenditure for the period included our underlying business capital expenditure combined with the initial investment in our new hub and in automation.
This can be summarised as follows

Underlying capital expenditure 11.3 9.2

Investment in automation 3.3 -
Total capital expenditure 27.9 9.2
The underlying capital expenditure includes £6.6m on I.T. as we continue to develop our system infrastructure, and £3.3m on our network.
The investment in the new hub is the cost of the land together with the initial payments for the construction contract.  The total expected to be spent on the land and
building over the period to March 2015 is some £35m. We expect our contribution to the building of the new hub will be some £15m which covers the enhancement
of the site and building beyond the scale of the current facility. The investment in automation reflects the initial payments for the design and development of the hub
and network automation equipment.  As previously guided, the total expected to be spent on this equipment, over the period to September 2015, is some £20m.

Non-current assets increased by £20.1m, with £16.6m being the initial investment in our new hub and automation.
Increased business activity largely accounts for the increase in current assets, with high cash collections debtor days reduced to 32.2 days (2013: 33.0 days).
This increased activity was also reflected in the £8.7m increase in current liabilities where other creditors which include franchise, AFA and subcontractor creditors,
increased £3.6m, deferred compensation £2.6m and trade creditors increased £2.4m year-on-year.
Non-current liabilities (excluding borrowings) increased by £8.7m, of which £8.9m represents the deferred compensation to be utilised in 2015.
Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements 18
UK Mail Report & Accounts 2014          Strategic Report
The 6.7% increase in cash generated from operations was driven by a £5.0m increase in operating profits, offset by a decrease in cash generated from working capital,
£1.6m this year (2013: £5.6m).
With an increase in the amount expended on capital expenditure, free cash flow decreased 44.8% to £10.6m (2013: £19.2m).
As a result net cash at the year end was £27.0m (2013: £27.0m), comprising of £27.4m (2013: £28.2m) of cash at bank and in hand and £0.4m (2013: £1.2m) total debt.
Further information can be found in note 28.
Net finance income
Continued strong control over working capital enabled the Group to maintain high average cash balances throughout the year, enabling the Group to earn £0.2m (2013:
£0.2m) of bank deposit interest income.  
Once other interest costs of £0.1m (2013: £0.1m) are taken into account, the Group reported net finance income of £0.1m (2013: £0.1m).
Taxation
The Group’s effective tax rate was 23.3% (2013: 24.3%); the reduction largely a direct reflection of the 1% reduction in corporation tax effective from 1 April 2013.
Earnings per share
Basic earnings per share increased 29.6% to 32.0p (2013: 24.7p).  
Dividend
The Board has proposed a 14.5% increase in the Final Dividend to 14.2p (2013: 12.4p), resulting in a total dividend for the year of 21.3p (2013: 18.8p), an increase of
13.3%.  The Final Dividend is payable on 25 July 2014, to shareholders registered on 27 June 2014.
The total dividend is covered 1.50 times by earnings (2013: 1.31 times).  The Board believes this level of Dividend cover is appropriate for the business.
Treasury risk management
The treasury function of the Group operates within policies and procedures approved by the Board.  These procedures cover funding, banking relationships, foreign currency,
interest rate exposures and cash management.
The Group has considered carefully its cash flows and banking covenants for the next three years. These have been appraised in light of the current economic climate and
on a number of forecast scenarios. As such, conservative assumptions on profitability and working capital performance have been used to determine the level of financial
resources required by the Group and to assess liquidity risk.
The Group continually assesses its actual and forecast cash position on a weekly basis.  This ensures that in the short term the Group’s cash is used optimally. Each month
a medium term review of the forecast is undertaken to ensure full compliance with the banking covenants.
Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group will not be able to meet its financial obligations as they fall due. The Group’s strong levels of operating cash flow and low indebtedness
mean that it is not significantly exposed to liquidity risk. 
The Group is not significantly exposed to the effects of fluctuations in exchange rates since all income is in sterling and costs denominated in foreign currency, principally
the euro, represent less than 1% of all expenditure.  
The Group’s exposure to any significant interest risk is minimal due to the relatively low level of debt.

Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements UK Mail Report & Accounts 2014          Strategic Report
A successful risk management process considers the potential risks in the context of their impact and probability. The Board has overall responsibility for ensuring that the
Group has an appropriately balanced approach to risk management and internal control whilst achieving the Group’s overall business plans and strategic objectives.
The Group has an established risk management monitoring and review process as described in the Corporate Governance Report on pages 31 to 41. The process requires
management to identify, evaluate and monitor risks and take steps to reduce, eliminate or manage those risks.  
These risks facing the group are scored as to the likelihood of their occurrence and the scale of their potential impact, with allowance made for the effectiveness of existing or
planned mitigating controls, such that the overall Risk Register can be suitably prioritised. 
This register, together with the identification, implementation and progression of mitigation plans are reviewed on an on-going basis in detail by senior management of the Group.
The Audit Committee, on behalf of the Board who ultimately retain the responsibility for the Company’s risk management framework, review the risk management process and
the highest category risks identified on the Risk Register on a regular basis.
These highest category risks are reported in detail to the Audit Committee on a High Entity Risk register (‘HERR’), of which 28 risks had been identified at the date of this report.
Further detail of the work undertaken by the Audit Committee in this area can be found in the Audit Committee report on page 37.
The table below details the principal risks and uncertainties faced by the Group and the steps taken to mitigate their impact. The Board considers these to be the most significant
risks, and whilst not directly comparable, they have been ranked in terms of relative importance to the Company at this time.  
They do not comprise all of the risks identified by the Company, nor those presently unknown to management, or those currently deemed less material, which may also have
an adverse effect on the business.
Additionally, the Group, in common with others is exposed to a number of financial risks including market risk, credit risk, interest risk, liquidity risk and capital risk, details of
which can be found in note 24.

Policy
The UK Mail People Strategy has been developed to engage our people to deliver
the company vision.  It is a three year rolling plan, reviewed on an annual basis
Recruiting, rewarding and recognising our people, by creating a business that puts
its people and its customers at the centre of all its activities, and recognising that
our people matter and are key to the business achieving its goals, remains key to
the business.
We  review and improve how we engage and communicate as this is key to our
employees understanding the part they play to achieve the Company vision.
Having an open, honest and transparent communications strategy is key to this.
Learning, developing, coaching and mentoring is a key priority, and this is
achievable by continuing to develop both our employee and leadership capability,
through our internal learning and management development programme
demonstrating our commitment to people development.  In addition our Driver
Training programme is taking a further step forward, enhanced by the development
of a specific Driver Training team, whose objective is to provide the best drivers in
the industry.
Working safely continues to be top of the agenda with our processes and
procedures under a programme of continuous review therefore demonstrating that
we value the safety of our employees and customers ensuring that nothing we do
will cause harm.
We continue to work towards our employees describing UK Mail as ‘a great place
to work’ and achieving our aim of being an ‘Employer of Choice’ within the parcel
and mail sector.
Diversity
It is our policy to ensure that no job applicant, employee, customer or contractor
receives less favourable treatment for any reason. We want to make sure no one is
disadvantaged by unjustifiable conditions, criteria or practices because of their
sex, gender, race, colour, ethnic origin, religion, sexual orientation,
disability,marital status, age, or any other grounds of discrimination prohibited by
legislation.
We are an equal opportunities employer, and being this is about good employment
practices and efficient use of our most valuable assets, our employees. Every
manager and employee has personal responsibility for the implementation of our
equal opportunities policies.
Our gender split is as follows:
� 1 (14%) female directors including non executives of the company
� 6 (86%)Male directors including non executives of the company

Communication and Engagement
UK Mail completed its first employee survey in March / April 2013, and were
encouraged with a 50% response rate.  Employees were asked about  their views on
their understanding of business objectives and achievements together with their
thoughts on team work, recognition, and learning and development so that employee
engagement could be assessed. 
The findings of the survey were analysed by department through to an overall group
view, and actions plans were developed and worked through the year 2013/14.
The aim was to ensure a programme of continuous improvement and increased
engagement was developed from a group action plan perspective changes have been
made to policies enhancing the Long Service Policy, to the way we communicate, to
the expansion of our learning and development programme through better promotion
of learning offered and accessibility, and to the enhancement of our Employee
Consultative Group .  Our second Employee Survey is planned for June 2014, and we
are looking forward to receiving and acting on the results.
In February 2014, the Group was reassessed for the ‘Investors in People’ accreditation
and are proud to have been re-accredited for a further 3 years.
The Employee Consultative Group (‘ECG’) is well established, and provides the voice
of the employees to the senior Management team with the aim of influencing
workplace change by giving their views, thoughts and opinions and to ensure that
company feedback is communicated back to employees in a structured and
consistent way.
The ECG Representative numbers continue to increase and in 2013 /14 a new ECG
modular Learning and Development programme was launched in order to ensure that
the training available to all ECG Representatives upskilled their knowledge and
showed progression of the group.  In January 2014, a new ECG Chairperson was
appointed from our Driver population who will serve for a three year term.  We are
looking forward to working with him to development and implement some of his
progressive and forward thinking ideas so that the ECG can move to the next level.
The ECG brand, aims and objectives were reviewed and refreshed in 2013, again to
ensure that the ECG is kept up to date.  In 2014 / 15 the plan is to revisit the ECG
Constitution, which has come about due to the appointment of 6 ECG area
Representatives, who are an area support function for the ECG Chairperson, We
continue to hold the bi annual ECG T eam Conferences in March and September of each
year, and continue to use these for ECG Representatives to get direct access to the
senior management of UK Mail, and  be able to give them direct information, advice
and support which supplements our aim of making UK Mail a great place to work.
22 Recognition and Reward 
During 2013/14 we started a programme of employee benefit reviews and engaged with an external
benefits expert to review the benefits, both contractual and voluntary on offer at UK Mail, ensuring
that what is offered matches employee expectation.
In November 2013, UK Mail staged into the Pension Auto Enrolement arena, and have had a limited
numbers of opt outs of the scheme.  The scheme continues to be run on a salary sacrifice basis
therefore continuing to allow employees to make savings on their National Insurance.
The ‘I Delivered’ Awards is the UK Mail Recognition scheme, and is now in its fourth year.  The
scheme recognises employees for going the extra mile, and above and beyond what is required.  In
the 2013/14 year the scheme had its highest nomination rates with awards being made on a
quarterly basis, which are then carried forward to the National Awards held in May 2014.
Learning and Development
During 2013/14 Learning and Development formally plotted the succession planning process for all
roles within UK Mail via a Learning and Development matrix.  This is  linked to the first Learning and
Development Directory within the business. This tracks what courses and development an employee
should have by role, promoting succession and career planning, and makes it easier for Line
Managers to be able to review development requirements during the performance review process.
Management Development training continues and the objective for 2014/15 is to offer the Institute
of Leadership and Management level 3 and 5 accredited qualification.
The UK Mail employee incumbent Apprenticeship programme continues to run enabling employees
to study whilst working for a recognised accredited qualification.
‘App for that’ – Apprenticeships with UK Mail’ was rolled out to a further 11 pilot sites in 2013/14
in the areas of Warehousing, Mail Sortation and Customer Care, therefore totaling 15 sites
participating in the scheme to date.  All UK Mail apprencticeship positions are permanent
employees filling an established rolled in the business, and have a full training programme available
to them over a 12 month period.
The UK Mail Work Experience programme continues and all operational sites have an objective to
have a least one work experience student in their site over a 12 month period.  Where possible
successful Work Experience candidates are offered a permanent position when one comes available,
and are then also started on the UK Mail apprenticeship programme.
Health, wellbeing, occupational health and support continues to be a top priority and part of the
people strategy, with support being provided, when required, for those employees unfortunate to be
long term sick.  This continues to form part of the Group’s health and well-being strategy.

Corporate responsibility
UK Mail Report & Accounts 2014          Strategic Report
UK Mail continues to be committed to Corporate Responsibility (‘CR’) and regard the integration of sound CR practices (which take into account the
interests of all our stakeholders be they employees, customers, shareholders or the wider community) as a long-term, sustainable approach to business.
We continue to devote significant resources towards improving CR standards and practices within the Group. Our CR programme has four key elements;
environment, health and safety, employment and community.
UK Mail is a signatory to the United Nations Global Compact, confirming our committal to CR.  We have committed to aligning our operations and
strategies with ten universally accepted principles in areas such as labour, business integrity, employment, human rights and the environment.
Steven Glew is the Board member responsible for CR and the strategy is approved at Board level.  He, together with the CR Steering Committee
manages, develops and communicates our CR strategy, to provide direction and guidance on all aspects of business practice and responsibility. The
members of the CR Steering Committee are drawn from a number of disciplines across the company (human resources, health and safety, operations,
transport, procurement, communications and legal.)
The Board takes account of the significance of social, environmental and ethical (‘SEE’) matters to the business of the company. Currently we have
identified no social, environmental or ethical risks that would have a material impact on our business.
The Environment   
The Group recognises that it has a responsibility to reduce its impact on the environment and seeks to increase the environmental sustainability of its
operations and those of its suppliers.  Whilst we recognise that we have an important role to play in delivering goods and mail in the UK, we are acutely
aware of the impact that transport operations have on the environment and the Group is committed to reducing this impact by the introduction of cost
effective solutions and changes which result in real benefits to the environment as a whole. Our environmental policy is regularly reviewed and is
available on our company website, www.ukmail.com 
Our 2013/14 CR Targets and Achievements
We are one year into our three year programme and we have made a good start.  Again the main focus is on CO² emissions, health and safety, utilities,
waste and our people.  We will be using 2012/13 as the key baseline to ensure continuous improvement.  Following the successful implementation of
ISO14001 we are going to work toward certification of OHSAS18001.
Our performance in the year against our targets is as follows:
Actual Target Actual Change Variance 
2013 2014 2014 against 2013 against target
1. CO² emissions (tonnes) 58.4k 55.5k 61.0k 4.5% 9.9%

24 1. UK Mail’s Carbon Emissions
• 2014 Achievement – 9.9% adverse to target
• 10.9% favourable to 2012/13 by consignment volume
• 2014 Target – Reduce by 5%
UK Mail’s total carbon emissions were 61.0k tonnes. This is overwhelmingly made up of emissions
from fuel burn. The calculation of these emissions is based on respected industry measurements
(Carbon Trust and Defra).
UK Mail’s Carbon Emissions
Emission total 
(tonnes)
CO² emitted from transportation activities 1 55,336
CO² equivalent from facilities 2 5,712
Total emissions (CO²) 61,048
1 Emissions from transportation activities are internally verified.  Note that the CO² reported figure for fuel emissions
is actual CO² which is emitted from all fuel dependent assets, including Heavy Good Vehicles, C+D Vans, Company
Cars and Mechanical Handling Machinery.  CO² equivalents from franchise or service partner operations are not
included in the reporting of CO² emissions. Emissions calculated using the Defra GHG Conversion Factors 2008
Guidelines for conversion of fuel.
2 Emissions calculated using the Carbon Trust Energy & Carbon Conversions 2011 Update Guidelines for conversion
of grid electricity and gas.
In addition to total emissions, UK Mail also monitors emissions per item handled. 3
At 0.393kg per item, UK Mail has significantly reduced this figure over the last year. In the 2012/13
financial year, UK Mail’s emissions per item handled was 0.441kg per item, representing a 10.9%
or 48 grams per item improvement.
3 This is a measure of how efficiently a single parcel item or consolidated mail item (tray or bag of envelopes) is
handled from the point of collection through to the point of delivery.  It does not include equivalents from franchise
or service partner operations.
We have again set ourselves challenging emission reduction targets for the next three years which
we aim to meet by a number of initiatives which includes a new consignment volume target.
Fuel
UK Mail’s two key objectives remain:
Objective 1: To reduce the distance travelled by our vehicle fleet through effective route
planning and optimisation of vehicle fill.
We continue to use sophisticated route planning software to optimise the mileage travelled by our
fleet.
Telematics devices are fitted to allow our heavy commercial vehicles to provide information on a
number of key factors such as harsh braking, not driving in the ‘green zone’, idling time and speed,
all of which can have a negative effect on miles per gallon (‘MPG’).
Close management of our telematics devices in all of our heavy commercial vehicles has
significantly improved driving behaviour and fuel consumption per journey. We will continue to
proactively manage our drivers to ensure we optimise the MPG by vehicle and route.  
During the year we implemented new software for our parcel delivery scanners which ensure our
drivers take the most optimum route when collecting and delivering parcels. One of the key benefits
of this software is to significantly reduce the miles driven.
The move to automation in 2015 will mean improved vehicle loading, resulting in fewer vehicles and
less journeys made.
Objective 2: To reduce the fuel consumption of our vehicles through a review of the
vehicle designs used and other effective means..
We have replaced 193 commercial vehicles over the past two years, including 88 the Euro 6 tractor
units which comply with the latest diesel engine emission standards. Over the next 12 months we
will be replacing a number of trailers with improved aerodynamic features. We continue to review
and re-engineer our vehicle and trailer specifications and designs to maximise MPG through the use
of sloping roof trailers and other innovations.

UK Mail Report & Accounts 2014          Strategic Report
We have recently recruited a Driver Trainer and one of his key objectives will
be to ensure maximum MPG from our drivers through changing driver
behaviour.
Improved tyre husbandry ensures our tyres run to maximum performance.
Lower rolling resistance tyres (to aid MPG) are being fitted as standard.
Our CO² emissions across our company cars has reduced to an average of
120g/km.  Drivers are encouraged to make fewer business journeys by
replacing them with conference calls and we now have video conferencing
on all desk and lap-top computers.
Energy
We have reduced our electricity consumption by 5.1% and gas consumption
by 5.3% during the year.
We have installed energy ‘smart’ meters in all of our sites. These meters
provide regular ‘on line’ energy usage readings for both gas and electricity
throughout the day, every day. This information is enabling us to identify and
reduce unusual energy usage, particularly during the periods when we are
not operating.
During the year we replaced the lighting in our Birmingham, Manchester,
Thames Valley, Leicester and Docklands sites to more energy efficient
lighting with movement and light sensors which reduced our lighting energy
consumption by around 14%.
During the coming year, we are looking at extending the replacement lighting
initiative at a number of other sites. We have also installed energy reduction
systems at various sites to reduce electricity consumption of our automation
equipment.
We have launched an environmental challenge with the aim of further
engaging all our employees in energy conservation.
2. Health, Safety and Environment Compliance
• 2014 Achievement – 96.6% 
• 2016 Target 95.0%
The Group fully embraces and endorses the legal and moral obligation to
protect the health, safety and welfare of employees and others who may be
affected by our operations.
Robust policies are deployed to ensure training, risk assessment, safe
systems of work and accident investigations are carried out throughout the
Company. Policies are updated on an on-going basis to ensure they reflect the
changing environment in which we operate. Health and safety is discussed at
Group Board meetings utilising our monthly health and safety report, which
outlines proactive and reactive measures for discussion and debate. 
A full Health, Safety and Environmental (HSE) audit is conducted at each
operating location at least annually, with locations receiving a score and an
improvement plan on completion.  Locations are challenged to achieve a
“Pass Mark” of 95% and those failing to do so undertake a re-audit within six
months to ensure that improvement plan actions have been implemented.
We are pleased to report that the average score achieved in the year has
increased to 96.61% (with all sites achieving the 95% pass mark).  This has
been achieved through improved staff awareness, new working methods and
safety being integrated into the way we work.
Our health and safety intranet site hosts management information which
includes specific procedures and policies such as emergency response, safe
operating methods, risk assessments, accident investigation procedures and
the carriage of dangerous goods, as well as communications to promote
health and safety in the workplace.
3. Workplace Fatalities
• 2014 Achievement – 0
• 2014 Target – 0
There were no fatalities during the year.
4. ISO 14001 Corporate Sites
• 2014 Achievement – Maintained certification at all sites
• 2016 Target – Maintain certification
ISO 14001 is the key certification standard for Environmental Management
Systems.  It sets rigorous demands for the continuous improvement of our
environmental management system provisions and is externally audited and
verified by an UKAS accredited certification body on a regular basis.  We are
pleased to report that we continue to hold ISO14001 certification across all
of our corporate sites.
5. ISO 14001 Franchise Sites
• 2014 Achievement – Work not yet started
• 2016 Target – 100% compliance at franchise sites
We plan to extend our ISO14001 certification to our franchise sites by 2016.
Work on this objective has not yet started.
6. OHSAS18001 at Corporate Sites
• 2014 Achievement – Work not yet started
• 2016 Target – 100% compliance at corporate sites
We have an objective to achieve OHSAS18001 certification across all of our
corporate sites, which is the British Standard for occupational health and
safety management systems.  Work on this objective has not yet started.
Waste Management:
7. Landfill Diversion (Waste which goes to materials or energy
recycling or transfer stations)
• 2014 Achievement – Increased to 96.3%
• 2014 Target – 95.0%
8. Waste To Landfill (Waste which goes directly to landfill only)
• 2014 Achievement – 51.1% favourable to target
• 2014 Target – Reduce by 5.0%
9. Total Waste (the volume of total waste generated)
• 2014 Achievement – 28.6% adverse to target
• 2014 Target – Reduce by 5.0%
We continue to improve the management of our waste. UK Mail now
backhauls all of our cardboard and stretch-wrap waste to a regional site in
order to make recycling more efficient. We now only have two waste streams;
landfill and mixed recyclables.  Our landfill diversion rates are over 96%,
compared with just 5% in 2008. 
Although we are sending significantly less waste to landfill, our volume of
waste generated has increased due to the growth in our business volumes.
Our key focus over the next 12 months is to reduce this. 
10. Water Consumption
• 2014 Achievement – 6.2% favourable to target
• 2014 Target – Reduce by 5.0%
28 26 Good progress has been made in reducing our water consumption by 6.2% against our target of a 5% reduction.
The average number of employees has increased since the 2012/13 base year which means that the comparison
of usage per employee has reduced by 14%.
• 2013 – 2,649 employees – 13.94M³
• 2014 – 2,756 employees – 11.93M³
We have installed water saving devices at all sites to reduce consumption and waste. We have also removed
vehicle wash facilities at a number of sites to further reduce our water usage and have installed smart metres at
our high consumption sites.
Employee involvement
We continue to raise awareness amongst our employees by ensuring they understand how their actions impact
the environment. We encourage switching off lights, powering off desktop computers, laptops, photocopiers and
ensuring that office materials, and ensuring that work practices increase recycling.
Working with our suppliers
We work closely with our suppliers to improve their environmental standards and we request details about their
environmental practices and accreditation as part of the supplier selection process.  Our Supplier Code of
Conduct defines our minimum standards of business activity and shapes the way we work with our suppliers for
mutual gain.  We continually work with suppliers to develop new products and in the re-engineering of existing
products to use more environmentally friendly materials and less finite materials such as paper and polymer.  We
are introducing degradable plastic to our Bagits at a lower micron thickness which will use about 10% less
polymer. We are in the process of rolling out a new fleet of photocopiers which will be set to print double-sided,
this along with the introduction of the driver scanning system which will mitigate the need for driver run sheets
will see the amount of copier paper reduce by some 10%.  We also work with more UK based suppliers who
produce our high volume products in the UK instead of other parts of the world, and this significantly reduces the
transportation involved.
Community
We believe in community investment and that UK Mail should play our part as a good corporate citizen,
supporting charities and community activities that affect our staff and customers.
We financially support employees who are involved in personal fundraising initiatives for causes close to their
hearts.  During the year we donated £28,200 to a diverse range of charities through our Staff Sponsorship
Scheme, helping fund cancer charities, children’s charities, local hospices, The British Heart Foundation and Air
Ambulance, amongst others.  
Our commitment to working with Job Centre Plus and employment partners that support the long term
unemployed continues, so that wherever possible, we support recruitment from welfare to sustained employment.
This is achieved through our Work Experience Programme and our Apprenticeship programme ‘Appforthat’. The
Company has been successful in converting a number of work experience candidates into either Apprenticeships
or employed status and continues to actively support this government initiative.
The ‘Appforthat’   Apprenticeship programme was launched in April 2013.  After being piloted in four operational
sites, it has now been rolled out to a further 11 sites across the UK.  The programme works in partnership with
an external training partner.
Charity Giving
Throughout the year, UK Mail chose to support the NSPCC, one of the UK’s largest children’s charities. We
raised just under £34,000 for the cause, and the money has been donated to the NSPCC’s, ChildLine Schools
Service. This service trains volunteers to visit primary schools around the UK, educating children about when
they should contact ChildLine about issues such as abuse or bullying.  
This includes a donation made by UK Mail. Our employees organised local fundraising activities for the
NSPCC, such as sky dives, bike rides and half marathons, or smaller fundraisers such as dress down days
and cake sales, which took place during working hours.  We also ran an employee payroll lottery scheme;
generating £1,800 for the charity.  
Throughout 2015, UK Mail will be working in partnership and raising money for both the NSPCC and The
Royal British Legion.  The Legion has been raising funds and providing care and support to serving members
of the Armed Forces, veterans and their families since 1921. We are proud to be supporting them for the year
in which they commemorate 100 years since World War 1 began. 
UK Mail operates a ‘Payroll Giving Scheme,’ allowing all our employees the opportunity to contribute to their
preferred charity through tax efficient salary deductions.  
Finally, we have a policy of supporting supplier and client charitable fundraising initiatives through donations
of monies or gifts.

Dear Shareholder,
In my letter to you last year, I confirmed my long held belief that good corporate governance is the foundation on which strong corporate performance can be built.
I am fortunate to chair a Board who share this view; one which remains not only fully committed to the high standards of corporate governance as laid down in the Financial
Reporting Council’s (‘FRC’) UK Corporate Governance Code 2012 (the ‘Code’), but one which supports the very principles on which that was written.
I believe that these principles have been important to our success.
As is often said, “tone comes from the top” and I see the Board’s role is to create the right culture that will enable our colleagues to perform their duties to the best of their
abilities, whilst at the same time enabling them to develop and maximise their own skill sets and experience.
This drives career advancement, which the Board is highly supportive of, regardless of age, gender, educational achievement, or background.
This equally applies to members of the Board, who also strive to improve their own performance year-on-year. Central to this, is the Board evaluation exercise undertaken
annually, from which objectives and targets are derived for the coming year.
In the report that follows we provide an overview of our corporate governance practices, describing how the main principles of the Code have been applied throughout the
year.
The report includes individual reports from the Chairmen of the Audit Committee, the Nomination Committee and the Remuneration Committee which together describe
how we conduct our business in line with the Code’s provisions and other accepted principles of good corporate governance.
Finally, I would again welcome the opportunity to see you at this year’s AGM.
Peter Kane
Chairman of the Board
Chairman’s letter 30 The Listing Rules of the UK Listing Authority require listed companies to disclose how they comply with the principles of good governance and code of best practice known
as the UK Corporate Governance Code 2012 (the ‘Code’), and whether there has been compliance with its provisions throughout the financial year. A copy of the Code may
be found on the Financial Reporting Council’s website (www.frc.org.uk). 
The Company is a smaller company for the purposes of the Code and in consequence certain provisions of the Code either do not apply to the Company or may be judged
to be less relevant to the Company.
The directors consider that the Company has complied fully with the provisions of the Code applicable to it throughout the financial year ended 31 March 2014.
This statement explains how the Company has applied the principles of good governance set out in the Code.
The governance structure

Risk Management Committee
The Risk Management Committee’s primary responsibility is to identify, monitor and review the Group’s non-financial risks, reporting at least bi-annually to the Audit
Committee.
Internal audit
The internal audit function, (including externally sourced advisors), provides an independent in-house assurance and consulting activity designed to add value and improve
the Company’s operations. It helps the business accomplish its objectives by bringing a systematic, disciplined approach to evaluate and improve the effectiveness of risk
management, control, and governance processes.
External audit 
The external audit function provides independent audit and review.
Operating Board
The Operating Board has day-to-day responsibility to execute the strategy approved by the board and comprises of the most senior executive management within the Group
including the functional heads of Network and Operations, Mail, IT, as well as the Chief Executive, and Group Finance Director.
Administrative Committee
The Administrative Committee, which comprises a quorum of at least two main Board directors, has a delegated responsibility from the Board to enter into the legal
agreements or contracts approved by the Board, on its behalf. All actions undertaken are reported at the next Board meeting.
The Board
The Board is collectively responsible for the long-term success of the Company and is ultimately accountable to shareholders and other stakeholders for the Group’s strategy,
risk management and performance.
The Board has the powers and duties as set out in all relevant laws and the Company’s Articles of Association. Amendments to the Company’s Articles of Association may
be made in accordance with the provisions of the Companies Act 2006. 
The Board has also reserved a number of matters for its sole consideration. These include;
� the approval of major items of expenditure or commitment, including acquisitions;
� major operational projects, including new contract wins;
� financing, including lease/buy decisions and the use of derivatives and insurance; and
� policy changes relating to the franchise network. 
The Board routinely monitors the various financial, operational and commercial risks facing the Company through reports from management, and takes full consideration of
legislative, health and safety, environmental, employment and governance issues. In forming decisions the Board considers the impact on wider stakeholders including
employees, suppliers and the environment.
Internal control
The Board of directors has overall responsibility for ensuring that the Group maintains a system of internal control to provide it with reasonable assurance regarding effective
and efficient operations, internal financial control and compliance with laws and regulations, whilst the role of management is to implement the Board’s policies on risk and
control and provide assurance on compliance with those policies.
In discharging these responsibilities, the Board confirms that it has established the procedures necessary to comply with the Code, including clear operating procedures,
lines of responsibility and delegated authority.
The key elements of the review processes and control framework across the Group are as follows:
� The Board agrees the corporate strategy and business objectives to be followed over both the medium term (a three year plan), and in the short-term (annual
budgets/forecasts), which divisional management incorporate into their own financial and operational plans;
� Periodic reporting, and subsequent review and discussions with relevant management of business development, KPI achievement, health and safety, operational and
financial performance; 
� Centralisation of certain key functions such as HR, Legal and Treasury enabling the Group to benefit from centres of expertise in the most efficient and cost 
effective manner;
� Proposed capital investment and I.T. project implementations require detailed justification, review and appraisal, prior to any approvals being granted, and post-
implementation reviews are undertaken;
32 Corporate governance report
� Clearly defined hierarchy of responsibilities, including authorisation levels, and documentation of operational and administrative procedures; 
� A Group-wide risk management framework, which accords with the Turnbull guidance, and is supported by reports by the Head of Internal Audit and Group Risk that
the significant risks faced by the Group are being identified, evaluated and appropriately managed having due regard to the balance of risk, cost and opportunity; and
� A whistle-blowing policy which sets out a framework for dealing with any allegations of fraud, financial misreporting and any whistle-blowing notification.
The system of Internal Control is designed to manage and mitigate, rather than eliminate risks completely, and it should be recognised that it can only provide
reasonable not absolute assurance against material misstatement or loss.
Within that context, the Audit Committee, on behalf of the Board, has conducted reviews of the effectiveness of the system of internal controls and processes described
above, as recommended by the UK Corporate Governance Code 2012, and is satisfied that it accords both with the Code and Turnbull guidance.
Financial Reporting
In addition to the general risk management and internal control processes described above, the Group has also implemented internal controls specific to the financial
reporting process and the preparation of the annual and interim consolidated financial statements.
The main control aspects are as follows:
� formal written financial policies and procedures applicable to, and consistent for, all business units;
� a detailed reporting calendar including the submission of detailed monthly accounts for each business unit in addition to the year-end and interim reporting 
process;
� detailed management review at Operating Board and Main Board level of the monthly management accounts, with additionally an Audit Committee review in 
respect of the interim and year-end accounts; and
� monthly reconciliation and review of all balance sheet accounts.
All financial information published by the Group is subject to the approval of the Board, on the recommendation of the Audit Committee.
Board meetings 
The Chairman, in conjunction with the Chief Executive and Company Secretary, plans the agenda for each Board Meeting. That agenda is issued to all Board members
(whether attending the meeting or not), together with all supporting papers before the meeting is held. 
The Company Secretary ensures that the supporting papers provide the Board with the appropriate and necessary information such that the Board as a whole may
discharge their duties. However, where a director feels that more information may be required he/she may either access the services of the Company Secretary or
alternatively may take independent professional advice at the Company’s expense.
Board meetings are normally held at the head office of the Group, albeit at least one meeting per annum is held at the National Hub in Birmingham. Operational
management are invited to attend board meetings on a regular basis. This, together with visits to the sites, helps to provide the individual directors of the Board with
an opportunity to broaden their knowledge of the business, and to meet employees and management of the Group.
The Board meets formally not less than ten times a year, with other meetings held as necessary.  Reports are also supplied to directors in months when a Board
meeting does not take place. 
Formal minutes recording the activities and decisions of the Board and Committee meetings are prepared and circulated to each director. If a Director objects to a
particular decision this is recorded in the minutes of the relevant meeting.
Board composition
The Board currently comprises the Chairman, the Chief Executive, the Group Finance Director (who is also the Company Secretary), the Group Operations Director
(appointed 8 April 2014), and three independent non-executive directors. There is a clear division of responsibilities between the Chairman and the Chief Executive,
set out in writing and agreed by the Board. 
The Chairman is primarily responsible for the effective working of the Board, ensuring that the board as a whole plays a full and constructive part in the development
and determination of the Company’s strategy and its overall commercial objectives. He ensures that the board determines the nature and extent of the significant risks
the Company is willing to accept in the implementation of its agreed strategy. He is also responsible for promoting the highest standards of integrity, and also manages
the relationship and communication with shareholders in relation to any governance matters.
The Chief Executive is responsible for all executive management matters affecting the Company. His principal responsibility is the day-to-day running of the business
and implementation of Board strategy and policy.
Report & Accounts 33
Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements Corporate governance report
The Senior Independent Non-executive Director provides a sounding board for the Chairman and serves as an intermediary for the other directors as necessary. He also
acts as a line of contact for shareholders if they have concerns which are not appropriate for discussion with the Chairman, the Chief Executive or the other executive
directors.
The non-executive directors challenge and agree the Company’s strategy with the Chief Executive and executive management and assess their performance against it. 
Non-executive directors are initially appointed for a three year term with an expectation that they will continue for at least a second term.
As can be seen from the director’s profiles on page 28, the directors have a wide range of skills, knowledge and experience and can bring independent judgement to bear
on matters of strategy, performance, and governance.
Board induction and development
On appointment, the Chairman agrees a personalised induction plan for all new directors, tailored to their experience, background and particular area of focus, which is
designed to develop their understanding of the Group’s culture and operations. The programme has evolved over time having been modified following feedback, but will
usually involve meetings with senior management and site visits.
On an annual basis, the Chairman reviews and approves individual development plans. Directors are encouraged to attend seminars and/or other forums relevant to their
role.
Time commitment
Service agreements and letters of appointment, for both the executive and non-executive Directors, are available for inspection at the Company’s registered office and at
the AGM. 
The letters of appointment for each of the non-executive directors state that in accepting the appointment, the Director confirms that he/she is able to allocate sufficient
time to meet the expectations of the role, with an anticipated time commitment of approximately 20 days per year.
Executive directors are permitted to take a maximum of one non-executive directorship position with another company, but any such involvement must be subject to the
Board’s prior approval.

Board changes during the year
There were no new appointments to the Board during the year.  
Since the year end, Carl Moore was appointed to the Board as Group Operations Director on 8 April 2014, having served on the Operations Board as Network Director
since his appointment in 2007. In accordance with the Company’s Articles of Association Carl will be standing for election at the 2014 AGM.
As a result the Board, excluding the Chairman, now comprises of an equal number of executive and independent non-executive directors. 
Details of the current Board members’ experience and the composition of its committees can be found on pages 34 to 41.

Board evaluation
An evaluation of the Board, its committees, the individual directors and the Chairman was conducted internally. This was led by the Chairman, who invited each director
to complete a survey, the results of which were discussed both collectively as a Board, and with each individual director.  
In addition, the Chairman regularly convenes meetings of the non-executive directors to assess the performance of the Board in the absence of the executive directors.
Furthermore, both the independence and the performance of the Chairman were discussed separately by the non-executives without the Chairman present.
Overall, the Board and its committees remain satisfied that they continue to operate effectively, that the information directors receive is both of the required quality and
provides sufficient time for adequate review, and that there are consequently no material changes required to existing practices.
Board independence
The Code states that the Board should determine whether a director is independent in character and judgement and whether there are relationships or circumstances,
which are likely to affect or could appear to affect, the director’s judgement, for example serving on a board for more than nine years, or where he/she has had a material
business relationship with the Company within the last three years.
The Board considers all the Company’s non-executive directors to be independent in character and judgement and free from any relationships or circumstances which are
likely to affect, or could appear to affect, their judgement.
The Chairman of the company, Peter Kane is not judged to be independent due to his significant shareholding. Peter Kane was appointed as a director in April 2001, and
having now served on the Board for more than nine years, is required under the provisions of the Code to submit himself for re-election each year.
The Board have evaluated Peter’s performance and the operation of the Board as a whole, and are satisfied that no one individual dominates proceedings.
Directors’ conflicts of interests
Under the Companies Act 2006, the Directors have a statutory duty to avoid a situation where they have, or could have, a direct or indirect interest that conflicts, or possibly
may conflict, with the interests of the Company. Directors of public companies may authorise conflicts and potential conflicts where appropriate, if the articles of
association contain a provision to this effect.
The Board is aware of the other commitments of its Directors and is satisfied that these do not conflict with their duties as Directors of the Company. The process for
monitoring conflicts is as follows:
� changes to the commitments of all Directors are reported to the Board;
� the Directors are required to complete a conflicts questionnaire on appointment and annually thereafter;
� any conflicts identified are presented to the Board for consideration and, as appropriate, authorised in accordance with the Companies Act 2006 and the articles of
association; and
� Directors are responsible for immediately notifying the Company Secretary if they become aware of any actual or potential conflict situation or a change in
circumstances relating to an existing authorisation.
The Board has not identified any conflict of interests during the year, and believes that the procedures established to deal with conflicts of interest are operating effectively.
Relations with shareholders
Whilst there is a substantial shareholding represented on the Board, the Company values its dialogue with both institutional and private investors. Two-way communication
with institutional investors, analysts and private investors is actively pursued, and a series of presentations and meetings are held throughout the year, carefully recognising
statutory constraints concerning the disclosure of information. Feedback from these meetings is collated by the Company’s advisers and circulated to members of the
Board to ensure that they are kept informed of the views of shareholders.  In addition, the Chairman periodically attends meetings with shareholders, and non-executive
directors are invited to attend results presentations.
The Group’s annual and half-yearly results, interim management statements, trading updates, presentations given to analysts and all announcements made through the
RNS are published on the Company’s website at www.ukmail.com. A full Annual Report is sent to all shareholders who wish to receive one.
All shareholders are given at least 20 working days’ notice of the AGM. It is standard practice for all directors to attend the AGM to which all shareholders are invited and
at which they may put questions to the chairmen of the various committees or the Board generally. The proxy votes for and against each resolution, as well as votes withheld
(which may be recorded on the proxy form accompanying the notice of AGM) are counted before the AGM commences and are made available to shareholders at the close
of the formal business of the meeting. The proxy votes are also announced through the RNS and posted on the Company’s website shortly after the close of the meeting.

Director, Group Financial Controller, Head of Internal Audit and Group Risk, externally sourced advisors, and senior representatives of the external auditors, although it
reserves the right to request any of these individuals to withdraw.  At least once a year the Committee meets separately with the external auditors and with the Head of
Internal Audit and Group Risk without executive management present.
ACTIVITIES
The committee met four times during the year, and reports of these meetings were provided to the subsequent Board meetings. 
The main areas of focus considered by the Committee during the year were as follows:
Financial reporting
During the year the Committee reviewed the Group’s draft interim and annual financial reports prior to board approval. As part of these reviews the Committee received a
number of reports from both management and the external auditors setting out the accounting issues and significant judgments made by management which required its
attention. 
Report & Accounts 37
Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements The significant issues considered by the Committee were:
Areas of management judgement: On an on-going basis management exercise judgement over the level of provisioning required in a number of areas including sales
ledger credits, claims and bad debts, bonus accruals, insurance reserves, dilapidations, the outcome of share-based payment plans, and purchase order accruals. The
Committee challenged both the underlying assumptions made by management, and the work undertaken by the external auditors, and after discussion and debate agreed
with the accounting treatment adopted in the preparation of the financial statements.
Going concern: The Committee received going concern papers prepared by management, and additional papers prepared by the internal auditor. The papers included the
forecast spending requirements resulting from the planned relocation of the National Hub, financed by the new banking facility agreed with Lloyds Bank plc on 14 May
2014. The Committee paid particular focus to the sensitivities to any potential deterioration in trading, and the options available to management in this event, and agreed
with management’s recommendation that preparation of the accounts on a going concern basis was appropriate.
Goodwill impairment: The Committee received the annual ‘Goodwill impairment review’ papers prepared by management, used to support the carrying value of goodwill
in the Balance Sheet. The Committee, having reviewed the underlying assumptions used in the model against the agreed plans for the relevant business units, and the
sensitivities to any deterioration in future cash flow projections, agreed with managements conclusion that goodwill remained unimpaired.
Accounting for HS2: The Committee considered papers on the accounting treatment of the sale of the National Hub to HS2 Ltd and other compensation payments. The
key issues that the Committee considered included the timing and required financial reporting disclosures.
Fair, balanced and understandable: The Committee is satisfied with the overall picture presented by the Annual Report, having questioned whether the Company had truly
conveyed a ‘fair, balanced and understandable’ message, and whether the report taken as a whole, provided the information necessary for shareholders to assess the
company’s performance, business model and strategy.
Risk management and internal control
The Committee, on behalf of the Board, is responsible for reviewing the effectiveness of the risk management framework within the Group, in relation to the key operational,
compliance and financial risks the Company faces. The Committee therefore reviewed the following;
Risk Register: The Committee twice reviewed the prime financial and non-financial risks, as identified on the Risk Register during the year, together with the effectiveness
of the Group’s controls to manage and mitigate the impact of those risks. 
As part of this work, the Committee approved an enhanced ‘risk impact’ scoring mechanism with those risks and uncertainties which are currently judged by the Board to
have the largest potential impact on the Group set out on pages 20 to 21.
Internal Control Procedures: The Committee considered reports from both the Head of Internal Audit and Group Risk and the Group Finance director on the operation of,
and issues arising from, the Group’s internal control procedures, together with observations from the external auditors and discussions with senior management.
Whistleblowing and fraud incidents: The Committee received whistleblowing and fraud incident reports, and in reviewing those not only assessed the cause of those
incidents, but the subsequent actions taken by management to both resolve and prevent recurrence.
Revenue assurance and IT systems: The Committee received a number of reports on revenue assurance from both management and the internal auditors, which were
discussed in detail, with subsequent actions set for management. This highlighted an opportunity to improve the Group’s IT infrastructure and control processes to provide
additional assurance as to the completeness of income. The Committee supported management’s recommendation to appoint Deloitte LLP , as our ‘internal IT audit’
resource, to provide specialist expertise in this area and to support Internal Audit more generally in IT audit activity, and in developing an IT audit and risk assessment
plan.
Business Continuity tests: The Committee was briefed on the key issues identified from the Business Continuity tests undertaken at four sites during the year, ensuring
relevant points were carried into the Business Continuity Plan.
In conclusion, whilist no significant failings or weaknesses had been identified from the above reviews, the Committee had noted a number of areas where recommeded
improvements were required.
Internal audit
The Committee monitored and reviewed the work of the internal audit function during the year as follows:
Internal Audit Plan: The Internal Audit Plan, which is initially determined by the Head of Internal Audit and Group Risk through a structured process of risk assessment,
was reviewed by the Committee twice during the year, with a number of priorities changed as a result. As discussed above, the Committee, in recognition of the specialist
knowledge required to audit IT systems, and the benefits to be gained from independent review, approved the appointment of Deloitte LLP as internal IT auditors to the
Company.
38   UK Mail Group plc
Audit Committee report Internal audit reports: Members of the Audit Committee received Internal Audit Reports on a regular basis throughout the year, as and when they were concluded. Twice
during the course of the year, the Head of Internal Audit and Group Risk presented updates to the Committee as to the most significant findings resulting from this work,
together with a status and progress report of the agreed management action implementation plans.
The Committee also met with the Head of Internal Audit and Group Risk in private during the year.
External audit
The Committee monitored and reviewed the work of the external audit function during the year as follows:
Audit scope: The scope, fee, and performance of the external auditors were considered by the Audit Committee. The Committee considered the external auditors
assessment in relation to the Group’s financial statements, which for this year were ‘risk of fraud in revenue recognition’, ‘management override of controls’, ‘the relocation
of the national hub’ and ‘Goodwill impairment’. Throughout the year, the Committee tracked these risks and the associated work undertaken by the external auditors.
Audit effectiveness: The Committee monitored the effectiveness and coverage of external audit, through consideration of the content of their report, the degree to which
the agreed audit plan had been delivered, the significant control weaknesses identified, (together with their recommended solutions to these), the experience and expertise
of the auditors and their overall audit judgments and findings.
Significant accounting and control issues: The external auditors reported twice to the Committee (once after the interim review and one after the year-end audit), on the
significant accounting and control issues identified during the course of their work, the key accounting and audit judgements made by management, the level of errors
noted during the audits and made a number of internal control recommendations in their management letter.
Accounting and reporting changes: The Committee received a number of reports from the external auditors during the year regarding developments in accounting and
reporting, regulatory and corporate governance matters.
Auditor independence: The external audit was last put out to tender in 2011, after PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP had been in tenure since the year ended 31 March 2003,
following which the Audit Committee recommended the reappointment of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP to the Board, which was subsequently ratified by shareholders at
the 2012 Annual General Meeting. A new lead audit partner was appointed at this time. The external auditors are required to rotate the audit partners responsible for the
Group and subsidiary audits at least every five years, and employees of the external auditor who have worked on the audit in the past two years are not appointed to senior
financial positions within the Group.
There are no contractual obligations restricting the Company’s choice of external auditor.
The Committee believes it can receive particular benefit from certain non-audit services provided by the external auditors due to their wide and intricate knowledge of the
Group. However, the Committee is also mindful of the potential conflict that can result, whether real or perceived, and therefore has an approved policy for the provision
of non-audit services which can be viewed on the Company’s website www.ukmail.com. 
The policy specifically details a number of services which are not permitted to be provided by the external auditor, including those activities normally undertaken by
management, where the auditor would be rewarded through a success fee, or where the auditor could be required to audit their own work.
The policy permits the external auditors to provide a number of specified non-audit services to the Company without reference to the Committee where the work is closely
related to the performance of the audit, or is a logical extension of the audit, or is of an assurance or compliance nature where the auditors are in the best place to undertake,
and where the fee is both less than £50,000 and cumulatively less than 50% of that financial year’s audit fee.    
The Committee reviewed the non-audit fees paid to the Group’s auditors which was noted as compliant with this policy. Further details of the amounts paid to the
Company’s auditors can be found in Note 4 to the financial statements.
The Committee remains confident that the objectivity and independence of the auditors is not impaired in any way by reason of their non-audit work or other factors and
has adopted controls to ensure that this independence is not compromised. The auditors further confirmed their independence to the Committee in a formal statement.
The Committee also met with the external auditors in private during the year.

Nomination Committee
Role and responsibilities
The main roles and responsibilities of the Nomination Committee are set out in written terms of reference, available on the company’s website www.ukmail.com. These
terms are considered annually by the Nomination Committee and referred to the Board for approval. 
The Committee is responsible for making recommendations to the Board, within these agreed terms of reference.
The main responsibilities of the Nomination Committee are summarised below:
Composition of the Board and its committees
The Nomination Committee is responsible for a number of matters relating to the composition of the Board and its Committees. The Committee meets as necessary to
consider the size, composition and structure of the Board, and succession planning. The Nomination Committee plays a key role for appointments to the Board in agreeing
the principle job description, appointing independent recruitment consultants and interviewing the preferred candidates. 
The Committee keeps itself updated on key developments relevant to the Company, including most recently, on the subject of diversity in the boardroom.  Whilst no specific
targets have been set, the Nominations Committee confirms that the benefits of diversity, including gender diversity, will continue to be a consideration when changes to
the Board are contemplated, whilst ensuring that the primary objective remains ensuring that the Board has the appropriate balance of skills, experience and independence.
The Committee also makes recommendations to the Board on the membership of its committees.
Performance evaluation
The Committee is responsible for reviewing the effectiveness of the Board as a whole and its committees, including its own. As part of this responsibility the Committee
is required to review the time commitments required from non-executives on an annual basis, through use of a performance evaluation process.
Re-election of directors
The Committee makes recommendations to the Board under both the annual re-election and retirement rotation provisions in the Company’s Articles of Association, having
regard to both the overall balance of knowledge, skills and experience on the Board and the need for the Board to be progressively refreshed, particularly in relation to
directors being re-elected for a term beyond nine years.

Bill Spencer 31 May 2012 Independent non-executive director 2 2
Nomination Committee Activity during the year
The Nomination Committee met twice during the year. The Committee discharged its obligations in respect of the financial year in the following ways:
� An initial review of the results of the annual Board evaluation exercise, prior to a subsequent full Board discussion (see page 35);
� A review of the size, structure and composition of the Board;
� A review of the time commitments required of the non-executives; and
� The re-appointment of those directors standing for re-election at the AGM.
Diversity
The Committee recognises the importance of ensuring there is a diversity of background, experience and perspective in its Board and within the wider workforce. Since
the business was first established in 1971 it has supported the progression of individuals through the organisation regardless of gender, age, background or formal
qualifications.
Following the appointment of one female director in 2012, and one male director in April 2014, the Board now has 14% female representation. Whilst the Board remains
supportive of the aims of the Davies Report on Women on Boards, it does not believe that the setting of a specific target for a small Board is necessarily appropriate, as
there is a real risk of overlooking other well-qualified candidates. 
Therefore, in evaluating potential Board appointments, the prime objective of the Nomination Committee will continue to focus on finding the candidate that can bring the
most appropriate skillsets and experience to the Board, whilst mindful of the Davies Reports’ aims.
AGM election and re-election of directors
The Nomination Committee is aware of the FRC’s suggestion that companies outside the FTSE 350 should consider the annual re-election of all directors. On the basis
that this is neither a requirement of the Code, nor has it been raised as an issue by any shareholder the Nomination Committee has chosen not to change its existing
practice. 
The Nomination Committee strongly supports both the re-election of the three directors standing for re-election, and the election of the one director standing for election
at the Company’s forthcoming Annual General Meeting, details of which can be found in the Notice of Meeting accompanying this Annual Report.

Directors’ indemnities
As at the date of this report, indemnities (which are qualifying third-party indemnity
provisions as defined in section 234 of the Companies Act 2006) are in place under
which the Company has agreed to indemnify the directors of the Company and the
former directors of the Company who held office during the year ended 31 March
2014, to the extent permitted by law in and by the Company’s Articles of

maintains insurance against certain liabilities which could arise from a negligent
act or a breach of duty by its directors and officers in the discharge of their duties.
Employment policy 
The Group’s policy is to maintain, as far as practicable, close consultations with
employees on matters likely to affect their interests and, to this end, has an
established Employee Consultative Group. The Group is an equal opportunities
employer and holds an ‘Investors in People’ certificate.
The Group’s policy and practice is to encourage the recruitment and subsequent
training, career development and promotion of disabled persons according to their
aptitudes and abilities and the retention and retraining of employees who may
become disabled during their employment. 
Many employees are stakeholders in the business through participation in share
option and long term incentive plan schemes.
Further information concerning the Group’s human resource management activities
is set out in the ‘Our people’ report on page 22. 
Environmental responsibility and health and safety

Financial instruments
The Group’s accounting policies in respect of financial instruments are set out in
note 24 to the financial statements. The Group’s financial risk management
objectives and policies and its exposure to the following risks – credit, market,
price, interest rate, liquidity, and capital - are included in note 24 to the financial
statements.
Going concern
The Group’s business activities, together with the factors likely to affect its future
development, performance and position are set out in the Strategic Report on page
7. The financial position of the Group, its cash flows, liquidity position and
borrowing facilities are also described in the Strategic Report. The Strategic Report
and note 24 to the financial statements include a description of the Group’s
objectives, policies and processes for managing its capital, its financial risk
management objectives and its exposures to credit risk and liquidity risk.
The Group has considerable financial resources available and a strong balance
sheet, together with long term contracts with a wide range of public and private
sector customers and suppliers as explained in the Strategic Report.  Cash flow
plans are prepared as part of the Group’s annual budget and three year plan.  These
plans are sensitised to provide an understanding of the impact of risks.  The plans
are subject to review by Internal Audit who provide a report to the Board. The Board
has reviewed and approved these plans. As a result, the directors believe that the
Group is well placed to manage its business risks successfully despite the
challenging market conditions.
The directors are satisfied that the Group has adequate financial resources to
continue in business for the foreseeable future and consequently a going concern
basis continues to be appropriate in preparing the accounts.
Share capital
The Company has a single class of share capital which is divided into ordinary
shares of 10p each. All shares rank equally and are fully paid. No person holds
shares carrying special rights with regard to the control of the Company.
Each share carries the right to one vote at general meetings of the Company and no
right to fixed income.

Computershare Trustees (Jersey) Limited is the current trustee of the trust. The
trustees may vote in respect of any shares held in the trust but has waived this right.
Details of the movement in the authorised and issued share capital of the Company
during the financial year to 31 March 2014 and of the outstanding options over
shares in the Company at 31 March 2014 can be found in note 22 to the financial
statements on page 92.
General rights attaching to shares
The rights attaching to the ordinary shares are set out in the Companies Act
2006 and the Company’s Articles of Association. A copy of the Articles can be
obtained on request from the Company Secretary. The Articles may only be
changed by special resolution of shareholders which requires, on a vote on a
show of hands, at least three-quarters of the shareholders or proxies present at
the meeting to be in favour of the resolution or, on a poll, at least three-quarters
in nominal value of the votes cast by shareholders or their proxies to be in favour
of the resolution.
A shareholder whose name appears on the register of members may choose
whether those shares are evidenced by share certificates (certificated form) or
held in electronic form (uncertificated) in CREST.
Dividend rights
Subject to the provisions of the Companies Act 2006, the Company may, by
ordinary resolution, declare a dividend to be paid to shareholders but the
amount of the dividend may not exceed the amount recommended by the Board.
The Board may also pay interim dividends at any time and of any amount
whenever in the opinion of the Board there are sufficient distributable profits of
the Company to merit payment.
Voting rights
Subject to the restrictions set out below, a shareholder is entitled to attend (or
appoint another person as his/her representative (a ‘proxy’) to attend) and to
exercise all or any of his/her rights to speak, ask questions and vote at any
general meeting of the Company. A shareholder may also appoint more than one
proxy, provided that each proxy is appointed to exercise the rights attached to a
different share or shares held by that shareholder. A proxy need not be a
shareholder of the Company.
The right to appoint a proxy does not apply to a person who has been nominated
under section 146 of the 2006 Act to enjoy information rights (a ‘Nominated
Person’). He/she may, however, have a right under an agreement with the
registered shareholder holding the shares on his/her behalf to be appointed (or
to have someone else appointed) as a proxy. Alternatively, if a Nominated
Person does not have such a right, or does not wish to exercise it, he/she may
have a right under such an agreement to give instructions to the person holding
the shares as to the exercise of voting rights.
In accordance with section 327 of the 2006 Act, in order to be valid, any form
of proxy sent by the Company to shareholders or any proxy registered
electronically in relation to any general meeting must be delivered to the
Company’s registrars not later than 48 hours before the time fixed for holding
the meeting (or any adjourned meeting). In calculating the 48 hour period no
account shall be taken of any part of a day that is not a working day. Full details
of the deadlines for exercising voting rights in respect of the 2014 AGM are set
out in the Notice of AGM.
Subject to any rights or restrictions for the time being attached to any class or
classes of shares and to any other provisions of the Articles of Association or
statutes, on a vote on a resolution at a general meeting on a show of hands every
shareholder present in person, every proxy present who has been duly appointed
by one or more shareholders entitled to vote on the resolution and every
authorised representative of a corporation which is a shareholder of the
Company entitled to vote on the resolution, shall have one vote. If a proxy has
been duly appointed by more than one shareholder and has been instructed by
one or more of those shareholders to vote for the resolution and by one or more
of those shareholders to vote against it, that proxy shall have one vote for and
one vote against the resolution. On a poll, every shareholder present in person
or by proxy shall have one vote for every share held.
A resolution put to the vote at a general meeting shall be decided on a show of
hands unless the notice of the meeting specifies that a poll will be called on
such resolution or a poll is (before the resolution is put to the vote on a show of
hands or on the declaration of the results of the show of hands) directed by the
Chairman or demanded in accordance with the Articles of Association.
If a person fails to give the Company any information required by a notice served
on him by the Company under section 793 of the 2006 Act (which confers upon
public companies the power to require information to be supplied in respect of
a person’s interests in the Company’s shares) then the Company may, no sooner
than 21 days later, and after warning that person, serve a disenfranchisement
notice upon the shareholder registered as the holder of the shares in respect of
which the section 793 notice was given. Unless the information required by the
section 793 notice is given within 14 days, such holder will not be entitled to
receive notice of any general meeting or attend any such meeting of the
Company and shall not be entitled to exercise, either personally or by proxy, the
votes attaching to such shares in respect of which the disenfranchisement notice
has been given unless and until the information required by the section 793
notice has been provided. 
Liquidation
If the Company is wound up the liquidator may, with the sanction of a special
resolution of the Company, and any other sanction required by law, divide
amongst the shareholders the whole or any part of the assets of the Company.
He may, for such purposes, set such value as he deems fair upon any property
to be divided and may determine how such division shall be carried out as
between the shareholders or different classes of shareholders. The liquidator
may also transfer the whole or any part of such assets to trustees to be held in
trust for the benefit of the shareholders. No shareholder can be compelled to
accept any shares or other securities which would give him any liability.
Transfer of shares
There are no specific restrictions on the size of a holding nor on the transfer of
shares, which are both governed by the general provisions of the Articles and
legislation. The Directors are not aware of any agreements between the
Company’s shareholders that may result in restrictions on the transfer of shares
or on voting rights.

Change of control – significant agreements
The following significant agreements contain provisions entitling the counter
parties to exercise termination rights in the event of a change of control in the
Company:
Under the terms of the banking facility agreement detailed in the Financial
Review, if any person, or group of persons acting in concert, gains control of the
Company, Lloyds Bank plc. is no longer obliged to fund any loan and may
cancel its commitment under the facility and declare its participation in all
outstanding loans, together with accrued interest and all other amounts payable

Company has been given notice, executed by a shareholder eligible to vote at
the meeting, of his/her intention to propose such person for election together
with a notice executed by that person of his/her willingness to be elected.
The Company may, by ordinary resolution, of which special notice has been

Annual General Meeting
The Annual General Meeting (‘AGM’) will be held at the offices of Investec, 2
Gresham Street, London EC2V 7QP on Wednesday 9 July 2014 at 12:00 noon. A
letter from the Chairman and the Notice of Meeting (‘Notice’) is made available to
all ordinary shareholders at least 21 working days before the meeting and may be
found at www.ukmail.com.
The routine business of an AGM is to receive and adopt the Director’s Annual
Report and Accounts, to approve the annual statement by the chairman of the
Remuneration Committee together with the annual report on remuneration, to re-
elect directors in respect of those retiring, to appoint auditors and fix their
remuneration and to declare a dividend. 
Additionally, at this year’s AGM, following changes to the Companies Act 2006
(the ‘Act’), the company is required to present the directors’ remuneration policy
to members for separate approval. The policy report, which sets out the
Company’s forward-looking policy on directors’ remuneration, (including the
approach to exit payments to directors), is subject to a binding shareholder vote
by ordinary resolution at least every three years. Once the directors’ remuneration
policy has been approved, all payments made by the Company to the directors
and any former directors must be made in accordance with the policy (unless a
payment has been separately approved by a shareholder resolution). If the
Company wishes to change the directors’ remuneration policy, it will need to put
the revised policy to a shareholder vote again before it can implement the new
policy. If the directors’ remuneration policy remains unchanged, the Act requires
the Company to put the policy to shareholders for approval again no later than the
2017 AGM.
Providing that notice is given to the Company no later than six weeks before an
AGM or no later than the date on which the notice of AGM is given, shareholders
representing at least 5% of the total voting rights of all the shareholders who have
a right to vote at the AGM or at least 100 shareholders who have that right and who
hold shares in the Company on which there has been paid up an average sum per
shareholder of at least £100, may require the Company to include an item in the
business to be dealt with at the AGM. All Directors are requested to attend the
AGM. The Chairmen of the Board and each Board Committee make themselves
available to take questions from ordinary shareholders at the AGM.
44   UK Mail Group plc Directors’ report
Annual General Meeting - special business  
In addition to the routine business of the meeting, the special business set out
below will be transacted. 
Resolution 11
Resolution 11 renews a similar authority given at last year's Annual General
Meeting and, if passed, will authorise the directors to allot shares in the
Company (and to grant such rights) up to an aggregate nominal amount of
£1,526,551.  If given, this authority will expire at the conclusion of the
Company's next Annual General Meeting or on 9 October 2015 (whichever is the
earlier).  It is the directors' intention to renew this authority each year. As at the
date of this document, no ordinary shares are held by the Company in treasury.
This resolution complies with the latest guidance issued by the Association of
British Insurers (the ‘ABI’).
Resolution 12
Generally, if the directors wish to allot new shares or other equity securities
(within the meaning of section 560 of the Companies Act 2006 (‘Act’)) for cash,
then under the Act they must first offer such shares or securities to shareholders
in proportion to their existing holdings.  These statutory pre-emption rights may
be disapplied by shareholders.
Resolution 12, which will be proposed as a special resolution, renews a similar
power given at last year's Annual General Meeting and, if passed, will enable the
directors to allot equity securities for cash up to a maximum aggregate nominal
amount of £273,672 without having to comply with statutory pre-emption rights,
but this power will be limited to allotments:
(a) in connection with a rights issue, open offer or other pre-emptive offer to
ordinary shareholders and to holders of other equity securities (if required
by the rights of those securities or the directors otherwise consider
necessary), but (in accordance with normal practice) subject to such
exclusions or other arrangements, such as for fractional entitlements and
overseas shareholders, as the directors consider necessary; and
(b) in any other case, up to an aggregate nominal amount of £273,672 (which
represents approximately 5% of the issued ordinary share capital of the
Company as at 20 May 2014).
The Company has issued 1,501 ordinary shares in the last year and 40,509
ordinary shares in the last three years on a non pre-emptive basis, representing
0.003% and 0.074%, respectively, of the issued ordinary share capital of the
Company.  This is in line with the 2008 Statement of Principles issued by the
Pre-emption Group which provides that a company should not issue shares
representing more than 5.0% in any period and no more than 7.5% of its issued
ordinary share capital for cash in any rolling three year period, other than on a
pre-emptive basis, without prior consultation with shareholders. 
If given, this power will expire at the conclusion of the Company's next Annual
General Meeting or on 9 October 2015 (whichever is the earlier).  It is the
directors' intention to renew this power each year.
Save for issues of shares in respect of various employee share schemes, the
directors have no current plans to exercise the authorities sought under
resolutions 11 and 12 although they consider their renewal appropriate in order
to take advantage of business opportunities as they arise.
Resolution 13
Resolution 13, which will be proposed as a special resolution, renews a similar
authority given at last year's Annual General Meeting.  If passed, it will allow the
Company to purchase up to 5,473,448 ordinary shares in the market (which
represents approximately 10% of the issued ordinary share capital of the
Company as at 20 May 2014). The minimum and maximum prices for such a
purchase are set out in the resolution.  If given, this authority will expire at the
conclusion of the Company's next Annual General Meeting or on 9 October
2015 (whichever is the earlier).  It is the directors' intention to renew this
authority each year.
The directors have no current intention to exercise the authority sought under
resolution 13 to make market purchases, but consider the authority desirable to
provide maximum flexibility in the management of the Company's capital base.
If passed, the directors will only exercise this authority if they believe that to do
so would result in an increase in earnings per share and would be in the best
interests of the Company and of its shareholders generally. 
The Treasury Shares Regulations allow shares purchased by the Company out of
distributable profits to be held as treasury shares, which may then be cancelled,
sold for cash or used to meet the Company’s obligations under its employee
share schemes. The authority sought by this resolution is intended to apply
equally to shares to be held by the Company as treasury shares in accordance
with the Treasury Shares Regulations.
While held in treasury, the shares are not entitled to receive any dividend or
dividend equivalent (apart from any issue of bonus shares) and have no voting
rights. This power will only be exercised if and when, in the light of market
conditions prevailing at that time, the directors believe that such purchases
would increase earnings per share and would be for the benefits of shareholders
generally. The directors will have regard to institutional shareholder guidelines
which may be in force at the time of any such purchase, holding or re-sale of
shares held in treasury. As at 20 May 2014, the Company holds no ordinary
shares in treasury.
As at 20 May 2014 (being the last practicable date before the publication of this
document), there were options outstanding over 1,245,519 ordinary shares in
the Company (which represents 2.28% of the issued ordinary share capital of the
Company at that date).  If the authority to purchase the Company's ordinary
shares was exercised in full and those shares were subsequently cancelled,
these options would represent 2.53% of the issued ordinary share capital of the
Company.
Resolution 14: Notice period for general meetings
The directors are proposing Resolution 14 set out in the Notice to renew the
authority obtained at last year’s AGM to reduce the notice period for general
meetings (other than AGM’s) to at least 14 days. It is intended that this shorter
notice period will only be used for non-routine business and where it is in the best
interests of shareholders as a whole.
Annual General Meetings will continue to be held on at least 21 clear days' notice.
If given, the approval will be effective until the Company's next Annual General
Meeting, when it is intended that a similar resolution will be proposed.
Note that the changes to the Act mean that, in order to be able to call a general
meeting on less than 21 clear days' notice, the Company must make a means
of electronic voting available to all shareholders for that meeting.

Directors’ report
Statement of directors’ responsibilities
The directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report, the Directors’
Remuneration Report and the financial statements in accordance with applicable
law and regulations.
Company law requires the directors to prepare financial statements for each
financial year. Under that law the directors have prepared the Group and Parent
Company financial statements in accordance with International Financial
Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the European Union. Under
company law the directors must not approve the financial statements unless
they are satisfied that they give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the
Group and the Company and of the profit or loss of the Group for that period.  In
preparing these financial statements, the directors are required to:
� select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently;
� make judgements and accounting estimates that are reasonable and
prudent;
� state whether applicable IFRSs as adopted by the European Union have
been followed, subject to any material departures disclosed and explained
in the financial statements;
� prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis unless it is
inappropriate to presume that the Company will continue in business.
The directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting records that are
sufficient to show and explain the Company’s transactions and disclose with
reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position of the Company and the
Group and enable them to ensure that the financial statements and the Directors’
Remuneration Report comply with the Companies Act 2006 and, as regards the
Group financial statements, Article 4 of the IAS Regulation. They are also
responsible for safeguarding the assets of the Company and the Group and
hence for taking reasonable steps for the prevention and detection of fraud and
other irregularities.
The directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity of the
Company’s website – www.ukmail.com.  Legislation in the United Kingdom
governing the preparation and dissemination of financial statements may differ
from legislation in other jurisdictions.
The directors consider that the Report & Accounts, taken as a whole, is fair,
balanced and understandable and provides the information necessary for
shareholders to assess the Company’s performance, business model and
strategy.
Each of the directors, whose names and functions are listed on page 34 confirm
that, to the best of their knowledge:
� the Group financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance
with IFRSs as adopted by the EU, give a true and fair view of the assets,
liabilities, financial position and profit of the Group; and
� the Strategic Report contained in the Report & Accounts includes a fair
review of the development and performance of the business and the
position of the Group, together with a description of the principal risks and
uncertainties that it faces.
The directors also confirm that:
� so far as they are aware, there is no relevant audit information of which the
Company’s auditors are unaware, and
� they have taken all steps that they ought to have taken as a director in order
to make themselves aware of any relevant audit information and to establish
that the Company’s auditors are aware of that information.
The Directors’ responsibilities statement was approved by a duly authorised
Committee of the Board of Directors on 20 May 2014 and signed on its behalf
by Steven Glew, Company Secretary.

46   UK Mail Group plc Remuneration report
Dear Shareholder,
It gives me great pleasure to present the Remuneration Report for 2013/14.
This year’s report has been prepared in accordance with the new remuneration reporting regime and will be presented to shareholders for approval at the forthcoming
AGM to be held on 9 July 2014. At the AGM, shareholders will have the opportunity to vote on two separate remuneration resolutions as follows:
� a binding vote on the directors’ Remuneration Policy as set out on page 49, which describes the Company’s forward looking remuneration policy which
will operate from 1 April 2014 and will, subject to shareholder approval, become formally effective from the conclusion of the 2014 AGM; and
� an advisory vote on the remainder of the Remuneration Report which covers the Annual Statement and the Annual Report on Remuneration as set out on pages
47 and 57. The Annual Report on Remuneration provides details of the remuneration earned by directors in the year ended 31 March 2014, and how the
remuneration policy for the year ended 31 March 2015 will be applied.
Performance and Reward for 2013/14
As set out in the Financial Review, 2013/14 was a very strong period of growth, driven particularly by strong increases in our parcel volumes. Group PBT of £22.8m
was 28.2% greater than prior year, with operating profits increasing in all of our segments. These financial indicators determine the reward delivered under the annual
bonus plan. As a result of the exceptional performance during the year, bonuses of 77% of the maximum were approved. The Committee believes this payout reflects
the financial performance delivered and the 72% increase in share price over the year.
No awards were made in 2011 under either the LTIP or SMP and thus there are no awards eligible to vest for this financial year. 
Key Committee decisions made in 2014/15
As readers of this report in previous years will be aware, the Committee’s prime aim is to ensure that the Company continues to attract, motivate and retain the highest
calibre individuals to deliver the best possible returns for shareholders. However, after six years of particularly modest salary increases (three of which salaries were
frozen), the fixed pay of the executive directors is now considerably below market levels and therefore out of line with the Company's policy. The Committee believes
now is the right time to address this shortfall and is proposing salary increases of 12.7% and 8% for the CEO and the Group Finance Director respectively. The
Committee has also taken the opportunity to increase pension provisions to that of companies of a similar size to UK Mail.
A second, but nonetheless important objective of the Committee is to ensure that there is close alignment between the interests of directors and those of shareholders.
The Committee aims to achieve this through the linking of short- and long-term incentives to the successful financial performance of the Company, with the potential
to receive competitive levels of total pay only if stretching performance targets are met.
However, following consultation with a number of institutional shareholders, and subsequent review by the Committee, it became apparent that share matching plans
are no longer favoured by investors, and as a result this year will see the last such grant under the plan.
Strategy
In summary, the Committee’s strategy is to set remuneration packages that;
� attract, motivate and retain the best employees;
� reward the achievement of the Groups key short and long-term strategic goals;
� aligns managements interests with the interests of shareholders, and other stakeholders in the Group;
� is weighted towards variable pay, dependent on performance; and
� remains consistent with the Groups risk policies.

Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements
Report & Accounts 47 Remuneration report
Carl Moore’s appointment 
On 8 April 2014, the Company announced the promotion of Carl Moore to the Board as Group Operations Director, having served as the Company’s Operations Director
since 2007. In determining his remuneration, the Committee had demonstrable knowledge of his experience and contribution to the recent success of the Group, and
therefore aligned his package with those of the existing executives, save for ensuring that the policies on termination, included in his service contract, accord with
current best practice.
Further details can be found in the following reports.
Summary
As set out elsewhere in this Annual Report, 2014 has been another successful year for the business.
The Committee believes that the remuneration outcome for 2014 reflects the performance of the business. The Committee is satisfied that the remuneration policy,
which is designed to reward success and to align directors’ interests with shareholders, remains appropriate. As a Committee, we recognise the expectations of
shareholders on executive pay and our history should demonstrate the caution and sensitivity with which we have dealt with such issues.
The Committee unanimously supports the following remuneration policy and therefore recommends shareholders approve the resolutions to be put forward at this
year’s AGM, where I hope to get an opportunity to see you.
Michael Findlay
Chairman of the Remuneration Committee
20 May 2014
This part of the Remuneration Report is unaudited
48   UK Mail Group plc Remuneration report
This report to shareholders has been prepared on behalf of the board by the Remuneration Committee. The Committee adopts the principles of good governance as
set out in the UK Corporate Governance Code (the ‘Code’) and complies with the Listing Rules of the Financial Conduct Authority and the relevant schedules of the
Companies Act 2006 and the Directors’ Remuneration Report Regulations in Schedule 8 to the Large and Medium-sized Companies and Groups (Accounts and
Reports) Regulations 2013.
In accordance with the revised reporting regulations, the report has been split into three sections; the Chairman's Annual Statement, the Remuneration Policy setting
out the policy for the next three year period and the Annual Report on Remuneration which sets out the remuneration paid in respect of the year under review. 
Remuneration Policy Report
The director’s Remuneration Policy, which has been prepared under the new reporting framework, will be subject to a binding vote at the 2014 AGM. If approved, the
policy will be effective as of 9 July 2014, the date of the AGM. The Remuneration Policy is not audited.
The Remuneration Committee 
The constitution and operation of the Committee during the year has complied with the Code’s guidance on directors’ remuneration.
The Committee’s principal duty is the determination of the remuneration packages for the Chairman, the executive directors and the members of the Operating Board.
The Committee’s detailed terms of reference are available on the company website at www.ukmail.com, with the key responsibilities summarised as follows:
� The determination of a senior remuneration strategy that ensures that the senior management of the Company are provided with the appropriate incentives to
encourage enhanced performance, and  are suitably rewarded for their individual contribution to the success of the Company;
� Reviewing the effectiveness of the senior remuneration policy with regard to its impact and compatibility with remuneration policy across the rest of the
Company;
� Ensuring that any contractual terms on termination are fair both to the Company and to the individual, and that failure is not rewarded;
� Ensuring the remuneration policy operates within an acceptable risk profile;
� Approving the design, targets and payments for the Company’s bonus schemes;
� Approving the design, targets and annual awards made for all share incentive plans requiring shareholder approval; and
� Assessing the subsequent achievement of the performance targets in respect of both bonus schemes and share incentive plans.
The Committee is particularly keen to ensure that achievement of the Company’s key strategic and financial goals is encouraged through the design and
implementation of suitably appropriate remuneration packages, thereby aligning executive’s interests with those of all shareholders. 
External trends and best practice are routinely monitored and the Committee welcomes feedback from institutional shareholders, advisory and shareholders
representative bodies.
Remuneration policy
Our remuneration policy is to provide competitive remuneration packages that will recruit, retain and motivate directors and individuals of the required calibre to meet
the Group’s strategic and financial objectives.  The objective is to ensure the policy is appropriate to the Group’s needs and rewards executives for creating shareholder
value. The Committee monitors the Group’s compliance with the Code provisions and institutional investor guidelines for directors’ remuneration.
The policy aims to balance appropriately the fixed and performance-related elements of remuneration.  The latter element is achieved through an annual bonus scheme
and longer term incentives.  The bonus plan rewards the achievements of Group financial or non-financial targets which the Committee and the Board believes are
highly relevant measures of annual performance.  Longer term performance remuneration is delivered through equity-based LTIP schemes which may reward three-
year relative Total Shareholder Return (‘TSR’)’, Earnings per Share (‘EPS’) performance or any other metrics aligned to the Company’s medium to long-term strategy
as determined by the Committee.
The Committee normally reviews the executive directors’ and senior management team’s remuneration annually, against a policy that positions base salaries at
competitive levels.  The variable elements of the package are designed to attract high calibre individuals, motivate outstanding performance and provide executive
directors and the senior management team with the opportunity to earn an overall upper quartile total remuneration package for top quartile performance.  
Details of the individual Executive Directors’ remuneration are described below.
The remuneration policy for non-executive directors is determined by the Board. 
The table below summarises each element of the remuneration policy for the executive directors, explaining how each component operates and how each part links
to the corporate strategy.

Any annual increases awarded are
ordinarily aligned with salary
increases across the company.
Increases beyond those granted to
the wider workforce (in percentage
terms) may be awarded in certain
circumstances such as where there
is a change in responsibility,
progression in the role, or the size
and/or complexity of the Group or
where salaries have fallen well
below the policy positioning for a
sustained period.
Periodic benchmarking may be
undertaken taking account of the
mid-market level in companies of
similar revenues, profits and
market capitalisation.
Ordinarily, salary increases (in
percentage terms) will be in line
with the wider workforce.
However, salary increases may be
made above this level at the
Committee’s discretion to take
account of specific individual
circumstances such as;
- An increase in scope and
responsibilities
- An increase to reflect the
individuals development and
performance in the role (e.g. for a
new appointment where the initial
base salary may be increased over
time rather than set directly by
reference to the previous
incumbent)
- Alignment to the mid-market

The Remuneration Committee may consider it necessary to compensate an individual for the value of any remuneration forfeited on leaving their
current employer. Where this is considered appropriate, the Committee will endeavour to structure this compensation so that it mirrors the terms of
remuneration being replaced in terms of composition, value and timing. In order to facilitate this, the Committee may rely on an exemption in the
Listing Rules which allows for the grant of awards to facilitate, in unusual circumstances, the recruitment of a director.

Incentive plan discretions
The Committee will operate the annual bonus plan and LTIP according to their respective rules, the policy set out above and in accordance with the Listing Rules and
HMRC rules where relevant. 
The Committee, consistent with market practice, retains discretion over a number of areas relating to the operation and administration of these plans. These include
(but are not limited to) the following:
� Who participates in the plans;
� The timing of grant of award and/or payment;
� The size of an award and/or a payment;
� The choice of (and adjustment of) performance measures and targets for each incentive plan in accordance with the policy set out above and the rules of each
plan (including the treatment of delisted companies for the purpose of the TSR Comparator Group);
� Discretion relating to the measurement of performance in the event of a change of control or reconstruction;
� Determination of a good leaver (in addition to any specified categories) for incentive plan purposes based on the rules of each plan and the appropriate treatment
under the plan rules;
� Adjustments required in certain circumstances (e.g. rights issues, corporate restructuring, on a change of control and special dividends).
Any use of the above discretions would, where relevant, be explained in the Annual Report on Remuneration and may, as appropriate, be the subject of consultation
with the Company’s major shareholders.
Detailed Remuneration Policy Report
Base salaries
Base salaries are reviewed annually although not necessarily increased.  In considering appropriate salary levels the Committee takes into account the remuneration
paid by comparable UK companies in terms of market capitalisation, revenues and profits.  The Company’s practice is to target basic salaries by reference to the mid-
market level in the appropriate market for the executive position. However, the Committee will not review external benchmark data in isolation, but will use it as part
of a broader review which considers experience and development in the role, general performance levels and wider wage and inflationary indicators. In forming their
decision, the Committee is mindful of the general increases awarded to the rest of the organisation, and would ordinarily expect to approve a consistent approach.
Annual cash bonuses
The Group operates an annual cash bonus scheme for executive directors. 
Executive director bonuses will be determined by performance against a sliding scale of stretching financial, operational or strategic metrics aligned to the
achievement of the Company’s strategic goals. The level of bonus payment is primarily dependent upon the Group’s performance against financial measures, such
as the budgeted pre-tax profit and operating margin targets, set out at the beginning of the year.
The annual bonus is not pensionable by the Company. The bonus potential for executive directors is ordinarily up to 100% of basic salary for maximum performance.
However, the maximum limit can be extended to 150% of basic salary in exceptional circumstances (e.g. major business initiative).
The annual bonus is subject to clawback (malus) provisions which allow the Committee to recover any undue bonus for reasons of material misstatement of the
Company’s financial results, cessation of employment as a result of misconduct, or administrative error. Clawback applies for two years from the date of payment.
Share plans
Long Term Incentive Plan
The Group’s Long Term Incentive Plan is a key link between executive remuneration and the long-term success and performance of the Group. 
The current plan was approved by shareholders at the AGM in July 2009.  This permits a maximum potential annual award of shares to an executive of 100% of salary
(with the additional flexibility to grant awards worth up to 150% of salary in exceptional circumstances, such as on recruitment).  Shares vest after three years,
conditional upon the satisfaction of relevant performance criteria.  
This part of the Remuneration Report is unaudited
54   UK Mail Group plc Remuneration report
In order to align the interests of participants with those of shareholders, the rules of the plan were amended to allow the Remuneration Committee to determine that
dividends accrue on the shares comprised in the award. The Remuneration Committee can determine that these dividends are satisfied either as shares or as their
cash equivalent, when the award vests to the extent that the performance criteria are achieved.
In 2012, the Remuneration Committee introduced a ‘clawback’ provision whereby the Committee retains the right, in exceptional circumstances, to reclaim any monies
based on financial misstatement and/or the misconduct of an individual through means deemed appropriate to those specific circumstances.
The performance conditions are determined by the Remuneration Committee in advance of the award grant. Performance conditions which determine vesting may
include EPS growth (i.e. on a continuing basis and excluding exceptional items), relative Total Shareholder Return (‘TSR’) compared to an appropriate and relevant
comparator group or any other measures which support the medium to long term strategy of the Company. Where a new metric is introduced, the Committee will
seek to consult with shareholders in advance.
Share Matching Plan
In respect of bonus payable in 2014/15 only, selected senior executives may defer voluntarily up to the lower of 25% of their pre-tax salary or 100% of any pre-tax
bonus received. In return, the executive will receive an award of matching shares under the Share Matching Plan. These awards will vest after three years subject to
EPS performance targets and continued employment.
SAYE Scheme
Executive directors are eligible to participate in the Group’s HMRC approved Sharesave scheme on the same terms as other employees.  Under this scheme,
participants may contribute between £5 and £500 in total each month, for a fixed period of three or five years. Contributions are deducted from net salary. At the end
of the savings period, these funds can be used to purchase ordinary shares in the Company at a discount capped at 20% of the market price set at the grant date.

External Appointments
The Committee believes that where Board members hold directorships in other companies the Company can benefit from their experience.  As a result, and subject
to the Board’s prior approval, executive directors may take on no more than one external directorship and retain any fees earned.
Directors’ Service Contracts and Termination Policy
It is the Company’s policy that, whilst there should not be a fixed duration in respect of directors’ service contracts, each contract contains notice periods of not more
than one year. It is also the Company’s policy that contracts should provide the Company with discretion to terminate employment by making a payment in lieu of
notice. The Chief Executive and Finance Director’s contracts provide for a maximum termination payment of 12 months' remuneration (defined as base salary, bonus,
pension contributions, car allowance and any other benefit then accruing). 
For future director appointments, including the Group Operations Director who became a Board director on 8 April 2014, the Remuneration Committee has previously
determined that any bonus element will be excluded from termination payments, in line with best practice, ensuring that any such compensation does not exceed the
sum of one year’s salary, pension and benefits, and will involve mitigation wherever possible, although the Remuneration Committee would have discretion to award
a pro-rata bonus for part of the year worked based on performance in the year.
Mr Glew’s contract provides that any payment in lieu of notice paid on termination by the Company would consist of an initial payment of six months remuneration.
Thereafter, he would receive a monthly payment at the same annual rate, until the earlier of 12 months, the date he commences employment with a third party or the
date he becomes self-employed.
However, in the event of termination following a change of control, executive directors are entitled to a termination payment of 12 months remuneration.
There are no provisions for any of the executive directors or predetermined compensation in excess of one year’s remuneration. 
The date of each service contract is noted in the table below:
Executive Director Contract date Unexpired term as at 31 March 2014 (or date of appointment if later)
Guy Buswell 31.03.06 12 months
Steven Glew 05.06.06 12 months

period and (ii) the application of a pro-rata reduction. The
Committee may, at its discretion and acting fairly and
reasonably, decide not to apply a pro-rated reduction. Remuneration report
Non-Executive Directors

How Employees' Pay is taken into Account
The Remuneration Committee will consider the remuneration structures elsewhere in the Group when setting pay for the executive directors and in particular by
considering the salary increase levels set for the Group.
Regular updates are provided by the HR function so the Remuneration Committee is kept aware of the policies across the Group. 
No formal consultation with employees is conducted in relation to their views on the current pay policy although general engagement is continually assessed through
employee surveys which include several questions regarding the effectiveness of the current remuneration policy, and ECG feedback.
How Executive Directors' Remuneration Policy Relates to the Wider Group
The remuneration policy summarised in the table above provides an overview of the structure that operates for the Executive Directors and other senior management
levels.
Below this level, the same broad remuneration principles will apply, albeit it with the structure and quantum tailored according to the relevant job grade based on
seniority, level of responsibility and ability to influence overall group performance.
How Shareholders' Views Are Taken Into Account
The Remuneration Committee considers shareholder feedback to be essential in developing a remuneration policy which is fair for both Executives and the Company.
Feedback is collected at each AGM, during meetings held with shareholders from time to time, as well as more general on-going guidance from shareholder
representative bodies.  This feedback is then considered as part of the Company's annual and on-going reviews of remuneration policy.  
The Committee will consult with shareholders if any significant changes in the policy are proposed in the future.
Annual Report on Remuneration
The Annual Report on Remuneration together with the Annual Statement will be subject to an advisory vote at the 2014 AGM.
Implementation of the remuneration policy for 2014/15
As detailed in the notice of meeting, approval of the Committee’s remuneration policy will be sought from shareholders at the Annual General Meeting to be held on
9 July 2014. 
This part of the Remuneration Report is unaudited
Report & Accounts 57
Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements Remuneration report
Subject to approval, the policy will be implemented as follows:
2014/15 2013/14 %
£000 £000 Change
Guy Buswell 375 333 +12.7%
Steven Glew 255 236 +8.0%
Carl Moore 225 -N/a
The Remuneration Committee is fully aware of the continued restraint on executive pay and, in particular, base salaries. This has been reflected by the low increases
applied in the last six years (with salaries frozen on three occasions and increases of 1%, 1.5% and 2% in the other years). However, salaries have now fallen
significantly below the Committee's desired mid-market positioning.
The Remuneration Committee is firmly of the view that retention of the current management team is vital to the continuation of the success of the Company. The
Committee believes that an important factor in securing their retention will be in ensuring that they regard their salary packages, as fair and competitive. The
Committee therefore considered and approved increases in base salaries such that they are more closely aligned with the salaries of executive directors of similarly
sized UK companies and which better reflect the skills and experience of our well-established and highly regarded executive team.
Benefits and pension
Benefits will be provided to executive directors in line with the policy, as follows;
Pension contribution (or
Car or car allowance salary supplement equivalent) 
£ % of base salary
Guy Buswell 12,000 17.5%
Steven Glew 11,000 15.0%
Carl Moore 8,000 15.0%
Increases in pension contributions (or salary supplement) were approved by the Remuneration Committee to more closely align the pension provision of executive
directors in similar sized UK companies. No changes were made to the car or car allowance entitlement.
Annual bonus for 2014/15
As in previous years, the 2014/15 bonus will be determined on a sliding scale of the Group’s actual performance against the following two prime target measures;
Profit before tax – maximum opportunity 80% of base salary
Operating margin – maximum opportunity 20% of base salary
These two measures continue to represent the most important factors in creating value for shareholders, and the use of these measures supports the Committee’s
principles of aligning executive interests with those of the wider shareholder base.
The Committee considers that the target measures are commercially sensitive on a forward looking basis and has therefore chosen not to disclose them at this time.
Full retrospective disclosure of actual achievement, threshold and maximum targets will be included in the Annual Report on Remuneration in 2014/15.
Any bonus received will be payable in cash following the end of the financial year.

Long term incentive awards to be granted in 2014/15
The Committee intends to grant an award to executive and operating Board members in 2014/15 at 100% of base salary, with the following vesting conditions:
For performance between threshold and maximum, awards will vest on a straight line basis.
The Committee considers that these two measures remain the most appropriate measures of long-term performance for the Group, in that they ensure executives are
incentivised and rewarded for the earnings performance of the Group as well as returning value to shareholders.
SMP awards to be granted in 2014/15
To the extent Executive Directors voluntarily defer their bonus (up to the lower of 25% of their pre-tax salary or 100% of their pre-tax bonus) in respect of performance
in 2013/14, a 1:1 matching award will be granted. The award will vest after three years subject to the EPS targets set out below and continued employment.
For performance between threshold and maximum, awards will vest on a straight line basis.
Fees for the non-executive directors

Membership of the Remuneration Committee
The members of the Remuneration Committee during the year were Michael Findlay (Chairman), Bill Spencer and Jessica Burley. All members are independent Non-
Executive Directors and no director plays a part in any discussion directly relating to their own remuneration. 
Advisors to the Committee
During the year the Committee sought advice, from external remuneration consultants, New Bridge Street (‘NBS’), largely as to best market practice and policy, the
setting of suitably challenging targets for the Long Term Incentive Plan, remuneration report drafting and determination of the vesting level in respect of the 2010 LTIP
grant which matured in May 2013. 
NBS also provided sundry administrative services such as the calculation of the Company’s actual TSR performance against the benchmark, actual LTIP vesting levels,
and of the fair values of share awards granted during the year. NBS is a member of the Remuneration Consultants Group and is a signatory to its Code of Conduct.
The Committee is satisfied that there are no potential conflicts. No material additional work has been provided to the Company by either NBS, or any other company
within the Aon plc group of companies, of which NBS is a member.

Performance Graph
The graphs shown below compare the total shareholder return for an investment in the shares of UK Mail with the return for the same investment in the FTSE All-Share
index (excluding Investment Trusts) over a five year and a three year period commencing on 31 March 2009 and 31 March 2011. In the opinion of the Committee,
the FTSE All-Share index, (excluding Investment Trusts), is currently the most appropriate index against which the TSR of UK Mail should be measured and is also
the comparator group used in the Long Term Incentive Plan.

Annual Bonus for 2013/14
The bonus in operation for 2013/14 was subject to sliding scale profit before tax and operating margin targets.
Performance was between Threshold and Maximum for both measures. Therefore total bonus payments were 77% of salary for the Chief Executive and 77% of salary
for the Group Finance Director. The Committee is satisfied that the level of bonus is a fair reward for the performance delivered in the year. 
The directors may defer up to 25% of their pre-tax salary into shares which will attract a matching award under the SMP during 2014/15, the ultimate vesting of which
will be determined by EPS achievement of the Group in the financial year ended 31 March 2017 (see above). However, following feedback from a number of
institutional shareholders, the Remuneration Committee has determined that this will be the last such grant under the plan, before it expires.

UK Mail Group plc
Our opinion
In our opinion:
� the financial statements, defined below, give a true and fair view of the state of the group’s and of the company’s affairs as at 31 March 2014 and of the
group’s profit and the group’s and the company’s cash flows for the year then ended;
� the group financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the 
European Union;
� the company financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the
European Union and as applied in accordance with the provisions of the Companies Act 2006; and
� the financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006 and, as regards the group financial statements,
Article 4 of the IAS Regulation.
This opinion is to be read in the context of what we say in the remainder of this report.
What we have audited
The group financial statements and company financial statements (the “financial statements”), which are prepared by UK Mail Group Plc, comprise:
� the consolidated and company balance sheets as at 31 March 2014;
� the consolidated statement of comprehensive income for the year then ended;
� the consolidated and company statements of cash flows for the year then ended;
� the consolidated and company statements of changes in equity for the year then ended; and
� the notes to the financial statements, which include a summary of significant accounting policies and other explanatory information.
The financial reporting framework that has been applied in their preparation is applicable law and IFRSs as adopted by the European Union and, as regards the company
financial statements, as applied in accordance with the provisions of the Companies Act 2006.
Certain disclosures required by the financial reporting framework have been presented elsewhere in the Report & Accounts (the “Annual Report”), rather than in the
notes to the financial statements. These are cross-referenced from the financial statements and are identified as audited.
What an audit of financial statements involves
We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland) (“ISAs (UK & Ireland)”). An audit involves obtaining evidence about
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements sufficient to give reasonable assurance that the financial statements are free from material misstatement,
whether caused by fraud or error. This includes an assessment of: 
� whether the accounting policies are appropriate to the group’s and the company’s circumstances and have been consistently applied and adequately disclosed; 
� the reasonableness of significant accounting estimates made by the directors; and
� the overall presentation of the financial statements. 
In addition, we read all the financial and non-financial information in the Annual Report to identify material inconsistencies with the audited financial statements and
to identify any information that is apparently materially incorrect based on, or materially inconsistent with, the knowledge acquired by us in the course of performing
the audit. If we become aware of any apparent material misstatements or inconsistencies we consider the implications for our report.
Overview of our audit approach
Materiality
We set certain thresholds for materiality. These helped us to determine the nature, timing and extent of our audit procedures and to evaluate the effect of
misstatements, both individually and on the financial statements as a whole.
Based on our professional judgement, we determined materiality for the group financial statements as a whole to be £1.14 million. This represents approximately 5%
of profit before tax.  We have had regard to profit before tax as we believe this is the most appropriate measure of group performance.
We agreed with the Audit Committee that we would report to them misstatements identified during our audit above £100,000 as well as misstatements below that
amount that, in our view, warranted reporting for qualitative reasons.
Overview of the scope of the audit
The Group consists of two operating subsidiaries and a holding company and reports its results along four business lines being Parcels, Mail, Courier and Pallets.
The Group financial statements are a consolidation of these UK based business lines and a centralised head office function.
In establishing the overall approach to the group audit, we determined the type of work that needed to be performed at each of the operating subsidiaries and the
holding company in order to ensure sufficient appropriate audit evidence had been obtained as a basis for our opinion on the Group financial statements as a whole.
We audited the complete financial information of all three companies, and performed additional audit procedures over the consolidation adjustments in the group
financial statements.
Report & Accounts 67
Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements Areas of particular audit focus
In preparing the financial statements, the directors made a number of subjective judgements, for example in respect of significant accounting estimates that involved
making assumptions and considering future events that are inherently uncertain. We primarily focused our work in these areas by assessing the directors’ judgements
against available evidence, forming our own judgements, and evaluating the disclosures in the financial statements.
In our audit, we tested and examined information, using sampling and other auditing techniques, to the extent we considered necessary to provide a reasonable basis
for us to draw conclusions. We obtained audit evidence through testing the effectiveness of controls, substantive procedures or a combination of both. 
We considered the following areas to be those that required particular focus in the current year. This is not a complete list of all risks or areas of focus identified by
our audit. We discussed these areas of focus with the Audit Committee. Their report on those matters that they considered to be significant issues in relation to the
financial statements is set out on page 38.
Area of focus How the scope of our audit addressed the area of focus
Goodwill impairment assessment
We focused on this area because the determination of whether or not an
impairment charge for goodwill was necessary involved significant
judgements about the future results of the Pallets and Courier segments.
Refer also to note 9 to the financial statements.
We evaluated the directors’ future cash flow forecasts, and the process by
which they were drawn up, including comparing them to the latest Board
approved budgets, recent trading results and reperforming  the underlying
calculations.
We challenged:
� the directors’ key assumptions for long term growth rates in the 
forecasts by comparing them to historical results, economic and 
industry forecasts; and
� the discount rate by assessing the cost of capital for the company
We also performed a sensitivity analysis on these assumptions and the cash
flow forecasts. Having ascertained the extent of change in those
assumptions and cashflow forecasts that either individually or collectively
would be required for the goodwill to be impaired, we considered the
likelihood of such a change in those key assumptions occurring.
We also considered the adequacy of the disclosures made in note 9 to the
financial statements.
Accounting treatment and disclosure of compulsory purchase of
the group’s central hub
We focused on this area as the compulsory purchase of the group’s central
hub and the related compensation is material to the financial statements.
Additionally, there is judgement around the timing of any recognition of
elements of compensation in the statement of comprehensive income,
appropriate classification in the consolidated balance sheet and cash flow
statement.
We read and considered the contract for the compulsory purchase of the
group’s central hub to understand the amount and underlying nature of the
compensation receivable. 
By understanding the nature of the different streams of compensation we
were able to challenge whether the treatment adopted by management was
appropriate in terms of the timing of any amount recognised in the
consolidated statement of comprehensive income and also the
classification of amounts received in the consolidated balance sheet and
cash flow statement.
Our work included assessing the appropriateness of the disclosures made
in the Report & Accounts.
68   UK Mail Group plc
Independent Auditors’ report to the members of 
UK Mail Group plc Area of focus How the scope of our audit addressed the area of focus
Risk of fraud in revenue recognition
ISAs (UK & Ireland) presume there is a risk of fraud in revenue recognition
because of the pressure management may feel to achieve the planned
results.
We focussed on this area due to the risk that revenue could be recorded for
transactions that did not occur.
As the foundation of the evidence we obtained regarding the revenue
recorded in the financial statements, we evaluated the relevant underlying IT
systems and tested the operating effectiveness of internal controls over the
occurrence, accuracy, completeness and timing of revenue recognition for
the Mail, Parcels, Courier and Pallets segments.
We traced revenue transactions to cash receipts or trade receivables and
performed procedures to satisfy ourselves as to the recoverability of those
receivables not yet settled.  We used a combination of data analysis
techniques and other tests, including testing manual journal adjustments, to
identify revenue transactions that resulted in account balances other than
cash or trade receivables, and obtained an understanding of the rationale for
such transactions together with supporting evidence for such entries, where
these were material.
Risk of management override of internal controls
ISAs (UK & Ireland) require that we consider this.
We assessed the overall control environment of the Group, including the
arrangements for staff to “whistle-blow” inappropriate actions, and
interviewed senior management and the Group’s internal audit function. We
examined the significant accounting estimates and judgements relevant to
the financial statements for evidence of bias by the directors that may
represent a risk of material misstatement due to fraud. 
We understood the key trigger points for incentive payments to senior
management and reviewed specific adjustments impacting the financial
statements which involve judgement/discretion by management such as
releases of excess credits and/or accruals.
We also tested journal entries.
Going concern
Under the Listing Rules we are required to review the directors’ statement, set out on page 42, in relation to going concern. We have nothing to report having performed our
review.
As noted in the directors’ statement, the directors have concluded that it is appropriate to prepare the financial statements using the going concern basis of accounting. The going
concern basis presumes that the group and company have adequate resources to remain in operation, and that the directors intend them to do so, for at least one year from the
date the financial statements were signed. As part of our audit we have concluded that the directors’ use of the going concern basis is appropriate.
However, because not all future events or conditions can be predicted, these statements are not a guarantee as to the group’s and company’s ability to continue as a going concern
Opinions on other matters prescribed by the Companies Act 2006
In our opinion:
� the information given in the Strategic Report and the Directors’ Report for the financial year for which the financial statements are prepared is consistent with
the financial statements; and
� the part of the Remuneration Report to be audited has been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 2006.
Other matters on which we are required to report by exception
Adequacy of accounting records and information and explanations received
Under the Companies Act 2006 we are required to report to you if, in our opinion:
� we have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit; or
� adequate accounting records have not been kept by the company, or returns adequate for our audit have not been received from branches not visited by us; or
� the company financial statements and the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited are not in agreement with the accounting records and returns.

We have no exceptions to report arising from this responsibility.
Other information in the Annual Report
Under ISAs (UK & Ireland) we are required to report to you if, in our opinion, information in the Annual Report is:
� materially inconsistent with the information in the audited financial statements; or
� apparently materially incorrect based on, or materially inconsistent with, our knowledge of the group and company acquired in the course of performing our audit; or
� is otherwise misleading.
We have no exceptions to report arising from this responsibility.
Responsibilities for the financial statements and the audit
Our responsibilities and those of the directors

Company statement of changes in equity
for the year ended 31 March 2014
76   UK Mail Group plc Notes to the financial statements
1 Principal accounting policies
Accounting policies for the year ended 31 March 2014
The principal accounting policies adopted in the preparation of these
financial statements are set out below. These policies have been consistently
applied to all the years presented, unless otherwise stated.
General information
UK Mail Group plc (registration 02800218) is a public limited company
incorporated and domiciled in England and the holding company of UK
Mail Limited and UK Pallets Ltd. It is quoted on the London Stock Exchange
(LSE: UKM). The Group’s principal activity is the provision of express
collection and delivery services for parcels, mail and palletised goods. The
address of its registered office is 120 Buckingham Avenue Slough SL1
4LZ.
Basis of preparation
These financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the
Companies Act 2006 and those International Financial Reporting Standards
(IFRSs) as adopted by the European Union and International Financial
Reporting Interpretation Committee (IFRIC) interpretations which are
effective as at 31 March 2014.
The financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost
convention, and on the going concern basis, as described in the going
concern statement in the Directors’ Report on page 42.
New and amended standards adopted by the Group 
There are no IFRSs or IFRIC interpretations that are effective for the first
time for the current financial year that have had a material impact on the
Consolidated or Company Financial Statements of the Group for the year
ended 31 March 2014. 
New standards and interpretations not yet adopted 
New standards, amendments and interpretations issued, effective for the
financial year beginning 1 April 2014 and not yet adopted by the Group
include IAS 27 (revised) ‘Separate financial statements’, IAS 28 (revised)
‘Investments in associates and joint ventures’, and IFRS 10 ‘Consolidated
financial statements’. None of these are expected to have a material effect
on the Consolidated and Company Financial Statements of the Group.
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with IFRS requires the
use of estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of
assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported
amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Although
these estimates are based on management's best knowledge of the
amount, event or actions, actual results ultimately may differ from those
estimates.
The critical accounting judgements and the key sources of estimation
uncertainty are detailed in note 31.
Consolidation
The Group financial statements incorporate the financial statements of UK
Mail Group plc (the ‘Company’) and entities controlled by the Company
(its ‘subsidiaries’) made up to 31 March each year. Control is achieved
where the Company has the power to govern the financial and operating
policies of an investee entity so as to obtain benefits from its activities. 
The financial statements of subsidiaries are consolidated from the date that
control commences to the date control ceases. On acquisition of a
subsidiary, all of the subsidiary's assets and liabilities that exist at the date
of acquisition are recorded at their fair values reflecting their condition at
that date. Changes to those assets and liabilities, and the resulting gains
and losses that arise after the Group has gained control of the subsidiary
are credited or charged to the post acquisition statement of comprehensive
income.
Intra-group transactions and balances are eliminated on consolidation and
consistent accounting policies are used throughout the Group for the
purposes of the consolidation.
The results, assets and liabilities of the franchise network are not
consolidated into the Group's results as the Group does not have a
participating share ownership in the franchises, or the ability to direct and
control their activities. Additionally, the Group does not bear or benefit in
the majority of the risks and rewards.
Advantage has been taken of Section 408 of the Companies Act 2006 not
to include the Company's own statement of comprehensive income. The
profit of the Company for the year was £10.8m (2013: £9.9m).
Goodwill
Goodwill represents the excess of the cost of an acquisition over the fair value of
identifiable net assets of a subsidiary at the date of acquisition. Goodwill is
initially recognised as an asset at cost and is subsequently measured at cost less
any accumulated impairment losses.
Goodwill is allocated to those cash generating units (CGUs) expected to benefit
from the business combination and tested for impairment at least annually or
whenever there is an indication that the asset may be impaired. Impairment
testing is based on assets grouped at the lowest level at which goodwill is
monitored for internal management reporting purposes. Any impairment is
recognised immediately in the statement of comprehensive income and is not
subsequently reversed.
On the disposal of a business, goodwill relating to that business remaining on the
balance sheet is included in the determination of the gain or loss on disposal.
Intangible assets (other than goodwill)
Intangible assets include acquired computer software licences not part of
the operating software acquired with a related piece of hardware. These are
capitalised on the basis of the costs incurred to acquire and bring to use
the specific software. These costs are amortised on a straight line basis
over their estimated useful lives, of between three and seven years, which
are reviewed annually. 
Costs that are directly associated with the development of identifiable and
unique software products generated for use by the Group, and where it is
probable that will generate economic benefits exceeding costs beyond one
year, are recognised as intangible assets. These represent the direct
employment costs of software developers time spent on relevant projects.
Computer software development costs recognised as assets are amortised
over their estimated useful economic lives, of between three and seven
years, which are reviewed annually.
Investment properties
Investment properties comprise of freehold and leasehold land and buildings
held for long term rental yields and are not occupied by the Group.
Investment properties are accounted for under the cost model, at cost less
accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment losses and are
depreciated either over fifty years (in the case of freehold properties), or
over the period of the lease on a straight line basis.
Property, plant and equipment
Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated
depreciation and any impairment in value. Cost includes the original
purchase price of the asset together with the costs attributable to bringing
the asset to its working condition for its intended use.
Where significant parts of an item of property, plant and equipment have
different useful lives, they are accounted for as separate items.
Report & Accounts 77
Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements Notes to the financial statements
Depreciation
Depreciation is provided on a straight line basis so as to write off the cost of
the assets to their residual values over their estimated useful economic life
using the following rates: 
Freehold buildings                                 fifty years
Short leasehold buildings the period of the lease
Motor vehicles, plant and equipment three to ten years
Computer equipment three to seven years
Land is not depreciated
The normal expected useful economic lives and residual values of the
major categories of property, plant and equipment are reviewed annually.
The carrying value of property, plant and equipment is reviewed at least
annually. Any resultant impairment losses are charged immediately to the
statement of comprehensive income.
Impairment
At each balance sheet date, the Group reviews the carrying amount of all
its assets excluding deferred tax assets, inventories, and financial assets to
determine whether there is any indication that any of those assets have
suffered an impairment loss.
An impairment loss is recognised in the statement of comprehensive income
whenever the carrying amount of an asset or its CHU exceeds its recoverable
amount. The recoverable amount is the higher of an asset's fair value less
costs to sell and value in use. In assessing value in use, the estimated future
cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate
that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and risks
specific to that asset. Where it is not possible to estimate the recoverable
amount of an individual asset, the Group estimates the recoverable amount of
the CHU to which the asset belongs. Impairment losses recognised in respect
of CGU’s are allocated first to reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill
allocated to those units, and then to reduce the carrying amount of other
assets in the CHU on a pro-rata basis.
An impairment loss for an individual asset or CHU will be reversed if there
has been a change in estimate used to determine the recoverable amount
since the last impairment loss was recognised and is only reversed to the
extent that the asset’s carrying amount does not exceed the carrying
amount that would have been determined net of amortisation or
depreciation, had no impairment loss been recognised. Impairment of
goodwill is not reversed.
Investments in subsidiaries
Investments in Group undertakings are stated at cost less any provision for
impairment.
The Company reflects the fair value of share-based payments granted to
employees of subsidiary companies as an investment in subsidiaries, with
a corresponding credit to equity.
Inventories
Inventories, represented by fuel stocks held by the Group, are stated at the
lower of cost and net realisable value.
Cost is determined using the first-in-first-out method and net realisable
value is the estimated selling price less costs of disposal in the ordinary
course of business.
Finance and operating leases
Leasing agreements, which transfer to the Group substantially all the risks
and rewards of ownership of an asset, are treated as if the asset has been
purchased outright and are classified as finance leases. The assets are
included in non-current assets and the capital elements of the leasing
commitments are shown as obligations under finance leases. The lease
rentals are treated as consisting of capital and interest elements. The
capital element is applied to reduce the outstanding obligations and the
interest element is charged against profit so as to give constant periodic
rates of charge on the remaining balance outstanding at each accounting
period. Assets held under finance leases are depreciated over the shorter
of the lease term and the useful lives of equivalent owned assets.
Leases where the Group does not retain substantially all the risks and
rewards of ownership of an asset, are classified as operating leases.
Operating lease rental payments, including lease incentives, are
recognised as an expense in the statement of comprehensive income on a
straight line basis over the term of the lease. Similarly, where the Group
acts as a lessor, operating lease income is credited to the statement of
comprehensive income on a straight line basis over the term of the lease.
Revenue
Revenue reflects all sales made by the Group, whether delivered by network
services, franchises or sub-contractors. The Group remains the principal in
all transactions, save where it acts as an agent, on behalf of its customers.
Revenue is recognised in the accounting period in which consignments are
delivered for customers.
Income from investment properties is recognised on a straight line basis over
the term of the lease, even if the payments are not received on such a basis.
All revenues are stated net of value added tax.
Cost of sales
Cost of sales reflects all the direct costs incurred in the collection and
delivery of a consignment, including the costs of sub-contracted and
employed drivers, linehaul costs, and Royal Mail access costs, together
with the direct costs of operating the network. Cost of sales includes the
depreciation cost of network vehicles, cages and site equipment.
Administrative costs
Administrative costs reflect all the establishment and central support costs
of the Group, including the remuneration of non-operational site based staff
and head office personnel, depreciation of buildings, amortisation of
central IT systems and bad debts.
Operating segments
Operating segments are reported in a manner consistent with the internal
reporting provided to the chief operating decision-maker. The chief
operating decision-maker, who is responsible for allocating resources and
assessing performance of the operating segments, has been identified as
the Board of the company.
Taxation
The tax expense represents the sum of the tax currently payable and
deferred tax.
The tax currently payable is based on the taxable profit for the year. Taxable
profit differs from the net profit in the statement of comprehensive income
because it excludes items of income or expense that are taxable or
deductible in other years and it further excludes items that are never taxable
or deductible.
The company provides deferred income tax using the balance sheet liability
method on all temporary differences at the balance sheet date between the
tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts for financial
reporting purposes. Deferred tax assets are recognised for all deductible
temporary differences to the extent that it is probable that taxable profit will
be available against which the deductible temporary differences, carry-
forward of unused tax assets and unused tax losses can be utilised.
Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are measured at the tax rates that
apply to the period when the asset is realised or the liability is settled,
based on tax rates (and tax laws) that have been enacted or substantively
enacted at the balance sheet date.
78   UK Mail Group plc Notes to the financial statements
Full provision is made for deferred taxation on all taxable temporary
differences. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognised separately on
the balance sheet. Deferred tax assets are recognised only to the extent that
they are expected to be recoverable.
Deferred taxation is recognised in the statement of comprehensive income
unless it relates to taxable transactions taken directly to equity, in which
case the deferred tax is also recognised in equity. The deferred tax is
released to the statement of comprehensive income at the same time as the
taxable transaction is recognised in the statement of comprehensive
income. 
Pension costs
The Group operates a defined contribution pension scheme. The assets of
the scheme are held separately from those of the Group in independently
administered funds. The pension costs charged in the statement of
comprehensive income represent contributions payable by the Group to the
scheme together with the administration charges of the scheme. 
Foreign currencies
Transactions in foreign currencies are recorded in sterling at the rate ruling
at the transaction date. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in
foreign currencies are translated at the rate of exchange ruling at the
balance sheet date. All exchange differences arising from trading
transactions are dealt with in the statement of comprehensive income.
Share-based payments
The costs of equity-settled share-based payments are recognised in the
statement of comprehensive income with a corresponding increase in
equity over the vesting period as services are provided to the Group. 
The charge is based on the fair value of the equity instrument granted and
the number of equity instruments that are expected to vest. The fair value
is measured at grant date and takes account of vesting conditions that
relate to the market price of the Company's shares. In order to determine
the value of the instrument a pricing model relevant to the type of
instrument is used.
Provisions
Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present obligation (legal
or constructive) as a result of a past event, it is probable that an outflow of
resources embodying economic benefits will be required to settle the
obligation and a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the
obligation.  
Where the Group expects a provision to be reimbursed, for example under
an insurance contract, the reimbursement is recognised as a separate asset
but only when the reimbursement is virtually certain. 
Contingent liabilities
Contingent liabilities represent possible obligations whose existence will
be confirmed only by the occurrence or non-occurrence of one or more
uncertain future events not wholly under the control of the Group.
Contingent liabilities also include certain obligations that will probably not
lead to an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits, or where the
outflow of resources embodying economic benefits cannot be measured
with sufficient reliability. In accordance with IFRS, contingent liabilities are
not recognised as liabilities.
Exceptional items
Material and non-recurring items of income and expense are disclosed in
the statement of comprehensive income as exceptional items. Examples of
items which may give rise to disclosure as exceptional items include
material gains or losses on the disposal of businesses or non-current
assets, material asset impairments, and business reorganisation and
restructuring costs.
Dividends
Interim dividends are recognised as a distribution from retained earnings in
the period in which they are paid.
Final dividends are recognised as a distribution from retained earnings in
the period in which they are approved at the general meeting.
Share capital
Ordinary shares are classified as equity. Incremental costs directly
attributable to the issue of new shares are shown in equity as a deduction
from the proceeds received. Own equity instruments that are reacquired
(treasury shares) or shares held in the Employee Share Ownership Trust
(ESOT) are deducted from equity. No gain or loss is recognised in the
statement of comprehensive income on the purchase, sale, issue or
cancellation of the Group’s own equity instruments.
Financial instruments
Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognised in the balance sheet
when the Group becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the
instrument. Financial assets are de-recognised when the Group no longer
has the rights to cash flows, the risks and rewards of ownership or control
of the asset. Financial liabilities are de-recognised when the obligation
under the liability is discharged, cancelled or expires.
Trade and other receivables: Trade receivables are recognised initially
at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost using the
effective interest method less provision for impairment. A provision is
made when there is objective evidence that the Group will not be able to
collect the debts. Bad debts are written off to the statement of
comprehensive income when identified.
Trade and other payables: Trade payables are recognised initially at fair
value and subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective
interest method. 
Interest-bearing loans and borrowings: All interest-bearing loans and
borrowings are initially recognised at fair value plus directly attributable
transaction costs. After initial recognition, interest-bearing loans and
borrowings are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the
effective interest method. Amortised cost is calculated by taking into
account any issue costs, and any discount or premium.
Cash and cash equivalents: These comprise cash in hand, current

2 Segmental information
Management has determined the operating segments based on reports that are reviewed by the Board for making strategic decisions. These reports reflect the Group's
defined management structure, whereby distinct managers are accountable to the Board for the results and activities of their identified segments and the different
markets in which they operate. The Board, which is the Group’s chief operating decision maker, considers that the Group has four reportable operating segments.
The Group's operating segments consist of Mail, Parcels, Courier, and Pallets Services. The Board assesses the performance of the operating segments based
on a measure of operating profit before net finance costs and taxation. 
Central costs comprises of network costs and central support costs. Central assets comprise mainly of corporate assets, cash, current and deferred tax balances. 
The Group manages its business segments on a national basis, with all its operations in the UK, as are nearly all of the customers. 
Inter-company transactions, (which are conducted on an arm’s length basis), balances and unrealised gains on transactions between segments are eliminated.
Unrealised losses are also eliminated.
No individual customer accounted for more than 5% of revenue in the periods included in these consolidated financial statements.

8 Earnings per share
Basic earnings per share is calculated by dividing the profit for the year (the 'earnings') attributable to ordinary shareholders by the weighted average number of
ordinary shares outstanding during the year, excluding those held in the employee share ownership trust (note 22), which are treated as cancelled.
For diluted earnings per share, the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue is adjusted to assume conversion of all dilutive potential ordinary shares.
The Group has two classes of dilutive potential ordinary shares: those share options granted to employees where the exercise price is less than the average
market price of the Company's ordinary shares during the year, and the contingently issuable shares under the Group's Long Term Incentive Plan.
Reconciliations of the earnings and weighted average number of shares used in the calculations are set out below.

Group £m £m
Cost and net book value  
At 1 April and 31 March 9.5 9.5
As required under IAS 36 'Impairment of Assets', goodwill has been allocated to the lowest level of cash-generating unit as follows:
2014 2013
Goodwill by segment £m £m
Courier Services 1.6 1.6
Pallet Services 7.9 7.9
Net book value at 31 March 9.5 9.5
The goodwill carried in the Courier Services segment represents goodwill acquired on the acquisition of BXT Limited in February 2003. The Group's courier
operations were consolidated under single management during the year ended 31 March 2007, and as a result are now all reported in the books of UK Mail
Limited.
The goodwill carried in the Pallet Services segment represents goodwill acquired on the acquisition of UK Pallets Ltd in July 2003.
Goodwill is tested for impairment at least annually. The recoverable amount of the CGU is based on a value in use calculation using cash flow forecasts based
on the 2014/15 Budget (as approved by the Board), extrapolated over the following four years in line with the Group's three year plan (as approved by the Board)
and management estimates of the individual CGU's growth rate. Thereafter, the growth rate has assumed to be in line with the anticipated long term GDP rate of
the UK economy. Pre-tax discount rates, derived from the Group's pre-tax weighted average cost of capital are then applied to the projections.
The key assumptions used in testing for impairment are as follows:
- the 2014/15 Budget (year 1)
- the rates of growth in years 2 to 5
- the long-term GDP growth rate of the UK economy
- the pre-tax discount rate used
Budget 2014/15
The 2014/15 Budgets were initially prepared by the management team of each CGU based on their detailed knowledge and experience of their own CGU. These
Budgets have subsequently been approved by the Board, following detailed discussions with management and rigorous testing of the underlying assumptions.
Non-cash items have been added back to profit before interest and taxation in order to determine the cash flow for each CGU.
Rates of growth in years 2 to 5
The rates of growth in years 2 to 5 are based on the Group's approved three year plan (for years 2 and 3), and managements best estimates (for years 4 and 5)
based on past performance,  expectations for future business development, and known business initiatives. The growth rates are in the range of 2.0% to 9.4%
p.a. (2013: 1.5% to 5.4% p.a.)
Long term GDP rate of the UK economy
The anticipated minimum long term GDP growth rate of the UK economy has been estimated at 1.75% p.a. (2013: 1.75% p.a.).
Report & Accounts 85
Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements Notes to the financial statements
Pre-tax discount rate
The discount rate applied to a CGU represents a pre-tax rate that reflects the Group's weighted average cost of capital.
The pre-tax discount rate used is 8.3% (2013:  8.9%).
Sensitivity to changes in assumptions
Impairment testing is dependent on management's estimates and judgements, in particular in relation to the forecasting of future cash flows and the discount
rate applied to those cash flows. Sensitivity analysis has been performed for these key assumptions.
Growth of market and market share
Management has considered the impact of a variance in the growth of the market and market share for each CGU, and believe that there is no reasonable
potential change in any of the key assumptions used that would cause the carrying value of the Courier Services CGU to exceed its recoverable amount.
The value in use calculation for the Pallet Services CGU shows that if the forecasted market growth rates were only 67% achieved, or the discounted cash flows
should fall by 65%, the recoverable amount would be greater than its carrying value.
Pre-tax discount rate
Management has considered the impact of an increase in the pre-tax discount rate applied to this calculation. The value in use calculation shows that if the
pre-tax discount rate was increased to 25%, the recoverable amount of each CGU would still be greater than its carrying value, indicating no impairment.
Market structure
Management believe that there will be no structural changes in either the palletised goods or courier markets which will affect these forecasts.

One (2013: one) investment property is held by the Group, located in the West Midlands, and is being sublet under an operating lease. The lease is due to expire on
23 June 2014. The rental income recognised in the year was £0.3m (2013: £0.3m). Direct operating expenses incurred were £nil (2013: £nil).
The property was valued in March 2013 by the Group Property Manager by reference to recent comparable property transactions in the same area, at £2.4m to £2.5m.
The property was last externally valued by qualified professional valuers working for the company of DTZ Debenham Tie Leung, Chartered Surveyors, acting in the
capacity of External Valuers in December 2010 at £2,445,000. All such valuers are Chartered Surveyors, being members of the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors
('RICS'). DTZ Debenham Tie Leung is a wholly owned subsidiary of DTZ Holdings plc (the 'DTZ Group'), a part of the UGL service group. In the financial year to 30 April
2013, the proportion of total fees payable by the Group to the total fee income of the UGL service group was less than 5%. The valuation was primarily derived using
comparable recent market transactions on arm's length terms. The valuation was carried out in accordance with the RICS Appraisal and Valuation Standards.

20 Deferred tax
Deferred tax is calculated in full on temporary differences under the liability method using a tax rate of 20% (2013: 23%).
The movement on the deferred tax asset account is as shown below:

Credit to equity 0.3 - - -
Credit/(charge) to income statement 0.1 (0.1) - -
At 31 March 0.7 0.3 - -
Deferred tax assets, which largely relate to share based payments, are calculated on the difference between the market price at the balance sheet date and the
option exercise price. The excess of the deferred tax over the cumulative income statement charge is recognised in equity.
There are no unrecognised deferred tax assets.

Lease dilapidations represent the anticipated expenditure resulting from the Group’s contractual obligations to make good properties prior to sub-letting, or reversion of
the lease, in respect of leases expiring within one year and up to 14 years. 
The timing of outflows is variable, and is dependent not only on property lease expiry dates, and opportunities to surrender leases, but repair programmes and the results
of negotiation.
Restructuring relates to provisions arising following a change programme initiated in the financial year ended 31 March 2012 and relates to irrevocable property costs,
which are expected to be utilised within one year and up to three years.

The Company's Employee Share Ownership Trust holds shares in the Company for subsequent transfer to employees under its incentive scheme awards. Shares
held by the Trust are not voted at shareholder meetings and do not accrue dividends. All other shares carry voting rights and accrue dividends.
During the year the ESOT allotted 80,503 ordinary shares of 10p each (2013: 70,978) with an aggregate nominal value of £8,050 (2013: £7,098) to satisfy
exercises under the Group's LTIP and SAYE plans at an average price of 549p per share (2013: 290p per share), and repurchased 31,811 ordinary shares of
10p each (2013: nil) for a total consideration of £163,373 (2013: £nil), following elections by participants to dispose of their shares.

Following the above transactions, the trust held a total of 6,801 shares with a market value of £44,206 at 31 March 2013 (2013: 55,493 shares with a market
value of £210,318).
23 Share-based payments
The Group recognised a charge of £0.9m (2013: £0.1m credit) in respect of equity settled share-based payments during the year. There have been no
cancellations or modifications to any of the plans during the year. The main details of all the schemes which existed during the year are as follows:
Sharesave plan
The Company has offered a SAYE share plan since 1996 to eligible employees, including directors. The plan is an HMRC approved all-employee share plan.
HMRC does not permit performance conditions to be attached to the exercise of options. Under the plan, participants are granted options over the Company's
shares. Each participant may save between £5 and £250 per month to purchase shares in the Company at a discount of up to a maximum 20% of the market
value at the time of the option grant.
Long Term Incentive Plan ('LTIP')
The Remuneration Committee first introduced an LTIP in 2004, as a more effective means of incentivising the Company's senior management than the Executive
Share Option Scheme. Under the LTIP the Remuneration Committee can grant options over shares in the Company to employees of the Company, with a
contractual life of an option being between three and ten years.  
The performance conditions attaching to any future awards granted under the plan were amended at the Annual General Meeting of the Company held on 15
July 2009, such that 50% of an Award is subject to a performance condition based on the Company's annual earnings per share (EPS) growth, and 50% is
determined by the TSR performance of the Company relative to all the other companies in the FTSE All Share Index (excluding Investment Trusts) at the start
of the financial year in which an award is granted over a period of three financial years.
Additionally, in order to further align the interests of participants with those of shareholders, the rules of the plan were amended such that dividends accrue on
the shares comprised within the award. To the extent that awards vest under the performance criteria, the proportionate value of the accrued dividends thereon
will be satisfied as additional shares at the time of vesting.
During the year ended 31 March 2014, the required targets under live LTIP grants were as follows;
(1) Vesting is on a sliding scale between the minimum and maximum points
Awards made under the 2010 grant vested in May 2013 at a 12.65% vesting level having met the threshold TSR condition. However, as the required EPS was
below the required minimum threshold target level, no awards vested under that condition. Successful award holders received a further 1.53% in respect of
their dividend equivalence entitlement.
Share Matching Plan ('SMP')
Under the rules of the SMP , selected executives may be invited to invest a portion of their bonus in the acquisition of Company shares worth up to 25% of their
pre-tax salary. However, as detailed in the Remuneration Policy Report, the Remuneration Committee no longer considers this an appropriate means of
incentivising senior management, with the last grant scheduled for July 2014.
Where such an investment is made, the executives will receive a grant of a matching award over shares in the Company with an equivalent value, which may
be exercised between 36 and 42 months following the date of grant, subject to the achievement of certain EPS performance criteria. Further detail is provided
in the Remuneration Report on page 47.
Calculation of fair values
For equity-settled share-based transactions, fair values of share options awarded in the financial year are measured at the date of grant of the option using a
share pricing option model. Where the model is dependent on the Company's TSR over a period, the Monte Carlo model is used; in all other circumstances
the Black-Scholes model is used. Non-market conditions, such as the Company meeting earnings per share targets, are not incorporated into the calculation
of fair value at the grant date but are reflected in the amount of compensation expense accrued over the vesting period. The expected life of options depends
on the behaviour of option holders, which is incorporated into the option model consistent with historic observable data.

Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements Notes to the financial statements
The fair values calculated are inherently subjective and uncertain due to the assumptions made and the limitations of the option-pricing model used. The
significant assumptions used to estimate the fair value of the options granted in the financial year were as follows:
LTIP LTIP SMP SAYE
Grant date 04/06/2013 16/09/2013 11/06/2013 25/07/2013

Fair value per option £4.58 £4.58 £4.42 £1.50
Expected forfeiture (%) 15.0% 15.0% 0.0% N/a
The risk-free rate was determined by reference to the rate obtainable on UK government securities ('UK Gilts') with maturities commensurate with the expected
term remaining for each award. The expected volatility is estimated by considering the Company's historic average share price volatility over similar periods to
the expected life of the option under consideration. In addition, the expected dividend yield was based at the prevailing rates for the SAYE grants but is assumed
as zero for the LTIP grant given the 'dividend equivalence' term.

24 Financial instruments
The Group's overall objective when managing financial risk is to safeguard its ability to continue as a going concern in order to provide returns for shareholders
and benefits to other stakeholders. Risk management is carried out by a central treasury function under written policies approved by the Board. Under the
supervision of the Group Finance Director, the Group Treasury function identifies and evaluates financial risks in close co-operation with the operating divisions.
The use of simple financial derivatives is considered in order to hedge specific financial risks where cost effective to do so. The Group does not enter into, or
trade, financial instruments, including derivative financial instruments, for speculative purposes. At the year end the Group has not entered into any financial 
derivatives contracts: (2013: £nil.)
Risks are inherent in the use of debt capital, including interest rate risk. Additionally the Group is routinely exposed to a number of other financial risks, including
credit risk, market risk, liquidity risk and capital risk. These are discussed below.
Classification of financial instruments
The tables below set out the Group’s IAS 39 classification for each of its financial assets and liabilities:

Contractual cashflows
The contractual profile of the financial liabilities at 31 March is set out below. The amounts disclosed are the contractual undiscounted cash flows and therefore
include interest cash flows (forecast using LIBOR interest rates as at 31 March in the case of floating rate financial assets
and liabilities). The table also compares the book value and the fair value of the Group’s financial assets and liabilities. Fair value is the amount at which a
financial instrument could be exchanged in an arm's length transaction between informed and willing parties, other than a forced or liquidation sale and
excludes accrued interest.

96   UK Mail Group plc Notes to the financial statements
All financial assets and liabilities stated at fair value in the table above have carrying amounts where the fair value component is a level two fair value
measurement. Level two fair value measurements use inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the relevant asset or liability, either directly or
indirectly.
The fair value of the bank loan approximates to the value reported in the balance sheet since it carries a floating rate where payments are reset to market rates
at intervals less than one year. The value of finance leases is calculated by discounting the contracted cash flows at prevailing interest rates.
All financial assets and liabilities are sterling denominated.
Fair value measurements
The group does not have any material financial instruments held at fair value.
Accordingly, the three level hierarchy required by IFRS has not been presented.
Credit risk
Credit risk is the risk of financial loss to the Group if a customer or counterparty to a financial instrument fails to meet its contractual obligations. These risks
arise principally from the credit exposure to trade receivables, as well as from cash and cash equivalents.
The maximum exposure to credit risk is represented by the book value of each financial asset as recorded in the balance sheet.
Cash and cash equivalents held by the Group include bank balances and short term deposits with a maturity of one week or less. The credit risk on these liquid
funds is limited because in all cases the counterparties are banks with high credit ratings confirmed by international credit-rating agencies.
The Group has no significant concentrations of credit risk. Concentrations of credit risk to trade receivables are limited due to the Group’s customer base being
large and unrelated, with no one customer accounting for more than 7.1% of trade receivables. The Group has implemented policies that require appropriate
credit checks on potential customers before sales commence and strict credit control of outstanding amounts. Trade credit insurance is employed to protect
any significant exposure to bad debts.
Trade receivables that are neither past due nor impaired are expected to be fully recovered as there is no recent history of default or any indications that the
debtors will not meet their payment obligations. At the year end there are no trade receivables (2013: none) whose terms have been renegotiated and would
otherwise be past due or impaired.
Impaired receivables mainly relate to debtors in financial difficulty where defaults in payments have occurred, liability for payment is disputed, or debtors have
entered into bankruptcy. Trade receivables are impaired when there is objective evidence that the Group will not be able to collect all amounts due according
to the original terms. However, the Group expects a portion of these receivables to be recovered.
The Group does not hold any material collateral as security and no assets have been acquired through the exercise of any collateral previously held.
The Group's trade receivables are stated after allowances for bad and doubtful debts, an analysis of which is as follows:

Market risk
Overall, since the vast majority of the Group's activities are provided to UK businesses, the fortunes of the Group are linked to the general health of the UK
economy. The Group's exposure is limited by being spread across a wide range of customers. No customer accounts for more than 5% of revenue.
Price risk
Royal Mail access costs represent a significant cost to the Group. Price risk is limited as Ofcom is mandated to maintain sufficient headroom between retail
and access prices, such that competition is encouraged within the mail industry.
Whilst fuel costs only constitute approximately 3% of total costs there is an element of price risk. Price risk is minimised as significant increases in the fuel
price can be passed onto the majority of customers via a fuel surcharge mechanism common throughout the express delivery industry.
Interest rate risk
The interest risk profile of the Group's interest-earning financial assets and interest-bearing financial liabilities at 31 March 2014 was:
2014 2013

Group Treasury monitor cash and cash equivalent balances on a daily basis, placing surplus funds with approved financial institutions, generally overnight.
Interest receivable is based on a rate linked to the base rate. The Group has additionally made a number of longer term deposits where the interest rate receivable
has been agreed on inception, with the monies being able to be called back at immediate notice without penalty.
The interest rate payable on finance leases is fixed at the inception of any agreement.
The Group has used a sensitivity analysis technique that measures the estimated change to profit before tax and equity of a 1% (100 basis points) difference
in interest rates from the rates applicable at the balance sheet date, with all other variables remaining constant, this being considered a reasonable possible
change to interest rates, that could have affected the Group.
A change of 100 basis points in the average interest rate receivable and payable over the financial year would have increased or decreased profit before tax and
equity for the year, as follows:

Liquidity risk
The Group's business activities, together with the factors likely to affect its future development, performance and position are set out in the Strategic report. The
financial position of the Group, its cash flows, liquidity position and treasury risk management approach are described in the Financial Review on pages 16 to
19, and its borrowing facilities detailed in note 26.
Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group will not be able to meet its financial obligations as they fall due.
The Board reviews both the long and short-term financing requirements of the Group to ensure that there are sufficient available funds both for the day-to-day
operations of the Group and for planned capital investments. The Group has considerable financial resources together with long-term contracts with a wide
range of public and private sector customers and suppliers across different geographic areas and industries. As a consequence, the directors believe that the
Group is well placed to manage its business risks successfully despite the current economic outlook.
As at 31 March 2014, the Group had an undrawn committed overdraft facility of £5m (2013: £5m) in place until 30 June 2014, and an undrawn committed
money market facility of £7m (2013: £7m) in place until 30 November 2014.
Capital risk
The capital structure of the Group consists of debt, cash and cash equivalents and equity attributable to the parent company.  The Group’s policy has been to
maintain a strong capital base in order to maintain investor, creditor and market confidence and to sustain future development of the business. The Board’s
objectives when managing capital are to safeguard the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern in order to provide returns for shareholders and benefits
for other stakeholders and to maintain an optimal capital structure. This includes maintaining the level of dividends at a level commensurate with underlying
operating profitability of the Group and obtaining sufficient short and medium-term debt facilities that are appropriate for the needs of the business.
The Board seeks to maintain a balance between the level of debt (which for these purposes includes finance leases) and the advantages and security afforded
by a sound capital position.
In order to maintain or adjust the capital structure, the Group may adjust the amount of dividends paid to shareholders, return or issue share capital to
shareholders, draw on borrowing facilities, or sell assets to reduce debt.
An analysis of the Group’s net cash/(debt) position is given in note 28.

26 Contingent liabilities
The Company has guaranteed bank and other borrowings of subsidiary undertakings in a cross-guarantee agreement on an undrawn Group borrowing facility
amounting to £12m (2013: £12m).
The Group has a bank guarantee agreement with Lloyds Bank plc, under which the bank provides a facility which allows the Group to request that the bank issue
guarantees to third party suppliers for general business purposes. The maximum total facility value is £11.0m (2013: £10m).  At 31 March 2014, upon the
request of the Group, the bank has issued a guarantee with a value of £8m (2013: £8m) to a third party supplier of a subsidiary company.
The Group has a documentary credit facility with Lloyds Bank plc of £1.4m (2013: £1.7m), in respect of letters of credit opened with the bank.
The Group is subject to litigation from time to time as a result of its activities. The Group establishes provisions in connection with litigation where it has a
present legal or constructive obligation as a result of past events, and where it is more likely than not that an outflow of resources will be required to settle the
obligation and the amount can be reliably estimated. Since these provisions, which are reflected in the Group’s consolidated financial statements, represent
estimates, the final resolution of any such matters could have a material effect on the Group’s operating results and cash flows for a particular reporting period.
27 Capital and other financial commitments
At 31 March 2014, amounts contracted for but not provided in the financial statements amounted to £29.9m (2013: £nil) are as follows:
Total
£m
Assets under the course of construction 17.1
Property, plant and equipment 12.8
Total 29.9
It is anticipated that £29.7m will be incurred within one year, with the remaining £0.2m between one and two years.

102   UK Mail Group plc Notes to the financial statements
31 Critical accounting judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty
The Group's accounting policies are set out in note 1 to these financial statements. Management is required to exercise significant judgement in the application
of these policies. Areas which management believes require the most critical accounting judgements are as follows (apart from those policies involving
estimation which are outlined in (b) below).
a) Critical accounting judgements in applying the Group's accounting policies
Exceptional items
The Directors consider that items of income or expense which are material by virtue of their nature and amount should be disclosed separately if the financial
statements are to fairly present the financial performance of the Group. The Directors label these items collectively as 'exceptional items'.
Determining those transactions which are to be considered exceptional is often a subjective matter. However, circumstances that the Directors believe would
give rise to exceptional items, requiring separate disclosure would include;
(i) loss or cessation of a material contract representing 5% or more of the Group's revenues;
(ii) disposal of non-current assets where the profit or loss represents 5% or more of the Group's profit before tax;
(iii) disposal of investments;
(iv) organisational or restructuring programmes.
Leases
In determining whether a lease is a finance lease or an operating lease, management is required to evaluate where the substantial risks and rewards reside.
Where management conclude that the arrangement constitutes a finance lease, then it is necessary to both calculate the proportion of the payment which should
be treated as finance cost and capital repayment, and to judge the likely period of use at the inception of the agreement.
HS2 accounting
The directors have considered the contractual terms in determining the accounting treatment of the HS2 national hub acquisition and compensation contract.
The key area of judgement include the timing of recognition, specifically in relation to compensation payments, where management assumptions are necessary.
b) Key sources of estimation uncertainty
Estimates and judgements are continually evaluated and are based on historical experience and other factors, including expectations of future events that are
believed to be reasonable under the circumstances.  Management makes estimates and assumptions about the future, which will, by definition, seldom equal
the related actual results. The estimates and assumptions that have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and
liabilities within the next financial year are discussed below.
Useful economic lives of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets
Depreciation of property, plant and equipment and amortisation of intangible assets are charged so as to write down the value of those assets to their residual
value over their respective useful lives. The Directors are required to assess both the useful economic lives of the assets so that depreciation or amortisation
is charged on a systematic and proportionate basis, and their probable residual values.
The Company assesses whether there are any indicators of impairment at each reporting date, or at other times when such indicators exist. When value-in-use
calculations are undertaken, management must estimate the expected future cash flows from the asset.
Share-based payments
The group measures the cost of equity-settled transactions with employees by reference to the fair value of the equity instruments at the date at which they are
granted. Estimating fair value requires determining the most appropriate valuation model for a grant of equity instruments, which is dependent on the terms and
conditions of the grant. This also requires determining the most appropriate inputs to the valuation model including the expected life of the option, volatility
and dividend yield and making assumptions about them.
Further detail of the assumptions used are detailed in note 23.
Goodwill impairment
Goodwill impairment is tested for at least annually, by calculating the estimated recoverable amount from each cash-generating unit ('CGU') on a value-in-use
basis. In performing the test management needs to assess and consider;
(i) the likely sales and cost growth assumptions used by the CGU;
(ii) the sector specific short- and long-term growth rates, as well as that in the UK economy as a whole;
(iii) the pre-tax discount rate applicable to the Company.
The carrying value of goodwill and the key assumptions used in performing the annual impairment assessment are disclosed in note 9.
Report & Accounts 103
Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements Notes to the financial statements
Recoverability of trade receivables
Trade receivables are stated in the balance sheet at their nominal value less any appropriate provision for irrecoverable amounts. In determining whether
provision is required against any trade receivable, judgment is required in estimating the likely levels of recovery. In exercising this judgment, consideration is
given to both the overall economic environment in which a debtor operates, as well as specific indicators that the recovery of the nominal balance may be in
doubt, for example days’ sales outstanding in excess of agreed credit terms or other qualitative information such as historical trend, the Directors also consider
debtor specific circumstances.
Taxation
The Group has, from time to time, deferred tax assets and/or deferred tax liabilities. Judgement is required in the assessment of the future recoverability of
deferred tax assets, as to both quantum and timing, and the probability, timing and size of any deferred tax liabilities that may become payable.
Provisions
The Group has provided for the estimated cost of making good properties on cessation of the lease. This requires the Directors to make an assessment of the
potential cost of the work as at the reporting date. However, these costs will not be immediately incurred and on an on-going basis, the Group maintains its
properties through a programme of repair and renewal which may result in changes required in the carrying value of these provisions.
The Group has previously provided for the estimated costs of re-organisation, which involved making significant estimates for employee termination costs,
onerous lease and other exit costs, and to realisable values of assets made redundant or obsolete. Should the actual amounts differ from these estimates future
results could be materially impacted.

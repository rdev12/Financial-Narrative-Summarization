Business Profile
”Informa delivered a good performance against the 
backdrop of a very challenging trading environment. 
The balance sheet was strengthened, operating margins 
were enhanced through proactive cost management and 
earnings increased.”
– Derek Mapp, Chairman

Our Business
Informa has been built around the provision of high quality, 
proprietary business to business information which includes 
some of the longest-standing brands in the world of 
publishing, conferences, exhibition and training. 
Informa was created from the merger of IBC Group plc and 
LLP (Lloyd’s of London Press) Group plc in December 1998. 
Although Informa only came into being as recently as 1998, 
it has a bloodline running back to 1734 when the first issue 
of the maritime publication Lloyd’s List was pinned to the 
wall of Edward Lloyd’s City of London coffee shop.
Taylor & Francis and Informa merged in May 2004. Taylor 
& Francis has over two centuries of experience and its 
portfolio includes the leading physics and science journal, 
the Philosophical Magazine, which was launched in 1798. 
It has grown very rapidly over the last two decades to 
become a leading international academic publisher, 
especially in the areas of Humanities and Social Sciences. 
Since the merger with Taylor & Francis, Informa has 
expanded through a combination of organic and 
acquisition (both strategic and bolt on) led growth.
In July 2005, Informa acquired IIR Holdings, which was 
founded in 1973. Not only did this allow Informa to 
bring together the two largest events businesses in the 
world to create an undisputed powerhouse, it also meant 
that Informa acquired several market-leading Performance 
Improvement businesses. 
In July 2007, Informa acquired Datamonitor, a  
world-leading provider of premium global business 
information. Datamonitor delivers independent data, 
analysis and opinion across the Automotive, Consumer 
Markets, Energy & Sustainability, Financial Services, 
Logistics & Express, Pharmaceuticals & Healthcare, Retail, 
Sourcing, Technology and Telecoms industries.
The Group’s corporate structure was changed in 
June 2009 by putting in place a new parent company, 
registered in Jersey and with its domicile in Switzerland.
Informa’s website www.informa.com provides more 
information on the history of the Group and each of 
its divisions.

n umber 1 journal in the Urban Studies category
Journal of the American Planning Association 
(JAPA) has been one of Routledge’s most 
successful recent acquisitions. Ranked the 
Number 1 journal in the Urban Studies category 
in the Thomson Reuters Journal Citation 
Reports® for the past two years, the journal’s 
impact factor has increased by approximately 
46%, in that time to 2.250.  Journal Citation 
Reports® (JCR®) offer a systematic, objective 
means to critically evaluate the world’s 
leading journals, with quantifiable, statistical 
information based on citation data. To celebrate 
the Association’s hundredth birthday in 2009 
Routledge digitized JAPA’s entire archive and 
published a well-received, widely read and cited 
special centennial issue.
22,000
titles available  
digitally
Building on two centuries’ experience, Taylor & Francis 
has grown rapidly over the last two decades to become 
a leading international academic publisher. The Taylor 
& Francis Group operates from a network of global 
offices, including New York, Philadelphia, Florida, 
Oxford, Melbourne, Stockholm, Beijing, New Delhi, 
Johannesburg, Singapore and Tokyo, plus a larger 
network of sales offices and distributors. 
In 2009 Taylor & Francis secured a large number of new 
society contracts for 2010. The titles range in subject 
from Journal of the Musical Arts in Africa to the Journal 
of Systematic Palaeontology. Of particular note is a 
co-publishing partnership with the Royal Society of 
New Zealand for its journals including an archive of 
over three hundred years of important science content 
covering New Zealand research specialities such as the 
geosciences, botany, agriculture, marine science and 
zoology and the publication of the journal Housing Policy 
Debate which is one of the world’s most respected and 
highly ranked housing journals.
2009 has been an excellent year with continued growth 
in revenues, profits and product volumes. Electronic 
delivery is going from strength to strength with growth 
in electronic book revenues of 33%. There are now 
22,000 titles available digitally either as e-books or 
on databases. This is allowing the business to deliver 
products to the customer rapidly, in their choice of 
format and with great cost efficiency.

83%
of Lloyd’s List customers  
now use its online offering
The Professional & Commercial Information (PCI) division 
incorporates a number of products oriented towards 
the corporate market, including the vertical sectors 
of telecoms & media, life sciences & pharmaceutical, 
financial markets, maritime & insurance and commodities. 
The product format within PCI varies from the Lloyd’s 
List daily newspaper and Scrip News to deep knowledge 
databases such as Datamonitor with its ten Knowledge 
Centers, Citeline for the clinical trials customer and EMC 
for telecoms trends and forecasting. Informa Global 
Markets provides real time news, data and analysis 
electronically across a number of markets 24 hours a day.
Digital delivery remains at the forefront of the PCI 
division’s strategy in 2009. The year saw a number of  
key new launches and many upgrades and relaunches  
of our online news and data services. 
Initiatives such as the new Lloyd’s List Intelligence and 
the newly amalgamated InformaHealthcare.com have 
resulted in significantly improved customer usage, higher 
customer value and increased subscription yields.
The PCI division’s revenues include group advertising  
sales which remain low in relation to the overall  
group position. The excellent quality of need to  
have information which the division provides has 
enabled the business to maintain high subscription 
renewal rates core to the division’s strategy.

The Datamonitor Group’s retail arm, Verdict Research, 
celebrated its 25th anniversary in 2009. The UK’s leading 
authority on the retail industry, Verdict continues to 
publish unrivalled independent analysis and has come  
a long way since publishing its first report in 1984 on 
grocers and supermarkets.
Based on the world’s definitive online database of shipping 
movements and company financial performance data, Lloyd’s 
List Intelligence has been under construction throughout 2009. 
Its predecessor, Lloyd’s MIU, performed strongly last year as 
executives turned to trusted data on which to base difficult 
business decisions.

main events :
The largest events in 2009 include  
Arab Health, Monaco Yacht Show,  
The SuperReturn Series, the Com Series 
(Telecoms) and German Energy.
Events and training remains the most cyclical division 
of the Informa portfolio. The top 200 events contributed 
28% of the overall events and training revenues in 2009. 
Our largest events including Arab Health, the Monaco 
Yacht Show, The SuperReturn series, the Com series 
(Telecoms) and German Energy, all performed well and 
are expected to do so again in 2010.
Exhibitions and large conferences remain one of the 
best ways of marketing products, garnering intelligence, 
debating industry issues and networking. The geo-
cloning of events continues with the successful launch  
of Cityscape Saudi Arabia and a number of other events  
in the pipeline.
The smaller events businesses, based around regional 
hubs are found throughout Europe, US, the BRIC countries, 
South Africa and Australia and are well placed to take 
advantage of their high operational gearing when the 
economy recovers in their various locations.

STRENgTh:
Informa is in a stronger position 
than it was this time last year to deal 
with challenges and also benefit 
from the multiple opportunities 
available to the Group.
– Derek Mapp, Chairman
Despite 2009 being an extremely tough year for 
the world economy, I am pleased to report a good 
performance from Informa over the last 12 months.
It was an extremely demanding year, but one which 
brought to the fore some of the key characteristics 
of Informa. Three features stand out:
the resilience of our portfolio of assets diversified •	
across vertical markets and geographies;
the operational flexibility of our business, which •	
allowed us to continue to protect margins through 
prompt cutting of costs; and
the entrepreneurial spirit of our people who pursued •	
new opportunities even as market conditions 
remained uncertain.
Revenue for the year ended 31 December 2009 was 
£1.22bn down only 4% on 2008. Adjusted operating 
profits were £309.5m, up 1% on 2008. The adjusted 
operating margin improved accordingly from 23.9% to 
25.3% and adjusted cash conversion was 105%. Our free 
cash flow during 2009 was £223.8m – up 6.6% on 2008. 
On an organic basis, revenues declined by 14% with 
publishing up 2% and events and training down 27%, 
partly driven by our pro-active reduction of the number 
of events we run. Organic adjusted operating profits 
declined by 12%, with an increase in publishing of 8% 
offset by a 41% decline across events and training.
Profit before taxation decreased to £96.5m (2008: 
£109.0m) as a result of the cost of restructuring during the 
year whilst basic earnings per share increased by 12% to 
18.8p (2008: 16.8p restated). Adjusted diluted earnings 
per share increased to 34.3p (2008: 33.9p restated).
In order to strengthen our balance sheet and remove any 
market concerns about our ability to finance our business 
within current banking covenants we launched a rights 
issue in May, raising a net £242m. We ended the year 
with net debt of £872.6m (2008: £1,341.8m) and a net 
debt to EBITDA multiple of 2.7 times against a covenant 
of 3.5 times. It is our intention to trade between 2.0 and 
2.5 times going forward, a level which is in line with 
investment grade parameters for credit managers. 
By the start of 2009 it was apparent that economic conditions 
were challenging and would continue to negatively impact 
trading. As such we managed the business to protect 
profitability, optimise cash generation and take swift action 
c ha IRman’s statement 15 Informa plc Annual Report & Financial Statements for the year ended 31 December 2009
on head count and other variable costs. During the year 
we reduced staff numbers by a further 8%, which drove 
an annualised cost saving of £40m. We reacted quickly 
to falling demand in the events business and reduced 
events output by a quarter which in itself was responsible 
for half of the drop in events revenue. Where appropriate, 
we have also restructured our publishing businesses, 
consolidating operations and reducing the cost base.
We looked at all cost lines but were careful to leave 
the core of our business intact and we have continued 
to invest both vertically and geographically where 
trading conditions warranted it. We were able 
to react very quickly to the downturn given our 
variable cost base and we are in a strong position 
to take advantage of an upturn when it comes. 
We continue to look closely at our business portfolio 
to find opportunities to bolster certain areas through 
investment. Informa has a strong track record of 
generating value through the effective integration of 
acquisitions of all sizes. Looking forward into 2010 and 
beyond we will continue to make small bolt on acquisitions 
which fulfil our strict investment criteria. We also seek to 
divest of businesses that do not fit our long-term strategy.  
We have continued to respond to client demands 
for information delivered digitally. Of our publishing 
revenues in 2009, 72% came from digital sources across 
all of our major verticals. 64% of publishing revenues are 
subscription led and we have largely moved from a legacy 
single subscriber business to corporate site licences, which 
now form the majority of our subscription business. In 
2009, publishing contributed 72% of total profits, while 
less than 3% of our total revenues come from advertising. 
Our strategy is to continue to develop a strong, high 
margin information business which is resilient in 
the downturn but will have appropriate operational 
gearing in the up cycle. We have high internal 
standards for cash control, strong corporate 
governance, strict management controls, allied with 
the necessity to be innovative and entrepreneurial. 
During 2009 we launched the Abu Dhabi Yacht 
Show, established a new business venture in Saudi 
Arabia, opened an exhibition business alongside our 
conference operations in Brazil, invested in our Academic 
content platform, grew our telecommunications Com 
series of events worldwide (especially in emerging 
markets) and continued to develop our various Clinical 
Research publishing and events businesses. Similar 
initiatives and new activity continue into 2010.
We are recommending a second interim dividend of 7.85p 
per share. This will be paid on 19 May 2010 to shareholders 
on the register on 16 April 2010. It will make a total 
dividend for 2009 of 11.45p per share as against 8.41p per 
share (restated) in 2008, an increase of 36%.
For almost all businesses, 2009 has been one of the 
toughest years they have ever experienced. Informa is 
no exception, but we have performed well due to the 
actions taken within the business and the nature of our 
activities with their variety of vertical markets, multi-
geographies, media formats, allied with strong cash 
generation, good cost control and high margins. However, 
our resilience and strength could not have been achieved 
without the support of our people in every part of the 
business. Despite cost cuts and, in certain instances,  
lower incomes, every person in Informa has given their all. 
I would like to thank and congratulate every one of them 
on behalf of the Board and the shareholders.
Future Prospects
The economic background remains uncertain and 
markets are unpredictable. We remain cautious and are 
running our businesses accordingly. However, Informa 
is in a stronger position than it was this time last year to 
deal with challenges and also benefit from the multiple 
opportunities available to the Group.
Academic journal and other subscription renewals are in 
line with our expectations. Our UAE-based exhibitions in 
the first few months of 2010 have grown over last year and 
on the conference side, our larger events such as the major 
German Energy Event and SuperReturn International 
have performed well. The short-term outlook for our more 
cyclical smaller conferences remains flat but the business 
is well positioned for the economic upswing.
With considerable cost removed from the business we  
are well placed to maximise the opportunities to grow 
as and when they arise. Our portfolio of assets is well 
balanced across vertical markets and geographies. We 
are pushing ahead with innovative ways to enhance 
our customer offering and further develop an already 
strong digital capability.

ExCEPTiONAl PREFORmANCE:
72% of publishing revenues are delivered 
in digital format which represents 39% of 
Group revenues.
– Peter Rigby, Chief Executive
Publishing
During a period of sustained economic decline 
across the world, our Publishing assets have 
performed exceptionally well. Our focus on 
digitally delivered, subscription-led, must have 
proprietary content has enabled us to avoid 
significant reductions in demand albeit with some 
vertical markets performing better than others.
Revenues grew by 8.6% (1.7% on an organic basis) 
and overall publishing now accounts for 54% of Group 
revenues and 72% of Group adjusted operating profits.
a cademic Information (a I)
Our AI division delivered organic revenue growth of 
6.5% and organic adjusted operating profit growth of 
7.8%, testament to the resilience of its products. We 
are particularly pleased with the performance of our 
books business. Our portfolio of products – textbooks, 
monographs and reference works – delivered its best ever 
performance as we saw our global sales and marketing 
network sell over 5.6m books in 2009. We saw excellent 
growth especially in the faster developing Asia regions. 
During the year we established a print on demand (POD) 
partner in our own Kentucky distribution facility to improve 
our control over the print supply chain. Over 25,000 titles 
are now available as POD with overall stock levels being 
reduced as a consequence of our continuing emphasis on 
printing shorter run quantities. We have significantly grown 
our electronic book business revenues by 33% with 22,000 
titles available digitally either as e-books or on databases. 
We watch with interest the introduction of new electronic 
readers and are well placed to take further advantage of this 
new format if it develops in the academic sector.
We launched 26 new journals and continue to have a 
real strength in the growing areas of research which 
include humanities, social sciences, environment and 
agriculture. “Must have” content in academic journals is 
tracked by citations and we continue to see more and 
more of our titles gaining recognition, testament to our 
partnership with editors, societies and academics.

We have worked hard to enhance the value of our offering 
to our customers and have tempered our pricing policy to 
reflect what is happening in academic budgets worldwide. 
We started the journal renewal process for 2010 earlier in 
the final quarter of 2009 than last year, which along with 
considerable systems development and working closely 
with our customers has resulted in our processed orders 
being higher this year than they were a year ago. Despite 
the challenging academic market conditions we anticipate 
that renewal rates will not be materially affected in 2010.
Professional & c ommercial Information (Pc I)
PCI which comprises publishing across healthcare, 
maritime, pharmaceutical, commodities, professional 
and financial sectors, as well as Datamonitor, delivered 
revenues which were down 2% on an organic basis 
but by working extremely hard on costs delivered 
organic adjusted operating profit growth of 8.6%.
This part of our business generates 72% of its revenue 
from subscriptions, 84% of its revenue digitally 
and has some of the highest margins in the Group. 
Being diversified not just geographically but across 
sectors, we witnessed a strong performance across 
pharma and life sciences, whilst financial services 
was a much tougher area as banks consolidated, 
disappeared or simply reduced their headcount.
Renewal rates were robust across PCI including 
Datamonitor, where the number of high value 
subscribers was maintained. 
It was difficult to grow revenues during 2009 but by 
anticipating this and taking cost out of the business, we 
increased adjusted operating margins by 4.2 percentage 
points to 32.2%. Our portfolio of products covers many 
niche areas across numerous different vertical markets. 
We focus on key accounts and delivering content with 
deep intelligence direct to the customers’ workplace. 
Informa Business Information, part of PCI, will push 
ahead in 2010 developing essential, high-value online 
information and intelligence services in its markets. In 
maritime, the Lloyd’s List Group, comprising not only 
the newspaper but the online offering (used by 83% 
of its customers), databases, maritime law reports, 
finance and insurance services, has been transformed 
over the past two years by focusing on customer 
needs and utilising technology to improve delivery.
Within our financial data businesses (IFI) we have 
inevitably lost customers over the past eighteen months 
as the financial markets collapsed. Yet all four businesses 
increased adjusted operating profits and we secured 
some important customers wins. We anticipate another 
tough year but IFI is protected because it comprises 
electronically delivered data, is subscription led and 
enjoys very high margins.
Datamonitor has continued to expand its presence 
around the world. New customers and renewals have 
taken longer to secure but we have been able to 
supplement revenue with one off reports as well as one 
or two large consulting projects. The investment in our 
Knowledge Centers has improved the offering and we 
have restructured our suite of IT products which was the 
most challenging sector in 2009. We have targeted those 
sectors where we believe there are significant growth 
opportunities such as energy and healthcare.
A lot of cost has been taken out of the business but we 
have also reinvested in global sales teams as we look to 
expand our reach. Datamonitor’s integration into Informa 
and our office network and databases has enhanced its 
access to new geographical territories. Whilst markets 
remain difficult, we are encouraged by how well 
Datamonitor has performed this year.
Our portfolio of market leading brands, including Scrip, 
Lloyd’s List, TrialTrove, Insurance Day, IGM, Food News, 
SeaSearcher and Datamonitor gives us confidence that 
we can continue to deliver deep, content led intelligence, 
increasingly in an online format focusing on end-users in 
high value markets.
events & t raining
When we reflect on the past eighteen months and the 
nature of our Events and Training business which accounts 
for 46% of Group revenues and 28% of Group adjusted 
operating profits, it has delivered an extraordinary result. 
We have lost revenues of £108.8m, around half due to us 
pro-actively taking product out of the market, and yet 
protected the bottom line to the extent that adjusted 
operating profits only fell by £40.4m. We still achieved an 
adjusted operating profit margin of 15.5%. Informa plc Annual Report & Financial Statements for the year ended 31 December 2009 18
t he Year in Review
Our exhibitions and large conferences were resilient. 
Our largest events including Arab Health, the Monaco 
Yacht Show, SuperReturn, the Com series (Telecoms), all 
performed well and we expect them to do so again in 2010.
The most challenging areas were local language 
conferences and training courses, as corporate budgets 
were cut. We reacted quickly to reduce volume and costs. 
The cost base is very flexible and we are confident we can 
accommodate increased demand before we need to put 
cost back into the business.
Geographically, the picture was similar everywhere for 
conferences. Europe, and in particular our large German 
operations, were hit hard but it was a similar trend in 
the US, Middle East and Australia. We would expect each 
region to bounce back in line with the recovery in their 
respective economies. In anticipation of this, we are 
working hard on new products and topic development 
and making our training materials easier to access and 
more flexible for the corporate landscape.
Our corporate training portfolio had a stronger end 
to the year but has suffered significantly over the past 
eighteen months. It was one of the first businesses to 
be impacted by the recession and may take a while to 
recover. However, with significant cost taken out of the 
business, any pick-up in demand, particularly in the US, 
will result in a materially improved performance.
There were still some notable successes despite the 
difficult environment which indicates the quality of  
our businesses:
Dubai exhibitions excluding Cityscape increased •	
revenues by 18%;
Telecoms, where the revenues from our Com World •	
Series of events were up 12%;
Vitafoods increased revenues by 32%; •	
Monaco Yacht Show increased revenues by 3%; •	
AusRail, where revenues were up by 14%; and •	
Our Life Sciences events business delivered profits  •	
in line with 2008.
The top 200 events contribute 28% of overall Events 
and Training revenues and around 55% of adjusted 
operating profit.
Participating in a market leading exhibition or 
large conference remains one of the best ways for a 
company to market their product, garner intelligence, 
debate industry issues and network. This is evidenced 
by Arab Health which ran in January 2010 with revenue 
20% up year on year or SuperReturn International which 
ran last month with over 1,000 delegates. Our forward 
bookings for the rest of our shows in 2010 are slightly 
ahead of last year.
The final quarter of 2009 showed a degree of stability 
amongst our Event and Training operations. This has 
continued in 2010 and we are working hard to ensure our 
portfolio meets the needs of our customers and markets. 
We are looking to build on our existing exhibition 
portfolio through supersizing and geo-cloning existing 
events, new launches and small bolt-on acquisitions.

CONTiNuED PROFiT:
As well as the increase in adjusted 
operating profit, we are pleased by the 
way the Group has continued to convert 
profit into cash. Free cash flow generated 
by the Group was £223.8m up 7%.
– Adam Walker, Finance Director
2009 will be remembered as one of the most difficult 
years from a global trading perspective. All of our 
businesses were impacted to a lesser or greater extent, 
so we are pleased with these financial results which 
demonstrate the strength of a balanced portfolio and  
an ability to manage costs proactively when demand  
is reduced.
Adjusted operating profit increased to £309.5m  
(2008: £305.8m) driven by an increase in the adjusted 
operating margin from 23.9% to 25.3%. The increase in 
adjusted operating profit and margin demonstrates the 
benefits of our early actions to adapt our cost base to 
the very challenging trading conditions. These actions 
offset a 4% reduction in 2009 revenues to £1,222m 
(2008: £1,278m).
As well as the increase in adjusted operating profit,  
we are pleased by the way the Group has continued  
to convert profit into cash. Free cash flow generated  
by the Group was £223.8m up 7%.
a djusted and s tatutory Results
In this Financial Review we refer to adjusted and 
statutory results. Adjusted results are prepared to provide 
a more comparable indication of the Group’s underlying 
business performance.
t ranslation Impact
The Group generates the majority of its revenue  
overseas, and with most currencies strengthening 
against sterling over the year, there was a benefit to the 
2009 revenue and adjusted operating profits over 2008  
of approximately £120m and £40m respectively.
The largest exposure is to US dollars with approximately 
45% of Group revenue generated in USD and currencies 
pegged to the USD. Each 1 cent movement in the USD to 
GBP exchange rate has a circa £3.5m impact on revenue 
and a circa £1.1m impact on operating profits. Offsetting 
any negative impact on operating profits are decreases  
to interest payable and tax payable. 
For bank debt covenant testing purposes, profit and  
debt translation is calculated at the average rate of 
exchange throughout the relevant period.

Revenue declined by 4%, despite the translation benefit of both US dollar and Euro to sterling currency movements 
increasing revenue by approximately £120m over 2008. There were no material acquisitions made during 
2009. Organic revenue declined by 14% reflecting a strong performance in our publishing businesses, up 2%, but 
emphasising the tough trading environment for Events and Training businesses, where revenues declined by 27%.  
We proactively removed around a quarter of events, principally training courses and similar local language 
conferences, from our portfolio due to reduced levels of demand. Large scale events held up well.

o perating Profit
Adjusted operating profit increased marginally to £309.5m (2008: £305.8m). 
Organic adjusted operating profit declined by 12%, with an increase of 8% by the publishing businesses offset by a 41% fall 
at events and training. The events and training businesses have a significant element of variable cost, including profit share, 
which for some people is the largest part of their remuneration. This has ensured that business unit heads are focused on 
cost containment at all times, ensuring a swift response to the dramatic fall in business demand. Consequently, although 
their revenue declined by £108.8m, by reducing the cost base the fall in profits was restricted to £40.4m. This shows the 
operational gearing within events and training where we anticipate an opposite effect when economic conditions improve. 
Statutory operating profit declined by 11% to £145.7m (2008: £164.6m), resulting principally from the decline in 
revenue and the £16.8m increase in restructuring and reorganisation costs.
Restructuring and Reorganisation c osts
Restructuring and reorganisation costs for the year of £34.1m (2008: £17.3m) largely reflect the cost to the businesses 
of responding to changing market conditions and of the corporate redomicile. These include redundancy costs of 
£18.0m (2008: £9.9m), vacant property provisions of £4.7m (2008: £3.6m), reorganisation costs of £5.0m (2008: £1.4m), 
and aborted acquisition costs of £2.1m (2008: £0.6m). In addition, we incurred £4.3m (2008: £nil) of professional fees  
in connection with the redomicile of the ultimate parent company.
The £27.7m of restructuring costs are expected to deliver annualised savings of approximately £40m.
n et Finance c osts
Finance costs net of interest receivable, decreased by £24.2m to £48.2m mainly as a result of the decline in market interest 
rates and the reduction in debt resulting from the net proceeds of the rights issue (£242m) received in May 2009.
Around 75% of our borrowings are hedged through fixed interest rate swaps. At 31 December 2009 the weighted 
average life of the swaps was 1.5 years with a weighted average interest rate of 4.93%.
Profit Before tax
Adjusted profit before tax increased by 12% to £261.3m (2008: £233.4m) and adjusted profit for the year also increased 
by 12% to £193.1m (2008: £172.5m).
taxation
Across the Group, tax has been provided on adjusted profits at an adjusted tax rate of 26.1% (2008: 26.1%). This adjusted 
tax rate benefits from profits generated in low tax jurisdictions.
The Group tax credit on statutory profit before tax was 10.4% (2008: charge 21.1%). The restructuring of the group has resulted 
in the release of a £34.3m deferred tax liability for the difference between the accounting and tax value of certain group assets.
earnings and Dividend
Statutory diluted EPS of 18.83p (2008: 16.79p restated) is 12% ahead of 2008 and adjusted diluted EPS of 34.27p  
(2008: 33.92p restated) is 1% ahead of 2008.
The Board has proposed a second interim dividend of 7.85p per share (2008: 3.28p per share restated), in line with the 
Group’s existing dividend policy. This dividend will be paid on 19 May 2010 to ordinary shareholders registered as of 
the close of business on 16 April 2010. This will result in a total dividend for the year of 11.45p per share (2008: 8.41p 
per share restated). Dividend cover will be 3 times on an adjusted earnings basis.
The 2008 comparative per share earnings and dividend numbers have been restated to reflect the bonus element  
of the rights issue. Informa plc Annual Report & Financial Statements for the year ended 31 December 2009 22
t he Year in Review
Return on c apital employed
The Group has undertaken three significant transactions in recent years – the merger with Taylor and Francis and the 
acquisitions of IIR and Datamonitor. In addition, a number of smaller bolt on acquisitions have also been completed. 
Adjusted operating profits, on a proforma basis, have grown on a compound basis by 14% per annum over the past ten 
years of which around half is organic growth with the balance driven by acquisitions.
The return on capital employed over this period is 8.9%, ahead of the Group’s current weighted average cost of capital. 
c ash Flow
The Group continues to generate strong cash flows and this is reflected in a cash conversion rate, expressed as a ratio of

from the sale of assets, the Group generated free cash flow of £223.8m (2008: £210.0m). This demonstrates the ability 
of the Group to deleverage quickly.
FInanc Ial R ev Iew continued 23 Informa plc Annual Report & Financial Statements for the year ended 31 December 2009
The change to net debt arising from acquisitions (net of disposals) was a £38.5m outflow (2008: £13.6m inflow) which 
comprises current year acquisitions of £13.2m (2008: £5.7m) and consideration in respect of acquisitions completed 
in prior years of £25.3m (2008: £10.6m). There were no material disposals during the year (2008: £29.9m). In the prior 
year the Group disposed of its interest in Map of Medicine for net cash consideration of £33.6m generating a gain on 
disposal of £17.8m profit on disposal. We have robust criteria for assessing acquisitions and we target acquisitions and 
alliances that accelerate our strategic development and meet our financial criteria.
Net debt decreased by £469.2m from £1,341.8m to £872.6m reflecting cash flow of £399.4m, including the rights issue 
net proceeds of £242m, and favourable exchange movements of £71.8m. During the year the Group paid £38.2m in 
relation to the 2008 final and the 2009 first interim dividends.
Financing and Bank c ovenants
The Group has in place a single credit agreement which comprises an amortising term loan facility, fully drawn in three 
currency tranches, and a non-amortising £500m multicurrency revolving credit facility. The rights issue proceeds were 
used to prepay the scheduled 2009 and 2010 term loan repayments, leaving term loan balances at 31 December 2009 
of £828m drawn in US dollar 630m, Euro 135m, and Sterling 316m. The term loan and revolving credit facilities mature 
in May 2012 and we expect there to be comfortable headroom on our facilities through to that date. 
 The principal financial covenant ratios under these facilities are maximum net debt to EBITDA of 3.5 times and 
minimum EBITDA interest cover of 4.0 times, tested semi-annually. At 31 December 2009 both financial covenants  
were comfortably achieved, with the ratio of net debt (using average exchange rates) to EBITDA reduced from 3.8  
times at 31 December 2008 to 2.7 times at 31 December 2009.
During May 2009 the Group successfully undertook a 2 for 5 rights issue offering 170m new ordinary shares at 150p  
per share. The rights issue raised £242m, net of expenses of £13m.
Balance s heet
Deferred income, which represents income received in advance, was down 2% on a constant currency basis at  
31 December 2009 compared to the same date in 2008. Deferred income arises primarily from advance subscriptions  
or forward bookings for trade shows, exhibitions or conferences. Subscriptions generated by our academic journal 
business renew annually a year in advance and many trade shows and exhibitions, because of their market leading  
status, receive commitments up to a year in advance. 
Pensions
The Group’s financial obligations to its pension schemes remain relatively small compared to the size of the Group, with 
net pension liabilities at 31 December 2009 of £11.3m (2008: £10.3m).
Following the completion of the triennial valuation of the main defined benefit scheme, the Informa Final Salary 
Scheme, a revised deficit funding plan has been agreed with the trustees to eliminate the deficit. The revised funding 
schedule extends over the next nine years, requiring the Group to pay into the pension fund an additional £1m in 2010, 
rising annually by £1m to an additional £4m per annum in 2013 through to 2018.
Revised deficit funding plans have also been agreed for the two smaller defined benefit schemes. The Group will  
pay additional pension contributions of £0.4m in 2010 rising to £0.9m per annum in 2013 through to 2018.

The Directors present their Annual Report on the affairs of 
Informa plc (the Company) and its subsidiaries (the Group), 
together with the financial statements and auditors’ 
report, for the year ended 31 December 2009. The details 
of the business, the development of the Group and its 
subsidiaries and likely future developments are set out 
in pages 2 to 18 of this document. The notice concerning 
forward looking statements is set out on page 133.
n ew h olding c ompany
On 30 June 2009, pursuant to a Scheme of Arrangement 
(the Scheme) under Part 26 of the Companies Act 2006, 
Informa plc (Informa), a public company limited by 
shares, incorporated in Jersey with number 102786 
and domiciled in Switzerland, became the new parent 
holding company of the Informa group. The Scheme was 
approved by the High Court of Justice of England and 
Wales and by shareholders at a general meeting of the 
Company held on 2 June 2009.
Informa was incorporated as Informa Limited under the 
Companies (Jersey) Law 1991 on 11 March 2009 and 
changed its name to Informa plc on 29 April 2009. 
Pursuant to the Scheme, ordinary shares in Informa were 
admitted to the UK Listing Authority’s Official List on 
30 June 2009 and trading on the London Stock Exchange’s 
market for listed securities commenced on 30 June 2009. 
The listing of the English registered Informa plc’s (Old 
Informa) ordinary shares on the UK Listing Authority’s 
Official List was cancelled on 30 June 2009. Under the 
terms of the Scheme, shareholders in Old Informa received 
one share in Informa for every share held in Old Informa. 
Upon the Scheme becoming effective, Old Informa 
changed its name to Informa Group plc and became a 
wholly-owned subsidiary of Informa.
Further information on the terms of the Scheme is set out 
in the Prospectus relating to the Scheme published by 
the Company on 1 May 2009, which can be viewed on the 
Company’s website at www.informa.com. Information on 
the Company’s share capital and the rights issue of Old 
Informa which was completed on 27 May 2009 can be found 
on page 28 and in Note 25 to the Consolidated Financial 
Statements. 
In order to give a view across the year, references  
in this section and in the Corporate Governance and 
Remuneration reports on pages 38 to 54, to Directors  
and the Board refer to those of Old Informa up to 
29 June 2009 and to those of Informa from 30 June 2009. 
Principal a ctivities
Informa is a leading international provider of specialist 
information and services for the academic and scientific, 
professional and commercial business communities. The 
subsidiary and associated undertakings principally affecting 
the profits or net assets of the Group in the year are listed in 
Note 18 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
Business Review
The Business Review is a review of the development 
and the operational and financial performance of the 
business during the year ended 31 December 2009 
and contains a description of the principal risks and 
uncertainties facing the business. Information that forms 
part of the Business Review is found in the following 
sections of the Annual Report:
information about the development and performance •	
of the business, and key performance indicators, of 
the Company during the financial year and future 
prospects are set out in the Chairman’s Statement  
and the Chief Executive’s Review on pages 14 to 18;
principal risks and uncertainties are described on •	
pages 31 to 36;
information about the Company’s Corporate •	
Responsibility policies, including environmental, 
employee, and social and community issues are  
set out in the Corporate Governance Statement  
on pages 43 to 44;
details of the principal subsidiaries are set out in •	
Note 18; and
the results for the year are explained in detail in •	
the Financial Review and are summarised in the 
Consolidated Income Statement on page 60 and the 
related Notes.
In relation to the use of financial instruments by the 
Group, a review is included within Note 24 to the 
Consolidated Financial Statements. There are no 
significant differences between the market value of 
any interests in land of the Group and the amount at 
which those interests are included in the Consolidated 
Statement of Financial Position.
As a whole the Annual Report provides information about 
the Group’s businesses, its financial performance during  
the year and likely future developments. 
DIRectoRs’ Re PoR t Informa plc Annual Report & Financial Statements for the year ended 31 December 2009 28
t he Year in Review
Other than as described in this report, there have not been 
any significant changes to the Group’s principal activities 
during the year under review and the Directors are not 
aware, at the date of this report, of any likely major changes 
in the Group’s activities in the new financial year. There have 
been no significant events since the reporting date.
Dividends
The Directors have declared that a second interim  
dividend for the year of 7.85p per ordinary share to be 
paid on 19 May 2010 to ordinary shareholders registered 
as at the close of business on 16 April 2010. Together 
with the first interim dividend of 3.6p per ordinary share 
paid on 18 September 2009, this makes a total for the 
year of 11.45p per ordinary share (2008: 10p). (The Group 
is paying a second interim dividend rather than a final 
dividend due to the operation of the Dividend Access 
Plan described below.) 
The Company operates a Dividend Access Plan for all 
its shareholders. Those shareholders who hold fewer 
than 100,000 shares are deemed to consent to receive 
their dividends from Informa DAP Limited, a UK Informa 
company. Those shareholders holding over 100,000 shares 
may elect to join the Dividend Access Plan by completing 
an Election Form. This form is available from the 
Company’s Registrars whose contact details can be found 
on page 134. If shareholders holding over 100,000 shares 
do not elect to join the Dividend Access Plan, dividends 
will be received from the Company which is domiciled 
in Switzerland. Shareholders may elect to receive shares 
instead of cash from their dividend allocation through the 
Dividend Reinvestment Plan (DRIP).
Directors and Directors’ Interests
The names of Directors of the Company are set out on 
pages 24 to 25, which includes brief biographical details. 
The Non-Executive Directors of Old Informa, being  
Derek Mapp, Dr Pamela Kirby, John Davis and Dr Brendan 
O’Neill, ceased to be Directors on 30 June 2009 when 
the Scheme became effective. Sean Watson resigned at 
the Annual General Meeting (AGM) of Old Informa on 
8 May 2009. There were no other changes to the Board  
of Old Informa prior to 30 June 2009.
Derek Mapp became a Director of Informa on 
12 March 2009 following the incorporation of the 
Company. Peter Rigby, Adam Walker, Dr Pamela Kirby, 
John Davis and Dr Brendan O’Neill became Directors  
of the Company on 27 April 2009.
The remuneration and interests in the share capital 
of the Company of the Directors who held office as 
at 31 December 2009 are set out in the Directors’ 
Remuneration Report on pages 45 to 54. All the Directors 
offer themselves for re-election by the shareholders at 
the next AGM. Details of the contracts of the Executive 
and Non-Executive Directors with the Company can 
be found on page 50. There are no agreements in 
place between the Company and its Directors and 
employees providing for compensation for loss of office 
of employment (whether through resignation, purported 
redundancy or otherwise) that occurs because of a 
takeover bid. No Director was materially interested in  
any contract of significance. 
Directors’ Indemnities
Indemnities are in force under which the Company 
has agreed to indemnify the Directors, to the extent 
permitted by Jersey law and the Company’s Articles of 
Association, in respect of any liability arising out of, or in 
connection with, the execution of their powers, duties 
and responsibilities, as Directors of the Company, any of 
its subsidiaries or as a trustee of an occupational pension 
scheme for employees of the Company. The Company 
has purchased and maintains Directors’ and Officers’ 
insurance cover against certain legal liabilities and costs 
for claims in connection with any act or omission by its 
Directors and officers in the execution of their duties.
Rights Issue and changes in s hare c apital
Old Informa raised £242m (net of expenses) by way of a 
2 for 5 fully underwritten rights issue at 150 pence per 
share on 27 May 2009. Immediately prior to the Scheme 
becoming effective on 30 June 2009, Old Informa had 
599,339,255 ordinary shares of 0.1 pence in issue. On the 
Scheme becoming effective, the issued share capital of 
Informa was 599,339,255 ordinary shares of 27 pence. 
Informa also carried out a reduction of its share capital 
by reducing the nominal value of each issued and 
authorised but unissued ordinary share in the capital 
of the Company from 27 pence to 0.1 pence, and the 
cancellation of the Company’s share premium account. 
The reductions in share capital and share premium 
account were approved by shareholders at a general 
meeting of the Company held on 2 June 2009. Both 
the reduction of share capital and cancellation of share 
premium account were confirmed by the Royal Court 
of Jersey on 20 July 2009 and registered with the Jersey 
Registrar of Companies on 22 July 2009.

share capital, together with movements in the issued 
share capital during the year, are shown in Note 25 of the 
Consolidated Financial Statements. 
The rights attaching to the Company’s ordinary shares, 
being the only share class of the Company, are set out in 
the Company’s Articles of Association (Articles), which 
can be found at www.informa.com. Subject to Jersey law, 
any share may be issued with or have attached to it such 
preferred, deferred or other special rights and restrictions 
as the Company may by special resolution decide or, if 
no such resolution is in effect or so far as the resolution 
does not make specific provision, as the Board may 
decide. No such resolution is currently in effect. Subject 
to the recommendation of the Board, holders of ordinary 
shares may receive a dividend. On liquidation, holders of 
ordinary shares may share in the assets of the Company. 
Holders of ordinary shares are also entitled to receive the 
Company’s Annual Report and Accounts and, subject to 
certain thresholds being met, may requisition the Board 
to convene a general meeting (GM) or the proposal of 
resolutions at AGMs. None of the ordinary shares carry 
any special rights with regard to control of the Company.
Holders of ordinary shares are entitled to attend and 
speak at GMs of the Company and to appoint one or 
more proxies or, if the holder of shares is a corporation, 
a corporate representative. On a show of hands, each 
holder of ordinary shares who (being an individual) is 
present in person or (being a corporation) is present by 
a duly appointed corporate representative, not being 
himself a member, shall have one vote and on a poll, 
every holder of ordinary shares present in person or by 
proxy shall have one vote for every share of which he is 
the holder. Electronic and paper proxy appointments 
and voting instructions must be received not later than 
48 hours before a GM. A holder of ordinary shares can 
lose the entitlement to vote at GMs where that holder 
has been served with a disclosure notice and has failed 
to provide the Company with information concerning 
interests held in those shares. Except as (1) set out above 
and (2) permitted under applicable statutes, there are 
no limitations on voting rights of holders of a given 
percentage, number of votes or deadlines for exercising 
voting rights. 
The Directors may refuse to register a transfer of a 
certificated share which is not fully paid, provided that 
the refusal does not prevent dealings in shares in the 
Company from taking place on an open and proper 
basis or where the Company has a lien over that share. 
Registration and Domicile
The Company’s registered office is at 22 Grenville Street, 
St Helier, Jersey, JE4 8PX. The Company is registered in 
Jersey under number 102786. The Company is domiciled 
in Switzerland with its principal office at Gubelstrasse 11, 
CH-6300, Zug.
a nnual g eneral meeting
The AGM will be held on 27 April 2010. The notice 
is being despatched as a separate document.
charitable and Political c ontributions
The Group made charitable donations during the year of 
£0.2m (2008: £0.2m), principally to local charities serving 
some of the communities in which the Group operates. 
No political donations were made.
s upplier Payment Policy
The Company’s policy, which is also applied by the 
Group, is to settle terms of payment with suppliers when 
agreeing the terms of each transaction, to ensure that 
suppliers are aware of the terms of payment and to 
abide by the agreed terms, provided that the supplier 
has provided the goods or services in accordance with 
the relevant terms and conditions. Trade payables of the 
Group at 31 December 2009 were equivalent to 52 days’ 
purchases (2008: 46 days), based on the average daily 
amount invoiced by suppliers during the year.
s ubstantial s hareholdings 
As at 2 March 2010, the Company had been notified 
in accordance with Chapter 5 of the Disclosure and 
Transparency Rules (DTRs) of the FSA of the following 
substantial interests in the issued ordinary share capital 
of the Company:
Number

FMR LLC (Fidelity) 55,380,804 9.24

Legal & General Group plc 35,939,012 5.99
Standard Life Investments 
Limited 20,561,397 3.43
As at 2 March 2010, the Company’s issued share capital 
comprised 599,250,457 ordinary shares with a nominal 
value of 0.1p each. Details of the authorised and issued  Informa plc Annual Report & Financial Statements for the year ended 31 December 2009 30
t he Year in Review
The Directors may also refuse to register a transfer of a 
certificated share unless the instrument of transfer is: (i) 
lodged, duly stamped (if necessary), at the registered 
office of the Company or any other place as the Board 
may decide accompanied by the certificate for the 
share(s) to be transferred and/or such other evidence as 
the Directors may reasonably require to show the right 
of the transferor to make the transfer; or (ii) in respect of 
only one class of shares. 
Transfers of uncertificated shares must be carried out 
using CREST and the Directors can refuse to register a 
transfer of an uncertificated share in accordance with the 
regulations governing the operation of CREST.
The Directors may decide to suspend the registration 
of transfers, for up to 30 days a year, by closing the 
register of shareholders. The Directors cannot suspend 
the registration of transfers of any uncertificated shares 
without obtaining consent from CREST. 
There are no other restrictions on the transfer of ordinary 
shares in the Company except: (1) certain restrictions may 
from time to time be imposed by laws and regulations 
(for example insider trading laws); (2) pursuant to the 
Company’s share dealing code whereby the Directors and 
certain employees of the Company require approval to 
deal in the Company’s shares; and (3) where a shareholder 
with at least a 0.25% interest in the Company’s certificated 
shares has been served with a disclosure notice and 
has failed to provide the Company with information 
concerning interests in those shares. There are no 
agreements between holders of ordinary shares that are 
known to the Company which may result in restrictions on 
the transfer of securities or on voting rights. 
Shares are from time to time held by a trustee in order 
to satisfy entitlements of employees to shares under the 
Group’s share schemes. Usually the shares held on trust 
are no more than sufficient to satisfy the requirements 
of the Group’s share schemes for one year. The shares 
held by these trusts do not have any special rights with 
regard to control of the Company. While these shares 
are held on trust their rights are not exercisable directly 
by the relevant employees. The current arrangements 
concerning these trusts and their shareholdings are set 
out on page 52. 
There are no significant agreements to which the 
Company is a party that take effect, alter or terminate 
upon a change of control following a takeover bid (nor 
any agreements between the Company and its Directors 
or employees providing for compensation for loss of 
office or employment that occurs because of a takeover 
bid) except for the Group’s banking facilities described in 
Note 24 of the Consolidated Financial Statements. 
The rules for appointment and replacement of the Directors 
are set out in the Articles. Directors can be appointed by the 
Company by ordinary resolution at a GM or by the Board 
upon the recommendation of the Nomination Committee. 
The Company can remove a director from office, including 
by passing an ordinary resolution or by notice being given 
by all the other Directors. 
The powers of the Directors are set out in the Articles and 
provide that the Board may exercise all the powers of the 
Company including to borrow money up to an aggregate 
of three times a formula based on adjusted capital and 
reserves. The Company may by ordinary resolution 
authorise the Board to issue shares, and increase, 
consolidate, sub-divide and cancel shares in accordance 
with its Articles and Jersey law.
The Company may amend its Articles by special 
resolution approved at a GM.
Purchase of o wn s hares
At the end of the year, the Directors had authority, 
under a shareholders’ resolution passed on 27 April 2009 
conditionally upon the Scheme becoming effective, to 
purchase through the market up to 10% of the Company’s 
issued ordinary shares as at 30 June 2009. This authority 
expires at the conclusion of the AGM of the Company to be 
held in 2010.
employee c onsultation
The Group places considerable value on the involvement 
of its employees and continues to keep them informed 
on matters affecting them and on the various factors 
affecting the performance of the Group. This is achieved 
principally through formal and informal meetings, email 
updates and via the Company’s global intranet site, 
which enables staff to put anonymous questions to the 
Executive management. Employee representatives are 
consulted regularly on a wide range of matters affecting 
their current and future interests.
In 2009 the Group decided to develop a more thorough 
and focused staff survey, moving away from the 2008 
survey which had a broader focus on the brand. A 
pilot staff survey was carried out by Taylor and Francis, 
globally. It aimed to identify the major drivers of 
DIRectoRs’ Re PoR t continued 31 Informa plc Annual Report & Financial Statements for the year ended 31 December 2009
employee engagement, and improve understanding of 
the reasons behind voluntary turnover of staff.
All employees worldwide are also invited periodically to 
attend webinars, take part in live on-line polls, and ask 
the Executive Directors questions about the business 
and its future. The webinars, including the results of the 
polls, are posted on the Company’s intranet so that those 
employees who are unable to attend can view them.
At a general meeting of the Company held on 2 June 2009, a 
new Share Incentive Plan (SIP) was approved by shareholders 
for its adoption pursuant to the Scheme becoming effective 
on 30 June 2009. It is substantially in the same form as the 
one in place for Old Informa. All UK employees are eligible 
to participate in the SIP , an Inland Revenue Approved All 
Employee Share Incentive Plan offering UK employees the 
opportunity to purchase annually up to £1,500 of shares in 
the Company out of pre-tax salary. In addition, from 2008, all 
US employees are eligible to participate in the Company’s US 
Employee Stock Purchase Plan which offers US employees the 
opportunity to purchase annually up to $2,940 of shares in the 
Company at a 15% discount to the prevailing market price.
equal o pportunities
Informa believes in equality of opportunity for all 
employees based on merit and that no employee or job 
applicant should receive less favourable treatment on 
the grounds of age, gender, sexual orientation, disability, 
colour, race, religion, nationality or ethnicity. Informa’s 
divisions are all disabled friendly business operations. 
The Company’s equal opportunity policy not only covers 
fair recruitment, but also the opportunities given to staff on 
training and development, and the Group’s views on equal 
opportunities form a part of the employee induction training. 
The Group’s objective is to provide continued suitable 
employment to staff whose circumstances change, with 
appropriate training if necessary. Informa’s offices are 
required to enable access for all abilities and comply with 
all applicable local laws. 
A review of the existing equal opportunities policy 
is being carried out during 2010 to produce a 
comprehensive diversity policy.
Risks and u ncertainties 
A number of factors (risk factors) affect the Group’s 
operating results and financial condition. In common 
with other information providers, the Group’s profitability 
depends in part on the prevailing economic environment 
and the strength of the academic, professional and 
business communities to which it sells. In addition, 
the Group’s profitability is dependent on maintaining 
a strong and highly motivated management team, 
maintaining brand reputation, quality of information and 
its ability to use and protect the security of its marketing 
databases. This section describes some of the principal 
risk factors that the Directors believe could materially 
affect the Group. The Group adopts a risk management 
process that is monitored by the Board and which is 
intended to ensure a consistent and coherent approach 
to the risk factors that are described in this section and 
to those other risk factors that may arise or which may 
become material in the future.
1.  The Group’s businesses are affected by the 
conditions of the sectors and regions in which  
they and their customers operate
The performance of the Group depends on the 
financial health and strength of its customers, which 
in turn is dependent on the economic conditions in 
the industries and geographic regions in which they 
operate. Traditionally, spending on parts of the Group’s 
goods and services (products) has been cyclical due 
to companies spending significantly less in times 
of economic slowdown (such as those prevailing 
at present), downward pressure on budgets and 
corporate consolidation in certain sectors (e.g. financial 
services). The current global economic conditions also 
mean that certain customers might become insolvent 
which may in turn lead them to default on payment for 
products already purchased. Unforeseen disruptions, 
whether caused by natural causes or otherwise, 
can also be detrimental to the Group’s businesses, 
particularly events and training. 
2. The markets in which the Group operates are highly 
competitive and subject to rapid change
The markets for the Group’s products are highly 
competitive and in a state of ongoing and 
uncertain change. Some of the Group’s principal 
competitors have substantial financial resources, 
recognised brands, technological expertise and 
market experience that may better position them to 
anticipate and respond to these changes. If the Group 
is unable to successfully enhance and/or develop 
its products in a timely fashion, the Group’s revenue 
could be affected. There are also low barriers to entry 
in relation to certain parts of the Group’s businesses.  Informa plc Annual Report & Financial Statements for the year ended 31 December 2009 32
t he Year in Review
3. The Group’s intellectual property (IP) rights may not 
be adequately protected and may be challenged by 
third parties
The Group relies on agreements with its customers 
and trademark, copyright and other IP laws to 
establish and protect the IP rights subsisting in its 
journals, books and training materials. However, 
these rights may be challenged, limited, invalidated 
or circumvented by third parties seeking to infringe 
or otherwise profit from the Group’s proprietary 
rights without its authorisation. In addition, 
although there is now a small amount of copyright 
legislation relating to digital content, these laws 
remain under legal review and there remains 
significant uncertainty as to the form copyright law 
may ultimately take. Additionally, enforcement of 
IP rights is limited in certain jurisdictions, and the 
global nature of the internet makes it impossible 
to control the ultimate destination of websites. 
The Group may also be the subject of claims of 
infringement of the rights of others or party to 
claims to determine the scope and validity of the IP 
rights of others. Litigation based on these claims is 
common amongst companies that utilise digital IP . 
4. The Group’s Academic division’s publications and 
events are likely to be adversely affected by changes 
in the purchasing behaviour of academic institutions
Academic institutions fund purchases of Group 
products from limited budgets that may be sensitive 
to changes in private (including endowments) and 
governmental sources of funding particularly in the 
current global economic conditions. Accordingly, 
any such decreases are likely to affect adversely the 
Group’s results within its Academic division.
5. Currency fluctuations may have a significant impact 
on the reported revenue and profit of the Group
The financial statements of the Group are expressed 
in pounds sterling but its business operations 
receive revenue and incur expense in other 
currencies in particular, US Dollars and Euros. The 
relative movements between the exchange rates 
in the currencies in which costs are incurred and 
the currencies in which revenue is earned can 
significantly affect the results of those businesses. 
6. The Group has exposure to various risks from its use 
of financial instruments
These risks include capital risk, market risk, credit risk 
and liquidity risk. These risks are described in detail in 
Note 24 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 
7. The Group may be adversely affected by its borrowings 
and debt service obligations in the longer-term
The Group has in place a single credit agreement 
which comprises an amortising term loan facility, 
fully drawn in three currency tranches, and a non-
amortising £500m multicurrency revolving credit 
facility. The 2009 rights issue proceeds were used 
to prepay the scheduled 2009 and 2010 term loan 
repayments, leaving term loan balances at  
31 December 2009 of £828m drawn in US dollar 
630m, Euro 135m and Sterling 316m. 
The Group’s debt service obligations under its credit 
facilities could have negative consequences for the 
Group, including the following: restricting the Group’s 
ability to pay dividends; limiting the Group’s ability 
to obtain additional financing in the longer-term; 
increasing the Group’s vulnerability to increases in 
interest rates; requiring a substantial portion of the 
Group’s cash flow for the payment of interest on its 
debt and reducing the Group’s ability to use its cash 
flow to fund working capital, capital expenditures 
and general corporate requirements; hindering the 
Group’s ability to adjust rapidly, and increasing the 
Group’s vulnerability to general adverse economic 
and industry conditions; limiting the Group’s 
flexibility in planning for, or responding to, changes in 
its business; and placing the Group at a competitive 
disadvantage to other, less leveraged competitors. 
There can be no assurance that in the event of 
unforeseen changes over the longer-term, the Group’s 
cash flow will be sufficient for repayment of the Group’s 
indebtedness nor that the current difficult conditions 
in the credit markets will not exist if the Group seeks 
to refinance its credit facilities in the longer-term, 
either prior to or at maturity in May 2012.
8. If the financial performance of the Group declines 
it may in the longer-term not be able to maintain 
compliance with the covenants in its credit facilities
The Group’s credit facilities contain covenants and 
undertakings with which the Group must comply, 
including a maximum net debt to Earnings Before 
DIRectoRs’ Re PoR t continued 33 Informa plc Annual Report & Financial Statements for the year ended 31 December 2009
Interest, Taxes, Depreciation and Amortisation 
(EBITDA) covenant and minimum EBITDA  
interest cover covenant, each of which is tested 
semi-annually. If the Group were to fail to comply 
with any of the financial covenants in its credit 
facilities (e.g. due to a reduction in its revenue 
arising from continued deterioration of economic 
conditions or other factors outside the Group’s 
control), it could result in acceleration of the 
Group’s obligations to repay those borrowings or 
cancellation of those facilities. In the event that 
the Group anticipates such a breach or otherwise 
believes it had insufficient headroom for its 
operations, the Group may be required to sell assets 
at depressed prices.
9. The Group’s continued growth depends, in part, 
on its successful ability to identify and complete 
acquisitions and the Group may have difficulty in the 
longer-term in procuring additional debt financing 
for such acquisitions
Although the Group has historically been able to 
obtain debt financing for its acquisitions on terms it 
considers acceptable, it is highly unlikely, particularly 
in the near-term, that future debt financing will be 
available on such terms due to significant market 
deterioration in the credit markets and a tightening of 
lender standards and terms. Additionally, covenants in 
the Group’s existing and future financing facilities may 
restrict the Group’s ability to undertake acquisitions. 
Furthermore, attractive acquisitions are difficult 
to identify and complete for a number of reasons, 
including competition among prospective buyers. 
In addition, any acquisition the Group may complete 
may be made at a substantial premium, and there 
can be no assurances that the Group will achieve the 
expected return on its investment, particularly as the 
success of any acquisition also depends in part on the 
Group’s ability to integrate the acquired business or 
assets. This process may involve unforeseen difficulties 
and integration could take longer than anticipated 
as well as requiring a disproportionate amount of 
management’s attention and financial resources. 
Further, the Group may not be able to maintain 
or improve the historical financial performance of 
acquired businesses or otherwise derive all of the 
anticipated benefits from its acquisitions, such as 
reduced operating costs due to centralised services.
10. The Group relies on the experience and talent of its 
senior management and on its ability to recruit and 
retain key employees for the success of its business
The successful management and operations of the 
Group are reliant upon the contributions of its senior 
management and other key personnel. In addition, 
the Group’s future success depends in part on its 
ability to continue to recruit, motivate and retain 
highly experienced and qualified employees in the 
face of intense competition from other companies. 
Additionally, many of the Group’s key employees 
are employed by the Group under profit-sharing 
arrangements with respect to the businesses they 
operate, and in times of declining profit there can be 
no assurances that the Group will be able to retain 
such senior management or other key personnel (or 
indeed that the Group will be able to attract new 
personnel to support the growth of its business).
11 The Group may be subject to impairment losses that 
would reduce its reported assets and profit
Goodwill and intangible assets comprise a substantial 
portion of the total assets of the Group and economic, 
legal, regulatory, competitive, contractual and other 
factors may impair the value of these assets. In such a 
situation, accounting rules would require that the Group 
reduce their carrying value and recognise an impairment 
charge, which would reduce the Group’s reported assets 
and earnings in the year as the impairment charge is 
recognised. The assumptions used in the estimation of 
value in use are, by their very nature, highly judgmental 
and the Group could be required to recognise significant 
impairment charges in the future.
12 Changes in tax laws or their application or 
interpretation may adversely impact the Group
The Group operates in a large number of countries 
and thus its earnings are subject to tax in many 
jurisdictions. Relevant authorities may amend the 
substance or interpretation of tax laws that apply to 
the Group’s businesses, in a manner that is adverse 
to the Group. There can therefore be no assurance 
that the various levels of taxation to which the 
Group is subject will not be increased or changed. In 
addition, if any Group company is found to be, or to 
have been, tax resident in any jurisdiction other than 
those in which the Group is currently deemed to be 
tax resident or to have a permanent establishment in 
any such jurisdiction this may have a material adverse 
effect on the amount of tax payable by the Group.  Informa plc Annual Report & Financial Statements for the year ended 31 December 2009 34
t he Year in Review
Given that the Company has moved its domicile to 
Switzerland, the risk may be more pronounced. 
13. Risks associated with doing business internationally 
and the expansion into new geographic regions 
presents new risk factors specific to these regions
The Group’s businesses could be adversely affected 
by a variety of other international factors, including 
changes in a specific country’s or regions political 
and cultural climate or economic condition and 
changes to, or variances among, foreign laws 
(including laws relating to Intellectual Property 
rights and contract enforcement) and regulatory 
requirements. The Group’s expansion into various 
geographic regions, also presents logistical and 
management challenges related to business 
cultures, language compliance and restrictions on 
repatriation of earnings. The Group may face risks 
in penetrating new geographic markets due to 
established and entrenched competitors, difficulties 
in developing products that are tailored to the 
needs of local customers, lack of local acceptance 
or knowledge of the Group’s products, lack of 
recognition of its brands, and the unavailability of 
local companies for acquisition.
14 The Group’s businesses and strategy are dependent 
on the strength of the Group’s brands
The Group’s businesses are dependent on the 
success of their brands. The Group’s success and 
ability to compete is dependent, in part, upon 
the Group’s ability to maintain and protect the 
proprietary nature of these brands and thus to 
prevent the Group’s competitors and others from 
producing branded publications, events and training 
courses based on the Group’s brands.
15. Increased accessibility to free or relatively 
inexpensive information sources may reduce 
demand for the Group’s products
In recent years, more public sources of free or 
relatively inexpensive information have become 
available, particularly through the internet, and 
this trend is expected to continue. For example, 
some governmental and regulatory agencies have 
increased the amount of information they make 
publicly available at no cost. Such sources may 
reduce demand for the Group’s products.
16. The Group is dependent on the internet and 
its electronic delivery platforms, networks and 
distribution systems
The Group’s businesses are increasingly dependent 
on electronic platforms and distribution systems, 
primarily the internet, for delivery of their products. 
Any significant failure or interruption of these 
systems, including sabotage, break-ins, terrorist 
activities, natural disaster, service outages and 
computer viruses could cause the Group’s systems to 
operate slowly and thus offset the Group’s ability to 
provide services to customers. 
17. Breaches of the Group’s data security systems or other 
unauthorised access to its databases could adversely 
affect the Group’s businesses and operations
The Group has valuable databases and as part of its 
businesses provides its customers with access to 
database information. There are persons who may 
try to breach the Group’s data security systems or 
gain other unauthorised access to its databases 
in order to misappropriate such information for 
potentially fraudulent purposes. Because the 
techniques used by such persons change frequently, 
the Group may be unable to anticipate or protect 
against the threat of breaches of data security or 
other unauthorised access. This could damage the 
Group’s reputation and expose it to a risk of loss or 
litigation and possible liability, as well as increase 
the likelihood of more extensive governmental 
regulation of these activities in a way that could 
adversely affect this aspect of the Group’s business.
18.  The Group is subject to regulation regarding the use 
of personal customer data
The Group is increasingly required to comply 
with strict data protection and privacy legislation 
which restrict the Group’s ability to collect and use 
personal information. The need to comply with 
data protection legislation can affect the Group in 
a number of material ways including, e.g. making 
it more difficult to grow and maintain marketing 
data and also through potential litigation relating 
to the alleged misuse of personal data. In some 
cases, the Group may rely on third party contractors 
and employees to maintain its databases and seeks 
to ensure that procedures are in place to comply 
with the relevant data protection regulations. The 
Group is exposed to the risk that its data could 
DIRectoRs’ Re PoR t continued 35 Informa plc Annual Report & Financial Statements for the year ended 31 December 2009
be wrongfully appropriated, lost or disclosed, or 
processed in breach of data protection regulation, 
by or on behalf of the Group in which case, the 
Group could face liability under data protection 
laws and/or suffer reputational damage from the 
resulting loss of the goodwill. 
19. The Group’s training business derives revenue from 
government spending
A large proportion of the revenue from the Group’s 
training businesses is derived from US federal and 
state government agencies. Government spending, 
both in the United States and elsewhere, may be 
influenced by, among other things, the state of the 
economy, competing priorities for appropriation, 
political factors, changes in administration or control 
of local governments and the timing and amount 
of tax receipts and the overall level of government 
expenditures. There can be no assurances that 
United States federal and state departments will 
continue to purchase the products of the Group’s 
training business to the extent they have done 
so historically or at all or the implementation of 
contracts with government agencies may be  
delayed or cancelled.
20.  The Group may be adversely affected by enforcement 
of and changes in legislation and regulation affecting 
its businesses and that of its customers
Compliance with various laws and regulations may 
impose significant compliance costs and restrictions 
on the Group or alternatively fines for non-compliance. 
In addition, such regulations often provide broad 
discretion to the administering authorities and 
changes in existing laws or regulations, or in their 
interpretation or enforcement, could require the Group 
to incur additional costs in complying with those 
laws, or require changes to its strategy, operations 
or accounting and reporting systems. In particular, 
laws and regulations relating to communications, 
data protection, e-commerce, direct marketing and 
digital advertising have become more prevalent 
in recent years. Existing and proposed legislation 
and regulations may impose limits on the Group’s 
collection and use of certain kinds of information 
and its ability to communicate such information 
effectively to its customers. Similarly, the Group’s 
customers are required to comply with various laws, 
regulations, administrative actions and policies that 
are subject to change. For example, the Group relies 
on the pharmaceutical industry for a proportion 
of its publishing subscription revenue. Changes in 
government health policies and regulatory pressures 
may affect pharmaceutical companies’ ability or desire 
to continue to provide the same levels of spending 
with the Group as they do currently.
21. The Group may operate in an increasingly  
litigious environment, which may adversely affect  
its financial results
The Group may become involved in legal actions and 
claims arising in the ordinary course of business. Due 
to the inherent uncertainty in the litigation process, 
the resolution of any particular legal proceeding could 
have a material adverse effect on the financial position 
and results of operations of the Group. The Group is 
significantly dependent on technology and the rights 
related to it, including rights in respect of business 
methods. This, combined with the recent proliferation of 
“business-method patents” issued by the United States 
Patent Office, and the increasingly litigious environment 
that surrounds patents in general, increases the possibility 
that the Group could be sued for patent infringement. If 
such an infringement suit were successful, it is possible 
that the infringing product would be enjoined by court 
order and removed from the market and the Group 
could be required to compensate the party bringing 
the suit either by a damages claim or through ongoing 
licence fees or other fees, and such compensation could 
be significant, in addition to the legal fees that would be 
incurred defending such a claim.
22. The Group’s UK defined benefit pension schemes are 
currently in deficit and the cost of providing pension 
benefits to existing and former employees is subject to 
changes in pension fund values and changing mortality
The Group operates a number of defined benefit and 
defined contribution pension schemes in the UK and 
overseas. Although it currently is the Group’s policy to 
offer defined contribution pension schemes to its new 
employees, the Group has historically maintained 
defined benefit schemes in the UK pursuant to 
which the Group may be required to increase its 
contributions to cover an increase in the cost of 
funding future pension benefits or to cover funding 
shortfalls under the Group’s pension schemes. The 
funding position of the Group’s defined benefit 
schemes has fluctuated and is likely to fluctuate 
as a result of changes in economic conditions, 
demographic experience, movements in interest 
rates, the investment performance of the schemes’ 
assets and the longevity of the schemes’ members.  Informa plc Annual Report & Financial Statements for the year ended 31 December 2009 36
t he Year in Review
23. The structure of the Group following the 
implementation of its Scheme of arrangement in 
2009 may not yield the anticipated benefits
The Scheme was implemented to establish a corporate 
structure which the Board considers would best 
support the long-term growth of the Group; however 
there can be no guarantee that the implementation 
of the Scheme will yield all or any of the anticipated 
benefits. In particular, the selection of Jersey as the 
jurisdiction of incorporation, and Switzerland as the 
jurisdiction of tax residence, of the company may 
not ultimately facilitate the centralisation of certain 
Group activities or the optimisation of the Group’s legal 
and taxation structure, as these jurisdictions may not 
offer the stable political and economic environment 
or the less complex taxation system which are 
currently anticipated. Additionally, Swiss or Jersey tax 
authorities may amend, interpret or apply tax laws in 
a manner that is adverse to the Group.
The Group effected an intra-group reorganisation in 
connection with the scheme. There can be no guarantee 
that a tax authority would not form a different opinion 
or judgement on the tax treatment of the reorganisation 
that differs from the position of the Group. In the event 
that a differing view of a tax authority is subsequently 
determined to be correct, this could have a detrimental 
impact on the Group’s tax position and such detrimental 
impact could be material.
24.  Dividends paid under the Dividend Access Plan may 
become subject to Swiss withholding tax at 35 per cent
Under current Swiss law withholding tax is payable 
upon the Company’s payment of dividends (including 
dividends paid under the Dividend Access Plan) in the 
event that, and to the extent that, the total value of 
dividends and other distributions paid by New Informa 
exceeds the value of the Company immediately prior to 
the scheme becoming effective. A potential charge 
to withholding tax at 35 per cent. on dividends and 
other distributions may arise upon such payments.
Further details in relation to certain of these risk factors, 
and other risks relating to (1) the scheme of arrangement, 
(2) the holding of Company’s ordinary shares and (3) 
relating to US shareholders are set out on pages 11 to 22 
of the prospectus issued by the Company on 1 May 2009.

statement of Directors’ Responsibilities
The Directors are responsible for preparing the  
financial statements in accordance with applicable  
law and regulations.
Company law requires the Directors to prepare financial 
statements for each financial year. 
Under that law the Directors have elected to prepare the 
financial statements in accordance with International 
Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the 
European Union. The financial statements are required 
by law to be properly prepared in accordance with the 
Companies (Jersey) Law 1991. 
International Accounting Standard 1 requires that financial 
statements present fairly for each financial year the 
Company’s financial position, financial performance and 
cash flows. This requires the faithful representation of the 
effects of transactions, other events and conditions in 
accordance with the definitions and recognition criteria 
for assets, liabilities, income and expenses set out in the 
International Accounting Standards Board’s ‘Framework for 
the preparation and presentation of financial statements’ . 
In virtually all circumstances, a fair presentation will 
be achieved by compliance with all applicable IFRSs. 
However, the Directors are also required to:
properly select and apply accounting policies; •	
present information, including accounting policies, •	
in a manner that provides relevant, reliable, 
comparable and understandable information; 
DIRectoRs’ Re PoR t continued 37 Informa plc Annual Report & Financial Statements for the year ended 31 December 2009
provide additional disclosures when compliance •	
with the specific requirements in IFRSs are 
insufficient to enable users to understand the 
impact of particular transactions, other events and 
conditions on the entity’s financial position and 
financial performance; and
make an assessment of the Company’s ability to •	
continue as a going concern.
The Directors are responsible for keeping proper 
accounting records that disclose with reasonable accuracy 
at any time the financial position of the company and 
enable them to ensure that the financial statements 
comply with the Companies (Jersey) Law 1991. They 
are also responsible for safeguarding the assets of the 
company and hence for taking reasonable steps for the 
prevention and detection of fraud and other irregularities.
The Directors are responsible for the maintenance and 
integrity of the corporate and financial information included 
on the Company’s website. Legislation in the UK governing 
the preparation and dissemination of financial statements 
may differ from legislation in other jurisdictions.
In accordance with DTR 4.1.12, the Directors confirm that, 
to the best of their knowledge:
the financial statements have been prepared in •	
accordance with the applicable set of accounting 
standards and give a true and fair view of the assets, 
liabilities, financial position and profit or loss of the 
Company and the undertakings included in the 
consolidation taken as a whole; and
the year end review includes a fair review of the •	
development and performance of the business and 
the position of the Company and the undertakings 
included in the consolidation taken as a whole, 
together with a description of the principal risks and 
uncertainties that they face.

t he Year in Review
The Company is committed to the principles of corporate 
governance contained in the Combined Code on 
Corporate Governance (the Code) that was issued in 2008 
by the Financial Reporting Council for which the Board is 
accountable to shareholders. Throughout the year ended 
31 December 2009 the Company was in compliance with 
all the Code provisions set out in Section 1 of the Code. 
Together this report and the Directors’ Remuneration 
Report explain how the Company has applied the 
principles and supporting principles of Good Governance 
set out in Section 1 of the Code.
On 30 June 2009, Informa plc (Informa), a public 
company limited by shares, incorporated in Jersey with 
number 102786 and domiciled in Switzerland became 
the new parent company for the Informa Group of 
companies, pursuant to a scheme of arrangement under 
Part 26 of the Companies Act 2006. As a company listed 
on the London Stock Exchange, Informa is subject to 
the Listing Rules of the Financial Services Authority and 
voluntarily complies with the provisions of the Combined 
Code and relevant institutional shareholder guidelines.
Although Informa is not subject to the UK Companies 
Act, the Board considers it appropriate to provide 
shareholder safeguards which are similar to those that 
apply to a UK registered company and are consistent with 
the relevant provisions of the UK Companies Act.
The Board members of Informa are noted in the Directors’ 
Report on page 28.
t he Board
The Informa Group of companies (the Group) is 
controlled through its Board of Directors. The Board’s 
main roles are to create value for shareholders, to provide 
leadership of the Group, to approve the Group’s strategic 
objectives and to ensure that the necessary financial 
and other resources are made available to enable those 
objectives to be met.
An updated schedule which sets out the matters reserved 
for the Board’s approval, which is reviewed and updated 
annually, was adopted by the Board on 24 June 2009 prior 
to the Scheme becoming effective on 30 June 2009. The 
specific responsibilities reserved for the Board include: 
approving the Group’s long-term objectives and •	
commercial strategy; 
approving the Group’s annual operating and capital •	
expenditure budgets; 
reviewing operational and financial performance; •	
approving major acquisitions, disposals and capital •	
projects; 
reviewing the Group’s systems of internal control •	
and risk management; 
reviewing the environmental, health and safety •	
policies of the Group; 
approving appointments to, and removals from, the •	
Board and of the Company Secretary; 
approving policies relating to Directors’ •	
remuneration; and
reviewing the dividend policy and determining the •	
amounts of dividends.
The Board has delegated the following activities to the 
Executive Directors: 
the development and recommendation of strategic •	
plans for consideration by the Board that reflect the 
longer-term objectives and priorities established by 
the Board;
implementation of the strategies and policies of the •	
Group as determined by the Board; 
monitoring of the operating and financial results •	
against plans and budgets; 
monitoring the performance of acquisitions and •	
investments against plans and objectives; 
prioritising the allocation of capital, technical and •	
human resources; and 
developing and implementing risk management •	
systems.

Derek Mapp was appointed as Non-Executive Chairman 
on 17 March 2008. As Chairman, he leads the Board 
and is responsible for setting its agenda and ensuring 
its effectiveness. He is also responsible for ensuring 
that Directors receive accurate, timely and clear 
information and for effective communication with 
shareholders. He facilitates the effective contribution 
of Non-Executive Directors and constructive relations 
between the Executive and Non-Executive Directors. 
He also acts on the results of the Board performance 
evaluation by recognising the strengths and addressing 
the weaknesses of the Board, and, where appropriate, 
proposes new members be appointed to the Board or 
seeking the resignation of Directors.
Peter Rigby was re-appointed as Chief Executive on  
17 March 2008 and has the responsibility of running  
the Company. As Chief Executive, he has direct charge 
of the Group on a day-to-day basis and is accountable to 
the Board for its operational and financial performance. 
He is also primarily responsible for implementation 
of the Company’s strategy including ensuring the 
achievement of the Group’s budgets and optimising the 
Group’s resources. He also has primary responsibility 
for managing the Group’s risk profile, identifying 
and executing new business opportunities and for 
management development and remuneration.
Dr Pamela Kirby was appointed as Senior Independent 
Director on 17 March 2008 and is available to meet 
shareholders on request and to ensure that the Board is 
aware of any shareholder concerns not resolved through 
existing mechanisms for investor communication.
Directors and Directors’ Independence
As at 31 December 2009 the Board comprised four 
independent Non-Executive Directors, one of whom is 
the Chairman, and two Executive Directors all of whom 
have served throughout the 2009 financial year. In 
addition, from 1 January to 8 May 2009 it included  
Sean Watson as a fifth Non-Executive Director.
The Board includes independent Non-Executive 
Directors who constructively challenge and help develop 
proposals on strategy and bring strong, independent 
judgement, knowledge and experience to the Board’s 
deliberations. The independent Directors are of sufficient 
calibre and number that their views carry significant 
weight in the Board’s decision-making process. The 
Board considers all of its Non-Executive Directors to be 
independent in character and judgement.
There is an agreed procedure in place for the Directors to 
obtain independent professional advice, at the Group’s 
expense, should they consider it necessary to do so in 
order to carry out their responsibilities. The Directors’ 
contracts are available for inspection at the registered 
office during normal business hours and will be available 
for inspection at the AGM.
Professional Development
On appointment the Directors receive relevant 
information about the Group, the role of the Board and the 
matters reserved for its decision, the terms of reference 
and membership of the principal Board Committees and 
the powers delegated to those Committees, the Group’s 
corporate governance policies and procedures and 
the latest financial information about the Group. This is 
supplemented by visits to key locations and meetings with 
key senior executives. On appointment the Directors are 
also advised of their legal and other duties and obligations 
as a Director of a listed company.
Throughout their period in office, the Directors are 
continually updated on the Group’s business and the 
environment in which it operates, by written briefings and 
by meetings with senior executives, who are invited to 
attend and present at Board meetings from time to time. 
They are also updated on any changes to the legal and 
governance requirements of the Group and those which 
affect themselves as Directors and are able to obtain training, 
at the Group’s expense, to ensure they are kept up-to-date  
on relevant new legislation and changing commercial risks.
Performance evaluation
The Board utilises a formal and rigorous process, led by the 
Chairman, for the annual evaluation of the performance 
of the Board, its principal committees and individual 
Directors. On appointment the Directors are made aware 
that their performance will be subject to evaluation.
For 2009 the evaluation was performed by the Chairman 
who conducted a series of focused interviews with each 
member of the Board in his or her capacity as a Director and, 
where applicable, as a member or Chairman of a principal 
committee. The findings and recommendations of the 
review were presented to the Board as a whole, with a view 
to implementing any recommendations made to improve 
the overall effectiveness of the Board during 2010. The 
Non-Executive Directors, led by the Senior Independent 
Director, also met without the Chairman present to conduct 
an evaluation of the Chairman’s performance. Informa plc Annual Report & Financial Statements for the year ended 31 December 2009 40
t he Year in Review
Re-election
All of the Company’s Directors are subject to annual re-
election at the 2010 AGM. The Board is satisfied, following 
formal evaluation, that each Director continues to be 
effective and to demonstrate commitment to his/her role.
t he c ompany s ecretary
The Company Secretary is responsible for advising the 
Board through the Chairman on all governance matters 
and all Directors have access to the advice and services of 
the Company Secretary.
Information
Regular reports and papers are circulated to the Directors 
in a timely manner in preparation for Board and Committee 
meetings. These papers are supplemented by any 
information specifically requested by the Directors from 
time to time. The Non-Executive Directors receive monthly 
management reports from the Chief Executive and the 
Finance Director which enable them to scrutinise the Group’s 
and management’s performance against agreed objectives.
Relations with s hareholders
The Company is committed to maintaining good 
communications with investors. Each of Derek Mapp as 
Chairman and Dr Pamela Kirby as Senior Independent 
Director provides the Board with feedback on any issues 
raised with them by shareholders. 
The Executive Directors have frequent discussions with 
institutional shareholders on a range of issues affecting 
the Group’s performance. These include meetings with 
the Group’s largest institutional shareholders on an 
individual basis following the announcement of the 
Group’s interim and annual results. In addition, the Group 
responds to individual ad hoc requests for discussions 
from institutional shareholders. Following meetings held 
with shareholders after the interim and annual results 
announcements, the Board is provided with feedback 
from the Executive Directors, the Group’s brokers and 
its public relations advisers on investor perceptions. 
The Company’s brokers’ reports on the Group are also 
circulated to all Directors, as are monthly reports of 
significant changes in the holdings of larger investors.
The AGM, for which at least 20 working days’ notice 
 is given and where shareholders are invited to ask 
questions during the meeting and are able to meet with 
the Directors after the meeting, is normally attended by 
all the Directors. The number of proxy votes for, against or 
withheld in respect of each resolution is disclosed at the 
AGM and a separate resolution is proposed for each item.
The Group’s corporate website at www.informa.com 
contains a wide range of information of interest to 
both institutional and private investors, including any 
announcements made by the Company to the FSA 
as well as video recordings of the interim and annual 
presentations made to analysts.
g oing c oncern Basis 
The Group’s business activities, together with the factors 
likely to affect its future development, performance and 
position are set out in the Chairman’s Statement and 
Chief Executive’s Review on pages 14 to 18.
As set out on pages 31 to 36 a number of risk factors 
and uncertainties affect the Group’s results and financial 
position. In particular the current economic climate 
creates uncertainties over the level of demand for the 
Group’s products and services. The Group adopts an 
extensive budgeting process in forecasting its trading 
results and cash flows and updates these forecasts to 
reflect current trading on a regular basis.
The Group’s net debt and banking covenants are 
discussed in the Financial Review on pages 19 to 23 and 
the exposure to liquidity risk is discussed in Note 24 to 
the consolidated financial statements.
The Group sensitises its projections to reflect reasonably 
possible changes in trading performance and cash 
conversions, taking into account its substantial deferred 
revenues (£292m at 31 December 2009). These forecasts and 
projections for the period up to 30 June 2011, show that the 
Group is expected to be able to operate within the level of its 
current facility and meet its covenant requirements.
After making enquiries, the Directors have a reasonable 
expectation that the Company and the Group have 
adequate resources to continue in operational existence 
for the foreseeable future. Accordingly, they continue to 
adopt the going concern basis in preparing the annual 
report and financial statements.
Procedures to Deal with Directors’ 
c onflicts of Interest
The Company’s Articles, which were adopted by 
shareholders on 2 June 2009, include provisions  
covering Directors’ conflicts of interest. 
c o RPo Rate gove Rnance s tatement continued 41 Informa plc Annual Report & Financial Statements for the year ended 31 December 2009
The Articles allow the Board to authorise any matter that 
would otherwise involve a Director breaching his duty to 
avoid conflicts of interest. The Company has procedures in 
place to deal with a situation where a Director has a conflict of 
interest. As part of this process, the Board will endeavour to:
consider each conflict situation separately on its •	
particular facts;
consider the conflict situation in conjunction with •	
the Company’s Articles;
keep records and Board minutes as to authorisations •	
granted by Directors and the scope of any approvals 
given; and
regularly review conflict authorisations. •	
Internal c ontrol and Risk management
The Board is responsible for the Group’s system of 
internal control and for reviewing its effectiveness. Such 
a system is designed to manage rather than eliminate the 
risk of failure to achieve business objectives and can only 
provide reasonable, and not absolute, assurance against 
material misstatement or loss. The concept of reasonable 
assurance recognises that the cost of control procedures 
should not exceed the expected benefits.
The Board has an ongoing process for identifying, 
evaluating and managing the significant risks faced by 
the Group. This process was in place throughout the 
year under review and up to the date of approval of 
the Annual Report and Financial Statements, and is in 
accordance with the Turnbull Guidance “Internal Control: 
Revised Guidance for Directors on the Combined Code.”
The Board regularly reviews the effectiveness of the 
Group’s system of financial and non-financial internal 
controls, including operational and compliance controls, 
risk management and the Group’s high-level internal 
control arrangements.
The Board’s monitoring is based principally on reviewing 
reports from management to consider whether 
significant risks have been identified, evaluated, 
managed and controlled and whether any significant 
weaknesses are promptly remedied and indicate a need 
for more extensive monitoring.
In addition, the Board performs a formal risk 
assessment, which is embedded through the annual 
planning cycle into the operations of the Group. Each 
operating unit prepares a business plan, which sets out 
detailed objectives, which are submitted to Executive 
management and the Board for approval. As an integral 
part of the plan, each operating unit considers the 
significant risks to its business and to the achievement 
of the proposed plan. In doing so, each unit measures its 
progress and completion against a series of mitigating 
control actions designed to address these risks.
In consolidating unique risk events group-wide, this risk 
model not only assists in the allocation of Internal Audit 
resource to provide assurance on significant risks in its 
annual plan, but also enables both Executive Directors and 
the Audit Committee, which assists the Board in discharging 
its review responsibilities, to monitor operating units’ 
progress in implementing programmes aimed at mitigating 
risk. These review responsibilities are assisted by the 
operation of a risk committee. This committee comprises 
the Chief Executive, a cross section of senior officers and 
managers of the Group and is chaired by the Finance 
Director. The operation of the risk committee is subject to 
the oversight of the Audit Committee.
Board meetings and c ommittees
As a result of the high level of corporate activity during the 
year, 13 Board meetings, both scheduled and unscheduled 
were held. Not all Directors could be present at all 
unscheduled Board meetings. The number of scheduled 
Board meetings and Committee meetings attended as a 
member by each Director during the year are below.

Chairman, Derek Mapp, and also comprises John Davis 
and the Chief Executive, Peter Rigby. The Nomination 
Committee considers the mix of skills and experience 
that the Board requires and seeks the appointment of 
Directors who meet those requirements to ensure that 
the Board is effective in discharging its responsibilities. 
The Nomination Committee did not meet during 2009. 
The constitution of the Board’s committees for the 
Company to be effective following the Scheme becoming 
effective was determined by the Board as a whole.

The Committee’s terms of reference were updated 
and adopted on 24 June 2009, and are available on 
the Company’s website. The Committee’s principal 
responsibilities are to:
set, review and recommend to the Board for •	
approval the remuneration policy and strategy with 
respect to the Executive Directors;
set, review and approve the individual remuneration •	
packages of the Executive Directors including terms 
and conditions of employment and any changes to 
the packages; and
approve the introduction and rules of any Group •	
share-based incentive schemes.
a udit c ommittee
The membership of the Audit Committee comprises  
Dr Brendan O’Neill, as Chairman of the Committee, and 
John Davis, and from 27 April 2009, Dr Pamela Kirby.  
Sean Watson was a member until he ceased to be  
a Director on 8 May 2009. The Committee’s terms  
of reference were updated and adopted on  
24 June 2009, and are available on the Company’s 
website. The terms of reference are considered annually 
by the Audit Committee and are then referred to the 
Board for approval. It met four times during 2009.
The Audit Committee has at least one member possessing 
recent and relevant experience, as described in the Smith 
Report appended to the Code. Its Chairman, Dr Brendan 
O’Neill, has extensive experience of audit committee 
procedures, and John Davis is a qualified chartered 
accountant and the Chief Financial Officer of Yell Group 
plc, a listed company.
The Audit Committee monitors the integrity of 
the Group’s financial statements and any formal 
announcements relating to the Group’s performance. 
The Committee is responsible for monitoring the 
effectiveness of the external audit process and making 
recommendations to the Board in relation to the 
appointment, re-appointment and remuneration of the 
external auditors. It is responsible for ensuring that an 
appropriate relationship between the Group and the 
external auditors is maintained, including reviewing 
non-audit services and fees. The Committee also reviews 
annually the Group’s system of internal controls and 
the process for monitoring and evaluating the risks 
faced by the Group. It reviews the effectiveness of the 
Group Internal Audit function (which includes business 
risk management) and is responsible for approving, 
upon the recommendation of the Chief Executive, 
the appointment and termination of the head of that 
function. These responsibilities are principally carried 
out through the Risk Committee whose activities are 
overseen by the Chairman of the Audit Committee.
The Committee meets as appropriate with the Executive 
Directors and management, as well as privately with both 
the external and internal auditors.
In 2009 the Committee discharged its responsibilities 
primarily by:
reviewing the Group’s draft preliminary and interim •	
results statements prior to Board approval and 
reviewing the external auditors’ detailed reports 
thereon;
reviewing the Group’s interim management •	
statements and pre-close period updates prior  
to their release;
reviewing the appropriateness of the Group’s •	
accounting policies;
reviewing regularly the impact on the Group’s •	
financial statements of matters such as the adoption 
of International Financial Reporting Standards;
c o RPo Rate gove Rnance s tatement continued 43 Informa plc Annual Report & Financial Statements for the year ended 31 December 2009
recommending to the full Board, which adopted the •	
recommendation, the reappointment of Deloitte LLP 
as the Group’s external auditors;
reviewing and approving the audit fee and •	
reviewing non-audit fees payable to the Group’s 
external auditors;
reviewing the external auditors’ plan for the audit •	
of the Group’s financial statements, which included 
key areas of scope of work; key risks on the financial 
statements; confirmations of auditor independence 
and the proposed audit fee and approving the terms 
of engagement for the audit;
reviewing the Group’s system of controls and its •	
effectiveness;
reviewing the Group’s systems to identify and •	
manage risks (including regular consultation with 
the Head of Internal Audit);
reviewing the ongoing reports from Business Risk •	
Management; and
reviewing post-acquisition reports on integration •	
and performance of significant recent acquisitions 
compared to plans.
The Audit Committee also monitors the Group’s 
whistleblowing procedures to ensure that appropriate 
arrangements are in place for employees to be able to 
raise matters of possible impropriety in confidence, with 
suitable subsequent follow-up action.
The Audit Committee also undertakes a thorough 
performance evaluation which is led by the Chairman of 
the Committee.
external a uditors
The Audit Committee is also responsible for the 
development, implementation and monitoring 
of the Group’s policy on external audit. The policy 
assigns oversight responsibility for monitoring the 
independence, objectivity and compliance with ethical 
and regulatory requirements to the Audit Committee, 
and day to day responsibility to the Group Finance 
Director. It states that the external auditors are jointly 
responsible to the Board and the Audit Committee and 
that the Audit Committee is the primary contact. The 
policy also sets out the categories of non-audit services 
which the external auditors will and will not be allowed 
to provide to the group, subject to de minimis levels. 
To fulfil its responsibility regarding the independence of 
the external auditors, the Audit Committee reviewed:
the external auditors’ plan for the current year, noting •	
the role of the senior statutory audit partner, who 
signs the audit report and who, in accordance with 
professional rules, has not held office for more than 
five years, and any changes in the key audit staff;
the arrangements for day-to-day management of •	
the audit relationship;
a report from the external auditors describing their •	
arrangements to identify, report and manage any 
conflicts of interest; and
the overall extent of non-audit services provided by •	
the external auditors, in addition to its case-by-case 
approval of the provision of non-audit services by 
the external auditors.
To assess the effectiveness of the external auditors, the 
Audit Committee reviewed:
the arrangements for ensuring the external auditors’ •	
independence and objectivity;
the external auditors’ fulfilment of the agreed audit •	
plan and any variations from the plan;
the robustness and perceptiveness of the auditors •	
in their handling of the key accounting and audit 
judgements; and
the content of the external auditor’s reporting on •	
internal control.
Following the above, the Audit Committee has 
recommended to the Board that Deloitte LLP is re-appointed.

t he Year in Review
In determining the Executive Directors’ remuneration the Committee consulted the Chairman about its proposals; 
no Executive Director played a part in any decision about his or her own remuneration. The Committee also engaged 
independent remuneration consultants Hewitt New Bridge Street (Hewitt) to provide advice on the structure and 
operation of Directors’ remuneration packages and the Company’s share incentive arrangements. Hewitt were 
appointed by the Committee and do not provide any other material services to the Group. The Company Secretary, 
John Burton, also provided assistance to the Committee during the year.
Remuneration Policy
The remuneration of the Executive Directors is designed to provide for a competitive compensation package which 
reflects the Group’s performance against financial objectives and personal performance criteria. It rewards above-average 
performance and is designed to attract, motivate and retain high-calibre executives. The performance measurement of 
the Executive Directors and the determination of their annual remuneration packages are undertaken by the Committee.
There are five elements of the remuneration package for Executive Directors as follows:
basic annual salary; •	
benefits; •	
annual bonus; •	
share incentives; and •	
retirement and life assurance benefits. •	
The Company’s policy is that a clear majority of the maximum potential remuneration of the Executive Directors should 
be performance-related. As described further below, Executive Directors may earn an annual bonus and benefit from 
participation in a performance-based LTIP . For 2009, 80% of the maximum bonus payable to the Executive Directors 
was based on EPS performance and for 2010 is entirely based on EPS performance. Vesting of LTIP awards granted prior 
to 2009 have been conditional upon EPS growth and subject to a total shareholder return (TSR) underpin. LTIP awards 
granted after 2008 are subject solely to TSR performance as noted below.
The Remuneration Committee is able to consider corporate performance on environmental, social and governance 
issues when setting the remuneration of the Executive Directors. In its judgment the remuneration policies for both 
Executive Directors and senior management do not raise environmental, social or governance/operational risks by 
inadvertently motivating irresponsible behaviour.
Executive Directors are entitled to accept appointments outside of the Company provided that the Chairman 
determines that it is appropriate. During 2009 Peter Rigby served as Non-Executive Chairman of Electric Word plc, for 
which he received and retained fees of £12,000. 
Basic Salary
The basic salaries of the Executive Directors are reviewed by the Remuneration Committee prior to the beginning of 
each year and upon a change of position or responsibility. In deciding appropriate levels, the Committee considers 
pay practices in the Group as a whole and makes reference to objective research which gives current information on 
appropriate comparator groups of companies.
A review of the salaries of the Executive Directors was undertaken at the end of 2009 with the assistance of Hewitt. 
It included a comparison of benchmark data from two comparator groups of companies, one drawn from the FTSE 
All Share Media Index, of which the Company is a constituent member, and the other drawn from the FTSE All Share 
Index which comprised companies of a broadly similar size to Informa in terms of market capitalisation, turnover and 
overseas operations. Following its review, the Remuneration Committee concluded that it was appropriate reflecting 
widespread salary freezes across the Group to maintain the annual basic salaries of the Executive Directors for the 2010 
financial year at the same rates that were set in the Spring of 2008:
DIRecto Rs’ Remune Rat Ion Re Po Rt continued 47 Informa plc Annual Report & Financial Statements for the year ended 31 December 2009
P Rigby £700,000
A Walker £425,000
Benefits
Each of the Executive Directors receives a benefit allowance of £25,000 per annum together with private medical 
insurance cover and permanent health insurance cover.
Annual Bonus
The Remuneration Committee (the Committee) continues to consider adjusted diluted EPS to be the most suitable 
financial measurement to determine performance and align the interests of the Executive Directors with those of 
the Company’s shareholders for the purpose of determination of bonuses as this measurement of performance can 
be directly influenced by the performance of the Executive Directors and is a key driver in generating returns to 
shareholders. The Committee retains a discretion to look at other appropriate benchmarks. Accordingly, for 2009 it set 
an award of up to 20% of basic salary for the achievement of personal goals relating to the effective management of 
the Group’s financial position which were set with the aim of protecting and enhancing shareholder value. In addition, 
a bonus of up to 80% of basic salary was dependent upon achievement of a sliding scale of challenging diluted 
adjusted EPS targets which were set at levels to encourage and reward the delivery of excellent levels of performance. 
For 2009, the Committee determined that the personal goals had been met in full and accordingly an award of 20% 
of basic salary is payable to the Executive Directors. Applying the sliding scale formula, a bonus of 83.6% of basic 
salary was awarded to each of Mr Rigby and Mr Walker for the 2009 financial year, reflecting a year of resilient financial 
performance.
For 2010, the Committee has resolved to revert to a structure of the bonus opportunity being solely based on EPS 
targets. In addition, for 2010 it has extended the maximum award available from 100% of basic salary in 2009 to 125% 
of basic salary in 2010. However, in relation to this additional potential 25% bonus:
1 more stretching targets have been applied for its achievement; and
2 this additional award may only take the form of a conditional award of shares in the Company which will vest 
only if the Director remains in employment throughout the deferral period, subject to good leaver provisions. 
The number of shares awarded will be determined by reference to the market value of the shares at the date 
concurrent awards under the LTIP are made. Shares utilised for this purpose will be acquired by market purchase; 
newly issued shares will not be used. 
l ong-Term incentive Plan
From 2006 Executive Directors have been invited to participate in the Company’s LTIP , which had been introduced and 
approved by shareholders in 2005.
The first grant of awards to Executive Directors under the LTIP was made in March 2006 and they were given the 
alternative of:
a maximum award of 100% of basic salary in the Company’s shares, provided they are prepared to sacrifice 5% of •	
that year’s basic salary; or
a maximum award of 50% of basic salary in the Company’s shares, with no salary sacrifice required. •	
Mr Rigby, being the only Executive Director at that time who remains in office, opted for the maximum award with a 5% 
sacrifice in basic salary. Two further grants of awards were made in April 2007 and April 2008 on the same basis and Mr Rigby 
again opted for the maximum award with a 5% sacrifice in basic salary (as did Mr Walker in April 2008, his first year in office). Informa plc Annual Report & Financial Statements for the year ended 31 December 2009 48
t he Year in Review
The 2006 award made to Mr Rigby vested in full on 1 May 2009; further details can be found on page 53. The awards 
made to Mr Rigby in 2007 and to the Executive Directors in 2008 under the LTIP vest subject to continued employment 
over a three year performance period, including the year of award, and the satisfaction of performance conditions 
which require both that:
the Company’s TSR is at least at the median compared to the companies constituting, at grant, the FTSE All Share •	
Media Index; and
the Company’s average adjusted diluted EPS grows by at least RPI plus 5% per annum (for 20% of the award •	
to vest) increasing to RPI plus 12% per annum (for 100% of the award to vest), thereby encouraging Executive 
Directors to deliver above market returns to shareholders while also delivering strong financial performance.
The following revised arrangements for the LTIP were approved by shareholders at the AGM on 8 May 2009: 
1.  the above performance conditions will no longer apply and instead the following TSR performance conditions  
will be used:
one half of the shares under an award will vest based on the Company’s TSR performance ranked against •	
the TSR performance of the constituents of the FTSE 350 index (excluding investment trusts). This half of an 
award shall vest at 20% at median ranking and 100% at upper quintile ranking. Any ranking below median 
results in none of the award vesting; and
one half of the shares under an award will vest based on the Company’s TSR performance ranked against the TSR •	
performance of the constituents of the FTSE All Share Media Index. This half of an award will vest 20% at median 
ranking and 100% at upper quintile ranking. Any ranking below median results in none of the award vesting;
2 the maximum award has been increased to 200% of basic salary; and
3 no salary sacrifice element will apply. 
Awards were made to the Executive Directors in 2009 of 150% of basic salary and it is intended that the same size of 
award be made to the Executive Directors in 2010.
The shares awarded to participants of the LTIP grants are satisfied through the Informa Group Employee Share Trust 
(the EST), currently administered by Nautilus Trust Company Limited in Jersey. The current intention is to use existing 
issued shares held in the EST for the vesting of the 2007 LTIP grant to Mr Rigby. 
All-Employee Share Plans
From January 2006 the Executive Directors, along with all other UK employees, were eligible to participate in the 
Company’s Share Incentive Plan (SIP), introduced and approved by shareholders in 2005. The SIP is an Inland Revenue 
Approved All-Employee Share Incentive Plan which offers UK employees the opportunity to purchase up to £1,500 of 
shares in the Company per year out of pre-tax salary. 
All members of the SIP were invited to participate in the Rights Issue on 27 May 2009 and documentation was sent 
to participants on 8 May 2009. SIP participants who participated in the Rights Issue received shares separate to their 
holding in the SIP , equal to the value of their rights at the price of 150 pence per share. The rights of those participants 
who chose not to take part in the Rights Issue were sold and sale proceeds were distributed amongst the participants.
At a meeting of the Company held on 2 June 2009, a new Share Incentive Plan (new SIP) was approved by shareholders 
for its adoption pursuant to the Scheme becoming effective on 30 June 2009. The terms of the new SIP are the same  
in all material respects as the pre-existing SIP in Old Informa. The new SIP was approved by the Inland Revenue on  
6 July 2009. Eligible employees were invited to join the new SIP and can also join on an ongoing basis provided they 
have completed six months’ service with the Company.
The Company introduced a US Stock Purchase Plan (SPP) in 2008 which was approved by shareholders at the AGM in 
May 2008. Eligible employees are invited to join the SPP on an ongoing basis once they have completed six months’ 
DIRecto Rs’ Remune Rat Ion Re Po Rt continued 49 Informa plc Annual Report & Financial Statements for the year ended 31 December 2009
service with the Company. The SPP provides a means by which the Group’s US employees may purchase the Company’s 
shares at a 15% discount to the market price. No tax benefit is available under the SPP . Eligible US employees can 
purchase up to $2,940 of shares per year out of post-tax salary.
As US shareholders were not entitled to participate in the Rights Issue, the trustee of the SPP arranged for the automatic sale of 
the rights of participants in the SPP at the end of the Rights Issue period in the same way as US shareholders, and, accordingly 
the proceeds of the sale were paid to participants. Shares in Old Informa held in the SPP at the time of the Scheme becoming 
effective were exchanged for shares in the Company; accordingly no new SPP was introduced at this date.
Share Options
Prior to their merger in May 2004, both Informa and Taylor & Francis operated discretionary share option schemes for the 
benefit of the Executive Directors. In the light of changes to the accounting treatment for share options and changing market 
practice, the Remuneration Committee decided in 2005 no longer to grant options to Executive Directors. Details of subsisting 
options granted to the Executive Directors in 2004 and earlier are shown on page 52. Existing grants were amended for the 
Rights Issue on 27 May 2009 and rolled over from Old Informa to the Company pursuant to the Scheme becoming effective.
Share Ownership g uidelines
During early 2006 the Remuneration Committee introduced formal share ownership guidelines requiring the Executive 
Directors to build up, over a three year period and with pre-existing shareholdings taken into account, a holding in the 
Company’s shares equal to at least one and a half times annual basic salary.
Retirement and life Assurance Benefits
The Executive Directors are entitled to receive a contribution of 25% of basic salary toward their retirement 
arrangements. The Company also provides life assurance cover providing for the payment of a lump sum in the event 
of the insured’s death in service.
Since Peter Rigby is neither an active member of any Group pension scheme nor is eligible to make further tax efficient 
pension contributions, instead the Company pays to him a monthly payment in lieu of pension contributions equal to 
25% of basic salary (after deducting the incremental National Insurance costs to the Company).
Further details of these entitlements are shown on page 53 to 54.
Performance g raph
The graph below shows the Company’s performance, measured by TSR, compared with the performance of the FTSE All 
Share Media Index, also measured by TSR, in the five-year period ended 31 December 2009. The FTSE All Share Media 
Index has been selected for this comparison because the Company is a constituent company of that index.

Directors’ Contracts
At 31 December 2009 and in accordance with the Company’s policy, each of the Executive Directors had service  
contracts with an indefinite term under which 12 months’ notice must be given by the Company or by the Director. 
On 24 June 2009 the Executive Directors entered into new agreements with Informa, the new holding company, in 
respect of their duties and responsibilities as Directors of that company. The existing service contracts of the Executive 
Directors were amended on 24 June 2009 to reflect this additional appointment but otherwise the terms of their original 
agreements were unaffected. In the event of early termination, their contracts provide for compensation equal to basic 
salary, benefits allowance and retirement benefit and (in the case of Peter Rigby only, bonus) for the notice period.
Pursuant to the terms on which he joined the Group, Adam Walker was awarded a restricted award of 93,269 shares on 
7 April 2008. This award was increased to 117,422 shares following the taking up in full by Mr Walker of his rights in the 
Rights Issue on 27 May 2009 and will vest in full on 7 April 2010. 
Other than in respect of Mr Walker’s share award described above, there are no specific terms in relation to the 
service contracts concerning termination following a change of control or any special rules concerning equity awards 
following termination; the Executive Directors are subject to the same rules and awards under share schemes following 
a termination of employment as for all other participants of the relevant schemes.
Each of the Non-Executive Directors has specific terms of appointment, terminable by three months’ notice. The dates 
of the Directors’ original contracts are shown in the table below, although the contracts have been amended from 
time to time by letter agreement as required to reflect changes to, for example, salary or fee levels. The contracts of the 
Non-Executive Directors were novated on 24 June 2009 so as to be with Informa as the new holding company of the 
Group. However the terms of the contracts remain the same. The contracts, which include details of remuneration, are 
available for inspection at the registered office and will be available for inspection at the AGM.

other Group companies. In addition to the beneficial interests in the shares of the Company shown above, during 2009  
Peter Rigby and Adam Walker were, for the purposes of the Act, regarded as interested in the ordinary shares held  
by Nautilus Trust Company Limited, as trustee of the Informa Group Employee Share Trust. This trust held 71,628 shares  
at 31 December 2009. Employees of the Group (including Peter Rigby and Adam Walker) are potential beneficiaries  
under this trust. 
Other than the purchase of 154 Share Incentive Plan shares by Peter Rigby and Adam Walker, there have been no 
changes in Directors’ share interests from 31 December 2009 to the date of this Report.

conditions and continued employment, these awards will vest proportionately, over a three year performance 
period, commencing on 1 January of the year of grant. The Remuneration Committee was satisfied that the 
performance conditions covering Mr Rigby’s award made in 2006 had been met in full and accordingly all his award vested 
on 1 May 2009. The share price and value of the share award on the date of vesting was 339.75p and £397,786 respectively. 
Of the 117,082 shares vesting under the award, Mr Rigby received 69,082 and sold 48,000. The Remuneration Committee was 
satisfied under the performance conditions covering Mr Rigby’s award made in 2007 that 40.2% of his award should vest in 
March 2010.
Directors’ Pension Entitlements
The following information is given to comply with the requirements of the Listing Rules of the FSA, which differ in some 
respects from the equivalent statutory requirements:
There were no increases during the year of accrued pension (excluding inflation). Any transfer values disclosed 
under the Listing Rules requirements do not represent a sum paid or payable to the individual Director; instead they 
represent a potential liability of the pension scheme. Informa plc Annual Report & Financial Statements for the year ended 31 December 2009 54

 The Committee has resolved not to make a bonus payment to Mr Rigby for 2009. Instead, the Committee has decided to make a contribution of £585,200 (the 
Contribution Amount) to the Informa Group 2010 Employer-Financed Retirement Benefits Scheme (EFRBS), where it will be invested to provide retirement and/or 
death benefits to Mr Rigby. As this contribution will not be immediately and fully deductible for corporation tax purposes, the Committee has decided to make the 
contribution in two stages in order to have a neutral effect on the Group’s cashflow, when compared with the payment of a bonus. The first payment of £475,276 
(representing 81.216% of the Contribution Amount) was paid to the EFRBS in March 2010 and the balance of the Contribution Amount will be paid to the EFRBS in 
the year in which Mr Rigby draws down his benefits under the EFRBS. This remuneration report records both payments being made to Mr Rigby in respect of the 2009 
financial year, irrespective of the timing of these payments.

Corporate Responsibility (CR) is key to the Informa 
business and its people. Its importance within Informa 
increases year on year even in a difficult business 
environment. Informa’s CR activities are carried out 
globally across the business and incorporate many 
different areas such as employees, communities, 
customers and the environment.
As mentioned in the Corporate Governance report on 
page 43 to 44, Informa’s CR strategy is formulated and 
led by a CR Committee which is chaired by the Chief 
Executive, Peter Rigby. The CR strategy has five key pillars:
Providing a Rewarding, Fair and 
Inspiring w orkplace for s taff
The quality of Informa’s people is the Company’s single 
biggest advantage. The Group is rich in intellectual 
capital. It has a responsibility to provide a transparent 
and unbiased meritocracy as well as invest in the HR tools 
to support this.
In 2009, internal staff training (known as the Informa 
Academy) was further developed. It is delivered by the 
Informa Group and is free to attend for employees from 
all of the Group’s businesses. Attendance at these courses 
rose from 853 to 1,253 staff in 2009. Individual businesses 
are being encouraged to establish their own training 
academies; in 2009 Informa Business Information did so, 
delivering specialist training directly to its staff. 
Informa continues to offer a flexible and attractive 
benefits package to staff on top of the competitive salary 
and bonus structures in place within each business unit. 
The Group’s UK benefits package was given the highest 
rating in the Britain’s Top Employer awards for 2009.
In 2009, Informa launched an innovative new facility for 
previous members of staff throughout the world.  Over 
time, INFORMA-IN-TOUCH.ORG, will help the Group build 
a strong, global alumnus of talented former-employees, 
with whom the Group will remain in contact.
INFORMA-IN-TOUCH.ORG offers a supportive peer 
group for former staff enabling them to hear about new 
opportunities, business and social events as well as gain tips 
and advice in finding a new job, managing their career, and, 
if they choose it, self-employment. A Network Coach, with 
many years experience in executive coaching and personal 
development, is also on hand. His job is to welcome new 
members and support their career development and 
networking. It is one of few, such proactive, corporate 
alumni networks in the world.  In time offline networking 
amongst this group will be developed.
To offer users privacy, it is not open to current employees, 
but it does give Informa the opportunity to get back 
in touch with people who have moved when new 
opportunities arise within the Group.
ensuring Product Integrity and Quality
Informa provides specialist information and services for 
the academic, scientific, professional, and commercial 
business communities. Our readers and the people 
attending our conferences expect expertly researched, 
balanced, truthful and reliable content.
managing Editorial integrity at Taylor & Francis
Taylor & Francis (T&F) maintains the editorial integrity of their 
academic publications in three ways that are all closely related 
to each other. 
Firstly, there is a rigorous peer review process made up of 
subject experts, mainly academic professors, to validate the 
content of T&F’s books and journals. On the journal side, 
each title has an editorial panel, whilst books are reviewed 
by three or more experts. Sometimes this can lead to content 
changes and, on the rare occasion, to an article or book being 
abandoned altogether.
Secondly, T&F recognises that, as a humanities and social sciences 
publisher, it needs to be at the forefront of stimulating debate. The 
peer review process plays an important part in this by ensuring 
that all content is challenged and debated before publication.
Finally, as a global publisher, T&F prides itself on its 
commitment to reflecting regional perspectives. This also 
contributes to the desire to lead the debate in core subject 
areas through thought-provoking content.
T&F have commissioning staff located in the UK, USA, India 
and Singapore. Sales outside of the UK and USA account 
for approximately 40% of T&F’s total sales and this figure is 
growing each year. T&F believes that in every respect the 
developing regions of the world are going to be increasingly 
important to its business.

In 2009, a review of the Editorial and Content Code for 
publishing was conducted, and development of specific 
training sessions commenced to raise awareness of the 
code among Informa Business Information’ publications. 
Although the publishing code is relevant for the Group’s 
academic books and journals, the integrity of those 
publications is ensured through the Group’s peer review 
process before publication.
An Editorial and Content code was drafted specifically for 
the conference businesses in 2009, and will be finalised 
and launched during 2010.
T&F have commissioning staff located in the UK, USA,

this figure is growing each year. T&F believes that in every 
respect the developing regions of the world are going to 
be increasingly important to its business.
managing environmental Impacts
Informa continues to measure and manage the 
environmental impacts of its direct operations.  
Previously the Group has focused on UK operations but 
this year it will report on a broader geographical scope 
of its operations including North America, East Asia, 
Australasia, and South Asia. The Group continues to 
report to investors via the Carbon Disclosure Project, and 
saw its score in the index increase slightly this year.
The Group’s reporting in 2009 has been focused on 
energy usage within its offices, and in 2010 reporting  
will include the impacts associated with business travel.
maintaining and Improving 
c ustomer s ervice l evels
It is the Group’s responsibility to anticipate, meet 
and exceed its institutional and individual customer 
expectations. The Group continues to develop its Shared 
Service Centres offering back office customer service 
functions to group companies. The Shared Service 
Centres are expected to lead to cost savings as well as 
improvements to customer service levels. 
For example, the UK Shared Services’ main role is to 
support Informa’s businesses, so that they can focus 
on improving products and services, ensure customer 
retention and grow their businesses. The Shared Services 
centre does this by not only providing accounting 
and customer operations support services to these 
businesses, but also by processing first line external 
customer queries. 
g iving Back to the c ommunities 
in which it o perates
Informa has long encouraged its staff to be involved 
in local community initiatives, as well as taking part in 
Group community activities such as fund raising for the 
World Cancer Research Fund (WCRF). A survey carried 
out in 2009 showed how important these activities are to 
Informa’s staff, as well as having a positive effect on the 
green Week 
Informa launched its first Green week in 2009 to build on 2008’s 
Green day. The aim of the week was to set aside time in the 
corporate calendar to bring green issues to the fore and inspire 
employees across the globe to make positive green changes in 
their day-to-day working lives as well as to share ideas on how 
Informa could reduce its corporate carbon footprint. 
The Group received a high amount of input from employees 
to central competitions, for example sending in ideas for 
“Greening Informa’s Products” and photos on “Going Green 
at Informa” . There was also support from Peter Rigby, Chief 
Executive, and his direct reports who competed in their own 
“Green Games” , a set of daily challenges on the five themes  
of mind, travel, waste, water, and energy. 
Competition between the competitive senior team was fierce 
with the ups and downs all captured in a daily blog. Employees 
also organised activities in their local offices from carpooling  
to volunteering with environmental charities as well as  
getting rid of personal bins in offices and creating one- 
sided notebooks from scrap printer paper. 
Finally, Facilities’ Managers were put to the test challenging 
them to see who could reduce office energy use the most over 
the week. Eighteen offices across eight countries took up the 
gauntlet with Taylor & Francis in Singapore eventually winning 
with a 42% saving achieved through simple measures such as 
reducing the air-conditioning by a few degrees, turning off all 
lighting and electronic devices when not in use, and keeping 
window blinds down to avoid heat gain from direct sunlight. 
Informa Australia also deserve a mention for making the 
greatest absolute saving before normalisation. 57 Informa plc Annual Report & Financial Statements for the year ended 31 December 2009
communities with whom the Group works.
Informa also recognises that these community activities 
are another way to help staff develop new skills. In 2009, 
the Group developed a new community strategy which 
includes offering all staff one day off per year to volunteer 
for a local charity. Informa hopes to see a significant 
portion of staff taking up this new opportunity.  
l ooking Forward to 2010
The CR Committee has several key aims for 2010. These 
include the following:
staff engagement
Engaging with staff remains an important part of the CR 
strategy. The decentralisation of CR to the businesses 
globally and setting each business one key CR target are 
underway.
c ommunity
Staff are encouraged to spend one day for community 
activities. This has been branded ‘Be Involved’ with the 
aim of encouraging team activities globally.
h aiti a ppeal
Since the Haiti earthquake struck, Informa staff around the 
world have engaged minds and hearts and dug deep into 
their pockets to raise over £26,000 for the disaster relief in Haiti. 
Peter Rigby has announced that Informa will be contributing 
an additional £20,000 from corporate funds in honour of the 
response from staff, taking the total up to over £46,000.
Banana Run – Run for the children 
Staff across Informa continue to promote the Run for the 
Children and continue to raise funds for Cancer Relief. 
Peter Rigby puts his own stamp on this community event 
by dressing up as a banana and having staff chase him 
around Regents Park in London.
Informa a cademy
The CR Committee is working to improve the Profile of the 
Informa Academy, to offer more internal programmes for staff 
by using distance learning and Video Conferencing Technology 
to deliver these programmes. Virtual conferencing, developed 
in the ESI business in 2009, will be developed further in 
2010 thereby reducing the Group’s Carbon Footprint by 
minimising on business travel wherever possible.
c R Database/KPIs
Mindful of the need to provide the market with accurate 
data, particularly energy consumption, the CR Committee 
is looking to improve both the Group’s CR database and 
KPIs in line with the Carbon Disclosure project.
The full CR report for 2009 is available on www.informa.com.
Community Strategy Survey
A Community Strategy survey was undertaken in 2009 which 
gave the following results:
• 	 9 9 % 	 o f 	 t h o s e 	 t h a t 	 re p l i e d 	 t o 	 t h e 	 s u r ve y 	 k n e w 	 a b o u t

money for WCRF;
• 	 86%	of	r esponden ts	said	they	w ould	be	in t er est ed	in	getting

After analysing the results of the survey, and talking to  
MDs across the business, the CR Committee decided to:
•	 retain 	 its 	 global 	 rela tionship 	 with 	 WCRF 	 through 	 the 
 Go Banana event;

business, and offer support and advice to staff interested  
in setting up partnerships in their region, or getting  
involved in volunteering. Informa plc Annual Report & Financial Statements for the year ended 31 December 2009 58
”2009 will be remembered as one of the most difficult years 
from a global trading perspective. All of our businesses were 
impacted to a lesser or greater extent, so we are pleased 
with these financial results which demonstrate the strength 
of a balanced portfolio and an ability to manage costs 
proactively when demand is reduced.”

Independent Aud Itors’ r eport 
to the Members of Informa plc
We have audited the Group financial statements (the 
financial statements) of Informa plc for the year ended 
31 December 2009 which comprise the Consolidated Income 
Statement, the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive 
Income, the Consolidated Statement of Changes in Equity, 
the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position and the 
Consolidated Cash Flow Statement and the related Notes 1 
to 38. These financial statements have been prepared under 
the accounting policies set out therein. We have also audited 
the information in the Directors’ Remuneration Report that is 
described as having been audited.
We have reported separately on the parent company financial 
statements of Informa plc for the period from 11 March 2009  
to 31 December 2009.
This report is made solely to the Company’s members, as a 
body, in accordance with Article 110 of the Companies (Jersey) 
Law 1991. Our audit work has been undertaken so that we 
might state to the Company’s members those matters we 
are required to state to them in an auditors’ report and for no 
other purpose. To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do 
not accept or assume responsibility to anyone other than the 
Company and the Company’s members as a body, for our audit 
work, for this report, or for the opinions we have formed.
r espective responsibilities of directors and auditors
The Directors' responsibilities for preparing the Annual 
Report and the Group financial statements in accordance with 
applicable law and International Financial Reporting Standards 
(IFRSs) as adopted by the European Union, and for preparing 
the Directors’ Remuneration Report are set out in the Statement 
of Directors’ Responsibilities.
Our responsibility is to audit the financial statements in 
accordance with relevant legal and regulatory requirements 
and International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland).
We report to you our opinion as to whether the financial 
statements give a true and fair view and are properly prepared 
in accordance with the Companies (Jersey) Law 1991. We also 
report to you if, in our opinion, the Directors' Report is not 
consistent with the financial statements, if the Company has 
not kept proper accounting records or if we have not received 
all the information and explanations we require for our audit.
Although not required to do so, the directors have voluntarily 
chosen to make a Corporate Governance Statement detailing 
the extent of their compliance with the 2008 Combined Code. 
We review whether the Corporate Governance Statement 
reflects the Company’s compliance with the nine provisions of 
the 2008 Combined Code specified for our review by the Listing 
Rules of the Financial Services Authority, and we report if it 
does not. We are not required to consider whether the Board’s 
statements on internal control cover all risks and controls, or 
form an opinion on the effectiveness of the Group’s corporate 
governance procedures or its risk and control procedures. 
We read the other information contained in the Annual Report 
as described in the contents section and consider whether it is 
consistent with the audited financial statements. We consider 
the implications for our report if we become aware of any 
apparent misstatements or material inconsistencies with the 
financial statements.
Basis of audit opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with International 
Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland) issued by the Auditing 
Practices Board. An audit includes examination, on a test basis,  
of evidence relevant to the amounts and disclosures in the 
financial statements and the part of the Directors Remuneration 
report to be audited. It also includes an assessment of the 
significant estimates and judgments made by the Directors  
in the preparation of the financial statements, and of whether 
the accounting policies are appropriate to the Group's 
circumstances, consistently applied and adequately disclosed.
We planned and performed our audit so as to obtain all  
the information and explanations which we considered 
necessary in order to provide us with sufficient evidence to 
give reasonable assurance that the financial statements are free 
from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or other 
irregularity or error. In forming our opinion we also evaluated 
the overall adequacy of the presentation of information 
in the financial statements and the part of the Directors’ 
Remuneration Report to be audited.
o pinion
In our opinion:
the Group financial statements give a true and fair view, in •	
accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the European Union, 
of the state of the Group’s affairs as at 31 December 2009 
and of the Group’s profit for the year then ended; and
the Group financial statements have been properly prepared •	
in accordance with the Companies (Jersey) Law 1991.

For the year ended 31 December 2009
1 g eneral information
On 30 June 2009, pursuant to a Scheme of Arrangement under Part 26 of the UK Companies Act 2006, a new parent company was 
introduced which is now called Informa plc (the Company). The previous parent company has been renamed as Informa Group plc 
(Old Informa).
The introduction of a new parent company constitutes a Group reconstruction and has been accounted for as a reverse acquisition 
in accordance with IFRS 3 Business Combinations (2004). The comparative equity structure has been restated to reflect the new equity 
structure of the Company. Therefore, although the Group reconstruction did not become effective until 30 June 2009, the consolidated 
financial statements of the Company are presented as if the Company had always been part of the Group. Accordingly, the results of 
the Group for the year ended 31 December 2009 are shown in the Consolidated Income Statement and the comparative figures for the 
year ended 31 December 2008 are also presented on this basis. Earnings per share are unaffected by the reorganisation. The Company 
is incorporated in Jersey under the Companies (Jersey) Law 1991 and headquartered in Switzerland. The address of the registered office 
is given on page 29. The consolidated financial statements as at 31 December 2009 and for year then ended comprise those of the 
Company and its subsidiaries and its interests in associates and jointly controlled entities (together referred to as the Group).
The nature of the Group’s operations and its principal activities are set out in the Principal Activities and Business Review sections of 
the Directors’ Report on page 27.
The consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis, for further analysis refer to Corporate 
Governance Statement on page 38.
These financial statements are presented in pounds sterling (GBP) because that is the currency of the primary economic environment 
in which the Group operates. Foreign operations are included in accordance with the policies set out in Note 3.
These financial statements have been presented to the nearest £million, instead of £’000 as previously reported. The comparative 
figures have been adjusted accordingly.
Adoption of new and revised International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs)
Standards and interpretations adopted in the current period 
The following new standards, amendments and interpretations have been adopted in the current year:
IAS 1 (revised 2007) Presentation of Financial Statements 
IAS 23 (revised 2007) Borrowing Costs 
IAS 32 (amended) / IAS 1 (amended) Puttable Financial Instruments and Obligations Arising on Liquidation 
IAS 39 (amended) / IFRIC 9 (amended) Embedded derivatives  
IFRS 1 (amended) / IAS 27 (amended) Cost of an Investment in a Subsidiary, Jointly Controlled Entity or Associate 
IFRS 2 (amended) Share-based Payment – Vesting Conditions and Cancellations  
IFRS 7 (amended) Financial Instruments: disclosures  
IFRS 8 Operating Segments 
IFRIC 12 Service Concession Arrangements 
IFRIC 13 Customer Loyalty Programmes  
IFRIC 15 Agreements for the Construction of Real Estate 
IFRIC 16 Hedges of a Net Investment in a Foreign Operation  
Improvements to IFRSs (2008)
The adoption of these Standards and Interpretations has not led to any changes in the Group’s accounting policies except for 
adopting IFRS 7, IFRS 8 and IAS 1, which have only effected the presentation and disclosure in these financial statements.
IFRS 7 (amended) expands the disclosures required in respect of fair value measurements and liquidity risk. The Group has elected 
not to provide comparative information for these expanded disclosures in the current year in accordance with the transitional reliefs 
offered in this amendment. 67 Informa plc Annual Report & Financial Statements for the year ended 31 December 2009
IFRS 8 requires operating segments to be identified on the basis of internal reports about components of the Group that are  
regularly reviewed by the Board of Directors to allocate resources and to assess performance. In contrast, the predecessor Standard 
(IAS 14 Segment Reporting) required the Group to identify two sets of segments (business and geographical), using a risks and 
rewards approach, with the Group’s system of internal financial reporting to key management personnel serving only as the starting 
point for the identification of such segments. As a result, following the adoption of IFRS 8, the identification of the Group’s reportable 
segments has changed. 
IAS 1 (revised 2007) requires the presentation of a statement of changes in equity as a primary statement, separate from the income 
statement and statement of comprehensive income. As a result, a Consolidated Statement of Changes in Equity has been included 
in the primary statements, showing changes in each component of equity for each period presented. Further, IAS 1 requires a third 
comparative to be included within the Statement of Financial Position (along with supplementary notes) in the instance that any 
previously reported financial information is restated or represented. In the current year, the Group restructuring and adoption of IFRS 
8 triggers this requirement. However, the Board of Directors have concluded that the addition of the 2007 comparative information 
would not provide the user of the consolidated financial statements with any additional helpful information or enhance the overall 
clarity of the consolidated financial statements, given a full explanation of the impact of both IFRS 8 and the Group restructuring are 
provided in the Notes 6 and 25 respectively.
Standards and interpretations in issue, not yet adopted 
At the date of authorisation of these financial statements, the following Standards and Interpretations which have not been applied 
in these financial statements were in issue but have not yet come into effect:
IAS 24 (revised 2009) Related Party Disclosures – not endorsed by the EU 
IAS 27 (amended 2008) Consolidated and Separate Financial Statements  – endorsed by the EU 
IAS 28 (revised 2008) Investments in Associates  – endorsed by the EU 
IAS 32 (amended 2009) Classification of Rights Issues  – endorsed by the EU 
IAS 39 (amended 2009) Recognition and Measurement: Eligible Hedged Items – endorsed by the EU 
IFRS 2 (amended 2009) Group Cash-settled Share-based Payment Transactions    – not endorsed by the EU 
IFRS 3 (revised 2008) Business Combinations  – endorsed by the EU 
IFRS 9 Financial Instruments  – not endorsed by the EU 
IFRIC 14 (amended 2009) Prepayments of a Minimum Funding Requirement – not endorsed by the EU 
IFRIC 17 Distributions of Non-cash Assets to Owners  – endorsed by the EU 
IFRIC 18 Transfers of Assets from Customers   – endorsed by the EU 
IFRIC 19 Extinguishing financial liabilities with equity instruments   – not endorsed by the EU 
Improvements to IFRSs (2009)  – not endorsed by the EU
The Directors anticipate that the adoption of these Standards and Interpretations in future periods will have no material impact on 
the financial statements of the Group, except for: 
Treatment of acquisition of subsidiaries when IFRS 3 (revised 2008) comes into effect for business combinations for which the •	
acquisition date is on or after the beginning of the first annual period beginning on or after 1 July 2009.
IFRS 9 is a new standard which enhances the ability of investors and other users of financial information to understand the •	
accounting of financial assets and reduces complexity. IFRS 9 uses a single approach to determine whether a financial asset is 
measured at amortised cost or fair value, replacing the many different rules in IAS 39. This standard is effective for accounting 
periods commencing on or after 1 January 2013 and therefore the Group has not commenced its evaluation of the impact on  
the Group’s reported profit or net assets.  68

2 Basis of preparation
The financial statements have been prepared in accordance with IFRS adopted by the European Union and therefore comply with 
Article 4 of the EU IAS Regulations.
Adjusted results
Management believe that adjusted results and adjusted earnings per share (Note 14) provide additional useful information 
on underlying trends to shareholders. These measures are used for internal performance analysis and incentive compensation 
arrangements for employees. The term ‘adjusted’ is not a defined term under IFRS and may not therefore be comparable with 
similarly titled profit measurements reported by other companies. It is not intended to be a substitute for, or superior to IFRS 
measurements of profit. The principal adjustments made are in respect of:
restructuring and reorganisation costs – the costs incurred by the Group in reorganising and integrating acquired businesses, •	
non-recurring business restructuring, closure or disposal of businesses and costs associated with Board level changes; and 
amortisation and impairment of other intangible assets – the Group continues to amortise other intangible assets and  •	
test for impairment of these assets. The amortisation charge in respect of intangible software assets is included in the adjusted 
results. The amortisation charge in respect of  all remaining other intangible assets is excluded from the adjusted results as 
management does not see these charges as integral to underlying trading.
The Group’s operations are split into three broad market sectors of Academic Information, Professional & Commercial Information 
and Events & Training. These divisions are further analysed into more specific segments which bring together products in comparable 
market areas under common business heads. This is how the Group’s operational management is structured and its results are 
reviewed and thus form the reporting segments (Note 6).

3 Accounting policies
Basis of accounting
The financial statements have been prepared on the historical cost basis, except for the revaluation of certain assets and financial 
instruments. The principal accounting policies adopted, all of which have been consistently applied, are set out below. 
Basis of consolidation
The consolidated financial statements incorporate the accounts of the Company and all of its subsidiaries. The consolidated financial 
statements are prepared on a going concern basis. Control is achieved where the Company has the power to govern the financial 
and operating policies of an investee entity so as to obtain benefits from its activities. The results of subsidiaries acquired or sold 
are included in the consolidated financial statements from the effective date of acquisition or up to the effective date of disposal, as 
appropriate. Where necessary, adjustments are made to the results of acquired subsidiaries to bring their accounting policies into 
line with those used by other members of the Group. 
All intra-group transactions, balances, income and expense are eliminated on consolidation.
Minority interest in the net assets of consolidated subsidiaries are identified separately from the Group’s equity and consist of the 
amount of those interests at the date of the original business combination plus their share of changes in equity since that date.
Revenue 
Revenue is measured at the fair value of consideration received or receivable and represents amounts receivable for goods and 
services provided in the normal course of business, net of discounts, VAT and other sales related taxes, and provisions for returns 
and cancellations. 
Subscription income is deferred and recognised over the term of the subscription. 
Exhibition income is deferred and recognised when the exhibition is held. 
Delegates’ income represents fees earned and is recognised when the event is held. 
Copy sales revenue is recognised on the sale of the directory or publication.
Advertising revenue is recognised on issue of the publication.
Consulting and training revenues are recognised as services are delivered. Where consultancy services are provided over a period 
of time, revenue is recognised using the stage of completion method when the outcome of the contract can be measured reliably. 
The stage of completion is determined with regard to key milestones in the contract being attained and the percentage of services 
performed under the contract as a percentage of the total services to be performed. 
Interest income
Interest income is accrued on a time basis, by reference to the principal outstanding and at the effective interest rate applicable, 
which is the rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash receipts through the expected life of the financial asset to that asset’s 
net carrying amount.
Dividend income
Dividend income from investments is recognised when the shareholders’ rights to receive payment have been established.
Business combinations
The acquisition of subsidiaries is accounted for using the purchase method. The cost of an acquisition is measured at the aggregate 
of fair values, at the date of exchange, of assets given, liabilities incurred or assumed, and equity instruments issued by the Group in 
exchange for control of the acquiree, plus any costs directly attributable to the business combination. The acquiree’s identifiable assets, 
liabilities and contingent liabilities that meet the conditions for recognition under IFRS 3 (2004) are recognised at their fair value at the 
acquisition date, except for non-current assets (or disposal groups) that are classified as held for sale in accordance with IFRS 5 Non-
Current Assets Held for Sale and Discontinued Operations, which are recognised and measured at fair value less costs to sell. 70

3 Accounting policies continued 
Goodwill
Goodwill arising on the acquisition of subsidiary companies and businesses is calculated as the excess of purchase consideration 
over the fair value of net identifiable assets and liabilities at the date of acquisition. It is recognised as an asset at cost, assessed for 
impairment at least annually and subsequently measured at cost less accumulated impairment losses. Any impairment is recognised 
immediately in the Income Statement and is not subsequently reversed.
For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill is allocated to each of the Group’s cash generating units, as defined by the Board 
for internal management purposes, expected to benefit from the combination. Goodwill is tested for impairment annually or 
more frequently when there is an indication that it may be impaired. Where an impairment test is performed a discounted cash 
flow analysis is carried out based on the cash flows of the cash generating unit compared with the carrying value of that goodwill. 
Management estimate the discount rates as the risk affected cost of capital for the particular cash generating units. If the recoverable 
amount of the cash generating unit is less than the carrying amount of the unit, the impairment loss is allocated first to reduce the 
carrying amount of any goodwill allocated to the unit and then to the other assets of the unit pro-rata on the basis of the carrying 
amount of each asset in the unit. 
Upon disposal, the attributable carrying value of goodwill is included in the calculation of the profit or loss on disposal.
Intangible assets
Intangible assets are initially measured at cost. For business combinations, cost is calculated based on the Group’s valuation 
methodologies (Note 4). These assets are amortised over their estimated useful lives on a straight line basis, which are as follows:
Book lists 20 years 
Journal titles 20 - 40 years  
Database content and intellectual property 4 - 10 years 
Large scale events and exhibitions 8 - 10 years
Software, which is not integral to a related item of hardware, is included in intangible assets. Capitalised internal-use software costs 
include external direct costs of materials and services consumed in developing or obtaining the software, and payroll and payroll 
related costs for employees who are directly associated with, and who devote substantial time to, the project. Capitalisation of these 
costs ceases no later than the point at which the project is substantially complete and ready for its internal purpose. These costs are 
amortised on a straight line basis over their expected useful lives which are deemed to be 3-10 years. 
The expected useful lives of intangible assets are reviewed annually.
The Group does not have any intangible assets with indefinite lives.
Property and equipment
Property and equipment is recorded at cost less accumulated depreciation and provision for impairment. Depreciation is provided to 
write off the cost less the estimated residual value of property and equipment on a straight line basis over the estimated useful lives 
of the assets. The rates of depreciation are as follows:
Freehold buildings 50 years 
Leasehold land and buildings Over life of the lease  
Equipment, fixtures and fittings 3 - 15 years 
Freehold land is not depreciated.  
The gain or loss arising on the disposal or retirement of an asset is determined as the difference between the net sale proceeds and 
the carrying amount of the asset and is recognised in the Income Statement. 71 Informa plc Annual Report & Financial Statements for the year ended 31 December 2009
Impairment of tangible and intangible assets excluding goodwill
At each reporting date, the Group reviews the carrying amounts of its tangible and intangible assets to determine whether there is 
any indication that those assets have suffered an impairment loss. If any such indication exists, the recoverable amount of the asset 
is estimated in order to determine the extent of the impairment loss (if any). Where the asset does not generate cash flows that are 
independent from other assets, the Group estimates the recoverable amount of the cash generating unit to which the asset belongs.
Recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs to sell and value in use. In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash 
flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of 
money and the risks specific to the asset for which the estimates of future cash flows have not been adjusted.
If the recoverable amount of an asset (or cash generating unit) is estimated to be less than its carrying amount, the carrying amount of 
the asset (or cash generating unit) is reduced to its recoverable amount. An impairment loss is recognised as an expense immediately, 
unless the relevant asset is carried at a revalued amount, in which case the impairment loss is treated as a revaluation decrease.
Non-current assets classified as held for sale
Non-current assets (and disposal groups) classified as held for sale are measured at the lower of carrying value and fair value less costs to sell.
Non-current assets and disposal groups are classified as held for sale if their carrying amount will be recovered through a sale 
transaction rather than through continuing use. This condition is regarded as met only when the sale is highly probable and the asset 
(or disposal group) is available for immediate sale in its present condition. Management must be committed to the sale which should 
be expected to qualify for recognition as a completed sale within one year from the date of classification.
Inventory
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Cost comprises direct materials and expenses incurred in bringing 
the inventory to its present location and condition. Net realisable value represents the estimated selling price less marketing and 
distribution costs expected to be incurred. 
Foreign currencies
Transactions in currencies other than the entity’s functional currency are recorded at the rates of exchange prevailing on the dates of 
the transactions. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at the reporting date are retranslated at the rates 
ruling at that date. These translation differences are disclosed in the Income Statement.
Non-monetary items carried at fair value that are denominated in foreign currencies are translated at the rates prevailing at the date when 
the fair value was determined. Non-monetary items that are measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are not retranslated. 
Exchange differences arising on the retranslation of non-monetary items carried at fair value are included in the Income Statement for the 
period except for differences arising on the retranslation of non-monetary items in respect of which gains and losses are recognised directly 
in equity. For such non-monetary items, any exchange component of that gain or loss is also recognised directly in equity.
The statements of financial position of foreign subsidiaries are translated into pounds sterling at the closing rates of exchange. The results are 
translated at an average rate, recalculated for each month between that month’s closing rate and the equivalent for the preceding month.
Foreign exchange differences arising from the translation of opening net investments in foreign subsidiaries at the closing rate are 
taken directly to the hedging and translation reserve. In addition, foreign exchange differences arising from retranslation of the 
foreign subsidiaries’ results from monthly average rate to closing rate are also taken directly to the Group’s hedging and translation 
reserve. Such translation differences are recognised in the Income Statement in the financial year in which the operations are 
disposed of. The translation movement on matched long-term foreign currency borrowings, qualifying as hedging instruments under 
IAS 39, are also taken directly to the hedging and translation reserve.
Goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on the acquisition of a foreign entity are treated as assets and liabilities of the foreign 
entity and translated at the closing rate. 72

Leasing
Leases are classified as finance leases whenever the terms of the lease transfer substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership to 
the lessee. All other leases are classified as operating leases.
Assets held under finance leases and hire purchase contracts are capitalised at their fair value on the inception of the lease and 
depreciated over the shorter of the period of the lease and the estimated useful economic lives of the assets. The corresponding 
liability to the lessor is included in the Statement of Financial Position as a finance lease obligation. Finance charges are allocated 
over the period of the lease in proportion to the capital amount outstanding and are charged to the Income Statement. 
Operating lease rentals are charged to the Income Statement in equal annual amounts over the lease term.
Rental income from sub leasing property space is recognised on a straight line basis over the term of the relevant lease and is 
matched with the corresponding payments made under the head lease.
Taxation
The tax expense represents the sum of the current tax payable and deferred tax.
Current tax is based on taxable profit for the year. Taxable profit differs from net profit as reported in the Income Statement because it 
excludes items of income or expense that are taxable or deductible in other years and it further excludes items that are never taxable 
or deductible. The Group’s liability for current tax is calculated using tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the 
reporting date.
Deferred tax is the tax expected to be payable or recoverable on differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in 
the financial statements and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable profit, and is accounted for using the 
balance sheet liability method. Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised for all taxable temporary differences and deferred 
tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available against which deductible temporary 
differences can be utilised. Such assets and liabilities are not recognised if the temporary difference arises from goodwill or from the 
initial recognition (other than in a business combination) of other assets and liabilities in a transaction that affects neither the tax nor 
accounting profit. 
Deferred tax is calculated for all business combinations in respect of intangible assets and properties. A deferred tax liability is 
recognised to the extent that the fair value of the assets for accounting purposes exceeds the value of those assets for tax purposes 
and will form part of the associated goodwill on acquisition. 
Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for taxable temporary differences arising on investments in subsidiaries and associates except 
where the Group is able to control the reversal of the temporary difference and it is probable that the temporary difference will not 
reverse in the foreseeable future.
The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each reporting date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable 
that sufficient taxable profits will be available to allow all or part of the asset to be recovered.
Deferred tax is calculated at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period when the liability is settled or the asset is realised. 
Deferred tax is charged or credited in the Income Statement, except when it relates to items charged or credited directly to equity, in 
which case the deferred tax is also dealt with in equity.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to set off current tax assets against current tax 
liabilities and when they relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority and the Group intends to settle its current tax 
assets and liabilities on a net basis. 73 Informa plc Annual Report & Financial Statements for the year ended 31 December 2009
Pension costs
Certain Group companies operate defined contribution pension schemes for employees. The assets of the schemes are held 
separately from the individual companies. The pension cost charge associated with these schemes represents contributions payable 
and is charged as an expense when they fall due.
The Group also operates funded defined benefit schemes for employees. The cost of providing these benefits is determined using 
the Projected Unit Credit Method, with actuarial valuations being carried out at each reporting date. Past service cost is recognised 
immediately to the extent the benefits are vested, and otherwise are amortised on a straight line basis over the average period 
until the benefits become vested. The current service cost and the recognised element of any past service cost are presented within 
operating profit. The interest cost arising on the pension liability less the interest return on the scheme assets is presented within 
finance costs. Actuarial gains and losses are recognised in full in the period in which they occur, outside of the Income Statement and 
in the Statement of Comprehensive Income. The expected return on scheme assets reflects the estimate made by management of 
the long-term yields that will arise from the specific assets held within the pension scheme. 
The retirement benefit obligation recognised in the Statement of Financial Position represents the present value of the defined 
benefit obligation as adjusted for unrecognised past service cost and the fair value of any relevant scheme assets.
Payments to defined contribution retirement benefit schemes are charged as an expense as they fall due.
Share-based payments
The Group issues equity-settled share-based payments to certain employees. A fair value for the equity-settled share awards is 
measured at the date of grant. The fair value of the Share Options and Long-Term Incentive Plan is measured using the Binomial or 
Monte Carlo model of valuation, which are considered to be the most appropriate valuation techniques. The valuation takes into 
account factors such as non-transferability, exercise restrictions and behavioural considerations. To assign a fair value to share awards 
granted under the Share Matching Plan where the proportion of the award released is dependent on the level of total shareholder 
return, the Monte Carlo Simulation methodology is considered the most appropriate.
An expense is recognised to spread the fair value of each award over the vesting period on a straight line basis, after allowing for an 
estimate of the share awards that will actually vest. The estimate of vesting is reviewed annually, with any impact on the cumulative 
charge being recognised immediately.
Financial assets
Financial assets are recognised in the Group’s Statement of Financial Position when the Group becomes a party to the contractual provisions of 
the instrument.
Financial assets are classified into the following categories: loans and receivables, cash and cash equivalents, and available-for-sale 
investments. The classification is determined by Management upon initial recognition, and it is based on the purpose for which the 
financial assets were acquired.
Effective interest method
The effective interest method is a method of calculating the amortised cost of a financial asset and of allocating interest income over the 
relevant period. The effective interest rate is the rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash receipts (including all fees on points paid or 
received that form an integral part of the effective interest rate, transaction costs and other premiums or discounts) through the expected life 
of the financial asset, or, where appropriate, a shorter period.
Income is recognised on an effective interest basis for all debt instruments within the Group.  
Loans and receivables
Trade receivables, loans and other receivables are measured on initial recognition at fair value, and are subsequently measured at amortised 
cost using the effective interest rate method, less any impairment. 
Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash on hand and demand deposits, and other short-term highly liquid investments that are 
readily convertible (with a maturity of three months or less) to a known amount of cash and are subject to an insignificant risk of 
changes in value. Bank overdrafts that are repayable on demand and form an integral part of the Group’s cash management are 
included as a component of cash and cash equivalents for the purpose of the Cash Flow Statement. 74

3 Accounting policies continued
Available-for-sale investments
Listed and unlisted shares held by the Group that are traded in an active market are classified as being available-for-sale and are 
stated at fair value. Fair value of listed securities are based on quoted market prices and the unlisted securities are based on cost. 
Gains or losses arising from changes in fair value are recognised directly in equity, until the security is disposed of or is determined 
to be impaired, at which time the cumulative gain or loss previously recognised in equity is included in the Income Statement for the 
period. Where the investment is disposed of or is determined to be impaired, the cumulative gain or loss previously recognised in the 
investments revaluation reserve is included in profit or loss for the period.
Impairment of financial assets
Financial assets are assessed for indicators of impairment at each reporting date. Financial assets are impaired where there is 
objective evidence that, as a result of one or more events that occurred after the initial recognition of the financial asset, the 
estimated future cash flows of the investment have been negatively impacted.
For unlisted shares classified as available-for-sale, a significant or prolonged decline in the fair value of the security below its cost is 
considered to be objective evidence of impairment.
For all other financial assets objective evidence of impairment could include:
significant financial difficulty of the issuer or counterparty; or •	
default or delinquency in interest or principal payments; or •	
it is becoming probable that the borrower will enter bankruptcy or financial re-organisation. •	
For certain categories of financial assets, such as trade receivables, assets that are assessed not to be impaired individually are 
subsequently assessed for impairment on a collective basis. Objective evidence of impairment for a portfolio of receivables could 
include the Group’s past experience of collecting payments, an increase in the number of delayed payments in the portfolio past the 
average credit period of 39 days (2008: 38 days), as well as observable changes in national or local economic conditions that correlate 
with default on receivables. A specific provision will also be raised for trade receivables when there is objective evidence that the 
Group will not be able to collect all amounts due according to the original terms of the receivables. Significant financial difficulties 
of the debtor, probability that the debtor will enter bankruptcy or financial reorganisation, and default or delinquency in payments 
(more than 90 days overdue) are considered indicators that the trade receivable is impaired.
For financial assets carried at amortised cost, the amount of the impairment is the difference between the asset’s carrying amount 
and the present value of estimated future cash flows, discounted at the financial asset’s original effective interest rate.
The carrying amount of the financial asset is reduced by the impairment loss directly for all financial assets with the exception of trade 
receivables, where the carrying amount is reduced through the use of a provision account. When a trade receivable is considered 
uncollectible, it is written off against the provision account. Subsequent recoveries of amounts previously written off are credited 
against the provision account. Changes in the carrying amount of the provision account are recognised in the Income Statement.
Derecognition of financial assets
The Group derecognises a financial asset only when the contractual rights to the cash flows from the assets have expired or have 
been transferred and the Group has transferred substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership.  If the Group neither transfers nor 
retains substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership and continues to control the transferred asset, the Group recognises its 
retained interest in the asset and an associated liability for amounts it may have to pay. If the Group retains substantially all the risks 
and rewards of ownership of a transferred financial asset, the Group continues to recognise the financial asset and also recognises a 
collateralised borrowing for the proceeds received. 75 Informa plc Annual Report & Financial Statements for the year ended 31 December 2009
Financial liabilities and equity instruments issued by the Group
Financial liabilities and equity instruments are classified according to the substance of the contractual arrangements entered into.  
An equity instrument is any contract that evidences a residual interest in the assets of the Group after deducting all of its liabilities.
Classification as debt or equity
Debt and equity instruments are classified as either financial liabilities or as equity in accordance with the substance of the 
contractual arrangement.
Equity instruments
An equity instrument is any contract that evidences a residual interest in the assets of an entity after deducting all of its liabilities. 
Equity instruments issued by the Group are recorded at the proceeds received, net of direct issue costs.
Financial guarantee contract liabilities
Financial guarantee contract liabilities are measured at the amount of the obligation under the contract, as determined in 
accordance with IAS 37 Provisions, Contingent Liabilities and Contingent Assets.
Bank borrowings
Interest-bearing bank loans and overdrafts are recorded at the proceeds received, net of direct issue costs. Finance charges, 
including premiums payable on settlement or redemption and direct issue costs, are accounted for on an accrual basis in the Income 
Statement using the effective interest rate method and are added to the carrying amount of the instrument to the extent that they 
are not settled in the period in which they arise.
Finance costs 
Finance costs of debts are capitalised against the debt value on first drawdown of the debt and are recognised in the Income 
Statement using the effective interest rate method. 
Trade payables
Trade payables are initially measured at fair value, and are subsequently measured at amortised cost, using the effective interest rate method.
Other financial liabilities
Other financial liabilities are initially measured at fair value, net of transaction costs. Other financial liabilities are subsequently 
measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method, with interest expense recognised on an effective yield basis.
The effective interest method is a method of calculating the amortised cost of a financial liability and of allocating interest expense 
over the relevant period. The effective interest rate is the rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash payments through the 
expected life of the financial liability, or, where appropriate, a shorter period.
Derecognition of financial liabilities
The Group derecognises financial liabilities when, and only when, the Group’s obligations are discharged, cancelled or they expire.
Derivative financial instruments and hedge accounting
The Group’s activities expose it primarily to the financial risks of changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates.  
The derivative instruments utilised by the Group to hedge these exposures are primarily interest rate swaps. The Group does not use 
derivative contracts for speculative purposes.
Derivatives are initially recognised at fair value at the date a derivative contract is entered into and are subsequently remeasured to their 
fair value at each reporting date. The method of recognising the resulting gain or loss depends on whether the derivative is designated 
as a hedging instrument, and if so, the nature of the item being hedged. The Group designates certain derivatives as either:
hedges of a particular risk associated with a recognised asset or liability or a highly probable forecast transaction (cash flow hedge); or •	
hedges of a net investment in a foreign operation (net investment hedge). •	 76

3 Accounting policies continued
The Group documents at the inception of the transaction the relationship between hedging instruments and hedged items, as well as its 
risk management objectives and strategy for undertaking various hedging transactions. Furthermore, at the inception of the hedge and 
on an ongoing basis, the Group documents whether the hedging instrument that is used in a hedging relationship is highly effective in 
offsetting changes in fair values or cash flows of the hedged item.
Changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments that are designated and effective as hedges of future cash flows are recognised 
directly in equity and the ineffective portion is recognised immediately in the Income Statement. If the cash flow hedge of a firm 
commitment or forecast transaction results in the recognition of an asset or a liability, then, at the time the asset or liability is recognised, 
the associated gains or losses on the derivative that had previously been recognised in equity are included in the initial measurement of the 
asset or liability. For hedges that do not result in the recognition of an asset or a liability, amounts deferred in equity are recognised in the 
Income Statement in the same period in which the hedged item affects net profit or loss.
Changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments that do not qualify for hedge accounting are recognised in the Income 
Statement as they arise.
Amounts payable or receivable in respect of interest rate swaps are recognised as adjustments to interest expense over the period  
of the contracts.
Hedge accounting is discontinued when the hedge instrument expires or is sold, terminated, or exercised, or no longer qualifies for  
hedge accounting. At that time, any cumulative gain or loss on the hedging instrument recognised in equity is retained in equity until  
the forecast transaction occurs. If a hedged transaction is no longer expected to occur, the net cumulative gain or loss recognised in  
equity is transferred to the Income Statement for the period.
A derivative is presented as a non-current asset or a non-current liability if the remaining maturity of the instrument is more than 12 months 
and it is not expected to be realised or settled within 12 months. Other derivatives are presented as current assets or current liabilities.
Further details of derivative financial instruments are disclosed in Note 24.
ESOP Trust shares
Own shares deducted in arriving at shareholders’ funds represent the cost of the Company’s ordinary shares acquired by the 
Employee Share Option Plan (ESOP) trusts in connection with certain of the Group’s employee share schemes.
Provisions
Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present obligation as a result of a past event, and it is probable that the Group will 
be required to settle that obligation. Provisions are measured at the Directors’ best estimate of the expenditure required to settle the 
obligation at the reporting date, and are discounted to present value where the effect is material.
Restructuring provisions are recognised when the Group has a detailed formal plan for the restructuring that has been 
communicated to the affected parties.
4 c ritical accounting judgments and key sources of estimation uncertainty
In the application of the Group’s accounting policies, which are described in Note 3, the Directors are required to make judgments, 
estimates and assumptions about the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. The 
estimates and associated assumptions are based on historical experience and other factors that are considered to be relevant. Actual 
results may differ from these estimates.
The estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in 
the period in which the estimate is revised if the revision affects only that period, or in the period of the revision and future periods if 
the revision affects both current and future periods.
In addition to the judgment taken by management in selecting and applying the accounting policies set out above, the Directors 
have made the following judgments concerning the amounts recognised in the consolidated financial statements. 77 Informa plc Annual Report & Financial Statements for the year ended 31 December 2009
Valuation and asset lives of separately identifiable intangible assets
In order to determine the value of the separately identifiable intangible assets on the acquisition of a business combination, 
management are required to make estimates when utilising the Group’s valuation methodologies. These methodologies include  
the use of discounted cash flows, revenue and gross profit multiples. Asset lives are estimated based on the nature of the intangible 
asset acquired and range between 3 and 40 years.
Valuation of share-based payments
In order to determine the value of share-based payments, management are required to make an estimation of the effects of  
non-transferability, exercise restrictions, and behavioural considerations. The expected volatility is determined by calculating the 
historical volatility of the Company’s share price calculated over one, two and three years back from the date of grant. The list of 
inputs used in the Binomial and Monte Carlo Simulation models to calculate the fair values are provided in Note 37.
Valuation of financial instruments at fair value
Management have made a number of assumptions with regards to the models used to value financial instruments at their fair value 
at year end. Valuation techniques commonly used by market practitioners are applied. Note 24 details the methods used to value the 
primary financial instruments held or issued to finance the Group’s borrowing requirements and the derivative financial instruments 
held to manage the interest rate profile.
For derivative financial instruments, assumptions are made based on quoted market rates adjusted for specific features of the 
instrument. Other financial instruments are valued using a discounted cash flow analysis based on assumptions supported, where 
possible, by observable market prices or rates. 
Impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets
There are a number of assumptions management have considered in performing impairment reviews of goodwill and intangible 
assets, as determining whether goodwill or intangible assets are impaired requires an estimation of the value in use of the cash 
generating units to which goodwill has been allocated. The value in use calculation requires the directors to estimate the future cash 
flows expected to arise from the cash generating unit and a suitable discount rate in order to calculate present value. Note 15 details 
the assumptions that have been applied.
Pension assumptions
There are a number of assumptions management have considered on the advice of actuaries which have an impact on the results of 
the valuation of the pension scheme liabilities at year end. The most significant assumptions are those relating to the discount rate of 
return on investments and the rates of increase in salaries and pensions. Note 36 details the assumptions which have been adopted.
Deferred tax
Deferred tax assets and liabilities require management judgment in determining the amounts to be recognised. In particular, 
judgment is used when assessing the extent to which deferred tax assets should be recognised with consideration given to the 
timing and level of future taxable income.
Provisions
Provisions have been made for onerous leases, dilapidations and restructuring. These provisions are estimates and the actual costs 
and timing of future cash flows are dependent on future events. Any difference between expectations and the actual future liability 
will be accounted for in the period when such determination is made. Details of the Group’s provisions are set out in Note 28.
Contingent consideration
Contingent consideration relating to acquisitions has been included based on management estimates of the most likely 
outcome (Note 28). 78

Business segments
Management has identified reportable segments based on financial information used by the Board of Directors in allocating 
resources and making strategic decisions. 
In prior years, externally reported segment information was based on the markets being served rather than the services 
being provided.
Information currently reported to the Board for the purposes of managing performance is now focused on the different services the 
Group offers, namely publishing, and training and events.
The Group’s five newly identified reportable segments under IFRS 8 are therefore as follows:
Academic Information (AI)
This division, which includes the Taylor & Francis publishing business, provides a portfolio of online and print publications, primarily 
for academic users across the spectrum of Science, Technology, Humanities and Social Sciences. 
Professional and Commercial Information (PCI)
This division, which includes Datamonitor, Informa Business Information and Informa Financial Information provides information, 
across a range of formats and on a global basis, to a variety of sectors including Medical, Pharmaceutical, Financial, Law, Commerce, 
Commodities, Maritime and Telecoms.
Events and Training – Europe, US and ROW
These three divisions provide events and training to Europe, US and Rest of the World (ROW). 
Information regarding the Group’s reportable segments is reported below and has been prepared consistently with the Group’s 
accounting policies. Amounts reported for the prior year have been restated in accordance with the requirements of IFRS 8. 79 Informa plc Annual Report & Financial Statements for the year ended 31 December 2009

The accounting policies of the reportable segments are the same as the Group’s accounting policies described in Note 3. Adjusted 
operating result by segment is the measure reported to the Group’s Chief Executive for the purpose of resource allocation and 
assessment of segment performance. Unallocated costs of £6.4m (2008: £0.6m) relate to the aborted transaction costs and change of 
domicile – refer to Note 8. Finance costs and investment income are not allocated to segments, as this type of activity is driven by the 
central treasury function, which manages the cash positions of the Group. 80

Pursuant to the Dividend Access Plan (DAP) arrangements put in place as part of the Scheme of Arrangement, shareholders in the 
Company are able to elect to receive their dividends from a UK source (a DAP election). Shareholders who (i) held 100,000 or fewer 
shares on the date of admission of the Company’s shares to the London Stock Exchange and (ii) in the case of shareholders who did 
not own the shares at that time, on the first dividend record date after they become shareholders in the Company, unless they elect 
otherwise, are deemed to have elected to receive their dividends under the DAP arrangements. Shareholders who hold more than 
100,000 shares and who wish to receive their dividends from a UK source must make a DAP election. All elections remain in force 
indefinitely unless revoked. Unless shareholders have made a DAP election, or are deemed to have made a DAP election, dividends 
will be received directly from the Company, domiciled in Switzerland, and will be taxed accordingly. 87 Informa plc Annual Report & Financial Statements for the year ended 31 December 2009

Basic
The basic earnings per share calculation is based on a profit attributable to equity shareholders of the parent of £105.6m  
(2008: £84.9m). This profit on ordinary activities after taxation is divided by the weighted average number of shares in issue  
(less those non-vested shares held by employee share ownership trusts) which is 560,764,541 (2008: 505,049,586 restated).
Diluted
The diluted earnings per share calculation is based on the basic earnings per share calculation above except that the weighted 
average number of shares includes all potentially dilutive options granted by the reporting date as if those options had been 
exercised on the first day of the accounting period or the date of the grant, if later, giving a weighted average of 560,843,788  
(2008: 505,358,233 restated). 
The table below sets out the adjustment in respect of diluted potential ordinary shares:

Goodwill acquired in a business combination is allocated, at acquisition, to the cash generating units (CGUs) that are expected to 
benefit from that business combination. 
The carrying amount of goodwill recorded in the major groups of cash generating units is set out below:
2009

AI 406.9 425.9
PCI 692.5 717.0
Events Europe 344.8 363.1
Events US 225.4 248.0
Events ROW 57.7 56.5
 1,727.3 1,810.5
The Group tests goodwill annually for impairment or more frequently if there are indications that goodwill might be impaired. 
The recoverable amounts of the CGUs are determined from value in use calculations. The key assumptions for the value in use 
calculations are those regarding the discount rates and growth rates for the period. Management estimates discount rates 
using pre-tax rates that reflect current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the CGUs. The 
growth rates are based on industry growth forecasts and long-term growth in gross domestic product. The Group has changed 
its method of calculating the value in use from estimating cash flows over 25 years to a terminal value calculation. 89 Informa plc Annual Report & Financial Statements for the year ended 31 December 2009
The Group prepares cash flow forecasts derived from the most recent financial budgets approved by the Board of Directors for the 
next year and extrapolates cash flows for the following four years based on an estimated growth rates. The estimates of future cash 
flows are consistent with past experience adjusted for management’s estimates of future performance. The cash flows thereafter are 
based upon the long-term historic growth rates of the underlying territories in which the CGU operates. 
The pre-tax discount rates applied are 9.5% for AI and PCI and 10.5% for the Events businesses. These rates have increased this year 
reflecting the risk premium associated with each CGU. A growth rate of 3% has been applied for years 2-5 in AI and PCI and a range 
between 2% and 15% for the Events businesses. The rates do not exceed the average long-term growth rate for the relevant markets.
The terminal growth rate of 2% has been used for AI and PCI, and 3% for the Events businesses. The only change from last year is the 
increase by 1% point for the Events businesses. This is consistent with appropriate external sources for the relevant markets.
The most recent financial budgets approved by the Board of Directors have been prepared after considering the most recent 
economic environment which has resulted in more conservative estimates about the future. 
At 31 December 2009 and 31 December 2008, the carrying amounts of goodwill for CGUs were tested for impairment and deemed 
not to be impaired. The carrying amounts were calculated based on future projected cash flows discounted at rates as disclosed 
above, which represented the Group’s weighted average cost of capital plus a premium for risk. 
Management has undertaken sensitivity analysis taking into consideration the impact on key impairment test assumptions arising 
from a range of possible future trading and economic scenarios. The scenarios have been performed separately for each CGU with 
the sensitivities summarised as follows:
An increase in the pre-tax discount rate by 1%. •	
A decrease of between 1% and 5.5% (depending on the CGU) on forecast operating profits over the next 5 years, and a decrease •	
in the terminal growth rate by 1% for all CGUs in the Events businesses.
The sensitivity analysis shows that no impairment would result from an increase in the pre-tax discount rate. An impairment of 
between £0.5 million and £7.3 million would result from sensitivities applied to the growth rates. 
Those CGUs which had the lowest level of headroom or potential impairment in this analysis related to the Events businesses, 
which predominantly concentrate on the Financial Services sector. If the economic environment surrounding this sector continues 
to decline throughout 2010, the effect of which would erode the customer base further, there may be the possibility of a future 
impairment. Management will conduct regular reviews to monitor this.  90

At 31 December 2009, the Group has unused tax losses of £11.5m (2008: £11.5m) available for offset against future profits. A deferred 
tax asset of £3.2m (2008: £3.2m), has been recognised in respect of these losses.
At the reporting date, the aggregate amount of post acquisition undistributed earnings for which deferred tax liabilities have not 
been recognised was £3.1m (2008: £512.2m). The deferred tax liability has significantly reduced, principally because of changes to 
the legislation concerning the tax treatment of overseas dividends in the United Kingdom. The majority of the deferred tax liability 
represents withholding tax payable on dividends. No liability has been recognised because the Group, being in a position to control 
the timing of the distribution of intra group dividends, has no intention to distribute intra group dividends in the foreseeable future 
that would trigger withholding tax. 95 Informa plc Annual Report & Financial Statements for the year ended 31 December 2009

24 Financial instruments
(a) Financial risk management
The Group has exposure to the following risks from its use of financial instruments:
Capital risk management •	
Market risk •	
Credit risk •	
Liquidity risk •	
This note presents information about the Group’s exposure to each of the above risks, the Group’s management of capital, and the 
Group’s objectives, policies and procedures for measuring and managing risk.  
The Board of Directors has overall responsibility for the establishment and oversight of the Group’s risk management framework. 
The Board has established a Treasury Committee which is responsible for developing and monitoring the Group’s risk management 
policies. The committee meets and reports regularly to the Board of Directors and the Risk Committee (a sub-Committee of the Audit 
Committee) on its activities.
The Group treasury function provides services to the Group’s businesses, co-ordinates access to domestic and international financial 
markets and monitors and manages the financial risks relating to the operations of the Group through internal risk reports which 
analyse exposures by degree and magnitude of risks. These risks include market risk (including currency risk, fair value interest rate 
risk and price risk), credit risk, liquidity risk and cash flow interest rate risk.
The Treasury Committee has put in place policies that have been established to identify and analyse risks faced by the Group, to set 
appropriate risk limits and controls and to monitor risks and adherence to limits. These policies provide written principles on funding 
and investment policies, credit risk, foreign exchange risk and interest rate risk. Compliance with policies and exposure limits is 
reviewed by the Treasury Committee. This committee is assisted in its oversight role by Internal Audit, who undertakes both regular 
and ad hoc reviews of risk management controls and procedures, the results of which are reported to the Audit Committee.  
Capital risk management 
The Group manages its capital to ensure that entities in the Group will be able to continue as a going concern while maximising 
the return to stakeholders as well as sustaining the future development of the business. In order to maintain or adjust the capital 
structure, the Group may adjust the amount of dividends paid to shareholders, return capital to shareholders, issue new shares or sell 
assets to reduce debt. The Group’s overall strategy remains unchanged from 2008.
The capital structure of the Group consists of debt, which includes the borrowings (Note 23), cash and cash equivalents (Note 20) and 
equity attributable to equity holders of the parent, comprising issued capital (Note 25), reserves and retained earnings.
Gearing ratio
The Group’s Treasury Committee reviews the capital structure on a quarterly basis and as part of this review, the committee considers 
the cost of capital and the risks associated with each class of capital.
Consistent with others in the industry, the Group monitors capital on the basis of the gearing ratio. This ratio is calculated as the net 
debt divided by total capital. Net debt is calculated as total borrowings (including current and non-current borrowings) less cash and 
cash equivalents. Total capital is calculated as equity (including capital, reserves and retained earnings).  97 Informa plc Annual Report & Financial Statements for the year ended 31 December 2009
(b) Categories of Financial instruments
Details of the significant accounting policies and methods adopted, including the criteria for recognition, the basis of measurement 
and the basis on which income and expenses are recognised in respect of each class of financial asset, financial liability and equity 
instrument are disclosed in Note 3 to the financial statements.

(c) Market risk
Market risk is the risk that changes in the market prices, such as foreign exchange rates and interest rates, will affect the Group’s 
income or the value of its holdings of financial instruments. The objective of market risk management is to manage and control 
market risk exposures within acceptable parameters, while optimising the return on risk.
The Group’s activities expose it mainly to the financial risks of changes in foreign currency exchange rates and changes in interest 
rates. The Group enters into interest rate swaps to mitigate the risk of rising interest rates and by managing the risk of currencies of 
its borrowings, the Group is able to achieve a level of natural hedge of both the Statement of Financial Position net currency assets 
and also the currency earnings due to the currency interest payable. Refer to both interest rate risk and foreign currency risk in Note 
24 (d) and (e) respectively.  
The Group does not use derivative contracts for speculative purposes.
The Group’s overall risk management programme focuses on the unpredictability of financial markets and seeks to minimise 
potential adverse effects on the Group’s financial performance. Risk management is carried out by a central treasury department 
(Group treasury) under policies approved by the Board of Directors. The Board sets the Group’s treasury policy to ensure that it has 
adequate financial resources to develop the Group’s businesses and to manage the currency and interest risks to which the Group is 
exposed. Group treasury monitors the distribution of its cash assets, borrowings and facilities so as to control exposure to the relative 
performance of any particular territory, currency or institution.
The Board and the Treasury Committee provides written principles for overall risk management, as well as policies covering specific 
areas, such as funding, foreign exchange risk, interest rate risk, credit risk and investments of excess liquidity. 
Risk is measured in terms of impact, inherent risk and residual risk, and takes account of management’s control actions in mitigating 
against both external and internal risk events.
The risk model consolidates unique risk events and aggregated risk categories at both a business unit level and Group-wide, and 
the results are presented to the Risk Committee and the Audit Committee for discussion and review, and may drive the allocation of 
Internal Audit (previously known as Group Internal Control) resources to provide assurance on significant risks in its annual plan.
(d) Interest rate risk
The Group has no significant interest-bearing assets and is exposed to interest rate risk as entities in the Group borrow funds at both 
fixed and floating interest rates. Borrowings issued at variable rates expose the Group to cash flow interest rate risk. Borrowings 
issued at fixed rates expose the Group to fair value interest rate risk. 
The risk is managed by the Group by maintaining an appropriate mix between fixed and floating rate borrowings by the use of 
interest rate swap contracts. Hedging activities are evaluated regularly to align with interest rate views and defined risk appetite, 
ensuring optimal hedging strategies are applied, by either protecting the Statement of Financial Position or protecting interest 
expense through different interest rate cycles.
The Group policy is to minimise its exposure to fluctuations in interest rates by using interest rate swaps as cash flow hedges to 
hedge up to 90% of forecast interest payments over a period of up to five years, based on forecast net debt levels by currency during 
that period. This policy provides a level of certainty of future interest costs by swapping floating to fixed interest payments which in 
turn assists the predictability of achieving interest-based loan covenants.
The Group’s exposures to interest rates on financial assets and financial liabilities are detailed in the liquidity risk section of this note.
Interest rate swap contracts
The Group draws down on its borrowing facilities at floating rates of interest. A portion of those are then swapped to fixed rates in 
line with the Group treasury policy in order to manage its cash flow interest rate risk. Such contracts enable the Group to convert 
borrowings from floating rates and swap them into fixed rates. Under interest rate swaps, the Group agrees with other parties to 
exchange, at specified intervals (primarily quarterly), the difference between fixed contract rates and floating-rate interest amounts 
calculated by reference to the agreed notional amounts.  99 Informa plc Annual Report & Financial Statements for the year ended 31 December 2009
The fair value of interest rate swaps at the reporting date is determined by discounting the future cash flows using the future interest 
rate curves at the reporting date and the credit risk inherent in the contract, and is disclosed below. The average interest rate is based 
on the outstanding balance at the end of the financial year. 
The following table details the notional principal amounts and remaining terms of interest rate swap contracts outstanding as at the

Interest rate sensitivity analysis
A high percentage of loans are designated in hedging relationships, and hence the Group’s interest rate sensitivity would only be 
effected by the exposure to variable rate debt.
If interest rates had been 100 basis points higher or lower and all other variables were held constant, the Group’s profit for the year 
would decrease or increase by £2.4m (2008: £3.4m). 100

(e) Foreign currency risk
The Group is a business with significant net US Dollar (USD) and net Euro (EUR) transactions; hence exposures to exchange rate 
fluctuations arise. Without action in conversion of USD and other trading currencies, such as the EUR, cash positions in these 
currencies would develop imbalances by growing GBP debt. 
Allied to the Group’s policy on the hedging of surplus foreign currency cash inflows, the Group will usually seek to finance its net 
investment in its principal overseas subsidiaries by borrowing in those subsidiaries’ functional currencies, primarily EUR and USD. This 
policy has the effect of protecting the Group’s consolidated Statement of Financial Position from movements in those currencies to 
the extent that the associated net assets are hedged by the net foreign currency borrowings.
After taking into account foreign currency borrowings of £526.0m (2008: £730.4m) used to hedge against net investments in 
foreign subsidiaries, the remaining monetary assets and liabilities are in the same currency as the functional currency of the 
operations involved. 
The following significant exchange rates versus GBP applied during the year:
Average rate Closing rate
2009 2008 2009 2008
USD 1.5566 1.8637 1.6114 1.4602
EUR 1.1196 1.2627 1.1180 1.0465
Foreign currency sensitivity analysis
The Group receives approximately 45% of its revenues and incurs approximately 41% of its costs in USD or currencies pegged to USD. 
The Group is therefore sensitive to movements in the USD against the GBP . Each 1 cent movement in the USD to GBP exchange rate 
has a circa £3.5m impact on revenue and a circa £1.1m impact on operating profits. Offsetting this will be reductions to USD interest 
and US tax liabilities. This analysis assumes all other variables, including interest rates, remain constant.
The Group receives approximately 9% of its revenues and incurs approximately 10% of its costs in Euros. The Group is therefore 
sensitive to movements in the Euro against the GBP . Each 1 cent movement in the Euro to GBP exchange rate has a circa £1.0m 
impact on revenue and a circa £0.2m impact on operating profits. Offsetting this will be reductions to Euro interest and Euro tax 
liabilities. This analysis assumes all other variables, including interest rates, remain constant. 101 Informa plc Annual Report & Financial Statements for the year ended 31 December 2009
(f) Credit risk
The Group’s principal financial assets are loans and receivables, cash and cash equivalents and trade and other receivables, which 
represent the Group’s maximum exposure to credit risk in relation to financial assets.
The Group’s credit risk is primarily attributable to its trade and other receivables. The amounts presented in the Statement of 
Financial Position are net of allowances for doubtful receivables, estimated by the Group’s management based on prior experience 
and their assessment of the current economic environment.
Credit risk refers to the risk that a counterparty will default on its contractual obligations resulting in financial loss to the Group. 
The Group has adopted a policy of only dealing with creditworthy counterparties as a means of mitigating the risk of financial loss 
from defaults. 
The credit risk on liquid funds and derivative financial instruments is limited because the counterparties are banks with high credit-
ratings assigned by international credit-rating agencies such as Standard and Poor’s, Moody’s and Fitch. No new credit exposure on 
derivative financial instruments is permitted to a financial institution with a rating lower then A+ or equivalent. The Group’s exposure 
and the credit ratings of its counterparties are continuously monitored and the aggregate value of transactions concluded is spread 
amongst approved financial institutions. Credit exposure is controlled by counterparty limits that are reviewed and approved by the 
Treasury Committee at least annually.
The carrying amount of financial assets recorded in the financial statements, which is net of impairment losses, represents the 
Group’s maximum exposure to credit risk. 
Trade receivables
Trade receivables consist of a large number of customers, spread across diverse industries and geographical areas and the Group’s 
exposure to credit risk is influenced mainly by the individual characteristics of each customer. The demographics of the Group’s 
customer base, including default risk of the industry and country in which the customers operate, has less of an influence on 
credit risk.
The Group does not have any significant credit risk exposure to any single counterparty or any group of counterparties having similar 
characteristics. The Group defines counterparties as having similar characteristics if they are related entities. Concentration of credit 
risk did not exceed 5% of gross monetary assets at any time during the year. 
The Group establishes a provision that represents its estimate of incurred losses in respect of trade and other receivables and investments 
when there is objective evidence that the asset is impaired. The main components of this provision are a specific loss component that relates to 
individually significant exposures, and a collective loss component established for groups of similar assets in respect of losses that have been 
incurred but not yet identified. The collective loss provision is determined by references to past default experience. 
Before accepting any new customer, the Group uses an external credit rating system to assess the potential customer’s credit quality.  
All customers have credit limits set by credit managers and are subject to standard terms of payment for each division. As the events division 
works on a prepaid basis they are not subject to the same credit controls and they have a very low bad debt history. The Group is exposed to 
normal credit risk and potential losses are mitigated as the Group does not have significant exposure to any single customer.
The Directors consider that the carrying amount of trade and other receivables, which are non-interest bearing, approximates their fair value.  102

Trade receivables that are less than three months past due for payment are generally not considered impaired. Included in the 
past due greater than 120 days, is a provision relating to returns on books of £9.3m (2008: £9.5m). This provision is based on 
Management’s best estimate of previous seasonal sales and returns trends, and is included as part of the overall impairment 
balance. Included in the Group’s trade receivables, are debtors with a carrying amount of £9.0m (2008: £9.7m), which are past due 
at the reporting date for which the Group has not provided, as there has not been a significant change in the credit quality and the 
amounts are considered recoverable. The Group does not hold any collateral over these balances.

In determining the recoverability of a trade receivable, the Group considers any change in the credit quality of the trade receivable from 
the date credit was initially granted up to the reporting date. The concentration of credit risk is limited due to the customer base being 
large and unrelated. Accordingly, the directors believe that there is no further credit provision required in excess of the above amount.
There are no customers who represent more than 10% of the total balance of trade receivables in both 2009 and 2008. 103 Informa plc Annual Report & Financial Statements for the year ended 31 December 2009
(g) Liquidity risk
Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group will not be able to meet its financial obligations as they fall due. Ultimate responsibility for 
liquidity risk management rests with the Board of Directors, though operationally it is managed by Group Treasury. They have built 
an appropriate liquidity risk management framework for the management of the Group’s short, medium and long-term funding 
and liquidity management requirements. The Group manages liquidity risk by maintaining adequate reserves, banking facilities 
and reserve borrowing facilities, by continuously monitoring forecast and actual cash flows and matching the maturity profiles of 
financial assets and liabilities. Included in Note 23 is a summary of additional undrawn facilities that the Group has at its disposal to 
further reduce liquidity risk. 
Historically and for the foreseeable future the Group has been and is expected to continue to be in a net borrowing position. The 
Group’s policy is to fulfil its borrowing requirements by borrowing in the currencies in which it operates, principally GBP , USD and 
EUR; thereby providing a natural hedge against projected future surplus USD and EUR cash inflows as well as spreading the Group’s 
interest rate profile across a number of currencies. 
Liquidity and interest risk tables
The following tables detail the Group’s remaining contractual maturity for its financial assets and liabilities.

The Group draws down on its borrowing facilities at floating rates of interest. A portion of those are then swapped to fixed rates in 
line with the Group Treasury policy. The first portion of these swaps that matures within twelve months is £144.4m (2008: £313.2m), 
the second portion that matures in a period greater than one year but less than two years is £397.2m (2008: £202.4m) and the final 
portion that matures between two and five years is £112.0m (2008: £495.8m). 
(h) Fair value of financial instruments
The fair value is defined as the amount at which a financial instrument could be exchanged in an arm’s length transaction between 
informed and willing parties and is calculated by reference to market rates discounted to current value. 
The fair values of financial assets and financial liabilities are determined as follows:
the fair value of financial assets and financial liabilities with standard terms and conditions and traded on active liquid markets is •	
determined with reference to quoted market prices;
the fair value of other financial assets and financial liabilities (excluding derivative instruments) is determined in accordance •	
with generally accepted pricing models based on discounted cash flow analysis using prices from observable current market 
transactions and dealer quotes for similar instruments;
the fair value of derivative instruments is calculated using quoted prices. Where such prices are not available, use is made of •	
discounted cash flow analysis using the applicable yield curve for the duration of the instruments for non-optional derivatives, 
and option pricing models for optional derivatives; and
the fair value of financial guarantee contracts is determined using option pricing models where the main assumptions are the •	
probability of default by the specified counterparty extrapolated from market-based credit information and the amount of loss, 
given the default. 105 Informa plc Annual Report & Financial Statements for the year ended 31 December 2009
The Directors consider that the carrying amounts of financial assets and financial liabilities recorded at amortised cost in the financial 
statements approximate to their fair values due to the short maturity of the instruments or because they bear interest at rates 
approximate to the market.

(i) Fair value measurements recognised in the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position
The following table provides an analysis of financial instruments that are measured subsequent to initial recognition at fair value, 
grouped into Levels 1 to 3 based on the degree to which the fair value is observable.
Level 1 fair value measurements are those derived from quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or •	
liabilities.
Level 2 fair value measurements are those derived from inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are •	
observable for the asset or liability, either directly (i.e. as prices) or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices).
Level 3 fair value measurements are those derived from valuation techniques that include inputs for the asset or liability that are •	
not based on observable market data (unobservable inputs).

25 s hare capital
The Company was incorporated under the Companies (Jersey) Law 1991 on 11 March 2009, as a public company limited by shares 
with the name Informa Limited and changed its name on 29 April 2009 to Informa plc. The Company became the parent company of 
the Informa Group and the existing parent company, then also named Informa plc, was renamed Informa Group plc.
The Company was incorporated on 11 March 2009 with an authorised share capital of £1,000,000 divided into 1,000,000,000 ordinary 
shares of 0.1 pence each. Of such shares, twenty ordinary shares were taken by the subscribers to the memorandum of association 
and were paid up in full in cash. 
On 21 April 2009 the authorised share capital was increased to 150,000,012,000 unissued ordinary shares of 0.1 pence each and 
consolidated into 555,555,600 ordinary shares of 27 pence each.
On 27 April 2009 the total authorised share capital was then increased to £202,500,000 divided into 750,000,000 shares of 27 pence each. 
On 27 May 2009 the Group undertook a 2 for 5 rights issue, offering 170,096,930 new ordinary shares at 150 pence per share, 
representing a bonus to existing shareholders of 0.1887 ordinary shares per ordinary share held. The rights issue raised £242.5m, 
net of expenses of £12.5m. The issue price of 150 pence per new ordinary share represented a 48.9 per cent discount to the closing 
middle market price of 297.25 pence per ordinary share on 30 April 2009 (being the last business day before the announcement of 
the rights issue), adjusted for the final dividend for 2008 which was not paid on the new ordinary shares, and a 40.6 per cent discount 
to the theoretical ex-rights price based on that closing price, also adjusted for that dividend.
On 30 June 2009 under a Scheme of Arrangement between Old Informa, the former holding company of the Group, and its 
shareholders under Part 26 of the UK Companies Act 2006, and as sanctioned by the High Court, all the issued shares in that 
Company were cancelled and the same number of new shares were issued to the Company in consideration for the allotment to 
shareholders of one ordinary share in the Old Informa for each ordinary share in the Company held on the record date, 30 June 2009.
On 20 July 2009, the Jersey Court approved the reduction of capital of Informa plc, whereby the nominal value of each ordinary share 
was reduced from 27 pence to 0.1 pence and the balance of the share premium account was transferred to retained earnings. The effect 
of the reduction of capital was to reduce share capital by £160.1m, reduce share premium by £1,839.3m and increase retained earnings 
by £1,999.4m. This also resulted in an authorised share capital of £202,500,000 divided into 202,500,000,000 shares of 0.1 pence.
Share capital as at 31 December 2009 amounted to £0.6m. During the period, Informa plc issued, in addition to the rights issue, 
223,568 ordinary shares of 0.1 pence for consideration of £0.2m as a result of the exercise of options and the vesting of LTIPs  
(2008: 494,738 ordinary shares of 0.1 pence for a consideration of £1.2m were issued as a result of the exercise of share options).

26 c apital and reserves
This note provides further explanation for the reserves listed in the Consolidated Statement of Changes in Equity.

The share capital and share premium reflect the new equity structure of the Company – refer to Note 1.
Reserve for shares to be issued
This reserve relates to share options granted to employees under the employee share option plan. Further information about share-
based payments to employees is set out in Note 37. 
Merger reserve
The merger reserve has not changed since 2004, when it was created from the business combination with Taylor & Francis Group plc.
Other reserve
Other reserve includes the redemption reserve, which is the reserve fund into which profits are allocated for the purpose of 
redeeming or buying back shares in the Company.
Since the creation of the new equity structure the inversion accounting has been recorded in this reserve – refer to Note 1.
ESOP Trust shares
As at 31 December 2009 the Informa Employee Share Trust held 189,050 (2008: 93,269) ordinary shares in the Company at a cost of 
£0.4m (2008: £0.4m) and a market value of £0.6m (2008: £0.2m). 71,628 shares (2008: Nil) held by the Employee Share Trust have not 
been allocated to individuals and accordingly, dividends on these shares are waived. The remaining 117,422 shares (2008: 93,269) 
held by the Employee Share Trust have been allocated to an individual and accordingly, dividends on these shares are payable. 
At 31 December 2009 the Group held 0.0% (2008: 0.0%) of its own called up share capital.
Hedging and translation reserve
This reserve has two elements (i) the hedging reserve which comprises the effective portion of the cumulative net change in the fair 
value of cash flow hedging instruments related to hedged transactions that have not yet occurred; and (ii) the translation reserve 
which comprises all foreign currency differences arising from the translation of the financial statements of foreign operations, as well 
as from the translation of liabilities that hedge the Company’s net investment in a foreign subsidiary.
Capital reserve
The capital reserve was created on 19 December 2007 as a result of the reduction of the Company’s issued share capital and 
cancellation of the Company’s share premium account. On 31 March 2008, the entire capital reserve was released to retained 
earnings in accordance with the terms of an undertaking given to the court in connection with the reduction and cancellation. 109 Informa plc Annual Report & Financial Statements for the year ended 31 December 2009

An analysis of the maturity of debt is given in Note 24 (g). 
The Directors consider that the carrying amount of trade payables approximates to their fair value. 
Trade payables and accruals principally comprise amounts outstanding for trade purchases and ongoing costs. The average credit 
period taken for trade purchases is 52 days (2008: 46 days). 
There are no suppliers who represent more than 10% of the total balance of trade payables in either 2009 or 2008.
The Group has financial risk management policies in place to ensure that all payables are paid within the credit time frame. Therefore, 
under the normal course of business, the Group is not charged interest on overdue payables.

Goodwill of £0.4m represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the intangible assets acquired. The goodwill 
arising on the acquisition is largely attributable to the anticipated incremental sales synergies associated with being part of the 
Group. The values are a best estimate of fair value but these will be reviewed and adjusted in the next year should this be necessary.
If the acquisitions had taken place on the first day of the financial year (1 January 2009), they would have contributed £0.7m to profit 
after tax attributable to equity shareholders and £3.2m to the revenue of the Group. 114

  These acquisitions are covered by the ‘Current year’s business combinations’ table on page 112. Where goodwill is provisional, a best estimate of fair value has been made but these will be 
reviewed and adjusted in the next year should it be necessary.
The combined benefit to the Group’s profit after tax from the newly acquired businesses amounted to £0.6m on revenues  
of £2.0m (2008: £3.3m on revenues of £1.3m). The total net assets of newly acquired businesses amounted to £19.9m as at  
31 December 2009 (2008: £9.6m). 
All acquisitions were paid for in cash (including deferred and contingent consideration) and in all acquisitions full control over 
the business has been acquired, either by acquiring 100% of the ordinary issued share capital or by means of an asset purchase 
transaction. All transactions have been accounted for by the purchase method of accounting. 115 Informa plc Annual Report & Financial Statements for the year ended 31 December 2009

36 r etirement benefit schemes
The Group operates three defined benefit pension schemes, the Informa Final Salary Scheme, the Taylor & Francis Group Pension and 
Life Assurance Scheme and the Achieve Learning (UK) Pension and Benefits Plan (the Group Schemes) for all qualifying UK employees 
providing benefits based on final pensionable pay. The assets of the Group Schemes are held in separate trustee administered funds. 
Contributions to the Group Schemes are charged to the Income Statement so as to spread the cost of contributions over employees’ 
working lives with the Group. Contributions are determined by a qualified actuary on the basis of triennial valuations using the 
projected unit method. 
Charge to operating profit
The charge to operating profit for the year in respect of pensions was £8.9m (2008: £8.5m). The net pension charge for the defined 
benefit schemes in the Consolidated Income Statement for the year was £2.2m (2008: £1.0m), of which £1.0m (2008: £1.3m) was 
charged to operating profit. The Group also operates defined contribution schemes, and contributions charged to the Consolidated 
Income Statement during the year were £7.9m (2008: £7.2m). 118

Defined benefit schemes
The latest full actuarial valuation of the Informa Final Salary Scheme was carried out at 31 March 2008. A full actuarial valuation was 
carried out for IAS 19 purposes as at 31 December 2009 by a qualified independent actuary. Employees who are members contribute 
10% of pensionable pay; the Group’s contribution was 16.5% of pensionable pay for the first nine months of the year, and 27.3% of 
pensionable pay for the rest of the year, plus an additional annual contribution of £0.6m. The market value of the scheme’s assets as 
at 31 December 2009 was £44.2m which represented 83% of the benefits (valued on an IAS 19 basis) that had accrued to members, 
after allowing for expected future increases in earnings. The Scheme was closed to new entrants on 1 April 2000.
The assumptions which have the most significant effect on the results of the valuation are those relating to the discount rate, rate of 
return on investments and the rates of increase in salaries, price inflation and pensions. The assumptions adopted are:

annual contribution of £1.0m. The market value of the scheme’s assets as at 31 December 2009 was £14.2m which represented 88% of the 
benefits (valued on an IAS 19 basis) that had accrued to members, after allowing for expected future increases in earnings. The Scheme 
closed to new entrants on 8 March 2002.

A further valuation was carried out at 31 December 2008 for IAS 19 purposes and was updated to 31 December 2009 by a qualified 
independent actuary. The scheme was closed to future accrual of pensions at the time of the acquisition of IIR Holdings Limited in 2005. The 
Group’s contribution over the year was £60,000. The market value of the scheme’s assets as at 31 December 2009 was £5.0m which represented 
91% of the benefits (valued on an IAS 19 basis) that had accrued to members, after allowing for expected future increases in inflation.  119 Informa plc Annual Report & Financial Statements for the year ended 31 December 2009

The expected return on assets assumptions are derived by considering the expected long-term rates of return on plan investments. 
The overall rate of return is a weighted average rate of return of each asset class. The long-term rates of return on equities and property 
are derived from considering current long-term fixed interest government bond rates with the addition of an appropriate future risk 
premium. The long-term rates of return on bonds and cash investments are set in line with market yields currently available.
The Schemes’ assets do not include any of the Group’s own financial instruments, nor any property occupied by, or other assets used 
by, the Group. 122

Following the completion of the triennial valuations of the main defined benefit schemes, a revised deficit funding plan has been 
agreed with the trustees to eliminate the deficits in the three schemes. The contributions for the ongoing service cost is estimated to 
increase from £1.0m in 2009 to £1.4m in 2010. In addition, the contributions paid towards reducing the scheme deficits will increase 
from £1.7m in 2009 to £2.4m in 2010 and £3.5m in 2011 when the next triennial valuation will be available.
37 s hare-based payments
The Group share options and Long-Term Incentive Plans (LTIPs) provide for a grant price equal to the average quoted market price of the 
Groups shares on the date of grant. The vesting period is generally 3 years. The options expire if they remain unexercised after the exercise 
period has lapsed. Furthermore, options are forfeited if the employee leaves the Group before the options vest. The options are equity-settled.
The Group recognised total expenses of £0.6m (2008: £0.5m) related to equity-settled share-based payment transactions in the year 
ended 31 December 2009.

In order to satisfy the share awards granted under Long-Term Incentive Plans, the share capital would be increased by up to 4,215,684 
shares. The company is planning to issue additional share capital to satisfy the awards although if circumstances change it may 
instead buy the shares as needed on the open market. 
Expected volatility was determined by calculating the historical volatility of the Group’s share price over one, two and three years 
back from the date of grant. The expected life used in the model has been adjusted, based on management’s best estimate, for the 
effects of non-transferability, exercise restrictions, and behavioural considerations.
On 4 August 2009 the number of shares granted for the Long-Term Incentive Plan scheme was 1,965,440 with no exercise cost. 
During the year, the 2006 LTIPs vested.

We have audited the parent company financial statements 
(the financial statements) of Informa plc for the period from 
11 March 2009 to 31 December 2009 which comprise the

policies set out therein. 
We have reported separately on the Group financial statements 
of Informa plc for the year ended 31 December 2009.
This report is made solely to the Company’s members, as a body, 
in accordance with Article 110 of the Companies (Jersey) Law 
1991. Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might 
state to the Company’s members those matters we are required 
to state to them in an auditors’ report and for no other purpose. 
To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or

report, or for the opinions we have formed.

The Directors' responsibilities for preparing the parent company 
financial statements in accordance with applicable law and

statements give a true and fair view and are properly prepared 
in accordance with the Companies (Jersey) Law 1991. We also

are appropriate to the company's circumstances, consistently 
applied and adequately disclosed.
We planned and performed our audit so as to obtain all the 
information and explanations which we considered necessary 
in order to provide us with sufficient evidence to give 
reasonable assurance that the financial statements are free 
from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or other 
irregularity or error. In forming our opinion we also evaluated 
the overall adequacy of the presentation of information in the 
financial statements.

For the year ended 31 December 2009
 1 c orporate information
Informa plc (the Company) was incorporated under Jersey Company Law on 11 March 2009, as a public company limited by shares 
with the name Informa Limited and changed its name on 29 April 2009 to Informa plc. The principal legislation under which the 
Company operates is the Companies (Jersey) Law 1991 and regulations made thereunder, although the Company is domiciled in 
Switzerland and therefore operates under Swiss tax laws.
Principal activity and business review
Informa Plc is the parent company of the Informa Group (the Group) and its principal activity is to act as the ultimate holding 
company of the Informa Group.
On 30 June 2009 under a Scheme of Arrangement between the former holding company of the Group (Old Informa), and its 
shareholders under Part 26 of the Companies Act 2006, and as sanctioned by the High Court, Informa plc became the holding 
company of Old Informa. All the issued shares in Old Informa were cancelled and the same number of new shares of 595,339,255, 
each with a nominal value of 27p, were issued by Informa plc. On 21 July 2009, the Jersey Court approved the reduction of capital – 
refer to Note 6. 
The shares of the Company are listed on the London Stock Exchange and trading in these shares commenced on 30 June 2009.
2 Accounting policies
Basis of accounting
The Company’s financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis (for further analysis – refer to Corporate 
Governance Statement on page 38) and under the historical cost convention and in accordance with the Companies (Jersey) Law 
1991 and United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice (UK GAAP). 
The Company’s financial statements cover the period from incorporation on 11 March 2009 to 31 December 2009 and hence, no 
comparative information is presented. They are presented in pounds sterling being the Company’s functional currency. 
The Directors’ Report, Corporate Governance Statement and Directors’ Remuneration Report disclosures have been made in the 
Group Annual Report of Informa plc.
Profit and loss account
Pursuant to Article 104 of the Companies (Jersey) Law 1991, the Company’s revenue for the period is £nil, loss before tax for the 
period is £6.6m and loss after tax and retained loss for the period is £6.6m.
Cash flow statement
The Company’s results for the period ended 31 December 2009 are included in the consolidated financial statements of  
Informa plc, which are publicly available. Consequently, the Company has taken advantage of the exemption from preparing a  
cash flow statement under the terms of FRS 1 (Revised 1996) Cash Flow Statements. 
Related party transactions
The Company has taken advantage of the exemption in FRS 8 Related Party Disclosures, that transactions with wholly owned 
subsidiaries, do not need to be disclosed.
Financial instruments
The Informa plc consolidated financial statements contain financial instrument disclosures required by IFRS 7 Financial Instruments: 
Disclosures and these would also comply with the disclosures required by FRS 29 Financial Instruments: Disclosures. Accordingly, the 
Company has taken advantage of the exemptions provided in paragraph 2D of FRS 29 not to present separate financial instrument 
disclosures for the Company. 127 Informa plc Annual Report & Financial Statements for the year ended 31 December 2009
Investments in subsidiaries
Investments held as fixed assets are stated at cost less any provision for impairment. Where the recoverable amount of the 
investment is less than the carrying amount, an impairment is recognised.
ESOP Trust shares
Own shares deducted in arriving at shareholders’ funds represent the cost of the Company’s ordinary shares acquired by the 
Employee Share Option Plan (ESOP) trusts in connection within certain of the Company’s employee share schemes.
Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash on hand and demand deposits, and other short-term highly liquid investments that are 
readily convertible (with a maturity of three months or less) to a known amount of cash and are subject to an insignificant risk of 
changes in value.
Share-based payments
The Company issues equity settled share-based payments to certain employees. A fair value for the equity settled share awards is 
measured at the date of grant. The fair value is measured using the Binomial or Monte Carlo model of valuation, which are considered 
to be the most appropriate valuation techniques. The valuation takes into account factors such as non-transferability, exercise 
restrictions and behavioural considerations. To assign a fair value to share awards granted under the Share Matching Plan where the 
proportion of the award released is dependent on the level of total shareholder return, the Monte Carlo Simulation methodology is 
considered the most appropriate.
In terms of FRS 20 Share-based payment, where a parent grants rights to its equity instruments of a subsidiary, and such share-based 
compensation is accounted for as equity-settled in the consolidated financial statements of the parent, the subsidiary is required 
to record an expense for such compensation, with a corresponding increase recognised in equity as a contribution from the parent. 
Consequently, in accordance with UITF 44 FRS 20 (IFRS 2) – Group and Treasury Transactions the Company has recognised an addition 
to fixed asset investments of the aggregate amount of these contributions that have accrued in the period after the Company 
became the ultimate holding company of the Group of £0.5m with a corresponding credit to equity shareholders’ funds.
Foreign currencies
Foreign currency transactions arising from operating activities are translated from local currency into pounds sterling at the 
exchange rates prevailing at the date of the transaction. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at the 
year-end are translated at the period end exchange rate. Foreign currency gains or losses are credited or charged to the Profit and 
Loss account as they arise.
Interest income
Interest income is accrued on a time basis, by reference to the principal outstanding and at the effective interest rate applicable, 
which is the rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash receipts through the expected life of the financial asset to that asset’s 
net carrying amount.
Interest expense 
Finance costs of debts are capitalised against the debt value on first drawdown of the debt and are recognised in the Profit and Loss 
account at a constant rate over the life of the debt.  128

r egistrars 
Informa’s Registrar is Equiniti. The Shareholder Helpline 
run by Equiniti is available between Monday and Friday, 
8.30 am to 5.00 pm. The UK number to call is 0870 384 
2381, if you are calling from outside the UK please call:  
+44 121 415 7047. This helpline deals with various  
share related queries.
They also offer a free online service which enables you to:
view and manage all of your shareholdings; •	
register for electronic communications; •	
buy and sell shares instantly online •	
with the dealing service; and
other shareholder services such as change of •	
address, transfer shares or replace a lost certificate.
Visit www.shareview.co.uk/myportfolio for further 
information. You will need your shareholder reference 
number as shown on your share certificate. 
If you currently hold a Shareview Portfolio account which 
was registered prior to the Register moving to Jersey in 
June 2009 you will need to re-register under the new 
web-address. You can register quickly and easily by going 
to www.shareview.co.uk/myportfolio and clicking on the 
‘Open a FREE portfolio’ button in the middle of the home 
page. You’ll be asked for the following information:
the company in which you hold shares •	
or loan notes managed by Equiniti;
your last name as it appears on a recent •	
share certificate or tax voucher;
shareholder reference; •	
your postcode; •	
your current email address; and •	
you will also be asked for your preferred method •	
of communication (i.e. electronic or hard 
copy) – please choose the hard copy option.
You will then be asked to create a password. This needs 
to be a mixture of 4-8 alphanumeric characters that you 
alone will be able to remember (e.g. pa55w0rd).
Once you have read the terms and conditions click 
the ‘Go’ button to send the Access Number to your 
registered address.
Your new Access Number will arrive by post a few  
days later. You will then have all you need to log into  
your new Portfolio.
g lobal payments s ervice
This service provided by Informa’s Registrar enables 
shareholders to have dividend payments paid directly 
into their bank account in their chosen local currency.  
To view terms and register for this service, please visit 
www.shareview.co.uk/myportfolio. 
d ividend
Informa pays a dividend to all shareholders twice each 
year. Informa operates a Dividend Access Plan for all 
its shareholders. Those shareholders who hold fewer 
than 100,000 shares are deemed to consent to receive 
their dividends from a UK Informa company. However 
those shareholders holding over 100,000 shares need 
to elect to join the Dividend Access Plan by completing 
an Election Form. This form is available from Informa’s 
Registrars by calling 0871 384 2381. If you are calling 
from outside the UK please call: +44 121 415 7047. If you 
hold over 100,000 shares and do not elect to join the 
Dividend Access Plan, you will receive your dividends 
from Informa’s Swiss holding company.
Alternatively, shareholders can elect to receive shares 
instead of cash from their dividend allocation through 
the Dividend Reinvestment Plan (DRIP)
Shareholders can also arrange for dividends to be paid 
by mandate directly to a UK bank or building society 
account through the BACSTEL-IP (Bankers’ Automated 
Clearing Services) system. For the benefit of shareholders 
resident in any of the eurozone countries, the Company 
offers the option to receive dividends in Euros.
s hare d ealing
If shareholders wish to buy or sell any Informa shares, 
they can do so by calling the Company’s Brokers, Natwest 
Stockbrokers, on 0808 208 4433. Instructions on how 
to deal will be provided over the phone. The helpline 
is open 8.00 am to 4.30 pm UK time, Monday to Friday, 
except Bank Holidays.

to over 1,400 different UK charities. Further information

electronic s hareholder c ommunication
As part of Informa’s Corporate Social Responsibility 
programme and in particular our ongoing commitment 
to reduce our environmental impact, we offer all 
shareholders the opportunity to elect to register for 
electronic communications. For further information 
please visit www.informa.com 
protecting your Investment from 
s hare r egister Fraud
Informa plc is legally obliged to make its share register 
available to the general public. Consequently some 
shareholders may receive unsolicited mail, including 
correspondence from unauthorised investment companies.
Over the last year a number of companies have become 
aware that their shareholders have received unsolicited 
phone calls or correspondence concerning investment 
matters. These are typically from overseas based brokers 
who target UK shareholders offering to sell what often 
turn out to be worthless or high risk shares in US or UK 
investments. They can be extremely persuasive and very 
persistent. Shareholders are advised to be very wary of 
any unsolicited advice, offers to buy shares at a discount 
or offers of free company reports.
If you receive any unsolicited investment advice:
make sure you get the correct name •	
of the person and organisation;
check that they are properly authorised •	
by the FSA before getting involved. You 
can check at www.fsa.gov.uk/register;
report the matter to the FSA either •	
by calling 0845 606 1234; and
inform our Registrar’s on 0871 384 2381 •	
t ips on protecting your s hareholding
Ensure all your certificates are kept •	
in a safe place or hold your shares 
electronically in CREST via a nominee.
Keep all correspondence from the Registrars in a safe •	
place, or destroy correspondence by shredding it.
If you change address inform the Registrars. •	
If you receive a letter from the Registrars 
regarding a change of address and you have not 
recently moved, contact them immediately.
Know when the dividends are paid and consider •	
having your dividend paid directly into your 
bank (contact the Registrars). If you change 
your bank account, inform the Registrars of the 
details of your new account. Respond to any 
letters the Registrars send to you about this.
If you are buying or selling shares, only •	
deal with brokers registered in the UK 
or in your country of residence. 136

La Tasca Group plc
Annual Report and Accounts 2006
We are pleased to report another
strong set of results for the year ending
30 April 2006, which was our first full
year as an AIM listed Company.
Results 
The Company’s financial performance
was good. Turnover grew by 13.8%
from £48.8 million in the year ending
30 April 2005 to £55.6 million in this
latest year. Earnings before interest, 
tax, depreciation and amortisation
(EBITDA) increased by 18.5% from 
£8.4 million to £10.0 million. 
Operating profit (pre amortisation 
of goodwill) rose by 16.8% from 
£6.1 million to £7.1 million. Pre-tax
profit before goodwill amortisation was
up by 55.3% to £6.1 million and fully
diluted earnings per share (EPS) before
goodwill was 7.88p, a 50.1% increase.
At the year end, net debt was £16.7
million representing gearing of 68.2%.
Strategic overview
During the year we have made good
progress in strengthening the position
of La Tasca as the leading Spanish
restaurant brand in the UK, while
broadening the base of the Company 
by developing new brands and markets.
We opened 8 new La Tasca restaurants
in the UK to reach 54 in total. We
have targeted our openings at the
economically strong South East of the
country, particularly central London
where we have been underrepresented.
The team have worked particularly 
hard to improve our management
retention rates which are key to
growing customer loyalty and
shareholder value in this industry.
Our second Spanish concept called 
La Viña Bar and Restaurant has
progressed well. Designed to appeal 
to a different customer demographic, 
it is allowing us to make further inroads
in to the Spanish market segment and
raise our sights on the number of
restaurants and bars we can open in 
the UK. 
Our development and testing of 
La Tasca in the USA market is showing
promising signs. Both the Washington
and Clarendon Virginia restaurants 
are competing in the toughest casual
dining market in the world and yet
delivered excellent sales and operating
profits. This not only confirms the
strength of our unique brand but is
providing valuable insight for our UK
operations. Baltimore which opened 
in March in a spectacular site on the
harbour front is our third outlet, 
in a plan to open 7 before we seek
partners to support further growth. 
Finally we are delighted to have
initiated a fourth new potential income
opportunity. Specifically our team have
created a new concept Sam and Maxie’s
Bar, Grill and Smokehouse. This is a
premium casual affordable dining offer
and is targeted particularly for leisure
parks and shopping centres – trading
locations which are known well by our
management team. The first outlet at
Stevenage Leisure Park is off to a good
start and two prime locations have
been acquired, one in the Trafford
Centre in Manchester and the other 
in Milton Keynes. The total number 
of restaurants in operation at the year
end was 64.
Dividend 
A final dividend is proposed of 0.74p
per share (nil in 2005) to be paid to 
all shareholders on the register at 
1 September 2006. On top of the
interim dividend paid of 0.37p per
share, the total for the year will be
1.11p per share.
Prospects 
We have had a slow start to the new
financial year as the football World Cup
has negatively impacted traditionally
strong summer trading weeks.
Moreover up to 14 new site openings 
will not offset these shortfalls as the
openings and their pre-opening 
costs occur towards the end of the
financial year.
However with the people, systems, and
strong brand line up we have in place,
we remain fully confident of delivering
further good growth in the year ahead.

La Tasca Group plc
Annual Report and Accounts 2006
Chief Executive’s overview
Introduction
This has been another good year for the
Company. The results for the 52 weeks
ended 30 April 2006, compare
favourably with the 53 weeks of last
year and are a credit to the whole team.
I remain very proud to work with such
an enthusiastic, hardworking and
dynamic team.
During the year we managed to
increase the profitability of our core 
La Tasca business in the UK as well
investing strategically in new concepts
and types of locations. Our aim is to
capitalise on market trends and to
deliver continued, sustainable, strong
growth in shareholder value. Whilst La
Tasca UK remains the cornerstone of all
our efforts, our three other avenues of
growth: La Tasca in the USA ; a second
brand – La Viña Bar and Restaurant; and
our new concept – Sam & Maxie’s Bar
Grill and Smokehouse; have progressed
well in the year and continue to be
sources of growth. During the year we
opened 14 new restaurants to finish the
year trading 64 restaurants. 
Financial results
Turnover for the period rose from
£48.8m to £55.6m, an increase of
13.8%. EBITDA was up to £10.0m from
£8.4m an increase of 18.5% and
operating profit (pre amortisation of
goodwill) was up to £7.1m from £6.1m,
an increase of 16.8%. Profit before tax
(before goodwill amortisation) was up
55.3% to £6.1m and diluted earnings
per share (before goodwill amortisation)
increased by 50.1% to 7.88p.
We remain focused upon delivering
returns on investment that are at the
top end of the industry. Our target
when the company floated in February
2005 was to achieve an average 26%
restaurant EBIT return on total invested
capital and I am pleased to report that
we continue to be ahead of this target
with an average return on capital
invested for the full year across the
portfolio of 28%.
This good performance has been
achieved despite experiencing
considerable increase in operating
costs, of which the licensing reform,
duty increases, utility increases, rates
revaluation and minimum wage were
the most significant. In addition, we
have also had to bear the costs of five of
our new openings commencing trading
late in the last quarter which, together
with the increased pre-opening costs
associated with Sam & Maxie’s and the
development of our third restaurant in
Baltimore in the USA, have offset the
contribution from the restaurants
opened earlier in the year. It is anticipated
that the costs in the current year will be
more in line with previous years.
As at the year end, the net debt position
of the Company was £16.7m an increase
of just over £2m (2005: £14.6m)
despite £10.7m of capital expenditure
being incurred in the year, clearly
demonstrating the strong cash
generative nature of the Company.
A final dividend is recommended of
0.74p (2005: Nil) per share and, if passed
by shareholders at the AGM, will be paid
on 29 September 2006 to all shareholders
on the register as at 1 September 2006.
This will bring the total dividend for the
year to 1.11p per share.
Operations
During the year our operating team 
has taken on additional responsibilities
associated with our expanding estate.
They have responded well to these new
challenges, and I am very grateful to
them for their contribution to the
performance of the business.
We are continually focused on building
the infrastructure of the business for
the future. We have developed a strong
management team for La Tasca UK and
have invested heavily this year into the
appointment of a ‘Brand Champion’ for
each of the other three parts of our
business, La Tasca USA, La Viña and Sam
& Maxie’s. We have also increased the
number of single site managers
operating on the Managing Partner
scheme and have improved our
retention of management by 8%.
People are key to the restaurant
business and we continue to make
significant strides in improving the
training that our employees receive 
and the standards that our customers
enjoy. In recognition of this work, the
Company received ‘The Best Place to
Work in Hospitality’ Award in April this
year. This accolade is a credit to all of
our team.
La Tasca UK
La Tasca UK remains the major profit
and growth contributor within the
Group and at the year end we had 
54 La Tasca restaurants in the UK.
Maintaining and evolving our brands 
is of paramount importance and
throughout the year, La Tasca UK has
seen many areas of product and brand
development including design
enhancements in our restaurants and 
a new menu style and presentation. 
We are particularly pleased with the
performance of the mature restaurants
in the portfolio. Once again this year,
our oldest restaurant, in Deansgate,
Manchester (13 years), has enjoyed
both increased turnover and increased
profitability compared to last year and,
like the majority of older La Tasca
restaurants, is able to deliver solid
results with little ongoing capital,
thereby improving the cash on cash
returns on capital. 
We have sought to increase the
geographic representation of La Tasca
UK, particularly in the South East. This
year we have increased the number of
sites we operate in London and believe
there remains considerable potential 
in the London market. We now have 
six Central London La Tasca restaurants
and believe that there are many
opportunities to open further
restaurants in high footfall areas, 
where ‘daisy chaining’ is evident and
where we can also build our brand
awareness through strategically
increasing our exposure. 
Overall, we continue to remain focused
on maintaining our core offering of
serving good quality Spanish tapas in 
a fun and vibrant Spanish atmosphere. 05

Expansion
The Company opened 14 new restaurants throughout the year and concluded the
year with 64 restaurants trading. Of this, the breakdown was; 
New restaurants
La T asca UK 8
La T asca USA 1
La Viña 4
Sam & Maxie’s 1
The Company continues to operate in different styles of properties in differing
locations. I have updated the sub sector breakdown of these with the addition 
of the newly opened restaurants. Within the UK, the breakdown is currently;
Restaurants
City/Town mixed use 32
High Streets 14
Shopping Centres 6
Leisure Parks 6
Suburbs 3
Total UK restaurants 61
The openings in the year were heavily weighted towards the end of the year, with five
out of the 14 opening within the last seven weeks of the financial year. 
“We have further developed La Viña
and are excited about the prospects
for this brand which we intend to
expand. Sam & Maxie’s has
progressed from concept to reality.”
Expanding the La Viña brand
New Bar, Grill & Smokehouse concept La Tasca USA
La Tasca USA also had a good year. The
restaurants in both Washington DC and
Clarendon, Virginia have performed
well, with Washington DC continuing to
be in the top five turnover restaurants
within the Group and enjoying the
largest like for like sales growth within
our portfolio. Both restaurants make
significant contribution to the
Company’s operating profit. The
opening of our restaurant in Baltimore
was delayed until March 2006 due to
vacant possession being achieved later
than was originally anticipated,
however the restaurant is now open
and is trading in line with our
expectations. Our USA strategy is
unchanged, and is to build up to seven
restaurants, prove that we have a
successful and proven business model
and then explore ways of creating
shareholder value with the structuring
of a financial partner with the local
management experience and resources
to further develop the USA market.
La Viña Bar and Restaurant
La Viña Bar and Restaurant has had 
a very good year. We opened four 
new La Viña restaurants, in Leeds,
Newcastle, Sheffield and Manchester.
There is plenty of scope to have a
second, more premium style and priced
Spanish brand, offering a different
menu to a different audience and
thereby strengthening our position as
the only national operator of Spanish
restaurants within the UK. La Tasca and
La Viña are complementary to each
other. During the year we have
developed La Viña in terms of menu,
service standards, design and brand
values and we remain confident that
there is significant opportunity for 
La Viña nationwide. We are currently
looking at opportunities to expand 
La Viña into London where there is
considerable scope for this brand.
Sam & Maxie’s Bar, Grill and
Smokehouse
We have created a third concept, 
Sam & Maxie’s. This new Bar, Grill and
Smokehouse concept opened in April
2006 in Stevenage Leisure Park. Whilst
it is still at an early stage in its
development, we are very confident
that with Sam & Maxie’s we have
created a concept that has the potential
to become a brand, to open in many
formats and locations nationwide 
and deliver high returns on investment
and strong shareholder value. Two
further Sam & Maxie’s will open prior 
to Christmas this year, one in the 
highly successful Trafford Centre 
in Manchester and the other in 
Milton Keynes.
Outlook
The new financial year has begun
slowly, affected primarily by the greater
than anticipated impact of the football
World Cup falling in what is a
traditionally busy few weeks for the
Company. Coupled with this, our
opening programme for the current
year is again predominantly late second
half weighted. As a result, we anticipate
there being little contribution from
these restaurants in the current year
whilst the pre-opening costs will have
been incurred in the year. In total, we
aim to open up to 14 new restaurants;
two will be in the USA and the
remainder split between our three 
UK brands, La Tasca, La Viña and 
Sam & Maxie’s. 
We are operating in the buoyant 
casual dining sector and anticipate 
that trading will return to normal levels
following the end of the World Cup. 
We have an excellent business that
generates good returns and we have
developed new income streams and
brands that augur well for the future.
We have put in place the infrastructure
for the business to grow; people,
management and systems to build a
bigger business. We are confident of
delivering further progress in the
current year.

La Tasca is the UK’s leading Spanish
casual dining restaurant offer. 
By far the largest part of our business
and now trading throughout the UK
From as far north as Aberdeen to as
west as Swansea and Plymouth as south
as Brighton and Portsmouth and as east
as Norwich, La Tasca is the biggest
national group of Spanish restaurants. 
La Tasca likes to put tapas on a ‘big
stage’. In fun, friendly and vibrant
environments, La Tasca gives you a
feeling of being away on holiday, and
with over 20 million people visiting
Spain from the UK every year, there’s 
a lot of reminiscing to be done! Suitable
for small or large groups and offering
excellent value for money, La Tasca is 
a great casual dining experience.
8 new La Tasca restaurants opened in
the year and we are looking to continue
this growth with a specific emphasis on
expanding in the London area, where
we believe there to be considerable
opportunity.

We created La Viña in the summer of
2004 and opened the first one in Hale,
on the outskirts of Manchester.
La Viña is complementary to La Tasca
and strengthens our position as the
leading Spanish restaurant operator in
the country. In design terms, La Viña
feels like it originates from Seville. The
ambience is a combination of quality,
combined with a feeling of being 
able to relax.
Whilst the main menu concentrates 
on tapas, we also have a selection 
of raciones.
During the year, we opened 4 new 
La Viña locations in Leeds, Newcastle,
Sheffield and Manchester and are very
excited for the potential for this brand
on a nationwide roll out.

In the second half of the year, we

Smokehouse concept and successfully
opened the first one in Stevenage in
April 2006. 
This concept is aimed at targeting the
family market with a new ‘premium but
affordable’ casual dining restaurant and
bar. Sam & Maxie’s specialises in freshly
smoked products, like chicken, ribs, and
salmon, although the menu has many
other great alternatives as well!
We are already building the second 
Sam & Maxie’s in the highly successful
Trafford Centre which is scheduled to
open this September and then in Milton

Corporate Governance
This report sets out how the company complies with the Principles of Good Corporate Governance.
The Board
The Board currently comprises two non–executives and three executive directors as detailed on page 33. Under the
Combined Code however, as I Edwards has share options and owns shares and M J Barnes owns shares in the Company they
may be deemed not to be independent. However, notwithstanding this the Board considers the advice and leadership given
by M J Barnes and I Edwards to be independent. M J Barnes is the senior non–executive director. The Board meets formally at
least 10 times a year with additional meetings as and when required and these meetings are attended by all the directors.
The Board receives briefing papers prior to meetings as is required to properly fulfil its duties. The Board also receives 
details of financial and operational matters on a monthly basis. The Board is responsible for policy and strategy of the 
Group. Operational matters are delegated to the executive directors.
The Board considers that the calibre and number of the non–executive directors is sufficient to provide an independent
influence to the Board. 14

executive directors may be invited to attend its meetings. The committee meets at least three times per year. The external
auditors attend these meetings as invited but have direct access to the non–executive directors for independent discussions
without the presence of executive directors. The audit committee is responsible for reviewing matters relating to financial
reporting, accounting policies, compliance with accounting standards, ensuring the objectivity and independence of the
external auditors, keeping under review the company’s internal controls and risk management systems, the appointment 
of external auditors and approval of their fees and other functions as the Board may request.
The remuneration committee is formally constituted with written terms of reference and comprises two non–executive
directors and is chaired by M J Barnes. The committee determines the remuneration policies of the Group which include 
the terms and conditions, including annual remuneration and incentive awards, of the executive directors. 
Communication with shareholders
The Company communicates with its shareholders through the Annual Report and Interim Report and maintains an ongoing
dialogue with institutional investors. The Board welcomes all shareholders at the Annual General Meeting where they are
able to put questions to the Board.
Internal control
The Directors acknowledge they are responsible for the Group’s systems of internal control and for reviewing the effectiveness
of these systems. The risk management process and systems of internal control are designed to manage rather than
eliminate the risk of the Group failing to achieve its strategic objectives. It should be recognised that such systems can only
provide reasonable and not absolute assurance against material misstatement or loss.
The Group has well established procedures which have been developed over many years which meet the requirements of
the Turnbull Guidance. 
Internal audit
The Board has considered the need for an internal audit function, but has decided that the size of the Group renders this
inappropriate at this time. The Board will continue to review this decision going forward.
Going concern
After making enquiries, the Directors have a reasonable expectation that the Group will continue in operational existence for
the foreseeable future. For this reason, they continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the financial statements.
Statement of directors’ responsibilities
The directors are responsible for preparing the directors’ report and the financial statements in accordance with applicable
law and United Kingdom Accounting Standards (United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice).
Company law requires the directors to prepare financial statements for each financial year which give a true and fair view 
of the state of affairs of the Company and the Group and of the profit or loss of the Group for that period. In preparing these
financial statements, the directors are required to:
• select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently;
• make judgments and estimates that are reasonable and prudent;
• state whether applicable accounting standards have been followed, subject to any material departures disclosed and
explained in the financial statements; 
• prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis unless it is inappropriate to presume that the Company and
Group will continue in business. 15
La Tasca Group plc
Annual Report and Accounts 2006
The directors are responsible for maintaining proper accounting records that disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time
the financial position of the Group and enable them to ensure that the financial statements comply with the Companies Act
1985. They are also responsible for safeguarding the assets of the Group and for taking reasonable steps for the prevention
and detection of fraud and other irregularities.
In so far as the directors are aware:
• there is no relevant audit information of which the company’s auditors are unaware; and
• the directors have taken all steps that they ought to have taken to make themselves aware of any relevant audit
information and to establish that the auditors are aware of that information.
The directors’ are responsible for the maintenance and integrity of the corporate and financial information included on the
company’s website. Legislation in the United Kingdom governing the preparation and dissemination of financial statements
may differ from legislation in other jurisdictions.
Transition to International Financial Reporting Standards (“IFRS”)
The Board has considered the Group’s transition to IFRS in 2008. A transition plan is currently in progress covering two
phases – preliminary assessment and implementation.
Supplier payment policy
The Group’s and Company’s policy concerning the payment of creditors is to pay in accordance with the contractual and
other legal obligations as advised to and agreed with the creditors prior to any transactions taking place.
The Group’s average creditor payment period at 30 April 2006 was 47 days (2005: 47 days).
Charitable donations
During the period, the Group made charitable donations of £Nil (2005: £5,000).
Employee involvement
The Group has continued its practice of keeping employees informed of matters affecting them as employees and the
financial and economic factors affecting the performance of the Group. This is achieved through regular meetings with
employees and through the Group newsletter.
Disabled employees
Applications for employment by disabled persons are given full and fair consideration for all vacancies in accordance with
their particular aptitudes and abilities. In the event of employees becoming disabled, every effort is made to retain them 
in order that their employment with the Group may continue.
Financial risk management objectives and policies
Details of the Group’s financial risk management objectives and policies are set out in note 16 to these financial statements.
Auditors
Grant Thornton UK LLP have indicated their willingness to continue as auditors.

Report of the independent auditors to the 
members of La Tasca Group plc
We have audited the group and parent company financial statements (the “financial statements”) of La Tasca Group plc for
the year ended 30 April 2006 which comprise the principal accounting policies, the group profit and loss account, the group 
and company balance sheets, the group cash flow statement, the group statement of total recognised gains and losses 
and notes 1 to 26. These financial statements have been prepared under the accounting policies set out therein. 
This report is made solely to the company’s members, as a body, in accordance with Section 235 of the Companies Act 1985.
Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might state to the company’s members those matters we are required to
state to them in an auditors’ report and for no other purpose. To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or
assume responsibility to anyone other than the company and the company’s members as a body, for our audit work, 
for this report, or for the opinions we have formed.
Respective responsibilities of directors and auditors
The directors’ responsibilities for preparing the Annual Report and the financial statements in accordance with United
Kingdom law and Accounting Standards (United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice) are set out in the
Statement of Directors’ Responsibilities.
Our responsibility is to audit the financial statements in accordance with relevant legal and regulatory requirements and
International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland).
We report to you our opinion as to whether the financial statements give a true and fair view and are properly prepared in
accordance with the Companies Act 1985. We also report to you if, in our opinion, the Directors’ Report is not consistent
with the financial statements, if the company has not kept proper accounting records, if we have not received all the
information and explanations we require for our audit, or if information specified by law regarding directors’ remuneration
and other transactions is not disclosed.
We read other information contained in the Annual Report, and consider whether it is consistent with the audited financial
statements. This other information comprises only the Chairman’s Statement, Chief Executive’s Review and the Directors’
Report. We consider the implications for our report if we become aware of any apparent misstatements or material
inconsistencies with the financial statements. Our responsibilities do not extend to any other information.
Basis of audit opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland) issued by the Auditing
Practices Board. An audit includes examination, on a test basis, of evidence relevant to the amounts and disclosures in the
financial statements. It also includes an assessment of the significant estimates and judgments made by the directors in the
preparation of the financial statements, and of whether the accounting policies are appropriate to the group’s and company’s
circumstances, consistently applied and adequately disclosed. We planned and performed our audit so as to obtain all 
the information and explanations which we considered necessary in order to provide us with sufficient evidence to give
reasonable assurance that the financial statements are free from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or other
irregularity or error. 
In forming our opinion we also evaluated the overall adequacy of the presentation of information in the financial statements. 
Opinion
In our opinion:
• the financial statements give a true and fair view, in accordance with United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting
Practice, of the state of the group’s and the parent company’s affairs as at 30 April 2006 and of the group’s profit for the
year then ended; 
• the financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 1985; and
• the information given in the Directors’ Report is consistent with the financial statements for the year ended 30 April 2006.

La Tasca Group plc
Annual Report and Accounts 2006
Principal accounting policies
The financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention and in accordance with applicable 
United Kingdom Accounting Standards.
The principal accounting policies of the Group set out below have remained unchanged from the previous year with the
exception of the adoption of Financial Reporting Standard No.21 (Events after the Balance Sheet Date), Financial Reporting
Standard No.22 (Earnings per Share), the presentation requirements of Financial Reporting Standard No.25 (Financial
Instruments: Disclosure and Presentation) and Financial Reporting Standard No.28 (Corresponding Amounts). There has
been no material impact on the Group on the adoption of these new standards.
Basis of consolidation
The Group financial statements consolidate those of the Company and of its subsidiary undertakings drawn up to 30 April 2006
(a 52 week period). The financial statements for the year ended 30 April 2005 represented a 53 week period.
All intra Group profits are eliminated on consolidation. On acquisition of a subsidiary, all of the subsidiary’s assets and
liabilities which exist at the date of acquisition are recorded at their fair value reflecting their condition at that date. 
Goodwill
Goodwill arising on consolidation representing the excess of the fair value of the consideration given over the fair value of
the identifiable net assets acquired is capitalised and amortised over its useful economic life, up to a maximum of 20 years
which the directors believe is the most appropriate amortisation period. 
Turnover
Turnover is the total amount receivable by the Group for goods supplied and services provided, excluding VAT.
Tangible fixed assets and depreciation
Tangible fixed assets are stated at cost, including any incidental costs of acquisition, less depreciation. Depreciation is
calculated to write down the cost less estimated residual value of all tangible fixed assets on a straight line basis over their
expected useful lives. The expected useful lives are as follows:
Leasehold buildings and improvements Term of lease
Equipment, fixtures and fittings 7 to 10 years
Computer equipment 5 years
Motor vehicles 5 years 
Stocks
Stocks are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
Deferred taxation
Deferred tax is recognised on all timing differences where the transactions or events that give the Group an obligation to pay
more tax in the future, or a right to pay less tax in the future, have occurred by the balance sheet date. Deferred tax assets
are recognised when it is more likely than not that they will be recovered. Deferred tax is measured using rates of tax that
have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet.
Financial instruments
The Group’s financial instruments comprise cash, bank deposits, borrowings and various items such as trade debtors and
trade creditors that arise from its operations.
Financial assets are recognised in the balance sheet at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Provision is made for
diminution in value where appropriate. Income and expenditure arising in the financial statements is recognised on the
accruals basis and credited or charged to the profit and loss account in the financial period to which it relates. 18
La Tasca Group plc
Annual Report and Accounts 2006
Principal accounting policies
continued
Leased assets
Assets held under finance leases and hire purchase contracts are capitalised in the balance sheet and depreciated over their
expected useful lives. The interest element of leasing payments represents a constant proportion of the capital balance
outstanding and is charged to the profit and loss account over the term of the lease.
Reverse premiums and similar benefits are spread on a straight line basis over the period to the date at which the rent is
reviewed to market levels.
All other leases are regarded as operating leases and the payments made under them are charged to the profit and loss
account on a straight line basis over the lease term.
Contribution to pension funds
The pension costs charged against profits represent the amount of the contributions payable to personal pension plans in
respect of the accounting year.
Foreign currency
Transactions in foreign currencies are recorded at the rate of exchange at the date of the transaction. Monetary assets and
liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at the balance sheet date are reported at the rates of exchange prevailing at
that date, and the gains or losses on transactions are included in the profit and loss account. 
The results of overseas operations are translated at the average rates of exchange during the year and their balance sheets 
at the rates ruling at the balance sheet date.
The exchange differences arising from the retranslation of the opening net investment in subsidiaries are taken directly 
to reserves. 19

The calculation of basic earnings per share is based on profit attributable to ordinary shareholders divided by the weighted average
number of ordinary shares in issue during the year. The calculation of diluted earnings per share is based on the basic earnings per
share to allow for the assumed conversion of dilutive options. 
The calculation of the adjusted diluted earning per share is as illustrated in the table below:

or LIBOR. The bank loans are repayable by half yearly instalments commencing 31 October 2006. 
The assets held under finance leases and hire purchase contracts are secured on the assets to which they relate.
16. Financial instruments
The Board of Directors regularly reviews the financial requirements of the Group and the risks associated therewith. The main risks
arising from the Group’s financial instruments are as follows:
Interest rate risk
The Group finances its operations through a mixture of trading cash flows and bank borrowings. Borrowings are in sterling and US
dollars and are at floating rates of interest. The Group seeks to minimise the cost of borrowings and reduce the impact of interest
rate fluctuations.
Liquidity risk
The Group seeks to manage financial risk to ensure sufficient liquidity is available to meet foreseeable needs. Surplus funds are
placed on deposit and are available at short notice.
Currency risk
The vast majority of the Group’s revenues and costs are in sterling and involve no currency risk. The Group reviews its currency
exposure on a continual basis and will enter into hedges if considered necessary.

immaterial value of the Group’s trade debtors, the credit risk associated with these is minimal.
Short term debtors and creditors

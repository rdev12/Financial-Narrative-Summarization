C ar l	B ac on	
Chairman 
25 March 2011   Overview  We are pleased with our progress 
in 2010.  As has been shown in recent years, we 
have a robust business which is profitable and 
significantly cash generative.  We operate in an 
expanding global market whose growth is set to 
accelerate and we have bolstered our product 
offering to cater for that demand.
The major event of 2010 for StatPro was the beta 
launch of cloud-based StatPro Revolution. We have 
been working on StatPro Revolution since 2007 
and have been steadily increasing our investment 
in it over this period in anticipation of the growth 
in the global asset management industry. StatPro 
Revolution is so named because of its significant 
difference to traditional software in terms of ease 
of use, deployment, price and scalability. We have 
designed it to make it easy and free for users to 
share information with others and this will be the 
key benefit of the service to subscribers.
The investment in Revolution has impacted our 
profits in 2010 and we expect will continue to do 
so during 2011, as this is an important part of our 
future growth strategy. We are delighted to have our 
first customers for Revolution including RBC Dexia 
Investment Services, after it went live on 28 February 
2011, and we hope to sign up many more partners 
and clients during the course of 2011. As noted in 
our January 2011 trading statement, we will also be 
expanding our investment during 2011 in StatPro 
Revolution not only in development but also for 
support, sales and marketing.
We continue to make excellent progress with 
StatPro Seven. We are working hard to move 
our clients to our hosted environment and now 
have 30% by value converted (2009: 20%). We 
also secured 44 new client contracts during 
2010. One of our key strategies is to sell StatPro 
Revolution and StatPro Seven together, with 
StatPro Seven as the production system and 
StatPro Revolution as the distribution system. 
In this way, clients can enjoy the combined 
benefits of our services.
Financial Highlights  Revenue for the year was up 
5% to £33.13 million (2009: £31.56 million). Adjusted 
profit before tax was down 3% to £6.68 million 
(2009: £6.90 million) reflecting the investment 
in StatPro Revolution which reduced operating 
margins to 22.3% (2009: 24.7%). Nevertheless, net 
debt was reduced to £5.52 million (2009: £8.89 
million) and cash flow from operating activities 
(before exceptional payments) increased 5% to 
£10.66 million (2009: £10.15 million). Our renewal 
rate improved to 92% (2009: 90%). We still felt 
some residual impact of the 2008 financial crisis 
as consolidations and acquisitions represent the 
fundamental reasons behind cancellations of client 
contracts, however, the very stable nature of our 
core products, the long term contracts and recurring 
revenue that they provide, enable us to invest with 
confidence in the next generation of technology.
Regional performance  The strongest markets for 
us in 2010 were in the EMEAA region, in particular in 
Europe. Our strategy for StatPro Seven has opened 
up the middle market for our services and resulted in 
an increase in activity. There is considerable interest in 
risk systems and improving reporting solutions in all 
these markets. Our South African and Australian offices 
also performed well and pre-marketing of StatPro 
Revolution shows that there is a strong appetite for it 
in these markets where asset managers generally have 
smaller budgets. In North America, we made good 
progress with sales of StatPro Seven, however, sales of 
StatPro Unlimited (data services) were lower year on 
year. The vast US market has considerable potential for 
StatPro Revolution and Seven and we stepped up our 
investment in sales staff during the year and we plan to 
recruit more sales people in 2011.  Products  The StatPro Revolution service is a powerful 
cloud-based service with rich functionality. It comprises 
two main parts; the first is a database of over 500,000 
assets with historic prices, together with thousands of 
benchmarks and investment classifications; the second 
is that it has an integrated suite of portfolio analytics 
including performance, attribution and risk together 
with reporting, publishing and research.
It is possible for a client to upload the historic 
positions in a portfolio and then see the portfolio’s 
performance, risk and attribution with full reporting 
in a few minutes. As an online service, it is accessible 
immediately from any location with internet access. 
We believe one of the biggest business benefits of the 
service will prove to be the ability to share the analysis. 
A client can “invite” an investor or colleague to see his 
portfolio and so share it. This feature will be of great use 
between professional investors such as a mutual fund 
manager and an independent financial adviser (“IF A”) or 
between asset managers and pension fund clients. As 
all the data is in one database and is shared rather than 
exchanged, the use and access of data is greatly simplified.
StatPro Revolution is priced at $100 per portfolio, per 
month for 100 users and is therefore extremely economic. 
A company with 20 portfolios can have up to 2,000 users 
for just $2,000 a month with no limit on the number of 
people who can access the published reports.
Through the course of 2011 we plan to add many 
additional features and continue to expand the database. 
S t r a t e g y 		We have three target markets: our existing 
clients, distributors and online sales. 
For our existing clients, who tend to be the larger 
asset managers, we have now built links between 
StatPro Revolution and StatPro Seven. This will enable 
our existing StatPro Seven clients to easily integrate 
with StatPro Revolution, bringing them considerable 
benefits. Many clients have a problem reconciling 
front and back office performance results because 
the systems are not integrated. The back office role 
is to produce the statement of record, and the front 
office team often prefers analysis provided by separate 
terminal-based solutions. With StatPro Revolution, it is 
now possible to achieve both as the service provides 
the sort of analysis required by portfolio managers but 
can use the information produced by the back office.
We are also focusing on building a network of distributors 
for StatPro Revolution. Our first such distributor is RBC 
Dexia Investment Services (“RBCD”) who plan to use a 
white-labelled version of StatPro Revolution to provide 
portfolio analytics to their many clients. RBCD now has 
the most sophisticated portfolio analytics service of 
any custodian and can implement a new client almost 
immediately. The technology of Revolution is ideal for 
custodian banks as they do not have to manage any 
complicated IT platform or worry about installing a client. 
Other potential distributors are market data vendors 
and software companies. There are many companies 
especially in the back office that have strong client 
positions in different markets. As they have the clients’ 
portfolio data, adding StatPro Revolution to their product 
suite is a relatively easy task for them which will add great 
value to their services. We are marketing this to a wide 
range of companies in many parts of the world.
Finally, there is the online market. Our research shows that 
there are at least 25,000 companies that have $1.0 billion 
or less under management. The rapid development of the 
BRIC (Brazil, Russia, India and China) economies and other 
markets, means that there will soon be many more asset 
managers in this category. South Africa is a compelling 
example of the rapid growth of an asset management 
industry in strongly growing economies. In 2000 there 
was approximately $100 billion under management in 
South Africa, growing in just ten years to over $1 trillion.  
The obvious way for such newly established businesses in 
these markets to access portfolio analytics is via an online 
service providing a lower initial price point and scalability 
to easily expand the use of the service as they grow. Our 
challenge lies in making people aware that our service 
exists and ensuring that we progressively cover more data 
that is useful for each market.
People  StatPro employs around 250 people in 10 
offices around the world. I would like to thank every 
one of them for their contribution to StatPro over the 
last year. We are all looking forward to 2011 and the 
exciting challenges that lie ahead.
Dividend  In line with our policy of paying a progressive 
dividend that balances our investment needs with return 
to investors, we are pleased to announce an increase in 
our dividend to 2.4p from 2.1p in 2009.
Outlook  StatPro is a robust business operating in a 
growth market. The steady recurring revenue from our 
core business provides great stability for StatPro and allows 
us to invest with confidence. Our accumulated expertise 
in portfolio analytics makes us a business with rare skills 
and the technology of Revolution, based on the best 
SaaS initiatives, provides us with an exciting opportunity 
for future growth. For these reasons, although we cannot 
be sure of economic conditions or other factors, we are 
looking forward to the rest of 2011 and beyond.
Justin Wheatley
Chief Executive
25 March 2011  StatPro Revolution
    Equity Attribution Overview   Overview  The Board continues to strive to achieve a 
good balance between investing for top line growth 
while delivering an acceptable profit margin.  In 2010, 
StatPro made a significant increase in investment 
in the business whilst continuing to deliver a solid 
EBITDA margin and achieving revenue growth of 
5% to £33.13 million (2009: £31.56 million). Adjusted 
EBITDA was marginally lower at £8.45 million (2009: 
£8.63 million) but nevertheless was still above 25% 
margin and this was achieved whilst increasing our 
spending on research and development from £3.83 
million to £5.40 million, predominantly relating to 
an increase in expenditure on StatPro Revolution 
and cloud technology.  We also increased our capital 
expenditure on property, plant and equipment to 
£0.94 million (2009: £0.79 million).  We continue to 
focus on good operating cash management and we 
achieved a significant reduction in net debt from 
£8.89 million to £5.52 million.
Key performance indicators for the business
The key performance indicators (“KPIs”) that are 
monitored by the Board, and by the Group Executive 
Board as part of the regular monthly management 
reporting, are highlighted below. The KPIs are 
discussed in detail in the relevant sections of this 
Financial Review.
Revenue  Group revenue increased by 5% (2009: 13%) 
to £33.13 million (2009: £31.56 million). We achieved 
growth in revenue in the EMEAA region of 10%  
(2009: 16%) whilst revenue in the North American 
region fell by 3% (2009: 9% growth), mainly due to 
lower data fees. 
Key performance indicators for the business 2010 2009
C lien t	r ela t ed	KPI s
New sales of recurring licences and data £3.40 million £3.47 million
New sales of consulting £2.28 million £2.12 million

Adjusted operating margin 22.3% 24.7%
Adjusted EBITDA £8.45 million £8.63 million
Net debt £5.52 million £8.89 million
* at constant currency and excludes disposal Software licence revenue grew by 8% to £26.40 million 
(2009: £24.40 million) while, as expected, data fees 
reduced by 12% to £4.45 million (2009: £5.04 million) 
following the expiration in late 2009 of some legacy 
data contracts.  The level of professional services 
revenues increased by 8% to £2.28 million (2009: £2.12 
million). At constant currency (i.e. using 2009 average 
exchange rates), total revenue in 2010 would have 
been approximately £32.11 million (an increase of 2%).  
 
Recurring revenue  The Group’s business model of 
Software as a Service (“SaaS”) and recurring revenue 
contracts continues to provide excellent visibility of 
revenue with the recurring revenue element being a 
high percentage (93%) of total revenue (2009: 93%). 
The annualised recurring revenue from software 
licences and data fees at the end of December 2010 
was £29.38 million (2009: £28.12 million at constant 
currency and excluding disposal). New contracts signed 
in the year amounted to £3.40 million (2009: £3.47 
million) and the renewal rate increased to 92% (2009: 
90%).  We also made further progress on our SaaS 
strategy by adding 44 new clients for StatPro Seven in 
the year and achieving 30% by revenue of our software 
clients now being on the SaaS platform (2009: 20%).  
Approximately 63% of new recurring contracted 
revenue arose from existing clients (2009: 56%).
The proportion by value of recurring software 
licences and data clients at the end of 2010 secured 
to the end of 2011 or beyond increased to 84% 
(2009: 81%); due to the profile of renewals beyond 
2011 the weighted average length of contracts 
committed was slightly lower than the prior year at 
18 months (2009: 20 months).  
O p er a ting	e xp enses		Operating expenses (before 
amortisation of intangibles and exceptional items) 
increased by 7% to £23.48 million (2009: £21.91 
million), although at constant exchange rates 
the increase in expenditure was only 3%.  The 
average number of employees increased by 2% 
to 248 (2009: 243) and we ended 2010 with 251 
employees (2009: 246).  
E x c e p t i o n a l 	 i te m s 	 	Following a strategic review 
in the second half of 2010, which reaffirmed the 
Board’s commitment to re-focusing the business on 
SaaS and cloud computing, the Board implemented 
a restructuring of non-core operations.  This resulted 
in an exceptional charge amounting to £0.96 
million in 2010; a further charge of approximately 
£0.24 million is anticipated to be incurred in 2011. 
The charges relate principally to redundancy costs 
and onerous leases and the cash outflow in 2010 
amounted to £0.14 million.

The split of revenue for the year by type was as follows:
The analysis of revenue by region was as follows: Following the disposal of non-core software and related 
services under the JSE contract in the first half of 2010 for 
a total cash amount of £2.50 million, the Company made 
an exceptional gain on the software element of £0.50 
million being the difference between the cash received 
for the software element (£1.10 million) and the carrying 
value and associated costs of the software (£0.60 million). 
A djust ed	op er a ting	pr ofit	mar gin		As a result 
of increased investment in our products and 
the exceptional charges described above, the 
operating profit reduced in 2010 to £6.33 million 
(2009: £7.10 million). The adjusted operating profit 
reduced by 5% year on year to £7.39 million (2009: 
£7.79 million) as shown in note 3, with the adjusted 
operating profit margin reducing to 22.3% (2009: 
24.7%). The adjusted EBITDA (note 3) fell by 2% to 
£8.45 million (2009: £8.63 million).
 
R e s e a r c h 	 a n d 	 d e v e l o p m e n t 	 a n d 	 c a p e x 	 	In 2010, 
total research and development expenditure amounted 
to £5.40 million, an increase of 41% (2009: £3.83 million) 
and equating to 16% of Group revenue (2009: 12%) 
as we increased our expenditure on SaaS and cloud 
computing and, in particular, StatPro Revolution. The 
total cash expenditure on StatPro Revolution including 
marketing and other costs incurred in 2010 amounted 
to £2.19 million, which had a profit impact in the year 
of approximately £1.10 million after the impact of the 
capitalisation of development costs.  In the light of the 
successful beta launch of StatPro Revolution in 2010, 
the Board approved additional cash expenditure to a 
level of around £4.0 million per annum for development, 
support infrastructure and marketing in this area during 
the course of 2011.  
Of the total spend incurred on R&D (including 
purchased software), £3.46 million was capitalised 
(2009: £2.19 million). Amortisation (excluding 
amortisation of acquired intangibles) also increased 
to £2.38 million (2009: £1.96 million). Total capital 
expenditure on property plant and equipment, 
which relates predominantly to investments in data 
centres and related equipment, increased to £0.94 
million (2009: £0.79 million).  
F inanc e	inc ome	and	e xp ense		Net finance 
expense reduced to £0.71 million (2009: £0.89 million 
before exceptional item) as a result of lower overall 
net debt. The exceptional item in 2009 amounting to 
£1.16 million included within financing income was 
the pre-tax gain on refinancing. 
P r ofit	b ef or e	tax		Profit before taxation in 
2010 decreased by 24% to £5.62 million as a 
result of exceptional items (2009: £7.37 million). 
After adjusting for amortisation of acquired and 
purchased intangibles, share based payments and 
exceptional items, the adjusted profit before taxation 
reduced by 3% to £6.68 million (2009: £6.90 million). 
The impact of currency movements, which was not 
material, increased profit before taxation by £0.08 
million (i.e. less than 2% impact).  
T a x a t i o n 	 	The tax charge amounted to £1.46 
million (2009: £1.81 million) giving an effective 
tax rate of 26% (2009: 25%).  The Group has 
utilised further tax losses in the year and therefore 
continues to move towards a full tax charge.  Whilst 
the cash tax remains lower than the charge, there 
was nevertheless a significant increase in the tax 
paid over the prior year with the UK companies 
operating under the quarterly instalment regime. 
Earnings	p er	shar e		Basic earnings per share 
decreased by 27% to 6.8p (2009: 9.3p). Diluted 
earnings per share decreased to 6.6p (2009: 9.1p) 
based on potentially dilutive shares outstanding 
amounting to 1.58 million (2009: 1.42 million).  
Adjusted earnings per share (note 10) reduced by 
7% to 8.4p (2009: 9.0p).

Renewal rate 92% 90% B alanc e	S heet		The Group’s net assets increased to 
£43.72 million at 31 December 2010 (2009: £37.59 
million).  This increase was mainly as a result of the 
net profits attributable to equity shareholders of 
£4.13 million, and net exchange gains (principally 
related to revaluation of goodwill) through reserves 
amounting to £3.89 million.   
N on- c on tr olling	in t er est		StatPro exercised its 
option to acquire the non-controlling interest in 
SiSoft in June 2010 for an estimated contingent 
consideration of approximately £1.3 million and 
our estimate has not changed, but as the vendors 
are disputing certain aspects of the valuation, 
the process has not been completed in 2010 as 
expected. In January 2011, a legal process in the 
French Commercial Court was commenced to try 
to resolve the matter and formally complete the 
acquisition.  It is probable that the matter will not 
be fully resolved during 2011 and we will provide a 
further update if the position changes materially or 
on the completion of the acquisition.
N on- curr en t	and	curr en t	assets		Net movement 
on goodwill amounting to £5.03 million (2009: £1.79 
million) relates to the estimate of the additional 
investment in SiSoft (£1.31 million) together with 
revaluation to year end exchange rates (£3.73 
million). The carrying value for goodwill arising on 
all acquisitions has been reviewed and there have 
been no impairments.  The level of current assets 
increased to £9.90 million (2009: £9.64 million 
excluding asset held for sale).  Trade debtors, the 
largest component of debtors, increased to £6.04 
million at the end of 2010 (2009: £5.40 million) 
following an increase in new business signed 
in December 2010.  The level of cash and cash 
equivalents reduced to £1.76 million (2009: £2.37 
million) as surplus cash was used to minimise the 
amount drawn under our revolving credit facility.  
C urr en t	and	non- curr en t	liabilities		The largest 
component of current and non-current liabilities 
was deferred income, a non-cash liability, which 
increased by 9% to £13.76 million (2009: £12.60 
million). The other main movements in creditors 
related to a reduction in trade and other payables, 
an increase in contingent consideration, an increase 
in provisions (following the restructuring) and 
reductions in the bank loan.  
 
C ash	flo w	and	financing		2010 was another year of 
solid cash generation and further improvement year 
on year, with cash inflow from operating activities 
(before exceptional payments) increasing by 5% 
to £10.66 million (2009: £10.15 million).  The net 
cash investment in acquisitions amounted to £0.33 
million during the year (2009: £0.93 million) relating 
to payments of contingent consideration on past 
acquisitions. The proceeds of share issues during the 
year amounted to £0.05 million (2009: £0.49 million), 
mainly related to employee share options and we 
paid a total of £0.49 million (2009: £0.30 million) 
related to net settlement of share options in order to 
minimise potential share dilution.  There was also a 
net outflow of £0.20 million related to buying back 
treasury shares.  Whilst increasing the dividend we 
have maintained a good level of dividend cover (free 
cash flow: cash dividends) of 3.4 times (2009: 5.6).
S har e	c apital	and	r eser v es		In 2010, 0.27 million 
shares were issued (2009: 1.21 million) and the 
issued share capital amounted to £0.61 million 
(2009: £0.61 million) representing 60.95 million 
shares of 1p nominal value (2009: 60.68 million). The 
Company purchased into treasury 475,000 shares 
at an average price of 107.7p and sold 250,000 
at 128p leaving a balance of 225,000 shares in 
treasury at 31 December 2010. As a result of these 
share transactions, the share premium account has 
increased to £17.18 million (2009: £16.91 million). 
Dividends  The directors are recommending a 
final dividend for 2010 of 1.7p per share (2009: 0.2p) 
making a total dividend for 2010 of 2.4p per share 
(2009: 2.1p).   It is intended to pay the final dividend 
on 25 May 2011 to all shareholders on the register 
at the close of business on 26 April 2011. Total 
dividends paid in 2010 amounted to £1.35 million 
(2009: £1.12 million). The Board intends to maintain 
a progressive dividend policy reflecting the balance 
between the investment needs of the business and 
the growth in underlying earnings per share, while 
maintaining a minimum cash dividend cover.
Principal risks and uncertainties  The principal 
business risks and uncertainties affecting the Group 
are identified on pages 33 to 35. For each category 
of risk, the directors have identified means by 
which the risk can be managed or reduced in a 
cost effective way, whilst accepting that some risks 
cannot be completely eliminated. Details of key 
financial risks are considered below.
Financial risk management  The current and 
projected financial risks of the Group are managed 
by the Group Finance team. The primary risk 
relates to financing facilities and this is mitigated 
by ensuring very tight control of cash and detailed 
forecasting of the business cash flows.  
The directors believe that the financial risk profile has 
reduced significantly following the refinancing in 
2009 and the improvement in trading and reduction 
in net debt over the last two years.  Whilst the Group 
still has net debt, the gearing is now 0.65 times 
adjusted EBITDA. Interest cover (adjusted EBITDA: net 
finance costs) increased to 11.9 times (2009: 9.7 times). Liquidity risk  The Group’s cash position is closely 
monitored with weekly updates from all overseas 
operations and daily updates of cash collected from 
customers.  Any aged debtor balance that is overdue 
is investigated to ascertain the reason and to resolve 
the situation promptly. Monitoring procedures for 
short term cash projections allow the Group Finance 
team to closely monitor the key liquidity and other 
financial ratios to ensure that there is sufficient 
liquidity in the business at all times and sufficient 
headroom in relation to the banking covenants.
Financing facilities  The Company retains its senior 
debt facility (currently amounting to £15.15 million) 
with RBS, which is committed to February 2014, 
subject to compliance with agreed covenants.  In 
2010, the Company agreed some amendments to 
the facility as follows:
• 	 The £7 million bullet repayment can now be repaid 
in whole or in part using the revolving credit facility 
(“RCF”); this allows greater flexibility in financing 
arrangements (previously the RCF needed to be 
fully repaid before repaying the bullet).  
• The Company voluntarily cancelled part of 
the RCF to reduce the facility to £6.15 million 
given our lower financing requirement, whilst 
maintaining considerable financial headroom. 
The Company also has a multi-currency working 
capital loan of £2.0 million.
At 31 December 2010, the Group had both cash 
and undrawn credit facilities (amounting to 
approximately £7.26 million) available to support its 
business operations and therefore the Board believes 
that the Group is well-positioned to manage the 
business risks in the current uncertain environment.
F o r e i g n 	 e x c h a n g e 	 r i s k 	 m a n a g e m e n t 	 	The Group 
is exposed to exchange rate fluctuations given that 
the majority of its revenue is non-sterling based. 
The Group also has a significant proportion of its 
costs in the same currencies as its revenues and 
therefore there is a reasonable degree of natural 
reduction in overall currency risk.  
All material foreign currency transaction exposures 
(i.e. sales and purchase contracts denominated in a 
different currency to the local reporting currency) are 
hedged through use of foreign exchange contracts 
as soon as the amount and timing of the exposure is 
identified with reasonable certainty. The Group’s policy 
is not to hedge profit and loss translation exposures.    
As part of our liability management, we have made 
use of currency swaps with a total principal value of 
approximately £5.5 million denominated in USD, CAD, 
and EUR, to create synthetic currency hedges in order 
to provide a partial hedge against movements in the 
fair value of investments in overseas subsidiaries. As 
the Group continues to grow and generates increased 
profits overseas in foreign currencies this exchange 
rate exposure is expected to increase.  
I n t e r e s t 	 r a t e 	 r i s k 	 m a n a g e m e n t 	 	The Group is 
exposed to interest rate risk as a result of the debt 
in the business although the lower gearing has 
reduced this risk. An increase in interest rates would 
increase the interest payable on the Group’s banking 
facility.  The Company has in place an interest rate cap 
expiring in February 2012 on a notional £10 million 
of debt at a strike price of 3% (based on 3 month 
GBP LIBOR), which the Board believes provides a cost 
effective way of benefiting from currently low interest 
rates whilst protecting the Company from future 
potential adverse interest rate movements. 
The risk to rising interest rates would be partly 
mitigated by an increase in interest income from 
surplus cash and deposits, where the policy is to 
seek to maximise interest return without exposure to 
inappropriate liquidity or counterparty risk.

25 March 2011  Overview  StatPro has a strong footprint in North 
America employing around 90 people in three 
offices in Boston, Toronto and Montréal. These 
offices support a growing demand from the US 
and Canadian markets, as well as global markets 
being serviced by the rest of the Group. The North 
American regional revenue contribution to StatPro 
Group is around 35% (2009: 38%). Profitability was 
down in the year due to lower data revenue and 
increased investment in new products.
The North American Board (“NAB”) is responsible 
for implementing our regional strategy as well as 
day-to-day management of the region. The NAB 
meets every month to review performance and 
discuss operating matters.
T he	Re v olution	b egins	with	the	signing	of	
a global custodian  We are very excited about 
our launch of StatPro Revolution (a cloud-based 
portfolio analytics platform), with RBC Dexia Investor 
Services recently signing up for this service.  We 
expect to leverage our existing relationships with 
asset managers in North America to promote 
StatPro Revolution.  Additionally, there is a large 
market in the Americas for direct subscription for 
portfolio analytics over the web.  It is therefore very 
encouraging to see a healthy increase in StatPro 
Revolution trial accounts from the Americas. 
B alanc ed	S c or ec ar d	appr oach	t o	S tr a t egy	
I mplemen ta tion		During 2010, we adopted the 
Balanced Scorecard methodology to strategy 
planning and execution. This helps us align each and 
every individual in our operations to a single focus: 
to be an innovative provider of portfolio analytics 
and valuation solutions.
SAS70- c omplian t	Da ta	and	H ost ed	S of t w ar e	
Platform  We now have around 53% by revenue 
(2009: 45%) of our software clients in the North 
American region on the Software as a Service 
(“SaaS”) platform and our focus is to increase this 
throughout 2011. To that end, we continue to 
invest time and money into additional data centre 
infrastructure and accreditations to ensure that our 
SaaS backbone is of the highest quality. We expect 
to have our data and hosted software platform 
certified as SOC 2 under the new SSAE 16 standard 
which replaces the SAS70 in mid 2011. 
S ta t e - of -the -ar t	C o -lo c a tion	Da ta	C en tr e
Maintaining the confidentiality, integrity and 
availability of our clients’ data is of paramount 
importance to StatPro and our hosted platform.  
We recently made a strategic decision to move our 
Toronto and Montréal on-site data centres to the Bell 
co-location data centre in Toronto. Montréal remains 
our disaster recovery site.  StatPro Revolution and 
StatPro Unlimited are in place in the new data 
centre, as are our SAS70-compliant SaaS systems for 
new clients.  Over the next few months our existing 
clients hosted in our on-site Toronto data centre will 
be transitioned to the new infrastructure. The Bell 
data centre is a top tier facility and this move will 
help us achieve even higher levels of service and 
allow us to grow with our clients’ needs.
G lobal	Hub	f or	E v alua t ed	Da ta	O p er a tions
In addition to housing a SaaS Data Centre, Montréal 
is also the global hub of our StatPro Unlimited 
operations. In utilising industry best practices 
such as ITIL (Information Technology Infrastructure 
Library), we are able to create, maintain and 
distribute data on a large scale while meeting 
the strict deadlines imposed by such time-critical 
information. All of the data supplied to the 
StatPro Revolution and StatPro Seven products, 
as well as to our data-only clients, is produced by 
the Montréal Data Operations team, working in 
conjunction with the Milan team.
People  All of these activities and initiatives are 
only possible with a dedicated and experienced 
staff.   We’re fortunate that our people are passionate 
about StatPro and our business.  I’d like to take this 
opportunity to thank everyone in the region for their 
hard work in 2010.

S ta tP r o	N or th	A meric a Overview  Within the EMEAA region, StatPro has 
5 European offices located in London, Paris, Milan, 
Frankfurt and Luxembourg. There are around 100 
people that work in these offices performing local 
sales, service and support to our clients across 
Europe. Within the region we develop our risk and 
complex asset pricing services and our new cloud-
based portfolio analytics platform, Revolution.
Our Cape Town office is where StatPro’s other 
analytics products are developed and tested and 
as a result it is our largest with 54 people. In South 
Africa we are proud to have 3 of the 4 largest 
custodian banks and the 20 top asset managers in 
the country as clients.
In Australia our 6 person team looks after all our local 
clients as well as clients spread across Asia. We will 
be looking to open an office in Asia early in 2012.
The teams in the EMEAA region collectively manage 
around 65% of the Group’s revenue.
2010  We signed many new clients to our StatPro 
Seven service in 2010 and we implemented them 
in a remarkably short time-frame as a result of our 
Software as a Service strategy. Some of these new 
clients were smaller asset managers who were able 
to benefit from StatPro Seven’s per portfolio pricing 
which provides a low cost of entry. 
The total cost of ownership of StatPro Seven is much 
lower than the old style installed products offered 
by other vendors, and many of our clients recognise 
the benefits of converting to StatPro’s Hosting 
Services and we now have around 21% of our clients 
benefitting from Software as a Service and we 
expect many more to be converting in 2011. 
We also recruited a new European Sales Director in 
2010, Ruggero Frisina, and he is building up the sales 
team to drive Revolution and Seven sales in 2011.
ISO	27001	I nf orma tion	S ecurit y	M anagemen t
As a Software as a Service provider, protecting client 
data and maintaining uptime of hosted servers in 
our London docklands data centre is paramount. We 
achieved accreditation to the ISO 27001 standard for 
Information Security Management in 2008 and have 
continued to improve our processes at each annual 
reassessment and audit. 
S t a t P r o 	 R e v o l u t i o n 		We get positive feedback each 
time we demonstrate our stunning new StatPro 
Revolution product. Now the service is live, we already 
have clients, in various corners of the globe, analysing 
their portfolios by subscribing to Revolution. Again, 
these are new clients from a completely different 
market segment to our existing clients creating a 
superb growth opportunity for the Group.
Our existing clients are showing high levels of 
interest in Revolution as well given that they can 
load their portfolios’ weights and returns from the 
traditional products directly into Revolution and 
thereby offer their end customers an enhanced 
interactive web reporting and distribution service.
We shall be launching StatPro Revolution in the UK 
at a prestigious London venue on the 18 May 2011 
at which time we hope to welcome clients and 
many other interested parties to the event.
People  At StatPro, we continually invest in the 
development of people through both internal 
and external training courses. This enables us to 
offer better informed service and support to our 
clients and in 2010 we successfully passed our 
re-assessment of the Investors in People standard, 
and I would like to thank all staff in the region for 
their efforts in 2010.

S ta tP r o	EMEAA  T he	Re v olution	c on tinues		The product strategy
for 2011 continues to be dominated by StatPro 
Revolution. Our aim with Revolution is to create a 
platform where the owners and managers of money 
can share analytics information in real time thus 
increasing transparency and communication as well as 
helping to fulfil regulations with the minimum of fuss. 
The technology leap makes possible what previously 
was not. Rather than sending information to each 
other and duplicating it and creating silos of dead 
information, Revolution allows instant access without 
duplication keeping information easy, open and fresh.
The Revolution platform brings together
three key elements:
- state-of-the-art technology;
- data;
- analytics and financial expertise.
StatPro has years of experience and expertise with 
analytics and by leveraging the undoubted power 
and ease of use of the Internet, Revolution brings 
exciting new functionality to our clients. Over the last 
three years an enormous amount has been achieved 
by our development team to deliver the first live 
version of the service. There remain many exciting 
projects and challenges for the year ahead which will 
boost the quality and benefits of Revolution.
Exp er t	Da ta	I n t egr a tion		Revolution already 
contains good fixed income coverage, but there are 
ongoing projects that will dramatically boost the 
capacity of coverage in this area.
In 2011 Revolution will become a multiple-source 
platform in the fixed income space. We are opening 
partnerships with third-party data providers who will 
be able to distribute their fixed income information, 
such as prices, corporate actions, and risk numbers. 
Revolution users will be able to build a price hierarchy 
to analyse their portfolios, choosing the preferred 
sources in the desired priority.
At the same time, we are implementing a 
sophisticated process that will leverage the 
quantitative expertise accumulated in the risk 
management operations. Our risk solution 
today offers the widest coverage in the industry, 
extending its reach to about 300 different types of 
pricing functions. The simple idea is to transfer this 
breadth of coverage inside Revolution, making the 
platform able to cover any potential fixed income 
instrument that clients may have.
Part of this development is the production of risk 
numbers such as Yield to Maturity (“YTM”), modified 
duration, and convexity. During 2011, with one simple 
enhancement we will be able to provide option-
adjusted risk numbers for any fixed income asset 
class already covered in the risk service. This means 
that we will produce and integrate inside Revolution 
reliable and unique option-adjusted risk figures for 
instruments like floating rate notes, convertible bonds, 
mortgage-backed securities, constant-maturity swaps, 
range accruals, and similar instruments.
F i n a l i s i n g 	 t h e 	 I n f r a s t r u c t u r e 		During 2011 we will 
see the completion of the main components of our 
technology infrastructure. A report writer is already 
in place and will be soon followed by an information 
distribution system, available under the “Publish” tab of 
Revolution. This component empowers the users to 
manage the reporting workflow, organising centrally the 
distribution of reports and information on portfolios.
The integration of billing systems and the StatPro Shop 
will allow us to leverage our online marketing capabilities 
and extend our commercial reach around the world. 
N ot	O nly	Re v olution		While Revolution is certainly 
the biggest development we have, there are other 
exciting plans for our other products. StatPro Seven 
will bring to market an integrated interface for our 
expert production system for the middle office, 
incorporating several improvements including a 
new messaging system and StatPro Unlimited now 
provides not only valuations, but a fresh array of new 
data, including risk numbers at individual asset level 
and “Greeks” for any instrument.
2011 will be the year that StatPro shows the benefits from 
the combination of our data and our software expertise.
Dario	C in tioli
Product Director 
25 March 2011 Although it is a cliché, this time it is true: we live in 
rapidly changing times.  The internet is opening up 
new markets and opportunities that would have 
seemed impossible just a few years ago.  StatPro 
Revolution is a pure cloud-based internet offering 
which is perfectly suited to take advantage of such 
opportunities on a global scale.  Marketing such a 
revolutionary product requires a new approach, a 
new way of thinking.  StatPro is leveraging the power 
of the internet to launch and promote Revolution to 
a global audience while still engaging prospects and 
clients locally with launch and workshop events in 
many cities around the world.  
There are many ways of reaching new markets and 
spreading the core message of StatPro Revolution.  
Our strategy is to initiate several streams of activity to 
promote Revolution and track these to understand 
the value of each stream in fine detail.  This tracking 
of marketing activity using new methods and tools 
provides rapid feedback on the success of individual 
campaigns and allows the business to focus on what 
is yielding the most new business.
There are so many new ways of engaging people in 
today’s digital economy.  Companies like Facebook 
have shown in spectacular fashion how people want 
to stay connected with each other.  (Apparently, if 
Facebook were a country it would be the third most 
populated country on earth behind China and India 
with over 500 million users).  Understanding how 
people communicate with each other and show 
an interest in a product is key to getting it in front 
of the largest audience possible.  StatPro is working 
with several specialist partners to ensure Revolution 
is positioned in the right places to the right people 
who are looking for portfolio analysis solutions.  
Creating high quality, targeted content that is 
optimised for search engines and promoted through 
many channels is just one of dozens of methods to 
promote inbound marketing that leads to sales.  
StatPro Revolution is free for users to test and our 
strategy is to attract as many people as possible 
to the service in this way so they can see for 
themselves the enormous business benefits of 
a cloud based portfolio analysis and distribution 
system.  Our mission is to put Revolution on the 
screen of every portfolio manager.  From there, 
Revolution will hopefully sell itself and, if you open a 
trial account at http://www.statpro.com/revolution, 
you will understand what we mean.

Principal activity
The principal activity of the Company and its subsidiaries during the year was the development, marketing and distribution of software 
systems and the provision of web-based portfolio analysis and asset pricing services to the global asset management industry. 
Review of business and future developments
The directors are pleased with the performance of the Group, which has achieved further growth in revenue, and a solid level of profits 
and cash flow in a year with a considerable increase in investment in the business. A review of the business and likely future developments 
is contained in the Chairman’s Statement on page 6 and Chief Executive’s Review on pages 9 and 10.
Principal risks and uncertainties
The Group operates in the asset management sector of the financial services industry and, whilst many of our clients are part of banking 
groups, most of our clients are relatively resilient to the challenging economic backdrop. This is because, like StatPro itself, they themselves 
have recurring revenue models and to a large extent, the services and software provided by StatPro are reasonably embedded within their 
core operations. 
The Board closely monitors clients that are potentially at risk as well as the pipeline of new business. We plan for a level of cancellations 
each year but most of our contracts are multi-year agreements which roll into subsequent commitments unless written notice is given 
to terminate the contract. For software service contracts the annual licence fee is payable in advance and for data contracts the fees are 
monthly in advance. For these reasons, we have good visibility on any potential deterioration in our trading outlook and potential liquidity 
risks to the business.
The Group has both cash and undrawn credit facilities available to support its business operations and therefore the Board believes that 
the Group is well-positioned to manage the business risks in the current uncertain environment.
The principal risks and uncertainties that affect the Group are identified on pages 33 to 35.
Financial risk management
The principal financial risks that the Group is exposed to and the approach to risk management are described in the Financial Review on 
pages 16 to 17.
Going concern
After making appropriate enquiries, the directors have a reasonable expectation that the Group has adequate resources to continue 
in operational existence for the foreseeable future. For these reasons, they continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the 
Group’s financial statements.
Research and development 
The Group continues to invest in developing improved software products and services. Development expenditure incurred during the year 
was £5.40 million (2009: £3.83 million). In accordance with IFRS, development costs are capitalised where recognition criteria are met and 
written off over the useful life, currently estimated by the directors at three years. The amount capitalised in the year was £3.21 million (2009: 
£2.19 million) and the total amount of amortisation of internally generated development expenditure was £2.34 million (2009: £1.96 million). 
R e s u l t s , 	 d i v i d e n d s 	 a n d 	 t r a n s f e r s 	 t o 	 r e s e r v e s
The Group’s profit attributable to equity shareholders for the financial year was £4.13 million (2009: £5.57 million). A final dividend of 
1.7p per ordinary share (2009: 0.2p) has been recommended by the directors taking the total dividend for the year to 2.4p (2009: 2.1p). If 
approved by the passing of a resolution at the 2011 Annual General Meeting, it is intended to pay the final dividend on 25 May 2011 to all 
shareholders on the register at close of business on 26 April 2011 (ex-div date will be 20 April 2011). A second interim dividend for 2009 of 
1.3p per ordinary share was paid in March 2010. The profit for the year has been transferred to reserves.
S h a r e s 	 i s s u e d 	 i n 	 y e a r
During 2010 the Company issued 273,291 shares (2009: 1,209,489) as detailed in note 20 to the financial statements. Also, net purchases of 
treasury shares resulted in 225,000 shares being held in treasury at 31 December 2010 (2009: nil). At the forthcoming Annual General Meeting, 
the directors are seeking to renew the authority to allow the purchase of own shares up to a limit of 10% of the Company’s share capital.
Post balance sheet events
There have been no post balance sheet events. Donations
The Group made charitable donations for educational purposes of £33,000 (2009: £23,000) during the year, the main component of which 
related to scholarships and sponsorships to students from disadvantaged backgrounds to various educational establishments in South 
Africa. No political donations (2009: nil) were made during the year.
Directors and their interests
The directors who held office during the year were:
CR Bacon Non-executive Chairman
JMBT Wheatley Group Chief Executive
AM Fabian Group Finance Director
MC Fairbairn Non-executive Director
MC Adorian Non-executive Director
SJ Clark Non-executive Director
All directors are subject to election at the first opportunity after their appointment, and to re-election thereafter at intervals of no more 
than three years in accordance with the Company’s Articles of Association. The Company’s Articles of Association require that one third 
of the directors, or the number nearest to one third, are to retire from office by rotation. Accordingly, CR Bacon and JMBT Wheatley seek 
re-election at the forthcoming Annual General Meeting. 
Directors’ interests in the Company’s share capital and share options are detailed on page 42.
D i r e c t o r s ’ 	 i n t e r e s t s 	 i n 	 s i g n i fi c a n t 	 c o n t r a c t s
Directors’ interests in significant contracts are described in note 21 to the financial statements.
Policy and practice on payment of creditors
The Group recognises the importance of good relationships with its suppliers and sub-contractors and has established the following 
payment policy:
(a)  agree payment terms in advance of any commitment being entered into;
(b)  ensure suppliers are made aware of these terms by inclusion of the terms of payment on the purchase order or the contract;
(c)  ensure that payments are made in accordance with the terms of the contract or order providing that the presented documentation 
is complete and accurate.
The number of days purchases outstanding at 31 December 2010 for the Group was 28 days (2009: 51) and for the parent Company was 
33 days (2009: 40).
S t a t e m e n t 	 o f 	 d i r e c t o r s ’ 	 r e s p o n s i b i l i t i e s
The directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report, the Directors’ Remuneration Report and the financial statements in 
accordance with applicable law and regulations. 
Company law requires the directors to prepare financial statements for each financial year. Under that law the directors have elected to 
prepare the Group and parent Company financial statements in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as 
adopted by the European Union. Under company law the directors must not approve the financial statements unless they are satisfied that 
they give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the Group and the Company and of the profit or loss of the Group for that period. In 
preparing these financial statements, the directors are required to:
• 	 select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently;
• 	 make judgements and accounting estimates that are reasonable and prudent;
• 	 state whether applicable IFRSs as adopted by the European Union have been followed, subject to any material departures disclosed 
and explained in the financial statements;
• 	 prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis unless it is inappropriate to presume that the Company will continue in business. The directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting records that are sufficient to show and explain the Company’s transactions 
and disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position of the Company and the Group and enable them to ensure that 
the financial statements and the Directors’ Remuneration Report comply with the Companies Act 2006. They are also responsible for 
safeguarding the assets of the Company and the Group and hence for taking reasonable steps for the prevention and detection of fraud 
and other irregularities.
The directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity of the Company’s website. Legislation in the United Kingdom governing 
the preparation and dissemination of financial statements may differ from legislation in other jurisdictions. 
Directors’ indemnity insurance
The Company carries an appropriate level of professional indemnity insurance cover for the size of the business and also has insurance 
cover for Directors’ and Officers’ liability.
Disclosure of information to auditors
Each director has confirmed that:
• 	 so far as the director is aware, there is no relevant audit information of which the Group’s auditors are unaware, and
• 	 he has taken all the steps that he ought to have taken as a director in order to make himself aware of any relevant audit information 
and to establish that the Group’s auditors are aware of that information.
This confirmation is given in accordance with Section 418 of the Companies Act 2006.
S u b s t a n t i a l 	 s h a r e h o l d i n g s

The Group acknowledges the vital role that all employees play in its success through their skills, initiative and commitment. All operations 
are encouraged to provide the proper resources to maximise this potential through efficient systems of recruitment, communication, 
training and development. It is the Group’s policy to give full and fair consideration to the employment and career development of 
disabled persons, commensurate with their aptitudes and abilities. The Group’s policy in respect of staff who become disabled whilst 
employed is to seek to train and assist them wherever possible to continue employment within the Group. The Group is also committed 
to providing equal opportunities regardless of age, gender, religion or ethnic origin.
The Group ensures that all employees are kept fully informed, as far as it is practicable, with regard to the activities of the Group, by 
circulation of news and regular meetings between directors, managers and other employees. The London office of StatPro, the Group’s 
head office and base of UK operations, retains its Investors in People (“IIP”) award in recognition of the investment the Company has made 
in its people. The award demonstrates that we believe in and recognise the value of our staff, their performance and their contribution to 
the success of the business.  H e a l t h 	 a n d 	 S a f e t y
The Group’s policy is to ensure that, as far as is reasonably practicable, working environments exist which will minimise risk to the health 
and safety of employees.
Legal form
The Company is a public limited company, incorporated and domiciled in England and Wales. The Company’s Registration number is 2910629.
Auditors
During 2010, Ernst & Young LLP was appointed by the Board as independent auditor to the Group following a competitive tender. A 
resolution to re-appoint Ernst and Young LLP as independent auditor to the Company will be proposed at the Annual General Meeting.
By order of the Board
G F M T 	 W h e a t l e y 
C o m p a n y 	 S e c r e t a r y 
25 March 2011 The directors have evaluated the principal business risks and uncertainties affecting the Group, which are documented in a Group Risk 
Manual. Below is a summary of the principal business risks and uncertainties, together with mitigations in place, although it is not intended 
to be an exhaustive list. For each risk, the directors have identified means by which its impact could be reduced or controlled in a cost 
effective way, whilst accepting that some risks cannot be completely eliminated and there may be other risks to the business that we have 
not identified. The Group Executive Board actively monitors risk issues and reports regularly to the main Board on such matters, including 
progress on resolving risk issues.
S t r a t e g i c 
Risks M i t i g a t i o n s
Failure to identify market requirements 
and opportunities. Competitor products 
are developed that are superior to 
StatPro’s offering.
• The Group Executive Board (“GEB”) has regular meetings with Sales & Marketing, Client Services 
and Development teams to ensure that StatPro’s products and services meet market requirements 
and exploit market opportunities.
StatPro’s marketing and sales efforts may 
not lead to sufficient new business.
• The GEB has regular meetings between Sales and Client Services teams to exploit market 
intelligence and ensure that StatPro’s products and services meet clients’ needs and are not 
competitive in StatPro’s chosen market niches.
•  In addition to StatPro’s traditional marketing strategies such as event hosting and sponsorship, 
StatPro aims to use cost-effective online advertising tools to track and report interest in its 
products and services, thereby enabling a more effective and efficient marketing and sales effort.
Brand is not sufficiently well-known in 
the marketplace.
• StatPro actively promotes itself within the asset management industry by way of thought 
leadership, press releases, event sponsorship and appropriate sales and marketing campaigns.
Loss of good reputation. • Continual proactive account management to maintain good reputation and ensuring staff focus 
on commitment to providing high quality client services including addressing any shortfalls in a 
swift and transparent manner.
• Ensure good understanding of market’s and clients’ needs.
• Ensure good communications to Board of potential problems and quick resolution.
Technological change. • Continual proactive investment in latest technology and practices for code development 
combined with appropriate investment in hardware and software to ensure that we minimise 
the risk to changes in technology and obsolescence. We believe that our significant investment 
in research and development and progress in Software as a Service technology puts us at the 
leading edge of technology.
The market take-up of StatPro Revolution 
may not be as fast as expected.
• Given that StatPro is developing a new service (StatPro Revolution), it is difficult to estimate 
precisely the budget and cash flow impacts for current and future years.
• Once the current beta-testing period is complete and StatPro Revolution beta meets StatPro’s 
quality standards, StatPro Revolution will be released to subscription users and the marketing 
effort increased to drive subscription take-up. This staged approach will minimise any adverse 
impact on the StatPro brand of launching a new product. Operational 
Risks M i t i g a t i o n s
Failure to meet client expectations 
or contractual commitments when 
implementing products and services 
with a new client.
• All clients allocated an Account Manager to manage the client relationship and escalate any issues 
to director level.
• All client accounts closely monitored for satisfaction.
Failure to service clients in a timely 
manner, leading to dissatisfaction and 
ultimately cancelled or not-renewed key 
customer contracts.
• Regular monitoring and reporting of clients at risk and proactive account management by Client 
Services team who categorise and manage clients by their satisfaction with StatPro.
• The Group Executive Board (“GEB”) has regular meetings with Sales, Client Services and 
Development represented to ensure that StatPro meets client expectations.
• Long-term contracts foster client commitment.
Inability to recruit or retain high calibre 
management. Key staff or management 
leave, jeopardising StatPro’s ability to 
efficiently and effectively develop new 
products and functionality, win new 
business and service current clients.
• StatPro’s Investors in People accreditation helps senior management ensure that staff needs and 
aspirations are met within the organisations objectives and resources.
• Documenting of key procedures, e.g. under the ISO 27001 accreditation program, helps ensure 
that an institutional memory is created to capture and exploit key knowledge. 
Excessive staff turnover jeopardises 
StatPro’s ability to operate efficiently and 
effectively.
• Continual review of HR issues. Introduction of Balance Scorecard approach to team and 
individual evaluation.
• Recruitment planning and implementation.
• Implement appropriate remuneration schemes.
• Legal advice on employment law and contract.
Development delays or undetected 
errors in system code, poor design, and 
obsolescence.
• Continual investment in Development and Quality Assurance.
• Regular monitoring and reporting of Development project progress, quality and user acceptance 
testing of enhancements.
Data or hosting software delivery failure. • Outsourcing of data centres and back-up facilities to specialist data centre providers.
• Disaster recovery plans are in place and are regularly tested.
• Continual investment in appropriate technology to provide reasonable assurance of meeting high 
levels of service in line with Service Level Agreements.
• Back-up data providers in place so that we minimise risk to provision of pricing data to our clients 
in the event of failure by data supplier to deliver accurate data on time.
Financial 
Risks M i t i g a t i o n s
Liquidity risk. The Group is exposed to 
the risk that there is insufficient financing 
available for our day to day operations.
• The Group’s cash position is closely monitored as are key liquidity and other financial ratios to 
ensure that there is sufficient liquidity in the business at all times and sufficient headroom in 
relation to banking covenants.
• The Company has in place a committed banking facility with RBS currently amounting to £15.15 
million, which is available (the RCF element is available on an amortising basis), subject to 
compliance with covenants, to February 2014.
Currency risk. The Group operates 
internationally and therefore financial 
results are exposed to movements in the 
exchange rates of currencies, in particular 
the US Dollar and Euro, but also the 
Canadian Dollar, South African Rand and 
Australian Dollar.
• Client contracts are generally denominated in the currency of operation of the sales and support 
unit thereby creating a reasonable degree of natural hedging.
• All material currency transaction exposures are hedged through use of foreign exchange contracts.
• Use is made of currency swaps to create synthetic hedges against movements in the fair value of 
overseas investments.
Interest rate risk. The Group has net debt 
and therefore is exposed to movements 
of interest rates.
• The level of gearing has reduced significantly and the net debt amounts now to 0.65 x EBITDA.
• We have in place an interest rate cap covering a notional £10 million of debt which is capped at a 
LIBOR of 3% to February 2012. C o m p l i a n c e 
Risks M i t i g a t i o n s
Information systems or information 
security failure.
• ISO 27001 and SAS70 accreditation help ensure that the confidentiality, integrity and availability of 
information are preserved.
• Business Continuity and Disaster Recovery plans implemented and tested to help manage any 
business interruption events.
Loss of investor confidence / inability to 
raise finance.
• Regular communication with investors / financial advisors / brokers / communication consultants.
Non-compliance with applicable laws, 
regulations and best business practice to 
manage stakeholder expectations.
• Laws and regulations are monitored by relevant managers, assisted by external specialist input 
where required.
• Product specialists ensure that StatPro’s products comply with all relevant market regulations.
• The Group Finance Director manages banking relationships and, together with the Group CEO, 
manages the investor relations.
Inadequate insurance levels for business 
interruption, product liability, and 
professional indemnity.
• Insurance levels reviewed regularly and at least annually, in particular levels for professional 
indemnity insurance, director’s liability cover and key man insurance.
Lack of management control over 
acquisition/establishment of new 
companies/offices.
• Contracts structured to limit financial risk.
• Local management incentivised to ensure common goals and management approach.
Challenges to intellectual property 
rights. There is a risk that third parties will 
breach IP rights held by StatPro. There 
is also a risk that a third party alleges 
patent infringement or other breach of 
intellectual property rights by StatPro. 
Alleged IP breaches can be very expensive 
to defend even if there is apparently little 
ground for the claim because of the legal 
and technical complexities involved in 
asserting IP rights.
• Ensure adequate protection of our own IP is in place.
• Legal advice received on cost effective way to register trademarks and other IP rights in key markets.
• Ensure legal advice sought to ensure risk of potential IP infringement by StatPro is minimised.
Litigation relating to contractual client 
arrangement or employee contract.
• Ensure appropriate legal advice taken when any matter is likely to result in legal action. C o m p l i a n c e 	 w i t h 	 t h e 	 C o m b i n e d 	 C o d e
As the Company is listed on the Alternative Investment Market of the London Stock Exchange (“AIM”), the Company is not required to follow 
the Combined Code, which applies only to fully listed companies. Nevertheless, the Company is committed to high standards of corporate 
governance and the Board is accountable to the Company’s shareholders for good corporate governance. This statement describes how 
the principles of corporate governance are applied to the Company and the Company’s compliance with the Code provisions. Except as 
noted below, the Company has been in compliance with the provisions set out in the 2008 FRC Combined Code during the year.

The Board currently comprises the non-executive Chairman, the Group Chief Executive, the Group Finance Director and three other non-
executive directors and is responsible to shareholders for the proper management of the Group. Directors’ biographies appear on page 
24 and 25 and demonstrate a range of relevant experience bringing independent judgement to bear on issues of strategy, performance, 
resources, industry knowledge and standards of conduct, which is vital to the success of the Group. 
All directors have access to the Company Secretary, who is responsible for all company secretarial matters and compliance with relevant 
statutory obligations. All directors receive adequate training to enable them to comply with their duties as a director.
To enable the Board to discharge its duties, all directors have full and timely access to all relevant information. The Board meets at least 
quarterly and has adopted a formal schedule of matters specifically reserved for decision by it, thus ensuring that it exercises control over 
appropriate strategic, financial, operational and compliance issues. At these meetings the Board reviews trading performance, ensures 
adequate financing, sets and monitors strategy, examines investment and acquisition opportunities and discusses reports to shareholders. 
The directors can also take independent professional advice as appropriate at the Company’s expense. 
The Board has a process for evaluating the performance of each director. The performance of the executive directors is reviewed by the 
non-executive directors. The performance of the Chairman and each of the non-executive directors is reviewed on an individual basis by 
the other directors. The overall effectiveness of the Board and its sub-committees is reviewed by the Board as a whole through completion 
of a formal questionnaire. The following committees have been established to deal with specific aspects of the Group’s affairs.
A u d i t 	 C o m m i t t e e
The Audit Committee is chaired by Charles Fairbairn and also comprises the Chairman (Carl Bacon), Mark Adorian and Stuart Clark, and 
meets at least three times annually. The Audit Committee provides a forum for reporting by the Group’s external auditors. Meetings are 
also attended, by invitation, by the Group Finance Director. 
The Audit Committee is responsible for reviewing a wide range of financial matters, as set out in written terms of reference, including the 
interim results and the annual report and accounts before their submission to the Board and monitoring the controls which are in force 
to ensure the integrity of the financial information reported to shareholders. The Audit Committee reviews the appointment of external 
auditors and their remuneration both for audit and non-audit work and discusses the nature and scope of the audit. The Audit Committee 
regularly reviews the level of non-audit work being performed by the auditors to ensure that they remain independent and the Audit 
Committee is satisfied that the current level of non-audit work being performed by the auditors is appropriate.
The Audit Committee needs to assess annually the qualification, expertise and resources, and independence of the external auditors and 
the effectiveness of the audit process. In June 2010, as previously announced, Ernst & Young LLP were appointed by the Board as Auditor 
to the Group following a competitive tender process. The previous auditor, PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP , had been the Group’s auditors 
since April 2000.

The Remuneration Committee is responsible for determining the contract terms, remuneration and other benefits for executive directors, 
including performance-related bonus schemes and participation in the Group’s Long Term Incentive Scheme. Mark Adorian is the 
chairman of the Remuneration Committee and the other members are Charles Fairbairn, Carl Bacon and Stuart Clark, who was appointed 
to the committee on 1 July 2010.
The Remuneration Report, which includes details of directors’ remuneration, pension entitlements and directors’ interests, together with 
information on service contracts is set out on pages 39 to 42. 
Mark Adorian is the chairman of the Nominations Committee and the other members are Carl Bacon and Charles Fairbairn. The Nominations 
Committee undertakes the function of nominating appointments to the Board, although all such appointments are reviewed and 
approved by the full Board. There were six full scheduled Board meetings held in 2010. During the year there were three audit committee meetings, two remuneration 
committee meetings and there were no nominations committee meetings. The number of full scheduled Board meetings and main sub-

The Group Executive Board (“GEB”) is the executive committee, which comprises the executive directors together with other senior 
executives of the Group who meet at least ten times per annum to discuss strategic and operational matters. Regional executive boards 
and product focused committees have been established to deal with executive decisions, within clearly defined terms of reference 
established by the Board. 
The following changes to the composition of the GEB have occurred. In December 2010, Mark Bramley resigned from the Group Executive 
Board. With effect from 1 January 2011, two senior executives (Dario Cintioli and Neil Smyth) were promoted to the Group Executive Board. 
At the same time the roles and responsibilities of all GEB members were reviewed and are now as follows:
Justin Wheatley, Group Chief Executive
Andrew Fabian, Group Finance Director
S i m o n 	 J o h n s, CEO, EMEAA
Andrew Peddar, CEO, North America
M i c h e l 	 L e m p i c k i, Corporate Development Director
D a r i o 	 C i n t i o l i, Product Director
N e i l 	 S m y t h, Marketing and Technology Director
The Group Executive Board has the following sub-committees:

Operational decisions on implementing the Group’s strategy including sales and client services strategy, expenditure and recruitment 
plans are delegated to senior executives in the Group’s regions, within clearly defined terms of reference and overall budgets 
established by the Board. 
P r o d u c t 	 S t r a t e g y
Operational decisions on implementing the Group’s product strategy including development plans together with related expenditure 
and recruitment plans are delegated to the Product Director who works with other senior executives on product-focused committees, 
within clearly defined terms of reference and overall budgets established by the Board. 
Relations with shareholders
Communications with shareholders are given high priority. There is regular dialogue with institutional shareholders and market analysts 
including presentations after the Company’s preliminary announcement of the annual and interim results and other major announcements. 
I n t e r n a l 	 c o n t r o l s 	 a n d 	 r i s k 	 m a n a g e m e n t	
During the year, the Board has formally reviewed the Group’s risk profile and reported on the effectiveness of the Group’s system of internal 
controls and management of Group risk in accordance with the Combined Code. This review is required to address not only internal 
financial controls but other risks and controls of the business. The directors acknowledge that they are responsible for the Company’s 
system of internal control, which is designed to manage rather than eliminate business risks and which provides reasonable but not 
absolute assurance against material mis-statement or loss.  The Company has established risk management procedures, which the directors consider appropriate to a group of StatPro’s size and 
complexity, and during the year, the internal controls and risk management procedures were reviewed by the directors. This is achieved 
through a series of reports and meetings of specific committees including the Information Security Committee. The Company has a Group 
Risk Manual, which sets out the key risks by region and by function and the controls in place to manage the risks and identifies actions 
to be taken to improve risk management processes. The risk review process was enhanced during the year by the implementation of a 
new risk management framework which focuses on adopting enterprise wide risk management techniques on a consistent basis and 
improving risk reporting and management. Given the size and nature of the business the directors consider that the Group is compliant 
with the requirements of The Turnbull Report.
Each senior executive is responsible for managing risks in his or her region or function and making regular reports on risk issues to both 
the main Board and Group Executive Board. This risk analysis covers all business risks including commercial, financial, operational, legal 
and environmental risks. These reports include the potential impact to the business of each key risk and its likelihood. The Board is thus 
able to monitor the risk profile for all significant business risks. Recommendations on internal controls and risk improvement are reviewed 
by the Audit Committee and the Board. 
Risk awareness is further embedded within the business at a series of review meetings during the year extending to Group Executive Board 
and other directors and senior managers.
A statement of the directors’ responsibilities in respect of the financial statements is set out on pages 30 to 31 and a statement on going 
concern is below. 
Financial controls
The Group has established written expenditure approval, delegation of authority and authorisation levels, segregation of duties and other 
control procedures together with accounting policies and procedures, which are approved by the Board.
B u d g e t a r y 	 p r o c e s s	
Each year the Board approves the annual budget and key risk areas are identified. Performance is monitored and relevant action is taken 
throughout the year through regular reporting to the Board of variances from the budget, updated forecasts for the year together with 
information on the key risk areas.

Major capital and other project expenditure is controlled by a budgetary process and authorisation levels. For capital expenditure above 
specified levels, and for acquisitions and disposals, detailed written proposals have to be submitted to the Board for approval. 
I n t e r n a l 	 a u d i t	
The Group currently does not have an internal audit function as the directors consider this to be inappropriate given the current size 
of the Group. However, this situation is reviewed by the Board annually. An element of internal audit assurance is achieved by use of 
internal staff working on specific projects, for example, to review the policies and procedures relating to information security, including 
the effectiveness of related internal controls.
Going concern
After making appropriate enquiries and for the reasons set out in the directors’ report, the directors have a reasonable expectation that 
the Group has adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future. For this reason, they continue to adopt 
the going concern basis in preparing these financial statements.

25 March 2011 Mark Adorian is the chairman of the Remuneration Committee and the other members of the Committee are Charles Fairbairn, Carl 
Bacon and Stuart Clark, who was appointed to the committee on 1 July 2010. The remuneration of all executive directors and other senior 
executives is recommended to the Board by the Committee. The remuneration of the non-executive directors is determined by the Board. 
During the year the Committee has reviewed salary surveys and the policies of other companies of a comparable nature but has taken no 
external advice. 
Remuneration policy
The Group’s policy is to attract, retain and motivate high calibre executives by rewarding them with remuneration packages which 
reflect both individual performance and the results of the operations under their control. Packages consist of basic salary, benefits, share 
options, performance-related bonuses, pensions and other benefits, with a significant proportion of potential remuneration based upon 
achievement of demanding performance targets. Consideration is given to pay and employment policies elsewhere in the Group. Details 
of the remuneration package of each director are set out on page 41.
The Group has needed to have a remuneration policy to steer the Group towards the objectives of all its shareholders. The current focus is 
on the achievement of Group revenue growth and profit targets and bonuses will form a greater part of the overall remuneration package.
B a s i c 	 s a l a r y 	 a n d 	 b e n e fi t s
Salaries are established by reference to prevailing market rates, adjusted to reflect individual performance, experience, responsibilities and 
skills. In October 2010, Justin Wheatley relocated to Luxembourg to head up the Group’s StatPro Revolution operation and as a result of this 
Justin Wheatley signed a new service agreement with a Luxembourg subsidiary of the Group. The terms of the new agreement stipulated 
some flexibility within the remuneration package to swap salary and pension for other allowances within a total remuneration including 
pension and allowances of €330,000 per annum. 
With effect from 1 January 2011, the Remuneration Committee approved an increase to this remuneration package for Justin Wheatley 
to €395,000 to include salary, pension, accommodation and car allowances, but excluding any potential performance-related bonus. The 
Remuneration Committee approved an increase in basic salary for Andrew Fabian to £142,000 with effect from 1 January 2011. There were 
no changes to the fee arrangements for Non-Executive Directors.
S h a r e 	 o p t i o n s	
Share options are granted to directors and eligible employees under established HMRC approved and unapproved employee share option 
schemes as the Company places emphasis on the encouragement and motivation of staff. Details of the options outstanding under the 
schemes are provided in note 20 to the financial statements. Options are awarded at the higher of market value at the date of grant and 
a minimum level established by the Remuneration Committee as being acceptable to all shareholders. The Remuneration Committee 
ensures that awards are made within the overall limits authorised by shareholders and at an appropriate level for the individual, taking 
into account their role and contribution to the business, previous option grants and market practice. Share options granted to directors 
and senior managers include performance criteria as determined by the Remuneration Committee from time to time, primarily being that 
exercise is dependent on achieving a minimum share price and earnings per share growth target. 
Annual performance-related bonus scheme
In addition to basic salary, executive directors and other senior executives participate in an annual performance-related bonus scheme. 
Performance targets are designed to both stretch and encourage individuals whilst aligning their interests to that of the Group. 
In 2010, the targets for performance-related bonuses for main Board executive directors related to the Group exceeding a demanding 
target for growth in Group EBITDA, and as a result no bonuses were awarded to executive directors for 2010. The Committee may also 
award individual discretionary bonuses. In 2010, additional discretionary awards were made to Justin Wheatley and to Andrew Fabian 
following the successful disposal of the JSE contract generating revenue of US$ 4.1 million. In 2009, there were no discretionary awards. 
Bonuses do not form part of pensionable earnings. 
The Remuneration Committee wants to focus the executive team on increasing the revenue growth rate of the business and therefore 
for 2011 bonuses will also be payable based upon achieving a revenue growth target, whilst ensuring that EBITDA and operating cash 
performance are above a minimum threshold. It is anticipated that basic salary will be the substantial element of each package, unless 
revenue and profits are substantially higher than the target.
L o n g - T e r m 	 I n c e n t i v e 	 P l a n
Under the LTIP , each year after the Annual Results have been announced, the Committee will decide the number of shares over which 
options will be granted to each participant, and the performance terms for those options. The key factor governing the total number 
of options granted will be that the Company meets its earnings per share (eps) target. Assuming that this is met, and providing that 
participants have met their individual performance objectives as agreed at the start of each year, then they will be granted a number of 
options at an exercise price to be determined by the Committee.  For the 2009 award (granted in 2010), 45,000 options over shares were granted to Justin Wheatley and 35,000 options over shares were 
granted to Andrew Fabian. The strike price for these options is 135p and there are other performance conditions attached. For the 2011 
award, the Committee is recommending the grant of options to executive directors and senior executives with a notional value at grant 
dependent upon the seniority of the participant and will be related to the participant’s base salary. These options will have a strike price 
based on a premium to the market price at the time and they will be exercisable after three years. The rules governing these options will 
be identical to existing option schemes, although there will be performance criteria relating to growth in eps.
P e n s i o n s 	 a n d 	 o t h e r 	 b e n e fi t s
The Company also operates a defined contribution pension scheme for executive directors. Other benefits include allowances, life 
assurance cover of four times basic salary and membership of a private healthcare scheme. 
S e r v i c e 	 c o n t r a c t s
Each of the executive directors has a rolling contract of service, which is terminable by no more than twelve months’ notice. In the event 
of termination of a service contract, compensation amounting to the notice period would be payable. Details of service agreements for 
each executive director are as follows:

In the opinion of the directors, the FTSE™ AIM index is the most appropriate benchmark for total shareholder return comparatives. For the 
five-year period from 31 December 2005 to 31 December 2010 the total shareholder return for StatPro was +89.3%. Over the same period 
the FTSE™ AIM total shareholder return was -5.44%.  Directors’ remuneration

25 March 2011 We have audited the financial statements of StatPro Group plc for the year ended 31 December 2010 which comprise the Group Income 
statement, Group statement of Comprehensive Income, Group and Parent Company Balance Sheets, Group and Parent Company cash 
flow statements, Group statement of changes in Shareholders’ Equity, and Parent Company Statement of Changes in Equity and the 
related notes 1 to 25. The financial reporting framework that has been applied in their preparation is applicable law and International 
Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the European Union and, as regards the parent company financial statements, as 
applied in accordance with the provisions of the Companies Act 2006.
This report is made solely to the Company’s members, as a body, in accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies Act 2006 and 
our engagement letter dated 18 June 2010. Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might state to the Company’s members those 
matters we are required to state to them in an auditor’s report and for no other purpose. To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not 
accept or assume responsibility to anyone other than the Company and the Company’s members as a body, for our audit work, for this 
report, or for the opinions we have formed.
Respective responsibilities of directors and auditor
As explained more fully in the Directors’ Responsibilities Statement set out on pages 30 to 31, the directors are responsible for the 
preparation of the financial statements and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view. Our responsibility is to audit and express 
an opinion on the financial statements in accordance with applicable law and International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland). Those 
standards require us to comply with the Auditing Practices Board’s Ethical Standards for Auditors.
In addition the Company has also instructed us to:
• 	 Report our opinion on whether the section of the Directors’ Remuneration Report that is described as audited has been properly 
prepared in accordance with the basis of preparation described therein and whether the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report 
to be audited is not in agreement with the accounting records and returns;
• 	 Review the directors’ statement in relation to going concern as set out on page 38, which for a premium listed UK incorporated 
company is specified for review by the Listing Rules of the Financial Services Authority;
• 	 Review certain elements of the report to shareholders by the board on directors’ remuneration, which for a premium listed UK 
incorporated company is specified for review by the Listing Rules of the Financial Services Authority; and
• 	 Review the part of the Corporate Governance Statement relating to the Company’s compliance with the nine provisions of the June 
2008 Combined Code, which for a premium listed company is specified for review by the Listing Rules of the Financial Services Authority;
S c o p e 	 o f 	 t h e 	 a u d i t 	 o f 	 t h e 	 fi n a n c i a l 	 s t a t e m e n t s
An audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements sufficient to give reasonable assurance 
that the financial statements are free from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or error. This includes an assessment of: whether 
the accounting policies are appropriate to the Group’s and the parent Company’s circumstances and have been consistently applied and 
adequately disclosed; the reasonableness of significant accounting estimates made by the directors; and the overall presentation of the 
financial statements.
O p i n i o n 	 o n 	 fi n a n c i a l 	 s t a t e m e n t s
In our opinion:
• 	 The financial statements give a true and fair view of the state of the Group’s and of the parent Company’s affairs as at 31 December 
2010 and of the Group’s profit for the year then ended;
• 	 The Group financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the European Union;
• 	 The parent Company financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the European Union 
and as applied in accordance with the provisions of the Companies Act 2006; and
• 	 The financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006.

In our opinion the information given in the Directors’ Report for the financial year for which the financial statements are prepared is 
consistent with the financial statements.
Opinion on other matter
In our opinion the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited has been properly prepared in accordance with the basis of 
preparation as described therein. M a t t e r s 	 o n 	 w h i c h 	 w e 	 a r e 	 r e q u i r e d 	 t o 	 r e p o r t 	 b y 	 e x c e p t i o n
We have nothing to report in respect of the following matters:
Where the Companies Act 2006 requires us to report to you if, in our opinion:
• 	 Adequate accounting records have not been kept by the parent Company, or returns adequate for our audit have not been received 
from branches not visited by us; or

• 	 Certain disclosures of directors’ remuneration specified by law are not made; or
• 	 We have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit.

translation reserve incorporates the gains and losses on revaluation of the net assets and liabilities of subsidiary undertakings and other currency gains and losses 
that are treated as part of equity. Expenses associated with shares issued in the year amounted to nil (2009: £3,000). C o m p a n y

Other reserves are merger reserves amounting to £2,369,000 (2009: £2,369,000). The merger reserve arose on acquisitions and represents the difference between the fair 
value of shares issued and the nominal value of the shares. Share based payment transactions in reserves include £305,000 relating to investments in subsidiaries. 1 Principal accounting policies
The principal accounting policies adopted in the preparation of these financial statements are set out below. These policies have been 
consistently applied to all the years presented unless otherwise stated.
Accounting convention
These financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards and IFRIC interpretations 
endorsed by the European Union (EU) and with those parts of the Companies Act 2006 applicable to companies reporting under IFRS. The 
financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention as modified by available for sale investments and financial 
assets and liabilities at fair value through profit or loss. A summary of the significant Group accounting policies is set out below, together 
with an explanation of where changes have been made to previous policies on the adoption of new accounting standards in the year.
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires the use of estimates and 
assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts 
of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Although these estimates are based on management’s best knowledge of the 
amount, event or actions, actual results ultimately may differ from those estimates.
As permitted by Section 408 of the Companies Act 2006, the Company has not presented its own income statement or statement of 
comprehensive income. The profit after taxation for the financial year of the Company was £3,795,000 (2009: £5,590,000).
B a s i s 	 o f 	 p r e p a r a t i o n 	 – 	 g o i n g 	 c o n c e r n
The Group operates in the asset management sector of the financial services industry and whilst many of our clients are part of banking 
groups most of the clients are relatively resilient to the challenging economic backdrop. This is because, like StatPro itself, they themselves 
have recurring revenue business models and to a large extent, the services and software provided by StatPro are reasonably embedded 
within their core operations. We have a client base of around 260 client groups (2009: 255) which is diversified geographically and by 
product and with no significant client concentration. Our largest client group, which comprises a number of contracts for a variety of 
products and in a number of territories, represents less than 6% of recurring revenue. We plan for a level of cancellations each year but 
most of our contracts are multi-year agreements which roll into subsequent commitments unless written notice is given to terminate the 
contract. For software contracts the annual licence fee is payable in advance and for data contracts the fees are monthly in advance. For 
these reasons, we have good visibility on any potential deterioration in our trading outlook and potential risks to the business.
Renewals occur throughout the year although there is a slightly greater weighting in the fourth quarter. The Board closely monitors clients 
that are potentially at risk of cancellation as well as the pipeline of new business.
The Group has both cash and undrawn credit facilities available to support its business operations and therefore the Board believes that 
the Group is well-positioned to manage the business risks in the current uncertain environment.
After making appropriate enquiries, the directors have a reasonable expectation that the Group has adequate resources to continue in 
operational existence for the foreseeable future. For these reasons, the Board continues to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the 
Group’s financial statements.
C r i t i c a l 	 a c c o u n t i n g 	 e s t i m a t e s 	 a n d 	 j u d g m e n t s
The preparation of financial statements under IFRS requires management to make estimates and assumptions concerning the future. 
The resulting accounting estimates will, by definition, therefore not necessarily equate to the actual outcome. Estimates are made by the 
directors based on experience and estimates believed to be reasonable expectations of future outcomes. Critical accounting estimates 
and judgments are made in the following areas:
	 • 	 Impairment of non-financial assets
	 • 	 Intangible assets – carrying value
	 • 	 Deferred tax recognition
The accounting policies in respect of these items are set out below and further details can be found in notes 11 and 17.
I m p a i r m e n t 	 o f 	 n o n - fi n a n c i a l 	 a s s e t s
The Group’s impairment test for goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives is based on a value in use calculation. The 
value in use calculation is based on a discounted cash flow model. The cash flows are derived from the budget for the next five years 
and do not include restructuring activities that the Group is not yet committed to or significant future investments that will enhance the 
asset’s performance of the cash generating unit being tested. The recoverable amount is most sensitive to the discount rate used for 
the discounted cash flow model as well as the expected future cash-inflows and the growth rate used for extrapolation purposes. The  key assumptions used to determine the recoverable amount for the different cash generating units, including a sensitivity analysis, are 
disclosed further in Note 11.
I n t a n g i b l e 	 a s s e t s 	 – 	 c a r r y i n g 	 v a l u e
Development costs are capitalised in accordance with the accounting policy given below. Initial capitalisation of costs is based on 
management’s judgement that technological and economical feasibility is confirmed, usually when a product development project has 
reached a defined milestone according to an established project management model. In determining the amounts to be capitalised 
management makes assumptions regarding the expected future cash generation of the assets, discount rates to be applied and the 
expected period of the benefits.
D e f e r r e d 	 t a x 	 r e c o g n i t i o n
The Group establishes provisions, based on reasonable estimates, for possible consequences of audits by tax authorities of the respective 
countries in which it operates.  The amount of such provisions is based on various factors, such as experience with previous tax audits and 
differing interpretations of tax regulations by the taxable entity and the responsible tax authority.  Management judgment is required to 
determine the amount of deferred tax assets that can be recognised, based upon the likely timing and the level of future taxable profits 
together with an assessment of the effect of future tax planning strategies. 
N e w 	 a n d 	 a m e n d e d 	 a c c o u n t i n g 	 s t a n d a r d s 	 a n d 	 i n t e r p r e t a t i o n s
The following new and amended IFRS and IFRIC interpretations were effective as of 1 January 2010:
	 • 	 IFRS 2 “Share-based Payment: Group Cash-settled Share-based Payment Transactions” effective 1 January 2010
	 • 	 IFRS 3 “Business Combinations (Revised)” and IAS 27 “Consolidated and Separate Financial Statements (Amended)” effective 1 July 
2009, including consequential amendments to IFRS 2, IFRS 5, IFRS 7 , IAS 7, IAS 21, IAS 28, IAS 31 and IAS 39.
	 • 	 IAS 39 “Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement – Eligible Hedged Items” effective 1 July 2009
	 	 	 IFRIC 17 “Distributions of Non-cash Assets to Owners” effective 1 July 2009
	 • 	 IFRIC 18 “Transfer of Assets from Customers” effective 1 July 2009
	 • 	 Improvements to IFRSs (May 2008)
	 • 	 Improvements to IFRSs (April 2009)
The adoption of the standards or interpretations is described below:
• 	 IFRS 2 (amendments), “Group cash-settled share-based payment transactions” (effective from 1 January 2010). In addition to 
incorporating IFRIC 8, “Scope of IFRS 2”, and IFRIC 11, “IFRS 2 – Group and treasury share transactions”, the amendments expand on 
the guidance in IFRIC 11 to address the classification of Group arrangements that were not covered by the interpretation. The new 
guidance did not have a material impact on the Group’s financial statements.
• 	 IFRS 3 “Business Combinations (Revised)” and IAS 27 “Consolidated and Separate Financial Statements (Amended)”.
 IFRS 3 (Revised), “Business combinations – Comprehensive revision on applying the acquisition method” (effective from 1 July 2009), 
which will impact the way future acquisitions are reported. The Group applied IFRS 3 (Revised) from 1 January 2010 with the main 
changes being that directly attributable costs such as advisers fees and stamp duty will be charged to the income statement, 
revisions to contingent cash consideration in the period following the acquisition will be recorded in the income statement and any 
difference between the fair value of the consideration in the buy-out of non-controlling interests and the value of their reported 
non-controlling interest will be recorded against equity.
 IAS 27 (revised), “Consolidated and separate financial statements”, (effective from 1 July 2009). The revised standard requires 
the effects of all transactions with non-controlling interests to be recorded in equity if there is no change in control and these 
transactions will no longer result in goodwill or gains and losses. The standard also specifies the accounting when control is lost. Any 
remaining interest in the entity is re-measured to fair value, and a gain or loss is recognised in profit or loss. The Group has applied 
IAS 27 (revised) prospectively to transactions with non-controlling interests from 1 January 2010.
• 	 IAS 39 (amendment), “Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement – Eligible Hedged Items”, (effective from 1 July 2009). The 
amendment clarifies that an entity is permitted to designate a portion of the fair value changes or cash flow variability of a financial 
instrument as a hedged item. This also covers the designation of inflation as a hedged risk or portion in particular situations. The 
amendment had no impact on the financial position or performance of the Group, as the Group has not entered into any such hedges.
• 	 IFRIC 17, “Distributions of non-cash assets to owners” (effective from 1 July 2009) - Comprehensive guidance on when dividends 
payable should be recognised, and how an entity measures the dividend payable and how any difference between the carrying 
amount of the assets distributed and the carrying amount of the dividend payable is accounted for. The interpretation has no effect 
on either the financial position or the performance of the Group.
• 	 IFRIC 18 “Transfer of Assets from Customers” effective 1 July 2009 – The interpretation applies to entities that receive from customers 
items of property, plant and equipment or cash for the acquisition or construction of such items.  These assets are then used to 
connect customers to a network or to provide ongoing access to the supply of goods or services.  As the Group does not enter such 
transactions this interpretation is not relevant to the Group. • 	 Improvements to IFRSs, in May 2008 and April 2009, the IASB issued omnibus of amendments to its standards, primarily with a view 
to removing inconsistencies and clarifying wording. There are separate transitional provisions for each standard. The adoption of 
the following amendments resulted in changes to accounting policies but did not have any impact on the financial position or 
performance of the group.
• 	 IAS 38 (amendment), “Intangible Assets”. The amendment is part of the IASB’s annual improvements project published in April 2009 
and the Group and Company will apply IAS 38 (amendment) from the date IFRS 3 (revised) is adopted. The amendment clarifies 
guidance in measuring the fair value of an intangible asset acquired in a business combination and it permits the grouping of 
intangible assets as a single asset if each asset has similar useful economic lives. The amendment will not result in a material impact 
on the Group or Company’s financial statements.
• 	 IFRS 5 (amendment), “Measurement of non-current assets (or disposal groups) classified as held-for-sale”. The amendment is part 
of the IASB’s annual improvements project published in April 2009. The amendment provides clarification that IFRS 5 specifies the 
disclosures required in respect of non-current assets (or disposal groups) classified as held for sale or discontinued operations. It also 
clarifies that the general requirement of IAS 1 still apply, particularly paragraph 15 (to achieve a fair presentation) and paragraph 125 
(sources of estimation uncertainty) of IAS 1. The Group and Company has applied IFRS 5 (amendment) from 1 January 2010. It had no  
material impact on the Group or Company’s financial statements.
• 	 IAS 1 (amendment), “Presentation of financial statements”. The amendment is part of the IASB’s annual improvements project 
published in April 2009. The amendment provides clarification that the potential settlement of a liability by the issue of equity is 
not relevant to its classification as current or non current. By amending the definition of current liability, the amendment permits a 
liability to be classified as non-current (provided that the entity has an unconditional right to defer settlement by transfer of cash or 
other assets for at least 12 months after the accounting period) notwithstanding the fact that the entity could be required by the 
counterparty to settle in shares at any time. The Group and Company will apply IAS 1 (amendment) from 1 January 2010. It had no  
material impact on the Group or Company’s financial statements.
I n t e r p r e t a t i o n s 	 a n d 	 r e v i s e d 	 s t a n d a r d s 	 t h a t 	 a r e 	 n o t 	 y e t 	 e ff e c t i v e 	 a n d 	 h av e 	 n o t 	 b e e n 	 e a r l y 	 a d o p t e d 	 b y 	 t h e 	 G r o u p
The following interpretations to existing standards have been published that are mandatory for the Group’s future accounting but which 
the Group has not adopted early. Management has not yet fully assessed the impact of these new standards but does not believe they will 
have any material impact on the financial statements.
• 	 IFRS 7 (amendment), “Disclosures – Transfers of Financial Assets (not EU endorsed)” from 1 July 2011
• 	 IFRS 1 (amendment), “Limited Exemption from Comparative IFRS 7 Disclosures for First-time Adopters” from 1 July 2010
• 	 IFRIC 14 (amendment), “Prepayments of a Minimum Funding Requirement” from 1 January 2011
• 	 IFRIC 19, “Extinguishing Financial Liabilities with Equity Instruments”. from 1 July 2010
• 	 IFRS 9, “Financial Instruments (not EU endorsed)” from 1 January 2013
• 	 IAS 12, “Recovery of Underlying Assets”, from 1 January 2011
• 	 IAS 24 (revised), “Related Party Transactions”, from 1 January 2011
• 	 IAS 32 (amendment), “Classification of Rights Issues” from 1 February 2010
B a s i s 	 o f 	 c o n s o l i d a t i o n
The Group financial statements consolidate the financial statements of the Company and its subsidiary undertakings all made up to 
31 December each year. Subsidiaries are all entities over which the Group has the power to govern the financial and operating policies 
generally accompanying a shareholding of more than one half of the voting rights.
Revenue
Revenue represents the invoiced value of goods and services, excluding value added tax, as follows:
a) Licence revenue and related software support contracts
Licence revenue and software support contract income relating to obligations under contracts is recognised in the income statement over 
the period of the contract, on a monthly basis, from the start of the month in which the licence commences. Any balance not relating to 
the accounting period is carried forward as deferred income on the balance sheet.
b) Data fees
Data fee income is recognised in the income statement over the period of the contract, on a monthly basis, from the start of the month in 
which the contract commences. Any balance not relating to the accounting period is carried forward as deferred income on the balance 
sheet. Data overage revenue on data contracts (data revenue in excess of contracted amount) is recognised in the period that the overage 
was incurred.
c) Professional services revenue
Income relating to consultancy projects is recognised in the income statement as a right to consideration is established as a result of performance. 
 d) Royalty revenue
Income is recognised in the income statement as rights to consideration accrue. S e g m e n t a l 	 r e p o r t i n g
Operating segments are reported in a manner consistent with the internal reporting provided to the chief operating decision maker. The 
chief operating decision maker, who is responsible for allocating resources and assessing performance of the operating segments, has 
been identified as the Group Executive Board.
Research and development
Expenditure on research and development comprises salaries and related costs of personnel involved in software programming and 
development activities. Development costs are capitalised where the appropriate recognition criteria in accordance with IAS 38 are met 
including the fact that the asset and related costs can be separately identifiable, the use of the asset is technically feasible and intended, 
and that the asset is expected to generate future benefits. As a result there is an intangible asset relating to capitalised development 
costs (both internally developed and acquired) recognised on the Group’s balance sheet where the Board expects the benefits to be 
recovered through incremental revenue from future sales. Development expenditure is amortised over a three year period as this is the 
period that the directors expect the benefits to arise from the expenditure incurred. The carrying values, which are analysed by product, 
are considered carefully by the Board and are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the 
carrying amount may not be recoverable.
I n t a n g i b l e 	 a s s e t s 	 – 	 c u s t o m e r 	 c o n t r a c t s
Customer contracts acquired with acquisitions are valued based on the net contribution expected to be realised over the estimated life 
of the contracts and discounted at an appropriate discount rate, taking into account any tax effects. The intangible assets created are 
then amortised over a period of between three and seven years as this is the period that the directors expect the benefits to arise from 
the contracts. The carrying values are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying 
amount may not be recoverable.
Goodwill
For business combinations before 1 January 2010 goodwill is calculated on the difference between the fair value of the consideration 
including all costs relating to the acquisition and the fair value of the Group’s share of the identifiable net assets of the acquired entity. In 
accordance with IFRS 3 (Revised), the calculation of goodwill relating to any acquisitions that complete after 1 January 2010 will not include 
any acquisition related costs. Goodwill is not amortised but is subject to annual impairment reviews. Goodwill arising on acquisitions prior

The results and net assets of subsidiary undertakings acquired are included in the Group income statement and balance sheet using the 
acquisition method of accounting from the effective date of acquisition, the date control is gained over the subsidiary. The results, and 
net assets of subsidiary undertakings disposed of, are included in the Group income statement and balance sheet using the acquisition 
method of accounting to the effective date of disposal. Income and expenditure relating to transactions between Group undertakings are 
eliminated on consolidation.
Depreciation
The cost of fixed assets is depreciated on a straight line basis over the expected useful lives of the assets as follows:
Improvements to short leasehold property - over the period of the lease (between 3 and 12 years)
Office equipment - between 10% and 20% per annum
Fixtures and fittings - between 10% and 20% per annum
Computer equipment - 33% per annum
I n v e s t m e n t s
Investments in subsidiary undertakings are stated at cost including estimated contingent consideration less any provisions for impairment.
Cu r r e n t 	 a n d 	 d e f e r r e d 	 t a x a t i o n
The tax expense for the period comprises current and deferred tax. The current tax charge is calculated on the basis of the tax laws 
enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date in the countries where the Company’s subsidiaries operate and generate 
taxable income. Deferred taxation is recognised in respect of all temporary differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and 
their carrying amounts in the financial statements at the balance sheet date and where these transactions or events result in an obligation 
to pay more tax, or a right to pay less tax in the future. Temporary differences are differences between the Group’s taxable profits and its 
results as stated in the financial statements. Deferred taxation assets are only recognised when their recoverability is more probable than 
not. Deferred taxation is measured at the average tax rates that are expected to apply in the periods in which the temporary differences are 
expected to reverse, based on tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date. Recognised 
deferred tax is measured on a non-discounted basis. Leased assets
Rentals applicable to operating leases are charged to the income statement on a straight line basis over the term of the lease.
Financial instruments
Financial Assets
The Group classifies its financial assets in the following categories: at fair value through profit or loss, loans and receivables, and available 
for sale. The classification depends on the purpose for which the financial assets were acquired. The directors determine the classification 
of its financial assets at initial recognition.
a) Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss
Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss are financial assets held for trading. A financial asset is classified in this category if acquired 
principally for the purpose of selling in the short-term. Derivatives are also categorised as held for trading unless they are designated as 
hedges. Assets in this category are classified as current assets.
b) Loans and receivables
Loans and receivables are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an active market. 
They are included in current assets, except for those with maturities greater than 12 months after the balance sheet date, which are 
classified as non-current assets.
c) Available-for-sale financial assets
The Company does not hold any assets available for sale (other than investments in subsidiaries which are deemed to be assets available 
for sale).
B o r r o w i n g s
Borrowings are recognised initially at fair value, net of transaction costs incurred. Borrowings are subsequently stated at amortised cost; 
any difference between the proceeds (net of transaction costs) and the redemption value (including interest) is recognised in the income 
statement over the period of the borrowings using the effective interest method. Borrowings are classified as current liabilities unless the 
facility is committed such that the Group has an unconditional right to defer settlement for at least 12 months from the balance sheet date.
C a s h 	 a n d 	 c a s h 	 e q u i v a l e n t s
The Group considers all bank deposits and highly liquid investments of less than three months’ maturity (which are considered to have 
insignificant risk to a change in value) to be cash equivalents. Bank overdrafts are excluded from cash and cash equivalents and are shown 
within borrowings in current liabilities on the balance sheet.
Pensions
The Group provides contributions on behalf of certain directors and employees to a defined contribution pension scheme. Contributions 
payable in the year are charged to the income statement.
S h a r e - b a s e d 	 p ay m e n t s
In common with many high-growth technology enterprises, the Company has issued a number of share options to executives and employees. 
Under IFRS, the equity-settled share-based payment awards are valued at fair value at inception and this cost is recognised over the option 
vesting period (typically three years). As there is no readily available market price for the options the Board has used an independent model 
to estimate the fair value of the options. There are a number of assumptions which affect the value and the Board has considered carefully 
these assumptions in order to derive an appropriate charge for the cost of options (note 20). The financial effect of awards by the Company 
of options over its equity shares to employees of subsidiary undertakings are recognised by the Company in its individual statements as an 
increase in its investments in subsidiaries with a credit to equity equivalent to the IFRS 2 cost in subsidiary undertakings.
Dividend distribution
Dividend distribution to the Company’s shareholders is recognised as a liability in the Group’s financial statements in the period in which 
the dividend becomes a liability of the Company. In the case of an interim dividend this is on the payment date; for final dividends this 
arises on the passing of the relevant resolution at the Annual General Meeting of the shareholders.
E x c e p t i o n a l 	 i t e m s
Material and non-recurring amounts are disclosed as exceptional items when in the opinion of the directors the size or nature of the 
amounts is such that separate disclosure is considered necessary. Foreign currencies
Transactions in foreign currencies are recorded at the rate ruling at the date of the transaction. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated 
in foreign currencies are retranslated at the rate of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date. All differences are taken to the income 
statement. The assets and liabilities of overseas subsidiary undertakings are translated at the rate of exchange ruling at the balance sheet 
date. The profit and loss for the year is translated at the average rate for the year. The exchange differences arising on retranslation of 
opening net assets are taken to other comprehensive income. The difference between the profit and loss at the average rate and closing 
rate are taken to other comprehensive income. All other translation differences are taken to the income statement.

The Group’s operating segments have been determined based on the information regularly reviewed by the Group Executive Board, 
which has been identified as the Chief Operating Decision Maker (“CODM”). During the year there has been a change in the way the 
business is managed and in the information presented to and reviewed by the CODM. The reportable segments in the prior year of United 
Kingdom, Rest of Europe and Rest of the World are considered as EMEAA after presenting Central costs separately. The North American 
regional segment is unchanged. The reportable segments in the current year reflect the revised structure and the prior year has been re-
presented accordingly. The Group Executive Board considers the business to be split into two primary geographical markets: EMEAA and 
North America, which are each managed by a regional CEO. Central costs relate to the expenses related to the Group’s headquarters and 
costs directly associated with the parent Company, which are managed by the Group management team. Exceptional items relating to the 
software disposal in 2010 and the refinancing in 2009 are included under Central. The external debt is held within Central.
All revenue, profit/(loss) before taxation and total assets are attributable to the principal activity of the Group, being the development, 
marketing and distribution of software, data solutions and related professional services to the global asset management industry. 
Segment assets represent those assets arising from the operating activities of those segments. Segment results exclude the impact of any 
intercompany recharges of revenues or costs. Revenue was generated in the UK of £8.1 million (2009: £8.6 million) with non-current assets 
held by UK entities totalling £22.1 million (2009: £19.6 million).

The Company made an exceptional gain on disposal of software of £0.50 million, being the difference between the cash received for 
the software element (£1.10 million) and the carrying value and associated costs of the software (£0.60 million), following the disposal of 
non-core software and related services under the JSE contract in the first half of 2010 for a total cash amount of £2.50 million.
The operating exceptional item of £0.96 million relates to severance payments, and onerous leases, following a restructuring in the second 
half of 2010 to re-focus the business on SaaS. There were no operating exceptional items in 2009.
The non-operating exceptional gain on refinancing in February 2009 amounting to £1.16 million resulted from the redemption of the old 
financing facility at an amount below the carrying value of the debt.

StatPro exercised its option to acquire the 49% non-controlling interest in SiSoft in June 2010 for an estimated contingent consideration of approximately £1.3 
million and our estimate has not changed, but as the vendors are disputing certain aspects of the valuation, the process has not been completed in 2010 as 
expected. In January 2011, a legal process in the French Commercial Court was commenced to try to resolve the matter and formally complete the acquisition. It is 
probable that the matter will not be fully resolved during 2011 and we will provide a further update if the position changes materially or on the completion of the 
acquisition.

The directors are recommending a final dividend of 1.7p per ordinary share (2009: 0.2p) making a total dividend for the year of 2.4p per ordinary share (2009: 2.1p). 
If the dividend is approved at the Annual General Meeting in May 2011 then the dividend will be paid on 25 May 2011 to shareholders on the register at the close of 
business on 26 April 2011 (ex-div date 20 April 2011). The Company paid a second interim dividend for 2009 of 1.3p per ordinary share payable on 24 March 2010. In 
accordance with IFRS the dividend is not provided in the accounts until it becomes a legal liability of the Company and will therefore be recorded in the interim and 
annual accounts for 2011. 1 0 	 E a r n i n g s 	 p e r 	 s h a r e
Basic earnings per share is calculated by dividing the profit attributable to ordinary shareholders by the weighted average number of 
ordinary shares in issue during the year. Diluted earnings per share is calculated by adjusting the weighted number of ordinary shares 
outstanding to assume conversion of all dilutive potential shares into ordinary shares. The Company has two categories of dilutive 
potential ordinary shares: shares to be issued and share options. For the share options, a calculation is done to determine the number of 
shares that could have been acquired at fair value (determined as the average annual market share price of the Company’s shares) based 
on the monetary value of the subscription rights attached to the outstanding share options. The number of shares calculated as above is 
compared with the number of shares that would have been issued assuming the exercise of the share options.
The exchangeable non-voting shares in StatPro Canada Inc (formerly FRI Corporation) which are held by former holders of ordinary shares 
in FRI Corporation and can be exchanged for StatPro Group plc ordinary shares at any time prior to 24 October 2011, are excluded from the 
basic earnings per share calculation but they are included in the potentially dilutive shares in the diluted earnings per share calculation.

The carrying value of goodwill arising on acquisition is reviewed at each balance sheet date to assess whether there has been any 
impairment. Goodwill arising on acquisitions is allocated to cash generating units (CGUs) by considering the Group’s share of the cash that 
is expected to be generated by the business or product that was acquired. The evaluation is based on management forecasts over the 
period five years forward and assuming a terminal value based on zero growth thereafter. The expected future cash flows are discounted 
at a discount rate of 10% (2009: 10%), based upon an estimated risk-adjusted pre-tax weighted average cost of capital. To assess for 
impairment the value in use of the CGU is compared to the goodwill. If the resultant net present value of the discounted cash flows is less 
than the carrying value for goodwill the difference is written off through the income statement. Key assumptions in the projection of cash 
flows are: levels of new sales, renewal rates, growth in expenses and the discount rate. Management base these projections using the latest 
budgets and forecasts which take into account market conditions and economic factors. The headroom is therefore dependent upon 
sensitivities to these and other assumptions. The largest element of goodwill is in the North American region and if there were no growth 
in EBITDA in the region then this could result in impairment, however, it is not considered that there would be any impairment based on 
any reasonable set of assumptions. The goodwill on all acquisitions has been reviewed and, in the opinion of the directors, there are no 
impairments to the carrying values at 31 December 2010 (2009: nil). Acquired and internally generated development costs
Expenditure on research and development comprises salaries and related costs of personnel involved in software programming and 
development activities. Development costs are capitalised, where recognition criteria are met. As a result there is an intangible asset 
relating to capitalised development costs (both internally developed and acquired) recognised on the Group’s balance sheet where the 
Board expects the benefits to be recovered through incremental revenue from future sales. Development expenditure is amortised over a 
three year period as, in the opinion of the directors, this is the period over which the benefits arise. The carrying values, which are analysed 
by product, are considered carefully by the Board and if there has been any impairment in any development costs then the carrying value 
is written down accordingly. There were no impairments in 2010 (2009: nil).
Cu s t o m e r 	 c o n t r a c t s
Customer contracts acquired were valued on acquisition by estimating the future cash flows deriving from those contracts over a period 
varying between three and seven years depending on the type of contract and discounting the flows at a discount rate of 10% (2009: 
10%), adjusting for any tax impact. The resultant fair value for the acquired customer contracts is amortised over a period of between 
three and seven years as, in the opinion of the directors, this is the period over which the benefits arise. At each balance sheet date the 
current values of the original contracts is reviewed against the carrying values to assets for impairment. The acquired customer contracts 
have been reviewed and, in the opinion of the directors, there are no impairments to the carrying values at 31 December 2010 (2009: nil).

The Company’s and Group’s key financial risks and its approach to managing these risks are described in the Financial Review on pages 
16 to 17.
a) Financial instruments
The Group’s financial instruments comprise cash, money market deposits, bank loans, provisions, derivative financial instruments and 
various other items, such as accounts receivable and accounts payable, that arise directly from its operations.
Cash and money market deposits, when held, are carried at fair value. All financial assets except derivatives belong to the category ‘loans 
and receivables in IAS 39. All financial liabilities except derivatives are held at amortised cost. The only financial derivatives relate to forward 
currency contracts and interest rate caps which are purchased from banks and these are considered Level 2 financial instruments in 
accordance with IFRS 7.
Bank loans are recorded at the value of the proceeds received less any direct issue costs which, due to the short term nature of these 
instruments, approximates to fair value. They are subsequently stated at cost plus accrued interest, less any repayments which, due to the 
short term nature of these instruments, approximates to amortised cost using the effective interest rate method.
Further information on contingent consideration can be found in note 16.
Derivative financial assets are used by the Group to hedge against various financial risks, such as foreign currency and interest rate risk. 
They are initially recognised at fair value and are designated by the entity at fair value through profit or loss.
As at 31 December 2010, the Group held forward currency hedging contracts to mitigate the effects of currency exposure relating to non- sterling 
financial assets and liabilities, cash flows and investments. The fair value of forward currency contracts relating to commercial transactions is 
recognised through the income statement, the net unrealised gain in respect of these contracts as at 31 December 2010 was £44,000. The fair 
value of forward currency contracts relating to hedging of net investments designated in hedge accounting relationships is recognised through 
equity, the net unrealised loss relating to these contracts recognised through equity as at 31 December 2010 was £1 15,000.
The Company recognises financial instruments in its accounts when it enters into a binding agreement to receive cash or other economic 
benefits and derecognises them once all parties to the agreement have discharged all of their obligations.
Financial assets comprise cash, rental deposits and trade debtors. Rental deposits have maturity profiles of less than one year and between 
one and five years and are settled net in cash. Bank loans and provisions have maturity profiles of less than one year and between one 
and five years.
Interest income and expenses are recognised in the income statement on an accruals basis. Realised gains and losses upon expiry of 
derivative financial instruments are recognised on settlement of the underlying contract.

The Company retains its senior debt facility with RBS, which is committed to February 2014, subject to compliance with agreed covenants. 
In 2010, the Company agreed some amendments to the facility as follows:
• 	 The £7 million bullet repayment can be repaid in whole or in part using the revolving credit facility (“RCF”); this allows greater 
flexibility in financing arrangements as previously the RCF needed to be fully repaid before repaying the bullet.
• 	 The Company voluntarily cancelled part of the RCF to reduce the facility to £6.15 million given our lower financing requirement, 
whilst maintain considerable financial headroom.
As a result the current facilities available as at 31 December 2010 comprise:
• Term loan of £7.0 million with bullet repayment in February 2014 (early repayment allowed).
• Multi-currency fully revolving five-year amortising loan amounting to an initial value of £10.25 million with six-monthly repayments 
(approximately £6.15 million available (2009: £9.15 million)).
• Flexibility to repay early with no penalty and to redraw within the amortising limits.
•  Multi-currency revolving working capital loan amounting to £2.0 million (approximately £1.11 million available (2009: £1.88 million)).
There are covenants associated with the facility primarily relating to the gearing (gross debt/EBITDA), interest cover and debt service ratio. 
Repayments of the loans are on a six-monthly basis and subject to compliance with the covenants, the facility remains committed until 
February 2014.
As part of the secured financing arrangement with the Royal Bank of Scotland plc, the bank has security over certain of the Group’s assets, 
including pledges over shares in certain subsidiaries.

As part of our liability management, we have made use of currency swaps to create synthetic currency hedges denominated in a mixture 
of currencies (USD, CAD, and EUR) in order to provide a partial currency hedge against movements in the fair value of investments in 
overseas subsidiaries. As at 31 December 2010, the Group had currency swaps in place with a notional principal amount of £5.47 million as 
synthetic loan hedges. The Group recognised a net loss on the hedging instrument of £0.11 million in equity. In 2009, the Group’s Canadian 
dollar, US dollar and Euro denominated debt was designated as a hedge of the net investment in the Group’s overseas operations, the fair 
value of these borrowings at 31 December 2009 was £4.93 million and the foreign exchange gain was £0.09 million on the translation of 
these borrowings recognised in equity. b) Financial risk management

Floating rate financial liabilities predominantly relate to bank loans in sterling, Canadian dollars, US dollars and Euros. Some debt is 
denominated in currencies in order to provide a currency hedge for profits generated by overseas’ subsidiaries and the investments in 
those overseas’ net assets.
In February 2009, the Company purchased a 3 year interest rate cap on a notional £10 million of debt at a strike price of 3% (based 
on 3 month GBP LIBOR). The Board believes this was a cost effective way of benefiting from falling interest rates whilst protecting the 
Company from potential adverse interest rate movements over the three years to February 2012. The cost of the cap has been amortised 
over the life of the instrument and is not marked to market. The market value of the cap at 31 December 2010 is considered immaterial.
The following table shows the sensitivity to reasonably possible changes in interest rates (with all other variables held constant) of the 
Group’s profit before tax through the impact of floating rate borrowings. (The risk is limited because of the interest rate cap purchased as 
described above).

• 	 Cu r r e n c y 	 r i s k
The Group’s principal exposure to exchange rate fluctuations arises on the translation of overseas net assets and trading results into sterling 
for accounting purposes. The Group has a minimal transaction risk as most of the transactions are invoiced by the entities in their local 
currency. Where there are material exposures, these are covered by taking out currency contracts to eliminate the exposure. The Group 
does not make use of foreign currency hedges to manage currency profit and loss translation risk. However, offsetting revenues against 
costs in the same currency reduces this risk so that only the residual accounting profit translation element is at risk. The balance sheet 
exposures are minimised by reducing the net asset exposure, for example, by arranging borrowings in local currency where appropriate. 
Where the resulting hedge qualifies for hedge accounting under IAS 39 the gains and losses on the translation of both the loan and the 
investment are deferred in equity. As the Group continues to grow and generates greater net profits overseas this exchange rate exposure 
will increase. Following the increase in the percentage of the Group’s operations that are overseas, the exposure to US dollars and Euros 
in particular has increased. The table below shows the estimated sensitivity of the profit before tax and the net assets to movements in the key exchange rates to 
which the Group is exposed. If the US dollar and the euro strengthen/(weaken) against sterling this is expected to increase/(decrease) 
profits as shown below.

The main balance sheet translation exposure is to the revaluation of goodwill denominated in foreign currency; the largest component 
relates to the goodwill arising on the acquisition of FRI, a Canadian business and is denominated in Canadian dollars. A depreciation of 
10% in sterling against Canadian dollar would result in a £3.7 million increase in net assets and an appreciation of 10% in sterling against 
Canadian dollar would result in a £3.7 million decrease in net assets.
The fair value of all financial assets and liabilities is approximately equal to book value. The Group has a forward foreign exchange facility which 
allows the Group to hedge foreign exchange exposures. The Group does not permit anyone in the Group to trade in financial instruments.
• 	 C o u n t e r p a r t y 	 c r e d i t 	 r i s k
This is the risk that a counterparty will be unable to pay amounts in full when due. Credit risks are associated with deposits with banks and 
receivables from customers. The Group takes into account the credit risk of the counterparty to any major bank deposits but currently the 
level of bank deposits is such that this is not considered a material risk. There is no large concentration of credit risk with customers as the 
largest customer group currently represents less than 6% of projected Group revenues. The maximum exposure to credit risk comprises 
the value of the Group’s cash and debtor balances from time to time.
• 	 L i q u i d i t y 	 r i s k
This is the risk that the Group will have insufficient funds to meet its cash obligations when due. The Group manages this risk by close 
monitoring of projected cash collection from customers and cash obligations to suppliers and salary payments to staff, as well as all other 
cash commitments. The Group also has approximately £7.26 million headroom under its committed revolving credit and overdraft facility 
in addition to cash reserves to reduce the risk that an unforeseen change in the Group’s liquidity position will result in a breach of statutory 
or other payment obligations. The table below summarises the maturity of the Group’s financial liabilities as at 31 December 2010 and 2009 based on contractual 
undiscounted payments. In the table below interest rates on variable loans are based on the rates at 31 December 2010.

The Board’s policy is to maintain a strong capital base so as to maintain investor, creditor and market confidence and to sustain further 
development of the business. The Board monitors the composition of investors as well as the return on capital, measured as earnings per share 
(profit attributable to shareholders divided by the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue during the year). The capital managed 
by the Group comprises equity of £43.72 million (2009: £37.59 million) and borrowings of £7.28 million (2009: £11.26 million) as capital. 19 Obligations under operating leases

The Company has only one class of ordinary shares in issue and there are no restrictions regarding voting or other distribution or repayment 
rights. As at 31 December 2010 the Company held 225,000 shares in treasury (2009: nil), and therefore 60,727,232 ordinary shares is the 
number of shares that may be used by shareholders in the Company as the denominator for the calculations by which they will determine 
if they are required to notify their interest in, or a change in their interest in, the share capital of the Company under the FSA’s Disclosure 
and Transparency Rules, and for earnings per share calculations. The Company purchased into treasury 475,000 shares at an average 
price of 107.7p and sold 250,000 at 128p leaving a balance of 225,000 shares in treasury at 31 December 2010. As a result of these share 
transactions, the share premium account has increased to £17.18 million (2009: £16.91 million).

Under the approved and unapproved option schemes the Remuneration Committee can grant options to employees of the Group. 
Options are granted with a fixed exercise price which is typically issued at a premium to the market price. The contractual life is generally 
ten years from date of grant although occasionally a shorter period has been chosen. Options become exercisable after three years 
although exceptionally the period is shorter. Options issued to directors and senior executives carry performance criteria. There are other 
vesting conditions for options identified in the scheme rules, including performance conditions which are included in the option terms 
including typically eps growth above a minimum hurdle, share price growth above a minimum level and a vesting period of three years. 
Options are generally settled by equity settlement but at the discretion of the Board, options can be net settled for cash. Options are 
valued using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model and the fair market value has been estimated using the following key assumptions:

Fair value of options issued in year 27.3p 17.5p 2.9p 1.6p
The risk free rate is based on the yield to maturity of a UK government bond for a term consistent with the assumed life of the options. 
The average share price in the year was 114p. The average market share price for options exercised during the year was 125p. The expected 
volatility level was determined by comparing the historic and current volatility for the Company and comparing with the average volatility 
for companies in the same sector to determine a reasonable estimate for the future volatility. The total charge in the year relating to 
employee share based payments for the Group was £78,000 (2009: £107,000). The total charge in the year relating to employee share based 
payments for the Company was £7,000 (2009: £60,000).
There were 2,237,700 options exercisable at the balance sheet date (2009: 2,560,612) with a weighted average exercise price of 87p (2009: 
77p). The weighted average remaining contractual life for options outstanding at the balance sheet date is 4.5 years (2009: 4.7 years).
21 Related party transactions
During the year the Group used the services of Buzzacott, Chartered Accountants, of which GFMT Wheatley (Company Secretary) is a

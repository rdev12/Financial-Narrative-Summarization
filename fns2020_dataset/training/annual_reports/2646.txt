04
We believe the business has performed creditably 
in what has been and remains a challenging market 
environment. We have continued the process, begun in 
2007, of narrowing the focus of the business and have, 
by taking steps to slim down our cost base, moved into 
profit for the year. This, allied to strong working capital 
management, has left our cash position unchanged on 
2007 and has ensured we enter 2009 with a healthy cash 
balance. 
Our Consulting business revenues held up well in a 
difficult market. This bears testimony to the strength of 
our client relationships and our clients’ perception of the 
quality of the service we deliver. The business won several 
important new accounts and with increased revenue 
across more engagements the business starts 2009 from a 
position of strength.
In our Software business we have continued investing in 
our strategic products. Our balance sheet substantiation 
product, Integrity, went live at Deutsche Bank, our first 
client, and we also saw the first sale of our new version 
of Arc to HSBC. We have made progress in improving the 
quality of our revenues and the move to an annuity based 
model has reduced our reliance on non-recurring revenue. 
2009 is set to be another important year for our Software 
business with a market where the need for increased 
governance, risk management and control is becoming 
widely accepted set against a general tightening of 
clients’ budgets. 
The well publicised difficulties experienced in the financial 
services sector and the wider economy as a whole, 
which are expected to continue throughout 2009, will 
make for another challenging year. Our cash position 
together with our strong management team provides me 
with confidence that we are well placed to meet these 
challenges. 
I’d like to finish by thanking all of our staff for their 
enthusiasm, commitment and hard work during 2008.

 Chairman’s Statement/Case Study
“We wanted to take a consolidated view to quickly 
identify potential problems across functions, asset 
classes and regions. The quicker you know about a 
problem, the quicker you can do something about 
it. It’s my early warning system.”
 Case Study: Deutsche Bank Implements BCS Integrity™
Summary
Deutsche Bank implemented BCS Integrity™ to take control of 
the global balance sheet reconciliation and sign-off process. This 
product was rolled out globally in 6 months to 3,000 users in 48 
locations, covering 1.5 million accounts, sourced from 10 ledger 
systems, via 60 feeds.
Key Objectives
• A single global hierarchy capable of supporting all the 
complexity of a large distributed organisation
•  Improve transparency across the entire organisation’s P&L 
exposure
•  Facilitate more efficient use of resources
•  Manage down operational risk
•  Enforce account ownership
•  Full audit trail
Solution
BCS Integrity™ is installed in a single US data centre and accessed 
via web browser by over 3,000 users in 48 countries across the 
globe. Each user has access to only those accounts assigned to 
them by the configurable ownership rules matrix. The screens are 
configured to show data in local terminology and layout whilst 
providing global transparency across the business enterprise through 
intra-day reporting. Orphaned accounts are quickly identified and 
re-assigned through the ownership management function.
The application imports data from over 60 individual feeds sourced 
from 10 general ledgers ranging on complexity from spreadsheets 
to SAP . The monthly timetable determines when it is valid to accept 
data imports, and controls the sign-off deadlines for each step in 
the process. Users are notified when the imported balance on an 
account differs from the signed-off balance. Account data and 
exceptions are recorded in a single, centralised repository, giving 
managers instant visibility of the consolidated balance sheet and 
P&L impact.
BCS Integrity™ allows Deutsche Bank to use their offshore service 
centre to perform the initial reconciliations and the workflow 
functionality manages the handover of the accounts back to the 
onshore owners for verification and sign-off.
Hotspots are used as an early warning system to clearly identify 
those balances most at risk. Operations and Finance users can 
clearly see which accounts need additional investigation.
Benefits
•  Finance and Operations work from a single source of truth for 
accounts, owners, balances, P&L impact, workflow and reporting
•  Early warning of potential risk areas and ability to drill into the 
detail
•  Orphaned accounts easy to find and assign
•  Reduced cost and improved control
•  Increased process efficiency and visibility
•  Consolidated management information reports with historic 
trend analysis
•  Instant access to balances and P&L exposure across the entire 
organisation
•  Ownership, accountability and transparency across the entire set 
of accounts
•  A single application meeting both global and local business 
requirements
•  Integral support for offshore service teams

 Chief Executive’s Review
2008 has been a year of continued progress in tightening the focus 
in both of our businesses. In the Consulting business we have sought 
to improve the quality of our service delivery by narrowing our service 
offering to areas where we believe our knowledge provides us with 
a genuine competitive advantage. In the Software business we have 
continued the process of concentrating on our strategic products. We 
have sought to reduce our reliance on one-off bespoke projects and 
have continued investing significantly in getting our strategic products 
ready for market.
Financial Performance
Revenue
Group revenues for the year at £9.0m were down 7% on 2007. The 
Consulting business, in a difficult marketplace, achieved a 2% increase 
for the year on 2007. The Software business saw its revenues fall back 
by 38% on 2007 to £1.26m as a result of the Group’s decision not to 
actively pursue one-off bespoke solutions business. It is worth noting 
that the Software division’s 2007 revenues were significantly boosted by 
a large one-off bespoke project. Removing the impact of this project, we 
are encouraged to see that the underlying software business would have 
grown by 19% in 2008.
Contracted annuity revenues recognised during the year represented 
64% of Software revenue up from 25% in 2007, an increase of 
£290,000. Deferred income as at 31 December 2008 was £158,000 
down from £298,000 as at 31 December 2007.
Margin
Gross margin for the Group fell back 2% to 36% for the year principally 
due to the stronger sales performance from the traditionally lower 
margin Consulting division. The underlying margin in the Consulting 
business improved by 2 percentage points on 2007, as a result of the 
business focusing its service offer on higher margin engagements and 
high staff utilisation with rates approaching 90% for the year. The 
margin for the Software business reduced to 63% from 66%.
Operating expenses
Group operating expenses for the year continue to be largely personnel-
related, and have fallen by 20% on 2007. During the year £514,000 
of development costs were capitalised (2007: £552,000). The sale and 
implementation of our Integrity product saw us begin amortising our 
investment in Integrity and saw a charge in the year of £147,000 (2007: 
£nil). Removing the impact of development cost capitalisation and 
amortisation, operating expenses have fallen by £1,016,000. Reduced 
Directors’ emoluments and a lower charge for share-based payments 
account for £357,000 of this fall. The remainder of the reduction stems 
from our strategy of concentrating the Software business on building 
and selling our core strategic products allowing us to cut back on our 
solution delivery capability with average heads employed in the Software 
business in 2008 falling from 35 to 26.
Profit before tax
As a result of the tight cost controls outlined above, the Group recorded 
a profit before tax for the year of £36,000 compared to a loss before tax 
of £399,000 for 2007.
Intangible assets
The Group concentrated its development efforts in the first half of 
the year on completing and delivering its balance sheet substantiation 
product Integrity. The development focus in the second half of the year 
was on our remaining two strategic products: Agent Reconciliation 
and Control (Arc); and Operational Control Architecture (OCA). At the 
balance sheet date the carrying value of our investment in our strategic 
software products stood at £954,000 (2007: £587,000). 
Trade debtors
Trade debtor days outstanding have improved significantly, falling to 38 
from 61 in 2007.
Cash
The Group increased its cash by £16,000 leaving it unchanged at £2.8m. 
2007 saw an outflow of £906,000. There are two principal factors 
behind this improvement: operating cash before movements in working 
capital swung from an outflow of £206,000 to an inflow of £225,000 
and the improvement in debtor days produced an inflow of £741,000. 
We invested £514,000 (2007: £552,000) in building our strategic 
software products during the year. 
Dividend
The Directors do not recommend the payment of a final dividend for the 
year ended 31 December 2008 (2007: nil).
Consulting Division
The division had a successful year, achieving a growth of 2% in a difficult 
market. The year saw us manage a significant amount of client churn as 
a number of long-standing engagements came to an end. As a result, 
more than half of our revenue in 2008 came from new engagements, up 
from 35% for 2007. 
We have continued to focus our offering on the financial services sector. 
Our aim is to become the leading specialist provider of management 
consultancy services to the Capital Markets, Investment Management 
and Asset Servicing sectors. During the year we have defined and 
targeted our service offerings on the areas of Operational Risk & 
Control; Business Transformation; Client Servicing; and Strategic Cost 
Management. We have invested in recruiting and developing staff to 
ensure we have specific industry expertise and skills to deliver a quality 
service to our clients. The division’s business development capability 
was significantly enhanced during the year through investing in training 
existing personnel, recruiting those skills and developing our sales 
collateral to fit with our newly defined service offerings. 
Average headcount employed in the Consulting business remained 
unchanged on 2007 as we responded to market conditions by reining 
16271BUSINESS.indd   06 16271BUSINESS.indd   06 27/04/2009   14:26 27/04/2009   14:26 16271    27/04/2009      Proof 5

Chief Executive’s Review
in our recruitment plans. However, the current market environment 
is creating churn at some of our competitors and we will continue 
selectively to recruit new consultants on an opportunistic basis where we 
feel we can add important new skills to our offering. We have worked 
hard at being more efficient in 2008 through defining our service 
offering and managing our resource pool. Utilisation rates have improved 
to close to 90% and the attrition rate has fallen. Both of these factors 
have contributed to an improvement of 2% in gross margin. 
Software Division
We are now firmly focused on our three strategic products: 
1. Integrity — provides senior management of our client organisations 
with transparency and enables greater control over the balance sheet 
substantiation process. It provides management with confidence that 
the assets and liabilities held on the Company’s balance sheet are 
accurately stated. 
2. Operational Control Architecture (OCA) — gives senior management 
visibility over their business processes, identifying and prioritising 
any risk areas. The product is currently operational in five leading 
banking Groups.
 3. Agent Reconciliation & Control (Arc) — the next generation of our 
existing product (Network Management) validates agent banks’ 
invoices against system generated expected fees and highlights any 
discrepancies for investigation.
This increased focus has enabled us to reduce the headcount engaged in 
our Software business from an average of 35 to 26 and has contributed 
to the removal of £700,000 of cost from the division. Our Software 
revenues have fallen back as a direct consequence of our decision 
not to actively pursue our bespoke solutions business and were down 
38% on 2007. We have, however, made progress in transitioning the 
business into an annuity revenue model with more than half of 2009’s 
target contracted as at 31 December 2008. Recurring revenues at 64% 
of Software revenue for the year, up from 25% in 2007, grew 57% on 
2007. Our strategy remains to build the quality of our future revenue 
stream through selling our new products on an annuity basis.
We have continued to invest in our strategic products with £514,000 
of internal labour development costs being capitalised during the year. 
Integrity was completed and installed in the year at our reference 
client, Deutsche Bank, and has now been deployed globally. Our 
development resource is now working on our next version of Arc
and on updating OCA.
Our sales and marketing efforts in 2008 were hampered by the delayed 
launch of Integrity and the deepening financial crisis in the final quarter. 
However, we have significantly expanded our sales reach during the year 
with two distribution agreements being signed. In April we entered into 
a partnership agreement with US-based Enterprise Solution Providers 
Inc (ESP) to market and sell Integrity to financial services firms in the US. 
Progress has been slow here and the turmoil in the financial markets has 
prevented us from making any real headway. In December we entered 
into a distribution agreement with Nimbus Partners Limited for OCA. 
Nimbus markets a complementary product which, when combined with 
OCA, should create a compelling proposition. Nimbus, through its sales 
force, gives us significantly more sales reach which also extends to 
other industry sectors. We are greatly encouraged by the progress 
made to date.
The financial crisis has brought the need for increased operational 
risk management into even greater focus. The need for effective risk 
management solutions underpinned by monitoring and control processes 
is now widely accepted with operational control now no longer simply 
limited to ensuring banks’ capital ratios are in line with Basel II. There is 
now recognition of the need for increased visibility and timely reporting 
to facilitate enhanced performance monitoring. Both OCA and Integrity 
address these needs and we are seeing increasing levels of interest in our 
products. 
Employees
Group average headcount employed during the year fell by 12 to 98, 
of which 81 were permanent employees, down from 93 in 2007. The 
decrease in headcount can be attributed to the rationalisation of the 
Software business and increased efficiencies within central corporate 
costs. 
Strategy
Despite the current turbulence in our end markets, we remain 
committed to the course that we have set the business on and believe 
that this is the right strategy to deliver long-term shareholder value. We 
continue to concentrate on delivering a focused, high quality proposition 
to our customer base and on tightly managing our cost base in order 
that we can present a strong and predictable business proposition to our 
shareholders and customers.
The Consulting division is increasingly robust with revenues in 2008 now 
more evenly distributed across a number of engagements. The Software 
division’s goal remains building and establishing Integrity, OCA and Arc 
as industry leading products. 2009 has already seen an increased level of 
activity on the sales and marketing front as we seek to capitalise on the 
renewed interest in the areas of operational risk and control. 
Current Trading and Outlook 
The performance of the Consulting division in the year to date is in 
line with its performance for the same period in 2008. However, due 
to the nature of our assignments, visibility in this division is limited 
and historically, to no more than three months. We are therefore 
concentrating our efforts on building our sales pipeline in what 
continues to be an extremely challenging market.
In the Software division we start the year with more than half of our 
budgeted revenue for the year already contracted. Whilst the increased 
interest in the area of operational control and risk is encouraging, we 
remain targeted on a shrinking financial services sector where many of 
our potential customers are operating under strict budgetary constraints. 
We expect market conditions to remain challenging throughout 2009. 
However, our healthy cash position, our agility, the strength of our client 
relationships and our lean cost base give us confidence that we are well 
positioned to emerge from 2009 in a healthy state.

Directors’ Report
The Directors present their report and the audited financial statements 
for Business Control Solutions Group plc for the year ended 31 
December 2008.
Principal activities
Business Control Solutions Group plc provides management consultancy 
services and operational control software to financial institutions. The 
Company is the holding Company for the Business Control Solutions 
Group. Details of the Group’s subsidiaries are set out on page 42.
Business review and future developments
The Chairman’s Statement and Chief Executive’s Review on pages 4 to 7 
contain a review of the Group’s performance during the year, including 
the Group’s key performance metrics, of revenue, margin and staff 
utilisation, as well as its likely future development.
Risk management
The Group’s risk management process seeks to allow the early 
identification, evaluation and management of any significant operational 
risks facing the business to ensure adequate internal controls are in place 
to mitigate these risks. The key risks are reviewed annually by senior 
management and a report is prepared for the Audit and Risk Committee.
The key business risks affecting the Company are set out below:
Competition
The Group operates in a highly competitive and dynamic market. This 
could result in not only downward pressure on our margins but also that 
we may not meet all our customers’ expectations. In order to mitigate 
this risk, our managers work closely with our clients to fully understand 
their requirements and define any deliverables. During the life of any 
engagement we ensure the client is engaged through regular update 
and progress meetings.
Products and services
Although the Group’s software products are not involved in our clients’ 
transactional business, they do nonetheless provide an active tool in 
ensuring their operations are managed effectively and remain under 
control. The Group looks to manage the reputational risk of our products 
failing to provide ongoing functionality as installed by investing in the 
recruitment and retention of highly experienced programmers and 
effective Quality Assurance and Delivery teams. 
Some of the Group’s products provide clients with a tool to help them 
comply with UK and other national government legislation such as 
Sarbanes Oxley, Basel II and MiFID. There is the risk that such products 
could fail to ensure compliance in an ever changing and demanding 
regulatory environment which in turn would put the products’ longer 
term viability at risk and cause associated risk to our reputation. The 
Group looks to mitigate this risk by employing managers who are well 
versed in the regulatory requirements. In turn, they are supported on the 
consultancy side by relevant subject matter experts.
Similarly, the Group offers a range of consultancy services to clients to 
assist them in managing projects, introducing cost control programmes, 
technological change and high level business consultancy. There is a risk 
that the Group could fail to provide the appropriate resources to meet 
its clients’ requirements and ultimately fail to meet the pre-determined 
project deliverables. The Group looks to mitigate this risk by not only 
employing staff who are suitably qualified and experienced but also by 
ensuring the contract deliverables are clearly defined, achievable and 
agreed between the contracting parties.
Employees
The Group’s staff is vital to the success of our business. If the Group 
were to lose key managerial, technical or sales staff then this could have 
a serious impact on the business. The Group’s future success depends 
largely upon its ability to retain and recruit appropriately qualified staff 
to ensure it can meet the requirements of its clients and also to ensure 
its products remain at the forefront technologically and functionally. To 
mitigate these issues, the Group looks to ensure it provides its employees 
with a competitive remuneration package and constantly monitors 
the market for potential new recruits. The Group looks to retain the 
services of its employees through ensuring they remain motivated 
by the demands of the Group’s businesses and the work they carry 
out as employees. All our employees are regularly appraised and are 
encouraged to develop their skills and where appropriate are promoted 
in line with their potential.
Intellectual property
The Group’s software business could suffer should third parties infringe 
the Group’s intellectual property rights. The Group has taken reasonable 
steps to ensure its intellectual property rights are protected by law.
The Group’s management team is experienced in managing the risks 
identified above. The Group has a strong balance sheet with significant 
cash and trade debtor balances derived from the Group transacting 
business with well-rated customers and as such does not consider the 
Group is subject to undue financial risk.
Going concern
The Group’s business activities together with factors likely to affect its 
future development are set out in the Chairman’s Statement and Chief 
Executive’s Review on pages 4 to 7. The financial position of the Group, 
including its cash flows and cash position, is similarly set out within the 
Chief Executive’s Review. In addition, Note 24 to the financial statements 
provides details of the Group’s financial instruments and its exposures to 
credit and liquidity risk. 
The Company’s cash position and contracted revenues together with 
the strength of its relationships with its customers lead the Directors 
to believe that the Group is well placed to manage its business risks 
successfully despite the uncertainty surrounding the current 
economic outlook. 
Having reviewed the future plans and projections for the business, the 
Directors believe that the Group has sufficient resources to continue 
operating for the foreseeable future — a period of not less than 12 
months from the date of this report. Accordingly, they continue to adopt 
the going concern basis in preparing the financial statements.
Results and dividends
The consolidated income statement is on page 20. In the light of the 
retained loss at the year end the Directors do not recommend the 
payment of a dividend.

 Corporate Governance
 Business Control Solutions Group plc
Annual Report 2008
Principles of corporate governance
The Board remains committed to maintaining high standards of 
corporate governance which it believes are vital to its business. 
The Company’s shares are traded on AIM (the Alternative Investment 
Market of the London Stock Exchange) and the Company is not required 
to comply with the provisions of the Combined Code. The Board 
continues to support the principles of the Combined Code and confirms 
that the Company seeks to comply with the Code so far as is practical 
given the size of the Group, the nature of its operations and its stage of 
development.
The Board
The Company is controlled through the Board, which at 31 December 
2008 comprised the Chairman, two Executive Directors and two Non-
Executive Directors. The Directors’ respective Committee responsibilities 
are set out in the table below:
 Audit & Risk Remuneration
 Committee Committee
Steve Russell Non-Executive Chairman Chairman Member
Nigel Walder Chief Executive — —
Roger Shepherd Finance Director — —
Simon Gulliford Non-Executive Director Member Chairman
Sandy Anderson Non-Executive Director — —
The Board has concluded that Steve Russell and Simon Gulliford are 
independent of management and free from any business or other 
relationship which could materially interfere with the exercise of their 
independent judgement. Director biographies are set out on pages 
8 and 9. Simon Gulliford is the Senior Non-Executive Director.
The Board is responsible for the Group’s system of corporate governance. 
Operational control is delegated by the Board to the Executive Directors. 
There is a formal schedule of matters reserved for the Board’s attention. 
The schedule includes activities such as acquisitions and disposals, 
material capital expenditure projects and the release of price sensitive 
information. The schedule of matters reserved for the Board is reviewed 
annually. Board and committee papers are circulated to members in 
advance of the meetings. To enable the Board to discharge its duties, 
all Directors have full and timely access to all relevant information and 
if required all Directors may take independent professional advice at the 
expense of the Group.
Under the Articles, where the Company has a five man Board, one of the 
Directors must retire by rotation each year. Accordingly, Sandy Anderson 
is seeking re-election at the forthcoming Annual General Meeting. 
Board and committees
The Board meets formally on a regular basis to discuss issues relating 
to strategy, trading performance and forecasts, resources, standards of 
conduct and risk. The number of full Board meetings and Committee 
meetings attended by each Director during the year is presented in 
the table below. The number in brackets in the table is the maximum 
number of meetings that each Director could have attended.

Audit and Risk Committee
The Company’s Audit and Risk Committee is chaired by Steve Russell, 
who as Chairman of the Audit and Risk Committee at Barclays Bank 
PLC has appropriate and recent experience. Roger Shepherd attends as 
secretary. It met two times during the year with the external Auditors 
present to review the scope of the external audit and any reports from 
the external Auditors together with the interim statement and annual 
report. The Committee is responsible for monitoring the controls 
which are in force to ensure the integrity of the information reported 
to shareholders. The Committee reviews the Company’s systems for 
assessing and managing risk and assesses the effectiveness of the 
Company’s internal control processes.
Remuneration Committee
The Remuneration Committee is responsible for making 
recommendations to the Board on the Company’s framework of 
executive remuneration and its cost. Details of its activities are included

 Corporate Governance
Nominations Committee
Currently there is no Nominations Committee and therefore the Group 
does not comply with the Combined Code in this respect. The Group 
does not feel, given their size, that there is a need for a Nominations 
Committee currently but will review the situation periodically. Matters 
relating to: succession planning; Board appointments; Non-Executive 
Director commitments; and Board composition are considered by the 
Board.
Performance evaluation
During the year the Board carried out a formal review of its own 
performance. The Company Secretary having issued a questionnaire to 
the Directors covering issues such as the effectiveness of meetings, how 
well strategy is tested and developed, Board composition, succession 
planning and risk management controls. The Company Secretary collated 
the responses and prepared a report for discussion at the Board where 
any necessary follow-up actions were identified and agreed. 
Internal control
The Board is ultimately responsible for the Group’s system of internal 
control and for reviewing its effectiveness. The Group’s system of internal 
control includes operational and compliance controls together with 
financial controls. The Board is of the view that there is an ongoing 
process in place for identifying evaluating and managing the Group’s 
significant control risks. There are no significant issues disclosed in the 
report and financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2008 
and up to the date of approval of the report and financial statements 
that have required the Board to deal with any material internal control 
issues.
In line with many companies of its size, the Group does not have an 
internal audit function. The Board consider that, given the size of the 
Group and the active day-to-day management of the Executive Directors, 
such a function would not add sufficient value.
Relations with shareholders
The Company values the views of its shareholders and recognises 
their interest in the Company’s strategy and performance. The Chief 
Executive and Finance Director hold briefing meetings with institutional 
shareholders and analysts primarily following on from both the interim 
and full year results announcements. Feedback from these meetings is 
presented to the Board. 
Communication with private shareholders is carried out through the 
annual report, interim announcement, the Company’s website 
www.bcsplc.com and the AGM. This year’s AGM will be held on 
3 June 2009.
Auditor independence
The Board has considered the independence of the external Auditors and 
has reviewed the work undertaken and fees charged. For details of the 
Auditor fees charged see note 3 to the financial statements. The Board 
receives written confirmation from the Auditors of any relationships it 
has which may cause a conflict of interest together with a declaration 
from the Auditor that it considers themselves to be independent.

Remuneration Report / Directors’ Responsibilities
 Directors’ Responsibilities in the 
Preparation of Financial Statements
The Directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report and the 
financial statements in accordance with applicable law and regulations.
UK Company law requires the Directors to prepare Group and Company 
financial statements for each financial year. Under that law the Directors 
are required to prepare Group financial statements in accordance with 
International Financial Reporting Standards (“IFRS”) as adopted by 
the EU and have elected to prepare the Company financial statements 
in accordance with United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting 
Practice (United Kingdom Accounting Standards and applicable law).
The Group financial statements are required by law and IFRS adopted 
by the EU to present fairly the financial position and performance of the 
Group; the Companies Act 1985 provides in relation to such financial 
statements that references in the relevant part of that Act to financial 
statements giving a true and fair view are references to their achieving a 
fair presentation.
The Company financial statements are required by law to give a true and 
fair view of the state of affairs of the Company. 
In preparing each of the Group and Company financial statements, the 
Directors are required to:
a. select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently;
b make judgements and estimates that are reasonable and prudent;
c. for the Group financial statements, state whether they have been 
prepared in accordance with IFRSs adopted by the EU; and for 
the Company financial statements state whether applicable UK 
accounting standards have been followed, subject to any material 
departures disclosed and explained in the Company financial 
statements; and
d prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis unless 
it is inappropriate to presume that the Group and the Company will 
continue in business.
The Directors are responsible for keeping proper accounting records 
which disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial 
position of the Company and to enable them to ensure that the financial 
statements comply with the requirements of the Companies Act 1985. 
They are also responsible for safeguarding the assets of the Group and 
hence for taking reasonable steps for the prevention and detection of 
fraud and other irregularities.
The Directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity of the 
corporate and financial information included on the Company’s website. 
Legislation in the United Kingdom governing the preparation and 
dissemination of financial statements may differ from legislation in other 
jurisdictions.

This report is made solely to the Company’s members, as a body, in 
accordance with section 235 of the Companies Act 1985. Our audit 
work has been undertaken so that we might state to the Company’s 
members those matters we are required to state to them in an Auditor’s 
report and for no other purpose. To the fullest extent permitted by law, 
we do not accept or assume responsibility to anyone other than the 
Company and the Company’s members, as a body, for our audit work, 
for this report, or for the opinions we have formed.
Respective responsibilities of Directors and Auditors
The Directors’ responsibilities for preparing the Annual Report and the 
financial statements in accordance with applicable law and International 
Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the European Union 
(“EU”), and for preparing the Parent Company financial statements 
in accordance with applicable law and United Kingdom Accounting 
Standards (United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice) are 
set out in the Statement of Directors’ Responsibilities. 
Our responsibility is to audit the financial statements in accordance with 
relevant legal and regulatory requirements and International Standards 
on Auditing (UK and Ireland). 
We report to you our opinion as to whether the financial statements 
give a true and fair view and whether the financial statements have 
been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 1985. 
We also report to you whether in our opinion the information given 
in the Directors’ Report is consistent with the financial statements. 
The information given in the Directors’ Report includes that specific 
information presented in the Chairman’s Statement and Chief Executive’s 
Review that is cross-referenced from the Business Review section in the 
Directors’ Report.
In addition we report to you if, in our opinion, the Company has 
not kept proper accounting records, if we have not received all the 
information and explanations we require for our audit, or if information 
specified by law regarding Directors’ remuneration and other 
transactions is not disclosed.
We read other information contained in the Annual Report and consider 
whether it is consistent with the audited financial statements. The 
other information comprises only the Directors’ Report, the Chairman’s 
Statement, the Chief Executive’s Review, the Corporate Governance 
Statement and the Remuneration Report. We consider the implications 
for our report if we become aware of any apparent misstatements or 
material inconsistencies with the financial statements. Our responsibilities 
do not extend to any other information.
Basis of audit opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on 
Auditing (UK and Ireland) issued by the Auditing Practices Board. An 
audit includes examination, on a test basis, of evidence relevant to the 
amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. It also includes an 
assessment of the significant estimates and judgements made by the 
Directors in the preparation of the financial statements, and of whether 
the accounting policies are appropriate to the Group’s and Company’s 
circumstances, consistently applied and adequately disclosed.
We planned and performed our audit so as to obtain all the information 
and explanations which we considered necessary in order to provide us 
with sufficient evidence to give reasonable assurance that the financial 
statements are free from material misstatement, whether caused by 
fraud or other irregularity or error. In forming our opinion we also 
evaluated the overall adequacy of the presentation of information in the 
financial statements.
Opinion
In our opinion:
• the Group financial statements give a true and fair view, in 
accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the European Union, as applied 
in accordance with the provisions of the Companies Act 1985, of the 
state of the Group’s affairs as at 31 December 2008 and of its profit 
for the year then ended;
• the Parent Company financial statements give a true and fair view, 
in accordance with United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting 
Practice, of the state of the Parent Company’s affairs as at 
31 December 2008;
• the financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance 
with the Companies Act 1985; and
• the information given in the Directors’ Report is consistent with the 
financial statements.

 Consolidated Accounting Policies
Basis of preparation
The Group’s financial statements have been prepared in accordance with IFRS and IFRICS, as adopted by the EU, and the Companies Act 1985 
applicable to companies reporting under IFRS. 
The financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention except where stated below. 
Basis of consolidation
The Group’s financial statements consolidate those of the Company and all its subsidiary undertakings as at 31 December 2008. The consolidated 
financial statements exclude any intra-group transactions.
Merger accounting
In 2005 Business Control Solutions Holdings Limited acquired the entire share capital of Business Control Solutions Software Limited (formerly Iorbia 
Limited) and The Buttonwood-Tree Group Limited through a transaction under common control, as defined in IFRS 3 Business Combinations. It is 
noted that such transactions are outside the scope of IFRS 3 and there is no other guidance elsewhere in IFRS covering such transactions.
IFRS contain specific guidance to be followed where a transaction falls outside the scope of IFRS. This guidance is included in paragraphs 10–12 
of IAS 8 ‘Accounting principles, changes in accounting estimates and errors’. This requires inter alia that where IFRS does not include guidance for 
a particular issue, the Directors may also consider the most recent pronouncements of other standard setting bodies that use a similar conceptual 
framework to develop accounting standards.
In this regard, it is noted that the UK Accounting Standards Board has, in issue, an accounting standard covering business combinations (FRS 6). This 
standard uses the principle of merger accounting. The Group has adopted the principles of FRS 6 and accounted for the combination of Business 
Control Solutions Holdings Limited, Business Control Software Limited and The Buttonwood-Tree Group Limited as a group reconstruction using the 
principles of merger accounting.
Reverse Acquisition Accounting
In 2005 the Company became the legal parent of Business Control Solutions Holdings Limited and its subsidiary companies in a share for share 
transaction. Due to the relative size of the companies, Business Control Solutions Holdings Limited shareholders became the majority (97%) 
shareholders of the enlarged share capital. Furthermore, the Company’s continuing operations and executive management were those of Business 
Control Solutions Holdings Limited. Accordingly, the substance of the combination was that Business Control Solutions Holdings Limited had acquired 
Business Control Solutions Group plc in a reverse acquisition.
Under the requirements of the Companies Act 1985, it would normally be necessary for the Company’s consolidated accounts to follow the legal 
form of the business combination. In that case the pre-combination results would be those of the acquired Business Control Solutions Group plc and 
Business Control Solutions Holdings Limited would be included only in relation to its performance from 31 May 2005. However, this would portray 
the combination as the acquisition of Business Control Solutions Holdings Limited by Business Control Solutions Group plc and would, in the opinion 
of the Directors, fail to give a true and fair view of the substance of their business combination. Accordingly, the Directors have adopted reverse 
acquisition accounting as the basis for consolidation in order to give a true and fair view.
Under reverse acquisition accounting an adjustment within shareholders funds is required to eliminate the cost of acquisition in the issuing 
Company’s books, and introduce a notional cost of acquiring the smaller issuing Company based on the fair value of its shares. The resulting 
difference has been debited to the capital reserve.
A further adjustment is required to show the share capital of the legal parent in the consolidated balance sheet rather than that of the deemed 
acquirer. The resulting adjustment is credited to other reserves.
Revenue Recognition 
Revenue represents amounts receivable net of Value Added Tax, of services provided to external customers during the year.
The Company recognises revenue once evidence of a contract or a purchase order has been obtained, services are delivered, fees are fixed or 
determinable and collection is reasonably assured.
Software solutions
The Group licenses its software on either a Perpetual Licence Fee or Annual Licence Fee basis. 
16271BUSINESS.indd   24 16271BUSINESS.indd   24 27/04/2009   14:26 27/04/2009   14:26 16271    24/04/2009      Proof 4
 Financials
25
Revenues are assigned to each clearly identifiable deliverable within the contract and revenues are then recognised as a percentage of completion of 
each of these contracted deliverables. 
Revenues from installation consultancy and training services are chargeable on a time and materials basis and are recognised when the work is 
performed. 
Revenue on installed systems maintenance is recognised over the term of the maintenance contract.
Consultancy services
Revenues from contracts for the supply of consulting services are based on a time and materials basis or a fixed price per contract. For fixed price 
contracts the Company recognises revenues as amounts become billable under the contract’s terms provided the amounts are not contingent and are 
consistent with the services delivered. 
Segmental reporting
A business segment is a distinguishable component of a Group engaged in providing products or services that are subject to risks and returns that 
are different from those of other business segments. The Group considers there to be two business segments: Consultancy Services and Software 
Solutions. The Group operates in one geographical segment, the UK, based on the location of its customers. 
Intangible assets
Research expenditure is recognised as an expense as incurred. Costs incurred on product development relating to the design, programming and 
testing of new or enhanced products are capitalised as intangible assets after considering: the probability that the development will provide economic 
benefits; its commercial and technological feasibility; resource availability; and whether costs can be measured reliably. The expenditure capitalised 
is the direct employment costs and is managed and controlled centrally. Other development costs are recognised as an expense as incurred. 
Development costs previously recognised as an expense are not recognised as an asset in a subsequent period.
Capitalised product development expenditure is stated at cost less accumulated amortisation and impairment losses. Product development costs 
capitalised are amortised from the date on which the asset is available for use on a straight-line basis over its expected useful life, which has currently 
been assessed as three years. Development assets are tested for any impairment to their carrying value on an annual basis.
Purchased software is stated at cost less accumulated amortisation and any impairment loss. Purchased software is amortised on a straight line basis 
over three years.
Trade receivables
Trade receivables are recognised initially at fair value. A provision for impairment of trade receivables is established when there is objective evidence 
that the Group will not be able to collect all amounts due according to the original contractual terms. The amount of the provision is the difference 
between the asset’s carrying value and the value of the estimated future cash flows. The amount of the provision is recognised in the income 
statement within administration expenses.
Share capital
Ordinary shares are classified as equity.
Share-based payments
The grant date fair value of options granted to employees is recognised as an employee expense, with a corresponding increase in equity, over the 
period that the employees become unconditionally entitled to the options. The total amount to be expensed over the expected life of the option is 
determined by reference to the fair value of the options granted. At each balance sheet date the Group revises its estimate of the number of options 
that are expected to vest. It recognises the impact of the revision to original estimates in the income statement with a corresponding adjustment to 
equity.
Fair value is measured using the Black–Scholes pricing model and has been adjusted for the estimated effect of non-transferrability, exercise 
restriction and behavioural considerations. 
Pension contributions
The Group operates a defined contribution stakeholder pension scheme and contributes towards personal pension contributions for certain 
employees. The cost is charged to the income statement as it is incurred.

 Consolidated Accounting Policies
Foreign currency
Transactions in foreign currencies are translated at the foreign exchange ruling at the date of the transaction. Monetary assets and liabilities 
denominated in foreign currencies at the balance sheet date are translated to pounds sterling at the foreign exchange rate ruling at that date. Foreign 
exchange differences arising on translation are recognised in the income statement. Non-monetary assets and liabilities that are measured in terms of 
historical cost in a foreign currency are translated at the exchange rate on the date of the transaction.
Interest income
Interest receivable on interest bearing financial assets is recognised on an accruals basis using the effective interest rate method. The effective interest 
rate used reflects the anticipated cash flows to be received.
Operating leases
Leases in which a significant portion of the risks and rewards of ownership are retained by the lessor are classified as operating leases. Costs in 
respect of operating leases are charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the lease term. Rent-free periods received on entering 
into a lease are accounted for over the period of the lease.
Deferred taxation
Deferred taxation is provided in full, using the liability method, on temporary differences arising between the tax bases of the assets and liabilities 
and their carrying amounts in the consolidated financial statements. However, the deferred income tax is not accounted for if it arises from the initial 
recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction other than a business combination that at the time of the transaction affects neither accounting nor 
taxable profit or loss. Deferred income tax is determined using tax rates (and laws) that have been enacted or substantially enacted by the balance 
sheet date and are expected to apply when the related deferred income asset is realised or the deferred income tax liability is settled. Deferred 
income tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profit will be available against which the temporary differences 
can be utilised.
Property, plant and equipment
All property, plant and equipment are stated at historical cost. Depreciation is provided on all property, plant and equipment at rates calculated to 
write each asset down to its estimated residual value on straight-line basis over its useful life as follows:
Furniture & Fittings  25% straight-line
Computer Equipment  25% straight-line
The assets’ residual values and useful lives are reviewed, and adjusted if appropriate, at each balance sheet date. An asset’s carrying amount is 
written down immediately to its recoverable amount if the asset’s carrying value is greater than its estimated recoverable amount. Gains and losses 
on disposals are determined by comparing the proceeds with the carrying amount and are recognised within ‘Operating Expenses’ in the income 
statement.
Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents includes cash at hand, deposits held at call with banks, and other short-term highly liquid investments with original 
maturities of three months or less.
Foreign currency translation
Items included in the financial statements of each of the Group’s entities are measured using the currency of the primary economic environment in 
which the Group operates (“the functional currency”). The consolidated financial statements are presented in sterling (“£”), which is the Company’s 
functional and presentational currency.
Foreign currency transactions are translated into the functional currency using the exchange rates prevailing at the dates of the transactions. Foreign 
exchange gains and losses resulting from the settlement of such transactions and from the translation at the year end exchange rates of monetary 
assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are recognised in the income statement.
Employee benefit trusts
The Group has established employee benefit trusts (“EBTs”) which hold shares in the Company. The Group records the assets and liabilities of the 
EBTs as its own. Own shares held are measured at cost and are deducted in arriving at shareholders’ equity and are included in a separate negative 
reserve. No gain or loss is recognised in the income statement on the sale or purchase of such shares; any gain or loss is recognised directly in equity 
attributable to the Company’s equity holders.

Factors affecting tax charge for the year:  
The tax assessed for the year is lower than the standard rate of corporation tax in the UK 28% (2007: 30%). 
The differences are explained below:   
Profit/(Loss) before tax      36,627   (399,104)
Profit/(Loss) multiplied by the standard   
rate of corporation tax in the UK 28% (2007: 30%)      10,256   (119,731)

Current tax charge for the year      —   — 
There are trading losses in the Group to carry forward of approximately £2,874,423 (2007: £2,910,000). Deferred tax on unrelieved losses 
carried forward at full corporation tax rate of 28% amounts to £774,603 (2007: £814,800) and on short-term timing differences amounts to 
£30,235 (2007: £119,000). No deferred tax asset has been recognised in respect of these losses due to the unpredictability of future profits. 
 
Analysis of deferred tax balances for financial reporting purposes:  
 
Deferred tax liabilities  
— Amounts to be settled after 12 months     (102,865)  — 
Deferred tax assets   
— Amounts due to be recovered after 12 months      102,865   — 
Net position at 31 December      —   — 
The deferred tax liability arises from the capitalisation of development costs.  
 
The deferred tax asset arises from unrelieved tax losses.

8 Profit/(loss) per share    
 Basic profit per share is calculated by dividing the Group’s profit after taxation of £36,627 (2007: loss £399,104) by the weighted average 
number of shares in issue less the  weighted average number of shares held by the EBT’s during the year of 269,689,195 (2007: 268,328,981). 
No diluted earnings per share is presented for 2007 as the effect of the exercise of share  options or warrants would be to decrease the loss per 
share.

 The warrant reserve arose from the capitalisation of debt owed by Business Control  Solutions Group plc to Thistledown Investments Limited in 
2005 in exchange for the  issue of warrants. The warrants were deemed to have been issued immediately prior to the reverse acquisition of the 
Company.    
    
 The merger reserve arises on the consolidation of Business Control Solutions Holdings  Limited’s and the Business Control Solutions Group plc’s 
subsidiary undertakings.    
    
 The capital and other reserves arise on the reverse acquisition accounting of Business  Control Solutions Group plc as described in the accounting 
policies and as follows:    
    
 The capital reserve represents the elimination of the cost of acquisition by Business Control  Solutions Group plc of Business Control Solutions 
Holdings Limited amounting to £1,900,000 and introducing a notional cost of £749,851 for the reverse acquisition of Business Control Solutions 
Group plc, based on the fair value of the shares of Business Control Solutions Limited.    
    
 The other reserve represents the adjustment required to show the share capital of the legal  parent within shareholders’ equity. It is calculated as 
the difference between the share capital  of Business Control Solutions Holdings Limited of £1,000,000 and the share capital of Business  Control 
Solutions Group plc (as reduced by the capital reduction) at 31 May 2005.

schedules, and are only  exercisable on the satisfaction of certain conditions. These options have been issued by two employee benefit trusts: 
 
 (1) Under the terms of the option agreements issued, B2B Systems Trustees Limited is  obliged to sell the shares which it holds in Business 
Control Solutions Group plc to employees of the Group.     
  As at 31 December 2008 there were 967,582 (2007: 1,351,513) options outstanding over the 1p ordinary shares in Business Control 
Solutions Group plc held by the EBT under option to employees. During the year options over  360,911 shares were issued (2007: 721,821) 
and options over 383,931 shares were exercised (2007: 1,535,650). Options over 360,911 shares lapsed during the year 
(2007: nil).   
 
 All existing options have a zero strike price.      
 (2) Under the terms of the option agreements, N Walder and his wife are obliged  to sell sufficient shares to The Buttonwood-Tree Group 
Limited employee benefit  trust to meet its obligations under options issued to employees. Any cost associated with the funding of the 
employee benefit trust is shown as a  separate reserve movement (see note 18).    
 
 At 1 January 2008 there were 9,853,575 options in existence. During the year  no further options were issued, no options were exercised 
(2007: 2,113,294) and 6,621,500 options lapsed (2007: 5,120,481).     
 The total number of options in existence as at 31 December 2008 was  3,232,075. These options have been granted subject to defined 
vesting  schedules, and are only exercisable on the satisfaction of certain conditions.

21 Equity settled share-based payments       
 Options are granted with a fixed exercise price. Options were granted during the year  with an exercise price of zero, 1p and 2.25p. The 
contractual life of all options is ten years.  Options become exercisable either at the date of grant or after one, two and three years. Options are 
valued using the Black–Scholes option-pricing model.
 The fair value of share-based payments charged to the Group profit and loss account in the year was £22,785 (2007: £161,723).

 Volatility is calculated using historical share price data over the last two years.     
  
22 Operating lease commitments    
 Operating leases relate to office facilities with lease terms of five years. The Group does  have an option to renew after five years. The Group 
does not have an option to  purchase the leased asset on expiry of the leased period.

24 Financial instruments   
 The Group’s financial instruments comprise cash, short-term loans and debtors, including  trade receivables, and creditors, including trade 
payables, that arise from its operations.  The main purpose for these financial instruments is to raise finance for the Group’s  operations. There 
was no difference between the book value and the fair value of the  financial assets and liabilities at 31 December 2008 and 
31 December 2007. 
 The Group has not entered into any derivative transactions during either period. The  Group did not enter into any hedge transactions during 
either period. The foreign  currency gains and losses recognised in the profit and loss account in either period  were immaterial.  
 
 Changes in the market interest rates of non-derivative financial instruments with fixed  interest rates only affect income if these are measured 
at fair value. As such, all financial  instruments with fixed interest rates that are carried at amortised cost are not subject to interest rate risk as 
defined in IFRS 7. Changes in market interest rates affect the  interest income or expense of non-derivative variable-interest financial instruments,  
the interest payments of which are not designated as hedged items of cash flow hedges  against interest rate risks. As a consequence, they are 
included in the calculation of income related sensitivities.   
    
 The main risks arising from the Group’s financial instruments are liquidity risks.   
    
 Financial assets   
 The Group has no financial assets, other than trade receivables as disclosed in note 12  and the amount of sterling cash at bank, earning interest at 
floating rates linked to base rates.   
    
 Financial liabilities   
 The Group’s financial liabilities, other than short-term creditors and accruals at the  year end, were as follows:   
     2008 2007
     £ £
Due within one year     —  8,726 
Due after one year     —  10,831 
Total     —  19,557 
    
 There was no interest accrued at the year end in respect of financial liabilities (2007: £nil).   
    
 Borrowing facilities   
 The Group no longer has an undrawn committed borrowing facility. The maximum  undrawn facility available (subject to sufficient qualifying trade 
debtors) as at  31 December 2008 was £nil (2007: £300,000).   
25 Capital commitments    
 The Group has no capital commitments at 31 December 2008 (2007: £nil).    
    
26 Contingent liabilities    
 The Group has no contingent liabilities as at 31 December 2008 (31 December 2007: £nil).    
    
    
27 Pension commitments    
 The Group operates a defined contribution stakeholder pension scheme and  contributes toward personal pension plans for certain employees. 
The pension cost  charge represents contributions payable by the Group and amounted to £134,434 (2007: £41,712). There was £17,200 
outstanding in respect of contributions payable to such pension schemes as at the year end (2007: £nil).

29 Accounting estimates and judgements 
 The preparation of financial statements in conformity with IFRSs requires management  to make judgements, estimates and assumptions that 
affect the reported amounts of  assets and liabilities, income and expenses. The estimates and associated assumptions are  based on historical 
experience and various other factors that are considered to be  reasonable, the results for which form the basis of making judgements about 
carrying  values of assets and liabilities that are not readily available from other sources. Actual  results may differ from these estimates. The 
estimates, assumptions and judgements  that are likely to contain the greatest degree of uncertainty are summarised below. 
Development expenditure  
The Group invests in the development of future products and in enhancing its existing  products in accordance with the accounting policy. The 
assessment as to whether each  element of this expenditure will be technically feasible, generate future economic benefit,  and the period over 
which to amortise the expenditure is a matter of judgement. 
Revenue
 Where revenue is recognised on a percentage of completion basis, management exercises  judgement in determining the percentage complete 
and the total cost of implementation.  Estimates are reviewed continually and are revised based on changes in the facts relating to  each contract. 
Income taxes
 In recognising income tax assets and liabilities estimates have to be made as to the likely  outcome of decisions by tax authorities on transactions 
and events whose outcomes are  uncertain and on the expected manner of realisation or settlement of deferred tax assets and liabilities. 
Useful lives
 Intangible assets and property, plant and equipment are expensed over their estimated  useful lives. The period of actual use or economic benefit 
may differ from these estimated lives. 
Share options
The assumptions used in calculating the charge are disclosed in note 21.

 Company Accounting Policies
Basis of accounting    
These financial statements have been produced under the historical cost convention in accordance with applicable accounting standards.  
  
Fixed asset investments    
Fixed asset investments are stated at cost less any provision for permanent impairment in value.    
    
Deferred taxation    
Deferred taxation is recognised in respect of all timing differences that have originated and not reversed at the balance sheet date where transactions 
or events that result in an obligation to pay more tax in the future or a right to pay less tax in the future have occurred at the balance sheet date. 
Timing differences are differences between the Company’s taxable profits and its results as stated in the financial statements that arise from the 
inclusion of gains and losses in tax assessments in periods different from those in which they are recognised in the financial statements.  
  
Deferred tax is measured at the average of tax rates that are expected to apply in the periods in which timing differences are expected to reverse, 
based on tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantially enacted by the balance sheet date. Deferred tax is measured on a non-
discounted basis.    
    
Pension contributions    
The Company contributes towards personal pension plans for certain employees. The cost of contributions is charged in the profit and loss account 
as incurred.    
    
Share-based payments    
The grant date fair value of options granted to employees is recognised as an employee expense, with a corresponding increase in equity over the 
period that the employees become unconditionally entitled to the options. The amount recognised as an expense is adjusted to reflect the actual 
number of share options that vest.    
    
In the Company financial statements equity settled share-based payments issued to its own employees are recognised in the income statement with 
a corresponding increase in equity. Equity settled share-based payments issued to employees of subsidiary undertakings are treated in the financial 
statements of the Company as an increase in investment in subsidiary companies, together with a corresponding increase in equity, over the vesting 
period based on the Group’s estimate of shares which will eventually vest.    
    
Fair value is measured using the Black–Scholes option model and has been adjusted for the estimated effect of non-transferability, exercise restrictions 
and behavioural considerations. 
Corresponding amounts    
The Company has adopted the requirements of UITF 44 “Group and Treasury Share Transactions” which was effective for accounting periods 
beginning on or after 1 March 2007.    
    
On adoption of this standard, the comparative figures have been restated with an amount of £404,926 now being included within investments, 
having been taken from inter-company debtors. In the current year the addition to investments was £22,785.

Shares held by them up to an aggregate nominal amount of £904,687.40 provided that this authority shall expire at the conclusion of 
the next Annual General Meeting of the Company following the passing of this resolution, save that the Company may before such 
expiry make offers or agreements which would or might require relevant securities of the Company to be allotted after such expiry and 
the Directors may allot relevant securities in pursuance of such offers or agreements notwithstanding that the authority conferred by this 
resolution has expired.

meaning of Sections 94(2) to 94(3A) of the Act) for cash pursuant to the authority conferred by resolution 6 as if Section 89(1) of the Act did 
not apply to any such allotment provided that this power shall be limited to:
7.1 the allotment of equity securities in connection with a rights issue in favour of or general offer to all shareholders in the Company where 
the equity securities respectively attributable to the interests of all shareholders in the Company are proportionate (as nearly as may be)

Directors may deem necessary or expedient to deal with problems under the laws of any territory or the requirements of any regulatory 
body or any stock exchange in any territory or in connection with fractional entitlements or otherwise howsoever); and

the Directors of the Company may allot equity securities in pursuance of such offer or agreement as if the power conferred by this 
resolution had not expired.

Notice of Annual General Meeting
Notes 
1. As a member entitled to attend, speak and vote at the Annual General Meeting (“AGM”) you may appoint one or more proxies to exercise all or 
any of your rights to attend, speak and vote. A proxy need not be a member of the Company but must attend the AGM to represent you. A form 
of proxy is enclosed for use by members. You can only appoint a proxy using the procedures set out in these Notes. Details of how to appoint 
the Chairman of the AGM or another person as your proxy using the form of proxy are set out in the notes to the form of proxy. If you wish 
your proxy to speak on your behalf at the AGM you will need to appoint your own choice of proxy (not the Chairman) and give your instructions 
directly to them. 
2. You may appoint more than one proxy provided each proxy is appointed to exercise rights attached to different shares. You may not appoint 
more than one proxy to exercise rights attached to any one share. To appoint more than one proxy please photocopy this form. If multiple forms 
are submitted please send these in one envelope to Capita Registrars, Proxy Department, The Registry, 34 Beckenham Road, Beckenham, Kent, 
BR3 4TU.
3. Subject to the following principles, where more than one proxy is appointed, where a form of proxy does not state the number of shares to 
which it applies (a “blank proxy”) then that proxy is deemed to have been appointed in relation to the total number of shares registered in 
your name (the “member’s entire holding”). In the event of a conflict between a blank proxy and a form of proxy which does state the number 
of shares to which it applies (a “specific proxy”), the specific proxy shall be counted first, regardless of the time it was sent or received (on the 
basis that as far as possible, the conflicting forms of proxy should be judged to be in respect of different shares) and remaining shares will be 
apportioned to the blank proxy (pro rata if there is more than one).
4. Where there is more than one proxy appointed and the total number of shares in respect of which proxies are appointed is no greater than your 
entire holding, it is assumed that proxies are appointed in relation to different shares, rather than that conflicting appointments have been made 
in relation to the same shares. When considering conflicting proxies, later proxies will prevail over earlier proxies, and which proxy is later will be 
determined on the basis of which proxy is last delivered. Proxies in the same envelope will be treated as sent and delivered at the same time, to 
minimise the number of conflicting proxies.
5. If conflicting proxies are sent or delivered at the same time in respect of (or deemed to be in respect of) your entire holding, none of them shall 
be treated as valid.
6. Where the aggregate number of shares in respect of which proxies are appointed exceeds your entire holding and it is not possible to determine 
the order in which they were sent or delivered (or they were all sent or delivered at the same time), the number of votes attributed to each proxy 
will be reduced pro rata (on the basis that as far as possible, conflicting forms of proxy should be judged to be in respect of different shares). 
Where this gives rise to fractions of shares, such fractions will be rounded down.
7. If you appoint a proxy or proxies and then decide to attend the AGM in person and vote, on a poll, using your poll card, then your vote in person 
will override the proxy vote(s). If your vote in person is in respect of your entire holding then all proxy votes will be disregarded. If, however, you 
vote at the AGM in respect of less than your entire holding, if you indicate on your polling card that all proxies are to be disregarded, that shall 
be the case; but if you do not specifically revoke proxies, then your vote in person will be treated in the same way as if it were the last delivered 
proxy and earlier proxies will only be disregarded to the extent that to count them would result in the number of votes being cast exceeding your 
entire holding.
8. In relation to Note 7 above, in the event that you do not specifically revoke proxies, it will not be possible for the Company to determine your 
intentions in this regard. However, in light of the aim to include votes wherever and to the fullest extent possible, it will be assumed that earlier 
proxies should continue to apply to the fullest extent possible.

Notice of Annual General Meeting
9. A vote withheld is not a vote in law, which means that the vote will not be counted in the calculations of votes for or against the resolution. If 
you enter either the ‘Discretionary’ option or if no voting indication is given, your proxy will vote or abstain from voting at his or her discretion. 
Your proxy will vote (or abstain from voting) as he or she thinks fit in relation to any other matter which is put before the AGM. 
10. To be valid a completed and signed form of proxy and, if applicable, any authority under which it is signed, or a certified copy of such authority, 
must be deposited with Capita Registrars, Proxy Department, The Registry, 34 Beckenham Road, Beckenham, Kent, BR3 4TU not less than 
48 hours (excluding, in the calculation of such time period, any part of a day that is not a working day) before the time fixed for holding the 
AGM or adjourned AGM. Completion and return of a form of proxy will not prevent a member from attending and voting in person at the 
AGM should he so wish. 
11. In the case of joint holders, where more than one of the joint holders purports to appoint a proxy, only the appointment submitted by the most 
senior holder will be accepted. Seniority is determined by the order in which the names of the joint holders appear in the Company’s register of 
members in respect of the joint holding (the first-named being the most senior).
12. To change your proxy instructions simply submit a new proxy appointment using the methods set out above. Note that the cut-off time for 
receipt of proxy appointments (see Note 10 above) also applies in relation to amended instructions; any amended proxy appointment received 
after the relevant cut-off time will be disregarded.
13. In order to revoke a proxy instruction you will need to inform the Company by sending a signed hard copy notice clearly stating your intention 
to revoke your proxy appointment to Capita Registrars at the address set out in Note 10 above. In the case of a member which is a Company, 
the revocation notice must be executed under its common seal or signed on its behalf by an officer of the Company or an attorney for the 
Company. Any power of attorney or any other authority under which the revocation notice is signed (or a duly certified copy of such power 
or authority) must be included with the revocation notice. The revocation notice must be received by Capita Registrars no later than 24 hours 
before the time fixed for the AGM. If you attempt to revoke your proxy appointment but the revocation is received after the time specified then 
your proxy appointment will remain valid.
14. In order to facilitate voting by corporate representatives at the AGM, arrangements will be put in place at the AGM so that:
14.1 if a corporate member has appointed the Chairman of the AGM as its corporate representative with instructions to vote on a poll in 
accordance with the directions of all the other corporate representatives for that member at the AGM, then, on a poll, those corporate 
representatives will give voting directions to the Chairman and the Chairman will vote (or withhold a vote) as corporate representative in 
accordance with those directions; and
14.2 if more than one corporate representative for the same corporate member attends the AGM but the corporate member has not 
appointed the Chairman of the AGM as its corporate representative, a designated corporate representative will be nominated, from those 
corporate representatives who attend, who will vote on a poll and the other corporate representatives will give voting directions to that 
designated corporate representative.
 Corporate members are referred to the guidance issued by the Institute of Chartered Secretaries and Administrators on proxies and corporate 
representatives – www.icsa.org.uk – for further details of this procedure. The guidance includes a sample form of representation letter to 
appoint the Chairman as a corporate representative as described in Note 14.1 above.

15. Pursuant to regulation 41 (1) of the Uncertificated Securities Regulations 2001 (2001 No. 3755) the Company has specified that only those 
members registered on the register of members of the Company at 6 p.m. on 1st June 2009 shall be entitled to attend and vote at the AGM 
(or if the AGM is adjourned, at 6 p.m. on the day two days prior to the adjourned meeting) in respect of the number of Ordinary Shares 
registered in their name at that time. Changes to the register of members after 6 p.m. on 1st June 2009 shall be disregarded in determining the 
rights of any person to attend and vote at the AGM.
16. The following documents will be available for inspection at the Registered Office of the Company from the date of this Notice of AGM until the 
time of the AGM and for at least 15 minutes prior to the AGM and during the AGM:

16.2 a schedule showing the terms of appointment of the Non-Executive Directors of the Company; and
16.3 copies of the proposed new Articles of Association of the Company, together with copies of the existing Articles of Association marked to 
show the changes being proposed.

of communication will be accepted). You may not use any electronic address provided either:

Notes on filling in your form of proxy
1. As a shareholder of the Company, you have a right to go to, speak at and vote at the AGM. If you cannot or do not want to go to the meeting, but still want to vote you can appoint one or 
more persons to go to the meeting and speak and vote instead of you. That person is known as a “proxy”. You can only use this form and the procedures set out in these notes to appoint the 
Chairman or someone else as your proxy.
2. Your proxy does not have to be a shareholder of the Company. 
3. If you want to appoint the Chairman as your proxy, insert “Chairman” in the space above. If you want to nominate someone other than the Chairman as your proxy, give that person’s name in 
the space above. Your proxy must then go to the meeting to vote on your behalf. However, if you do this and you, or your proxy, do not go to the meeting, your vote cannot be counted.
4. You may appoint more than one proxy provided each is appointed to exercise rights attached to different shares. You may not appoint more than one proxy to exercise rights attached on any 
one share. To appoint more than one proxy, please refer to the notes to the Notice of AGM.
5. In the case of joint holders, the vote of the senior shareholder who tenders a vote, whether in person or by proxy, will be accepted to the exclusion of the votes of the other joint holders. For 
this purpose, seniority is determined by the order in which the names appear in the register of members in respect of the joint holding.
6. If someone signs this form for you, when you or that person send the form back to us, you or they must enclose the authority under which the form is signed. If you are appointing the proxy 
for a Company, the form must show the Company’s seal or be signed on its behalf by an officer, attorney or other person authorised to sign for the Company. Where an officer signs this form, 
the signatory should state his or her office on the form.
7. For the proxy named in this form to act for you, your completed form must be completed and lodged with the Company’s Registrars, Capita Registrars, at The Registry, 34 Beckenham Road, 
Beckenham, Kent BR3 4TU by 11.00 am on 1st June 2009 or at least 48 hours (excluding, in the calculation of such time period, any part of a day that is not a working day) before any 
adjourned meeting. Please do not enclose anything else with your form (except for the authority mentioned in Note 5 above where appropriate). If your form arrives late, it will not be valid and 
will not replace any earlier form of proxy we have received. We cannot accept forms of proxy returned by fax.
8. Entitlement to attend and vote at the meeting or at any adjourned meeting and the number of votes you can cast, will be determined by reference to the shareholder register at 6.00 p.m. on 
1st June 2009 or, if the meeting is adjourned, 6.00 p.m. on the day two days before the date fixed for such an adjourned meeting.
9. If you send a form of proxy, you can still go to the meeting and vote.
10. Please refer to the notes to the Notice of AGM for details of the procedure that will be followed if multiple forms of proxy are received. 
11. If you make any alterations on this form, you must put your initials next to them. 
12. A shareholder which is a Company may appoint a corporate representative to attend the meeting, speak and vote on its behalf. To do so, the Company must submit a form of resolution giving 
the relevant authority to that corporate representative. A corporate representative so appointed has the same powers on behalf of the Company he/she represents as that Company would have 
were it an individual member.
13. For details of how to change your proxy instructions or revoke your proxy appointment please refer to the notes to the Notice of AGM.

“The Directors believe
that Isotron’s acquisition
of the Gammaster Group
will, at a step, create a
multinational group of
companies at the
forefront of contract
sterilisation in Western
Europe.  The enlarged
Group will comprise the
largest chain of European
contract sterilisation sites
with facilities in Europe, 
South East Asia and 
South Africa.”

Results
The results for the full year were in line with
our expectations at the time of making the
Gammaster acquisition.
Group turnover rose to £22.2m (2001:
£15.0m) with £5.4m coming from the
acquisition of Gammaster in January 2002.
Sales from existing operations rose 12%
with most of the gain coming from the
medical sector.  Operating profits rose by
21% to £5.0m (2001: £4.1m) after charging
£0.2m of integration costs and £0.5m of
goodwill amortisation.   Gammaster was
consolidated into the Isotron accounts for
24 weeks of the year (period since
acquisition on 16 January).
The interest payable reflects the borrowings
taken out at mid-year to fund the
acquisition of Gammaster.  Earnings per
share after amortisation and exceptional
expenses were 18.7p (2001: 25.3p) and
before amortisation and exceptional
expenses were 22.4p (2001: 25.3p).
Your board is recommending an
unchanged final dividend of 5.00p giving a
total of 7.94p for the full year (2001: 7.94p).
Board of Directors
We were pleased to welcome Paul
Santing, ex President of Gammaster, to
the Board in January 2002.  He is based
in Holland and is responsible primarily for
our interests in Holland, France and
Germany.  We were also pleased to
welcome George Kennedy, a former main
board Director of Smiths Industries and a
former Chairman of their medical division.
He joined the Board as a non-executive
Director in April 2002.  Charles Fitzherbert
retired from the Board in June 2002.  
I would like to thank Charles for his
invaluable contributions to the Board over
many years.  We are seeking to make a
further non-executive appointment in the
coming months.  
Outlook
In the new financial year Isotron is focused
on driving additional volume through its
recently expanded capacity, and
maximising the benefits from acquiring the
businesses of Gammaster.  The main
market of medical sterilisation remains
strong,  and we are planning for significant
growth from our Asian investments.

Operations
The year has been dominated by the
acquisition of Gammaster, which has
transformed Isotron into the market
leader for contract sterilisation in
Europe and Asia.  The purchase was
completed in mid-January, since
when the improved international
network has already begun to show
benefits.  A substantial multi-year
contract has been signed with a
European based customer who is
expected to take up most of the
spare capacity of our Thailand plant
as well as provide new volume for
Europe. 
The integration of Gammaster has
progressed well with changes to
the management structure
complete and the extension of the
Isotron brand across the new
territories now being implemented.
Ireland was the only country with
management overlap and the two
sites are now firmly under one
management.
The year has been
dominated by the
acquisition of Gammaster
We had new investments
coming on stream in three
locations
In the summer of 2001 we had new
investments coming on stream in three
locations.  
The gamma plant in Malaysia began trading
in August and has had a very successful
first year of operation.  This plant was
established as part of a multi-year contract
with a major customer and is now starting
to process volumes from other customers
in the region.  The ethylene oxide lines at
that plant were commissioned in the last
quarter of the year and customer validations
were progressing at the year-end.
The new electron beam plant at Daventry
has also been running successfully since
August 2001 and volumes built quickly to
one shift a day.
Three new ethylene oxide lines were
brought on stream in Ireland. They have
contributed to profits in the year not only by
processing new volumes but also by
improving processing efficiency across the
whole site. 7.0 chief executive’s review
John Barker, Chief Executive  Isotron plc annual report and accounts 2002 8.0
Operations continued
A successful refurbishment of the
Bradford gamma plant (origin 1978)
involving a complete replacement of all
the machinery and control systems was
carried out mid-year. The result is a
plant with more capacity and better
efficiency as well as up to date control
and safety systems.
Following the consolidation of Isotron
and Gammaster, the new Group is now
managed primarily on a regional basis.
However, to drive forward the benefits
derived from the larger Group a number
of senior corporate managers have
been appointed with specific Group
responsibilities, for example to develop
multinational marketing.  All these
positions have been filled by existing
staff.  A General Manager will be
appointed to be responsible for all UK
operations. This is a key role with the
UK generating approximately 40% of
Group revenue.
Markets in the year
The core business of the enlarged Group
continues to be medical – the contract
sterilisation of single use disposables,
and we were successful in securing new
medical volumes in Ireland and Malaysia
in particular.  The biological market, more
heavily represented in mainland Europe,
is focused particularly on packaging for
the food and healthcare industries.  In
the UK this market was flat but in
mainland Europe volumes were higher.
The chemical market was significantly
down during the year with the telecoms
and electrical engineering industries hit
by the economic downturn in these
sectors.  However, signs of a tentative
improvement in these areas were starting
to show in the summer of 2002.

our skilled team will provide the most effective
sterilisation solutions. 
As noted earlier Isotron’s key market is
associated with the healthcare industry,
in particular with sterile medical
devices.  Isotron’s customers serve
markets across the globe although the
majority of output is destined for
Europe, with North America being the
next most important geographical
region.  Key manufacturers in the
industry are reporting annual growth
rates in the range of 5-12%, this range
hiding some extreme variations.  Those
in the novel product sectors such as
orthopaedic implants and stents show
growth in the 20-25% range whilst
those focused on the commodity end of
the product range are reporting more
modest growth rates.  Isotron’s
customer base is drawn from across
the range of manufacturers in this
industry.
Across the new Group we have in
excess of 1,000 customers with the
largest accounting for less than 5% of
turnover. In recent years sales prices
have generally been weak however,
during the year under review, some
price increases were implemented in the
UK and Ireland.  Selling prices will be
influenced by local conditions but
increasingly agreements with customers
operating on a multinational basis will
be set in an international context.
During the second half-year we
developed a number of initiatives which
has resulted in a significant new
contract focused on South East Asia.
The capabilities we now possess for
processing in Malaysia, Thailand and
across Europe provide a very strong
market position for the future.

United Kingdom
The Group has a broad technology base
in the UK, comprising five gamma
radiation plants, three high energy
electron beam processing units, one
ethylene oxide facility and two
microbiological laboratories. We also
operate a pathology laboratory based in
South Wales. The processing site at
Daventry, Northamptonshire, is the only
dual technology sterilisation facility in the
UK, following the commissioning of a
new 10 MeV electron beam alongside the
gamma radiation plant.  The sterilisation
of medical devices represents the UK’s
primary market sector.  The UK remains
an important location for the
development and manufacture of
healthcare products.
Ireland
The Group’s presence in Ireland is located
on two sites at Tullamore, Co. Offaly, and
Westport, Co Mayo.  Westport specialises
in gamma radiation whilst Tullamore
provides EtO sterilisation complemented
by a significant microbiological testing
laboratory. Business in Ireland is
dominated by large, American
multinational companies that have
established major European manufacturing
sites over the past twenty years.  Ireland
offers, in particular, low corporate taxes
and an educated work force that is
technologically adept and adaptable.  The
medical market is expected to continue to
grow providing further opportunity to
develop Isotron’s service offering and
presence in the market.

Rest of Europe 
Isotron has gamma processing plants near
Munich in Germany and Marseille in France,
and three gamma plants located at two
sites in Holland; Ede near the German
border, and Etten-Leur near the Belgian
border. In addition to their national markets
these plants service customers from Spain,
Italy, the Czech Republic, Slovakia and
Belgium. In Sweden Isotron operates both
gamma and electron beam facilities. The
gamma plant is uneconomical and will be
closed in the new financial year. The
electron beam plant caters for the medical
and electronic industries. A growing
network of plants, located near major
arterial routes, enables the Company 
to satisfy its customers’ needs 
as they expand.
Asia and Africa
Isotron operates a dual technology
facility with both gamma and EtO plants
near Penang, Malaysia, and a gamma
plant near Bangkok in Thailand.  These
two facilities, which have been built
within the last three years, service a
growing number of major multinational
organisations with manufacturing
facilities located in the region. Isotron’s
gamma plant in South Africa is sited near
Johannesburg and is the largest contract
facility in the country.

Critical mass
The increased size of the Isotron
Group, and its geographical spread,
has resulted in a strong organisation
that offers a multinational service.
The business is focused primarily
around sterilisation or microbial
control and Isotron seeks to be the
partner of choice in the provision of
these services.  The steadiness of
the healthcare market provides a
solid platform for Isotron’s business
in each country.   Isotron plc annual report and accounts 2002 12.0
Plant design
Isotron continues to invest in state-of-the-art
processing plant and technologies.  Each
investment requires an initial multi-million
pound outlay thereby creating a high fixed
cost base. The speed at which initial
revenues are generated is therefore of key
concern to management when making
investment decisions.
Isotron operates well established and proven
technologies.  The investments are designed
to be operated for many years and
technological developments are
incorporated as part of planned upgrade
and improvement programmes.
The in-house expertise that comes from the
newly enlarged Group means that any new
facility can be tailor made for the country
and types of products to be treated.  The
nature of the processes and sophistication
of equipment result in there being a trade-off
between cost efficiency and flexibility.    
Isotron has an engineering section that
controls the building of new facilities.  In
some cases the plant will be supplied as a
turnkey project. Isotron now has the
capability to design and assemble the
necessary plant, and manage installation 
in-house.
Quality standards
Each of Isotron’s sites is certified to comply
with the quality standards that are required
for medical device and pharmaceutical
manufacture.  The facilities comply with
international and national standards
including ISO 9002, EN46002 and others
as appropriate.  For example Isotron
complies with EN550 for ethylene oxide
processing and EN552 for radiation
sterilisation.  Inspections by Notified Bodies
ensure compliance with standards and
guidelines applicable to the countries and
regions in which Isotron operates. In
addition Isotron is subject to inspection by
the FDA in relation to products being
manufactured for the North American
market.  In-house experts participate on
various national and international technical
and specialist committees that continuously
develop these standards and set the levels
of technical excellence for the industry.

chief executive’s review continued
pharmaceutical

Technology 13.0 chief executive’s review
Healthcare manufacturers operate in a
highly regulated environment and are
keenly aware of developments amongst
their regulators and the potential
consequent impact upon their
businesses.  For example it has been
recently announced that the regulatory
body in the UK, the Medical Devices
Agency (MDA) is to merge with the
Medicines Control Agency (MCA).  
There is concern that this development
could lead to the application of
pharmaceutical industry controls to
medical devices, a development which
could impact on manufacturing cost,
product development lead times and
industry flexibility.  The progress in
mutual recognition of inspection bodies
in Europe by the Food and Drugs
Administration (FDA) however, offers the
prospect of simplification, and potentially
reduction, in the number of replicated
quality inspections performed by
international bodies.  Isotron was subject
to joint FDA/BSI inspection during the
year as part of the development of the
Mutual Recognition Agreement.
Technical support services
The Group offers a variety of laboratory
services to help customers satisfy
regulatory requirements.  Working in
partnership with customers, Isotron
develops procedures to demonstrate
that Isotron’s customers are complying
with the relevant national or international
standards.  Additionally, Isotron provides
technical support services for product
development or manufacturing activities.
Isotron’s input might include advice on
the choice of materials, validation of the
sterilisation method and the assessment
of some aspects of the manufacturing
environment.

Market diversity
Each market segment served by Isotron
requires a process solution appropriate to
the products and the markets in which they
are used.  Isotron has at its disposal a
range of process capabilities to satisfy the
diverse demands from each unique market
segment. This capability is one of the
important factors that differentiates Isotron
from other European contract service
providers. The expertise gained in working
with the key players in each of the market
segments will enable knowledge to be
diffused across the organisation which can
be applied to enhance customer
satisfaction.
Healthcare
Within the customer base, the most
important is the segment encompassing
the manufacturers of single-use sterile
medical devices.  Products processed
include such items as surgeons’ gloves,
scalpel blades, surgical drapes and
gowns used in operating theatres and
various disposable items including
catheters and needles.  The manufacturers
of these products place heavy demands 
on the quality systems and operating
procedures to ensure they satisfy
international and national standards. 
The same sterilisation processes are 
utilised in some applications within the
pharmaceutical industry. Finished products,
containers, cap and closures are all
represented within the products and
components passing through facilities.
Similarly, pharmaceutical ingredients,
excipients, and raw materials may be
processed with ‘sub sterilisation’ treatments
in order to ensure a low and controlled
microbiological profile before use by the
manufacturer. As with medical devices,
pharmaceutical manufacturers place similar,
and in some instances more complex,
demands on quality and production systems.
The manufacture of the majority of
pharmaceuticals is controlled by various
licensing systems, and manufacturers require
that Isotron in turn holds appropriate licences
and is subject to relevant inspection.
Isotron has at its disposal
a range of process
capabilities to satisfy the
diverse demands from
each unique market

Other market sectors also have
requirements to reduce and control
microbiological contamination in order to
protect the product or the end user.
Examples include mascara brushes from the
cosmetic industry (to avoid introducing
contamination close to the eye). Similarly
within the food packaging industry, dairy
product containers may be treated to control
contamination in order to ensure shelf life.
The industry has been trying to resolve a
number of issues, for example over the
ongoing challenge to DEHP , the plasticiser
used in the vast majority of medical grade
PVC, and the ongoing debate over the re-
use of single use items.  The former
impacts on a material, which through its
versatility has become a cornerstone of the
medical device industry.  The latter is a
practice developed in some cases in
response to the perceived cost of single
use devices, but in many instances does
not recognise the ethical issues as well as
the risks and potential legal costs
associated with the practice of re-use.

Polymer modification
A market segment of importance to
Isotron utilises the same process
(irradiation) but for a completely different
application.  In this instance the
requirement is not to eliminate or lower the
microbiological profile but to modify the
properties of different polymers.
Processing PVC covered wire under an
electron beam alters the physical structure
at the molecular level making it more
resistant to heat and abrasion.  This
process, known as cross-linking, is also
used to induce the memory effect in heat
shrink tubing.  The markets to which this
application is relevant include automotive,
printing, telecoms and semiconductors. 
Laboratory testing
Frequently customers will require
assistance in the area of microbiological
testing and analysis.  Isotron employs
microbiologists with the skills to develop
test regimes and methodologies to support
Isotron’s customers. These laboratory
services are particularly concerned with
providing data to demonstrate the efficacy of
the sterilisation process. Furthermore the
laboratory provides an extensive range of
support services for smaller manufacturers
with limited in-house capabilities. These may
include training, audit, and environmental
analysis. 
Finally, through JMJ Laboratories, the Group
provides pathology test services to the
occupational health sector. Applications
would include routine health screens as well
as testing for drug abuse among key
workers in safety critical industries. Isotron plc annual report and accounts 2002 16.0
Financial results
The acquisition of Gammaster, the
commissioning of two new plants and an
expansion of our EtO facilities in Ireland have
heavily influenced the results for the year.
Turnover from existing operations increased
by 12% despite difficult trading conditions
encountered by some of our UK businesses.
The increase in costs reflects both the
expansion in our operating base and the
introduction of the Gammaster companies.
The Group incurred exceptional costs
associated with the integration of the new
business in addition to costs associated with
the amortisation of goodwill. The overall
financial structure of the business has also
changed during the year resulting in net
interest payable. The Group adopted FRS
19, deferred tax, at the half year and the
deferred tax liability is now determined on a
full provision basis.  Despite all the changes
referred to above, the Group performed in
line with management expectations.
Acquisition
On 16 January 2002 the acquisition of
Gammaster was completed. The transaction
was funded from both equity and debt, with
shareholders contributing £22.2m, net of 
share issue costs, and the remaining cost was
raised in the form of bank loans and credit
facilities. The consideration for Gammaster
was £37.7m, which included acquisition costs
of £3.3m.  The resulting provisional goodwill, of
£19.9m, is being amortised over 20 years. 
The majority of the Gammaster companies 
are 100% owned except for the operations in
Germany and Thailand where minority
shareholders hold 37.5% and 8% interests
respectively.
Cash flow 
The Group generated £9.7m from operating
activities and invested £8.0m on new tangible
assets of which £3.4m relates to the purchase
of cobalt 60 and £4.6m to additions to plant,
machinery and buildings. Capital expenditure
during the year was higher reflecting the
substantial increase in operating capacity. The
purchase of Gammaster involved a net cash
outflow of £28.0m.  Following the acquisition
the Group’ s cash flow is now generated in 6
different currencies. As a consequence cash
management and the inter-relationship
between taxation, foreign exchange and
interest rate movements is now more
significant to the overall performance of the
business.

Debt
The net debt position at the year end was
£15.8m. This comprised £3.7m of cash
and £19.5m of loans and overdraft. A 
7 year Term Loan was obtained to fund the
debt portion of the Gammaster acquisition.
Repayment of the loan commenced in July
2002. In addition to the Term Loan, a
Working Capital Facility has been obtained.
Debts, which were established to part fund
the construction of the new facilities in
Malaysia, are still outstanding and will be
repaid over the next 7 years. The acquired
debt in Germany and South Africa has
been retained.
Foreign exchange and interest rates
The Group’s main foreign exchange
exposure relates to the translation of the net
investment in subsidiaries. Wherever
possible borrowings have been matched to
the assets and income streams to which
they relate thereby mitigating exposure to
exchange rate movements. An interest rate
hedge has been taken out on 50% of the
borrowing used to fund the acquisition. The
interest rate hedge covers a period of three
years to July 2005.
T axation
The Group adopted FRS 19, deferred tax,
at the half year. This resulted in the
recognition of a £1.9m additional deferred
tax liability relating to prior years. The
Group now fully provides for deferred tax.
The tax rate applicable to Group
companies varies in each territory.
Ireland’s rate of corporation tax remains
low at 10%, whilst in certain Euro zone
countries the rates exceed 30%. 
The overall tax charge is 29% of 
pre tax profits.
Systems & internal controls
The expansion of the Group and the
increase of both employees and operating
locations has required that we focus on
financial and administration systems.  Our
aim is to provide timely, accurate and
consistent information.  We made good
progress during the year and will continue
to review and monitor our systems via a
programme of internal audit.

pages 27 to 29.  No changes took place in the interests of Directors in the
Company’s shares between 30 June 2002 and 4 September 2002.
Significant shareholdings
The Company had been notified that as at 4 September 2002, the
following held, managed, advised, or were able to control 3% or more of
the issued share capital of the Company as set out on the following
page.  So far as the Directors are aware as at 4 September 2002 there are
no other notifiable interests in the issued share capital of the Company.
Isotron plc annual report and accounts 2002 22.0
The Directors have pleasure in presenting the Annual Report and
audited financial statements for the year ended 30 June 2002.
Principal activity and business review
Isotron provides industry with the specialist services of microbial
contamination control and the modification of polymers.  During the year
Isotron completed the acquisition of the Gammaster Group, a leading
European provider of gamma irradiation sterilisation services.  The new
enlarged Group, with eighteen processing facilities, makes Isotron the
European market leader in this field and a major player on the world stage.
Comments on the results for the year and future outlook are
contained within the Chairman’s Statement, Chief Executive’s Review
and Financial Review set out on pages 4 to 18.
Dividends
The Directors propose that a final dividend of 5.00p (2001: 5.00p) per
ordinary share be paid in respect of the year ended 30 June 2002.
The recommended final dividend, if approved, will be paid on 
15 November 2002 to those shareholders whose names appear on the
Register of Members at the close of business on 18 October 2002.
The final dividend, together with the interim dividend of 2.94p (2001: 2.94p)
per ordinary share paid on 26 April 2002, amounts to a total dividend of
7.94p (2001: 7.94p) per ordinary share in respect of the year ended 30 June
2002.  The total dividends declared and proposed in respect of the year
amount to £1,673k (2001: £1,014k) reflecting the increase in the equity base.
Directors
The current Directors of the Company are shown on page 19.  Paul
Santing was appointed to the Board as an Executive Director on 28
January 2002.  George Kennedy was appointed to the Board as a Non-
Executive Director on 25 April 2002.  As they have both been appointed
since the last AGM they will both retire in accordance with the Company’s
Articles of Association and, being eligible, offer themselves for re-election.

Employees
The Group has always recognised the importance of good communication
and relations with its employees.  Employees are kept informed of activities
which are of concern to them or which are likely to affect their interests
through meetings, e-mail and the company’s intranet.
The Company operates a Savings Related Share Option Scheme in which
employees within the UK are invited to participate.  Company share
options are offered to Managers on a regular basis.  It is the policy of the
Group to give full and fair consideration to applications for employment
from disabled persons and to continue, wherever possible, the
employment of staff who may become disabled.
Market value of land
Land is recorded in the books at cost.  The Directors believe that the market
value of land exceeds the carrying value.
Payment of suppliers
The Group does not follow any code or standard on payment practice; terms
and conditions are agreed individually with suppliers.  Payment is then made
in accordance with these terms, subject to the terms and conditions being
met by the supplier.  At 30 June 2002 the average number of days credit
taken by the Group for trade purchases was 39 days (Company: 47 days). 
Donations
During the year the Group made charitable donations of £2k (2001: £2k).
There were no political donations.
Annual General Meeting
This year’s Annual General Meeting will be held at Swissôtel London 
The Howard, Temple Place, London WC2R 2PR at 12.00 noon on 
6 November 2002.  The notice of meeting is on pages 58 to 59 of this
document.  
Auditors
A resolution is to be proposed at the forthcoming Annual General
Meeting to reappoint KPMG Audit Plc as auditors of the Company at a
fee to be determined by the Directors.
Special Business
Resolutions 6 to 9 set out in the notice of Annual General Meeting
constitute special business.  
Resolution 6. This resolution, which will be proposed as an ordinary
resolution, is to re-elect Christopher Thompson who, being over the age
of 70, retires and offers himself for re-election.
Resolution 7. Your Directors may only allot shares or grant rights over
shares if authorised to do so by shareholders.  The authority granted at
the last Annual General Meeting is due to expire at this year’s Annual
General Meeting.  Accordingly, Resolution 7 will be proposed as an
ordinary resolution to grant a new authority to allot unissued share
capital up to an aggregate nominal value of £32,499, representing the
total authorised but unissued ordinary share capital as at 30 June 2002.
If given, this authority will expire at the Annual General Meeting in 2003
or on 5 February 2004, whichever is the earlier. Other than in respect of
the Company’s obligations under its executive and employee share
schemes, the Directors have no present intention of issuing any of the
authorised but unissued share capital of the Company.
Resolution 8. Your Directors also require additional authority from
shareholders to allot shares or grant rights over shares where they
propose to do so for cash and otherwise than to existing shareholders
pro rata to their holdings.  The authority granted at the last Annual

General Meeting is due to expire at this year’s Annual General Meeting.
Accordingly, Resolution 8 will be proposed as a special resolution to grant
such authority.  Apart from rights issues, the authority will be limited to the
issue of shares up to an aggregate nominal value of £263,375 (being 5 per
cent of the issued ordinary share capital of the Company as at 30 June
2002).  If given, this authority will expire on 5 February 2004 or at the
conclusion of the Annual General Meeting in 2003, whichever is the earlier.
Resolution 9.  This resolution will renew the authority of the Company to
purchase its own shares in the market up to a limit of 10 per cent of its
issued ordinary share capital.  The maximum and minimum prices are
stated in the resolution.  Your Directors believe that it is advantageous for
the Company to continue to have this flexibility to purchase its own
shares.  However, your Directors will only exercise this authority if they
were satisfied that a purchase would result in an increase in expected
earnings per share and would be in the interests of shareholders generally.
Directors’ responsibilities for the financial statements
Company law requires the Directors to prepare financial statements for
each financial year which give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of
the Company and the Group and of the profit or loss for that period.  
In preparing those financial statements, the Directors are required to:
–select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently;
– make judgements and estimates that are reasonable and prudent;
– state whether applicable accounting standards have been followed,
subject to any material departures disclosed and explained in the
financial statements;
–prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis unless it
is inappropriate to presume that the Company and Group will
continue in business.
The Directors are responsible for maintaining proper accounting records
which disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial
position of the Company and the Group and to enable them to ensure
that the financial statements comply with the Companies Act 1985.
They have general responsibility for taking such steps as are reasonably
open to them to safeguard the assets of the Company and the Group
and to prevent and detect fraud and other irregularities.

Corporate Governance
Compliance
The Board is committed to high standards of corporate governance
throughout the Group's operations and seeks to ensure that appropriate
procedures are in place and kept under regular review.
During the period up to the date of this report on 4 September 2002, the
Company has applied the principles set out in the Combined Code on
corporate governance and, subject to the exceptions explained below, has
complied throughout the year with each of the provisions set out in Section 1
of the Combined Code.  The areas of non compliance are:
– Christopher Thompson is regarded as being the Senior Independent
Director although he has not been identified formally as such by the Board.
– The Board accepts that the three non-executive Directors who acted
throughout the financial year may not have satisfied all the criteria which
are generally accepted as indicating independence.  In particular, they all
have had a long term association with the Company, having been non-
executive Directors for more than 15 years; however, Charles Fitzherbert
resigned on 30 June 2002, following the appointment on 25 April 2002
of George Kennedy who, from 1 July 2002, sits on both the
Remuneration and Audit Committees.  Also Colin Clive is a Director of a
company that has a notifiable holding in Isotron plc.
– In their contracts, the non-executive Directors are not appointed for a
specific period of office.
– The entire Board acts as the Nominations Committee and is responsible
for the selection and approval of candidates for appointments to the
Board.  Whilst this does not comply with Code provisions A.5.1 the
Directors consider this to be appropriate for the small size of the Board.
The Board
The Board is responsible for formulating strategy, monitoring financial
performance, acquisitions and disposals and approving capital expenditure.
The Board meets at least eight times a year and all Board members have
access to the advice and services of the Company Secretary and
independent professional advice, if required, at the Company’s expense.
Any new Directors are given the choice of appropriate external or internal
training.  A schedule of matters specifically reserved for the Board has
been adopted.  The Board is provided with appropriate and timely
information relating to matters for discussion at meetings and seeks
further information as necessary.  Both the Remuneration and the Audit
Committees comprise the three non-executive Directors. All Directors are
subject to election by shareholders at the first opportunity after their
appointment, and to re-election thereafter at intervals of no more than
three years. However, any Director over the age of 70 retires each year
and reappointment requires special notice.
Audit Committee
The Audit Committee, chaired by Christopher Thompson, is formally
constituted with written terms of reference and meets as required.  The
Committee is responsible for reviewing the interim and annual financial
statements, reviewing preliminary announcements and the effectiveness of
the system of internal controls, and for ensuring that any matters raised by
the auditors are given proper consideration.  The external auditors attend all
the meetings.  The Committee is also responsible for keeping under review
the scope and results of the external audit and its cost effectiveness and the
independence and objectivity of the external auditors.  The Committee
receives and reviews reports from the Risk Management Committee,
chaired by the Chief Executive, before submission to the Board.  At each
meeting, any executive Directors attending by invitation are asked to leave
so as to allow the external auditors to raise any audit issues relating to the
executive Directors with the Committee. 
Relations with Shareholders
The Annual General Meeting provides an opportunity for shareholders,
particularly private investors, to question the Board.  At the 2001 AGM, the
Chairmen of the Audit Committee and the Remuneration Committee were
available to answer questions.  The results of proxy votes were declared at
the 2001 AGM after each resolution had been dealt with on a show of
hands and this practice will be continued at future General Meetings.  Isotron plc annual report and accounts 2002 26.0
There is regular dialogue with individual institutional shareholders and general
presentations are made following the announcement of the Group's interim
and final results and at other times at the investors' request.
All major announcements issued through the Stock Exchange
Announcements Office are now made available as soon as possible on the
Company's website (www.isotron.co.uk) and, where significant, are also
mailed to each shareholder.
Internal control
The Board has applied the internal control provisions of the Combined Code
by establishing a continuous process for identifying, evaluating and
managing the significant risks faced by the Group.  The Board regularly
reviews the process, which has been in place from the start of the year to
the date of approval of this report and which is in accordance with Internal
Control: Guidance for Directors on the Combined Code published in
September 1999. The Board is responsible for the Group’s system of
internal control and for reviewing its effectiveness.  Such a system is
designed to manage rather than eliminate the risk of failure to achieve
business objectives, and can only provide reasonable and not absolute
assurance against material misstatement or loss.
In compliance with the Combined Code, the Board continuously reviews the
effectiveness of the Group’s system of internal control.   The Board’s
monitoring covers all controls, including financial, operational and compliance
controls and risk management.  It is based principally on reviewing reports
from management to consider whether significant weaknesses are promptly
remedied and indicate a need for more extensive monitoring.
The key elements of the internal control system are described below:
– there is a formal schedule of matters specifically reserved for the
Board's  decision with appropriate delegation of authority throughout
the management structure;
– the executive Directors are closely involved in the day to day operations
of the Company.  There are clearly defined lines of management
responsibilities at all levels up to and including the Group Board, and
the Group's accounting and reporting functions reflect this organisation
structure;
– the annual financial budget is approved by the Board;
– monthly management accounts are prepared and monitored against
budget and prior year performance;
– forecasts are prepared each quarter to reflect performance to date and
expectations for the remainder of the financial year;
– the Board reviews matters relating to internal control through the Audit
Committee which also receives reports from the Risk Management
Committee; 
– the Audit Committee reviews reports from the external auditors and
approves published financial information;
– an internal audit function has been established. Following the
Gammaster acquisition there has been a high level review of internal
controls at all new locations.  Audit investigation and monitoring is
undertaken by the Group Accountant and Finance Director.
Steps have been taken to further embed the principles of internal control
and risk management into the operations of the business and to address
areas of improvement which have been brought to the attention of
management and the Board.
Going Concern
The Directors consider that the Company and the Group have adequate
resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future, and
that it is therefore appropriate to adopt the going concern basis in preparing
financial statements.  In forming this view the Directors have reviewed the
Group's budget for 2002/03 and outline projections for the subsequent two
years, including capital expenditure plans and cashflow forecasts.  The
Directors consider that the Group is in a satisfactory financial position and
has sufficient borrowing facilities to meet its foreseeable cash requirements.

During the year the Remuneration Committee consisted solely of the
three non-executive Directors, namely Colin Clive (Chairman), Christopher
Thompson and Charles Fitzherbert.  Charles Fitzherbert resigned as a
Director on 30 June 2002 and from 1 July 2002 his place on the
Committee has been taken by George Kennedy.
Compliance
The Remuneration Committee considers that throughout the year under
review and to the date of this report on 4 September 2002 the Company
has complied with the provisions set out in Section 1 of the Combined
Code and Schedules A and B thereto.  The areas of non compliance are
as shown on page 25.
Remuneration policy
The Committee is responsible for recommending the remuneration
levels of Directors to the full Board and for supervising the grant of
stock options and other benefits in kind.  In making its
recommendations the Committee has access to professional advice
and takes into account the performance of the individual and their
experience, as well as market information on rates of salary for similar
positions in comparable listed companies.
The emoluments of the Directors for the year ended 30 June 2002 
were as set out at the base of this page.
Benefits in kind, both taxable and other, comprise mainly car, fuel, and private
health costs.  From 1 July 2001, the Company continued to operate the
annual bonus scheme for executive Directors whereby a sliding scale bonus of
up to 40% of basic salary was payable depending on profit performance.  No
payments were made under this scheme during the year.  However, in
recognition of the successful completion of the Gammaster acquisition in
January 2002 and in substitution of the existing scheme, the Remuneration
Committee rewarded the executive Directors (excluding Paul Santing) with
bonuses of either 20% or 40% of basic annual salaries.  
Paul Santing received a bonus of 7% of basic annual salary in respect of 
the period from appointment to the Board to 30 June 2002.
The Company introduced a non-contributory defined contribution pension
scheme on 1 April 1997.  In relation to the executive Directors the Company
contributes 10% of salary plus in the UK an age-related contribution of between
0% and 3% to the scheme.  Performance related bonuses and benefits in kind
are not pensionable.  The pension scheme operated in the UK replaced the
previous defined benefit arrangement which was wound-up during 2001.

Paul Santing was a member of the OPG defined benefit pension scheme.  Under transitional arrangements, payments continue to be made to the scheme whilst Isotron evaluates
alternatives for the future.  Pension benefits accrued for Paul Santing during the year excluding any increase for inflation amounts to £1k.  The transfer value of the increase, including ancillary
benefits, has been calculated on the basis of actuarial advice in accordance with Actuarial Guidance Note GN11.  At the end of the period this evaluation amounts to £3k and is reduced by
the members’ own contributions during the period.  The accumulated total accrued at 30 June 2002, assuming normal retirement period, amounts to £7k. Isotron plc annual report and accounts 2002 28.0
Remuneration Report continued
The Company operates an Executive Share Option Scheme for
executives which was approved by shareholders on 9 November
1994.  Options issued under this scheme may be exercised between
three and ten years after the date granted, but only if certain
performance criteria are satisfied.  The performance conditions require
that options may only be exercised if the Company has achieved
growth in earnings per share in excess of the increase in the retail price
index over any three year period preceding exercise.  Options are
granted either under the approved 1994 Executive Share Option
Scheme up to the individual limits originally approved by the
shareholders and incorporated in the scheme rules or under the
unapproved appendix to the scheme.  Options granted under the
unapproved appendix may also be exercised between three and ten
years after the date of grant and are also subject to the achievement of
agreed performance conditions.  The share option scheme is designed
to allow Directors to participate in the performance of the Company
and to encourage them to develop the business for the benefit of
shareholders.  As at 30 June 2002 the Directors’ interests in options to
acquire 25p ordinary shares under the Executive Share Option
Schemes (ESO) and the Savings Related Share Option Schemes
(SAYE) were as shown on the table opposite.
Outside appointments
The Board has not precluded the possibility of executive Directors
accepting appointments and payments from sources outside the
Company.  No such positions are currently held and any proposal
would be considered by the Board on its merits.
Service contracts
No Director has a service contract requiring a notice period from the
Company of more than one year.  The Committee’s policy on early
termination is to provide compensation which reflects the Company’s
contracted obligations, whilst recognising the principle of mitigation of
damages.
Non-executive Directors
The remuneration of non-executive Directors is determined by the full
Board within the limits set out in the Company’s Articles of Association.
The non-executive Directors do not participate in the bonus scheme,
executive share option scheme or pension scheme operated by the
Company, nor do they receive benefits in kind.
The non-executive Directors are employed by businesses which
charge fees for their services.  During the year ended 30 June 2002, a
total of £40,198 (2001: £35,387) was paid to a company of which
both Colin Clive and Charles Fitzherbert are Directors and
shareholders; £15,940 (2001: £13,979) was also paid to a business
which is owned and operated by Christopher Thompson.  Fees
payable to George Kennedy since his appointment in April 2002
amounted to £2,720.

Report of the Independent Auditors to the Members of Isotron plc
We have audited the financial statements on pages 31 to 55. 
Respective responsibilities of Directors and Auditors
The Directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report.  As
described on page 24, this includes responsibility for preparing the
financial statements in accordance with applicable United Kingdom law
and accounting standards.  Our responsibilities, as independent
auditors, are established in the United Kingdom by statute, the Auditing
Practices Board, the Listing Rules of the Financial Services Authority,
and by our profession’s ethical guidance.
We report to you our opinion as to whether the financial statements
give a true and fair view and are properly prepared in accordance
with the Companies Act 1985.  We also report to you if, in our
opinion, the Directors’ report is not consistent with the financial
statements, if the Company has not kept proper accounting
records, if we have not received all the information and explanations
we require for our audit, or if information specified by law or the
Listing Rules regarding Directors’ remuneration and transactions
with the Group is not disclosed.
We review whether the statements on pages 25 to 26 reflect the
Company’s compliance with the seven provisions of the Combined
Code specified for our review by the Listing Rules, and we report if it
does not.  We are not required to consider whether the Board’s
statements on internal control cover all risks and controls, or form an
opinion on the effectiveness of the Group’s corporate governance
procedures or its risk and control procedures.
We read the other information contained in the Annual Report,
including the corporate governance statement, and consider whether it
is consistent with the audited financial statements.  We consider the
implications for our report if we become aware of any apparent
misstatements or material inconsistencies with the financial statements.
Basis of audit opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with Auditing Standards issued
by the Auditing Practices Board.  An audit includes examination, on a
test basis, of evidence relevant to the amounts and disclosures in the
financial statements.  It also includes an assessment of the significant
estimates and judgements made by the Directors in the preparation of
the financial statements, and of whether the accounting policies are
appropriate to the Group’s circumstances, consistently applied and
adequately disclosed.
We planned and performed our audit so as to obtain all the information
and explanations which we considered necessary in order to provide
us with sufficient evidence to give reasonable assurance that the
financial statements are free from material misstatement, whether
caused by fraud or other irregularity or error.  In forming our opinion we
also evaluated the overall adequacy of the presentation of information
in the financial statements.
Opinion
In our opinion the financial statements give a true and fair view of the
state of affairs of the Company and the Group as at 30 June 2002 and
of the profit of the Group for the year then ended and have been
properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 1985.

Notes to the Financial Statements
1  Principal accounting policies
The following accounting policies have been applied consistently in
dealing with items which are considered material in relation to the
accounts except as noted below under “New Accounting Standards”.
Basis of accounting
The accounts have been prepared under the historical cost convention
and in accordance with applicable accounting standards.
Basis of consolidation
The Group’s financial statements consolidate the accounts of the
Company and its subsidiary undertakings made up to 30 June 2002.
Unless otherwise stated, the acquisition method of accounting has
been adopted. Under this method, the results of subsidiary
undertakings acquired or disposed of in the year are included in the
consolidated profit and loss account from the date of acquisition or up
to the date of disposal.  In the Company’s accounts, investments in
subsidiary undertakings are stated at cost less amounts written off for
any permanent diminution in value of investments.
Under section 230(4) of the Companies Act 1985 the Company is
exempt from the requirement to present its own profit and loss account.
The Company’s profit for the financial year is disclosed in note 21.
New Accounting Standards
The Company has adopted the new Financial Reporting Standards FRS 19
“Deferred Tax”.  The impact of this adoption has resulted in an adjustment
of £1,938K in the prior period and the accounts have been restated
accordingly.
Depreciation
Freehold land is not depreciated.  Depreciation is calculated so as to
write off the cost, less residual value of other tangible fixed assets, over
their estimated useful lives from the point at which they are brought into
use.  The following rates have been used:
Freehold buildings 50 years straight line
Major plant items 20 years straight line
Plant and machinery 5-10 years straight line
Fixtures and fittings 3-10 years straight line
Motor vehicles 4 years straight line
Cobalt 15 years principally on a reducing balance basis 
Stocks
Stocks consist mainly of consumables.  These are stated at the lower 
of cost and net realisable value.  Cost is determined on a first in, first 
out basis.
1 37.0 accounts 2002
Deferred taxation
Except where otherwise required by accounting standards full provision,
without discount, is made for all timing differences between the treatment
of certain items for taxation and accounting purposes which have arisen
but not reversed by the balance sheet date, except as otherwise required
by FRS19.
Foreign exchange
Transactions denominated in foreign currencies are translated into sterling
and recorded at the rate of exchange ruling at the date of the transaction.
Balances in foreign currencies are stated in sterling at the rates of
exchange ruling at 30 June.  Any exchange differences arising during the
year are written off to the profit and loss account in the period.
Differences arising on the translation of opening net assets in overseas
companies are dealt with through reserves, whilst the profit or loss for the
year is translated at the average rate of exchange.
Pensions
The Group operates a number of defined contribution schemes for all
eligible employees.  Contributions are charged to the profit and loss
account in the period to which they relate.  The charge for the period in
respect of defined contribution schemes was £343k.  In addition the Group
operates a pension scheme providing benefits based on final pensionable
pay for all Dutch employees.  The assets of this scheme are held separately
from those of the Group.  Pension scheme assets are measured using
market values.  Pension scheme liabilities are measured using a project unit
method and are discounted at the rate of return on a high quality corporate
bond of equivalent term and currency to the liability.
The pension scheme surplus (to the extent that it is considered
recoverable) or deficit is recognised in full and presented on the face of
the balance sheet.  The movement in the scheme surplus/deficit is split
between operating charges, interest and, in the statement of total
recognised gains and losses, actuarial gains and losses.
Government grants
Capital based government grants, net of the costs of obtaining them, are
included within accruals and deferred income in the balance sheet and
credited to trading profit over the estimated useful lives of the assets to
which they relate.
Leases 
Leases are accounted for as “operating leases” and the rental charges
are charged to the profit and loss account on a straight line basis over
the life of the lease.
Goodwill
Purchased goodwill (both positive and negative) arising on
consolidation in respect of acquisitions before 1 July 1998, when FRS
10 “Goodwill and intangible assets” was adopted, was written off to
reserves in the year of acquisition.  When a subsequent disposal
occurs any related goodwill previously written off to reserves is written
back through the profit and loss account as part of the profit or loss 
on disposal.
Any purchased goodwill (representing the excess of the fair value of 
the consideration given and associated costs over the fair value of the
separable net assets acquired) arising on consolidation in respect of
acquisitions since 1 July 1998 has been capitalised.  Positive goodwill
is amortised to nil by equal annual instalments over its estimated useful
life, normally 20 years.
On the subsequent disposal or termination of a business acquired
since 1 July 1998, the profit or loss on disposal or termination is
calculated after charging (crediting) the unamortised amount of any
related goodwill (negative goodwill).
In the Company’s financial statements, investments in subsidiary
undertakings are stated at cost. Isotron plc annual report and accounts 2002 38.0

Acquisition of Gammaster
On 16 January 2002 Isotron acquired the entire issued share capital of
the following companies:
Gammaster BV 
Gammaster Radvice BV [Dormant] 
Gammaster Ireland Ltd
Gammaster South Africa (Pty) Ltd
Gammaster International BV [Dormant] 
Gammaster Provence S.A.
Gammaster Sweden AB
Nordisk Sterilisering AB [Dormant] 
In addition on the same date Isotron acquired 62.5% of the issued share
capital of Gammaster Deutschland GmbH and 92% of the issued share
capital of Gammaster (Thailand) Ltd.
The consideration of £37.7 million was satisfied by a cash payment of
£34.4 million plus costs of acquisition of £3.3 million.  An amount of 
£8  million of the consideration was used to settle outstanding payable
balances with OPG (seller) and third parties.  The resulting provisional
goodwill of £19.9 million will be amortised over twenty years (see 
note 12).  At the date of acquisition, the combined net assets of the
acquired entities were £9.8 million after recognising policy alignments
due to different policies adopted by the Gammaster group to those
adopted by Isotron.

24 25  Financial instruments
53.0 accounts 2002
(a)  Overview
Treasury activities are managed by the Finance Director and are
subject to policies and procedures approved by the Board.  The
Group’s major financial risks relate to movement in the Euro
exchange rate and in UK and Euro bank base rates.  No
speculative use of financial instruments is permitted.
Surplus cash is generally held in the form of UK and Euro currency
and is invested in the local money market, for periods of no longer
than three months.  The Group’s policies require that deposits are
spread across a range of different banks to mitigate risks and that
all cash deposits are held or transacted through high credit-rated
financial institutions.
(b) Financial assets
The Group’s financial assets, excluding short term debtors, consist
mainly of Sterling and Euro denominated cash deposits, which earn
interest at money market rates (of up to three months maturity) linked
to the UK and European bank base rate.  The fair value of the
Group’s financial assets are equivalent to the value at which they are
carried in the financial statements.
(c) Financial liabilities
The interest rate profile of the Group’s financial liabilities as at 30 June 2002 
is detailed below.  Floating rate financial liabilities, which comprise of Sterling,
Euro, Malaysian Ringgit and South African Rand bear interest related to the
local bank base rates.  The fair value of the Group’s financial liabilities are
equivalent to the value at which they are carried in the financial statements.
(d) Interest rate risk
The Group is subject to fluctuation in interest rates on its loans and surplus
cash deposits.  In December 2001 the Board, in applying a risk management
strategy, authorised taking out interest rate hedging arrangements on 50% of
loans denominated in Sterling and 50% of loans denominated in Euro effective
from 16 July 2002 and terminating on 17 January 2005.  Amounts to be paid
or received under these agreements will be recognised in the interest expenses
consistent with the terms of the agreements.
(e) Currency exposure
The Group’s principal exchange risk lies in the translation of the net investment
in overseas subsidiaries and of their monetary assets and liabilities.  These risks
relate primarily to Euro exchange rates and these are kept under constant
review.  The Group has mitigated the risks by borrowing in Euro.

27  Pensions
The Group operates a number of defined contribution pension schemes
for all eligible employees.  Group contributions are charged to the profit
and loss account in the period in which they relate.  In addition, the
Group operates a pension scheme providing benefits based on final
pensionable pay for all Dutch employees.  A full actuarial evaluation of
the defined benefit scheme was carried out at 16 January 2002 and
updated to 30 June 2002 by a qualified independent actuary.  The main
assumptions used by the actuary were as follows:
– Rate of increase in salaries 2.75%-4% pa
– Rate of increase in pension payments in line with price inflation

The assumptions used by the actuary are the best estimates chosen from
a range of possible actuarial assumptions which may not necessarily be
borne out in practice.  
The full actuarial valuation at 16 January 2002 showed a deficit in the
scheme of £181k, which was updated to £233k at 30 June 2002. 55.0 accounts 2002

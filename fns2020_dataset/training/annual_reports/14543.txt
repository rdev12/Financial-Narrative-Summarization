Specialist Care Chairman’s Statement
Introduction
It is with great pleasure that I welcome all new Southern Cross
Healthcare (“Southern Cross”) shareholders following the Initial
Public Offering (“IPO”) of shares earlier this year. The last 
12 months have seen the Company grow significantly to a position
where it is now the UK’s leading provider of care home services 
for the elderly and also a major provider of specialist services for
people with physical and/or learning-disabilities.
As the market leader, and primary consolidator in the UK care 
home services sector, Southern Cross has benefited from the
growing demand for high-quality, value-for-money, long-term care
services across the UK. The success of our strategy of acquiring 
and developing modern, purpose-built care homes in areas of high
demand is reflected in the financial results for the 52 weeks to 
1 October 2006.
Results and Dividends 
Turnover for the 52 weeks ended 1 October 2006 increased by 
75%, on an annualised basis, to £610.9m, primarily as a result of
the acquisition of Ashbourne Healthcare completed in November
2005. Average fees per occupied bed also increased during the year
by 8.0% and a number of individual new homes were acquired and
developed from the Company’s pipeline of growth opportunities.
Adjusted earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, exceptional
charges and charges for future minimum rental increases (“Adjusted
EBITDA”) was £48.8m representing an increase of 67.1% compared
to the prior year on an annualised basis. The loss before taxation
was £17.4m, reflecting the impact of the IFRS adjustment for
charges for future minimum rental increases of £30.7m, exceptional
charges relating to the IPO which amounted to £3.1m, and the
financing costs of the capital structure pre-IPO.
Basic loss per ordinary share was 9.4p after a UK Corporation 
tax credit of £5.3m. Adjusted earnings per share before charges 
for future minimum rental increases and exceptional charges and
the taxation impact thereof were 10.0p.
Had the Company been listed for the whole of the 52 weeks ended
1 October 2006, the Board considers that it would have recommended
a dividend of 4.8p per ordinary share. Taking into account the 
82 days for which the Company was listed prior to the financial year
end, the Board is recommending a pro rata dividend of 1.1p per
ordinary share. Going forward the Company expects to grow
dividends from this level to reflect the growth prospects and cashflow
generation of the business, while maintaining an appropriate level
of dividend cover.
4 Southern Cross Healthcare Group PLC   Annual Report and Accounts 2006
It is with great pleasure that I welcome all new
Southern Cross Healthcare shareholders following
the Initial Public Offering of shares earlier this year.
William Colvin Chairman Management and Staff
The Board, on behalf of all shareholders, would like to thank all 
the dedicated staff working in our homes and also those supporting
the homes, as well as the management team who oversee the
entire national operation. Their hard work and commitment have
enabled us to build Southern Cross to become market leader 
in the sector.
Outlook
Care home services are playing an increasingly important role in
the overall healthcare provision across the UK. The combination 
of an ageing population and the reduction in overall bed numbers
within the NHS and the long-term care sector have resulted in the
growing demand for quality care services.
Looking ahead to the next 12 months, we believe Southern Cross is 
well placed to achieve further progress in both revenue growth and
profitability. We have secured £300m of landlord funds to enable 
us to continue our acquisition plans and we have a significantly
expanded development pipeline which will add a further 1,000 beds
to our portfolio by December 2007. At the same time, we shall
continue our drive for growth in fee and occupancy rates, as well 
as maintaining tight cost control.
The Board remains confident that there will be a growing demand
for our services and remains firmly committed to ensuring that all
our homes provide the best possible levels of care for all of our
valued clients.
William Colvin
Chairman
Southern Cross Healthcare Group PLC   Annual Report and Accounts 2006 5 Chief Executive’s Statement
Strategy Overview
I am delighted to confirm another excellent year for the Southern
Cross Group. 
During a year in which we have successfully listed the Company’s
shares on the London Stock Exchange, we have continued to grow
our market presence, by adding volume to both of our principal
business streams and expanding our development pipeline. Our
funding strategy and business model ensures that we can continue
to increase shareholder returns without recourse to additional
shareholder equity, as the last 12 months’ activity has demonstrated.
Strategically, the Group remains committed to the long-term care
market, targeting further growth in both core and specialist divisions.
The demand for long-term care services is anticipated to increase
substantially over the next 25 years. On the basis that the
percentage of elderly people currently living in residential 
care homes in each of the age groups 65 years to 74 years, 
75 years to 84 years and over 85 remains unchanged, then the
application of those percentages to forecast census figures from
2006 to 2031 suggests a need for an average of 14,000 new beds
per annum just to satisfy emerging demand. 
Given the ongoing contraction of supply in the marketplace – as 
a consequence of small providers selling their properties to realise
the land value which is often greater than the care home business
value, occupancy levels over the next few years are likely to reach
capacity in excess of the current level of 91%, a figure which
includes a portfolio of immature development homes.
We believe that the typical dependency levels of persons living 
in care homes today are such that 24-hour care is required to 
meet the range of social and nursing care needs presented. 
Whilst supportive of Government’s strategy of ensuring elderly
people have options for home care if possible, we remain
convinced that with a reducing pool of taxpayers due to an ageing
population, the residential care model continues to offer “best
economic value” for 24-hour care services. At current average
weekly fee rates, of £465 for Elderly Care this equates to a price 
of just over £2.75 per hour.
We will therefore continue to pursue our strategy of increasing
capacity via acquisition and organic growth programmes in
anticipation of the growing demand for our services. 
As the UK’s largest provider, we still have only a 6% share of a 
£12 billion revenue market, and consequently have resourced our
development and acquisition teams to ensure that we continue 
to add capacity and increase our market penetration over the next
five years.
Group Branding
With two business streams (elderly care and specialist services), 
we have redefined our marketing strategy this year to create an
additional brand, targeted specifically at clients who are funding
their own placement. Rather like the hotel sector, we now offer –
via our Ashbourne Senior Living brand – facilities with higher
accommodation standards and those additional services often
requested by self-funding residents.
6 Southern Cross Healthcare Group PLC   Annual Report and Accounts 2006
During another excellent year, we have continued
to consolidate the long-term care sector to become
the UK market leader, as well as successfully listing
our business on the London Stock Exchange.
Philip Scott Chief Executive The Southern Cross brand will continue to predominantly cater for
residents who are funded by local authorities. Those placements
are generally procured on an agreed service specification linked 
to client dependency and price. Active Care Partnerships is our
specialist services brand providing younger people with as much
support as required to maximise their ability to lead active and
independent lives. 
Acquisition Activity
During the year we acquired the Ashbourne Group adding a further
193 leasehold care homes and over 10,000 beds to group capacity.
Integration of that portfolio is now complete and I am pleased to
report that occupancy has increased in that portfolio by 2% since
acquisition in November 2005.
In addition to the Ashbourne purchase, we added a total of 950
beds via small bolt on transactions.
This includes, post-flotation, the “United A” portfolio that added 
270 beds to the Group. All beds, except for the “United A” portfolio,
were funded utilising landlord facilities in line with our current
funding strategy. We will shortly exchange contracts for the on-sale
of the “United A” freeholds to one of our landlord funds.
Development Pipeline
Our development pipeline has expanded significantly and we
currently have in excess of 2,000 beds in various stages of planning
and construction. A further 1,000 beds will be delivered and open
for business by the end of December 2007. Particular areas of focus
continue to be Northern Ireland (NI) and Scotland (SC) where
demographic pressure is increasing demand for elderly care services.
During the year we have opened a 64-bedded facility in Enniskillen
(NI), 90 beds in Wishaw and 85 beds in Renfrew (both SC). We
have also added an 80-bedded unit in York and a further 66 beds
by way of extensions to existing facilities.
In addition we have added two specialist units in Scotland under
the Active Care Partnerships brand. 
Disposal Programme
The Group continues to review the long-term sustainability of
particular homes acquired as part of material acquisitions. In the
last 12 months we have assigned the leasehold interest for three
homes that did not meet our trading performance expectations and
were unlikely to do so in the long term. As part of the Ashbourne
acquisition, we acquired a number of unencumbered freeholds. 
Two of these have been sold and a further five will be marketed
for sale given the age and limitations of the properties. We are
likely to achieve a small profit on the disposal of these businesses.
Sale and Leaseback Financing
The Group has funded its growth using sale and leaseback financing
since incorporation in 1996. That funding mechanism remains at
the core of our financing strategy and I am delighted to report that
we have secured £300m of landlord funds available for a two-year
period at a fixed initial yield, to enable us to continue our
acquisition plan unabated. These funds give us real visibility over
forward rents and over the last year we have as a consequence of
our covenant strength, continued to access new funding sources
with relatively low yield expectations.

Market Outlook 
With the anticipated demographic pressures compounded by the
continued contraction in supply and the ongoing burden of legislation
(such as the Care Standards Act and National Minimum Wage)
pushing up operating costs, we expect that fee rates will continue to
rise in excess of inflation. That is essential to reduce the number of
beds leaving the market, to encourage new development to meet
the anticipated emerging demand and to provide full cost recovery 
in respect of increased legislation. 
Given the quality of our modern, well-invested, purpose-built portfolio
and the fact that we are now compliant with most of the legislative
requirements that required material capital expenditure, we expect
our operating costs to remain relatively stable. Home payroll costs
account for the largest proportion of our operating cost base. However,
we have a recognition agreement with the GMB union and 
therefore continue to have real visibility over likely cost increases, 
as negotiation and agreement of pay awards precede fee reviews. 
In addition, we continue to recruit personnel directly from overseas
and as a consequence our reliance on agency personnel has
continued to reduce during the year.
Acquisition and development opportunities continue to present
themselves and we expect to participate in the ongoing
consolidation of the sector. We are on course to exceed our annual
target of adding 1,200 beds in 2007 and therefore our efforts are
now focused on adding to the 2008 development pipeline.

Business Review
The Group’s core interest remains the provision of care services for
elderly people, complemented by a small but expanding specialist
care business. Over the last 12 months both business streams have
increased capacity as acquisition and development activity has
progressed.
Our Elderly Care business has recently been branded under two
service offerings; Southern Cross Healthcare and Ashbourne Senior
Living. The specialist business is branded under the Active Care
Partnerships identity and trades under a separate divisional
operational team. 
Southern Cross Healthcare 
The largest of the branded portfolios with 466 homes and 24,027
beds, Southern Cross provides services for clients predominantly
funded by local authority payers. The facilities are in modern
purpose built homes, with the majority of beds being in single
ensuite rooms.
The Southern Cross branded homes are located throughout the
United Kingdom, albeit with greater penetration in Scotland, and
the North of England. The average home size is 55 beds and
typically of a two storey construction. 
Over the last year we have sustained good levels of occupancy
whilst experiencing the usual seasonality, that being a marginal
increase in occupancy post-April of each year as local authorities
enter a new budget year. That gain is in part offset by a slight
reduction in occupancy over winter months as mortality rates
increase and commissioners of service have extended periods 
of vacation, thus slowing referrals.
Homes operating under the Southern Cross brand seek to cater
predominantly for high dependency residents with specific nursing
or social care needs. Average length of stay for this client group 
is 11 months. 
Average occupancy levels of 93% in our mature homes are in line
with last year’s performance. Group average occupancy remains
stable at 91%.
Quality service provision remains our key focus,
whilst progressing our branded service offerings 
to our clients.
John Murphy Group Operations Director
Elderly Care Business Review
10 Southern Cross Healthcare Group PLC   Annual Report and Accounts 2006
Ashbourne Senior Living
Currently 72 homes with 3,974 beds have been rebranded under
the Ashbourne Senior Living brand. Recognising that a number of
our clients self fund their care placement and often want additional
services and perhaps a higher standard of accommodation, homes
operating under this brand will in time be able to meet the
demand for such.
Presently, any client (except in Scotland) with a net worth in 
excess of £21,000 has to fully fund his or her own care placement.
Given the push towards home ownership in the 1970s and 1980s
combined with such a low qualifying threshold and an increasing
demand for long-term care services, this will inevitably lead to
more and more clients having to fund their own care. On that basis,
rather like the hotel sector, service users will price differentiate 
on the basis of accommodation and service standards.
Occupancy performance is in line with Group average of 91% and
average fee rates are some 15% higher than those paid by local
authorities. Southern Cross Healthcare Group PLC   Annual Report and Accounts 2006 11
Active Care Partnerships
With 42 homes and 916 beds Active Care Partnerships provides
social and healthcare support services for clients with a range 
of learning disabilities. All homes, whilst registered with the
Commission for Social Care Inspection, tend to be much smaller
than those homes within Elderly Care portfolios and discreetly
located within residential communities. The care model is much
more socially focused with an emphasis on promoting and
developing a range of skills to live as independently as possible.
Over the last year we have added two developments to the Active
portfolio, Moorpark Place and the Green Door Clinic, both located 
in Scotland. These two units are modern, purpose built in design,
providing the much needed space required by the respective client
groups.
Average fees are £873 per week, reflecting the fact that pricing is
negotiated on a case by case basis after a careful assessment of
need and costing of resource package required to meet that need.  
Personnel
Manpower availability and recruitment to the care sector has
improved significantly over the last two years, given access to
European labour markets. We continue to maintain an active 
foreign recruitment programme and we currently employ in 
excess of 2,000 staff from Eastern Europe and South-East Asia.
Those personnel are deployed across the UK during an initial 
two-year contract period and generally a high number of those
staff re-sign for a second period. 
Our staff teams have worked diligently over the last year to 
ensure that our reputation as a provider of high-quality services 
is maintained. We continue to recognise that hard work and
commitment via our care awards initiative, which is designed to
reward staff members who have consistently provided a very high
level of service in their chosen profession. We are fortunate to have
many such staff and I would like to thank all of our employees for
their commitment to our resident group and loyalty to the Company. 
Within the operational management structure, we continue to
maintain a growth overhead, anticipating further acquisition and
development activity. That overhead ensures adequate planning 
is afforded to the integration of completed acquisitions, a process
that commences immediately after transaction completion. 
The integration process is a tried and tested model and a number 
of senior managers are allocated to effect the integration in the
shortest possible timeframe.
Specialist Care
We will continue to develop our Active Care brand, mainly through
organic development as commissioners continue to request modern,
purpose-built, fully-equipped units that promote independent living.
We make every effort to increase 
the comfort level of every resident,
assisting them with a variety of
essential activities and are constantly
looking at ways to improve their
experience with us. Business Review
12 Southern Cross Healthcare Group PLC   Annual Report and Accounts 2006
Service Standards
During the year we have again revised our policies and procedures
to ensure that “best practice guidelines” as issued by the sector
regulator and the Department of Health are fully implemented into
our day-to-day service delivery. We continue to robustly monitor 
our service on a weekly/monthly basis to ensure consistency in 
the quality of service provided. Results are collated centrally 
and circulated to Executive Directors for review and comment. 
A summary of those results is included within monthly Board
Papers for all Board Directors to consider. 
We have over the last 12 months appointed two new management
positions – a Regulation and Compliance Manager and a Group
Health and Safety Manager – to ensure we have the in house
expertise to provide constant audit and review. These new
managers provide Board Directors with data to support best
practice initiatives for both disciplines.  
Regulatory Environment
Given our national geographic presence, the Group’s services are
monitored by a number of regulatory bodies. Care homes in
England have up to three regulatory inspections a year, two of
which are usually unannounced. The Commission for Social Care
Inspection (CSCI) is the regulator and their teams of inspectors are
located throughout England. We now benefit from having a Provide
Relationship Manager, within CSCI, who acts as a central single
point of contact to discuss issues. We welcome this initiative 
and are working closely with the regulator to ensure consistent
interpretation of the care standards across all of our homes.
In Scotland the regulator is the Scottish Care Commission that
operates in a similar manner to its English counterpart. In Wales,
the agency is Care Standards Inspectorate Wales (CSIW) and in
Northern Ireland it is Registration and Inspection Units (RIUs). 
All of these regulatory agencies operate under the Care Standards
Act legislation and the associated Care Home Regulations. That
legislation gives the regulator very material powers including
enforcement action which may be implemented against rogue
providers.
The results of the regulatory inspections are public documents and
therefore act as a continual benchmark of our service.
As a result of these inspections and our own rigorous internal
compliance review procedures, we are confident that our services
continue to meet regulatory standards and that our policies and
procedures fully comply with care home regulations.
From April 2007 we are likely to see the regulators introduction 
of a star rating system akin to that of the hotel sector. We remain
hopeful that this initiative will in time lead to price differentiation
based on the quality of services provided. Should that be the case,
clearly those providers gaining a higher star award can expect to
achieve higher fee rates. Given the quality of our portfolio and high
standard of service provided we anticipate our homes being star
rated at the top end of the awards range.  
John Murphy
Group Operations Director
We have a wide range of vehicles 
and equipment which assist in the

Community
Southern Cross provides financial support to our Care Centres so
they can consolidate their position in the local community for the
benefit of service users, staff and the local community.
Each of our individual Care Centres has its own ideas for community
integration based on its knowledge of the local community. Our
service users and staff work together to raise funds from raffles,
fetes and coffee mornings all for good causes. This money has
gone to improve the lives of our service users and a variety of 
local causes championed by our Care Centres across the United
Kingdom. Our sponsorship of local primary school football teams
has been particularly successful. Our approach is designed to
encourage confidence building, competitiveness and healthy 
living amongst young children.
During 2006, our people supported a number of charities including
Alzheimer's Society, Children in Need, Macmillan Cancer Support,
Royal National Institute for the Blind, Multiple Sclerosis Society and
Action on Elder Abuse, which was the featured charity for Southern
Cross in 2006. Our people raised £16,770 from various local events
around the country. This was increased with a £50,000 donation
from Southern Cross.
Our community involvement is focused on local initiatives where
we can really make a difference to children and their schools and
where we can bring communities together across the generations.  
Workplace
Southern Cross is committed to the principle of equal opportunity
and opposes all forms of unfair or unlawful discrimination. We
intend to provide an environment that gives equality to all,
irrespective of race, gender, disability, religion or sexual orientation.
Southern Cross has formed a partnership with the Royal College 
of Nursing in a special project aimed at internationally-recruited
nurses. The objective of the project is to enhance the opportunities
and potential for development for such staff. Through local colleges
we have been able to help our staff develop their skills and to train
nurse mentors to pass these skills on to their colleagues.
At the end of October 2006 10.0% of our workforce were 
non-UK nationals and 82.5% of our workforce were female.
By understanding and valuing diversity, we are better placed to
meet the needs of our service users. Equal opportunities for all 
are embedded in all of our principles and practices.
Harassment, bullying or any form of intimidation of our employees,
clients, customers or suppliers is not acceptable at Southern Cross.
We are committed to providing a safe, secure and attractive
environment for both our service users and our staff.
Corporate, Social Responsibility
Our local focus helps us to deliver a quality service to our residents,
support our staff and interact with the local community.

care services, we are supportive of a
number of charities, including Action
on Elder Abuse. Business Review

Health and Safety
The Chief Executive has overall responsibility for the health, safety
and welfare of staff and service users. The Group Operations
Director has responsibility at Board-level, for the Statement of
Intent to implement the Health and Safety Policy.
The Senior Operations Team (SET), comprising the Group Operations
Director, Managing Directors and other departmental heads, meets
regularly and reviews the Health and Safety Strategy and Standards
for the Group as set by the Central Health and Safety Committee.
This group reviews the organisation’s health and safety performance
regularly, ensuring that effective monitoring and reporting
procedures are in place to meet all relevant legislation and
standards.
Environmental Issues
On a number of levels, we are working with our suppliers to
develop a “greener” approach to the way we run our business. To
that end, we have put in place a number of initiatives to decrease
our energy consumption. For example, we have installed smart
metering and on line energy reporting for the vast majority of our
Care Centres with a commitment to have all of our sites included
by December 2006. This system allows each site to be monitored
and adjusted where necessary in our efforts to establish an
efficient, structured energy management programme. In addition,
by the end of 2007 it is our plan to have one third of all of our
sites on “green energy”. As a matter of practice, when our Care
Centres require replacement lighting bulbs they are automatically.
sent low energy versions.
We have also made significant efforts to improve the amount 
of recycling that we undertake as a company. We comply with
regulations on the disposal of electrical and other materials. We 
are also making progress in how we dispose of our clinical waste,
managing the transition from reliance on landfill disposal to
incineration. We have recently appointed a national supplier for the
collection of our trade waste and establishing a programme for 
the responsible disposal and recycling of cardboard. The variety of
initiatives we have put in place reflects the scope of our business.
From recyclable products for our copiers and printers, to recycling
waste cooking oil from our kitchens, we believe in doing what we
can to protect the environment.
We will continue to make efforts to reduce the impact of the Group
on the environment and to integrate environmental issues into our
existing business practices.
Marketplace
Southern Cross is committed to providing a quality service to our
service users and their families. We are committed to extending the
level of accessibility to our services and communications regardless
of an individual’s physical characteristics.
Our service users’ needs are central to the services we provide. 
We actively look for their feedback and conduct regular surveys 
to ensure we incorporate their views when defining our service.
Our suppliers are regarded as partners. Without our partners, we
would be unable to provide the quality of service that we do. They
are a vital part of our service delivery.
We know that the best care comes
from a continuous commitment to
training and creating a motivated and
knowledgeable team. Understanding
and valuing diversity within our
people puts us in a much better
position to understand the needs

We are committed to recruiting, retaining and motivating suitably
qualified employees at all levels within the Group to ensure we

Their colleagues, service users and service users’ families nominate
individuals for awards.

16 Southern Cross Healthcare Group PLC   Annual Report and Accounts 2006
Overview
Acquisition and Development Activity
This has been another year of significant growth and development
for the Group. November 2005 saw the acquisition of the Ashbourne
portfolio, increasing the size of the Group by 193 homes and over
10,000 beds. Outside of that major acquisition, the Group has
continued to grow through its development programme (428 new
beds opened) and through bolt-on acquisitions (950 new beds via
eight transactions). It is the Group’s intention to continue with this
two-pronged strategy and the completion of dedicated landlord
funds totalling £300.0m will enable us to facilitate this growth.
Initial Public Offering (“IPO”)
On 12 July 2006, the shares of the Company were admitted to the
Official List of the London Stock Exchange. The primary share offer
raised £175.0m which was used to refinance debt, redeeming
shareholder deep discounted bonds and loan notes and reducing
bank indebtedness. Approximately £20.0m of the proceeds were
used to meet the costs of flotation.
In September 2006, the Company entered the FTSE 250 list. The
IPO has strengthened our financial position, simplified our capital
structure and given the Group a solid base to further consolidate
the UK care home sector.
Integration and Restructuring
During the year we have completed the integration of the
operations and back-office support systems of Highfield (acquired
in late March 2005) and Ashbourne (referred to above). These
two acquisitions added some 380 care homes and 18,000 beds 
to the Group. This has resulted in significant synergy savings for
procurement at home level but in particular we have reduced 
the level of central costs required to manage the enlarged Group.
These savings are only partly reflected in the current financial
year. A full year impact will be recorded in 2007.
International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS)
As a listed group, the financial statements have been prepared 
in accordance with applicable IFRS and are effective at 1 October
2006. The primary effects of the transition to IFRS on the Group
were in relation to rental charges, in respect of operating leases,
in accordance with IAS 17. The application of IAS 17 meant that
rental charges included in the income statement increased 
by £30.7m and £4.0m in the periods to 1 October 2006 and 
2 October 2005, respectively, representing an incremental 
charge for future minimum rental increases.
Trading Activities
During the 52 weeks ended 1 October 2006, we have experienced
strong business growth through acquisitions combined with
improvements in revenue and earnings of the underlying
business. Both factors contributed to the Group’s strong operating
performance, which is summarised in the table overleaf:
The Group recorded significant growth during 
the year, through acquisition activity and organic
development. Fee income increased by 75%, on an
annualised basis, to a total for the year of £610.9m.

3 Underlying growth excludes the impact of acquisitions.
The impact of acquisitions upon the Group’s revenue and Home
EBITDA before central costs in the year amounted to £225.3m and
£65.3m respectively.
The Group results, set out in the consolidated income statement 
on page 36, show a decrease of £5.9m of operating income, 
but an increase in earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and
amortisation of goodwill (“EBITDA”) from £10.6m to £12.9m.
Excluding the charge for future minimum rental increases under
IAS 17 and exceptional central costs, Adjusted EBITDA increased by
67.0% on an annualised basis, from £15.7m to £48.8m. The loss
for the year before taxation amounted to £17.4m (2005 (28
weeks) – £2.4m).
Earnings per Share
Basic loss per share for the year was (9.4)p (2005 – (0.1)p).
Earnings per share for the year before future minimum rental
increase charges, and exceptional costs and the taxation impact
thereof, was 10.0p (2005 – 0.0p). This adjusted measure excludes
non-recurring and non-cash-based charges, however it does not
reflect a full-year impact of the new capital structure of the
Company.
Segmental Results
The Group has two distinct segments within its operations, 
namely Elderly Care and Specialist. Both segments noted
significant growth in the year primarily through acquisitions.
Elderly Care
Elderly Care recorded an increase in average available beds 
from 15,874 beds to 26,109 beds and revenue on an annualised
basis from £321.1m to £575.6m. The growth in this segment was
predominantly as a result of acquisition activity with associated
average available beds and revenue of 10,606 beds and £218.8m
respectively. The average weekly fee for Elderly Care increased by
£41.3 per week (9.7%) to £465.1 per week. The operating margin
of Elderly Care decreased slightly from 31.8% to 31.4% for the
period ended 1 October 2006. However, the decrease is
predominantly due to the comparative period being the most
profitable part of a calender year. Total Home EBITDAR before
central costs on an annualised basis increased from £102.3m 
to £181.0m. Business Review
18 Southern Cross Healthcare Group PLC   Annual Report and Accounts 2006
Specialist Care
The Specialist segment also recorded an increase in average available
beds, increasing from 701 beds to 899 beds. Revenue for the
segment increased from £28.4m on an annualised basis to £35.3m
for the 52 weeks ended 1 October 2006. The average weekly fee 
for this segment was in line with expectations at £872.6. Acquisition
activity within this sector accounted for increased average available
beds and revenue of 206 beds and £6.5m respectively. Total Home
EBITDAR before central costs on an annualised basis decreased from
£9.5m to £8.6m. Further details of acquisitions during the year are
shown in note 29.
Rent
The rent charge for the year amounted to £146.8m (2005: 28 weeks
– £40.5m). Excluding the non-cash charge under IAS17 for leases
with fixed or minimum annual increases, the rental charge for the
year was £116.1m giving a rent cover of Home EBITDAR before
central costs: cash rent of 1.63 times (2005 – 1.65 times).
Central Costs
Total central costs for the year amounted to £30.8m, an increase
of £12.8m on an annualised basis compared to central costs 
of £9.7m for the 28-week period ended 2 October 2005. The
increase is a reflection of increased central overhead as a result 
of the acquisition of the Ashbourne Group. Also included within
total central costs for the current year are exceptional costs 
of £5.2m. Excluding these non-recurring charges, central costs
amounted to £25.6m.
This adjusted central cost charge is still in excess of current
recorded levels on an annualised basis, as it does not incorporate
a full year’s cost savings as a result of synergy and restructuring,
relating to the acquisitions completed throughout the year. The
central support function of the Group has been relocated to a new
purpose-built head office in Darlington. The transition including the
integration of Ashbourne’s central support function was completed
before the year end.
Exceptional Central Costs
The Group incurred significant, non-recurring, exceptional costs
during the year, primarily as a result of restructuring following 
the acquisition of Ashbourne (£1.8m) and costs incurred in relation
to the Listing of the Company’s shares on the London Stock
Exchange (£3.1m). A full analysis of exceptional costs is disclosed
in note 4 on page 49.
Finance Income and Costs
Total net financing costs for the year amounted to £19.0m and
predominantly related to charges based on the financing structure
prior to flotation. Of the total charge, £7.0m related to interest
payable upon deep discount bonds and £5.1m related to bank
term loans in issue prior to refinancing during July 2006. The
charge for amortisation of loan arrangement fees on bank facilities
repaid in the period amounted to £3.2m.
The underlying central cost overhead has been
reduced significantly compared to the current year,
through the completion of restructuring. A full year
impact of lower central costs will be recorded in 2007. Southern Cross Healthcare Group PLC   Annual Report and Accounts 2006 19
Taxation
The tax credit on earnings before taxation of £5.3m (2005 – £1.0m
charge) represents a headline rate of 30.5% (2005 – 41.6%).
However, this headline rate is significantly affected by the tax
effect, amounting to £8.1m credit of translation adjustments to
IFRS. Such effects predominantly relate to the future tax benefit of
the additional-rental charge under IAS17. This amounts to £9.2m.
The pre-exceptional, pre-goodwill amortisation tax charge under
UK GAAP of £4.2m (2005: 28 weeks – £3.1m) represents an
effective tax rate of 25.6% (2005: 28 weeks – 55.7%) of earnings
before goodwill amortisation and exceptional costs. Excluding the
tax impact of prior year credits, predominantly a credit of £0.8m
arising from enhanced capital allowance claims, the effective rate
is 30.5%. The cause of the variance of the effective rate to the
standard rate of 30.0% is the disallowance of non-qualifying
depreciation.
Going forward, the Group expects the pre-exceptional, pre-
goodwill UK GAAP effective tax rate to remain below the standard
rate of tax.
Dividends
Total dividends paid during the year amount to Nil (2005 – Nil).
The Group has proposed a dividend of £2.1m, being 1.1p per
ordinary share, to be paid on 9 February 2007, to those
Shareholders on the register of members at close of business 
on 12 January 2007.
Non-current Assets
Non-current assets increased by £126.8m over the year to 
£310.1m, predominantly as a result of goodwill increasing to 
£196.0m through acquisitions. Property, plant and equipment
increased by £57.4m primarily as a consequence of acquisitions over
the year. However, the balance at 1 October 2006 included £27.9m
of freehold property which will be disposed after the year end. 
Financing
The Group renegotiated its borrowing facilities as part of the
refinancing process. It currently has a £60.0m term loan facility,
£50.0m development facility and £30.0m revolving credit facility
plus a £8.3m mortgage facility. The Group used the revolving
credit facility to issue £15.1m of guarantees to landlords and loan
note holders. At 1 October 2006, the total unutilised portion of
these facilities amounted to £48.5m.
Group net debt decreased during the year by £91.0m to £67.6m,
as a consequence of refinancing through the Listing process when
proceeds from the primary issue of shares plus new bank funding
were used to repay deep discount bonds, plus accrued interest
amounting to £107.1m, existing bank loans amounting 
to £121.3m and £1.7m of management loan notes.
Group net debt decreased by £91m over the year
following refinancing at IPO. AS full year impact of
reduced finance costs will be recorded in 2007. Business Review
20 Southern Cross Healthcare Group PLC   Annual Report and Accounts 2006
Group borrowings at 1 October 2006 consist of £60.0m of bank term
loans, £18.1m of bank development loans and £6.5m of mortgage
debt. The development loan is expected to be repaid shortly after the
year end through the sale of freehold properties to which it relates. 
In addition to bank borrowings the Group had £6.7m of loan notes
and £0.4m of finance lease borrowings in issue at the year end.
In July 2006 the Group entered into a three-year interest rate
swap for £30.0m, at a fixed rate of 5.07%. Under the Group’s
treasury policy, this position will be reviewed on a regular basis.
Equity
As part of its public offering process, the Group completed a bonus
issue of 240 shares: one share followed by a primary issue of 77.8m
shares. The process raised £175.0m. Issued share capital increased
to £1.9m with a share premium account of £173.1m. In addition,
£11.6m of legal and professional costs directly attributable to 
the primary issue of shares have been offset against the share
premium account.

Net cash inflow from operations was £50.6m (2005 – £15.0m),
representing a cash conversion ratio compared to Adjusted 
EBITDA of 103.7% (2005 – 95.6%).
Net cash flow from investing activities amounted to £72.0m
outflow (2005 (28 weeks) – £30.4m inflow). Gross investing
activities amounted to £123.9m, being £94.8m investment on
acquisition of subsidiaries, £14.2m representing development
capital, predominantly freeholds, and £14.9m representing
maintenance capital. Excluding the acquisition of Ashbourne, the
Group invested £55.4m on new subsidiaries. Disposal proceeds
relating to the disposal of subsidiary undertakings and freehold
properties amounted to £51.9m (2005 (28 weeks) – £97.3m). 
This frequency of acquisition and disposal of subsidiary entities 
is consistent with our sale and leaseback funding model.
The business continues to benefit from stable and
predictable cash flows with a cash conversion ratio
of Adjusted EBITDA of 104%. The net cash outflow from interest charges amounted to £27.1m
(2005: 28 weeks – £5.7m). The increase was primarily due to
settlement of £11.0m of accrued interest upon the redemption of
shareholder deep discount bonds and £6.5m upon loan notes. The
remainder relates to increased bank borrowings for the Ashbourne
acquisition (see below).
As described earlier, the capital structure has now been changed
and future interest payments will be significantly reduced as a
result.
The net cash flow from financing for the year amounted to
£67.8m inflow (2005: 28 weeks – £34.2m outflow). In November
2005, the Group initially increased bank borrowings by £40.7m
and issued deep discount bonds amounting to £32.3m as part of
the Ashbourne acquisition. Existing loan notes within Ashbourne
amounting to £18.0m were repaid as part of the acquisition. 
As part of the Listing upon the London Stock Exchange, £175.0m
was raised through a primary issue of shares and £67.2m through
new bank loan finance which was used to redeem £96.1m of
deep discount bonds in issue plus associated accrued interest 
of £11.0m. Existing bank loan finance amounting to £121.3m 
and management loan notes of £1.7m were also repaid.
The increase in cash and cash equivalents during the year was
£17.7m (2005: 28 weeks – £4.2m) resulting in a year end 
balance of £21.9m (2005 – £4.2m).
Conclusion
2006 has been another strong year for Southern Cross Healthcare.
The integration of acquisitions is complete and we have seen
strong underlying growth and cash generation in our existing
businesses. Refinancing as part of the Listing on the London 
Stock Exchange has strengthened our balance sheet and we have
new banking facilities in place. The Group is well positioned for
future growth.

the financial period.
The Directors consider that in preparing the consolidated financial statements and the Company financial statements, the Group and
Company have used appropriate accounting policies, consistently applied and supported by reasonable and prudent judgements and
estimates, and that all applicable accounting standards have been followed.
Each person who is a Director at the date of approval of this report confirms that:
l so far as the Director is aware, there is no relevant audit information of which the Company’s Auditors are unaware; and
l each Director has taken all the steps that he/she ought to have taken as a Director to make himself/herself aware of any relevant
audit information and to establish that the Company’s Auditors are aware of that information.
This confirmation is given and should be interpreted in accordance with the provisions of Section 234 ZA of the Companies Act 1985.
The Directors are responsible for keeping proper accounting records that disclose with reasonable accuracy the financial position of the
Company and the Group and to enable them to ensure that the financial statements comply with the Companies Act 1985. They are also
responsible for safeguarding the assets of the Group and Company and for taking reasonable steps for the prevention and detection of
fraud and other irregularities.
The Annual Report will also be published on the Company’s website. The Directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity of 
the Company’s website, the work performed by the Auditors does not include consideration of these matters. Accordingly the auditors

website.
Legislation in the UK concerning the preparation and publication of financial statements may differ from legislation in other jurisdictions.
Southern Cross Healthcare Group PLC   Annual Report and Accounts 2006 25 Corporate Governance
The Board supports the principles of corporate governance set out in the Combined Code on Corporate Governance issued by the Financial
Reporting Standards Council in July 2003 (“the Combined Code”). This statement describes how the principles of the Combined Code have
been applied to the Group. 
The Group was admitted onto the London Stock Exchange on 12 July 2006. Prior to this date the Group was privately held and operated a
corporate governance system that the Directors considered to be appropriate for a privately-held Group. As part of the process of preparing
for admission onto the London Stock Exchange the Group commenced a rigorous and continuous corporate governance project, using the
provisions of the Combined Code. The information below details how the principals of the Combined Code have been applied from the
date of admission up to the period ended 1 October 2006, the “Post-Admission Period”.
The Board
The Board currently comprises four Non-Executive and three Executive Directors, in addition to the Non-Executive Chairman. As Joseph
Barratta is nominated by the Blackstone Shareholders, the most significant Shareholder, he is not regarded as “independent” for the
purposes of the Combined Code. 
Accordingly, independent Non-Executive Directors, excluding the Chairman, make up less than half of the Board. It is the Board’s opinion,
however, that the current Board membership is the most appropriate to the circumstances and that no individual, or small group of
individuals can dominate the Board’s decision making.
The roles of the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer are clearly defined, approved by the Board and separate. The Chairman 
is responsible for leading the Board in determining the Group’s strategy, achieving its objectives and organising the business of 
the Board. The Chief Executive Officer is responsible for the executive management of the Group’s operations and day-to-day activities.
The Board meets, formally, bi-monthly and additional meetings are arranged as necessary to consider urgent business. The Chairman also
holds meetings with the Non-Executive Directors.
The table below summarises the total number of Board, Audit Committee, Nomination Committee and Remuneration Committee meetings
during the Post-Admission Period and the attendance by each Director.

Joseph Baratta 2 2
Baroness Morgan of Huyton 1 1 –
Christopher Fisher 22 2
The Board is responsible for setting the Group’s strategy, assessing and managing risk and monitoring the financial performance of the
Group. To assist in the effective running of the Board a comprehensive set of documents, including financial performance, operational
issues, reports on developments and acquisitions and compliance matters are provided to the Board on a timely basis. The Board has 
a formal schedule of matters reserved for its approval, these matters include approval of the annual strategic plan and budgets and 
the review of overall corporate governance arrangements.
26 Southern Cross Healthcare Group PLC   Annual Report and Accounts 2006 The Chairman has responsibility for the induction process in respect of new Directors. The process includes industry specific presentations
from third parties and management presentations. Directors can take independent advice on matters relating to their duties, at the
expense of the Company, and have access to the advice and services of the Company Secretary. The removal from office of the Company
Secretary is a matter reserved for the whole Board.
The Board is committed to the principle that there should be an annual evaluation of its own performance and of individual Directors. 
The Non-Executive Directors, led by the senior independent Non-Executive Director are responsible for evaluating the performance of 
the Chairman and the executive members of the Board.
Committees of the Board
The Board has Audit, Remuneration and Nomination Committees, the roles and terms of reference of each are summarised below.
Audit Committee
During the period the Board has established a formal Audit Committee, comprised of three independent Non-Executive Directors (namely
Christopher Fisher, Ray Miles and Baroness Morgan of Huyton). Mr Christopher Fisher, the Committee’s Chairman, was formerly Vice
Chairman of Corporate Finance at KPMG and a Managing Director of Lazard and brings financial expertise to the committee.
The committee meets formally at least three times a year and otherwise as required. The external Auditors, Group Finance Director 
and Group Financial Controller are invited to attend the Audit Committee meetings. Part of each meeting is held in private between 
the Non-Executive Directors and the external Auditors.
The committee has clearly defined terms of reference; these are set out on the Group’s website. Its responsibilities include: assisting the
Board in the effective discharge of its duties in respect of Corporate Governance; financial reporting; risk management and internal control.
The independence and objectivity of the external Auditors is reviewed by the Audit Committee, with specific consideration of the level of
non–audit fees. Information on non-audit fees is given in note 6 to the consolidated financial statements. During the period the Auditors
provided significant services in respect of the listing of the Company’s shares on the London Stock Exchange. The committee does not
consider the non-audit fees paid to the external Auditors to have affected their independence or objectivity.
The committee also receives an annual independence confirmation from the external Auditors.
The committee is responsible for making recommendations to the Board in relation to the appointment, reappointment and any matters 
of resignation or dismissal of the external Auditors as well as the approval of fees for external Auditors.
The committee also has responsibility for reviewing the Group’s procedures by which employees may, in confidence, raise concerns about
improprieties in matters of financial reporting or other matters and to ensure these arrangements allow for independent investigation and
appropriate follow up. 
Remuneration Committee 
During the period the Board has established a Remuneration Committee comprised of three Non-Executive Directors (namely Ray Miles,
Christopher Fisher and Joseph Baratta). The Chairman of the committee is Ray Miles.
The Combined Code suggests that the Remuneration Committee should consist of at least three Directors who are all independent 
Non-Executive Directors. As Joseph Baratta is not considered to be independent the Group does not comply with provision B2.1 of 
the Combined Code. It is the Board’s opinion that, as the nominee of the Blackstones Shareholders, Joseph Baratta’s views are 
desirable to assist the Remuneration Committee to assess the remuneration packages for the senior executives.

Remuneration Committee continued
The composition and role of the Remuneration Committee are set out in the report of the Remuneration Committee on pages 30 to 33. 
Full details of Directors’ remuneration and shareholdings are also given in the report.
Nominations Committee
During the period the Board has established a Nominations Committee comprised of three independent Non-Executive Directors (namely
William Colvin, Ray Miles and Baroness Morgan of Huyton). The Chairman of the committee is William Colvin. The committee meets
formally at least twice a year and otherwise as required.
The committee assists the Board in discharging its responsibilities relating to the composition and make up of the Board. It is responsible
for evaluating the balance of skills, knowledge and experience on the Board, identifying potential candidates to be appointed as Directors,
as the need may arise, and determining succession planning for the Chairman and Chief Executive. External executive recruitment agencies
are used to assist in the identification of suitable candidates. 
The committee’s terms of reference are set out on the Group’s website.
Internal Control and Risk Management
The Board has overall responsibility for the Group’s system of internal controls and risk management. The system includes an ongoing
process for identifying, evaluating and managing significant risks faced by the Group. The process is designed to manage rather than
eliminate the risk of failure to achieve business objectives. As with, any system of internal control it can only provide reasonable, 
but not absolute, assurance against material misstatement or loss.
The key elements of the Group’s system of internal control are:
Risk Management
The Board is responsible for risk assessment and management within the Group. During the period the Board has established the Group
Risk Management Committee (“GRMC”) and has delegated the responsibility to this committee. Included within the GRMC’s responsibilities
are setting Group policy and strategy for risk management, identifying, assessing and managing risks facing the Group and communicating,
educating and training employees on the risks facing the Group.
The GRMC has representatives from finance, operations, legal, human resources, estates, health and safety and compliance. It meets on a
bi-monthly basis and reports into the Board, via the Audit Committee.
The Board has put in place a documented organisational structure with clearly defined and understood roles and responsibilities. There are
also established and documented policies and procedures at the home level, and the Group is in the process of implementing documented
policies and procedures for the head office finance function.
Management Information Systems
The Group has a comprehensive management information system for regular and timely reporting into the Board. The monthly financial
reporting system includes period and period to date results compared to budget, details of key performance indicators against budget,
working capital movements and detailed cash flow information. The monthly management reporting system includes information on
internal and external, regulatory and compliance audits, health and safety and other operational matters.
Effectiveness of Internal Controls
The Board confirms that it has reviewed the effectiveness of the system of internal controls, in accordance with the Turnbull Guidance, 
and is satisfied that the Group complies with that guidance.
Investor Relations
The Board supports the view that effective communications with its Shareholders, stakeholders and the wider market is a critical element
of corporate governance. The Chairman has overall responsibility for ensuring effective communication with the Group’s stakeholders and
to ensure the Board develops an understanding of the views of key stakeholders. 
The Group’s Annual and Interim Reports will be the primary method by which information is communicated to our stakeholders. In addition
there is also regular dialogue with individual institutional Shareholders and general meetings will be held after the announcement of
interim and preliminary results. It is the intention of the Senior Independent Director to be present at these meetings. 
28 Southern Cross Healthcare Group PLC   Annual Report and Accounts 2006 The Group’s Annual General Meeting shall be used as an opportunity to communicate with private investors and to give all ordinary
Shareholders the opportunity to ask questions of the Directors. 
In an effort to communicate more readily with an audience of stakeholders, the Group’s website has been developed so as to incorporate
an investor relations page. A Group profile, statutory financial statements, all announcements and regular corporate news are included.
Internal Audit
Throughout the period, the Regional Administrator and Operational Manager groups have performed financial and operational compliance
work at the home level. To help ensure compliance, the Group has a quality assurance department that assists in training both groups 
on internal compliance techniques and also ensures a uniform approach is adopted across the Group. 
The Board is satisfied that the work performed by the external Auditors in preparation for Admission together with the current internal
compliance structure of the Group was sufficient for the period under review. However, the Board will be reviewing the internal audit
requirements of the Group in the year ahead.
Going Concern
After making enquiries the Directors have a reasonable expectation that the Group and Company have adequate resources to continue
operations for the foreseeable future. For this reason the financial statements continue to be prepared on the going-concern basis.
Compliance Statement
The Board confirms that for the period since the Company’s shares were listed on the London Stock Exchange (being 12 July 2006 to 
1 October 2006), it has been in compliance with the provisions set out in Section 1 of the Combined Code, except that:
i) During this period, the Remuneration Committee membership was not made up entirely of independent Non-Executive Directors; and
ii) During this period, independent Non-Executive Directors, excluding the Chairman, did not make up half of the Board.

Southern Cross Healthcare Group PLC   Annual Report and Accounts 2006 29 Remuneration Report
Introduction
The Remuneration Committee presents its report and information on Directors’ remuneration. This report is un-audited except for those
parts which are stated as being audited.
The Remuneration Committee and its Role
The Remuneration Committee comprises of three Non-Executive Directors (namely Ray Miles, Christopher Fisher and Joseph Baratta). 
The Chairman of the committee is Ray Miles. The committee meets formally at least twice a year and otherwise as required.
The committee has clearly defined terms of reference; these are set out on the Group’s website. Its responsibilities include making
recommendations to the Board on the Group’s framework of remuneration for executive management, reviewing the ongoing
appropriateness and relevance of the remuneration policy and determining, on behalf of the Board, specific remuneration packages 
for each of the Executive Directors and the Chairman of the Board. 
During the period the committee has taken advice from New Bridge Street Consultants and Deloitte & Touche. Advice was taken on a wide
range of issues, including the current market positioning of the Group’s executive remuneration with regard to other listed groups.
Remuneration Policy
This report sets out the Company’s policy on Directors’ remuneration for the financial year 2006 and, so far as practical, for future years. 
Any changes in policy for future years will be described in future Remuneration Reports. The Company’s overall policy on remuneration 
is to attract, develop, motivate and retain individuals at all levels, pay competitive salaries and align remuneration arrangements with 
the Group’s strategy and objectives.
As part of the process of preparing for Admission onto the London Stock Exchange, and using the expertise of third party consultants, 
a comprehensive review of Executive remuneration was undertaken. Following this the Board’s policy on Executive remuneration is to:
l pay basic salaries that are competitive with other companies of similar size and standing;
l to have a significant part of remuneration linked to the achievement of performance targets;
l to have performance-related remuneration aligned to the interests of shareholders; and 
l encourage executives to hold shares in the Company.
In establishing these policies, the Board has given full consideration to the requirements of the Combined Code.
Executive Remuneration Packages
Executive remuneration packages for the current period comprised basic salary and benefits, annual performance-related bonus, long-term
share incentives and pension benefits. Further details of each element are given below:
Basic Salary and Benefits
The Committee reviews basic salary and benefits each year, taking into consideration Group financial performance, individual responsibilities,
skills and experience. Consideration is also given to the salaries and benefits paid to Executives by other companies of similar size and
standing. The last such review took place during the process of preparing for Admission onto the London Stock Exchange.
Basic salaries for the Executive Directors are a fixed annual sum payable monthly in cash. The value of benefits for Executive Directors is
included in the remuneration table on page 32 and consists of car allowance and life and health insurance.
Annual Performance-related Bonus
During the period from 3 October 2005 to 12 July 2006 (Admission date) each Executive Director participated in the Southern Cross
Healthcare Group Limited bonus scheme, all awards were entirely discretionary and decided upon by the Board at that time.
During the period from Admission to 1 October 2006, eligibility to receive a bonus was at the discretion of the Remuneration Committee. 
In respect of the financial year 2007 Directors are entitled to receive a bonus of up to 50% of basic salary, subject to attainment of certain
performance targets based on the Group’s earnings before interest tax, depreciation and amortisation. The Directors are also eligible to
receive a further bonus equal to 20% of basic salary, subject to the discretion of the Remuneration Committee and approval by the Board.
30 Southern Cross Healthcare Group PLC   Annual Report and Accounts 2006 Performance Share Plan
The Southern Cross Healthcare Group 2006 Performance Share Plan (“the PSP”) was adopted by the Company in June 2006. Awards under
the PSP are on an annual allocation of notional ordinary shares equivalent in value to a maximum of 100% of annual basic salary as at the
award date, unless the Remuneration Committee decides that exceptional circumstances exist in relation to the recruitment or retention of
an employee, in which case the limit will be 200% of annual basic salary. 
On 4 September 2006, 2,365,332 awards were granted with an exercise price of £Nil. A summary of the vesting conditions are included below.
Vesting of awards made under the PSP takes place at the expiry of the three-year performance period of the plan and are subject to
attainment of agreed performance targets. 70% of the award will vest on attainment of a performance target based on Earnings Per Share
(“EPS”). For the purposes of calculating the EPS condition, net income is defined as profit after taxation before deduction of future minimum
rental increases, goodwill impairment, annual bonuses paid to participants in the PSP and the cost of share options charged to the income
statement under the PSP . The remaining 30% will vest on attainment of a performance target based on Total Shareholder Return (“TSR”).
In respect of the EPS performance target, 100% of the award will vest if the PSP EPS for the 2008 financial period exceeds 23.13p per
share and no awards will vest if PSP EPS is below 18.61p per share, with straight-line vesting between these two points. The remaining
30% will vest subject to TSR performance measured against the constituents of the FTSE 250 Index, excluding investment trusts. 100% 
of the award will vest if the Company’s TSR growth is in the upper quartile and 40% will vest if growth is at the median, with straight-line
vesting between the two points. If the Company’s growth is below the median then no awards shall vest.
The calculation below shows how the Group has performed against the PSP EPS earnings per share measure, during the year.

The Remuneration Committee considers the targets to be appropriate and will review targets for future awards on an annual basis.
Pension Benefits
All Executive Directors are entitled to money purchase benefits equal to 15% of annual salary. Bonuses and awards made under the PSP
are not pensionable.

Upon Admission the Executive Directors entered into new service agreements with the Company. The Executive Director service
agreements provide that the notice required to terminate their employment is 12 months given either by the Director or the Company. 
The Company also has the right to terminate the employment of an Executive Director without notice or with less than 12 months notice
by making a payment in lieu of notice equal to the base salary and contractual benefits the Executive Director would be entitled to receive
during any un-expired part of the notice period.
Under the terms of the Executive Directors’ new service agreements, Philip Scott is entitled to receive a basic salary of £335,000 per
annum, whilst John Murphy and Graham Sizer are both entitled to receive basic salaries of £300,000 per annum. Each Executive Director

responsibilities.
Our responsibility is to audit the financial statements in accordance with relevant legal and regulatory requirements and International
Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland). This report, including the opinion, has been prepared for and only for the Company’s members as
a body in accordance with Section 235 of the Companies Act 1985 and for no other purpose. We do not, in giving this opinion, accept or

required to consider whether the Board’s statements on internal control cover all risks and controls, or form an opinion on the
effectiveness of the Group’s corporate governance procedures or its risk and control procedures.
We read other information contained in the Annual Report and consider whether it is consistent with the audited financial statements. 
The other information comprises only the Directors’ report, the unaudited part of the remuneration report, the Chairman’s statement, 
the business review and the financial review and the corporate governance statement. We consider the implications for our report if we
become aware of any apparent misstatements or material inconsistencies with the financial statements. Our responsibilities do not extend
to any other information.
Basis of Audit Opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland) issued by the Auditing Practices Board. 
An audit includes examination, on a test basis, of evidence relevant to the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. It also
includes an assessment of the significant estimates and judgements made by the Directors in the preparation of the financial statements,
and of whether the accounting policies are appropriate to the Group’s circumstances, consistently applied and adequately disclosed.
We planned and performed our audit so as to obtain all the information and explanations which we considered necessary in order to
provide us with sufficient evidence to give reasonable assurance that the financial statements are free from material misstatement,
whether caused by fraud or other irregularity or error. In forming our opinion we also evaluated the overall adequacy of the presentation
of information in the financial statements.
34 Southern Cross Healthcare Group PLC   Annual Report and Accounts 2006 Opinion
In our opinion:
l the Group financial statements give a true and fair view, in accordance with IFRS as adopted by the European Union, of the state 
of the Group’s affairs as at 1 October 2006 and of its loss and cash flows for the 52 week period then ended;
l the financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 1985 and Article 4 of the IAS Regulation;
and
l the information given in the Directors’ report is consistent with the financial statements.

38 Southern Cross Healthcare Group PLC   Annual Report and Accounts 2006 1 Basis of Preparation
Following admission to the Official List, the Group is required to prepare statutory consolidated financial statements which comply with
IFRS as adopted for use in the EU for the period ended 1 October 2006 (the “2006 financial statements”) and subsequently.
The Group’s principal activities are the development and operation of care homes for the elderly and the provision of specialist services 
for people with physical and/or learning disabilities.
This financial information has been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) (and IFRIC interpretations)
endorsed by the EU and with those parts of the Companies Act, 1985, applicable to companies reporting under IFRS. The financial
information has been prepared under the historical cost convention, with the exception of certain financial instruments, which are recognised
at fair value.
This is the Group’s first consolidated financial information prepared in accordance with IFRS. Accordingly, IFRS 1, “First Time Adoption of IFRS”
(revised 2004) has been applied. IFRS 1 permits companies adopting IFRS for the first time to take exemptions from applying the full
requirements of IFRS to certain items. In preparing this financial information, the Group has applied the following:
l As permitted, the implementation of IAS 32, “Financial Instruments: Disclosure and Presentation”, and IAS 39, “Financial Instruments:
Recognition and Measurement”, has been applied from 10 January 2005.
At the period end, the following standards and interpretations relevant to the Group, but which have not yet been adopted, were in issue
but not yet effective:
IFRS 7 “Financial Instruments Disclosure”
IAS 1 “Presentation of Financial Statements” (amended)
IAS 19 “Employee benefits”
IAS 39 “Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement” (amended)
IFRIC 4 “Determining Whether an Arrangement contains a Lease”
IFRIC 9 “Reassessment of Embedded Derivatives” (yet to be adopted by the EU)
The Group does not anticipate that the adoption of these standards and interpretations will have a material impact on the Group’s 
financial statements on adoption.
The preparation of financial information in conformity with IFRS requires the use of estimates and assumptions that affect the reported
amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the
reporting period. Although these estimates are based on management’s best knowledge of the amount, events or actions, actual results
ultimately may differ from those estimates.
The financial information presented is for the 28 weeks ended 2 October 2005 (the “financial period ended 2 October 2005”) and the 
52 weeks ended 1 October 2006 (the “financial year ended 1 October 2006”). The Group prepares its financial information for the financial
year ending on the nearest Sunday to 30 September of a given calendar year.
Development of the Group
The Company was incorporated on 10 January 2005. On 23 March 2005, through a Group reconstruction, Southern Cross Healthcare 
Group Limited acquired the entire share capital of Southern Cross Bidco Limited through its subsidiary undertaking Southern Cross
Healthcare Investments No. 2 Limited.
On 8 April 2005, Southern Cross Bidco Limited acquired the Highfield Care (“Highfield”) trading business from funds controlled by the
Blackstone Group.
On 30 October 2005, Southern Cross Bidco Limited acquired the entire share capital of Cannon Capital Ventures Limited (“Ashbourne”).
On 13 June 2006, the Company re-registered as a PLC.
On 12 July 2006, the Company’s ordinary shares were admitted to the London Stock Exchange through an Initial Public Offering.

Development of the Group continued
Further details of the above acquisitions and other acquisitions are given in note 29. The consolidated financial information of the Group
represents the following:
28 weeks ended 2 October 2005
The consolidated financial information of Southern Cross Healthcare Group Limited, incorporating the effects of the Group reconstruction 
on 23 March 2005, and including:
l the consolidated financial information of Southern Cross Healthcare Group Limited and its subsidiaries for the period from 
10 January 2005 to 2 October 2005; and
l the consolidated financial information of Highfield from 9 April 2005 to 2 October 2005.
52 weeks ended 1 October 2006
The consolidated financial information of Southern Cross Healthcare Group PLC, including:
l the consolidated financial information of Southern Cross Healthcare Group PLC and its subsidiaries for the period from 3 October 2005 
to 1 October 2006; and
l the consolidated financial information of Ashbourne from 31 October 2005 to 1 October 2006.
The principal companies within the Group are disclosed in note 36.
2 Accounting Policies
The principal accounting policies adopted in the preparation of the financial statements are set out below. These policies have been
consistently applied to all the financial periods presented unless otherwise stated.
Basis of Consolidation
The consolidated financial statements incorporate the financial statements of the Company and entities controlled by the Company 
(its subsidiaries) made up to 2 October 2005 and 1 October 2006. Control is achieved where the Company has the power to govern the
financial and operating policies of an entity so as to obtain benefits from its activities. The existence and effect of potential voting rights
that are currently exercisable or convertible are considered when assessing whether the Group controls another entity.
On acquisition, the assets and liabilities and contingent liabilities of a subsidiary are measured at their fair values at the date of acquisition.
Intangible assets in acquired companies which concern resident contracts are recognised and amortised over periods of up to three years.
Any excess of the cost of acquisition over the fair values of the identifiable net assets acquired is capitalised as goodwill. Goodwill is not
amortised; instead impairment tests are made annually, and any impairment is charged to the income statement. Any deficiency of the
cost of acquisition below the fair values of the identifiable net assets acquired (ie discount on acquisition) is credited to the income
statement in the period of acquisition.
The results of subsidiaries acquired or disposed of during the period are included in the consolidated income statement from the effective
date of acquisition or up to the effective date of disposal, as appropriate. Where necessary, adjustments are made to the financial
statements of subsidiaries to bring the accounting policies used into line with those used by the Group. All intra-group transactions,
balances, income and expenses are eliminated on consolidation.
Revenue Recognition
Revenue comprises the fair value of fee income relating to the provision of care services, net of price reductions directly related to sales.
Fee income comprises care home fees which are recognised when delivery of service is completed. Fees invoiced in advance are included
as deferred income until service is completed.
40 Southern Cross Healthcare Group PLC   Annual Report and Accounts 2006 2 Accounting Policies continued
Home Payroll Costs
Home payroll costs represent payroll costs directly incurred at home level, including costs incurred in respect of the use of agency labour.
Home Running Costs
Home running costs represent costs of items directly incurred at home level, including food and kitchen supplies, medical supplies, utilities,
maintenance and other running costs of the home.
Home EBITDAR before Central Costs
Home EBITDAR before central costs represents profitability at a home level after taking account of home payroll and home running costs,
but before rental charges on operating leases, central costs and depreciation on home assets.
Home EBITDA before Central Costs
Home EBITDA before central costs represents profitability at a home level after taking account of home payroll and home running costs 
and rental charges in operating leases, but before central costs and depreciation on home assets.
Central Costs
Central costs represent costs of head office support functions, including central payroll costs, other costs not directly attributable to 
a home level and certain other payroll costs.
EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA
EBITDA represents earnings before depreciation, amortisation and profit on disposal of property, plant and equipment. Adjusted EBITDA
represents EBITDA after adding back exceptional central costs and the charge for future minimum rental increases. 
The Group believes that EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA (and measures derived therefrom including Home EBITDAR before central costs 
and Home EBITDA before central costs) facilitate operating performance comparisons from period to period and company to company 
by eliminating potential differences caused by variations in capital structures (affecting finance income and costs), tax positions, 
the age and book depreciation of property, plant and equipment (affecting relative depreciation expense) and intangible assets 
identified (affecting amortisation expense).
Exceptional Items
Exceptional items are events or transactions that fall within the activities of the Group and which, by virtue of their size or incidence, have
been disclosed in order to improve a reader’s understanding of the financial information.
Use of Boxes in Income Statement
Boxes have been used in the income statement to provide sub-analyses of items in order to improve a reader’s understanding of the
financial information.
Segmental Reporting
A business segment is a group of assets and operations engaged in providing products or services that are subject to risks and returns 
that are different from those of other business segments. A geographical segment is engaged in providing products or services within 
a particular economic environment that are subject to risks and returns that are different from those of segments operating in other
economic environments.
Based on an analysis of risks and returns, the directors consider that the Group has two identifiable business segments: Elderly Care and
Specialist.
All operations of the Group are carried out in the United Kingdom and therefore no geographical segmentation is disclosed. Consequently,
the Group has considered business segmentation as the primary segmentation, with two reportable segments, Elderly Care and Specialist.
Other Income
Other income relates to management income received in respect of a portfolio of homes operated by the Group on behalf of a third party,
as well as other operating income. Income is recognised on completion of the management service on an accruals basis.

For the 52 weeks ended 1 October 2006
2 Accounting Policies continued
Share-based Payments
Equity-settled Transactions
The cost of equity-settled transactions with employees is measured by reference to the fair value at the date at which they are granted
and is recognised as an expense over the vesting period, which ends on the date on which the relevant employees become fully entitled
to the award. Fair value is determined by an external valuer using an appropriate pricing model. In valuing equity-settled transactions, 
no account is taken of any vesting conditions, other than conditions linked to the price of the shares of the Company (market conditions).
No expense is recognised for awards that do not ultimately vest, except for awards where vesting is conditional upon a market condition,
which are treated as vesting irrespective of whether or not the market condition is satisfied, provided that all other performance conditions
are satisfied.
At each balance sheet date before vesting, the cumulative expense is calculated, representing the extent to which the vesting period has
expired and management’s best estimate of the achievement or otherwise of non-market conditions number of equity instruments that
will ultimately vest or in the case of an instrument subject to a market condition, be treated as vesting as described above. The movement
in cumulative expense since the previous balance sheet date is recognised in the income statement, with a corresponding entry in equity.
Financial Instruments
Derivative Financial Instruments and Hedging
The Group uses derivative financial instruments such as interest rate swaps to hedge its risks associated with interest rate fluctuations. 
Such derivative financial instruments are initially recognised at fair value on the date on which a derivative contract is entered into and 
are subsequently measured at fair value. 
Derivatives are carried as assets when the fair value is positive and as liabilities when the fair value is negative.
For cash flow hedges, the effective portion of the gain or loss on the hedging instrument is recognised directly in equity, while the
ineffective position is recognised in the income statement. Amounts taken to equity are transferred to the income statement when 
the hedged transaction affects profit or loss, such as when a forecast sale or purchase occurs. 
Where the hedged item is the cost of a non-financial asset or liability, the amounts taken to equity are transferred to the initial carrying
amount of the non-financial asset or liability.
If a forecast transaction is no longer expected to occur, amounts previously recognised in equity are transferred to the income statement. 
If the hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated or exercised without replacement or rollover, or if its designation as a hedge is
revoked, amounts previously recognised in equity remain in equity until the forecast transaction occurs and are transferred to the income
statement or to the initial carrying amount of a non financial asset or liability as above. If the related transaction is not expected to occur,
the amount is taken to the income statement.
Leases
Assets held under finance leases, which transfer to the Group substantially all the risks and benefits incidental to ownership of the leased
item, are capitalised at inception of the lease, with a corresponding liability being recognised for the value of the leased asset or, if lower,
the present value of the minimum lease payments. Assets held under finance leases are depreciated over the shorter of the estimated
useful economic life or the lease term.
Leases where the lessor retains substantially all the risks and benefits of ownership of the asset are classified as operating leases and
rentals payable are charged in the income statement on a straight-line basis over the lease term where property lease contracts contain
guaranteed minimum incremental rental payments, the total committed cost is determined and is calculated and amortised on a straight-
line basis over the lease term. The charge for rentals currently payable is the actual amount payable, in the period, by the Group for its
operating leases. The charge for future minimum rental increases reflects the impact of recognising future-fixed committed rental increases
on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
42 Southern Cross Healthcare Group PLC   Annual Report and Accounts 2006 2 Accounting Policies continued
Onerous Leases
Provision is made for future operating lease payments of vacant care homes for the full remaining lease term or up to the expected point
at which the lease is expected to be sublet.
Property, Plant and Equipment
Property, plant and equipment is stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment losses. Such losses include
costs directly attributable to making the asset capable of operating as intended. Borrowing costs attributable to assets under construction
are recognised as an expense as incurred.
Depreciation is provided on all property, plant and equipment at rates calculated to write off the cost, less estimated residual value based
on prices prevailing at the balance sheet date, of each asset evenly over its estimated useful life as follows:
l Freehold buildings – 2% per annum
l Short leasehold property – over life of lease
l Motor vehicles – 25% per annum
l Fixtures and fittings – 14% per annum
l Computer equipment – 33
1
⁄ 3% per annum
The carrying value of property, plant and equipment is reviewed for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate the
carrying value may not be recoverable. Gains and losses on the sale of property, plant and equipment are recognised under central costs,
unless they are so material as to be disclosed separately.
Intangibles
Goodwill
Business combinations completed on or after 10 January 2005 are accounted for under IFRS 3 using the purchase method. Any excess 
of cost of the business combination over the Group’s interest in the net fair value of the identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent
liabilities is recognised in the balance sheet as goodwill and is not amortised. To the extent that the net fair value of the acquired 
entity’s identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities is greater than the costs of investment, a gain is recognised immediately 
in the income statement.
After initial recognition, goodwill is stated at cost less any accumulated impairment losses, with the carrying value being reviewed for
impairment, at least annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may be impaired.
For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill is allocated to the related cash generating units monitored by management, at the
segment level. Where the recoverable amount of the cash generating unit is less than its carrying amount, including goodwill, an
impairment loss is recognised in the income statement.
Other Intangibles
Intangible assets are carried at cost less accumulated amortisation and impairment losses.
An intangible asset acquired as part of a business combination is recognised outside of goodwill if the asset is separable or arises from
contractual or other legal rights and its fair value can be measured reliably. Intangible assets with a finite life are amortised on a straight-
line basis over their estimated useful lives, as follows:
l Resident contracts – three years
The carrying value of intangibles is reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may
not be recoverable.
Southern Cross Healthcare Group PLC   Annual Report and Accounts 2006 43 Notes to the IFRS Financial Information
For the 52 weeks ended 1 October 2006
2 Accounting Policies continued
Employee Benefit Costs
Staff costs comprise salaries, wages and pensions for the Group’s staff as well as other staff costs. The Group operates defined contribution
pension plans, which are plans under which the Group pays fixed contributions into a separate entity. The Group has no legal or
constructive obligations to pay further contributions if the fund does not hold sufficient assets to pay all employees the benefits relating 
to employee service in the current and prior periods. Contributions are recognised as employee benefit expenses as they fall due.
Inventories
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Where necessary, impairment is made for obsolete, slow moving 
and defective stocks.
Taxation including Deferred Tax
The tax expense represents the sum of the tax currently payable and deferred tax.
The tax currently payable is based on taxable profit for the year. Taxable profit differs from net profit as reported in the income statement
because it excludes items of income or expense that are taxable or deductible in other years and it further excludes items that are never
taxable or deductible. The Group’s liability for current tax is calculated using tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted 
by the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is the tax expected to be payable or recoverable on differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities 
in the financial statements and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable profit, and is accounted for using 
the balance sheet liability method. Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised for all taxable temporary differences and deferred 
tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available against which deductible temporary
differences can be utilised. Such assets and liabilities are not recognised if the temporary difference arises from goodwill or from the 
initial recognition (other than in a business combination) of other assets and liabilities in a transaction that affects neither the tax profit 
nor the accounting profit.
Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for taxable temporary differences arising on investments in subsidiaries, except where the Group 
is able to control the reversal of the temporary difference and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the
foreseeable future.
The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each balance sheet date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable
that sufficient taxable profits will be available against which the temporary differences can be utilised. Deferred tax is calculated at the tax
rates that are expected to apply in the period when the liability is settled or the asset is realised. 
Deferred tax is charged or credited in the income statement, except when it relates to items charged or credited directly to reserves, 
in which case the deferred tax is also dealt with in reserves.
Cash and Cash Equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents includes cash and balances in accounts at no or short notice. Bank overdrafts are shown within borrowings in
current liabilities; however they are included as a component of cash and cash equivalents for the purposes of the cash flow statement.
Finance Costs
Financial costs include interest and amortisation of loan arrangement fees. Loan arrangement fees are amortised evenly over the term 
of the associated loan instrument.
Finance Income
Finance income is accrued on a time basis by reference to the principal outstanding and at the effective interest rate applicable.
44 Southern Cross Healthcare Group PLC   Annual Report and Accounts 2006 2 Accounting Policies continued
Receivables
Trade receivables defined in accordance with IAS 39 are recorded initially at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost using
the effective interest method for any doubtful amounts. A provision for impairment of trade receivables is established when there is
evidence that the Group will not be able to collect all amounts due according to the original terms of the receivables. The amount of the
provision is the difference between the assets’ carrying amount and the present value of future cash flows discounted at the effective
interest rate. The movement in the provision is recognised in the income statement.
Any other trade receivables are recognised at their original amount less an allowance for any doubtful amounts. An allowance is made
when collection of the full amount is no longer considered probable.
Other Liabilities
Other liabilities primarily comprise holiday pay liabilities, income taxes, other taxes and interest payable, which are measured 
at the best estimate of the expenditure required to settle the obligation. Other liabilities also comprise the fair value of derivative 
financial instruments.
Financial Risk Management
The Group’s activities expose it primarily to the financial risks of changes in interest rates and liquidity risk. The Board reviews and agrees
policies for managing each of these risks, and others and they are summarised below.
Interest Rate Risk
The Group’s interest rate risk arises from long-term borrowings which are issued at variable rates that expose the Group to cash flow
interest rate risk.
The interest exposure of the Group is managed within the constraints of the Group’s business plan and the financial covenants under its
facilities. The Group aims to reduce exposure to the effect of interest rate movements by hedging an appropriate amount of interest rate
exposure. The impact of movements in interest rates is managed, where considered appropriate, through the use of fixed and floating rate
debt and interest rate swaps. 
Fair Value Estimates
The fair value of interest rate swaps is calculated as the present value of the estimated future cash flows.
The fair values of short-term deposits, loans and overdrafts with a maturity of less than one year are assumed to approximate to their 
book values. The fair value of long-term borrowings approximate to the carrying value reported in the balance sheet, as the majority 
are fixed rate borrowings and interest rate fluctuations have been minimal during the period.
Liquidity Risk
As regards liquidity, the policy of the Group has throughout the year been to maintain a mix of short and long-term borrowings with short
term flexibility achieved through overdraft facilities.
Credit Risk
The Group has no significant concentrations of credit risk. The Group has implemented policies that require appropriate credit checks on
potential residents before services commence.
3 Segmental Analysis
Revenue, earnings before taxation and total equity of the Group are wholly attributable to the operation of care homes and arise solely
within the United Kingdom. The Group is unable to analyse income statement items below Home EBITDA before central costs. The Group’s
financial reporting systems allow for the Balance Sheet to be prepared by legal entity only. Individual legal entities often have both
segments included, the financial reporting systems do not allow further analysis. As such, the Group is unable to analyse assets or
liabilities between the two operating segments.

Basic earnings per share is calculated by dividing the loss for the period attributable to ordinary equity holders of the parent, by the
weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the period.
Diluted earnings per share is calculated by dividing the loss for the period attributable to ordinary equity holders of the parent, by the
weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the period plus the weighted average number of ordinary shares that
would be issued on the conversion of all the dilutive potential ordinary shares into ordinary shares.
The following reflects the share data used in the basic and diluted earnings per share calculations and incorporates the impact of the

Impairment Test for Goodwill
Goodwill arising on acquisitions, as noted above, is not being amortised but tested annually for impairment.
For the purposes of this impairment review, goodwill is allocated to the Group’s two business segments. The recoverable amounts of these
cash generating units (CGUs) are determined based on value in use calculations. These cash flow projections are based on financial budgets
approved by management covering a ten-year period. Cash flows beyond the five-year period are extrapolated using the growth rates
stated below. The growth rates do not exceed the long-term average growth rate for sector in which the Group operates.
Key assumptions used for value in use calculations of both segments:
Growth rate 3%
Discount rate 9%
As at 2 October 2005 and 1 October 2006, no impairment charge to goodwill has been required.

Bank loans
The bank loans are secured by a fixed and floating charge over all of the assets of the Company and certain of its subsidiaries. Interest on
the bank loans is currently charged at a margin of 1.75% above LIBOR.
On 4 November 2005, the Group renegotiated its existing banking facility and increased its term loans by £38.7m as part of the funding 
for the acquisition of Ashbourne (see Note 29). Arrangement fees amounting to £1.2m were paid in relation to the bank loan finance and
were subsequently capitalised as part of the financial instruments. Throughout the year, the Group utilised its short-term development
facility to fund other acquisitions. On 12 July 2006, as part of the Company’s Initial Public Offering, the Company negotiated new banking
facilities and repaid all of its outstanding bank indebtedness from the proceeds of the public offering plus £67.2m of new bank loans
drawn. Unamortised arrangement fees of £3.1m, including fees paid as part of the financing for Ashbourne, were consequently charged 
to the profit and loss account as part of the redemption of bank loans on 12 July 2006.
Arrangement fees and professional costs amounting to £2.2m were paid in relation to the bank loan finance raised on 12 July 2006 and
have consequently been capitalised as part of the financial instruments at amortised cost. As at the year end, £0.2m of these fees had
been amortised and charged to the profit and loss account.
Of the total bank loans falling due within one year, £5.8m relates to term loans and £18.1m relates to short-term facilities drawn to fund
acquisitions.

23 Financial Instruments
Numerical financial instruments disclosures are set out below. Additional disclosures are set out in the accounting policies relating to risk
management.
In accordance with IAS 39, “Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement”, management has reviewed contracts for embedded
derivatives that are required to be separately accounted for if they do not meet certain requirements set out in the standard. No such
embedded derivatives were found.
Financial Instruments
The Group’s financial instruments, other than derivatives, comprise borrowings, cash and liquid resources and various items such as trade
receivables and trade payables, that arise directly from its operations. The main purpose of these financial instruments is to manage the
finance for the Group’s operations. The Group also enters into derivative transactions (principally interest rate swaps). The purpose of such
transactions is to manage the interest rate risks arising from the Group’s operations and its sources of finance.
It is, and has been throughout the period under review, the Group’s policy that no trading in financial instruments shall be undertaken. 
The main risks arising from the Group’s financial instruments are interest rate risk and liquidity risk. The Board reviews and agrees policies
for managing each of these risks and they are summarised below. These policies remained unchanged throughout the periods presented.
Interest Rate Risk
The Group finances its operations through a mixture of retained profits and bank borrowings. The Group borrows in sterling at both fixed
and floating rates of interest and then uses interest rate swaps to manage the Group’s exposure to interest rate fluctuations.
Liquidity Rate Risk
As regards liquidity, the Group’s policy throughout the periods presented has been to maintain a mix of short, medium and long-term
borrowings with a number of banks and institutions. Short-term flexibility is achieved by overdraft facilities. It is, in addition, the Group’s
policy to maintain borrowing facilities with a syndicate of banks.
Currency Risks
The Group is based in the United Kingdom, with its operations entirely within the United Kingdom. It does not hold any investment in
overseas operations and consequently the balance sheet is not exposed to movements in currency exchange rates. The Group does not
have sales or purchase transactions in currencies other than the unit’s functional currency and consequently does not have transactional
currency exposures.

Interest rate swap contracts have been marked to market to produce fair value figures. All other fair values shown above have been
calculated by discounting cash flows at prevailing interest rates. For floating rate bank loans, fair values closely approximate to book values.
The fair value of short-term loans and overdrafts approximate to the fair carrying value because of the short maturity of these instruments.
The fair value of long-term borrowings approximate to the carrying value reported in the balance sheet as the majority are floating rate.
Gains and Losses on Hedges
The Group enters into interest rate swaps to manage its interest rate exposure. Currently the Group does not apply hedge accounting.
24  Deferred Tax
Deferred tax is calculated in full on temporary differences under the liability method using a tax rate of 30% (2005 – 30%)

Deferred tax assets have been recognised in respect of all tax losses and other temporary differences giving rise to deferred tax assets
where it is probable that these assets will be recovered. Deferred tax assets of £8.4m (2005 – £0.0m) were not recognised in respect 
of losses that can be carried forward against future taxable income.
The movements in deferred tax assets and liabilities (prior to the offsetting of balances within the same jurisdiction as permitted by IAS12)

Operating lease rentals
General practice, under UK GAAP , has been for operating lease rentals to be charged, as an expense, in accordance with the contractual
payments made under the lease. IFRS requires the minimum guaranteed lease payments made under operating leases to be recognised,
as an expense, on a straight-line basis over the lease term, even if the payments are not made on such a basis. 
Consequently, rental charges included in the income statement have increased by £30.7m and £4.0m in the periods to 1 October 2006 
and 2 October 2005, respectively. Related deferred tax assets of £9.3m and £1.2m have been recognised in the Group balance sheets 
as at 1 October 2006 and 2 October 2005.
Goodwill amortisation
Under UK GAAP , the Group amortises goodwill over its estimated useful economic life of 20 years. IFRS 3 requires that goodwill is not
amortised but is subject to an annual impairment review instead. As required by IFRS 1 an impairment test was carried out on the date of
transition to IFRS and annually thereafter. No impairment was recognised and no other adjustments to the carrying value of goodwill were
made. Goodwill amortisation charged under UK GAAP , totalling £8.9m and £3.1m in the periods to 1 October 2006 and 2 October 2005,
respectively, have been reversed. Notes to the IFRS Financial Information
For the 52 weeks ended 1 October 2006
37 Reconciliation of Net Assets and Profit under UK GAAP to IFRS
continued
Business Combinations
IFRS requires that the cost of investment is allocated to the acquired entity’s assets and liabilities and contingent liabilities assumed based
on fair values to the acquirer at the date of acquisition. IFRS prescribes the allocation of the excess consideration to more categories of
intangible assets (such as resident contracts) with goodwill being a residual asset. Intangible assets associated with resident’s contracts
totalling £4.9m have been recognised upon the acquisition of Southern Cross Equityco Limited.
Amortisation on resident contracts totalling £1.6m and £0.9m has been recognised as an expense, for the periods to 1 October 2006 
and 2 October 2005, respectively.
Financial Instruments
Under UK GAAP , gains and losses from derivative financial instruments used for hedging purposes are not recognised in earnings or as
adjustments to carrying amounts until the underlying hedged transaction matures or occurs. IAS 39 requires all derivatives to be recognised
at fair value in the balance sheet. Consequently, interest rate swaps with a negative fair value of £Nil and £3.9m have been recognised 
in the Group balance sheets at 1 October 2006 and 2 October 2005 respectively. Related deferred tax assets of £Nil and £1.2m have been
recognised in the Group balance sheets.

Independent Auditors’ Report to the Members
of Southern Cross Healthcare Group PLC
We have audited the parent company financial statements of Southern Cross Healthcare Group PLC for the 52 week period ended 1 October
2006 which comprise the Company balance sheet and the related notes. These parent company financial statements have been prepared under
the accounting policies set out therein. We have also audited the information in the remuneration report that is described as having been audited.
We have reported separately on the Group financial statements of Southern Cross Healthcare Group PLC for the year ended 1 October 2006.
Respective Responsibilities of Directors and Auditors
The Directors’ responsibilities for preparing the Annual Report, the remuneration report and the parent company financial statements in
accordance with applicable law and United Kingdom Accounting Standards (United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice) are
set out in the statement of directors’ responsibilities.
Our responsibility is to audit the parent company financial statements and the part of the Directors’ remuneration report to be audited in
accordance with relevant legal and regulatory requirements and International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland). This report, including
the opinion, has been prepared for and only for the Company’s members as a body in accordance with Section 235 of the Companies Act
1985 and for no other purpose. We do not, in giving this opinion, accept or assume responsibility for any other purpose or to any other
person to whom this report is shown or into whose hands it may come save where expressly agreed by our prior consent in writing.
We report to you our opinion as to whether the parent company financial statements give a true and fair view and whether the parent
company financial statements and the part of the remuneration report to be audited have been properly prepared in accordance with the
Companies Act 1985. We report to you whether in our opinion the information given in the Directors’ report is consistent with the parent
company financial statements. The information given in the Directors’ Report includes that specific information presented in the business
review and the financial review that is cross referred from the business review section of the Directors’ report. We also report to you if, in
our opinion, the Company has not kept proper accounting records, if we have not received all the information and explanations we require
for our audit, or if information specified by law regarding Directors’ remuneration and other transactions is not disclosed.
We read other information contained in the Annual Report and consider whether it is consistent with the audited parent company financial
statements. The other information comprises only the Directors’ Report, the unaudited part of the remuneration report, the Chairman’s
statement and the business review and the financial review. We consider the implications for our report if we become aware of any
apparent misstatements or material inconsistencies with the parent company financial statements. Our responsibilities do not extend to
any other information.
Basis of Audit Opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland) issued by the Auditing Practices Board. 
An audit includes examination, on a test basis, of evidence relevant to the amounts and disclosures in the parent company financial
statements and the part of the remuneration report to be audited. It also includes an assessment of the significant estimates and
judgements made by the Directors in the preparation of the parent company financial statements, and of whether the accounting policies
are appropriate to the Company’s circumstances, consistently applied and adequately disclosed.
We planned and performed our audit so as to obtain all the information and explanations which we considered necessary in order to
provide us with sufficient evidence to give reasonable assurance that the parent company financial statements and the part of the
remuneration report to be audited are free from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or other irregularity or error. In forming
our opinion we also evaluated the overall adequacy of the presentation of information in the parent company financial statements and the
part of the remuneration report to be audited.
Opinion
In our opinion:
l the parent company financial statements give a true and fair view, in accordance with United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting
Practice, of the state of the Company’s affairs as at 1 October 2006;
l the parent company financial statements and the part of the remuneration report to be audited have been properly prepared in
accordance with the Companies Act 1985; and
l the information given in the Directors’ report is consistent with the parent company financial statements.

Statement of Accounting Policies
Basis of Preparation
The financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention and in accordance with applicable UK accounting
standards and comply with the Companies Act 1985. No profit and loss account has been presented for the Company as permitted 
by Section 230 Companies Act 1985.
The Company is included in the financial statements of Southern Cross Healthcare Group , which are publicly available. Consequently 
the Company has taken advantage of the exemption from preparing a cash flow statement under the terms of FRS1 “Cash Flow
Statements (Revised 1996)”. The Company is also exempt under the terms of FRS8 “Related Party Transactions” from disclosing related
party transactions with entities that are part of the same group.
Turnover
Turnover represents fees charged (excluding VAT) by the Group for services provided relating to its principal activities. Turnover is recognised
when the services are provided in full.
Fixed Asset Investments
Fixed asset investments are included at cost, less amounts written off in respect of diminution in value.
Deferred Taxation
The Group accounts for taxation, which is deferred or accelerated by reason of timing differences which have originated but not reversed
by the balance sheet date. Deferred tax assets are only recognised to the extent that they are considered recoverable against future
taxable profits. Deferred tax is measured at the average tax rates that are expected to apply in the periods in which the timing differences
are expected to reverse. Deferred tax liabilities and assets are not discounted.
Finance Costs
Finance costs are charged to the profit and loss account over the term of the debt so that the amount charged is at a constant rate on the
carrying amount. Finance costs include issue costs, which are initially recognised as a reduction in the proceeds of the associated capital
instrument.
Financial Instruments and Derivatives
The Group’s accounting policy for derivatives is to defer and only recognise in the Group profit and loss account gains and losses on hedges
of revenues, operating payments and capital expenditure to match the underlying transactions.
Interest rate cap agreements taken out are recorded at cost in the balance sheet and amortised over the period of the agreements.
Amounts payable or receivable in respect of interest rate cap agreements are recognised in the net interest payable charge on an 
accruals basis.
Debt Instruments
Debt instruments are stated at the amount of net proceeds adjusted to amortise the issue cost of debt evenly over the term of the debt. 84 Southern Cross Healthcare Group PLC   Annual Report and Accounts 2006

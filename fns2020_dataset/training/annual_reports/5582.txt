Epistem Holdings Plc
Annual Report 2012
The Contract Research Services division 
provides pre-clinical efficacy testing, advanced 
immunohistochemistry services and cell biology 
expertise in the areas of oncology, oncology 
supportive care (mucositis), inflammatory bowel 
disease and dermatology.
Despite challenging market 
conditions, Contract Research 
Services delivered a 27% operating 
margin on sales of £2.9m. 
Investment in research  
and development
The division continues to expand 
and strengthen its investment in 
new model development. During the 
year, model development continued 
with the advance of our rheumatoid 
arthritis models, which we anticipate 
launching in the next financial 
period. Our oncology model 
portfolio has also been extended 
with the introduction of our imaging 
capabilities, especially in leukaemia, 
along with further investment in our 
inflammatory bowel disease models.
Biodefence
The division continued to develop  
its collaboration with the US 
National Institutes of Health 
biodefence programme and our 
status as ‘Subject Matter Experts’ 
(SME) in radiation treatment.  
The programme yielded a  
notable advance in the treatment  
of mucositis, (the debilitating 
condition caused by chemotherapy 
and radiation treatment) with the 
recognised pre-clinical efficacy 
evidence of low cost antibiotic 
treatments. The collaboration is 
anticipated to develop further in the 
coming financial period buoyed by 
our investment in new equipment 
and facilities. During the year the 
division took delivery of a new GLP 
compliant state of the art irradiation 
system and also received funding 
from the US biodefence consortium 
for a new image analysis system. 
Outlook
The increased investment in new 
models is expected to strengthen 
the growth prospects of our 
Pre-clinical Research Services.  
We continue to invest in building  
key customer relationships as well 
as strengthening the expertise of 
our scientific base.

mutations enables patients to be 
stratified for their own ‘personalised’ 
course of therapeutic treatment. 
Alongside these markers, we are 
beginning to develop a suite of new 
pharmacogenomic tests using 
our Genedrive
™
 platform, primarily 
in the disease area of oncology.

Case Study
Gaining 
regulatory 
approval in India
According to the World 
Health Organisation, in 
2010 globally there were 
8.8 million incident cases 
of TB. India accounted 
for approximately 25% 
of the global TB burden 
with approximately 30 
million TB diagnostic tests 
undertaken per annum. 
Annually over US$1 billion 
is spent worldwide on TB 
diagnostics, a figure over 
twice as large as the current 
market for TB drugs.
We are currently progressing 
the clinical assessment of 
our initial TB test with the 
Indian regulatory authorities.

Epistem Holdings Plc
Annual Report 2012
New product registration
During the year, the Company 
successfully registered its 
Genedrive
™
 platform (CE mark) and 
its first diagnostic tuberculosis (TB) 
assay (CE-IVD). These registrations 
will enable the Company to 
commence a new phase of product 
led revenue growth. Molecular 
(DNA) analysis remains the gold 
standard for disease diagnostic 
testing globally and the novelty of 
Genedrive
™
 lies in its ability to bring 
molecular analysis to a near patient 
setting at low cost and with industry 
leading ‘speed to result’.
New relationships
During the year the Company 
announced global supply and 
distribution collaborations in TB  
with Becton Dickinson in the US 
and Xcelris Laboratories in India. 
These collaborations include 
escalating volume requirements 
with each contract capable of 
delivering revenues to Epistem  
in excess of US$20m-US$30m  
over the next 3-5 years.
Tuberculosis
TB is a highly damaging  
infectious disease. The World 
Health Organisation (WHO) has 
identified tuberculosis as a “Global 
health issue” and ranks it in their 
high priority disease areas for 
improved world health diagnosis 
and treatment. Over the coming 
years we will work closely with the 
WHO to gain accreditation for our 
initial TB test. The major strategy 
to tackle this disease remains 
early diagnosis and drug treatment 
to interrupt TB transmission. 
Test menu development
Beyond our initial TB development 
in infectious disease we are now 
beginning to broaden our range  
of infectious disease tests in the 
areas of malaria, dengue, HIV, 
HCV and sexually transmitted 
diseases. 
Government agencies
Alongside infectious diseases, 
we are working closely with the 
US Government on a number  
of programmes to identify 
bio-threats and infectious 
diseases in military settings. 
Genedrive
™
 is a novel, disruptive and highly sensitive molecular 
diagnostic tool with the capability of providing near patient 
testing at low cost with rapid results across a broad spectrum  
of disease areas.

Epistem Holdings Plc
Annual Report 2012
The Novel Therapies division is discovering the 
body’s own key regulators of epithelial stem 
cells and tissues. Based on our highly sensitive 
molecular techniques and core cell biology 
expertise, we discover and develop our own 
novel drug agents.
Epistem scientists have 
comprehensively profiled gene 
expression patterns in epithelial 
tissue to identify key regulators  
of proliferation, differentiation, 
apoptosis and self-renewal. These 
key regulators are responsible for 
restoring damaged tissue and for 
maintaining life-long tissue renewal.
Investment in technology
During the period, the division 
focused on protein synthesis of  
its prioritised leads and we are  
now beginning to enter the early 
stages of pre-clinical efficacy 
testing. At the conclusion of this 
process, we shall be better able  
to demonstrate the technical and 
commercial strength of our leads.
Partnerships
The division’s commercial  
strategy includes working with 
collaborative partners based around 
licensing, milestones and royalties, 
commensurate with pre-clinical  
and clinical drug development. 
During the year our body of 
pre-clinical development data 
continued to progress and we 
maintained close contact with  
the leading big pharma groups  
to evaluate our drug discovery  
and development opportunities.
Outlook
The division will continue to 
progress its identification and 
understanding of the body’s key 
regulators. The timing of future 
collaboration agreements remains 
difficult to predict but we remain 
confident in our development 
programme and the prospect of 
future licences and funding support.

Epistem Holdings Plc
Annual Report 2012
I am pleased to report major progress in a 
number of the Company’s core development 
programmes and the acceleration of 
investment in our first diagnostic product in 
the results for the year ended 30 June 2012. 
I am also pleased to report the  
recent completion of the first high 
value commercial contract for our 
Genedrive
™
 platform with Becton 
Dickinson. This agreement coupled 
with the earlier reported Xcelris 
Laboratories agreement signals  
the beginning of a new and  
exciting phase of revenue growth 
for Epistem and its investors.
Whilst market and trading 
conditions remain volatile across 
the healthcare sector, Epistem 
continues to differentiate itself 
through its diversified business 
model and advancing technologies 
whilst delivering increasing  
investor returns. 
Results 
Further details of the results for  
the period are covered in the Chief 
Executive Officer’s review, but 
financially the year to 30 June 2012 
saw the Company deliver revenues 
of £5.6m (2011: £5.8m). Based on 
this trading performance and the 
high levels of investment made in  
our Novel Therapies and Diagnostics 
(Genedrive
™
) programmes, the 
Company moved from a prior year 
profit to reporting an after tax loss of 
£0.2m (2011: £0.4m profit after tax). 
Following the successful completion 
of the £2.7m cash placing in 
December 2011, cash reserves at 
the end of the period were £4.7m 
(2011: £3.6m). 
During the year the Company 
continued to make progress  
across each of its three divisions  
as outlined below: 
•	 Following significant revenue 
growth over the past few years, 
Contract Research Services 
revenues were steady in the  
year at £2.9m (2011: £3.0m).  
We continue to develop and 
extend our high margin service 
offerings alongside our 
cornerstone US government 
biodefence contract. 
 With market uncertainties 
persisting, the division continues 
to build on and extend its core 
scientific strengths to provide a 
solid platform for future growth. 
•	 Personalised Medicine revenue 
growth increased significantly  
up to £2.7m (2011: £1.1m), more 
than double last year’s revenue, 
largely driven by the Sanofi-
Aventis oncology and GSK 
fibrosis biomarker collaborations.  
The Personalised Medicine 
reported revenues for the year 
also included initial Genedrive
™
 
unit sales (development) of £0.4m 
(2011: £0.0m).
•	 The progress of our Genedrive
™
 
molecular diagnostic device, the 
recent EU regulatory approval 
and the announcement of major 
collaborations with Becton 
Dickinson (outside India and the 
Indian Sub Continent) and Xcelris 
Laboratories (India and Indian 
Sub Continent) in Tuberculosis 
marks the beginning of Epistem’s 
Non-executive Chairman’s Statement
David Evans
Business Review 15
Epistem Holdings Plc
Annual Report 2012
first product related revenues and 
heralds a radical change in ‘Point 
of Care’ diagnostics healthcare. 
The Board believes Genedrive
™
  
is poised to bring about a 
breakthrough in rapid, high 
sensitivity and low cost molecular 
(DNA) diagnostic testing ‘near to 
the patient’ across a broad range 
of disease areas. 
•	 Novel Therapies’s drug 
development programme 
continues to advance. Following 
the completion of the funded 
research phase of the Novartis 
collaboration in 2011, we have 
invested in the development of our 
emerging leads with the division 
reporting nil revenues for the year 
(2011: £1.6m). Collaborative 
discussions are being progressed 
with potential partners in the 
areas of Regenerative Medicine 
and Oncology. The timings of 
license opportunities and future 
development funding remains 
difficult to predict accurately. 
•	 Based on the ongoing investment 
in our Novel Therapies and 
Genedrive
™
 programmes, the 
Company now reports a loss for 
the year of £0.2m (2011: £0.4m 
profit for the year) and loss per 
share of 2.9p (2011: 4.9p earnings 
per share).
Outlook
Epistem continues to build on its 
scientific and technical heritage  
as it transforms into a diverse, 
technology leading personalised 
medicine group with the near term 
growth in product revenues which 
are now underpinned by our first 
significant and long term commercial 
contracts with world class partners. 
Against a backdrop of market 
uncertainty, Epistem remains vigilant, 
whilst increasingly positive about  
its future growth potential.
Despite the challenging market 
conditions, each division continues 
to strengthen its technology and 
expertise. The Personalised Medicine 
division has seen a significant 
improvement in Biomarker growth 
over the past year, which together 
with our rapidly advancing molecular 
diagnostic platform Genedrive
™
  
is expected to deliver accelerated 
revenue growth across the division in 
future years. The Contract Research 
Services division continues to build 
an international profile and reputation 
for its proprietary service models  
and enhance its relationship with  
the NIH under our US biodefence 
contract (3 years remaining of this  
5 year contract). We anticipate a 
return to modest growth from this 
division in the current financial year. 
The Novel Therapies funded element 
of the drug discovery collaboration 
with Novartis was completed in 2011 
and we continue to maintain our 
investment in the development of  
our identified hits/leads. Whilst the 
timing of license and development 
opportunities remains difficult  
to judge, we remain optimistic  
about the strength of our hit/lead 
programme. We are in discussions 
with a number of other collaborative 
partners in relation to the 
development of our regenerative 
medicine and oncology hits/lead 
portfolio. Epistem continues to  
refine its discovery and development 
technology to position itself as  
a world leader in therapeutic 
discovery in the field of epithelial 
stem cell regulation. 
Alongside continued strengthening 
of our divisional units and the 
commercial advance of our 
Genedrive
™
 molecular diagnostic 
product, we expect to see the 
Company significantly strengthen  
its financial performance over the 
coming year. 
I would like to thank the CEO for his 
support and leadership, the Board 
and our employees for their effort 
and commitment in driving Epistem’s 
progress over the past year, as well 
as our investors whose on-going 
support has provided a stable 
platform for our continued growth. 
On behalf of the Board, I would  
also like to offer our thoughts  
and condolences to the family  
of Professor Chris Potten who  
died recently. Chris was a world-
renowned scientist who pioneered 
stem cell research in Manchester 
and was regarded as one of  
the world’s most influential figures  
in his field. In 2000, he co-founded 
Epistem and we look forward to 
maintaining and developing the 
legacy that Chris created.

were underpinned by the Contract 
Research Services division, which 
delivered sales of £2.9m (2011: 
£3.0m). The Personalised Medicine 
division saw sales increase to 
£2.7m (2011: £1.1m), with the  
Novel Therapies division reporting  
no sales over the period, £0.0m 
(2011: £1.6m). 
Consolidated territory revenues 
were split US 68% (2011: 68%),

Contract Research Services sales  17
Epistem Holdings Plc
Annual Report 2012
delivered a slightly reduced year- 
on-year operating profit of £0.8m 
(2011 £1.0m). Operating profits  
were further bolstered by growth in 
Personalised Medicine sales, which 
saw the division deliver a step up in 
its operating profit to £0.4m (2011: 
£0.1m) over the year. With Novel 
Therapies investment in its lead 
development reporting an operating 
loss of £0.8m (2011: operating profit 
£0.6m) and central administration 
costs largely unchanged over the 
year at £1.3m (2011: £1.3m) this 
gave rise to an overall group 
operating loss for the year of 
(£0.8m) (2011: operating profit 
£0.4m). 
With the benefit of a £0.5m deferred 
tax credit, the Group reported loss 
after tax for the year was £0.2m 
(2011: profit £0.4m) with year end 
headcount in the Company at 63 
(2011: 55).
Cash balances following the 
completion of the £2.7m cash 
placing in December 2011 were 
£4.7m (2011: £3.6m). 
Reported loss per share was 2.9p 
(2011: Earnings per share 4.9p). 
Clear investor communication  
of the Company’s strategy and 
performance remains a key  
element of our success and we will 
continue to advance our investor 
communications as we embark 
upon the next phase of growth. 
The Company’s annual audit will  
be completed in October 2012 by 
HW Chartered Accountants and 
their audit report will be included  
in the annual accounts which  
are expected to be distributed  
to shareholders shortly.
Operating review
Contract Research Services
Contract Research Services 
delivered a marginally reduced 
year-on-year revenue performance, 
whilst producing a respectable 27% 
operating margin (£0.8m operating 
profit). Although market and industry 
conditions remain challenging, we 
continue to deliver a high margin, 
niche, pre-clinical service offering 
across our core disease areas of 
oncology, mucositis, inflammatory 
bowel disease and dermatology. 
Over the period, we continued to 
develop and extend our specialist 
service offering in the area of 
oncology (new imaging models)  
and advanced inflammation 
(rheumatoid arthritis) models.
As part of our ongoing collaboration 
with the US National Institutes of 
Health’s biodefence programme,  
we continue to expand our role  
as ‘Subject Matter Experts’ (SME)  
in radiation treatment and have 
recently taken receipt of a new GLP 
compliant state of the art irradiation 
and image analysis system funded 
by the US biodefence consortium. 
The US government remains 
committed to targeting treatment  
of radiation sickness following a 
nuclear incident/event. 
The new financial year promises  
to build on last year with the advent 
of new product developments  
in oncology (imaging), hair 
immunohistochemistry and 
advanced inflammation models 
from which we anticipate a return  
to modest growth.
Personalised  
Medicine Biomarker
Over the year, the Biomarker division 
enjoyed a strong uplift in revenue 
performance to £2.3m (2011: £1.1m) 
driven by the first full year of the 
Sanofi-Aventis collaboration  
and the commencement of the 
recently announced GSK fibrosis 
collaboration. Both collaborations 
utilise Epistem’s proprietary RNA 
amplification technology and 
oncology bioinformatics to provide 
biomarker discovery and translational 
support across the Sanofi-Aventis 
oncology drug development and 
GSK fibrosis drug discovery 
programmes. The Biomarker division 
works with major pharmaceutical 
and biotech business groups by 
providing a suite of pre-clinical and 
clinical pharmacodynamic models  
to measure the effect of a drug on 
targeted tissue (gene activated 
pathways). With the advance of the 
pharmaceutical industry focus on 
‘personalised medicine’ we have  
also linked the development of  
our Genedrive
™
 platform to our  18
Epistem Holdings Plc
Annual Report 2012
Biomarker group to help identify key 
mutational oncology targets such as 
KRAS, JAK2 and EGFR in cancerous 
tissue. The identification of these 
target mutations will enable patients 
to be ‘stratified’ for the correct 
course of ‘personalised’ therapeutic 
treatment. Over the coming year we 
will also accelerate our developments 
in circulating (blood) tumour cells by 
developing Genedrive
™
 for use as  
a highly sensitive screening tool to 
identify the presence of mutation 
targets in blood. 
Diagnostics
Following our first EU product 
registration for the Genedrive
™
  
unit (CE mark) and Tuberculosis 
assay (CE-IVD) and the recent 
announcements of the Becton 
Dickinson and Xcelris Laboratories 
collaborations in Tuberculosis,  
we now believe we are at the 
beginning of a new phase of 
product led revenue growth for 
Epistem. Both these commercial 
collaborations (supply and 
distribution arrangements in 
Tuberculosis) include escalating 
annual volume requirements for 
units and assays with our partners, 
with each contract capable of 
delivering revenues to Epistem  
in excess of US$20-30m per  
annum over the next 3-5 years. 
Tuberculosis represents a 
significant revenue prospect  
and initial opportunity for our 
Genedrive
™
 platform, lending itself 
to use both inside and outside  
the laboratory setting and hence 
enabling ‘near patient’ testing or 
testing in remote field locations.  
The Genedrive
™
 platform is 
expected to be capable of testing  
a wide range of infectious diseases 
with new tests under development 
including malaria, dengue, HIV, HCV 
and a range of sexually transmitted 
diseases. We expect to supply and 
distribute these high volume tests 
through a channel partner strategy. 
We are receiving strong interest  
and demand for the use and 
development of Genedrive
™
  
and we will be working closely  
with the World Health Organisation 
and other high profile Healthcare 
Foundations including both the 
Gates and Clinton Foundations  
to ensure that we position our 
Tuberculosis test to best diagnostic 
and therapeutic effect in the global 
market. Over the coming months  
we will be publishing our first  
clinical data on our Tuberculosis 
test and how this compares with 
other tests in the market and 
anticipate launching our first 
regulated product into the US$1bn 
Tuberculosis diagnostics market 
early in 2013. 
Alongside healthcare applications, 
we have also seen significant 
interest in the use of Genedrive
™
  
for biosurveillance and forensics 
targets. We are working closely with 
the US government on a number of 
programmes to identify biothreats 
and infectious diseases in military 
settings. A good example of this  
is the recent completion of the  
US Government contract with the 
Defence Threat Reduction Agency 
for next generation ‘remote settings’ 
diagnostics. This will provide 
Epistem with up to US$2.0m  
in staged funding over the next  
24 months. We anticipate further 
growth in the US Department of 
Defence areas over the coming 
year. In the UK, we continue to 
progress the National Police 
Improvements Agency (NPIA) 
programme to enable crime scene 
testing for DNA fingerprinting. 
Genedrive
™
 is a novel, disruptive 
and highly sensitive molecular 
diagnostic tool with the capability  
of targeting a near patient, low cost 
and rapid turnaround diagnosis 
(~30-60mins including sample 
preparation) across a broad 
spectrum of bacterial, viral, fungal 
and somatic mutational disease 
areas. We expect to see molecular 
diagnostics begin to dominate  
the next generation of diagnostic 
testing and to change the speed, 
accuracy and workflows in near 
patient ‘Point of Care’ diagnostic 
assessment. Over the coming year, 
we intend to accelerate our product 
developments through increased 
investment in our manpower 
resource and expertise, enhance 
our manufacturing and regulatory 
control and further develop our 
channel partner distribution strategy. 
The increased growth in 
Personalised Medicine revenues 
enabled the division to lift its 
operating profit over the year.  
We anticipate further growth in our 
portfolio of personalised medicine 
technologies driven by increasing 
medical focus for effective patient 
treatment, tighter regulatory 
requirements and the growing 
industry need for rapid, low cost 
and sensitive molecular diagnostic 
tools. Our proprietary technologies 
are well positioned to capitalise  
on this market growth.
Novel Therapies
The Novel Therapies collaboration 
with Novartis completed its funding 
phase in 2011 and we have continued 
to invest in the development of  
our prioritised novel hits/leads over 
the past year. With the Novartis 
collaboration expected to complete  
in 2013, we retain intellectual property 
rights over our collaborative leads 
and continue to progress discussions 
with Novartis and other groups 
around the development of our  
Novel Therapies lead programme. 
The timing of a license opportunity 
and/or funding support remains 
difficult to judge although we remain 
confident in our development 
programme and the prospect of 
future licenses and funding support. 
Chief Executive’s Review (continued)
Business Review 19
Epistem Holdings Plc
Annual Report 2012
Following protein synthesis of our 
prioritised hits/leads, we are now 
beginning to enter the early stages 
of pre-clinical efficacy testing.  
Over the coming months we will 
better establish our leads’ effect  
on the cell biology and signalling 
pathways which regulate the  
cell/stem cells in the areas of 
regenerative medicine and 
oncology. We are also considering 
small molecule partnerships to 
establish a portfolio of agents  
which regulate signalling pathways 
and cell biology. 
We will evaluate our other drug 
discovery and development 
opportunities with major industry 
players to identify new lead 
developments and to expand  
our discovery and early stage 
development platform. 
Current trading and outlook
We continue to develop a rich 
portfolio of technology and business 
opportunities to enable us to grow 
and invest in our future growth.  
We are continuing to build and 
strengthen our internal expertise 
across our core divisional 
programmes and this careful 
preparation is expected to deliver 
growth over the coming year.  
Our traditional business model of 
services and technology licensing 
continues to evolve with the advent 
of our new product revenues.  
We believe that the new product 
launches will continue to de-risk  
our business model and allow us 
to strengthen our trading position 
and increase the confidence of our 
future revenue forecasts. 
We continue to staff our 
management team with world class, 
innovative individuals who fit with 
the culture and dynamism of the 
Company. We also expect to build 
on our corporate and board strength 
and supplement our scientific 
advisory board and advisory 
committees as appropriate to reflect 
the changing nature of our business.
Our shareholder interest and 
support remains strong and we will 
ensure that our ongoing investor 
communications continue to nurture 
this relationship. 
We anticipate a strengthening 
operational and financial position  
for the year ahead based on our 
expectation of revenue growth  
and our overall growth plans. We 
remain selective in considering 
complementary technology, 
acquisitions and in-licensing,  
with few opportunities thus far 
meeting our high expectations. 
We remain firmly fixed on building 
shareholder value by providing a 
high margin, diverse and rapidly 
growing portfolio of world class 
technologies. 
I would like to thank the Board, 
management and employees for 
their help and support over the past 
year. I would also like to thank our 
investors for their continued support 
and interest in our technology and 
the Company as a whole. 
On behalf of the all the Board, 
management and staff at Epistem,  
I would also like to send our 
condolences to the family of 
Professor Chris Potten who died  
in August. Chris was a world-
renowned scientist who pioneered 
stem cell research in Manchester, 
UK. Chris led a team of researchers 
at the Paterson Institute at The 
Christie Hospital Manchester for 
more than 30 years. He was 
regarded as one of the world’s  
most influential figures in his field 
and developed research which  
is now central to many areas of 
cancer therapy. He published 
around 400 scientific papers and  
11 books – ensuring a reference 
legacy that will be used for many 
years to come. In 2000, he co-
founded Epistem with Cath Booth 
and his team. Chris will be sadly 
missed, but we look forward to 
maintaining and developing the 
legacy that Chris created.

Statement of Directors’ responsibilities
The Directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report, the Directors’ Remuneration Report and the financial statements in 
accordance with applicable law and regulations.
Company law requires the Directors to prepare financial statements for each financial year. Under that law The Directors have prepared 
the Group financial statements in accordance with International Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the European Union.
In preparing those financial statements, the Directors are required to:
•	 Select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently;
•	 Make suitable judgements and estimates that are reasonable and prudent;
•	 State that the financial statements comply with IFRSs as adopted by the European Union, subject to any material departures  
being adequately disclosed and explained;
•	 Prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis unless it is inappropriate to presume that the Group will continue  
in business.
The Directors confirm that they have complied with the above requirements in preparing the financial statements.
The Directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting records that are sufficient to show and explain the Company’s 
transactions and disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position of the Group and enable them to ensure that the 
financial statements comply with the Companies Act 2006 and Article 4 of the IAS Regulation. They are also responsible for safeguarding 
the assets of the Group and hence for taking reasonable steps for the prevention and detection of fraud and other irregularities.
The Directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity of the corporate and financial information included on the Company’s 
website. Legislation in the United Kingdom governing the preparation and dissemination of financial statements may differ from legislation 
in other jurisdictions.
Principal risks
The Board meets regularly to review operations and to discuss risk areas. The Review of the Year on pages 2 to 19 report on the factors 
which are key to the on-going development of the Company. The Corporate Governance Report contains details of the Group’s system 
of internal control. Details of the financial risks are disclosed in Note 18 to the financial statements. The Directors regularly assess and 
monitor the business risks faced by the Group. Risk is an inherent feature of business and set out below are some key risks, together 
with associated mitigating factors. This list does not purport to be exhaustive.
Development risk
The Group undertakes significant activity with the aim of launching new products, therapies and services. There can be no  
guarantee that the development activity will enable the programmes to meet the technical and intellectual property hurdles required  
for a commercial launch to be undertaken. The Group seeks to mitigate this risk by ensuring that development programmes are planned 
and undertaken by staff with the requisite skills. The Group monitors industry trends and customer needs to ensure that its development 
targets remain relevant.
Regulatory risk
There can be no guarantee that the Group’s products or services will be able to obtain or maintain the necessary approval for the  
orderly conduct of its business. Approvals can require evaluation of data relating to safety, quality and efficacy standards. The Group 
seeks to mitigate regulatory risk by conducting its operations within recognised quality assurance standards and by undergoing  
external assessment.
Management and employees
The Group’s future success is dependent on its management team and staff. There is an on-going risk that staff will leave to join 
competitor companies. The Group seeks to mitigate this risk by establishing effective management organisation and leading staff 
incentive schemes.
Economic risk
The Group’s programmes are targeted to meet the commercial requirements of its clients. In the current economic climate, clients’ plans 
may be subject to changes which may adversely affect the financial performance of the Group. The Group seeks to mitigate this risk by 
operating a diversified business model across various technologies and territories. 24

Governance
Corporate Governance Report
For the year ended 30 June 2012
The Group is subject to the continuing requirements of the AIM Rules and is committed to adhering to corporate governance  
standards appropriate for a company of its size. The Group follows the Quoted Companies Alliance guidelines and has Remuneration, 
Audit and Nomination committees with written terms of reference and a schedule of matters reserved for the Board, which generally 
meets each month.
The Board has established an Audit Committee, a Remuneration Committee and a Nomination Committee. The membership of these 
committees and attendance at meetings is as follows:
Audit  
Committee
Remuneration  
Committee
Nominations 
Committee
David Evans (Non-executive Chairman) 3 3 1
Robert Nolan (Non-executive Director) 3 3 1
Roger Lloyd (Non-executive Director), Remuneration/Nominations Committees only – 3 1
Remuneration Committee
The Remuneration Committee reviews the scale and structure of the Executive Directors’ and senior management’s remuneration and 
the terms of their service contracts. The remuneration and terms of appointment of the Non-executive Directors are set by the Board. 
The Remuneration Committee also approves the issue of share options under schemes approved by the Board.
None of the Committee members have any personal financial interest (other than as shareholders), conflicts of interest arising from 
cross-directorships, or day-to-day involvement in the running of the business. No Director plays a part in any discussion about his  
or her own remuneration.
Audit Committee
The Audit Committee has responsibility for receiving accounts and reviewing reports from the management and the Company’s auditors, 
relating to Annual and Interim Accounts and the accounting and internal controls in place throughout the Group. At this stage of the 
Group’s size and development the Committee has decided that an internal audit function is not required as the Group’s internal controls 
system in place is appropriate for its size. The Audit Committee met three times during the year.
Nomination Committee
The Nomination Committee has responsibility for reviewing the size, structure and composition of the Board, as well as retirements  
and appointments of replacement and additional Directors, and for making appropriate recommendations to the Board.
Relations with shareholders
The Group recognises the importance of communicating with its shareholders to ensure that its strategy and performance is understood 
and that it remains accountable to shareholders. The Board as a whole is responsible for ensuring that a satisfactory dialogue with 
shareholders takes place, while the Chairman and Chief Executive ensure that the views of the shareholders are communicated to the 
Board as a whole. The Board ensures that the Group’s strategic plans have been carefully reviewed in terms of their ability to deliver 
long-term shareholder value. 
Internal controls
The Board acknowledges its responsibility for establishing and maintaining the Group’s system of internal controls and will continue  
to ensure that management keeps these processes under regular review and improves them where appropriate. The system of internal 
controls is designed to manage, rather than eliminate, the risk of failure to achieve business objectives and can provide only reasonable 
and not absolute assurance against material misstatement or loss. 
Social, environmental and ethical matters
The Board recognises the growing awareness of social, environmental and ethical matters and it endeavours to take into account the 
interests of the Group’s stakeholders, including its investors, employees, suppliers and business partners, when operating the business.
Employment
At a subsidiary level the individual company has established policies which address key corporate objectives in the management of 
employee relations, communications and employee involvement, training and personal development and equal opportunities.
Health, safety and environmental issues
The Board recognises its legal responsibilities to ensure the well-being, safety and welfare of its employees and to maintain a safe and 
healthy working environment for them and for its visitors and sub-contractors. Health and Safety is on the agenda for regularly scheduled 
Board meetings.
By their nature, the Group’s regular operations are judged to have a low environmental impact and are not expected to give rise to any 
significant, inherent environmental risks over the next 12 months.
The Group is committed to maintaining high standards in implementing appropriate health, safety and environmental protection policies. 
Waste materials are recycled where possible, and hazardous waste is catalogued and handled by licensed specialist disposal companies. 29

Independent Auditor’s Report  
to the Members of Epistem Holdings Plc
Year ended 30 June 2012
We have audited the group and parent company financial statements (the ‘Financial Statements) of Epistem Holdings Plc for the year 
ended 30 June 2012 which comprise the consolidated statement of comprehensive income, the consolidated and parent company 
balance sheets, the consolidated and parent company statement of cash flows, the consolidated and parent company statements  
of changes in equity and the related notes. The financial reporting framework that has been applied in their preparation is applicable  
law and International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the European Union. 
This report is made solely to the company’s members, as a body, in accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies Act 2006. 
Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might state to the company’s members those matters we are required to state to them in 
an auditor’s report and for no other purpose. To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility to anyone 
other than the company and the company’s members as a body, for our audit work, for this report, or for the opinions we have formed.
Respective responsibilities of directors and auditors
As explained more fully in the Statement of Directors’ responsibilities set out in the Directors Report the directors are responsible for the 
preparation of the financial statements and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view. Our responsibility is to audit and express 
an opinion on the financial statements in accordance with applicable law and International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland). Those 
standards require us to comply with the Auditing Practices Board’s (APB’s) Ethical Standards for Auditors.
Scope of the audit of the financial statements
An audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements sufficient to give reasonable 
assurance that the financial statements are free from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or error. This includes an 
assessment of: whether the accounting policies are appropriate to the group’s and the parent company’s circumstances and have  
been consistently applied and adequately disclosed; the reasonableness of significant accounting estimates made by the directors;  
and the overall presentation of the financial statements. In addition, we read all the financial and non-financial information in the  
Annual Report to identify material inconsistencies with the audited financial statements. If we become aware of any apparent  
material misstatements or inconsistencies we consider the implications for our report.
Opinion on financial statements
In our opinion:
•	 the financial statements give a true and fair view of the state of the group’s and the parent company’s affairs as at 30 June 2012,  
and of the group’s loss for the year then ended;
•	 the group financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the European Union; and
•	 the financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of Companies Act 2006.
Opinion on other matters prescribed by the Companies Act 2006
In our opinion:
•	 the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited has been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 
2006; and
•	 the information given in the Directors’ Report for the financial year for which the financial statements are prepared is consistent  
with the financial statements.
Matters on which we are required to report by exception
We have nothing to report in respect of the following matters where the Companies Act 2006 requires us to report to you if, in our opinion:
•	 adequate accounting records have not been kept by the parent company, or returns adequate for our audit have not been received 
from branches not visited by us; or
•	 the parent company financial statements and the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited are not in agreement with 
the accounting records and returns; or 
•	 certain disclosures of directors’ remuneration specified by law are not made; or
•	 we have not received all the information and explanations we required for our audit.

Notes to the Financial Statements
For the year ended 30 June 2012
1. Significant accounting policies
Basis of accounting
The consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (‘IFRS’)  
as adopted by the European Union and therefore comply with Article 4 of the EU IAS Regulation, International Financial Reporting 
Interpretations Committee (‘IFRIC’) interpretations and with those parts of the Companies Act 2006 applicable to companies reporting 
under IFRS.
Epistem Holdings Plc is a company incorporated in the UK.
The consolidated financial statements consolidate those of the Company and its subsidiaries (together referred to as the ‘Group’).  
They are presented in pounds sterling and all values are rounded to the nearest one thousand (£k) except where otherwise indicated.
The consolidated financial statements have been prepared and approved by the Directors in accordance with International Financial 
Reporting Standards as adopted by the EU. 
The accounting policies set out below have, unless otherwise stated, been applied consistently to all periods represented in these 
consolidated financial statements.
The preparation of the financial statements requires management to make judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect  
the application of accounting policies and the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, duration of contracts, income and expenses  
and taxation. 
•	 Determining the value of Deferred Income and Expenditure requires an assessment of the duration of the contract to which the 
deferred income and expenditure relates, and inform decisions as to when to recognise revenue and whether to carry forward costs.
•	 Determining the value of Intangible Assets requires a judgement about the extent to which the relevant asset will be brought into 
economic use by the Company. The filing of a Patent will generally lead to a judgement that the cost of filing the Patent will have future 
economic use. Research and Development expenditure will generally be expensed unless associated income can be identified.
•	 Determining the value of the deferred tax asset requires an estimation of future taxable profits against which the accumulated tax 
losses may be utilised. 
Actual results may differ from these estimates. Estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to 
accounting estimates are recognised in the period in which the estimate is revised and in any future periods affected.
Basis of consolidation
Subsidiaries are entities controlled by the Group. Control exists when the Group has the power, directly or indirectly, to govern the 
financial and operating policies of an entity so as to obtain benefits from its activities. In assessing control, potential voting rights that  
are currently exercisable or convertible are taken into account. The financial statements of subsidiaries are included in the consolidated 
financial statements from the date that control commences until the date that control ceases. Transactions between Group companies 
are eliminated on consolidation.
On 16 March 2007, Epistem Holdings Plc merged with Epistem Limited, and on that date the shareholders of Epistem Limited exchanged 
their shares for equivalent shares in Epistem Holdings Plc. As Epistem Holdings Plc was newly incorporated at the time of the transaction 
under the terms of IFRS 3 ‘Business Combinations’, this transaction has been accounted for as a reverse acquisition, on the basis that the 
shareholders of Epistem Limited gained a controlling interest in the Group. The financial statements therefore represent a continuation of 
the financial statements of Epistem Limited.
Revenue
Revenue is measured at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable and net of discounts and sales-related taxes.
Revenue recognition
(a) Contract revenue
Contract revenue is recognised by reference to the stage of completion of the related transaction at the end of the reporting period.
(b) Collaboration and licensing revenue
Contractually agreed upfront payments and similar non-refundable payments in respect of collaboration or licence agreements which 
are not directly related to on-going research activity are recorded as deferred income and recognised as revenue over the anticipated 
duration of the agreement. Where the anticipated duration of the agreement is modified, the period over which revenue is recognised  
is also modified.
Non-refundable milestone and other payments that are linked to the achievement of significant and substantive technological or 
regulatory hurdles in the research and development process are recognised as revenue upon the achievement of the specified milestone. 
Income which is related to on-going research activity is recognised as the research activity is undertaken, in accordance with the contract. 35
Epistem Holdings Plc
Annual Report 2012
Segment reporting
A segment is a group of assets, liabilities and operations engaged in providing products or services that are subject to risks and returns 
that are different from those of other parts of the business.
Research and development
Research expenditure is written off as it is incurred. Development expenditure is written off as it incurred up to the point of technical and 
commercial validation. Thereafter, costs are carried forward as intangible assets, subject to having met the following criteria – technical 
feasibility, intention and ability to sell the product or model and the availability of resources to complete the development. All intangible 
assets are subject to impairment review and amortisation in each financial reporting period. In assessing value in use, the estimated 
future cash flows are discounted to their net present values using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments  
of the time value of money and the risks specific to that asset.
Intangible assets
Intangible assets are stated at cost less accumulated amortisation and any accumulated impairment losses. Amortisation is calculated 
so as to write off the cost of an intangible asset, less its estimated residual value, over the useful economic life of that asset, as follows:
Acquired intellectual property – the shorter of 5% straight line basis or their estimated useful life
Developed intellectual property – the shorter of 10% straight line basis or their estimated useful life
Patents – over the shorter of 17 years or their estimated useful lives on a straight-line basis
No amortisation is charged on those assets which are not yet available for use.
Plant and equipment
Plant and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and any accumulated impairment losses. Depreciation is 
calculated so as to write off the cost of an asset, less its estimated residual value, over the useful economic life of that asset as follows:
Plant and machinery – 25% reducing balance basis
Fixtures and fittings – 25% reducing balance basis
Equipment – 25% reducing balance basis
Finance lease agreements
Assets held under finance lease agreements are capitalised and disclosed under tangible fixed assets at their fair value. The capital 
element of the future payments is treated as a liability and the interest is charged to the consolidated income account so as to produce  
a constant periodic rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability.
Operating lease agreements
Rentals applicable to operating leases where substantially all of the benefits and risks of ownership remain with the lessor are charged 
against profits over the period of the lease. 
Foreign currencies
Transactions in foreign currencies are translated at the exchange rate ruling at the date of the transaction. Monetary assets and liabilities 
denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at the rate of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date. Non-monetary items carried 
at fair value and denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at the rates prevailing on the date when fair value is determined.  
The foreign currency risks relating to assets and liabilities are detailed in Note 18.
Exchange differences arising on the settlement of monetary items and on the retranslation of monetary items are taken to the income 
account. Exchange differences arising on non-monetary items, carried at fair value, are included in the income account, except for such 
non-monetary items in respect of which gains and losses are recorded in equity.
Share-based payments
The Group issues equity-settled share-based payments to certain employees (including Directors). Equity-settled share-based 
payments are measured at fair value at the date of grant. The fair value determined at the grant date of the equity-settled share-based 
payments is expensed on a straight line basis over the vesting period, together with a corresponding increase in equity, based upon the 
Group’s estimate of the shares that will eventually vest.
Fair value is measured using the Black-Scholes pricing model. The expected life used in the model has been adjusted, based on 
management’s best estimate, for the effects of non-transferability, exercise restrictions and behavioural considerations.
Where the terms of an equity settled transaction are modified, as a minimum an expense is recognised as if the terms had not  
been modified. In addition, an expense is recognised for any increase in the value of the transaction as a result of the modification,  
as measured at the date of modification. 36

Financials
Notes to the Financial Statements (continued)
For the year ended 30 June 2012
1. Significant accounting policies (continued)
Share-based payments (continued)
Where an equity settled transaction is cancelled, it is treated as if it had vested on the date of the cancellation, and any expense not yet 
recognised for the transaction is recognised immediately. However, if a new transaction is substituted for the cancelled transaction and 
designated as a replacement transaction on the date that it is granted, the cancelled and new transactions are treated as if they were a 
modification of the original transaction, as described in the previous paragraph.
The issuance by the Company of share options to employees of its subsidiaries represents additional capital contributions and the fair 
value of such options and awards is therefore recognised as an increase in the Company’s investment in Group undertakings with a 
corresponding increase in total equity shareholders’ funds.
Share Incentive Plan
The Company operates a HMR&C qualifying Share Incentive Plan. Under the scheme, the Company will contribute Matching shares  
to employees who elect to invest in Epistem shares under the scheme. 
The Matching shares have vesting conditions which require participants to remain employed with the Company and retain their 
investment in Epistem shares for at least three years. The cost of the Matching shares is expensed as and when the vesting conditions 
have been satisfied.
Pension contributions
Contributions to personal pension plans of employees on a defined contributions basis are charged to the income statement in the year 
in which they are payable.
Financial instruments
Financial instruments are classified and accounted for, according to the substance of the contractual arrangement, as either financial 
assets, financial liabilities or equity instruments. An equity instrument is any contract that evidences a residual interest in the assets of 
the Company after deducting all of its liabilities. 
Trade and other receivables
Trade and other debtors are recognised and carried forward at invoiced amounts less provisions for any doubtful debts. Bad debts are 
written off when identified.
Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents are included in the balance sheet at cost. Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash at bank and in hand  
and short-term deposits with an original maturity of three months or less.
Interest-bearing loans and borrowings
All loans and borrowings are recognised initially at cost, which is the fair value of the consideration received, net of issue costs 
associated with the borrowing.
After initial recognition, interest-bearing loans and borrowings are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method.  
Gains or losses are recognised in the consolidated income account when liabilities are derecognised or impaired, as well as through  
the amortisation process.
Investments
Investments in subsidiaries are stated at cost less any provisions for impairment. An impairment is recognised when the recoverable 
amount of the investment is less than the carrying amount. 37

Annual Report 2012
Taxation
Current tax is provided at amounts expected to be paid (or recovered) using the tax rates and laws that have been enacted, or 
substantially enacted, by the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is recognised in respect of all temporary differences identified at the balance sheet date, except to the extent that the 
deferred tax arises from the initial recognition of goodwill (if amortisation of goodwill is not deductible for tax purposes) or the initial 
recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction which is not a business combination and at the time of the transaction affects neither 
accounting profit nor taxable profit and loss. Temporary differences are differences between the carrying amount of the Group’s assets 
and liabilities and their tax base.
Deferred tax liabilities may be offset against deferred tax assets within the same taxable entity. Any remaining deferred tax asset is 
recognised only when, on the basis of all available evidence, it can be regarded as probable that there will be suitable taxation profits, 
within the same jurisdiction, in the foreseeable future against which the deductible temporary difference can be utilised.
Deferred tax is provided on temporary differences arising in subsidiaries, jointly controlled entities and associates, except where the 
timing of reversal of the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future. Deferred tax is measured at the average tax  
rates that are expected to apply in the periods in which the asset is realised or liability settled, based on tax rates and laws that have 
been enacted or substantially enacted by the balance sheet date. Measurement of deferred tax liabilities and assets reflects the tax 
consequence expected to fall from the manner in which the asset or liability is recovered or settled.
Parent company assets
The assets of the parent Company are subject to impairment review in each financial period.
New standards and interpretations not applied
The International Accounting Standards Board (‘IASB’) and IFIRC have issued the following standards and interpretations with an 
effective date for financial years beginning on or after 1 July 2012:

At 30 June 2012, the change in the corporation tax rate to 24% had been substantially enacted and therefore the deferred taxation 
assets included within these results have been calculated using a UK corporation tax rate of 24%.
The Group had losses, as computed for tax purposes, of approximately £6,577k (2011: £1,770k) available to carry forward to future periods.
In accordance with the provisions of the Finance Act 2000 in respect of research and development allowances, the Group is entitled to 
claim tax credits for certain research and development expenditure. The amount included in the financial statements in respect of the 
year ended 30 June 2012 is £nil (2011: £nil).
8. Profit attributable to members of the parent company
The profit dealt with in the accounts of the parent company was £14k (2011: £18k).
9. (Loss)/earnings per share
The basic profit/(loss) per share is calculated by dividing the earnings attributable to ordinary shareholders for the year by the weighted 
average number of ordinary shares in issue during the year.
The diluted earnings per share is calculated by adjusting the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding to assume 
conversion of all dilutive potential ordinary shares in relation to share options and share warrants and also the weighted average Matching 
Shares held by the Epistem SIP which are not yet vested. The number of share options has been adjusted to take into account the issue 
price and the fair value, consistent with IAS 33, ‘Earnings per share’.

(a)  The expected term used in the model is five years and is based upon the Directors’ best estimates for the effects of exercise 
restrictions and behavioural considerations;
(b)  The dividend yield of 0% reflects the absence of a history of paying dividends and a clear dividend policy at the relevant grant dates;
(c)  Prior to 2011, the expected volatility was estimated by the Directors after inspection of the financial statements of comparable 
businesses in the same business sector as the Group. Thereafter, the expected volatility has been calculated by reference to the 
historic share price of the Company;
(d) The risk free rate used is based upon the prevailing UK bank base rate at the date of the grant;
(e)  These options vest on dates dependant on anniversaries of commencing employment with the Group which commenced  
1 September 2005 with the final tranche vesting on 1 September 2008;
(f) The performance conditions for these options to vest were satisfied in 2010;
(g)  These options are subject to performance criteria which are appropriate to the option holders’ role within the Company and which 
are assessed by the Remuneration Committee.
(h)  These options may be exercised following the third anniversary of grant and are subject to performance criteria which are 
appropriate to the option holders’ role within the Company and which are assessed by the Remuneration Committee.
(i)  These options may be exercised when the Remuneration Committee determine that the Company has achieved a compound annual 
growth in EBITDA of at least 15% for the three year period commencing 01 July 2010.

(b) Share Investment Plan
The Company operates the Epistem Share Investment Plan, SIP, which is open to Directors and employees in accordance with Inland 
Revenue approved rules. Under the terms of the SIP, Directors and employees may invest up to £125 per month to be invested in 
ordinary shares (‘Partnership Shares’) in the Company at the prevailing market price. At the same time as each monthly subscription,  
a maximum of two Matching Shares for each Partnership Share will be acquired on behalf of the SIP’s participants. Both the Partnership 
and the Matching Shares are purchased on behalf of the scheme’s participants by Epistem SIP Trustee Limited, a wholly owned 
subsidiary of the Company. Participants, who must be employed by the Company may withdraw their Matching Shares once their 
associated Partnership Shares have been held for three years. The cost of the Matching Shares is expensed as and when this vesting 
condition is met.

18. Financial risk management objectives and policies
The Group holds or issues financial instruments in order to achieve two main objectives, being:
(a) to finance its operations;
(b) to manage its exposure to interest and currency risks arising from its operations and from its sources of finance.
In addition, various financial instruments (e.g. trade receivables, trade payables, accruals and prepayments) arise directly from the 
Group’s and the Company’s operations.
Transactions in financial instruments result in the Group assuming or transferring to another party one or more of the financial risks 
described below.
Interest rate risk
The Group currently finances its operations through reserves of cash and liquid resources and does not have a borrowing requirement. 
Surplus cash at bank is placed on deposits at variable rates. The Board monitors the financial markets and the Group’s own requirements 
to ensure that the policies are exercised in the Group’s best interests. 48

18. Financial risk management objectives and policies (continued)
The following table demonstrates the sensitivity to a possible change in interest rates on the Group’s profit before tax through the impact 
of floating rate cash balances.

Cash and cash equivalents 25 3 
An increase in 25 basis points would have a similar opposite effect.
Credit risk
The Group monitors credit risk closely and considers that its current policies of credit checks meet its objectives of managing exposure 
to credit risk.
The Group has no significant concentrations of credit risk. Amounts shown in the balance sheet best represent the maximum credit risk 
exposure in the event that other parties fail to perform their obligations under financial instruments.
Liquidity risk
The Board’s policy aims to ensure that sufficient funds are held on a short-term basis in order to meet operational needs.
Currency risk
The Group’s functional currency is sterling. The exposure to currency risk relates to licence income and those short-term trade 
receivables which are not invoiced in sterling. There are no significant costs incurred that involve payments in foreign currency.
The Group has no forward contracts at the year end (2011: nil) to manage foreign currency risk.

Notes to the Company Financial Statements
For the year ended 30 June 2012
(a) Investments
Company
The Company is the holding company of the Group. 
The Company owns 100% of the issued share capital of Epistem Limited, Epistem SIP Trustees Limited and Visible Genomics Limited 
(companies registered in England and Wales) and Epistem Inc. incorporated in the United States of America. The principal activities of 
the subsidiary companies are:
Epistem Limited and Epistem Inc. – the provision of services to the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries;
Epistem SIP Trustees Limited – to act as trustee to the Epistem Share Incentive Plan;
Visible Genomics Limited – a dormant company.
On 28 July, 2010, Epistem Holdings Plc acquired 100% of the share capital of Visible Genomics Limited, whose principal activity had been 
the development of diagnostic assays and equipment. The assets of Visible Genomics Limited on 27 July 2010 are summarised below:
     
£’000
Acquired intangible assets 100
Short-term liabilities (25)
Long-term liabilities (75)
– 
On 28 July 2010, the above assets and liabilities were hived into Epistem Limited and Visible Genomics Limited ceased to trade. The 
consideration payable to the vendors of Visible Genomics Limited is related to performance (an earnout) during the three year period  
to 30 June 2013 and is capped at £2.85m. The Directors have assessed the performance during the period since 28 July 2010 and have 
concluded that the criteria will not be met and, accordingly, that no consideration would be payable. However, the performance criteria 
are currently being reviewed with new criteria being considered. If agreed, these criteria are likely to be met during the current financial 
period, leading to the full amount of the earnout (£2.85m) becoming payable. The consideration may be paid either by the issue of shares 
in Epistem Holdings Plc or by the issue of loan notes.

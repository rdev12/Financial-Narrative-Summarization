Chairman’s statement
Introduction
I am pleased to report that Porvair continues
to make progress against its financial and
strategic objectives.
Results
Revenues in the year to 30 November 2013
were £84.3 million (2012: £76.5 million) and
profit before tax rose by 25% to £7.8 million
(2012: £6.3 million). These are record results
for the Group. Basic earnings per share were 
12.7 pence (2012: 10.1 pence), an increase 
of 26%.
Cash generated from operations was 
£12.3 million (2012: £9.2 million). After interest
and tax, net cash generated from operating
activities was £9.7 million (2012: £7.4 million).
At 30 November 2013 the Group was net
cash positive for the first time with net cash 
on hand of £0.6 million (2012: net debt 
of £3.9 million).
Dividends
The Directors recommend an improved 
final dividend of 1.8 pence per share 
(2012: 1.6 pence), making the full year
dividend 2.9 pence per share (2012: 
2.6 pence), an increase of 12%.
Board composition
Michael Gatenby retired from the Board 
at the 2013 AGM in April. Andrew Walker 
will retire at the 2014 AGM, having been a 
director for nine years. They have both made 
a substantial contribution to the Group’s
direction and strategy during their time on the
Board. We thank them and wish them well.
Following the 2013 AGM, Andrew Walker
succeeded Michael Gatenby as senior Non-
Executive Director and Paul Dean succeeded
him as Chairman of the Audit Committee. 
Paul Dean will succeed Andrew Walker as
senior Non-Executive Director following the
2014 AGM.
Governance
The Board sets high standards for its
corporate governance and has in place
monitoring systems to ensure that those
standards are upheld throughout the Group.
The Board complied with all aspects of the 
UK Corporate Governance code throughout
the year ended 30 November 2013 with the
exception of fixed terms of employment for
Non-Executive Directors, however all of the
Directors offer themselves for re-election 
at each AGM. 
New formats have been adopted for our
Strategic and Remuneration Reports, as
required by latest governance guidelines. 
For the first time at the 2014 AGM, shareholders
will have the opportunity to approve the
Group’s remuneration policies as well as 
the Remuneration Report.
Staff
Looking back over the last five or six years, it is
remarkable how much has changed at Porvair.
In sales terms we are almost double the size
we were in 2007, a significant achievement by
our staff. This year we have been joined by
employees of Eisenmann Metallurgical and
Thomas Cain, and we are pleased to welcome
them to the Group. The Board is most grateful
to all Porvair’s staff for their hard work and
commitment.
Current trading and outlook
Porvair’s strategic direction remains consistent
and continues to produce good results. 
2013 finished well and order books are
healthy. The fundamentals of the markets in
which we operate look satisfactory. The larger
contracts announced during the year are
progressing well and are expected to have 
a positive impact on the Group, with their
accounting implications outlined on page 7.
The Board expects that provided economic
conditions allow, the underlying business will
continue to grow. The Group expects to invest
in additional manufacturing capacity in 2014 
in the UK, USA and China to meet growing
demand, and notes that the Group’s new
product pipeline is promising. A positive start
has been made to 2014.

06 Porvair plc Annual Report & Accounts 2013
Covs 1-36, 92 tp_Layout 1  03/03/2014  13:43  Page 9 Overview of 2013
The Group achieved record results in 2013 
with annual revenue growth of 10%. Proﬁt
before tax grew 25% and earnings per share
26%. Notwithstanding capacity expansion
investments and two small acquisitions, strong
cash generation enabled the Group to ﬁnish the
year free of net debt for the ﬁrst time. Order
books carried forward into 2014 are healthy.
Orders for aviation ﬁltration products grew 
14% in 2013 driven by recent new product
introductions. Nuclear and bioscience orders
were also strong. Sales to environmental
laboratories were up 13%. After a slow start,
revenues from Metals Filtration improved in 
the second half to ﬁnish up 2% for the year.
Several large contracts were announced in
energy markets during the year. These will have
a signiﬁcant beneﬁcial impact on the Group
results through to 2017, with the initial beneﬁts
showing in the 2013 results.
Capital investments were made in 2013 to
expand UK aviation and Chinese manufacturing
capacity. Further such investments are planned
for 2014 in order to support longer term growth.
Plans for investment and future development
In 2013 Porvair achieved two signiﬁcant
milestones. Large contracts were secured 
that will underpin manufacturing activity in
Microﬁltration for at least the next two years 
and strong underlying trading enabled the
Group to ﬁnish the year with net cash on the
balance sheet.
Together these will enable a period of
accelerated investment. In 2014 we plan to
increase capital investment substantially: 
• We intend to consolidate and expand our UK
facilities at New Milton in order to free space
for aviation and industrial ﬁltration growth in
Fareham. Aviation sales have grown strongly
recently and we need more capacity. 
• Following the acquisition of the trade and
assets of Eisenmann Metallurgical LLC in June
2013 we will expand its manufacturing facility
in Caribou, Maine, during 2014 and invest in
production equipment to increase its capacity.
• Having built a new factory at Xiaogan, China,
for Metals Filtration in 2013 we expect to
expand its production capability and capacity
in 2014. 
• We will make further investments in the
production capabilities in the US.
These and other projects will increase expected
capital investment in 2014 to around three 
times its level of recent years. Capacity increases
and equipment upgrades are necessary due 
to the impact that new product introductions
have had on the business. We expect this
capacity pressure to continue, with the 2014
product development pipeline looking promising.
Interesting work is going on in bioscience
ﬁltration, metals ﬁltration manufacturing, water
analysis, nuclear ﬁltration and others.
Encouraging these projects is central to 
Porvair’s business model.
The 2013 results show the early beneﬁts of 
the large contract wins, and these will become
even more apparent in 2014. The contracts in
question are principally those with Posco, the
UK Government and Reliance Industries. All of
which have been previously announced. The
ﬁnancial impact of these contracts is expected
to cause the published results over the next
three to four years to ﬂuctuate more than has
generally been the case.
• Multi-year contracts are recognised under
long-term accounting rules, which means that
revenues are expected to receive a one-off
boost in 2014, causing them to be higher than
the underlying growth rate the Group would
normally deliver. Revenues might then be
expected to return to the underlying levels 
in 2015.
• Proﬁts are recognised only after due
consideration of the potential risks, outstanding
liabilities and warranties on each project. Proﬁt
recognition could therefore be spread over the
period between 2013 and 2017. 
• Net cash inﬂows are expected to arise
principally in 2013 and 2014. Whilst we will
maintain suitable cash reserves against the
possible needs of the contracts, this cash will
be used to re-invest in the business as
outlined above.

Strategy and business model
Our strategy
Porvair’s strategy has remained consistent for several years. 
It is to generate shareholder value through the development of
specialist filtration and environmental technology businesses, both
organically and by acquisition. Such businesses have certain key
characteristics in common: 
• specialist design or engineering skills are required;
• product use and replacement is mandated by regulation, quality
accreditation or a maintenance cycle; and
• products will be designed into a specification and will typically 
have long life cycles.
Since 2007 this strategy has delivered revenue growth of 85% 
(11% CAGR) and cash from operations of £48 million. In 2013 
the Group’s after tax operating profit return on operating capital 
was 39% (2012: 30%).
Our business model
Porvair’s business model is as follows:
Focus on end-markets which show long term growth potential
and where product use is mandatory.
Make new product development a core business activity.
Establish geographic presence where end-markets require.
Maintain a conservative balance sheet. Re-invest in both
organic and acquired growth and pay a progressive dividend.
This business model determines the
Group’s day-to-day activities:
How our strategy and business
model work together
Our strengths
• We focus on four end-markets: aviation; energy and
industrial; environmental laboratories; and molten
metals. All have clear structural growth drivers. 
• Our products are specialist in nature: they typically
protect more costly or complex downstream systems.
As a result they are replaced regularly. Over 80% 
of our annual revenues are from repeat orders.
• We encourage new product development in order 
to generate growth rates in excess of the underlying
market. Around 35% of our annual revenues are
now derived from recent product introductions. 
We try to build good intellectual property around our
product developments. About 30% of our revenues
are derived from patent protected products.
• Our geographic presence follows the markets we
serve. 46% of revenues are from The Americas,
where aviation and metals ﬁltration are strong. 
18% of revenues are in Asia and Australasia, where
sales into water analysis markets are growing.
• Porvair is a cash generative business. We aim to
maintain a conservative balance sheet, meeting
dividend and investment needs within our existing
debt facilities and generating free cash ﬂow to pay
down debt. In the last two years we have expanded
manufacturing capacity in the UK and China and
made ﬁve small acquisitions. 
Operating structure
• The Group has two divisions. The Microﬁltration
division serves the aviation, environmental laboratory
and energy/industrial markets. The Metals Filtration
division serves global aluminium, NAFTA iron foundry
and super alloy markets. 
• The Group manufactures in the UK, US, Germany
and China.

Capital investment to
support growth
Investing for the future
Since 2007 Porvair has delivered 11% CAGR
revenue growth. During that period:
• The Group’s aviation revenue has grown
strongly;
• New products have driven sales and 
margin growth; 
• Our presence in Asia has increased to 
18% of revenue; and
• Our net debt has been eliminated.
In 2014, capacity increases are planned 
across the Group to allow room for further
growth. With the 2014 new product pipeline
looking promising we expect capital
expenditure in 2014 to be around three 
times its level of recent years.
Our investment priorities for 2014 are:
• To consolidate and expand our UK facilities 
at New Milton in order to free space for
aviation and industrial ﬁltration growth. 
• To expand the manufacturing facilities 
and production capacity in Caribou, ME.  
• To expand the production capability of 
our new factory at Xiaogan, China for 
Metals Filtration. 
• To make further investments in Metals
Filtration and Seal Analytical production
capabilities in the US.

New product development
drives organic growth
New product development
New product development is a core 
activity for the Group. We undertake it 
to generate growth rates in excess of the
underlying market. We try to build good
intellectual property positions around our
product developments through patents 
and know-how.
In Metals Filtration we have three main
patented product ranges:
• Selee CSX™ for aluminium ﬁltration, where
we have a high global market share; 
• Selee IC™ for gray and ductile iron ﬁltration;
and 
• Selee SA™ for the ﬁltration of nickel-
cobalt alloys. 
In Microﬁltration interesting work is going on 
in bioscience ﬁltration, water analysis, nuclear
ﬁltration and aviation product development.
Our priorities for 2014 include:
• Development and trials of a new aluminium
ﬁlter for high grade lithium alloys.
• Further customer trials of a new design 
of metal ﬁltration ﬁlters.
• Further development of a patented DNA
ﬁltration product and other bioscience
applications.
• Exploitation of the design rights of the range
of water analysers.
• Development of more robust, longer lasting
industrial ﬁltration media.
Adding value through
acquisitions
Enhancing our capabilities
Our business model encourages investment 
in both organic and acquired growth. Over the
last two years the Group has invested £8.6
million in ﬁve small acquisitions:
• Block digester range from Aim Lab
Automation Technologies;
• Trade and assets of Pell Industries;
• Trade and assets of Pulse Instrumentation;
• Trade and assets of Eisenmann 
Metallurgical; and 
• Trade and assets of Thomas Cain. 
These acquisitions contribute to the steady
growth of the Group and extend our product
ranges and geographic presence in our
markets.
Our priorities for 2014 include:
• Expanding the manufacturing facilities 
and production capacity of Eisenmann
Metallurgical.
• Completing the integration of the 
2013 acquisitions.
• Identifying further potential opportunities.

Lithium Aluminium Filter
Customer need
Lithium aluminium is a stronger
lighter alloy than aluminium with 
a growing use in the aerospace
industry.  In common with
aluminium it needs to be ﬁltered
to produce high purity metal,
however in its molten state it
corrodes traditional ﬁlters.
Porvair’s response
Porvair has developed and is
testing a new ﬁlter using a
different ceramic formulation to
signiﬁcantly reduce corrosion 
and thereby produce higher 
purity metal.

Performance in 2013
After a slow start to 2013 the Metals Filtration
division had a stronger second half, finishing
the year with record revenues of £28.5 million. 
The Board was pleased to note that this
division was better able to cope with a modest
sales downturn in early 2013 than had
previously been the case. This is mainly due 
to higher operating margins achieved in recent
years, with patented products accounting for
the majority of sales in this division. Despite
the slower start to the year, operating profits
finished in line with 2012’s record result 
of £2.4 million.
Conditions in this division’s end-markets 
have been mixed across the year, with global
aluminium pricing relatively low but NAFTA
auto production staying at satisfactory levels.
In this environment we have been able to build
market share by demonstrating superior
product performance. We have three main
product ranges, all patented: 
• Selee CSX™ for aluminium filtration, where
we have a high global market share. This
product has a unique environmental footprint
in being free of phosphates.
• Selee IC™ for gray and ductile iron filtration.
This range is sold principally in the US and
offers excellent filtration efficiency.
• Selee SA™ for the filtration of nickel-cobalt
alloys. This niche application requires
exceptional filtration performance and uses 
a highly proprietary manufacturing technique.
The product development pipeline in this
division is promising. In recent months we
have successfully trialed a new aluminium 
filter for high grade lithium alloys that are
increasingly used in aerospace applications.
As previously noted, we have been developing
an entirely new design of filter over the last 
18 months, and this work continues to go
well. Several successful customer trials 
have been held and we are making modest
revenues from this project. In 2014 we will
start to see whether this remains a niche
application or whether it can develop into 
a more substantial programme.
A new plant was built at Xiaogan, in China, in
the year. The new facility is substantially larger
than its predecessor and was built on time
and under budget. Production started in the
final quarter. We plan to develop this facility 
to meet the needs of the domestic Chinese
market. Further investment in production
equipment will be necessary, with installation
likely towards the end of 2014.

Divisional review – Microfiltration
Performance in 2013
The Microfiltration division had a good year with
revenues increasing 15%to a record £55.8 million.
Order books going into 2014 are healthy.
Several large contracts are now underway in
this division. All are proceeding satisfactorily. 
A second delivery under the US$10 million
POSCO contract was made towards the end
of 2013. POSCO expect to start production
trials of its plant that turns coal to substitute
natural gas at Gwangyang, South Korea, later 
in 2014. A much larger contract for a similar
project was signed in February 2013 with
Reliance Industries for their plant at Jamnagar,
India. The scope of this work was extended 
in April and again in August. Finally, an 
£11.3 million contract with the UK Government
was announced in January 2013, for deliveries
starting in 2014. The likely beneficial financial
impact of these projects is discussed on page 7.
Orders in aviation and nuclear filtration have
grown again in 2013, with a 14% increase in
aviation orders, meaning we are starting to hit
capacity constraints. As noted on page 7, we
will expand our facilities both in the UK and US 
to provide room for further growth.
The US based operation grew 24% in 2013, a
good result, excluding the maiden contribution
from Eisenmann Metallurgical (“CEM”), acquired
in June 2013. CEM is a good bolt-on acquisition
for the Group, bringing product and market
expertise with a committed and skillful workforce
in Caribou, Maine. As noted on page 7, we will
invest in this facility in 2014 to allow room for
growth, and have an expanded management
and commercial team in place to drive further
growth. Trading at CEM since acquisition has
been satisfactory, with integration activities
focused on IT and financial systems. This work
is complete, with the Caribou facility now
operating well as a satellite plant.
We have been working for several years 
on some interesting intellectual property in
bioscience filtration. A patented DNA filtration
product is under development in collaboration
with the University of Swansea and with some
financial support from the Welsh Government.
In an unrelated project, an agreement was
struck with Thermo Fisher Scientific (“Thermo”)
under which Porvair will licence its technology
to Thermo who will market frit-less solid phase
extraction columns under the SOLA brand.
Porvair will receive licence and royalty income
and manufacture the product for Thermo. This
sort of opportunity, where Porvair technology 
is licenced to others, is of interest to the Board
and results will be monitored closely.
Seal Analytical revenues grew 13%, helped 
by small acquisitions in 2012 and 2013. Seal is
the market leading supplier of equipment and
consumables for the detection of inorganic
contamination in water, a well defined niche
market that will grow as water quality standards
improve across the world.Although its US
markets remained quiet for most of the year,
demand from China was robust, and parts of
Europe showed the first signs of improvement
in several years.Design rights to a range of water
analysers were acquired early in the year, and
these have transferred to Seal’s US operation.
Cost savings have been found and
manufacturing is now fully integrated. In
September the Group purchased the trade 
and assets of Thomas Cain Inc. (“Cain”), a
manufacturer of complementary instruments
and consumables. Initial trading at Cain has
been satisfactory and the outlook for 2014 
is good.

The operating profit margin improved to 10.3%
(2012: 9.4%). This improvement arises from 
the benefit of higher revenue driving operational
gearing and a steady improvement in the quality
of business throughout the Group. Following
several years of steadily improving margins in
Metals Filtration, operating margins were
maintained in the year and the growth in
Microfiltration was accompanied by a 1.7%
improvement in operating margins in the year.
The operating performance of the Microfiltration
and Metals Filtration divisions are described in
detail in the Chief Executive’s report and below. 
The operating loss associated with the Other
Unallocated segment was £2.4 million (2012:
£1.9 million), which mainly comprises Group
corporate costs. These include new business
development costs and general financial costs.
The operating profit includes amortisation
charges on intangible assets arising on
acquisition of £0.2 million (2012: £0.1 million),
acquisition expenses written off of £0.1 million
(2012: £0.1 million) and share based payment
charges of £0.5 million (2012: £0.4 million).
Impact of exchange rate movements 
on performance
The international nature of the Group’s business
means that relative movements in exchange
rates can have a significant impact on reported
performance. The average rate used for
translating the results of US operations into
Sterling was US$1.57:£ (2012: US$1.58:£) 
and the Group’s Euro denominated operations
were translated at €1.18:£ (2012: €1.22:£). 
The slightly stronger dollar and stronger Euro
rates accounted for 1% of the revenue growth
and 1% of the operating profit growth such that
currency differences on translation had only a
marginal impact compared with the prior year.
The Group sold forward the majority of its UK
business’ 2013 US dollar revenue during the
financial year and achieved rates between
$1.51:£ and $1.6:£ similar to the rates 
achieved in 2012.
At 30 November 2013 the Group had 
US$19 million of outstanding forward foreign
exchange contracts taken out to hedge the
future revenue on the Group’s large contracts.
The Group has applied hedge accounting to
these transactions and a gain of £0.9 million 
is shown in the consolidated statement of
comprehensive income.
Finance costs
Net interest payable decreased to £0.8 million
(2012: £0.9 million). Included within interest
payable are finance costs in relation to the
defined benefit pension scheme, which were
£0.4 million (2012: £0.4 million) in the year.
Other net interest payable reduced as a result 
of lower borrowings and a lower margin on the
new facilities in place from January 2013.
The Group has a policy of maintaining between
40% and 60% of its borrowings on fixed interest
terms. It achieved this by taking out interest rate
swaps to fix the interest rates on certain of its
borrowings. These provided some protection
for the Group in the event of interest rate rises.
As a result of the significant decline in the
Group’s borrowings in the year, the Group had
approximately 75% of its gross borrowings held
at a fixed rate at 30 November 2013, however
the fixed rate contracts expire shortly after the
year end. For the time being, while the Group’s
gross borrowings are low, the Board has
concluded that further interest rate swaps need
not be taken out and the Group’s borrowings
are at a floating rate from 13 December 2013.
The contracts in place during the year are
summarised below:
Fixed rate Principal amount Principal terms
1.88% $5 million Effective from 
12 December 2010
to 12 December 2013
2.29% $2.5 million Effective from 
12 December 2011
to 12 December 2013
Interest cover was 11 times (2012: 8 times);
excluding the impact of the pension finance
charge the interest cover is 21 times (2012: 
14 times).
Tax
The Group tax charge was £2.4 million (2012:
£2.0 million). This is an effective rate of 30%
(2012: 32%), higher than the UK standard
corporate tax rate of 23.3% (2012: 24.7%),
mainly as a result of higher tax rates on profits
made in Germany and the US. The tax charge

comprises current tax of £2.3 million (2012: 
£1.8 million) and a deferred tax charge of 
£0.1 million (2012: £0.2 million).
The deferred tax asset of £2.4 million (2012:
£2.0 million) relates to the deficit on the pension
fund and share based payments totaling £3.7
million (2012: £3.1 million) offset by a net £1.3
million (2012: £1.1 million) deferred tax liability 
in relation to accelerated capital allowances,
capitalised development costs and other timing
differences. The Group no longer has any
unrecognised deferred tax assets arising from
previous losses.
Total equity
Total equity at 30 November 2013 was 
£47.7 million (2012: £45.2 million), an increase
of 6% over the prior year. Increases in total
equity arose from: profit after tax of £6.0 million
(2012: £4.9 million), after adding back the
charge for employee share option schemes;
£0.7 million (2012: £nil) in relation to share
issues on option exercises; and £1.0 million
(2012: £0.1 million) arising from hedge
accounting instruments. Dividends paid of £1.2
million (2012: £1.0 million); an actuarial loss of
£3.1 million net of tax (2012: £0.6 million); and
exchange losses on translation of £0.9 million
(2012: loss of £0.3 million) reduced total equity.
Return on capital employed
The increase in the profits of the Group
compared with a stable asset base led to an
increase in the return on capital employed to
13% (2012: 10%). Excluding the impact of
goodwill, the return on operating capital
employed increased to 39% (2012: 30%).

Net working capital was tightly controlled 
and reduced by £1.1 million, although revenue
rose by 10% in the year. Inventories increased
as a result of the increased revenue. Trade and
other receivables also increased a little as a
result of higher revenue but the majority of the
increase relates to advance payments made 
to suppliers in relation to the Group’s large
contracts. Trade and other payables increased
significantly, in part because of the receipt of
cash ahead of the recognition of revenue on 
the Group’s large projects.
Net interest paid represents the bank interest
charged in the year. It reduced as bank
borrowings fell in the year.
Tax payments in the US have increased,
following the final utilisation in 2012 of past 
tax losses in the Metals Filtration division. Tax
payments are now more closely in line with 
the Group’s tax charge.
Capital expenditure
Capital expenditure was £2.0 million (2012: 
£2.0 million) offset by £0.5 million (2012: £nil)
received on the disposal of a UK property. The
principal investments in 2013 were a new plant
in Xiaogan, China, for Metals Filtration and
additional plant in the Microfiltration division 
to increase capacity, principally to deliver 
growth in aerospace business.
Looking forward the Board is planning
significant capital projects in 2014 to provide
new and upgraded plants in the UK, US and
further increases to production capacity
throughout the Group. Capital expenditure 
is likely to rise to around three times the 
normal level.
Acquisitions
The Group invested £5.1 million in two US
based acquisitions in the year: on 4 June 2013
the Group purchased the trade and assets of
Eisenmann Metallurgical LLC, a manufacturer 
of specialist filters; and on 20 September 2013
the Group purchased the trade and assets 
of Thomas Cain Inc., a manufacturer of
environmental laboratory equipment and
consumables. These acquisitions gave rise to
goodwill of £3.7 million. £3.3 million was paid 
in cash in the year. Up to a further £1.9 million
deferred and contingent consideration is due,
including £0.1 million in relation to acquisitions
made in 2012.

revenue and £0.1 million of operating profit 
in the year after charging £0.1 million of
acquisition costs. 
It is estimated that had the acquisitions been
owned for a full year they would have contributed
£3.8 million of revenue and £0.7 million of
operating profit in the year.
Pension schemes
The Group continues to support its defined
benefit pension scheme in the UK, which is
closed to new members, and to provide access
to defined contribution schemes for its US
employees and other UK employees.
The Group’s total pension cost was £1.4 million
(2012: £1.2 million). £1.0 million (2012: £0.8
million) was recorded as an operating cost and
£0.4 million (2012: £0.4 million) was recorded 
as a finance charge. The Group continues to
account for its pension schemes under IAS 19
and will adopt IAS 19 revised in the year ending
30 November 2014. Had the Group adopted 
IAS 19 revised it is estimated that the Group’s
pension charge in the year would have been 
£0.2 million higher.
The Group recorded a retirement benefit
obligation of £11.9 million (2012: £8.5 million).
The increase in the deficit principally related to 
an actuarial loss in the year of £3.6 million (2012:
£1.2 million), which in turn arose as a result of a
change in the mortality assumptions. The other
assumptions adopted were in line with the
previous year.
The scheme had 53 (2012: 54) active members,
289 (2012: 295) deferred members and 265
(2012: 265) pensioners at 30 November 2013.
The life expectancy of members of the scheme 
at age 65 is assumed to be 21.5 years (2012:
19.7 years) for men and 23.7 years (2012: 22.3
years) for women.
A full triennial actuarial valuation of the assets 
and liabilities of the defined benefit scheme was
completed in 2013, based on data at 31 March
2012. As a result of this review, the Group and
the Trustees agreed to alter the employer’s
contributions from 8.2% of salary to 13.3% 
of salary. Additionally, the Group committed to
make a £194,000 annual contribution towards
the running costs of the scheme from March
2014, which will increase by 3.25% per annum
thereafter. The Group also committed to make
additional annual contributions, to cover the 
past service deficit, of £456,000 per annum
commencing in December 2013, increasing 
by 5% per annum thereafter. The funding shortfall
is expected to be eliminated by December 2027.
The next full actuarial valuation of the scheme will
be based on the pension scheme’s position at 
31 March 2015 and is expected to be completed
before June 2016.
Borrowings and bank finance
At the year end, the Group had net cash
balances of £0.6 million (2012: net debt of £3.9
million) comprising cash balances of £6.8 million
(2012: £7.3 million) offset by gross borrowings 
of £6.2 million (2012: £11.2 million). Borrowings
of £4.6 million (US$7.5 million) (2012: £6.4 million
(US$10.3 million)) are held in US dollars.
The Group signed new five year borrowing
facilities on 25 January 2013 comprising a five
year US$20 million revolving credit facility, a 
£2.5 million term loan (reduced to £1.75 million at
30 November 2013) and a £2.5 million overdraft
facility. These facilities have margins ranging
between 1.95% and 2.25%, a considerable
reduction on the margins of the previous facilities,
which had margins of 2.7%. The new facilities
provide adequate operating headroom until
January 2018.
At 30 November 2013, the Group had £7.6 million
of unused loan facilities (2012: £1.0 million of
unused facilities), an unutilised overdraft facility 
of £2.5 million (2012: £2.5 million) and cash
balances of £6.8 million (2012: £7.3 million). 
The £1.4 million cash balance held as restricted
cash at 30 November 2012 was released in
March 2013.
Finance and treasury policy
The treasury function at Porvair is managed
centrally, under Board supervision. It is not a 
profit centre and does not undertake speculative
transactions. It seeks to limit the Group’s trading
exposure to currency movements. The Group
does not hedge against the impact of exchange
rate movements on the translation of profits and
losses of overseas operations.
At the year end, the Group had US$7.5 million
(2012: US$10.3 million) of US dollar borrowings
exposure which partially hedged underlying US
net assets on the balance sheet of US$39.9
million (2012: US$35.8 million).
The Group finances its operations through share
capital, retained profits and bank debt. It has
adequate facilities to finance its current operations
and capital plans for the foreseeable future.

Risk description and impact
Existing market risk
The Group serves the needs of a range of specialist filtration
markets, such that it is not dependent upon any one market.
However, its activities are spread across four key markets as
follows: 
• aviation filtration, where quality and accreditation of products 
are critical;
• energy and industrial process filtration, where projects tend 
to be large and demand would be affected by a sustained
economic downturn;
• environmental laboratory supplies, where revenue can be affected
by access to capital in customers’ markets (municipal/utilities 
and industrial labs); and
• aluminium filtration, where demand for aluminium can fluctuate.
Each of the above markets contribute more than 10% of the
Group’s revenue and the Group would be exposed to a significant
decline in any of these markets.
Mitigation Change
No single market represents more than 30% of revenue. Many of 
the Group’s products are consumable and are essential to the safe
operation of their respective systems and processes, so whilst
volumes are impacted by changes in economic circumstances,
significant fluctuations for other reasons are rare. 
The aviation market has traditionally provided very steady business
as product cycles are long and the Group offers a broad range of
products split evenly between after-market and new build. The
outlook for the aviation market is for steady growth and the Group
has a good pipeline of new long term supply contracts. There is
unlikely to be such a rapid decline in aerospace demand that the
Group could not manage the consequences over time.  
The energy and industrial process products serve a range of
customers who use filters as an integral part of processes in their
plants. Sales are both for new build and after market spares.  
Environmental laboratory supplies are chiefly sold to laboratories
engaged in meeting the regulatory requirements for clean water.  
It is expected that the regulated nature of this market will mitigate
cyclical changes. This market is expected to grow as water
regulations tighten throughout the world and demand for clean 
water in the developing world increases. The Group is steadily
increasing its consumable revenue into this market and reducing 
its reliance on original equipment sales. 
The Group’s revenue is affected by the levels of aluminium
production. However, the Group now has a stronger market 
position having successfully converted its customers to a new filter
formulation. The production of aluminium is gradually moving to
larger smelters in regions of low cost energy. The Group is
developing its sales presence accordingly.

22 Porvair plc Annual Report & Accounts 2013
Risk description and impact
New products and markets risk
The Group invests significant amounts into the development of 
new products often driven either by environmental imperatives or
legislation. In the early stage of development there is a risk that 
these products will either not be adopted, or that the legislation 
or regulation will not develop as anticipated.
Mitigation Change
The Group’s new product development is focused on solving 
specific challenges identified by the Group’s customers. This focus
on specific developments improves the adoption rate of the Group’s
designs. The Group has brought a number of these products 
to market and is now less exposed to the risks associated with new
products. The Group maintains a close review of each of its major
developments and is not significantly exposed if the market for any
one product does not develop.
Risk description and impact
Large contracts risk
The Group currently has a number of large contracts for the
installation of filtration systems. The Group’s future results will be
affected by the outcome of these contracts and the potential future
revenue from the installations. Significant delays or engineering
challenges with these contracts could impact the Group’s expected
performance. 
Mitigation Change
These contracts have direct senior management involvement on 
a day to day basis. The Group makes every effort to ensure that 
its commitments are met on time and in full. Detailed engineering
and financial plans, risk assessments and forecasts are maintained
for each of these projects. The financial impact of reasonably
foreseeable risks are included in these plans. Reports are
produced every month which detail project progress and 
changes to planned schedules and assessment of risk.
Risk description and impact
Raw materials, resources and facilities risk
The Group uses raw materials in its production processes. 
Prices for these raw materials can be volatile and are affected by 
the cyclical movement in commodity prices such as oil, alumina, 
gas and steel. The Group’s ability to pass on these price fluctuations
to its customers is to some extent dependent on the contracts it 
has entered into and the prevailing market conditions. There may be
times when the Group’s results are adversely affected by an inability
to recover increases in raw material prices. 
The Group operates a number of production facilities, the largest
facility generating approximately one third of the Group’s revenue. 
A disaster, such as a fire or flood, at any of the Group’s facilities 
could have a material impact on the Group’s performance.  
Mitigation Change
Where practical the Group seeks to fix its raw materials prices in 
long term contracts with suppliers and in certain cases uses forward
contracts to manage its exposure to fluctuating prices.
The Group maintains insurance of its equipment and facilities and
carries business interruption insurance to cover loss of profits. In
addition, the Group has ISO 9001 and other industry specific quality
control systems which reduce the risk that a disaster will occur.
Risk description and impact
Competitive risk
Porvair operates in competitive global markets. The Group’s
achievement of its objectives is reliant on its ability to respond 
to many competitive factors including, but not limited to, pricing,
technological innovations, product quality, customer service,
manufacturing capabilities and the employment of qualified personnel.
If the Group does not continue to compete in its markets effectively
by developing innovative solutions for its customers and delivering
high quality customer service, it could lose its customers and its
results could be adversely affected.
Mitigation Change
The Group recognises that certain of its competitors are larger and
have greater financial resources. This may enable them to deliver
products on more attractive terms than the Group or to invest more
resources, including research and development.
Through the development of a strategy that focuses on micro
niches within the Group’s chosen markets, the Group seeks 
to identify specific opportunities where it has a commercial,
reputational or technological advantage that enables it to 
compete successfully.

Risk description and impact
Technological risk
Porvair has a broad portfolio of products delivered to a diverse range
of markets. The Group’s business could be affected if it does not
continue to win new mandates for filtration solutions with designs
that provide technical or cost advantages over its competitors.
Mitigation Change
The design and testing cycle of many of the Group’s products takes
several years before a product is accepted by the customer. Once
the product is accepted, and production commences, products
often have a very long lifecycle. The Group therefore has good
visibility of its pipeline of opportunities for revenue growth. However,
the ultimate commercial success of a project can often only be
judged when the development cycle is close to completion.
Risk description and impact
Financing risk
The Group maintains a level of borrowing to finance its operations.
Damage to, or loss of, its banking relationships could have a material
impact on the profitability of the Group. 
Mitigation Change
To mitigate this risk, the Group has sufficient long-term facilities in
place for its expected requirements and has progressively reduced
its gearing. It maintains a close relationship with its bankers and
carefully monitors the restrictions on its borrowings.  
Risk description and impact
Pensions risk
The Group operates a defined benefit pension scheme which 
is closed to new members but remains open for future accrual 
for the existing active members. The Group retains the ultimate
responsibility for ensuring that the trust has sufficient funds to ensure
that all current and future pensions can be paid in full. A significant
shortfall in the value of the assets of the scheme compared with its
liabilities could require the Company to make additional payments 
to the scheme.
Mitigation Change
The Pension scheme is financed through a separate trust fund 
and administered by a Board of Trustees with an independent
Chairman. The Group maintains a close oversight of the pension
scheme through appointment of its own trustees to ensure that 
the scheme is properly administered and that sound investment
advice is obtained. The Group has a deficit recovery plan in place
that is affordable and expected to reduce the current deficit. 
The deficit contribution is reviewed every three years as part of 
the triennial valuation.

Acquisitions risk
The Group is actively involved in searching for complementary
acquisitions. A poorly executed acquisition could weaken the Group.
Mitigation Change
The Group engages in thorough due diligence on its target
companies and adopts a cautious approach in its selection and
completion of acquisitions.
Risk description and impact
Product liability risk
The Group manufactures products that are potentially vital to the safe
operation of its customers’ products or processes. A failure of the
Group’s products could expose the Group to loss as a result of claims
made by the Group’s customers or users of their products.  
Mitigation Change
The Group seeks to minimise liabilities through limitations of liability 
in its contracts and carries insurance cover in the event that claims
are made.

Financial risk management
The Group’s operations expose it to a variety of financial risks that
include the effects of:
• price risk; 
• foreign exchange risk; 
• credit risk; 
• liquidity risk; and
• interest rate cash flow risk.
Mitigation Change
The Group has in place financial risk management procedures 
that seek to limit the adverse effects on the financial performance 
of financial risks. The principal procedures are described below:
Price risk
The Group is exposed to commodity price risk as a result of its
operations. The Group buys certain raw materials and energy 
on long term contracts to minimise its exposure to fluctuation in
commodity prices. In all cases these contracts result in the ultimate
delivery and use by the Group of the commodity. The Group has 
no exposure to equity securities price risk as it holds no listed 
or other equity investments.
Foreign exchange risk
The Group seeks to manage its exposure to the impact of 
exchange rate movements on its net investments by maintaining
some borrowings in US dollars. Previously it sought to maintain
borrowings in US dollars equivalent to around 60% of the carrying
value of its US dollar net tangible assets in its US operations.
However, as the Group’s overall borrowings have reduced, so 
the US dollar borrowings have reduced to around 15% of its 
US dollar net assets.
The UK operations of the business generate significant revenues 
in US dollars and the Group seeks to minimise the impact of
movements in the US dollar exchange rate on the value of these 
US dollar flows by using financial instruments to fix the future value
of the US dollars. The Group does not apply hedge accounting 
to these transactions. In the case of large contracts where the 
future currency income is in a different currency from the operations
functional currency, is certain, and can be specifically assigned 
to individual transactions, the Group takes out forward foreign
exchange contracts to minimise the impact of currency fluctuations.
The Group applies hedge accounting to these transactions.
Credit risk
The Group has implemented policies that require appropriate 
credit checks on potential customers before sales are made. 
Debtor finance is very rarely used and is reviewed on a case by 
case basis by the Board of Directors. The Group monitors the level
of deposits held with overseas banks and financial institutions and
repatriates cash as part of its treasury management.
Liquidity risk
The Group actively maintains a mixture of long term and short term
debt finance that is designed to ensure the Group has sufficient
available funds for operations and planned expansions.
Interest rate cash flow risk
The Group has only interest bearing liabilities. The Group seeks 
to maintain between 40% and 60% of its borrowings at a fixed
interest rate, typically through fixed rate swap agreements. 
The Group applies hedge accounting to these instruments.
As a result of the significant decline in the Group’s borrowings in 
the year, the Group has approximately 75% of its gross borrowings
held at a fixed rate at 30 November 2013, however the fixed rate
contracts expired shortly after the year end. For the time being, while
the Group’s gross borrowings are low, the Board has concluded 
that further interest rate swaps need not be taken out and the
Group’s borrowings are at a floating rate from 13 December 2013.

Managing our business
responsibly
Policy
The Board’s policy is to enhance shareholder
value in an ethical and socially responsible
manner. The Board believes that operating
efﬁciently with high quality standards includes
promoting high standards of health and safety
and helping to protect the environment. As a
minimum, the Group operations are required 
to meet the legal and regulatory requirements
of operating in their local jurisdiction.
Employment
Porvair prides itself on its staff and their 
ability to provide innovative solutions for its
customers. Porvair is committed to employing
talented people and enabling them to reach
their full potential. Porvair provides employment
in a wide range of disciplines associated with
the design and manufacture of ﬁltration and
separation equipment.
The Group involves employees through 
both formal and informal systems of
communication and consultation. Managers
have a responsibility to communicate effectively
and to promote a better understanding by
employees of the activities and performance 
of the Group. Information relating to trading,
company strategy and any other matters of
signiﬁcance are communicated to all
employees through local brieﬁngs.
It is the Group’s policy to recruit,train,promote
and treat all personnel on grounds solely 
based on individual ability and performance.
These principles are applied regardless of sex,
sexual orientation, religion, age, nationality or
ethnic origin.
The Group’s split between male and female
employees is shown below:
Female Male Total
Directors –5 5
Senior managers 
(statutory directors of 
subsidiary entities) – 16 16
Employees 179 437 616

Applications for employment by disabled
persons are always considered in full, bearing
in mind the respective aptitudes and abilities 
of the applicant concerned. In the event of
members of staff becoming disabled, every
effort is made to ensure that their employment
with the Group continues and the appropriate
training is arranged. It is the policy of the 
Group that the training, career development
and promotion of a disabled person should, 
so far as possible, be identical to that of all
other employees.
Health and safety
The Group recognises its clear responsibilities
for the health and safety of its employees 
and to the communities in which the Group
operates. By managing and controlling health
and safety, and reducing accidents and injuries,
the Group benefits from increased productivity,
lower absenteeism, reduced insurance and
healthcare premiums and ultimately a safety
record which holds the Group in good stead 
for securing future projects.
Health and safety responsibility is delegated 
to senior managers within each business.
These officers perform regular reviews and
inspect the conditions in which the Group’s
employees work. Discretionary health and
safety benefits for employees include the
availability of gyms and onsite nursing and
counseling staff at certain operations. The
Group’s regular reporting procedures include 
a review of accidents in the workplace.
The Group’s insurers and insurance brokers
carry out a rolling programme of reviews of 
the Group’s operations as part of their risk
assessments and the recommendations of the
consultants are generally implemented in full.
Health and safety achievements in the year
have included:
• An IOSH (Institution of Occupational Safety
and Health) accredited training program 
has been launched this year to develop
knowledge of modern health and safety
management techniques. The training which
is mandatory is being rolled out to all our 
UK managers over the next 12 months with
the aim of:
– Creating and encouraging common
standards for health and safety across 
all of our UK sites and operations;
– Developing employee involvement in 
health and safety programs; and 
– Improving Group health and safety
communications and information sources. 
Summary
• The Board’s policy is to
enhance shareholder value
in an ethical and socially
responsible manner.

• In the Metals Filtration business the safety
leadership team has been strengthened 
and safety improvement highlights include: 
– Improved factory layouts to separate forklift
trucks and pedestrians;
– Improved safety clothing for all employees
who are required to do electrical work;
– New systems to replace manual handling 
of furnace carts and raw materials; and
– Defensive driver training for the sales team.
The environment
Many of the products developed by Porvair 
are used to the benefit of the environment.
Examples include:
• Seal water analysis equipment, which is
used, inter alia, to ensure drinking water is fit
for consumption, and to analyse sea and river
water for signs of pollution or changes to
normal mineral composition; 
• The patented Selee CSX™ aluminium filter,
which is manufactured without phosphates 
or ceramic fibres, has other improved filtration
and manual handling benefits over competitor
products; and 
• The Group’s nuclear filters, which have 
been fitted to a range of demonstration 
plants being assessed as part of the
decontamination and decommissioning work
being carried out at the major US and UK
nuclear waste sites. 
This year the Group has begun to introduce
filters which will filter lithium alloys. These alloys
are less dense and stronger than aluminium
and will allow aircraft of the future to be made
lighter and more fuel efficient.
The Group consistently considers methods 
of improving its environmental profile.
Environmental impacts are managed in
conformity with local regulatory requirements.
The Group’s manufacturing processes have
only a limited potential emissions impact. The
Group uses solvents in certain of its processes,
and has procedures in place for their control,
and its Metals Filtration division manages the
emissions from its kiln firing operations within
agreed regulatory parameters.
Greenhouse gas emissions
The Group has implemented the UK
Government’s Guidance on measuring and
reporting greenhouse gas emissions, in line
with DEFRA guidelines, using conversion units
published by the Carbon Trust. The Group
reports ‘Scope 1 and 2’ emissions in tonnes 
of carbon dioxide. Scope 1 covers direct
emissions: those that emanate directly from
Group operations. This is principally natural gas
burned in manufacturing and fuel used in
company owned vehicles. Scope 2 covers
indirect emissions, those generated by key
suppliers, which is principally electricity.
Metals Filtration in the US runs gas powered
furnaces to fire its ceramic filters. The gas to
run these furnaces is the largest component 
of the Group’s emissions. Electricity provides
heat, light and power for the Group’s premises
and other plant and equipment. The plant 
and equipment is mainly light manufacturing
equipment but does include some high
pressure presses and electric furnaces.
2010 is used as a base year and 'kilogrammes
of CO2 emission per Pound Sterling of revenue’
as a measure of intensity. The Group aims to
reduce its total intensity ratio over time.

Relationships with customers
The Group’s products are generally bespoke
for specific customers and generally have a
very long product lifecycle. This naturally
requires the Group to build close relationships
with its customers. Over 80% of the Group’s
annual revenue comes from repeat business
from existing customers.
Most new product introductions are developed
with existing customers and when new
customers are gained it is often after a long
development period over which a close
relationship has developed and a long term
relationship is expected.
Particularly in aerospace and energy, the 
Group builds relationships with the immediate
customer for the product and also with the
ultimate end user or manufacturer, who is often
the party that certifies the product. For example
the airframe manufacturer will be an important
stakeholder but the customer will usually be 
a sub-assembly manufacturer.
Relationships with suppliers
The Group has an extensive network of
suppliers and sub-contractors, many of whom
are critical to the manufacture of specific parts.
The Group has a stable supplier base. It seeks
to increase its supplier base by extending the
number of suppliers only where there are
perceived to be risks of under capacity or
resilience in its existing supply chain. Suppliers
are generally only removed from the approved
list for persistent quality or delivery failures.
Wherever possible, the Group seeks local
suppliers to fulfil its requirements. The Group
carefully selects its suppliers. As part of building
a long term relationship with its critical suppliers,
the Group works closely with them to ensure
that the quality and delivery standards required
by the Group are achieved.
Anti-bribery and corruption policy
The Group seeks to prohibit all forms of bribery
and corruption within its business and complies
with the requirements of all applicable laws
designed to combat bribery and corruption.
The Group requires all employees, agents,
intermediaries and consultants to conduct
themselves in accordance with our anti-bribery
and corruption policy.
Porvair and the local community
The management of each operation is aware 
of its role within its local communities. They
seek to recruit locally and retain a skilled local
workforce and are encouraged to build
relationships with local community
organisations.
Human rights
The Group is aware of its requirements to
respect human rights in all jurisdictions in which
it operates. There has however never been 
a human rights issue that has had a direct
impact on the activities of the business and
accordingly the Group has nothing further 
to disclose.

Governance
Directors’ report
The Directors are pleased to present their Annual Report and
the audited accounts of the Group for the year ended 30
November 2013.
The Company
Porvair plc is a public limited company incorporated in England
and Wales and domiciled in the UK with a listing on the London
Stock Exchange under the symbol PRV . The address of its
registered office is 7 Regis Place, Bergen Way, King's Lynn,
Norfolk PE30 2JN.
Business review
The business review is covered in the Strategic report. 
The Group’s strategy, objectives, key performance indicators,
likely future developments and risks and uncertainties are
discussed throughout the report. 
Acquisitions
On 4 June 2013 the Group, through its subsidiary Porvair
Filtration Group Inc., purchased the goodwill, trade and 
assets of Eisenmann Metallurgical LLC. The trade is the
manufacture of specialist filters and is based in the USA. 
The total consideration is US$5,995,000 (£3,890,000);
US$3,995,000 (£2,582,000) was paid in the year ended 
30 November 2013, with further payments due up to 
4 June 2015.
On 20 September 2013 the Group, through its subsidiary 
Seal Analytical Inc., purchased the trade and assets of Thomas
Cain Inc., a manufacturer of environmental laboratory equipment
and consumables. Total consideration is up to US$1,987,000
(£1,241,000); US$1,087,000 (£679,000) was paid in the year
ended 30 November 2013 and the remaining US$900,000
(£562,000) is contingent upon achievement of agreed profit
performance in the year ending 30 November 2014.  
Dividends
An interim dividend of 1.1 pence per share (2012: 1.0 penny
per share) was paid on 6 September 2013. The Directors
recommend the payment of a final dividend of 1.8 pence 
per share (2012: 1.6 pence per share) on 6 June 2014 to
shareholders on the register on 2 May 2014; the ex-dividend
date is 30 April 2014. This makes a total dividend for the year
of 2.9 pence per share (2012: 2.6 pence per share).
Directors and their interests
The names and biographical details of the Directors are set 
out on page 28. Paul Dean, Charles Matthews, Ben Stocks,
Chris Tyler and Andrew Walker all served throughout the year.
Michael Gatenby retired from the Board at the Annual General
Meeting on 16 April 2013. Andrew Walker will retire from the
Board at the Annual General Meeting on 8 April 2014.
In accordance with best practice, it is the Board’s intention that
all Directors should offer themselves for re-election each year.
The appointment and replacement of Directors is governed 
by the Articles, the Companies Act 2006, the UK Corporate
Governance Code and related regulation and legislation
applying to UK listed companies. The Articles require there to
be a minimum of three Directors (and permit a maximum of 15)
and provide that the business of the Company shall be
managed by the Board of Directors which may exercise all
powers of the Company. The Board of Directors may make
such arrangements as they see fit to delegate those powers
except that the Board retains specific authority over the matters
reserved for the Board, which are summarised in the Board 
of Directors section in the Corporate Governance report on
page 33.
During the year, and up to the date of this report, the Group
maintained insurance providing liability cover for its Directors.
Details of all the beneficial and non-beneficial interests of the
Directors in the shares of the Company, share options and
service contracts are set out in the Remuneration Report on
pages 37 to 46. None of the Directors had a material interest 
in any contract of significance in relation to the Company 
or its subsidiaries during the year.
There are no agreements between the Company and its
Directors or employees that provide for compensation for 
loss of office or employment in the event of a takeover 
of the Company.
The Company has in place procedures to deal with conflicts 
of interest. The Company follows the guidance on conflicts 
of interest issued by the Association of General Counsel and
Company Secretaries of the FTSE.
Research and development
The Group continues to undertake a research and
development programme with the objective of identifying 
and developing new materials and products which have the
potential to transform the growth of the Group. The cost to 
the Group in the year under review was £3.2 million (2012: 
£3.1 million), which was written off to the income statement
and no development expenditure was capitalised in the year or
the preceding year. The expenditure is of a development nature
and is largely undertaken in-house rather than by third parties.
Greenhouse gas emissions
The disclosure of the Group’s greenhouse gas emissions is
given in the Corporate and social responsibility report on pages
26 and 27, which forms part of this report and is incorporated
into it by cross reference.
Share capital
The Company has one class of ordinary share capital which
carries no right to fixed income. All of the Company’s shares 
in issue are fully paid and each share carries the right to vote 
at general meetings of the Company. During the year, the
Company issued 1,121,026 shares to satisfy the exercise 
of share options.
Further details of the share capital of the Company are given 
in note 21 to the financial statements on page 74.
There are no specific restrictions on the size of a holding in 
the Company nor on the transfer of shares, which are both
governed by the provisions of the Articles and prevailing
regulation and legislation governing UK listed companies. 
The Directors are not aware of any agreements between
holders of the Company’s shares that may result in restrictions
on voting rights. No person has special rights of control over
the Company’s share capital.

Each year the Board seeks shareholder approval to renew the
Board’s authority to allot relevant securities and to purchase its
own shares.
Contracts
The Company is a party to a number of agreements that take
effect, alter or terminate upon a change of control of the
Company such as commercial contracts, banking agreements,
property lease arrangements and employee share plans.
Substantial shareholders
As at 24 January 2014, the Company has been notified of the
following substantial shareholdings, held indirectly, comprising
3% or more of the issued share capital of the Company.

Corporate governance
The disclosure requirements set out in the Disclosure and
Transparency rules, paragraph 7.2, are included within the
Corporate governance report on pages 33 to 35, which forms
part of this report and is incorporated into it by cross reference.
Employment policies
The Group’s employment policies are described in the
Corporate and social responsibility report on page 25, which
forms part of this report and is incorporated into it by cross
reference.
Financial risk management
The Group’s operations expose it to a variety of financial risks
that include the effects of price risk, foreign exchange risk,
credit risk, liquidity risk and interest rate cash flow risk. The
Group has in place risk management procedures that seek 
to limit the adverse effects on the financial performance 
of the Group of these financial risks.
Given the size of the Group, the Directors have not delegated
the responsibility of monitoring financial risk management to 
a sub-committee of the Board. The policies set by the Board 
of Directors are implemented by the Company’s finance
department, which has a policy and procedures manual that
sets out specific guidelines to manage interest rate risk and
credit risk and circumstances where it would be appropriate 
to use financial instruments to manage these.
Further details on the specific risks related to financial
management and their mitigation are given on pages 
21 to 24.
Going concern
After having made appropriate enquiries, including a review of
the Group’s budget for 2014, its medium term plans and taking
into account the available banking facilities, the Directors have 
a reasonable expectation that the Group and Company has
adequate resources to continue in operational existence for 
the foreseeable future. Accordingly, they continue to adopt the
going concern basis in preparing these accounts.
Annual General Meeting
The Annual General Meeting of the Company is to be held 
on Tuesday 8 April 2014. The notice for this meeting and 
proxy forms have been sent to shareholders separately. 
The resolutions are:
Resolution 1 – To receive the Company’s annual accounts 
for the year ended 30 November 2013.
Resolution 2 – Approval of the Directors’ remuneration report.
Resolution 3 – Approval of the Directors’ remuneration policy. 
The Remuneration Committee has presented a remuneration
policy which will bind the Company in its awards of remuneration
to the Directors until a new resolution is approved by
shareholders. A resolution will be put to shareholders at 
least every three years.
Resolution 4 – To approve the final dividend of 1.8 pence 
per share.
Resolutions 5 to 8 – All of the Directors, with the exception 
of Andrew Walker, offer themselves for re-election.

of the Annual Report.
Resolution 9 – Re-appointment of PricewaterhouseCoopers
LLP as auditors.
Resolutions 10 and 11 – Directors’ authority to allot 
shares (ordinary resolution) and disapply pre-emption rights
(special resolution).
Resolution 10 authorises the Directors to allot shares 
under section 551 of the Companies Act 2006. Paragraph 
11.1 gives the Directors customary authority to allot ordinary
shares or grant such subscription or conversion rights as are
contemplated by sections 551(1)(a) and (b) respectively of the
Companies Act 2006 up to an aggregate nominal amount 
of £291,557, being an amount equal to one third of the
Company’s issued share capital as at 24 January 2014. 
As at 24 January 2014, the Company did not hold any 
treasury shares. 
The authorities granted under Resolution 10 shall expire at the
next Annual General Meeting of the Company. Resolution 10
replaces a similar resolution passed at the Annual General
Meeting of the Company held on 16 April 2013.
If the Directors wish to allot shares or other equity securities for
cash or sell any shares which the Company holds in treasury,
following a purchase of its own shares pursuant to the authority
in Resolution 11, the Companies Act 2006 requires that such
shares or other equity securities are offered first to existing
shareholders in proportion to their existing holding. Resolution
11 asks shareholders to grant the Directors authority to allot
equity securities or sell treasury shares for cash up to an
aggregate nominal value of £43,733 (being 5% of the
Company’s issued ordinary share capital as at 24 January
2014), without first offering the securities to existing
shareholders. The resolution also disapplies the statutory

pre-emption provisions in connection with a rights issue and
allows the Directors, in the case of a rights issue, to make
appropriate arrangements in relation to fractional entitlements
or other legal or practical problems which might arise. The
Directors confirm that they do not intend to issue in excess 
of 7.5% of the Company’s issued ordinary share capital within
any rolling three year period without prior consultation with
shareholders. The authority will expire at the next Annual
General Meeting of the Company.
Resolution 12 – Purchases of own shares by the Company
(special resolution).
Resolution 12 to be proposed at the Annual General Meeting
seeks authority from shareholders for the Company to make
market purchases of its own ordinary shares, such authority
being limited to the purchase of 10% of the ordinary shares in
issue as at 24 January 2014. The maximum price payable for
the purchase by the Company of its own ordinary shares will be
limited to the higher of (i) 5% above the average of the middle
market quotations of the Company’s ordinary shares, as derived
from the Daily Official List of the London Stock Exchange, for
the five business days prior to the purchase and (ii) the higher 
of the price of the last independent trade of an ordinary share
and the highest current independent bid for an ordinary share
as derived from the London Stock Exchange Trading System
SETS. The minimum price payable by the Company for the
purchase of its own ordinary shares will be 2 pence per share
(being the nominal value of an ordinary share). The authority 
to purchase the Company’s own ordinary shares will only be
exercised if the Directors consider that there is likely to be a
beneficial impact on earnings per ordinary share and that it is 
in the best interests of the Company at the time. The resolution
renews a similar resolution passed at the Annual General
Meeting of the Company held on 16 April 2013. Any ordinary
shares so purchased by the Company will be held in treasury
by the Company and will remain in issue and be capable of
being re-sold by the Company or used in connection with
certain of its share schemes.
To understand the impact of dilution, options to subscribe for
up to 1,613,544 ordinary shares have been granted and are
outstanding as at 24 January 2014 (being the latest practicable
date prior to publication of this document) which if issued
would represent 3.6% of the issued ordinary share capital at
that date. If the Directors were to exercise in full the power for
which they are seeking authority under Resolution 13 the
options outstanding as at 24 January 2014 would represent
3.9% of the ordinary share capital (excluding shares held in
treasury) in issue following such exercise.
Resolution 13 – Calling of general meetings 
(special resolution).
Resolution 13 to be proposed at the Annual General Meeting
seeks authority from shareholders to hold general meetings
(other than Annual General Meetings) on 14 days’ clear notice.
This is permissible under the Articles and the Companies Act
2006. However, pursuant to the EU Shareholders’s Rights
Directive, the Company must offer the facility, accessible to all
shareholders, to vote by electronic means and must obtain
specific shareholder approval on an annual basis to retain this
ability. The Directors believe that there may be circumstances 
in which it will be in the interests of the Company to be able to
convene meetings at such short notice. The shorter notice
period would not be used as a matter of course, but only
where it is merited by the business of the meeting and is
thought to be to the advantage of the shareholders as a whole.
Accordingly, the Directors believe that it is important for the
Company to retain this flexibility. Resolution 13 renews a similar
resolution passed at the Annual General Meeting of the
Company held on 16 April 2013.
Resolution 14 – To establish a new Save As You Earn
(“SAYE”) scheme.
Resolution 14 to be proposed at the Annual General Meeting
seeks to reintroduce an HM Revenue & Customs approved
SAYE scheme. The existing SAYE scheme that was
implemented in 2003 expired in 2013. The scheme was
implemented to incentivise and reward all employees. It is
proposed that a new SAYE plan be implemented to enable 
all UK employees to benefit from the future growth and 
success of the Company.
Statement of Directors’ responsibilities 
The Directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report,
the Remuneration Report and the financial statements in
accordance with applicable law and regulations.
Company law requires the Directors to prepare financial
statements for each financial year. Under that law the Directors
have prepared the Group financial statements in accordance
with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as
adopted by the European Union, and the parent company
financial statements in accordance with United Kingdom
Generally Accepted Accounting Practice (United Kingdom
Accounting Standards and applicable law). Under company law
the Directors must not approve the financial statements unless
they are satisfied that they give a true and fair view of the state
of affairs of the Group and the Company and of the profit or
loss of the Group for that period. In preparing these financial
statements, the Directors are required to:
• select suitable accounting policies and then apply them
consistently; 
• make judgements and accounting estimates that are
reasonable and prudent; 
• state whether IFRSs as adopted by the European Union and
applicable UK Accounting Standards have been followed,
subject to any material departures disclosed and explained 
in the Group and parent company financial statements
respectively; and 
• prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis
unless it is inappropriate to presume that the Company will
continue in business. 
The Directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting
records that are sufficient to show and explain the Company’s
transactions and disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time
the financial position of the Company and the Group and
enable them to ensure that the financial statements and the
Remuneration Report comply with the Companies Act 2006
and, as regards the Group financial statements, Article 4 of the
IAS Regulation. They are also responsible for safeguarding the
assets of the Company and the Group and hence for taking
reasonable steps for the prevention and detection of fraud and
other irregularities.
Covs 1-36, 92 tp_Layout 1  03/03/2014  13:45  Page 34 The Directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity
of the Company’s website. Legislation in the United Kingdom
governing the preparation and dissemination of financial
statements may differ from legislation in other jurisdictions.  
The work carried out by the auditors does not involve
consideration of these matters and, accordingly, the auditors
accept no responsibility for any changes that may have
occurred to the financial statements since they were initially
presented on the website. 
The Directors consider that the annual report and accounts,
taken as a whole, is fair, balanced and understandable and
provides the information necessary for shareholders to assess
the Company’s performance, business model and strategy.  
Each of the Directors, whose names and functions are listed 
on page 28, confirm that to the best of their knowledge:
• the Group financial statements, which have been prepared in
accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the EU, give a true and
fair view of the assets, liabilities, financial position and profit 
of the Group; and
• the Chairman’s statement, the Chief Executive’s report, the
Finance Director’s review and the Directors’ report, when
taken together, include a fair review of the development and
performance of the business and the position of the Group,
together with a description of the principal risks and
uncertainties that it faces.
Directors’ responsibility for provision of information 
to the auditors
So far as each Director is aware there is no relevant audit
information of which the Company’s auditors are unaware.
Each Director has taken all the steps that he ought to have
taken as a Director in order to make himself aware of any
relevant audit information and to establish that the Company’s
auditors are aware of that information.
Independent auditors
PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP have indicated their willingness
to continue in office and a resolution concerning their 
re-appointment will be put to the Annual General Meeting.

Directors’ report continued
Covs 1-36, 92 tp_Layout 1  03/03/2014  13:45  Page 35 Compliance
The following sets out the main principles of good governance
in the 2012 UK Corporate Governance Code that have been
followed by the Board and how those principles have been
applied. The Directors are of the opinion that the Company has
complied with the provisions of the UK Corporate Governance
Code (which is publicly available at www.frc.org) throughout the
year except where explicitly set out below.
Role of the Board
The Group is directed and controlled by the Board. It provides
strategic leadership and support with the aim of developing the
business profitably, whilst at the same time assessing and
managing the associated risks. The Board ensures that the
financial management, controls and resources are in place to
enable the business to meet its objectives. The Directors take
collective responsibility for the Group’s performance.
The Board has a fixed schedule for reviewing the Group’s
operating performance and has other specific responsibilities
reserved to it, which include:
• Approval of the published financial results and dividends; 
• Appointments to the Board and other Board committees; 
• Approval of the strategic direction of the business; 
• Approval of expenditure over certain limits; 
• Approval for acquisitions and disposals; 
• Approval of treasury policy and significant new financing; and 
• Approval of the funding policies of the defined benefit 
pension scheme. 
The Executive Directors manage the day to day operations 
of the business within the framework set out by the Board.
Outside the formal schedule of Board meetings the Chairman
and Non-Executive Directors make themselves available for
consultation with the Executive team as necessary.
The Board has a schedule of seven pre-arranged meetings
during the year. In addition, such other meetings as are required
are arranged to deal with specific issues or transactions. 
During the year there was full attendance at all pre-arranged
Board meetings.
The Board undertook a rigorous self assessment review during
the year to consider its own performance. The procedures
included individual interviews by the Chairman with each
Director, completion of an assessment form and discussion 
of the findings at a Board meeting. The Senior Independent
Non-Executive Director maintains regular contact with the 
other Independent Non-Executive Directors and the Executive
Directors, sufficient to monitor the performance of the
Chairman. The Chairman, in consultation with the Executive
Directors, monitors the performance of the Non-Executive
Directors.
Board of Directors
The Board consists of five Directors; two Executive Directors
and three Non-Executive Directors, including the Chairman.
The Board is chaired by Charles Matthews. Ben Stocks is the
Group Chief Executive and Chris Tyler is the Group Finance
Director. Paul Dean, Charles Matthews and Andrew Walker 
are Independent Non-Executive Directors. Andrew Walker is
the Senior Independent Non-Executive Director. The Board
considers that Charles Matthews continues to be an
Independent Non-Executive Director after his appointment 
as Chairman.
The Directors’ appointment and removal is a matter for the
Board as a whole. The Senior Non-Executive Director is
available for consultation with shareholders through the
Company Secretary, by written submission. The Executive
Directors and the Chairman have met with the Company’s
major shareholders and other potential investors on a regular
basis and have reported to the Board on those meetings.
The Non-Executive Directors’ terms of appointment do not
specify a specific period for their appointment and therefore 
the terms are not in compliance with provision B.2.3 of the 
UK Corporate Governance Code. However, in accordance 
with best practice all of the Directors offer themselves for 
re-election at each Annual General Meeting. All newly
appointed Directors offer themselves for election at the first
Annual General Meeting following their appointment. The
Chairman considers that, following the application of the
Board’s formal performance evaluation programme, each
Director’s performance continues to be effective and each
Director has demonstrated commitment to his role. 
On joining the Board a new Director receives appropriate
induction including meeting with other Directors, visiting 
the Group’s principal operations and meeting with senior
management and the Group’s principal advisers.
The Board has put in place a procedure by which any 
Director may take independent professional advice at the
expense of the Company in furtherance of his duties as 
a Director of the Company.
The Company maintains Directors’ and Officers’ 
liability insurance.

Board Committees
Audit Committee
The Board has established an Audit Committee to review 
and advise the Board on matters relating to the internal controls
and financial reporting of the Group.  
The Audit Committee currently comprises all of the Independent
Non-Executive Directors of the Company. The Chairman of 
the Audit Committee is Paul Dean, who succeeded Michael
Gatenby following the Annual General Meeting in April 2013.
The Committee includes Charles Matthews, the Chairman of
the Company. The Board considers that all members of the
Audit Committee have recent and relevant financial experience
to enable it to discharge its function.
The Report of the Audit Committee on page 36 includes 
details of the audit committee’s remit, scope of work in the 
year and related judgments.
The Audit Committee met four times during the year. 
There was full attendance by the members.
The Audit Committee’s full terms of reference are available 
on the Group’s website, www.porvair.com.
Remuneration Committee
The Remuneration Committee determines and recommends to
the Board the framework or broad policy for the remuneration
and long term incentive arrangements of the Company’s
Executive Directors. The Remuneration Committee comprises
all of the independent Non-Executive Directors of the
Company. Andrew Walker is the Chairman of the Committee.
The Group Chief Executive may be invited to attend and 
speak at meetings of the Remuneration Committee, but 
does not participate in any matter which impacts upon his 
own remuneration arrangements. The remuneration of the 
Non-Executive Directors, including the Chairman, is set by 
the Executive Directors.
The Remuneration Report on pages 37 to 46 includes details 
on remuneration policy, practices and the remuneration 
of the Directors.
The Remuneration Committee met twice during the year 
and was fully attended by all of its members.  
The Remuneration Committee’s full terms of reference are
available on the Group’s website, www.porvair.com.
Nomination Committee
The Company’s Nomination Committee provides a transparent
process and procedure for the appointment of new Directors 
to the Board. The Nomination Committee comprises all of the
Non-Executive Directors and is chaired by the Chairman of the
Company. The Nomination Committee’s responsibilities include:
• identifying and nominating candidates to fill Board vacancies; 
• evaluating the balance of skills, knowledge and experience on
the Board and the leadership needs of the organisation; and 
• succession planning. 
The Company recognises the importance of diversity, including
gender, on the Board and throughout the executive functions
within the business.
The Nomination Committee did not meet during the year. 
The Group’s leadership and succession planning was
considered in a meeting of the full Board.
The Nomination Committee’s full terms of reference are
available on the Group’s website, www.porvair.com.
Takeover Directive
Disclosures relating to the Takeover Directive are included in 
the Directors’ Report (under “Share capital”) on page 29.
Internal control
The Turnbull Guidance issued in 2005 gives guidance for
directors on reviewing internal controls and reporting. The
Company has complied in full throughout the year, and up 
to the date the financial statements were approved, with the
recommendations of the Turnbull Guidance.
The Board has overall responsibility for ensuring that the Group
maintains a system of internal controls and for reviewing its
effectiveness. The system is not designed to eliminate the risk
that the Group’s objectives will not be achieved but to ensure
that there is an ongoing process for identifying, evaluating and
managing the significant risks. As with any such system, it can
only provide reasonable, but not absolute, assurance against
material misstatement or loss. The Board has reviewed the
effectiveness of the process regularly throughout the year. 
The Group’s key procedures are as follows:
Control environment – each operating business has its 
own management group which meets regularly to monitor
operational matters. Each operating business is responsible 
for establishing its own system of internal controls and for
ensuring compliance with those controls. The Managing
Director of each operating business reports to the Group 
Chief Executive, and clearly defined lines of responsibility

have been established within this organisational structure. 
The senior finance executive in each operation has a dual
responsibility to report within his operation to the Managing
Director and to the Group Finance Director. The Executive
Directors visit all operations regularly to perform 
detailed reviews.
Risk management – operating business management have 
a clear responsibility for the identification of risks facing each
operation, and for establishing procedures to investigate and
monitor such risks. The Board reviews a group register of risks
and mitigation on a regular basis as part of its normal Board
reporting. The Board also commissions independent reviews 
of the key risks facing the Group as appropriate.
Information and control systems – each operating business
maintains its own internal systems and controls designed to
provide management with regular and reliable management
information. The Group has a comprehensive process of annual
budgets and detailed monthly reporting. The annual budget of
each operating business and the consolidated Group budget
are approved by the Board as part of its normal responsibilities.
The Board receives copies of the monthly management
accounts for each month and the performance of the Group 
is reviewed in detail at each Board meeting.
Monitoring system – the Board has established a framework of
controls encompassing procedures applicable to all businesses
that are subject to executive review. The Group operates a 
self-assessment process so that the operating businesses can
quantify the extent of their compliance with control objectives.
This process is monitored by an internal audit cycle conducted
by peer review by the Group’s financial controllers directed by
the Group Finance Director. The Board considers that the peer
review process provides an appropriate level of review. The
Group has a formal whistle blowing procedure which gives
employees the opportunity to escalate their concerns,
ultimately to the Senior Non-Executive Director.
Consolidation process – full management accounts for 
each entity in the Group are consolidated each month and
review and analysis is carried out on those results. These
consolidated accounts form the basis of reports that are
provided to Board members every month.
The Audit Committee and the Board have reviewed the
effectiveness of the Group’s internal controls for the period 
1 December 2012 up to the date of approval of the Annual
Report and Accounts and have addressed issues as they 
have been identified.

Covs 1-36, 92 tp_Layout 1  03/03/2014  13:45  Page 38 Report of the Audit Committee
The Audit Committee has a formal timetable of 
meetings. Representatives of the Company’s auditors,
PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP , attend meetings by invitation.
Other employees of the Company may be invited to attend
meetings as and when required.
The Committee has a formal agenda, timetable and terms 
of reference. The Committee met four times in the year.
Two of those meetings were held prior to the Board meetings
to approve the announcement of the Group’s full year and
interim announcements to consider the ﬁnancial reporting
judgments made by the management. Its deliberations 
are informed by accounting papers and ﬁnancial reports
prepared by the management and reviews prepared by 
the Group’s auditors. 
The Committee’s signiﬁcant judgment in respect of the year
under review related to the forecasts adopted in the accounting
for large long-term contracts. Speciﬁcally, the Committee
considered whether the judgments used to forecast the
percentage completion and the costs to complete (including
provisions for rework costs and other contractual obligations) 
in each of the contracts were reasonable.
In addition, certain judgments, which are inherent to the
preparation of the ﬁnancial statements and are considered
each year, including the choice of an appropriate weighted
average cost of capital used in assessing whether goodwill is
impaired and the assumptions underlying the valuation of the
pension liabilities, were carefully considered by the Committee.
The Committee also reported to the Board that it considered
that, taken as a whole, the 2013 Annual Report was fair,
balanced and understandable and included the necessary
information to assess the performance, business model and
strategy of the Company.
In addition to its work reviewing the Group’s ﬁnancial
statements, the Committee has:
• monitored the Company’s internal ﬁnancial controls and the
Company’s internal control and risk management systems
and ensured that these are properly reviewed by the Group’s
management; 
• reviewed the scope of the internal audit work done in
reviewing the operating companies’ internal controls and
procedures. The internal audit work is undertaken through 
a system of peer reviews by the Group’s ﬁnance function.
The Committee considers the Group to be too small to 
justify a dedicated internal audit function;
• made recommendations to the Board in relation to the
appointment of the external auditor and approved the
remuneration and terms of engagement of the external
auditor; 
• monitored the external auditor’s effectiveness, independence
and objectivity. The Committee, in conjunction with the
management, considered: the robustness of the audit
process; the quality and timeliness of its delivery; the quality 
of the auditor’s staff and reporting; and its value for money;
• reviewed arrangements by which staff of the Company may
raise concerns about possible improprieties in matters of
ﬁnancial reporting or other matters;
• considered its own effectiveness and made
recommendations to the Board for improvements where
necessary; and
• reported to the Board on how it has discharged its
responsibilities.
The Audit Committee has set a policy which is intended to
maintain the independence and objectivity of the Company’s
auditors when acting as auditor of the Group accounts. The
policy governs the provision of audit and non-audit services
provided by the auditor and, in summary, requires signiﬁcant
non-audit related services to be subjected to a competitive
tendering process. The fees paid to the auditor for audit
services, audit related services and other non-audit services are
set out in note 3 of the consolidated ﬁnancial statements. The
audit has always been conducted by PricewaterhouseCoopers
LLP or its predecessor ﬁrms and has not been the subject of a
competitive tender. The Audit Committee do, however, carefully
consider the reappointment of the auditors each year prior to
making their recommendation to the shareholders. The auditors
are also engaged to provide a review of the Group’s interim
results and are auditors to the Group’s pension scheme.
During the course of the year, the Group reviewed the provision
of its tax services, which were previously provided by the
auditors. These services were put out to competitive tender
and the Group appointed Grant Thornton UK LLP to provide
them. There are no other signiﬁcant services provided by the
Group’s auditors.
The Audit Committee is authorised to engage the services 
of external advisers, as it deems necessary, at the Company’s
expense in order to carry out its function.
The Audit Committee’s full terms of reference are available 
on the Group’s website, www.porvair.com.
Statement by the Chairman of the Audit Committee
The Committee’s role is to assist the Board by reviewing:
the integrity of the Group’s ﬁnancial reporting; the quality 
of the external and internal audit review processes; the
appropriateness of the Group’s internal controls; and
compliance with a range of ﬁnancial, governance and 
other compliance issues.
New requirements this year require the Committee to
disclose the signiﬁcant accounting judgments it has
considered in the course of its review of the Annual report;
and to consider whether the Annual report is fair, balanced
and understandable.

Annual Report on Remuneration
This report complies with the UK Corporate Governance
Code published in September 2012 (the “UK Corporate
Governance Code”) and other relevant regulation, including
the Remuneration Regulations. It sets out the Group’s
remuneration policy and details of Directors’ remuneration.
A resolution to approve this report will be proposed at the
Annual General Meeting in April 2014.
The Committee
The members of the Remuneration Committee are drawn
solely from the independent Non-Executive Directors. To be
quorate the Committee is required to comprise at least two
members. During the year, the Committee comprised Paul
Dean, Michael Gatenby (until his resignation on 16 April
2013), Charles Matthews and Andrew Walker (Chairman). 
The Committee uses external published benchmark data to
guide its deliberations.
The Committee also has an advisory role in relation to major
changes in employee benefit structures throughout the
Company and the Group.
This part of the Remuneration Report has been audited.
Summary of Executive Directors’ remuneration packages
The Executive Directors’ remuneration packages consist of:
a base salary; a discretionary annual cash bonus earned for
the achievement of financial and non-financial objectives; the
grant of share options and long term incentives with three
year financial performance targets; and the provision of other
benefits comprising pension benefits, a cash allowance in lieu
of a company car, medical insurance and wellness benefits,
life insurance and permanent health insurance.
Annual Statement by the Chairman of the
Remuneration Committee (“the Committee”)
The Committee’s remit is to set policies and levels of
remuneration to encourage actions by management that
are in the long term interests of the Company and its
shareholders.
The Committee is responsible for determining:
• the framework for the remuneration of the Executive
Directors;
• the overall remuneration package of each Executive
Director including, if appropriate, bonuses, incentive
payments and share options;
• the targets for any performance related elements of the
Executive Directors’ remuneration;
• the policy for, and scope of, pension arrangements for
each Executive Director; and
• the terms of termination. This includes ensuring that:
any payments made are fair to the individual and the
Group; that failure is not rewarded; and that the duty to
mitigate loss is fully recognised.
The Company is now subject to new remuneration
reporting regulations (The Large and Medium-sized
Companies and Groups (Accounts and Reports)
(Amendment) Regulations 2013) (the “Remuneration
Regulations”), and this report therefore takes a different
form to previous years. In particular, the Remuneration
Regulations require the Company to present a
forward-looking remuneration policy setting out the
Company’s future policy on Directors’ remuneration
(including the Company’s approach to exit payments) and
certain additional disclosures regarding the Directors’
remuneration. The remuneration policy is subject to
shareholder approval and a resolution will be proposed at
the Company’s 2014 AGM to approve the policy. The
Remuneration Report, excluding the remuneration policy
report, remains subject to an advisory shareholder
approval as previously. 
During the year the Committee sought to:
• set Executive Directors’ remuneration at levels to
incentivise and reward excellent performance in line
with the long term interests of the Group and its staff
and shareholders;
• maintain a substantial proportion of total remuneration
as performance related;
• enable the Executive Directors, through excellent
performance, to attain and keep a substantial
shareholding in the business.

In 2013 the Executive Directors incurred PAYE tax and national insurance contributions amounting to £1,200,000 (2012: £352,000)
including amounts payable on the exercise of Long Term Incentive share options. In 2012 the Executive Directors did not
exercise any Long Term Incentive share options.
Benefits
Benefits for the Executive Directors comprise a cash allowance in lieu of a company car, medical insurance and wellness
benefits, life insurance and permanent health insurance. Life assurance benefits covering a lump sum of four times salary on
death in service and a 20% of salary spouse’s pension are provided through the Porvair Pension Plan. The Executive Directors
are covered by the Group’s permanent health insurance scheme.
Pension entitlements
The Porvair plc Pension and Death Benefit Plan (“the Plan”) is a contributory defined benefit scheme, which is now closed to new
employees. Pension benefits from the Plan were subject to the HMRC earnings cap and the Group has continued to maintain an
earnings cap since the HMRC limits were removed in April 2006. 
Pension benefits up to the capped limit of £138,000 were provided in the period for Ben Stocks by the Plan. Ben Stocks is
entitled to the same pension benefits from the Plan as all other members. The Plan has a normal retirement age of 65. Only basic
salary is pensionable. Ben Stocks was aged 51 on 30 November 2013. In the event that he retires early he may, at the discretion
of the Trustees of the Plan, apply to draw a reduced pension. There is no actuarial benefit to the individual to retiring early. Ben
Stocks also received a 15% contribution to a Self Invested Pension Plan (“SIPP”) on the difference between his full salary and the
capped limit covered by the Plan. 
Pension benefits were provided for Chris Tyler by a contribution of 15% of full salary to a SIPP .
Annual bonus
Bonus payments to Executive Directors are made at the discretion of the Committee for achievement of Group financial
performance targets and strategic objectives. In 2012 and 2013, awards were capped at 75% of base salary. Up to 60% may be
paid on achievement of financial performance targets and up to 15% on achievement of strategic objectives. Bonuses are not

In assessing the non-financial targets for 2013 the Committee noted that the key objective of securing two major contracts had
been achieved securing a 10% bonus and that delivery performance had improved but not to the level required for a full bonus
payout, so only a 2.5% bonus of the 5% available was paid.
In 2012, all financial performance targets were exceeded, but one strategic objective was not met. Accordingly, a bonus of 70%
of salary was awarded to the Executive Directors.

Vesting of long term share plan
2012 vesting
Options granted in 2010 under The Porvair Long Term Share Plan 2008 (the “2008 Scheme”) are exercisable in full if the Group
achieved earnings per share (“EPS”) of at least 11.0 pence in the financial year ended 30 November 2012 (“FY2012”). 30% of
the award vested if the Group achieved EPS of 7.4 pence in FY2012. 50% of the award vested if the Group achieved EPS of
8.0 pence in FY2012. A sliding scale operated if the EPS was between 8.0 pence and 11.0 pence. Accordingly, 92% of these
options vested as a result of the EPS performance in FY2012. The remaining options lapsed.
2013 vesting
Options granted in 2011 under the 2008 Scheme were exercisable in full if the Group achieved EPS of at least 12.5 pence per
share in the financial year ended 30 November 2013 (“FY2013”). 30% of the award vested if the Group achieved EPS of
8.0 pence in FY2013. 50% of the award vested if the Group achieved EPS of 9.5 pence in FY2013. A sliding scale operated if
the EPS was between 8.0 pence and 9.5 pence and between 9.5 pence and 12.5 pence. 100% of these options vested as a
result of the performance in the year.
Share options and long term incentive plan shares
Awards of share options and long term incentive plan shares are at the discretion of the Committee. 
The Company operates two discretionary share option plans:
• market priced options under The Porvair 2005 Unapproved Share Options Scheme (the ‘2005 Scheme’); and 
• nominal priced options under the 2008 Scheme. 
Both schemes provide options with a ten year life and are subject to vesting conditions after three years based on performance
conditions set by the Committee. 
The Company also periodically offers invitations to UK employees to join Save As You Earn (“SAYE”) schemes. Currently 
there is a three year and five year scheme running following an invitation in October 2011. 
The maximum number of shares that may be issued under the Company’s option schemes may not exceed 10% of the
Company’s issued share capital in any 10 year period. The maximum number of shares that may be issued under the 2005
scheme may not exceed 5% of the Company’s issued share capital in any 10 year period. 
The market price of the Company’s ordinary shares at 30 November 2013 was 278 pence (2012: 152 pence).
The range of market prices during the year was 153 pence to 298 pence.
Directors’ holdings in shares and share options
In awarding long term incentive shares to the Executive Directors, the Remuneration Committee encourages the Executive
Directors to build up a holding of shares in the Company. The Committee prefers Executive Directors to hold the equivalent of at
least the value of one year’s base salary in Porvair shares. After exercising options in April 2013 each of the Executive Directors
either met or exceeded this guideline from that date onwards.
The beneficial interests at 30 November 2013 and 30 November 2012 of the Directors and their connected persons in the
ordinary shares of the Company are shown below. There have been no changes in those interests up to the date of this report.

For performance over the three year period 2014-16, the Committee has decided that Ben Stocks will be awarded 110,700
2 pence options and Chris Tyler will be awarded 77,000 2 pence options under the 2008 Scheme.
The awards granted in 2012 and 2013 were calculated to equal approximately a year’s salary based on the share price at the
end of each financial year. The award to be granted after the publication of these results will be calculated to equal a year’s salary
for each executive Director based on the average share price over the final quarter of the financial year ended 30 November
2013. The 2008 Scheme provides options issued at the nominal value of the Company’s ordinary shares of 2 pence. The face
value of the grant is determined by the year end share price in 2011 and 2012 and average share price over the final quarter of
the financial year ended 30 November 2013 for the 2014 award.
Performance conditions of the unvested share options
Options granted in 2012 under the 2008 Scheme can only be exercised in full if the Committee is satisfied that in the financial
year ending 30 November 2014 (“FY2014”), the Group has achieved EPS of at least 14 pence. 30% of the award will vest if the
Group has achieved EPS of 9.0 pence in FY2014. 50% of the award will vest if the Group has achieved EPS of 11.0 pence in
FY2014. A sliding scale operates if the EPS is between 9.0 pence and 11.0 pence and between 11.0 pence and 14 pence.
No shares vest if the EPS for FY2014 is below 9.0 pence.
Options granted in 2013 under the 2008 Scheme can only be exercised in full if the Committee is satisfied that in the financial
year ending 30 November 2015 (“FY2015”), the Group has achieved EPS of at least 15.5 pence. 30% of the award will vest if
the Group has achieved EPS of 11.0 pence in FY2015. 50% of the award will vest if the Group has achieved EPS of 12.5 pence
in FY2015. A sliding scale operates if the EPS is between 11.0 pence and 12.5 pence and between 12.5 pence and 15.5 pence.
No shares vest if the EPS in FY2015 is below 11.0 pence.

The Committee intends to grant options in 2014, after publication of these results, under the 2008 Scheme, which can only be
exercised in full if the Committee is satisfied that in the financial year ending 30 November 2016 (“FY2016”), the Group has
achieved EPS of at least 18.0 pence. 30% of the award will vest if the Group has achieved EPS of 13.5 pence in FY2016. 50%
of the award will vest if the Group has achieved EPS of 15.0 pence in FY2016. A sliding scale will operate if the EPS is between
13.5 pence and 15.0 pence and between 15.0 pence and 18.0 pence. No shares vest if the EPS in FY2016 is below 13.5 pence.
The options granted under the SAYE scheme in 2011 were issued at a 20% discount to the market price at the date of grant.
These options have no performance conditions.

In 2013, options were exercised. The Executive Directors’ total gain on the exercise of options was £2.0 million before deduction
of income tax and national insurance. The Executive Directors sold only sufficient shares to fund the option acquisition costs and
the related income tax and national insurance costs. The remaining shares were retained. As a result of these option exercises
Ben Stocks and Chris Tyler’s holdings in shares in the Company increased by 306,700 shares and 187,200 shares respectively.
The Executive Directors did not exercise any share options in 2012.

Performance graph and table
The following graph charts total shareholder return against the FTSE SmallCap Index for the last three years. Given the size and
nature of the Group, the FTSE SmallCap Index is the logical comparator index.
The table below shows the total remuneration for the Chief Executive Officer and the percentages of the maximum awards of
performance related pay received over the past five years.

Ben Stocks received a basic salary increase of 2.0% (2012: 2.5%) on 1 December 2013. This salary rise was the same as the
general salary rise awarded to all other UK employees. The benefits and annual bonus limits for both Ben Stocks and all other
UK employees remained in line with the prior year except as adjusted by the underlying salary increase.
Relative importance of spend on pay
As required by the Remuneration Regulations, the table below compares total staff remuneration with the amounts paid in
dividends to shareholders and the profit after tax of the Group.
Statement of voting at the Annual General Meeting
A resolution to approve the report of the Remuneration Committee included in the 2012 Report and Accounts was passed by
the shareholders at the AGM on 16 April 2013. 99.78% of votes were cast in favour of the resolution. 0.22% of votes were cast
against the resolution and 16,806 votes were withheld.
Advisers to the Committee
During the year the Committee has reviewed published surveys of the remuneration of directors of similar sized companies but
has not taken specific advice from remuneration consultants.
The Committee received input into its decision making from reports prepared by the Executive Directors, none of whom were
present at any time when their own remuneration was being considered.

REMUNERATION POLICY 
The Committee’s remuneration policy will be subject to a vote at the Annual General Meeting. In this forward looking section on
pages 43 to 46 we describe our remuneration policies and potential future outcomes for each Executive Director. We also
describe our policy for rewarding Non-Executive Directors.
These policies and the individual elements of the reward package are reviewed each year to ensure that they remain in line with
good practice and support the delivery of the Group’s strategy. 
In formulating its policy the Committee has given full consideration to the requirements of Section D of the UK Corporate
Governance Code and the Remuneration Regulations.
The Committee aims to provide remuneration packages that:
• are competitive, but not excessive, and are designed to attract, retain and motivate managers of high quality to deliver
growth for the business;
• are aligned with shareholders’ interests and have a significant proportion of the potential remuneration linked to the short
and medium term performance of the business;
• include an element of the potential reward linked to personal performance; and
• encourage the Executive Directors to accumulate shares in the Company.

The table below summarises the main components of the existing remuneration package for Executive Directors.
The Remuneration Committee has set performance targets for the Long Term Share Plan based on stretching EPS growth as it
believes that this provides a reliably measurable target in line with the Group’s medium and long term objectives. The Committee
considers each year, as part of its awards process, whether this basis remains appropriate.
Estimate of the total future potential remuneration
The charts below set out estimates of the potential remuneration for each of the Executive Directors based on the current
remuneration packages. The assumptions included in each scenario are described below: 
• the Porvair share price is assumed to remain constant at the average of the last quarter’s share price

operating plan and strategic 
priorities for the year.
• Bonus payments include an element
based on the ﬁnancial performance
of the Group in the year and an
element based on the delivery of
strategic targets.
• The annual bonus is not pensionable
however, at the Executive Directors’
discretion, some or all of the bonus
may be sacriﬁced into a pension
scheme to which the Group adds
8% of the amount sacriﬁced.
• The bonus is paid after the
announcement of the Group’ s 
annual results.
• Financial: set by the Committee in 
line with near term priorities for the
Group – typically adjusted proﬁt
before tax or operating cash ﬂow.
• Strategic: two or three strategic 
targets based on the requirements
of the Group’ s annual or three year
operating plan.
• The maximum bonus payable is
75% of salary. 60% is based on
ﬁnancial performance measures 
and 15% is based on delivery of
strategic priorities. The minimum
payout is nil.

determines:
• the period of time over which
performance will be judged, 
usually three years as suggested 
by Schedule A of the UK Corporate
Governance code
• the number of shares to be awarded

Policy on Non-Executive Directors
The Non-Executive Directors receive letters of appointment with six month notice terms and are subject to annual re-election,
in common with the Executive Directors, in accordance with the best practice set out in the UK Corporate Governance Code
published in September 2012. The Executive Directors review the Non-Executive Directors’ annual fees with effect from 1 June
each year. They receive a fixed annual fee, which reflects their time commitment to the business and comparatives from similar
sized quoted companies. They do not participate in any share option scheme, bonus or pension arrangements.
The current scale of remuneration is:
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              £000

Engagement with shareholders
The Committee considers shareholder feedback received during the AGM and any other shareholder meetings as part of its
annual review of its remuneration policy. The Chairman of the Remuneration Committee is available, on request, to discuss
issues of remuneration with shareholders of the Group.
Where the Committee proposes to introduce new long term incentive plans, the Committee seeks the views of major
shareholders prior to seeking general shareholder approval at a general meeting.
There were no shareholder representations to the Company in 2013 in respect of Directors’ remuneration.
Relationship with employees pay 
All employees receive a salary, pension and benefit package with levels of salary commensurate with their responsibilities.
Executives throughout the Group participate in various bonus schemes designed to reward good performance in their
operations. 
The Committee takes into account proposed or agreed changes to employees’ pay and conditions as part of its review of the
remuneration of Executive Directors. Except in exceptional circumstances, this results in the annual pay increases awarded to
Executive Directors being broadly in line with increases applied to other UK employees. 
The Committee maintains an overview of the remuneration policies throughout the Group. It seeks to ensure that employees are
paid a market rate for their particular roles and that there is consistency in targets set where performance related pay might be
awarded. Employees are not consulted in the process of setting the policy for Executive Directors’ remuneration.

In the event that the Company recruits a new director (either from within the organisation or externally), when determining
appropriate remuneration arrangements, the Committee will take into consideration all relevant factors (including but not limited
to quantum, the type of remuneration being offered and the candidates’ background) to ensure that arrangements are in the
best interests of both the Company and its shareholders without paying more than is necessary to recruit a director of the
required calibre. The Committee would generally seek to align the remuneration package offered with the remuneration policy
outlined in the tables on page 44. 
In the first year of appointment, the Committee may offer additional remuneration arrangements that it considers appropriate and
necessary to recruit and retain the individual. Such remuneration may be made in the form of cash or share based awards which
may vest immediately or at a future point in time. Vesting may be subject to performance conditions selected by the Committee.
The Committee may make awards on appointing a director to “buy-out” remuneration arrangements forfeited on leaving a
previous employer. In doing so the Committee will take account of relevant factors including any performance conditions
attached to these awards, the form in which they were granted (e.g. cash or shares) and the time over which they would have
vested. Generally buy-out awards will be made on a comparable basis to those forfeited.
In the event of recruitment, the Committee may also grant awards to a new director under Listing Rule 9.4.2 which allows for the
granting of awards, specifically to facilitate, in unusual circumstances, the recruitment or retention of a director, without seeking
prior shareholder approval.
Service contracts and policy in respect of payments for loss of office
The Executive Directors have rolling contracts with the Company which can be terminated on giving twelve months’ notice.
This is considered to be an appropriate balance between flexibility and commitment on both parties.
Payments for loss of office will be determined by the Remuneration Committee based on the contractual entitlements of the
Director concerned under service contracts and the terms of the Long Term Share Plan. The particular circumstances of the
Director’s loss of office will determine whether mitigation of payments should apply and whether the payments that would
ordinarily be due under the discretionary annual bonus plan would be paid. 
All employee share plans
The Company also periodically offers invitations to UK employees to join Save As You Earn (“SAYE”) schemes. Currently 
there is a three year and five year scheme running following an invitation in October 2011. The Executive Directors are eligible to
join these schemes, the Non-Executive Directors are not. The 2003 SAYE Scheme has expired and a resolution will be put to
shareholders at the Annual General Meeting to introduce a new scheme, the Porvair plc SAYE Share Option Scheme 2014, on
substantially the same terms as the previous scheme.

A_RemunReport p37-46 tp_RF66104_P01_CLN  03/03/2014  13:40  Page 46 Report on the Group financial statements
Our opinion
In our opinion the Group financial statements:
• give a true and fair view of the state of the Group’s affairs as
at 30 November 2013 and of the Group’s profit and cash
flows for the year then ended;
• have been properly prepared in accordance with International
Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the
European Union; and
• have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of
the Companies Act 2006 and Article 4 of the IAS Regulation.
This opinion is to be read in the context of what we say below.
What we have audited
The Group financial statements, which are prepared by
Porvair plc, comprise:
• the Consolidated balance sheet as at 30 November 2013;
• the Consolidated income statement and statement of
comprehensive income for the year then ended;
• the Consolidated statement of changes in equity and
statement of cash flows for the year then ended; and
• the notes to the Consolidated financial statements, which
include a summary of significant accounting policies and
other explanatory information.
The financial reporting framework that has been applied in
their preparation comprises applicable law and IFRSs as
adopted by the European Union.
Certain disclosures required by the financial reporting
framework have been presented elsewhere in the Annual
Report and Accounts (the “Annual Report”), rather than in the
notes to the financial statements. These are cross-referenced
from the financial statements and are identified as audited.
What an audit of financial statements involves 
We conducted our audit in accordance with International
Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland) (‘ISAs (UK & Ireland)’).
An audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts and
disclosures in the financial statements sufficient to give
reasonable assurance that the financial statements are free
from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or error.
This includes an assessment of:
• whether the accounting policies are appropriate to the
Group’s circumstances and have been consistently applied
and adequately disclosed;
• the reasonableness of significant accounting estimates
made by the directors; and 
• the overall presentation of the financial statements. 
In addition, we read all the financial and non-financial
information in the Annual Report to identify material
inconsistencies with the audited Group financial statements
and to identify any information that is apparently materially
incorrect based on, or materially inconsistent with, the
knowledge acquired by us in the course of performing 
the audit. If we become aware of any apparent material
misstatements or inconsistencies we consider the 
implications for our report.
Overview of our audit approach
Materiality
We set certain thresholds for materiality. These helped 
us to determine the nature, timing and extent of our audit
procedures and to evaluate the effect of misstatements, 
both individually and on the financial statements as a whole.
Based on our professional judgement, we determined
materiality for the Group financial statements as a whole to 
be £370,000, which represents, approximately, 5% of proﬁt
before tax.
We agreed with the Audit Committee that we would report 
to them misstatements identified during our audit above
£18,000 as well as misstatements below that amount that, 
in our view, warranted reporting for qualitative reasons.
Overview of the scope of our audit
The Group is structured along two business lines, being
Microfiltration and Metals Filtration, and has a number of
centralised functions. The Group financial statements are a
consolidation of 14 reporting units, comprising the Group’s
operating businesses within these business lines and the
centralised functions.
In establishing the overall approach to the Group audit, we
determined the type of work that needed to be performed at
the reporting units by us, as the Group engagement team, or
component auditors from other PwC network firms operating
under our instruction. Where the work was performed by
component auditors, we determined the level of involvement
we needed to have in the audit work at those reporting units
to be able to conclude whether sufﬁcient appropriate audit
evidence had been obtained as a basis for our opinion on the
Group ﬁnancial statements as a whole. 
Accordingly, of the Group's 14 reporting units, we identified 7,
which are based in the United Kingdom and United States of
America and which, in our view, required an audit of their
complete financial information due to their size. Specific audit
procedures on certain balances and transactions were
performed at the further 7 reporting units including operations
in the United States of America, Germany and China. This,
together with additional procedures performed at the Group
level, gave us the evidence we needed for our opinion on the
Group financial statements as a whole.
Areas of particular audit focus
In preparing the financial statements, the directors made 
a number of subjective judgements, for example in respect 
of significant accounting estimates that involved making
assumptions and considering future events that are inherently
uncertain. We primarily focused our work in these areas 
by assessing the directors’ judgements against available
evidence, forming our own judgements, and evaluating 
the disclosures in the financial statements.
In our audit, we tested and examined information, using
sampling and other auditing techniques, to the extent we
considered necessary to provide a reasonable basis for us 
to draw conclusions. We obtained audit evidence through
testing the effectiveness of controls, substantive procedures
or a combination of both.

Other
information
B_AuditorsGroup p47-49 tp_Layout 1  03/03/2014  13:41  Page 47 We considered the following areas to be those that required
particular focus in the current year. This is not a complete list
of all risks or areas of focus identified by our audit. We
discussed these areas of focus with the Audit Committee.
Their report on those matters that they considered to be
significant issues in relation to the financial statements is set
out on page 36.
Going Concern
Under the Listing Rules we are required to review the directors’
statement, set out on page 30, in relation to going concern.
We have nothing to report having performed our review.
As noted in the directors’ statement, the directors have
concluded that it is appropriate to prepare the Group’s
financial statements using the going concern basis of
accounting. The going concern basis presumes that the
Group has adequate resources to remain in operation, and
that the directors intend it to do so, for at least one year from
the date the financial statements were signed. As part of our
audit we have concluded that the directors’ use of the going
concern basis is appropriate.
However, because not all future events or conditions can be
predicted, these statements are not a guarantee as to the
Group’s ability to continue as a going concern.
Opinion on matter prescribed by the Companies Act 2006
In our opinion the information given in the Strategic Report
and the Directors’ Report for the financial year for which the
Group financial statements are prepared is consistent with
the Group financial statements.
Other matters on which we are required to 
report by exception 
Adequacy of information and explanations received
Under the Companies Act 2006 we are required to report to
you if, in our opinion we have not received all the information
and explanations we require for our audit. We have no
exceptions to report arising from this responsibility.
Directors’ remuneration
Under the Companies Act 2006 we are required to report if, 
in our opinion, certain disclosures of directors’ remuneration
specified by law have not been made, and under the Listing
Rules we are required to review certain elements of the report
to shareholders by the Board on directors’ remuneration. We
have no exceptions to report arising from these responsibilities.
Corporate Governance Statement
Under the Listing Rules we are required to review the 
part of the Corporate Governance Statement relating to 
the Company’s compliance with nine provisions of the UK
Corporate Governance Code (‘the Code’). We have 
nothing to report having performed our review.
On page 32 of the Annual Report, as required by the Code
Provision C.1.1, the directors state that they consider the
Annual Report taken as a whole to be fair, balanced and
understandable and provides the information necessary for
members to assess the Group’s performance, business
model and strategy. On page 36, as required by C.3.8 of the
Code, the Audit Committee has set out the significant issues
that it considered in relation to the financial statements, and
how they were addressed. Under ISAs (UK & Ireland) we are
required to report to you if, in our opinion:
• the statement given by the directors is materially
inconsistent with our knowledge of the Group acquired in
the course of performing our audit; or
• the section of the Annual Report describing the work of the
Audit Committee does not appropriately address matters
communicated by us to the Audit Committee.
We have no exceptions to report arising from this responsibility.
Other information in the Annual Report
Under ISAs (UK & Ireland), we are required to report to you if, 
in our opinion, information in the Annual Report is:
• materially inconsistent with the information in the audited
Group financial statements; or
• apparently materially incorrect based on, or materially
inconsistent with, our knowledge of the Group acquired in 
the course of performing our audit; or
• is otherwise misleading.
We have no exceptions to report arising from this responsibility.
Areas of focus How the scope of our audit
addressed the area of focus
Risk of fraud in revenue recognition
Auditing standards require that we 
consider this.
We focused on this area because of the
potential for misstatement of revenue due 
to the inherent complexities of revenue
recognition.
We performed year end sales cut off testing
and we interrogated the accounting system 
to match revenue transactions with cash
receipts to gain assurance over the 
occurrence of revenue transactions.
Long-term contracts
We focused on this area because of the
judgements required in accounting for the 
long term contracts. Our focus was on the
judgements around the level of provisions 
for re-work costs and other contractual 
provisions and the forecast costs to
complete the contracts. (Refer to note 16 to
the ﬁnancial statements.)
We tested the reasonableness of the level 
of provisions included in the forecast costs 
against provisions required in similar such
contracts and we challenged management 
on the level of provisions.
We tested the calculations of revenue
recognised on these contracts based on 
the work performed to date, which we 
agreed to supporting documentation, and 
the forecast costs to complete. We agreed 
the forecast costs to complete to project 
plans and challenged management on the
preparation of these plans.
Risk of management override 
of internal controls 
Auditing standards require that we 
consider this.
We tested manual journal entries. We
considered whether there was evidence 
of bias by the directors in the signiﬁcant
accounting estimates and judgements 
relevant to the ﬁnancial statements. We also
assessed the overall control environment of 
the Group, including the arrangements for 
staff to “whistle-blow” inappropriate actions
and discussed with senior management 
the possibilities for management override 
of controls.

54 Porvair plc Annual Report & Accounts 2013
1 Summary of signiﬁcant accounting policies 
Porvair plc is a public limited company registered and domiciled in the UK and listed on the London Stock Exchange. 
The principal accounting policies applied in the preparation of these consolidated financial statements are set out below.
These policies have been consistently applied to all the years presented, unless otherwise stated. 
Basis of preparation
The consolidated financial statements of the Group have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting
Standards (IFRSs) as endorsed by the European Union, the IFRS Interpretations Committee (formerly the International
Financial Reporting Interpretations Committee (IFRIC)) interpretations and those parts of the Companies Act 2006 applicable
to companies reporting under IFRS. The Company has elected to prepare its entity accounts in accordance with United
Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice (“UK GAAP”) and these are presented on pages 85 to 91.
The financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis and under the historical cost convention as modified
by the recognition of financial assets and financial liabilities (including derivative financial instruments) at fair value through
profit or loss. 
Basis of consolidation
The Group applies the acquisition method to account for business combinations. The consolidated financial statements
incorporate the financial statements of the Company and entities controlled by the Company (its subsidiaries) made up to
30 November each year. Control is achieved where the Company has the power to govern the financial and operating policies
of an investee entity so as to obtain benefits from its activities.
On acquisition, the assets and liabilities and contingent liabilities of a subsidiary are measured at their fair values at the date of
acquisition. Any excess of the cost of acquisition over the fair values of the identifiable net assets acquired is recognised as
goodwill. Acquisition related costs are expensed as incurred. 
The results of subsidiaries acquired or disposed of during the year are included in the consolidated income statement from
the effective date of acquisition or up to the effective date of disposal, as appropriate. Where necessary, adjustments are
made to the financial statements of subsidiaries to bring the accounting policies used into line with those used by the Group.
Any contingent consideration to be transferred by the Group is recognised at fair value at the acquisition date. Subsequent
changes to the fair value of the contingent consideration that is deemed to be an asset or liability is recognised in accordance
with IAS 39 either in profit or loss or as a change to other comprehensive income. Contingent consideration that is classified
as equity is not re-measured, and its subsequent settlement is accounted for within equity.
All intra-group transactions, balances, income and expenditures are eliminated on consolidation.
Use of assumptions and estimates
The preparation of the consolidated financial statements requires management to make judgements, estimates and
assumptions that affect the application of policies and reported amounts of assets and liabilities, income and expenses. 
The estimates and associated assumptions are based on historical experience and various other factors that are believed 
to be reasonable under the circumstances including management’s best knowledge of the amount, event or actions. 
The results form the basis of making judgements about carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily 
apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates.
The estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are
recognised in the period in which the estimate is revised.
Material estimates and assumptions are made in particular with regard to: establishing uniform depreciation and amortisation
periods for the Group, goodwill and intangible assets valuation (cash flows and discount rate), impairment testing,
assumptions used in the calculation of share based payments, parameters for measuring pension and other provisions and
the likelihood that tax assets can be realised.
The Group applies the percentage of completion method in accounting for its construction contracts. Use of the percentage
of completion method requires the Group to estimate the construction performed to date as a proportion of the total
construction to be performed. Estimating the costs to complete is considered to be a material estimate.
The Group tests annually whether goodwill has suffered any impairment. The recoverable amounts of cash-generating units
have been determined based on value-in-use calculations. These calculations require the use of estimates (note 10).
Goodwill
Goodwill arising on consolidation represents the excess of the cost of acquisition over the Group’s interest in the fair value of
the identifiable assets and liabilities of a subsidiary at the date of acquisition. The cost of acquisition includes the fair value of
deferred and contingent consideration.
Goodwill is recognised as an asset at cost less accumulated impairment losses and reviewed for impairment annually, and
more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate potential impairment. Any impairment is recognised
immediately in the income statement and is not subsequently reversed.
For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill acquired in a business combination is allocated to each of the cash
generating units that is expected to benefit from the synergies of the combination.
On disposal of a subsidiary, the attributable amount of goodwill is included in the determination of the profit or loss on
disposal.
Goodwill arising on acquisitions before the date of transition to IFRSs has been retained at the previous UK GAAP amounts
subject to being tested for impairment since that date.

1 Summary of signiﬁcant accounting policies continued
Revenue recognition (excluding construction contracts)
Revenue comprises the invoiced value of goods and services supplied net of value added tax and other sales taxes. Revenue
is recognised when goods are despatched to the customer at which point the risks and rewards of ownership are transferred.
Revenue from service contracts is recognised on a straight-line basis over the contract period.
Interest income is accrued on a straight-line basis, by reference to the principal outstanding and the effective interest rate
applicable, which is the rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash receipts through the expected life of the financial
asset to that asset’s net carrying amount.
Construction contracts
Where the outcome of a construction contract can be estimated reliably, revenue and costs are recognised by reference to
the stage of completion of the contract activity at the balance sheet date. This is normally measured by the proportion that
contract costs incurred for work performed to date bear to the estimated total contract costs, except where this would not 
be representative of the stage of completion. Variations in contract work, claims and incentive payments are included to the
extent that the amount can be measured reliably and its receipt is considered probable. Contract costs include costs directly
related to the specific contract and indirect costs attributable to the contract.
Where the outcome of a construction contract cannot be estimated reliably, contract revenue is recognised to the extent of
contract costs incurred where it is probable they will be recoverable. Contract costs are recognised as expenses in the period
in which they are incurred.
When it is probable that total contract costs will exceed total revenue, the expected loss is recognised as an expense
immediately.
Leasing
Leases are classified as finance leases whenever the terms of the lease transfer substantially all the risks and rewards of
ownership to the lessee. All other leases are classified as operating leases. Finance lease payments are allocated between the
liability and finance charges so as to achieve a constant rate on the finance balance outstanding. The rental obligations, net of
finance charges, are included in current and non-current liabilities. The interest element of the finance cost is charged to the
income statement over the lease period so as to produce a constant periodic rate of interest on the remaining balance of the
liability for each period.
Rentals payable under operating leases are charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the term of the
relevant lease.
Foreign currencies
The consolidated financial statements are presented in Pounds Sterling, which is the Company’s functional and presentation
currency. The Group determines the functional currency of each entity based on the primary economic environment in which
the entity operates and items included in the financial statements of each entity are measured using that functional currency.
Foreign currency transactions are translated into the functional currency using the exchange rates prevailing at the dates of
the transactions or valuation where items are re-measured. At each balance sheet date, monetary assets and liabilities that
are denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at the rates prevailing on the balance sheet date. Foreign exchange
gains and losses resulting from the settlement of such transactions and from the translation at year-end exchange rates of
monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are recognised in the income statement, except when
deferred in other comprehensive income as qualifying cash flow hedges.
On consolidation, the assets and liabilities of the Group’s overseas operations, borrowings and other currency instruments are
translated at exchange rates prevailing on the balance sheet date. Income and expense items are translated at the average
exchange rates for the period unless exchange rates fluctuate significantly. Exchange differences arising, if any, are classified
as other comprehensive income and transferred to the Group’s translation reserve. 
Goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on the acquisition of a foreign entity are treated as assets and liabilities of the
foreign entity and translated at the closing rate.
Borrowing costs
All borrowing costs are typically recognised in the income statement in the period in which they are incurred, with the
exception of borrowing costs incurred on the arrangement of new facilities which are capitalised and subsequently recognised
in the income statement over the period of the borrowings.
Government grants
Government grants for the development of new products are recognised over the periods necessary to match them with the
related costs and are deducted in reporting the related expense.
Retirement benefit costs
Payments to defined contribution retirement benefit schemes are charged as an expense as they fall due. 
For defined benefit retirement schemes, the cost of providing benefits is determined using the Projected Unit Credit Method,
with actuarial valuations being carried out at each balance sheet date. Actuarial gains and losses are recognised in full in the
period in which they occur. They are recognised in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income.

Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued
56 Porvair plc Annual Report & Accounts 2013
1 Summary of signiﬁcant accounting policies continued
The retirement benefit obligation in the balance sheet represents the present value of the defined benefit obligation as
adjusted for unrecognised past service cost and as reduced by the fair value of scheme assets. 
Taxation
The tax expense represents the sum of the current tax and deferred tax.
Current tax is based on taxable profit for the period. Taxable profit differs from net profit as reported in the income statement
because it excludes items of income or expense that are taxable or deductible in other periods and it further excludes items
that are never taxable or deductible. The Group’s liability for current tax is calculated using tax rates that have been enacted
or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is the tax expected to be payable or recoverable on differences between the carrying amounts of assets 
and liabilities in the financial statements and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable profit, and is
accounted for using the balance sheet liability method. Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised for all taxable
temporary differences and deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be
available against which deductible temporary differences can be utilised. Such assets and liabilities are not recognised if the
temporary difference arises from goodwill or from the initial recognition (other than a business combination) of other assets
and liabilities in a transaction that affects neither the tax profit nor the accounting profit.
Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for taxable temporary differences arising on investments in subsidiaries and associates,
except where the Group is able to control the reversal of the temporary difference and it is probable that the temporary
difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each balance sheet date and reduced to the extent that it is no
longer probable that sufficient taxable profits will be available to allow all, or part, of the asset to be recovered.
Deferred tax is calculated at the tax rates which have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date 
and are expected to apply in the period when the liability is settled or the asset is realised. Deferred tax is recognised in the
income statement, except when it relates to items recognised directly to other comprehensive income or directly to equity. 
In this case, the deferred tax is also recognised in other comprehensive income or directly in equity, respectively.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to set off current tax assets against
current tax liabilities and when they relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority and the Group intends to
settle its current tax assets and liabilities on a net basis.
Property, plant and equipment
Property, plant and equipment for use in the production or supply of goods or services, or for administrative purposes, are
stated in the balance sheet at their cost less any subsequent accumulated depreciation and subsequent accumulated
impairment losses. 
Property, plant and equipment in the course of construction for production or administrative purposes are carried at cost, less
any recognised impairment loss. Cost includes professional fees and, for qualifying assets, borrowing costs capitalised in
accordance with the Group’s accounting policy. Depreciation for these assets, on the same basis as other assets,
commences when the assets are ready for their intended use.
Depreciation is charged so as to write off the cost of assets, other than assets under construction, over their estimated useful
lives, using the straight line method, on the following bases:
Buildings                                                2.5 – 3%
Plant, machinery and equipment            10 – 33%
Freehold land is not depreciated.
Assets held under finance leases are depreciated over their expected useful lives on the same basis as owned assets or,
where shorter, over the term of the relevant lease.
The gain or loss arising on the disposal or retirement of an asset is determined as the difference between the sales proceeds
and the carrying amount of the assets and is recognised in the income statement.
The assets’ residual values and useful lives are reviewed, and adjusted if appropriate, at the end of each reporting period.

Internally generated intangible assets – research and development expenditure
Expenditure on research activities is recognised as an expense in the period in which it is incurred.
An internally generated intangible asset arising from the Group’s product development expenditure is recognised only if all of
the following criteria are demonstrable:
• The technical feasibility of completing the intangible asset so that it will be available for use or sale;
• The intention to complete the intangible asset and use or sell it;
• The ability to use the intangible asset or to sell it; 
• The way in which the intangible asset will generate probable future economic benefits;
• The availability of adequate technical, financial and other resources to complete the development and to use or sell the
intangible asset; and  
• The ability to measure reliably the expenditure attributable to the intangible asset during its development. 
Internally generated intangible assets are valued at cost and held at cost less accumulated amortisation and impairment
losses, which is recognised as an expense on a straight line basis over their estimated useful lives. Useful life is determined
with reference to estimated product life in the industry in which the expenditure has been incurred. Useful life of the Group’s
development expenditure is currently between 3 and 10 years. Amortisation of development expenditure commences when
development has been completed to management satisfaction and the related project is ready for its intended use. Where no
internally generated intangible asset can be recognised, development expenditure is recognised as an expense in the period
in which it is incurred.
Patents, trademarks and know-how
Patents, trademarks and know-how purchased as part of an acquisition, where there are expected future economic benefits,
are initially measured at fair value and amortised over their estimated useful lives of 3-5 years.
Software
Software costs are classified as intangible fixed assets and measured initially at purchase cost. Amortisation is charged on a
straight line basis over their estimated useful lives of 3-5 years.
Impairment of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets 
The Group reviews annually the carrying amounts of its property, plant and equipment and intangible assets to determine
whether there is any indication that those assets have suffered an impairment loss. If any such indication exists, the
recoverable amount of the asset is estimated in order to determine the extent of the impairment loss (if any). For the purposes
of assessing impairment, assets are grouped at the lowest levels for which there are separately identifiable cash flows (cash
generating units).
Recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs to sell and value in use. In assessing value in use, the estimated
future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments
of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset for which the estimates of future cash flows have not been
adjusted. If the recoverable amount of an asset or cash generating unit is estimated to be less than its carrying amount, the
carrying amount of the asset or cash generating unit is reduced to its recoverable amount. An impairment loss is recognised
as an expense immediately.
When an impairment loss subsequently reverses, the carrying amount of the asset or cash generating unit (other than
goodwill) is increased to the revised estimate of its recoverable amount, but so that the increased carrying amount does not
exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined had no impairment loss been recognised for the asset or cash
generating unit in prior years. A reversal of an impairment loss is recognised in the income statement immediately.
Inventories
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Cost comprises direct materials and, where applicable,
direct labour costs and those overheads that have been incurred in bringing the inventories to their present location and
condition. Cost is calculated using the weighted average method. Net realisable value represents the estimated selling price
less all estimated costs of completion and costs to be incurred in marketing, selling and distribution. Where necessary,
provision is made for obsolete, slow moving and defective inventories.
Loans and receivables
Loans and receivables are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an active
market. They are included in current assets, except for those with maturities greater than 12 months after the balance sheet
date. These are classified as non-current assets. Loans are classified as “other receivables” in the balance sheet.
Trade receivables
Trade receivables are recognised initially at fair value and subsequently held at amortised cost. A provision for impairment 
of trade receivables is established when there is objective evidence that the Group will not be able to collect all amounts 
due according to the original terms of receivables. Significant financial difficulties of the debtor and default or delinquency 
in payments when credit control procedures have been applied are indicators an impairment may be required. The amount 
of the provision is the difference between the asset’s carrying amount and the present value of the estimated future cash
flows, discounted at the effective interest rate. The amount of the provision is recognised in the income statement within
administrative expenses. When a trade receivable is uncollectible, it is written off to the provision for impairment. Subsequent
recoveries of amounts previously written off are credited against administrative expenses in the income statement.

1 Summary of signiﬁcant accounting policies continued
Cash and cash equivalents
In the consolidated statement of cash flows, cash and cash equivalents includes cash in hand, deposits held at call with
banks, other short-term highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less and bank overdrafts. In the
consolidated balance sheet, bank overdrafts are shown within borrowings in current liabilities.
Bank borrowings
Interest bearing bank loans and overdrafts are recorded at the proceeds received, net of direct issue costs. Finance charges,
including premiums payable on settlement or redemption and direct issue costs, are accounted for on an accruals basis in the
income statement using the effective interest method and are added to the carrying amount of the instrument, to the extent
that they are not settled in the period in which they arise.
Trade payables
Trade payables are not interest bearing and are initially recognised at fair value and subsequently held at amortised cost.
Equity instruments
Ordinary shares are classified as equity. Equity instruments issued by the Company are recorded at the proceeds received,
net of direct issue costs.
Derivative financial instruments and hedge accounting
The Group’s activities expose it primarily to the financial risks of changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates. 
The Group uses foreign exchange forward contracts and interest rate swap agreements to hedge these exposures. The
Group does not use derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes.
The use of financial derivatives is governed by the Group’s policies approved by the Board of Directors, which provides written
principles on the use of financial derivatives.
Derivatives are initially recognised at fair value on the date a derivative contract is entered into and are subsequently
remeasured at their fair value. The method of recognising the resulting gain or loss depends on whether the derivative is
designated as a hedging instrument, and if so, the nature of the item being hedged. The Group designates certain derivatives
as cash flow hedges.
For cash flow hedges the Group documents at the inception of the transaction the relationship between hedging instruments
and hedged items, as well as its risk management objectives and strategy for undertaking various hedging transactions. The
Group also documents its assessment, both at hedge inception and on an ongoing basis, of whether the derivatives that are
used in hedging transactions are highly effective in offsetting changes in fair values or cash flows of hedged items. 
The effective portion of changes in the fair value of derivatives that are designated and qualify as cash flow hedges is
recognised in equity. The gain or loss relating to the ineffective portion is recognised immediately in the income statement.
Amounts accumulated in equity are recycled in the income statement in the periods when the hedged item affects profit or
loss (for example, when the forecast sale that is hedged takes place). The gain or loss relating to the effective portion of
interest rate swaps hedging variable rate borrowings is recognised in the income statement.
When a hedging instrument expires or is sold, or when a hedge no longer meets the criteria for hedge accounting, any
cumulative gain or loss existing in equity at that time remains in equity and is recognised when the forecast transaction is
ultimately recognised in the income statement. When a forecast transaction is no longer expected to occur, the cumulative
gain or loss that was reported in equity is immediately transferred to the income statement.
Changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments that do not qualify for hedge accounting are recognised in the
income statement as they arise.
Derivatives embedded in other financial instruments or other host contracts are treated as separate derivatives when their
risks and characteristics are not closely related to those of host contracts and the host contracts are not carried at fair value,
with unrealised gains or losses reported in the income statement.
Provisions
Provisions have been made for future dilapidation costs on leased property. These provisions are the Directors’ best estimates
as the actual costs and timing of future cash flows are dependent on future events. Any difference between expectations and
the actual future liability will be accounted for in the period when such determination is made.
Where the impact of discounting is material, the Group discounts at its weighted average cost of capital, unless some other
rate is more appropriate in the circumstances.
Share based payments
The Group has applied the requirements of IFRS 2, “Share based payment”. In accordance with the transitional provisions,
IFRS 2 has been applied to all grants of equity instruments after 7 November 2002 that were unvested as of 1 January 2005.
The Group issues equity settled, share based payments to certain employees. Equity settled, share based payments are
measured at fair value at the date of grant. The fair value determined at the grant date of the equity settled, share based
payments is expensed on a straight line basis over the vesting period, based on the Group’s estimate of shares that will
eventually vest. The charge is then credited back to reserves.
Non-market performance and service conditions are included in assumptions about the number of options that are expected
to vest.

1 Summary of signiﬁcant accounting policies continued
At each balance sheet date, the Group revises its estimates of the number of options that are expected to vest. It recognises
the impact of the revision to original estimates, if any, in the income statement, with a corresponding adjustment to equity.
Fair value is measured by use of a Black-Scholes model. The expected life used in the model has been adjusted, based on
management’s best estimate, for the effects of non-transferability, exercise restrictions, and behavioural considerations.
Exceptional items
The Group presents certain items as “exceptional”. These are material items which derive from events or transactions that fall
within the Group’s ordinary activities and which by virtue of their size, nature or incidence need to be separately disclosed to
enable an understanding of the Group’s underlying financial performance. Examples of items include, but are not limited to,
acquisition costs, disposals or restructuring of a significant part of an operating segment, impairment events and litigation
claims by or against the Group.
Segment reporting
An operating segment is a component of an entity that engages in business activities from which it may earn revenues and
incur expenses (including revenues and expenses relating to transactions with other components of the same entity). An
operating segment’s operating results are regularly reviewed by the entity’s chief operating decision maker to make decisions
about resources to be allocated to the segment and assess its performance, and for which discrete financial information is
available. Operating segments are aggregated into reporting segments where they share similar economic characteristics 
as a result of the nature of the products sold or the services provided, the production processes used to manufacture the
products, the type of customer for the products and services, and the methods used to distribute the products or provide 
the services.
Dividend distribution
Dividend distribution to the Company’s shareholders is recognised as a liability in the Group’s financial statements in the
period in which the dividends are approved by the Company’s shareholders.
New standards, amendments and interpretations
(a) Standards, amendments and interpretations effective for the first time in the year ended 30 November 2013:
• Amendment to IAS 12, ‘Income taxes’, on deferred tax; and
• Amendment to IAS 1, ‘Financial statement presentation’, regarding other comprehensive income.
None of these have had any impact on the reported results of the Group.
(b) Standards, amendments and interpretations that are not yet effective and have not been early adopted:
• Amendment to IAS 19, ‘Employee benefits’;
• Amendment to IFRS 1, ‘First time adoption’, on government loans;
• Amendment to IFRS 7, ‘Financial instruments: Disclosures’, on asset and liability offsetting;
• Amendment to IFRSs 10, 11 and 12 on transition guidance;
• Annual improvements 2011;
• IFRS 10, ‘Consolidated financial statements’;
• IFRS 11, ‘Joint arrangements’;
• IFRS 12, ‘Disclosures of interests in other entities’;
• IFRS 13, ‘Fair value measurement’;
• IAS 27 (revised 2011), ‘Separate financial statements’;
• IAS 28 (revised 2011), ‘Associates and joint ventures’;
• IFRIC 20, ‘Stripping costs in the production phase of a surface mine’;
• Amendment to IAS 32, ‘Financial instruments: Presentation’, on asset and liability offsetting;
• Amendments to IFRSs 10 and 12 and IAS 27 on consolidation for investment entities;
• Amendment to IAS 36, ‘Impairment of assets’ on recoverable amount disclosures;
• Amendment to IAS 39, ‘Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement’, on novation of derivatives;
• IFRIC 21, ‘Levies’; and
• IFRS 9, ‘Financial instruments’.
The Directors do not anticipate that the adoption of these standards, amendments and interpretations, where relevant, in future
periods will have a material impact on the Group’s financial statements, other than the adoption of IAS 19, ‘Employee benefits’.
IAS 19, ‘Employee benefits’ was amended in June 2011 and is effective for periods beginning on or after 1 January 2013. The
impact will be as follows: to immediately recognise all past service costs; and to replace interest cost and expected return on
plan assets with a net interest amount that is calculated by applying the discount rate to the net defined benefit liability. The

2013 2012
£’000 £’000
Deferred tax on share based payments (direct to equity) (75) (228)
Deferred tax on actuarial losses on the pension fund (direct to comprehensive income) (471) (565)
(546) (793)
The standard rate of Corporation Tax in the UK changed from 24% to 23% with effect from 1 April 2013. Accordingly, the
theoretical effective tax rate applied to the Group’s profits for this accounting period is 23.33%. The standard rate of
Corporation Tax in the UK will fall in future periods and as a result the Group’s theoretical future effective tax rate will be
between 20% and 23%.
During the year, as a result of the change in UK Corporation Tax rates which were effective from 1 April 2013, deferred tax
balances have been remeasured. Deferred tax relating to temporary differences which are expected to reverse prior to 1 April
2014 is measured at 23%, deferred tax relating to temporary differences expected to reverse after 1 April 2014 is measured at
the tax rate of 21% and deferred tax relating to temporary differences expected to reverse after 1 April 2015 is measured at
the tax rate of 20% as these are the enacted rates that will apply on reversal.

based on financial budgets approved by management covering a three-year period. Pre-tax cash flows beyond the three-year
period are extrapolated using the estimated growth rates stated below.
Key assumptions used for value-in-use calculations:                                                                                                            Metals Filtration                           Microfiltration

Growth rate used to extrapolate cash ﬂows beyond the budget period 3% 3% 3% 3%
Weighted average cost of capital (pre-tax) 10.6% 10.6% 9.5% 9.6%
These assumptions have been used for the analysis of each operation within the operating segment. Management determined
budgeted gross margin based on past performance and its expectations for the development in the Group’s markets. The
average growth rates used are consistent with past experience and market expectations. The discount rates used are pre-tax
and reflect specific risks relating to the relevant segments.
Based on the results of the current period impairment review, no impairment charges have been recognised by the Group in
the year ended 30 November 2013. Having assessed the anticipated future cash flows, the Directors do not currently foresee
any reasonable changes in assumptions that would lead to such an impairment charge in the year ended 30 November 2013.

The gain recognised in the profit and loss account in the year for non-hedged derivatives amounted to £172,000 (2012: £54,000).
Under IFRS the fair value of all forward foreign exchange contracts and currency options are recognised on the balance sheet
with the corresponding entry included within other comprehensive income where designated as a cash flow hedge and
administrative expenses where hedge accounting has not been applied. The Group recognises all forward foreign exchange
contracts and currency options on the balance sheet at fair value using external market data. 
Derivatives relating to trading activities are classified as a current asset or liability. The full fair value of a hedging derivative is
classified as a non-current asset or liability if the remaining maturity of the hedged item is more than 12 months and, as a
current asset or liability, if the maturity of the hedged item is less than 12 months.
The notional principal amount of the outstanding US dollar forward foreign exchange contracts at 30 November 2013 is
£15.1 million (2012: £6.8 million) which mature in December 2013, January 2014, February 2014, March 2014, April 2014,
May 2014, June 2014, July 2014, September 2014 and January 2015.
The Group has contracted interest rate swap agreements for US$7.5 million (2012: US$7.5 million) of its US$ borrowings until
December 2013. The Group has accounted for these swap agreements using hedge accounting with gains or losses being
recognised in other comprehensive income.

Credit risk in relation to trade receivables
The Group has a diverse customer base both geographically and in the number of industries in which it operates. 
There is credit risk associated with a decline in a particular industry or geographic region. To offset this risk, the Group has
implemented policies that require appropriate credit checks to be performed on significant potential customers before 
sales are made. Customer orders are checked against pre-set criteria before acceptance and credit control procedures are
applied. Letters of credit and payments in advance are obtained from customers as appropriate.
The Group does not hold security over its receivables, so was exposed to credit risk in respect of the net trade receivables
balance of £11,568,000 (2012: £10,884,000). Management believe the credit quality of trade receivables which are within the
Group’s typical payment terms of between 30 and 90 days (and which are less than 3 months overdue) are good, with
£2,473,000 (2012: £1,388,000) being past due but not impaired at the year end, of which £2,029,000 (2012: £1,070,000) are
less than 30 days overdue.

trade receivables during the year ended 30 November 2013 on the grounds of recoverability. The Group has utilised
provisions for impaired receivables of £136,000 (2012: £87,000) during the year ended 30 November 2013.

On 25 January 2013, the Group entered into new five year banking facilities sufficient for its foreseeable needs comprising 
a US$20 million revolving credit facility, a £2.5 million amortising term loan (reduced to £1.75 million at 30 November 2013)
and a £2.5 million multi-currency overdraft facility.
The loans are shown net of issue costs of £134,000 (2012: £nil) which are being amortised over the life of the loan
arrangements. The term and multi-currency revolving credit facilities expire in January 2018.
At 30 November 2013, the Group had £7.6 million (2012: £1.0 million) unused loan facility and an unutilised £2.5 million
(2012: £2.5 million) overdraft facility.
The carrying values of bank borrowings approximate their fair value as the impact of discounting is not significant. The fair
values are based on the cashflows discounted using a rate based on the borrowing rate of 3.8% (2012: 3.0%).
The multi-currency facility and amortising debt facility are secured by fixed and floating charges against the Group’s assets.

Additional pension commitments 134 143

The additional pension commitments arise out of contractual commitments to certain employees outside the scope of the
defined benefit plan. These liabilities will crystallise between one and ten years. 
a) Defined contribution schemes
For its US employees, the Group operates a defined contribution pension plan (“the Pension Plan”) covering all eligible
full-time employees. The Group contributes 3% of each participant’s base salary each year to the Pension Plan. In 2013, this
amounted to £176,000 (2012: £153,000). In 2013, the Group also made payments of £172,000 (2012: £155,000) to
designated US 401k schemes on behalf of its employees.
In the UK, after the closure of the defined benefit plan to new members, the Group introduced a stakeholder plan to be
offered to all new employees. Total employer contributions in the UK paid to defined contribution schemes were £441,000
(2012: £266,000).
b) Defined benefit plan
The Group operates a defined benefit pension scheme, The Porvair plc Pension and Death Benefit Plan (the ‘Plan’), covering
a number of employees in the UK. The pension scheme is financed through a separate trust fund administered by Trustees
with an independent Chairman. The Plan was closed to new entrants in October 2001.
Formal valuations of the Plan by a professionally qualified actuary are carried out at least every three years using the projected
unit method. Under this method the current service cost will increase in relation to the salaries of the members in future years
as those members approach retirement. The latest available full actuarial valuation was at 31 March 2012.

assumptions assumptions assumptions
The principal actuarial assumptions adopted in the 2012 valuation were: %%%
Past service investment return:
Pre-retirement 5.75 6.75 6.75
Post-retirement 3.75 5.00 4.75
Salary increases 3.50 3.25 4.00
The actuarial value of the assets on the funding basis was sufficient to cover 66% of the benefits that had accrued to
members after allowing for expected increases in pensionable remuneration, and the current funding deficiency amounted to
£11.0 million. A full triennial actuarial valuation of the assets and liabilities of the defined benefit scheme was completed in
2013, based on data at 31 March 2012. As a result of this review, the Group and the Trustees agreed to alter the employer’s
contributions from 8.2% of salary to 13.3% of salary. A £194,000 annual contribution towards the running costs of the
scheme will start in March 2014, increasing by 3.25% per annum. The Group also committed to make additional annual
contributions to cover the past service deficit of £456,000 per annum increasing by 5% per annum commencing in December
2013. The funding shortfall is expected to be eliminated by December 2027. The next full actuarial valuation of the scheme
will be based on the pension scheme’s position at 31 March 2015 and is expected to be completed before June 2016.

The UK pension charge for the year was £240,000 (2012: £200,000); the funding via employer contributions was £780,000
(2012: £469,000). 
The valuation of the deficit in the balance sheet is based on the most recent actuarial valuation of the Plan as updated by a
qualified actuary to take account of the market value of the assets and the present value of the liabilities of the Plan at
30 November 2013.

The SAPS base mortality tables have been used, with a 110% multiplier allowing for future improvements of 1.25% per annum
(2012: 1.0% per annum). The average life expectancy in years of a pensioner retiring at age 65 on the balance sheet date is
21.5 (2012: 19.7) for men and 23.7 (2012: 22.3) for women. The average life expectancy in years of a member currently aged
50 on retirement on the balance sheet date is 22.8 (2012: 21.1) for men and 25.2 (2012: 23.7) for women.

22  Share options and share based payment
Share options are granted to Executive Directors and to selected employees. Details of share options awarded, including
exercise price and performance conditions, are disclosed in the Remuneration Report on pages 37 to 46.
These equity settled, share based payments are measured at fair value at the date of grant. The fair value determined at the
grant date of the equity settled, share based payments is expensed to the income statement on a straight line basis over the
vesting period, based on the Group’s estimate of shares that will eventually vest. The charge is then credited back to reserves.
Fair value is measured by use of a Black-Scholes model. The expected life used in the model has been adjusted, based on
management’s best estimate, for the effects of non-transferability, exercise restrictions, and behavioural considerations.

26  Financial risk management
The Group’s activities expose it to a variety of financial risks: market risk (including foreign exchange risk and interest rate cash
flow risk), credit risk and liquidity risk. The Group’s overall risk management programme is disclosed on page 21 to 24 of the
Strategic Report and page 30 of the Directors’ report. The Group uses derivative financial instruments to hedge certain risk
exposures.
Foreign exchange risk
The Group operates internationally and is exposed to foreign exchange risk arising from various currency exposures, primarily
in respect of the US dollar and the Euro. Foreign exchange risk arises from future commercial transactions, recognised assets
and liabilities and net investments in foreign operations.
(i) US dollar
The Group has investments in its US based subsidiaries denominated in US dollars. Currency exposure arising from the net
assets of the Group’s US operations is managed through borrowings denominated in US dollars.
The UK operations generate significant US dollar revenues and forward contracts are used to reduce the impact of
movements in the US dollar exchange rate.
The Group has the following outstanding US dollar forward contracts:
2013 2012
$’000 $’000 
Outstanding forward contracts 24,710 10,960 
The Group has the following current assets and liabilities denominated in US dollars:
2013 2012
$’000 $’000 
Trade receivables denominated in US dollars 10,667 9,278 
Other receivables denominated in US dollars 12,132 8,185 
Cash balances denominated in US dollars 6,446 7,852 
Trade payables denominated in US dollars (4,539) (4,103)
Other payables denominated in US dollars (14,360) (7,823)
10,346 13,389 
For illustrative purposes, if the US dollar exchange rate were to move by 10% against Sterling, the Group would make the
following gains/(losses):
2013 2012
£’000 £’000 
US dollar strengthens 701 928 
US dollar weakens (574) (758)
(ii) Euro
The Group has investments in its European based subsidiaries denominated in Euros. Currency exposure arising from the net
assets of the Group’s European operations is managed through net purchases from suppliers as a partial natural hedge.
The Group has the following current assets and liabilities denominated in Euros:
2013 2012
€’000 €’000 
Trade receivables denominated in Euros 1,770 1,937 
Other receivables denominated in Euros 764 1,113 
Cash balances denominated in Euros 2,209 2,205 
Trade payables denominated in Euros (1,837) (1,340)
Other payables denominated in Euros (721) (535)

following gains/(losses):
2013 2012
£’000 £’000 
Euro strengthens 202 306 
Euro weakens (165) (250)
Cash flow interest rate risk
The Group’s interest rate risk arises from borrowings. Borrowings in the years ended 30 November 2013 and 2012 carry
interest at variable rates and are denominated in US dollars and Sterling. The Group has entered into interest rate swap
agreements on 100% (2012: 73%) of the US denominated borrowings to reduce the impact of future changes in US interest
rates. On 12 December 2013, interest rate swap agreements expired reducing the fixed proportion of US denominated
borrowings to nil%.
The Group is exposed to cash flow risk in respect of loans not covered by the interest rate swap agreements.
For illustrative purposes, if interest rates had been 0.5% higher/lower on borrowings throughout the year with all other
variables held constant, the post tax profit for the year would have been £28,000 (2012: £31,000) lower/higher respectively.
Credit risk
Credit risk is disclosed in notes 13 and 14.
Liquidity risk
Banking facilities, including a maturity profile, are disclosed in note 17. The amortising debt commits the Group to quarterly
repayments of principal of £250,000 (2012: £250,000). Interest is payable based on the length of the revolving facilities,
typically between 1 and 3 months and on a quarterly basis for the term loan. The Group is required to meet banking covenants
on a quarterly basis. Whilst the Group has sufficient cash reserves and expects future trading to enable it to meet its cash flow
obligations, should trading performance prevent it from doing so then the lender has recourse over the Group’s assets.
The table below analyses the Group’s non-derivative financial liabilities and net-settled derivative financial liabilities into relevant
maturity groupings based on the remaining period at the balance sheet date to the contractual maturity date. Derivative
financial liabilities are included in the analysis to the extent their contractual maturities are essential for an understanding of the
timing of cash flows. The amounts disclosed are the contractual undiscounted cash flows.

The table below analyses financial instruments carried at fair value, by valuation method. The different levels have been
defined below:
• Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (level 1).
• Inputs other than quoted prices included within level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly (that is, as
prices) or indirectly (that is, derived from prices) (level 2).
• Inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data (that is, unobservable inputs) (level 3).
Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total
30 November 2013 £’000 £’000 £’000 £’000
Financial assets at fair value through proﬁt or loss:
– Trading derivatives – 239 – 239 
Foreign exchange contracts used for hedging – 932 – 932 
Derivatives used for hedging – (20) – (20)
– 1,151 – 1,151
Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total
30 November 2012 £’000 £’000 £’000 £’000
Financial liabilities at fair value through proﬁt or loss: 
– Trading derivatives – 67 – 67 
Derivatives used for hedging – (99) – (99)
– (32) – (32)
The fair value of financial instruments that are not traded in an active market (for example, over-the-counter derivatives) is
determined by using valuation techniques. These valuation techniques maximise the use of observable market data where it is
available and rely as little as possible on entity specific estimates. If all significant inputs required to fair value an instrument are
observable, the instrument is included in level 2.
Capital risk management
The Group’s objectives when managing capital are to safeguard the Group’s ability to operate as a going concern in order to
provide returns to shareholders, benefits for other stakeholders and to maintain an optimal capital structure to reduce the cost
of capital. In order to adjust the capital structure, the Group may adjust the amount of dividends paid to shareholders, return
capital to shareholders, issue new shares, or sell assets to reduce debt.
The Group monitors capital on the basis of the gearing ratio. This ratio is calculated as net debt divided by total capital. 
Net debt is calculated as total borrowings as shown in the consolidated balance sheet less cash and cash equivalents. 
Total capital is calculated as ‘equity’ as shown in the consolidated balance sheet. The gearing ratio at 30 November 2013 was
not applicable because the Group had a net cash position (2012: 9%).
The Group’s borrowings are subject to certain covenant restrictions imposed by the bank. These covenants have been fully
complied with during the year ended 30 November 2013.
27  Contingent liabilities
The Group has entered into advanced payment bonds totalling $10,282,000 relating to monies received in advance on
contracts. The bonds require the amount to be repaid in the event delivery is not made within certain parameters. The
advanced payment bonds are released up to 6 months after the delivery of goods and in any event no later than February
2016. The Group has entered into a performance bond totalling $981,000. The bond is released after a warranty period and
in any event no later than August 2016.

Report on the Parent Company financial statements
Our opinion
In our opinion the Parent Company financial statements:
• give a true and fair view of the state of the Parent Company’s
affairs as at 30 November 2013 and of its cash flows for the
year then ended;
• have been properly prepared in accordance with United
Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice; and
• have been prepared in accordance with the requirements 
of the Companies Act 2006.
This opinion is to be read in the context of what we say below.
What we have audited
The Parent Company financial statements, which are
prepared by Porvair plc, comprise:
• the Parent Company balance sheet as at 30 November 2013;
• the Parent Company reconciliation of movements in
shareholders’ funds; and
• the notes to the Parent Company financial statements, which
include a summary of significant accounting policies and
other explanatory information.
The financial reporting framework that has been applied in their
preparation comprises applicable law and United Kingdom
Accounting Standards (United Kingdom Generally Accepted
Accounting Practice).
In applying the financial reporting framework, the directors
have made a number of subjective judgements, for example
in respect of significant accounting estimates. In making such
estimates, they have made assumptions and considered
future events.
Certain disclosures required by the financial reporting
framework have been presented elsewhere in the Annual
Report, rather than in the notes to the financial statements.
These are cross-referenced from the financial statements and
are identified as audited.
What an audit of financial statements involves
We conducted our audit in accordance with International
Standards on Auditing (UK & Ireland) (“ISAs (UK & Ireland)”).
An audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts and
disclosures in the ﬁnancial statements sufﬁcient to give
reasonable assurance that the ﬁnancial statements are free
from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or error.
This includes an assessment of:
• whether the accounting policies are appropriate to the Parent
Company’s circumstances and have been consistently
applied and adequately disclosed;
• the reasonableness of significant accounting estimates made
by the directors; and 
• the overall presentation of the financial statements.
In addition, we read all the financial and non-financial
information in the Annual Report to identify material
inconsistencies with the audited Parent Company financial
statements and to identify any information that is apparently
materially incorrect based on, or materially inconsistent with,
the knowledge acquired by us in the course of performing 
the audit. If we become aware of any apparent material
misstatements or inconsistencies we consider the 
implications for our report.
Opinions on matters prescribed by the Companies Act 2006
In our opinion:
• the information given in the Strategic Report and the
Directors’ Report for the financial year for which the Parent
Company financial statements are prepared is consistent 
with the Parent Company financial statements; and
• the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be
audited has been properly prepared in accordance with
the Companies Act 2006.
Other matters on which we are required to report 
by exception
Adequacy of accounting records and information and
explanations received
Under the Companies Act 2006 we are required to report to
you if, in our opinion:
• we have not received all the information and explanations 
we require for our audit; or
• adequate accounting records have not been kept by the
Parent Company, or returns adequate for our audit have not
been received from branches not visited by us; or
• the Parent Company financial statements and the part of the
Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited are not in
agreement with the accounting records and returns.
We have no exceptions to report arising from this responsibility.
Directors’ remuneration
Under the Companies Act 2006 we are required to report if, 
in our opinion, certain disclosures of directors’ remuneration
specified by law have not been made. We have no exceptions
to report arising from this responsibility.
Other information in the Annual Report
Under ISAs (UK & Ireland), we are required to report to you if,
in our opinion, information in the Annual Report is:
• materially inconsistent with the information in the audited
Parent Company financial statements; or
• apparently materially incorrect based on, or materially
inconsistent with, our knowledge of the Parent Company
acquired in the course of performing our audit; or
• is otherwise misleading.
We have no exceptions to report arising from this responsibility.

1 Summary of signiﬁcant accounting policies
These financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis, under the historical cost convention and in
accordance with the Companies Act 2006 and applicable UK accounting standards. A summary of the more important
accounting policies is set out below, which have been applied on a consistent basis with the previous year, except where noted.
Tangible fixed assets 
Tangible fixed assets are capitalised at cost and are depreciated by equal annual amounts over their estimated useful lives.
Annual depreciation rates are 10% to 33.33% straight line for plant, machinery and equipment. 
Fixed asset investments
Investments held as fixed assets are stated at cost less provision for impairment in value. 
Impairment of assets
Assets are regularly reviewed to confirm their carrying values. Where the expected realisable value is lower than the book value,
the excess of book value is charged to the profit and loss account during the period. 
Patents and trademarks
All expenditure on the registration, renewal and maintenance of patents and trademarks is expensed as incurred.
Foreign exchange
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated into Sterling at the rates of exchange ruling at the
end of the financial year. 
Exchange differences arising on retranslation of non-monetary assets and liabilities are recognised directly to the exchange
reserve. All other foreign exchange differences are taken to the profit and loss account in the year in which they arise.
Deferred taxation
The charge for tax is based on the profit for the year and takes into account tax deferred or accelerated because of timing
differences between the treatment of certain items for accounting and tax purposes. Full provision is made for deferred tax
resulting from timing differences between profits computed for tax purposes and profits stated in the financial statements to the
extent that there is an obligation to pay more tax in the future as a result of the reversal of those timing differences. Deferred tax
assets are recognised to the extent that they are expected to be recoverable, and are measured on a non-discounted basis
based on tax rates and laws enacted, or substantively enacted, at the balance sheet date.
Pensions
Pension costs for defined benefit and defined contribution schemes are charged to the profit and loss account as incurred.
The Company participates in the Group’s defined benefit pension scheme (which is closed to new members), The Porvair plc
Pension and Death Benefit Plan. The Company includes only the cost of its contributions to the scheme in its profit and loss
account for the year because the structure of the scheme is such that it does not enable any individual group company to
identify its share of the assets and liabilities of the scheme.
Share based payments
The Company has applied the requirements of FRS 20, “Share based payments”. In accordance with the transitional provisions,
FRS 20 has been applied to all grants of equity instruments after 7 November 2002 that were unvested as of 1 January 2005.
Where the parent company has granted rights over its equity instruments to the employees of subsidiary companies, there is a
corresponding increase recognised in the investment in subsidiary undertakings in those years.
The Company issues equity settled, share based payments to certain employees. Equity settled, share based payments are
measured at fair value at the date of grant. The fair value determined at the grant date of the equity settled, share based
payments is expensed on a straight line basis over the vesting period, based on the Company’s estimate of shares that will
eventually vest. The charge is then credited back to reserves.
At each balance sheet date, the Company revises its estimates of the number of share options that are expected to vest. It
recognises the impact of the revisions to original estimates, if any, in the profit and loss account or, if relating to a subsidiary
undertaking in investment in subsidiary undertakings, with a corresponding adjustment to equity.
Fair value is measured by use of a Black-Scholes model. The expected life used in the model has been adjusted, based on
management’s best estimate, for the effects of non-transferability, exercise restrictions and behavioural considerations.
Operating leases
Rentals payable under operating leases are charged to the profit and loss account on a straight line basis over the term of the
relevant lease.
Borrowing costs
All borrowing costs are typically recognised in the profit and loss account in the period in which they are incurred. Borrowing
costs incurred in the arrangement of new facilities are capitalised and subsequently recognised in the profit and loss account
over the period of the borrowings.
Related party transactions
The Company has taken advantage of the exemption available to parent companies under FRS 8, ‘Related Party Disclosures’,
not to disclose transactions and balances with wholly owned subsidiaries.

There were no unrecognised deferred tax amounts at 30 November 2013 (2012: £nil).
During the year, as a result of the change in UK Corporation Tax rates which were effective from 1 April 2013, deferred tax
balances have been remeasured. Deferred tax relating to temporary differences which are expected to reverse prior to 1 April
2014 is measured at 23%, deferred tax relating to temporary differences expected to reverse after 1 April 2014 is measured at
the tax rate of 21% and deferred tax relating to temporary differences expected to reverse after 1 April 2015 is measured at the
tax rate of 20% as these are the enacted rates that will apply on reversal.
The deferred tax asset in the table above has been included in debtors: amounts falling due after more than one year (note 6).

Operational review
Chairman’s statement
Sir Ian Wood, 
Chairman
2008 was a very successful year for 
Wood Group with record revenue of 
$5.2bn and record EBITA
 1
 of $441m. 
This excellent performance means 
that over the last four years we have 
delivered compound annual growth 
in adjusted diluted earnings per 
share
 4
 in excess of 40%.

Reflecting the strength of our performance and continuing confidence 
in our long term growth, we are proposing a final dividend of 6.2c, 
taking the total dividend for the year to 9.0c, up 29% on last year.
Markets
We used the strength of our oil & gas and power markets in 2008 to 
enhance our differentiation and further develop and internationalise 
our activities, and won a number of important new contracts. 
Engineering & Production Facilities strengthened its position in both 
its traditional markets, and in some new international markets. Well 
Support continued to increase revenue and margins in a competitive 
marketplace, develop new products and services, and increase the 
efficiency of its manufacturing operations. Gas Turbine Services 
continued its programme of developing the technology and engineering 
of new spare parts for the overhaul and repair of additional engine 
types, thus enhancing our differentiation and developing our market 
positions in both the oil & gas and power markets.
The world recession, volatile financial markets and exchange 
rates, and much lower oil and gas prices are expected to lead to 
a 10-15% reduction in global E&P expenditure and a decrease in 
service company activity. This, along with the impact of the stronger

dollar on our non US dollar earning stream, will affect our shorter 
term reported performance to some extent. However, there are 
opportunities and we are working with a number of customers on 
cost reduction and efficiency improvements, areas in which Wood 
Group has great experience and strength. Larger customers appear 
to be continuing to make major project investment decisions based 
on the strongly prevailing view that oil and gas prices will increase 
significantly in the medium term. Operators around the world are 
finding it difficult to grow their reserves with ageing reservoirs, 
high depletion rates and the growing complexity and cost of new 
developments. These reserves are often located in countries with 
higher levels of political and economic uncertainty and we have 
a long track record of managing operations in such countries. 
The International Energy Agency “IEA” is forecasting $8 trillion 
in oil & gas exploration investment between now and 2030. A 
significant proportion of this will be in large deepwater and subsea 
developments, areas in which Wood Group is a world leader. We 
also believe we can use our growing knowledge and expertise 
in both carbon capture and storage and renewables to help our 
customers meet their growing environmental and climate change 
objectives.
Overall, around 55% of our business
 (a)
 is linked to supporting 
production and operations which is less sensitive to lower oil prices.
The current market provides opportunities as well as challenges. 
Through innovative and creative solutions, we are working with our 
customers to meet the challenge of much lower commodity prices
in the short term and, at the same time, will be very well placed to 
support the significant investment that will be applied as commodity 
prices strengthen. 
Strategy
Our strategy is to achieve long term sustainable growth by adding 
value to our customers’ operations with world leading, highly 
differentiated products and services. Our strategy has four strands 
which are:
•	 	 to	maintain	a	good	balance	between	field	developments	and	
later cycle production support
•	 	 to	gr ow	and	maintain	market	leading	positions	based	on	
differentiated know-how
•	 	 to	develop	longer	term	customer	r elationships,	often	thr ough	
performance based contracts, and
•	 	 to	extend	our	services	and	br oaden	our	inter national	pr esence.
We believe this strategy positions us well through the oil & gas cycle, 
with good defensive qualities well balanced with opportunities for 
growth. Our strong balance sheet position and recently extended
bank facilities will enable us to continue to make value enhancing 
acquisitions and organic investments in order to emerge stronger 
from the downturn.
People
We continue to make real progress in our objective of being an 
employer of choice for quality people, providing them with a 
challenging and interesting work environment in which no one will be 
hurt. We are a global company with a global employment strategy 
and policies, and our focus is on employing, encouraging, training, 
developing and supporting the best quality people, working in a safe 
environment, around the world.
I believe we significantly achieve this and would like to thank, on 
behalf of the Board, all our people whose skills, commitment and 
enthusiasm continue to drive our success and give us confidence 
in our future. I would also like to extend my personal thanks to my 
Board, and to Allister Langlands and his executive management 
team who have led the company very successfully in 2008 and 
have the skills, commitment and expertise to ensure we continue to 
perform in the current more challenging environment.
Outlook
Wood Group’s strong order book, our focus on production support, 
our good international spread and our high quality customer base 
all stand us in good stead in these more challenging markets. The 
current market provides opportunities as well as challenges and we 
are focused on delivering innovative and creative solutions to achieve 
cost reduction and efficiency improvements for our customers. 
Longer term, we believe the fundamentals for oil & gas services 
remain strong and we are well positioned to capitalise on our high 
differentiation and market leading positions to deliver good growth.

Operating and financial highlights
Review of 2008
Group revenue grew 18% to $5.2bn, reflecting strong growth in 
Engineering & Production Facilities and Well Support, and relatively 
flat revenue in Gas Turbine Services. The strong growth in Engineering 
& Production Facilities was driven by increased activity across all 
sectors in Engineering, and by the continuing strong demand for our 
Production Facilities activities in the North Sea and in international 
markets. In Well Support, activity levels were good through 2008 in all 
three businesses and we continued to grow our international revenue 
outside the US. In Gas Turbine Services, a good increase in underlying 
revenue was offset by the divestment of non core businesses and 
lower revenue from fast track power package contracts.

Group EBITA margin increased from 7.2% to 8.4%, reflecting 
the strengthening of margins in all divisions. The Engineering & 
Production Facilities margin increased due to improvements in the 
underlying margins for both Engineering and for Production Facilities 
activities, combined with the mix benefit of our higher margin 
Engineering activities now representing 48% (2007: 44%) of division 
revenue. In Well Support we saw a continuing increase in overall 
margin, benefiting from revenue growth and our investment in higher 
margin products and services. In Gas Turbine Services our ongoing 
initiatives to increase the amount of work performed under longer 
term contracts, changes in the mix towards higher margin activities, 
the divestment of non core activities and a focus on cost reduction 
and efficiency all contributed to the improvement in margin. 
People
2008 has seen a tremendous year of growth in the number of people 
working at Wood Group. Total headcount increased by 17% to 
28,800 people worldwide. We remain focused on striving to become 
the employer of choice across all of our businesses. We recognise 
that attracting, developing, and retaining the best talent enables us 
to provide world class services and products to our customers and 
growth for our shareholders.
Safety 
In 2008 we saw a 15% improvement in the frequency of all injuries to 
3.3 cases per million man hours. This was achieved through a series of  
pro-active initiatives with a focus on leading performance indicators. 
Our lost work case frequency “LWCF” also improved by 27% to 
1.1 cases per million man hours, reflecting a decrease in severity 
of injuries. We are committed to achieving the highest standards of 
safety in everything that we do and around the world we have won 
recognition for the performance that we have achieved. Continuous 
improvement is a key measure of our success and is given the highest 
priority. We believe we will be successful when no one is hurt.
Looking into 2009
Engineering & Production Facilities has entered 2009 with a strong 
order book. In Engineering, we believe that our differentiated 
capabilities, order book and prospects, market leading positions and 
high quality customer base help position us well. Production Facilities 
activity is largely driven by customers’ operating expenditure, with 
around 70% of revenue based on longer term contracts. A number 
of our new contracts began in the last quarter of 2008 and this will 
provide a good contribution in 2009. In Well Support we have already 
taken decisive management action in light of the challenging outlook 
in the US gas market. International activities outside the US are over 
50% of Well Support’s revenue, which will also provide support in 
2009. Gas Turbine Services continues to be the leading independent 
maintenance provider for industrial gas turbines, with around 85% of 
revenue derived from operational support activity, and we anticipate 
a resilient aftermarket performance in 2009. 
2009 will be a more challenging year for our industry due to the 
weakness in oil and gas prices and global economies. In light of 
this, we remain flexible, carefully controlling costs and managing our 
working capital. We have a strong balance sheet, have extended our 
bank facilities to 2012 and are well positioned to take advantage of 
opportunities for acquisitions and organic investment which are likely 
to emerge in this more challenging market.
Our 2009 reported earnings are likely to be impacted by the strength 
of the US dollar reducing our reported non US dollar earnings 
stream.  However, in overall terms, the majority of the Group’s profit 
is in US dollars, therefore this has a net benefit to shareholders in our 
currency of listing.
We remain confident in the longer term fundamentals of our key 
markets and are continuing to execute our long term growth strategy.

Engineering
Upstream activities represent around 40% of Engineering revenue 
and 12% of Group revenue. We continue to develop our market 
leading positions in deepwater engineering and lightweight topsides 
and in engineering for the in situ oil sands market. The developments 
on which we work are typically longer term, complex projects and 
have the potential to add meaningfully to our customers’ reserve 
bases. We work predominantly with International Oil Companies 
“IOCs”, National Oil Companies “NOCs” and large independents 
and during the period worked on upstream projects for Shell 
(Perdido), ConocoPhillips (Ekofisk), BP (Valhall and Thunderhorse), 
ENI (Nikaitchuq, Alaska), Hess Corporation (Pony), Statoil (Peregrino, 
Brazil and Leismer, Canada), Encana (Foster Creek), Tullow (Uganda) 
and Modec (Ghana).
Subsea engineering, pipelines and midstream represents around 
30% of Engineering and 9% of Group revenue. We consolidated 
our market leading position with the acquisition of MCS during 
the year, a global subsea engineering consultancy with a market 
leading position in riser & mooring design, and a leading offering 
of advanced engineering and software solutions to the subsea 
industry. Along with other Group companies J P Kenny, Multiphase 
Solutions Inc. and Ionik Consulting, MCS is now part of the Subsea 
& Pipelines Technology business group, which is the largest of 
its kind in the world. Our customer base includes IOCs, NOCs 
and large independents and we are working with customers such 
as BP (various projects under a global framework agreement), 
Chevron (Gorgon), Shell (Gumusut-Kakap, Malaysia), Total/Statoil/
Gazprom (Shtokman) and Woodside (Pluto) to develop large longer 
term projects with meaningful reserves. The onshore pipeline 
group has been busy connecting new oil and gas developments to 
consumers, working with Williams (various compressor stations), 
Cairn (Rajasthan, India), Kinder Morgan (various pipelines) and Rocky 
Mountain Express. During the year we were awarded the FEED 
contract for Masdar’s Carbon Capture and Storage “CCS” project 
in the United Arab Emirates, which is an area where we see good 
future growth. We have also been involved in a number of floating 
LNG studies for Petronras, Teekay and BW Offshore.
Downstream, process and industrial represents around 30% of 
Engineering and 9% of Group revenue. Environmental legislation, 
upgrades and heavy oil modifications have meant that our refining 
business had a successful year performing work for CCRL 
(Saskatchewan project), Tesoro, Valero and Citgo. The automation 
group has been active on work for ExxonMobil in Singapore and 
various projects for Chevron and ConocoPhillips. 
Production Facilities
Our activities in the North Sea, where we are the largest 
maintenance, modifications and operations contractor, represent 
60% of Production Facilities revenue and 19% of Group revenue. 
We operate under long term contracts with customers such as 
Apache, BP , Hess, Shell, Talisman and Total providing them with 
ongoing engineering, operations support, production enhancement 
and asset integrity services. In addition we have grown a significant 
duty holder business during the year, providing support to the newer 
entrants to the region. Our duty holder installations now include the 
Beatrice offshore complex and wind farm, the onshore terminal at 
Nigg, Venture’s Hummingbird FPSO and the four TAQA platforms – 
Tern, Eider, North Cormorant and Cormorant Alpha. Looking ahead, 
we will continue to adapt and develop our service provision as the 
market evolves. 
Our international activities, which make up 40% of Production 
Facilities and 12% of Group revenue, continued to perform well. 
We continue to be active under longer term contracts in Algeria, 
Brunei, Colombia, Equatorial Guinea, Indonesia, Peru and Trinidad. 
We enhanced our position in the US with the acquisition of PAC in 
January 2008, extending our significant Gulf of Mexico presence 
into the support of the US onshore production market. In August 
2008 we acquired M&O Global, a provider of industrial safety and 
emergency response training. M&O will help us to further support a 
broad range of international customers, especially NOCs, in training 
and developing their local workforces. In the Middle East we entered 
into a joint venture with Consolidated Contractors Company “CCC”, 
an international construction company with a market leading position 
in the region, in order to provide operations and maintenance 
services in the region. 
Engineering & Production Facilities outlook
In Engineering & Production Facilities, we entered 2009 with a strong 
order book. We believe that in upstream the deepwater sector 
will remain active, although some delays are expected in oil sands 
developments. Subsea and offshore pipeline spending is expected 
to be robust and onshore pipeline demand is anticipated to remain 
high. In our downstream activities the levels of regulatory work are 
expected to remain strong in 2009, with significant activity required 
by customers to meet MSAT2 clean air regulations by 2011. 
Automation, which focuses on efficiency benefits for customers, 
continues to be very active. We have a high quality flexible resource 
across Engineering and have already taken action to keep utilisation 
levels high. Current markets will also provide opportunities for quality 
FEED work and fit for purpose engineering, as our clients look for 
efficiency improvements. 
Production Facilities, with around 70% of revenue under longer term 
contracts and a focus on the support of ongoing production, has 
relatively lower sensitivity to the oil price. We have consolidated our 
market leading position in the North Sea and expanded our scope 
with new entrants, which will provide an important contribution in 
2009. Internationally, we continue to see good scope for growth and 
expansion into new markets, particularly where there is limited local 
capability. We continue to offer performance contracting solutions 
to add value to our customers and have recently taken a number of 
steps to respond to cost challenges.

Electric Submersible Pumps
Our ESP business represents around 50% of Well Support and 
around 9% of Group revenue. Our business is mainly driven by the 
operating expenditure of customers and the need for artificial lift in 
new and mature oil reservoirs. Approximately 25% of our revenue 
comes from the US where we have a market leading position 
in the sale, operation and service of ESPs used for production 
enhancement through artificial lift. The remaining 75% of our revenue 
comes from outside the US where we typically have longer term 
contracts and a strong IOC and NOC customer base. Examples of 
projects worked on in 2008 include pay for performance contracts in 
Africa and the Middle East. 
Pressure Control 
Our Pressure Control business represents around 35% of Well 
Support and around 7% of Group revenue. Our business is driven 
primarily by the gas drilling activity of our customers. In the US, 
where we generated around 60% of our revenue in 2008, we believe 
we are now the largest provider of surface valves and wellheads. 
Increasing levels of rig activity for most of 2008 and high depletion 
rates in unconventional gas developments contributed to strong 
activity levels and demand for our services. Internationally, where 
around 40% of revenue is generated, we continue to expand our 
business under longer term contracts with IOC and NOC customers. 
Examples of key projects worked on in 2008 include for Sinopec in 
China, Aramco in Saudi Arabia and Pemex in Mexico.  
Logging Services 
Our Logging Services business represents around 15% of Well 
Support and 3% of Group revenue. Our development focused 
electric wireline services and production focused slickline services 
both performed well. In recent years we have expanded our capacity 
and opened new bases which have helped us develop a strong 
position in value added services. During the year we have worked 
on projects for operators in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico, Pan 
American in Argentina and several US based independents on 
onshore shale developments.   
Well Support outlook
2009 will be a challenging year for Well Support, with the number 
of active rigs operating in the US significantly reduced. In Pressure 
Control, which is primarily focused on gas developments, the 
reduction in drilling activity means the outlook is more demanding 
and we expect significant volume decreases and pricing pressure. 
In Logging Services, the market outlook is similarly challenging, 
although we have an element of production related revenue. In 
ESP , our strong production related content, good international 
exposure and flexible approach to market should lead to a robust  
performance. We have already taken decisive management action 
to reduce SG&A, achieve supply chain efficiencies and to reduce 
headcount significantly in all three businesses as market activity has 
changed, particularly in North America.

People 4,100 3,700 +11%
Operating and financial highlights
Gas Turbine Services revenue was unchanged in the period, with a 
14% increase in underlying revenue being offset by the divestment of 
non core businesses and lower fast track power solutions revenue. 
The increase in EBITA margin from 6.7% to 7.6% was as a result of 
ongoing initiatives to increase the amount of work performed under 
longer term contracts, changes in the mix towards higher margin 
activities, the divestment of non core activities and a focus on cost 
reduction and efficiency. 
We have increased the amount of revenue generated under longer 
term contracts from 39% to 41%. We continue to focus on increasing 
the breadth of our core activities, adding further new product capability 
and providing customer focused solutions. We now have over 4,100 
people, serving customers in over 100 countries.

Oil & gas 
Our oil & gas activities support turbines that are used for power 
generation, gas compression and transmission and represent 
around one third of Gas Turbine Services revenue. Through our OEM 
licensed joint ventures we have broad technical capabilities and 
know how, a strong service culture and a market leading share of 
the aftermarket for aero-derivative gas turbines. Most of the installed 
turbines on which we work are linked to existing production and 
therefore have relatively lower sensitivity to oil and gas prices. During 
2008 we were active on an increasing number of turbines for NOCs 
including Petrobras, Pemex and Petronas and our newly formed 
Asset Management Solutions “AMS” group secured longer term 
rotating equipment contracts with TAQA in the North Sea and Total 
in the Netherlands. Our light industrial turbine activities continued 
to grow and increased market share through success in developing 
new products and penetrating new regions.
Power
Our power activities provide support for turbines that are used for 
power generation and industrial applications, and represent around 
two thirds of Gas Turbine Services revenues. Demand for our 
services is driven by the maintenance budgets of customers. Recent 
reductions in the gas price have made gas a more cost effective 
input for power generation and in the longer term the environmental 
benefits of gas relative to other fossil fuels mean that it is forecast 
to gain an increasing share of generating capacity. During 2008 we 
were active on a large number of projects including those for NYPA, 
Suez and Duke.
There are power shortages in the developing world and in parts of 
the developed world where distribution networks are insufficient to 
take power to where it is needed. This has led to demand for fast 
track power solutions where we have a competitive advantage in 
our ability to locate, refurbish, install, operate, warrant and maintain 
equipment. During 2008 we made equipment sales into the Middle 
East and South America and we successfully completed the fast 
track power projects for American Electric Power “AEP” which 
commenced in 2007. We also secured three relocation projects in 
Texas, one for El Paso Electric and two for East Texas Electric  
Co-operative “ETEC” which will be executed in 2009. 
Gas Turbine Services outlook
We anticipate that demand for our oil & gas related maintenance, 
repair & overhaul services will remain robust in 2009, due to its 
production focussed nature and the longer term contracts we have 
in place. We have a good spread of business with NOCs, IOCs 
and large independents. In the power market there may be some 
regional short term weakness, as certain customers look to defer 
maintenance but in the longer term, demand for power, and in 
particular gas turbine generated power, is expected to increase, 
leading to strong ongoing demand for our services. We continue to 
focus on initiatives to increase the amount of business under longer 
term contracts, expand our regional and customer portfolio, divest 
of non core businesses and reduce costs. Overall we anticipate 
a resilient aftermarket performance. The outlook for our fast track 
power package activities is being impacted by the continuing tight 
credit markets, although we currently see strong enquiry levels.

Financial review
Alan Semple, 
Group Finance Director
Measuring our performance – We use a variety of key 
performance measures to evaluate the Group’s financial 
performance. These include earnings before interest, 
tax and amortisation “EBITA” and adjusted diluted 
earnings per share “EPS” to measure the profitability of 
the business, along with other metrics such as Return 
on Capital Employed “ROCE” and Operating Capital 
Employed to Revenue “OCER” which measure how 
efficiently we use capital. These metrics are included 
in the Group’s senior management incentive schemes, 
alongside strategy, people development and safety 
measures.

A detailed review of our trading performance is contained within the 
divisional reviews on pages 20 to 25. 
Amortisation
The amortisation charge of $25.2m includes $11.9m (2007: $2.0m) of 
amortisation relating to other intangible assets arising from acquisitions, 
most notably $8.1m from the purchase of IMV in November 2007. 
There was a full year of IMV amortisation in 2008 compared to only  
one month in 2007.

Finance expense
The net finance expense in the period of $31.7m is made up of 
interest expense of $37.7m (2007: $32.7m) (including deemed 
interest) and interest income of $6.0m (2007: $7.4m). 
The net finance expense is higher than 2007 due to higher average 
levels of net debt in the period, combined with a charge of $4.0m 
(2007: $1.4m) relating to the accounting treatment of deferred 
consideration payments.
Taxation 
The movement in the tax charge is outlined below –

Foreign exchange
The Group’s EBITA is impacted in a number of ways by movements 
in foreign exchange rates, including the effect of retranslating foreign 
currency results at different average rates year to year. Given the 
material strengthening in the US dollar over recent months, a number 
of current foreign exchange rates are significantly different from the 
average rates for 2008. The table below sets out the impact on 2008 
EBITA had current exchange rates applied. Also set out below is the 
impact of the movement of exchange rates on our Sterling equivalent 
earnings, as this is the currency in which our shares are traded.

As the majority of the Group’s profit is generated in US dollars, a 
stronger US dollar has a net benefit for shareholders in our currency 
of listing. The impact of retranslating the 2008 reported EBITA at 
current rates would be to reduce reported EBITA by 8%, but in 
Sterling equivalent terms EBITA would have increased by 17%.

$140.2m, or 36%, to $534.5m. The strong overall revenue growth 
of $810.4m contributed to working capital outflows during the year 
of $181.0m (2007:$55.3m) made up of an increase of $104.1m in 
inventories and of $298.3m in trade and other receivables, partly offset 
by an increase of $221.4m in trade and other payables. The inventory 
figure includes a planned increase in Gas Turbine Services turbine

Net debt
Net debt at 31 December 2008 decreased by $29.1m to $248.8m. 
This represents strong cash flow from operations and the positive 
impact of the retranslation of foreign currency borrowings, offset by the 
investment in capex, intangible assets and acquisitions. 
2008 248.8
2007 277.9
2006 257.9
2005 245.8
2004 354.3
Long term borrowings amounted to $390.7m (2007: $349.9m)  
with interest payable at variable rates. Interest rate swaps have  
been entered into in respect of $166.5m (2007: $175.0m), or 43% 
(2007: 50%) of total long term borrowings, and these have the effect 
of converting the borrowings to fixed rates of interest with maturities 
ranging from 2009 to 2013. 
The Group’s borrowings are predominantly denominated in US dollars, 
Sterling, Euros and Canadian dollars. Whenever practical, foreign 
currency borrowings are used to hedge the Group’s net investment in 
non US dollar entities.
Credit facilities 
At 31 December 2008 the Group had unutilised borrowing facilities 
of $632.0m (2007: $474.4m) representing 60% (2007: 55%) of total 
borrowing facilities. Since the year end, our bilateral facilities have been 
extended to 2012 with the potential for two, one year extensions. This 
results in total borrowing facilities of $1,056.9m.
In addition the Group has a number of facilities covering the issue of 
bonds, guarantees and letters of credit amounting to $236.0m (2007: 
$257.7m).

Financial risk management
The Group Treasury department is responsible for managing debt, 
cash balances and the risks arising from interest rate and currency 
movements within an approved policy framework. The Group’s 
overall risk management strategy is to hedge exposures wherever 
practical in order to minimise any potential impact on the Group’s 
financial performance. The policy does not allow speculative 
transactions to be undertaken. Full details of financial instruments 
used are provided in note 18 to the financial statements. 
Credit risk 
The Group’s credit risk primarily relates to its trade receivables which 
are generally with customers who have strong credit ratings assigned 
by international credit rating agencies. Reflecting in part higher levels 
of political and economic uncertainty in certain markets and in part 
the risk that the downturn in the global economy could lead to a 
slowing of payments from customers and a risk of non payment in 
the event of customer insolvency, the Group has increased its focus 
on credit risk and credit management and appropriate measures 
have been implemented to reduce our risk profile where possible. 
Further details on receivables and credit risk are provided in notes 13 
and 18 to the financial statements.
Pensions 
The majority of the Group’s pension arrangements are on a 
defined contribution basis. The Group operates one UK defined 
benefit scheme which had 404 active members and 828 deferred, 
pensionable deferred or pensionable members at 31 December 
2008. At 31 December 2008 the scheme had a deficit of $23.1m 
(2007: $11.3m).
In assessing the potential liabilities, judgement is required to 
determine the assumptions around future salary and pension 
increases, inflation, investment returns and member longevity. 
Future benefits under the scheme are provided on a Career Average 
Revalued Earnings “CARE” basis. 
Full details of pension assets and liabilities are provided in note 30 to 
the Group financial statements. 
Acquisitions and disposals 
In January 2008 the Group acquired Producers Assistance 
Corporation “PAC”. The acquisition of PAC provides the Group with a 
wider presence in the support of onshore US production. 
The Group completed the acquisition of M&O Global in August 2008, 
expanding our capability in safety and emergency response training. 
In September 2008, the Group acquired MCS, a global subsea 
engineering consultancy with a market leading position in riser & 
mooring design, and a leading offering of advanced engineering and 
software solutions to the subsea industry. The acquisition of MCS is 
part of our ongoing strategy to expand and enhance our capabilities 
in subsea and deepwater.
The Group also made small disposals during the year. Further details 
of the acquisitions and disposals are provided in note 28 of the 
financial statements.

for 2008 before adjusting for profit on disposal of interest in 
joint venture of $ nil (2007:$3.6m), impairment and restructuring 
charges of $ nil (2007: $26.2m) and amortisation of $25.2m 
(2007: $10.6m). This financial term is provided as it is a key unit 
of measurement used by the Group in the management of its 
business.
2.  Return on Capital Employed is EBITA divided by average equity 
plus average net debt and excludes businesses to be disposed.
3.  Operating Capital Employed to Revenue “OCER” is Operating 
Capital Employed (property, plant and equipment,intangible 
assets (excluding intangibles recognised on acquisition), 
inventories and trade and other receivables less trade and other 
payables) divided by Revenue.
4.  Shares held by the Group’s employee share ownership trusts are 
excluded from the number of shares in calculating earnings per 
ordinary share. Adjusted diluted earnings per ordinary share is 
based on the diluted number of shares, taking account of share 
options where the effect of these is dilutive. Adjusted diluted 
earnings per ordinary share is calculated on earnings before 
amortisation, impairment and restructuring charges and profit  
on disposal of interest in joint venture, net of tax.
5.   ‘Cases’ refers to TRCF Total recordable case frequency 
(LWC+RWC+MTC) per million manhours

RWC Restricted work case 
MTC Medical treatment case
6. Number of employees and contractors at 31 December 2008.
7.  Dividend cover is adjusted diluted earnings per ordinary share 
divided by the total dividend per ordinary share for the period.
8. 2008 US dollar results translated at current exchange rates are 
calculated by translating the underlying local currency amounts 
to US dollars at current exchange rates. The exchange rate used 
for Sterling was £1=$1.45 and other currencies were translated 
using rates applying in February 2009.
9. The Sterling equivalent of the 2008 actual results is calculated 
by translating the US dollar results at the average Sterling to 
US dollar exchange rate for the year of £1=$1.85. The Sterling 
equivalent of the retranslated 2008 results is calculated by 
translating the amounts to Sterling at the exchange rate of 
£1=$1.45.
10.  Gearing is net debt divided by total shareholders’ equity.
11.  Interest cover is EBITA divided by net finance costs.

Mustang 4th in Houston’s best places to work listing
In June, Mustang Engineering was ranked 4th on the ‘Best Places to 
Work’ survey among 140 Houston companies with 501+ employees 
and was the only project management and engineering company 
named on the list. The survey, carried out by the Houston Business 
Journal, was based on a confidential 37-question survey of Houston 
based employees reflecting attitudes about their employer and the 
workplace.
Steve Knowles, President of Mustang commented, “This is a wonderful 
honour for Mustang and is reflective of being People Oriented… 
Project Driven®, a philosophy that permeates all aspects of our culture 
and operations. We constantly strive to keep a small company, family 
feel despite our tremendous growth”.

Training & development
We are committed to attracting and keeping the highest calibre people. Our many training 
and development programmes are designed to enable our staff to learn new skills and refine 
existing ones.
Our people
We want our people to enjoy their work and feel they have the skills 
needed to do their job to the best of their ability. Our training and 
development programmes are tailored to our employees’ long term 
career objectives and the needs of our business.
In 2008 our Group led training initiatives supplemented business 
unit programmes and provided a positive learning environment 
for our people where ideas were discussed openly. Launched in 
2004, our Management Development Programme “MDP” now 
has over 400 alumni, 95% of whom remain with the Group. Our 
Financial Development Programme “FDP”, a continuing professional 
development programme for our senior financial professionals is 
now in its fifth year. Managing People Effectively “MPE” is aimed at 
supervisors, managers and technical professionals. It provides them 
with an opportunity to practise and develop the required skills to 
become more effective managers of people.
In a business which employs many engineers and technical 
specialists we recognised the need to develop skills and 
understanding of non technical areas, in particular finance. Our 
Understanding Business Finance course was introduced enabling 
participants in non financial roles to effectively use financial tools in 
their business planning and decision making processes.
We also saw significant growth in learning through training 
development and competency programmes across our businesses 
worldwide. These included, Rolls Wood Group apprentice scheme in 
the UK, Equipo Abilities System in Colombia and our SQV accredited 
Competence Assurance System in Trinidad. We also continue to 
develop the J P Kenny Academy, which is setting new competency 
standards around the world and the ‘Out in Front’ employee 
development programme in our North Sea business, which provides 
opportunities to emerging leaders. 
We take an international approach to supporting academic research 
and engineering education, working with a number of universities.
Canada – sponsoring “The Wood Group Chair in Offshore 
Engineering for Arctic and Harsh Environments” at Memorial 
University, Newfoundland.
UK – we launched a five-year scholarship project programme, in 
conjunction with Talisman, to support the career development of 
students at the Robert Gordon University “RGU”, Aberdeen.
United Arab Emirates – supporting engineering students at 
the Dubai campus of Heriot Watt University through Energy 
Excellence Awards.
Kazakhstan – established a Professorial chair at the Kazakhstan 
British Technical University “KBTU” in Almaty.
Australia – supporting students on the offshore pipeline design 
course at the University of Western Australia.

Health
As an integral part of our business we will 
maintain a healthy workplace.
Promoting and enhancing health and wellbeing is an integral part of our 
Vision for HSE Excellence. We are committed to reducing instances of 
occupational illness, reducing sickness & absenteeism and increasing 
awareness of healthy lifestyle options.
Les Thomas is the Director with Group responsibility for Health, Safety 
and the Environment “HSE”. We aim to continually improve the quality 
of occupational health management by controlling more effectively 
the health risks arising from our activities and promoting the benefit 
of healthy lifestyles for our employees via campaigns and health fairs.  
In 2008 we continued to develop practices focused on issues such 
as asbestos, vibration white finger, malaria, health promotion and 
wellbeing.
Hand Arm Vibration Syndrome “HAVS”
Since the introduction of a HAVS awareness programme in 2005 
we have seen an 82%* fall in the number of reported cases. The 
programme has been rolled out across the UK and is designed to 
ensure that all relevant personnel are aware of the risks of HAVS and 
the measures that can be taken to reduce these risks.
Onsite health centre
More than 3,000 employees in the Houston area are benefiting from 
an onsite health centre. The centre offers employees and their families 
a health care benefit that is convenient, tailored to their needs and 
affordable.
Health fairs
The annual Health & Fitness Fair for Wood Group employees based 
in Scotland was attended by more than 250 employees. Attractions 
included health checks and advice from medical professionals on 
issues including diet, exercise, UV sun damage, smoking cessation 
and alcohol awareness.
Safety
We will be successful when no one is 
hurt… and we remain committed to further 
improvement.

TRCF is the frequency of all reportable injuries, including medical

time away from work. Both frequencies are measured per million hours 
worked.
In 2008 we saw a reduction in TRCF of 15% compared to 2007. This 
was achieved through a series of initiatives, with a focus on leading 
performance indicators. Our LWCF also reduced by 27%, compared 
with 2007, reflecting a decrease in the severity of injuries.
In line with our Vision for HSE excellence we are committed to 
continuous improvement. During 2009 we aim to achieve a further 
reduction in the frequency of safety incidents.

HSE Global Conferences
One of the ways we drive continuous improvement is to share best 
practice across the Group. A key mechanism for this has been 
regional HSE conferences. In 2008 over 500 senior managers and 
HSE professionals attended regional HSE conferences in Aberdeen, 
Houston, Bogotá, Abu Dhabi and Singapore.
Frontline Focus
We have introduced Frontline Focus to address immediate 
priorities for improving safety where the risks are greatest. Frontline 
Focus aims to spread best practice to all corners of the Group by 
directing management time, energy and effort to the frontline of our 
operations.
As with existing HSE programs, activities will be tailored in each 
organisation and location to address the needs of each business. 
Examples of areas of focus in 2009 will include: safety leadership 
training, joint customer and Wood Group site visits and audits, 
security & emergency response exercises.

Carbon Footprint Pilot Programme
The Group has launched an initiative to measure the carbon footprint 
across a range of businesses, so that we can identify opportunities 
to reduce carbon emissions. The key objectives of the pilot are to – 
•	 	 put	in	place	appr opriate	pr ocesses	and	pr ocedur es	to	gather	the	
necessary data in a consistent and robust manner
•	 	 complete	a	baseline	assessment	for	2008	using	the	UK’ s	Carbon

We have obtained the ISO 14001 certification for ten of our 
businesses, and use it as a basis for our environmental processes 
around the Group. 
One of the main ways in which we can have a positive impact on the 
environment is through helping our customers to reduce their impact. 
During the year we have been involved in several environmental 
projects, for example – 
•	 	 fr ont	end	engineering	design	“FEED”	services	for	Masdar’ s	
Carbon Capture & Storage “CCS” project in the United Arab

Our framework of CSR reporting
Community & social
Caring for our communities is important to us 
and we encourage all our people to engage in 
community projects at a local level.
In 2008 we continued to support an extensive range of local and 
international charities spanning health, education, the arts, and the 
prevention and reduction of poverty.
We have a well established Employee Community Fund supporting 
charities and fundraising efforts involving our employees around the 
world.
As part of a team building programme, managers from several 
countries participated in a Build-a-Bike project. More than 20 bikes 
were delivered to deserving children in the community.
Mustang was presented the 2008 Star Award by the West Houston 
Chamber of Commerce. The award recognises businesses who have 
contributed to the community both in economic development and 
social responsibility.  
Children in Colombia enjoyed a Christmas gift thanks to the generosity 
of Wood Group employees from around the world. Donations from 
Australia, Norway, Spain, Qatar, the UK, and the US provided gift bags 
for families in Colombia. Each of the 74 children received a sweater, a 
pair of trousers, toys, fruit juice, a cake and sweets. Their mothers also 
received a gift bag containing essential cooking ingredients.
We are a long term supporter of the annual Aberdeen International 
Youth Festival, the world’s premiere participatory youth arts festival, 
with up to 1,000 participants and over 70 events during a two week 
period.
Ethics
We expect our people to uphold high ethical 
standards wherever in the world our business 
takes them. We also expect those with whom 
we do business to embrace similar values and 
standards.
 
Ensuring compliance
Non-compliance with applicable laws and regulations or ethical 
misconduct could damage our reputation and reduce shareholder 
value.
The Group’s business ethics policy sets out standards of conduct, 
promotes best practice and provides resolution procedures when 
questions arise. The business ethics policy was updated in early 2009. 
The Group Finance Director chairs the Business Ethics Committee 
which comprises senior management representatives from across 
the Group’s operations. The Committee monitors the operation of the 
business ethics policy and works to promote compliance and resolve 
issues.
Telephone helplines and an email address where concerns can be 
raised confidentially are used to encourage personnel to raise ethical 
concerns and questions and report potential violations. The Group 
has a rigorous process for investigating any potential violations 
of its business ethics policy. During 2008 there were a number of 
investigations undertaken and the Group took disciplinary action, 
including 15 terminations, for breaches of ethical standards.

Customer Mix

We seek to maintain a diverse international customer mix. The 
following shows our typical customer type and geographic mix – 
Focus on customer quality 
As part of our commitment to quality we have quality systems in 
place across the Group. Where appropriate, we encourage our 
businesses to adopt formal quality standards and achieve external 
accreditation. Examples from across the Group are given below.
Within Engineering we have been progressing with external 
accreditation of the quality management systems across the 
businesses. Accreditation was achieved in parts of the business in 
2008 and others will follow in 2009.
Within Production Facilities our North Sea business’ Quality 
Management System is fully compliant to ISO 9001:2008 and is 
certified and registered by BSi Management Systems, a UKAS 
accredited organisation. BSi, as our certification body, visits and 
assesses our systems twice a year and we recently successfully 
completed our first 2009 assessment, which included transition and 
certification to the revised ISO 9001 standard 2008 edition.
In Well Support we have obtained, or are in the process of attaining, 
API certification for our two manufacturing plants in China. Our Tianjin 
facility has had API level 2 accreditation since 2005 and during 2008 
received the highest level of accreditation, level 4. Our new facility in 
Suzhou has been through the process to receive level 4 accreditation 
and is anticipating approval in 2009.
Gas Turbine Services is undertaking a global program to improve 
delivered quality and customer satisfaction through business process 
efficiency improvements and the deployment of standardised lean 
tools. One of the programme’s objectives is to halve the number of 
quality escapes year on year and this was achieved in 2008.
Our shareholders
We seek to ensure that stakeholders, analysts 
and financial media are well informed of our 
strategy, results and financial outlook through 
clear and timely communication.
Significant shareholders (>3% shareholdings) 
The Company has been notified, in accordance with Section 793 of 
the Companies Act 2006 and DTR 5.1.2R, of the following interests

The Group places considerable importance on communication with 
all shareholders, both institutional and private, and maintains open 
channels of communication with shareholders, fund managers and 
analysts. To allow the Group an insight into shareholder needs and 
perceptions of the Group, the Group’s brokers are invited to make an 
annual presentation to the Board.
During 2008, investor roadshows were held covering the UK, Europe 
and the US. In addition, an investor and analyst presentation was 
held in November 2008 which allowed analysts and investors to 
meet with the Group Directors responsible for all divisions and hear 
an update on their businesses. Non-executive directors are offered 
the opportunity to attend meetings with major shareholders. The 
AGM, which will be held on 13 May 2009, is a valuable opportunity 
for shareholders to have face to face contact with the Board and to 
raise any questions they may have. 
The senior independent director is available to meet with 
shareholders to discuss any areas of concern that cannot be 
resolved through normal channels of investor communication, and 
arrangements for this can be made through the Company Secretary.

Governance
Corporate governance
Statement of Compliance 
This report has been prepared in accordance with the revised 
Combined Code on Corporate Governance published in 2006 
“the Code” which applies for the period covered by this report. 
The directors consider that the company has complied with the 
provisions of the Code throughout the year ended 31 December 
2008.
The Board is committed to maintaining high standards of corporate 
governance. 
The Code requires the Board to state its reasons for considering a 
non-executive director to be independent if he has served for more 
than nine years. J C Morgan, who has served as a non-executive 
director for more than nine years, will offer himself for re-election 
at the 2009 AGM and annually thereafter in compliance with the 
Code. After careful review the Board believes that J C Morgan is 
independent in character and judgement and that there are no 
relationships or circumstances that are likely to affect, or could 
appear to affect, his judgement. The company is not J C Morgan’s 
primary source of income and he does not participate in any of 
its bonus, option or incentive schemes. J C Morgan’s experience, 
knowledge of the energy sector and long term perspective on the 
Group’s activities and strategy continue to be valuable to the Group 
and contribute significantly to the Board’s deliberations. 
Board of Directors
Composition and independence
At 31 December 2008 the Board comprised fourteen directors, 
made up of seven executive and seven non-executive directors. 
The Board has agreed a division of responsibilities between the 
Chairman and the Chief Executive in compliance with the Code; 
Sir Ian Wood performs the role of Chairman and A G Langlands 
operates as Chief Executive Officer. Dr C Masters is the senior 
independent director. 
J B Renfroe was elected to the Board as an executive director on 
26 February 2008. There is a formal and transparent procedure for 
the appointment of new directors to the Board which involves an 
evaluation of the balance of skills, knowledge and experience of the 
existing Board. Appointments are made on the recommendation of 
the Nominations Committee, following a selection process involving 
the interview of a number of candidates and using the services of 
independent executive search consultants specialising in board level 
recruitment.
The Board considers all of its non-executive directors to be 
independent in character and judgement and that there are no 
relationships or circumstances which are likely to affect, or could 
appear to affect, their judgement. Brief biographies of the directors 
appear on pages 42 and 43. Other than J C Morgan who is subject 
to annual re-election, all directors, executive and non-executive, 
must submit themselves for election at the AGM following their 
appointment and, thereafter, for re-election at least once every three 
years.
Discharge of its responsibilities
The Board met seven times in 2008. Four of the meetings were 
scheduled as two day sessions.
The Board has a schedule of matters specifically reserved for its 
consideration and approval. It is responsible for Group strategy, 
the annual budget, significant acquisitions and the overall system 
of internal control. Executive management is responsible for the 
implementation of Board decisions in these areas and all other 
aspects of managing the business. The Board has received 
detailed presentations from senior management within the Group’s 
businesses during the year in connection with the Board’s review 
of Group strategy, including regular presentations on the Group’s 
current health and safety performance. The Board gave detailed 
consideration to reports on the Group’s systems of internal control 
and presentations were made on specific countries in which the 
Group maintains a significant interest. The Board also receives 
updates on the implementation and enforcement of the Group’s 
Business Ethics Policy.
The Board receives appropriate and timely information from 
management to enable it to perform its duties, including monthly 
reports on financial and operational issues. 
Induction and training
The training needs of directors are periodically discussed at Board 
meetings and briefings arranged on issues relating to corporate 
governance. Newly appointed directors undertake an induction 
process designed to develop their knowledge and understanding of 
the Group’s business. This includes briefing sessions during regular 
Board meetings, visits to Group operating sites and discussion 
of relevant business issues. Upon their appointment, directors 
are advised of their legal and other duties and their obligations 
as directors of a listed company. During the year the Board was 
updated on the new conflicts of interest provisions of the Companies 
Act 2006.
There is a procedure for any director to take independent 
professional advice at the Group’s expense and all directors have 
access to the services of the Company Secretary, who is responsible 
for ensuring that the Board’s procedures are followed. 
Board performance evaluation
In 2008 the Board completed a formal evaluation of its own 
performance and of its committees, individual directors, and of the 
Chairman. This involved directors completing detailed questionnaires, 
the results of which were analysed by the Company Secretary. A 
presentation of the results was made to the full Board. The results 
were discussed both at a full Board meeting and separate meetings 
between each director and the Chairman. The non-executive 
directors, led by the senior independent director, are responsible for 
the performance evaluation of the Chairman, taking into account the 
views of the executive directors.
Conflicts of interest
The company has procedures in place to deal with conflicts of 
interest and these procedures have operated effectively throughout 
the year.  46 John Wood Group PLC Annual Report 2008

Committees of the Board
The Board has delegated some of its responsibilities to committees 
– the Audit Committee, the Remuneration Committee and the 
Nominations Committee. A summary of the work of the Audit 
Committee and the Nominations Committee is set out below, whilst 
the report of the Remuneration Committee is included in the Directors’ 
remuneration report on page 49.
The Committees’ terms of reference are available on the Group’s 
website.

Audit Committee
Committee composition and responsibilities
The Audit Committee comprises four independent non-executive 
directors, Dr. C Masters (Chairman), J C Morgan, I D Marchant and  
D Woodward. 
In line with the requirements of the Code, the Board considers that  
I D Marchant has recent and relevant financial experience. The 
Committee meets at least three times a year, and has written terms  
of reference setting out its roles and responsibilities.
These responsibilities include
•	 reviewing the effectiveness of the Group’s internal financial controls
•	 monitoring the integrity of the Group’s financial statements and its 
interim and preliminary announcements
•	 monitoring and assessing the effectiveness of the Group’s internal 
audit function
•	 reviewing the terms of engagement and independence of the 
external auditors
•	 assessing the audit process and the effectiveness of the external 
auditors to supply non audit services
•	 monitoring the Group policy on the engagement of the external 
auditors to supply non audit services
•	 reporting to the Board, identifying any matters in respect of which 
it considers that action or other improvement is needed and 
making recommendations as to the steps to be taken
 
Discharge of its responsibilities
The Committee met three times in 2008. Attendance at committee 
meetings is at the invitation of the Chairman of the Committee; however 
the Group Finance Director, Group Financial Controller, Head of Internal 
Audit and the external auditors are generally invited to attend. The Head 
of Internal Audit and the external auditors have the right of direct access 
to the Chairman of the Committee at all times and met the Committee 
without management present during 2008.
During the year the Committee –
•	 reviewed the Annual Report for 2007 and the Interim Report for 
2008
•	 reviewed the effectiveness of the Group’s internal financial controls 
•	 discussed with management and the external auditors significant 
issues and areas of financial risk, accounting principles, practices 
and judgements
•	 considered with the external auditors the significant matters arising 
from the annual external audit
•	 reviewed reports prepared by the internal audit function together 
with management’s response and the actions taken
•	 focused on complex or unusual transactions and judgemental 
areas
External auditor independence and non audit services
The Committee has a key oversight role in respect to the engagement 
and ongoing relationship with the Group’s external auditor, 
PricewaterhouseCoopers “PwC”, and has overall responsibility for 
ensuring that the external auditors’ independence and objectivity is not 
compromised.
One of the key risks to external auditor independence is the provision 
of non audit services by the external auditor. The Committee considers 
and approves fees in respect of non audit services provided by the 
external auditors in accordance with the Group’s policy in this area, 
which is set out in the Audit Committee’s terms of reference. The cost of 
non audit services provided in 2008 is reported in note 3 to the financial 
statements. In the opinion of the Committee, the provision of these non 
audit services did not impair PwC’s independence. 
PwC has established policies and procedures to ensure that those 
in a position to influence the conduct of their audit act with integrity, 
objectivity and independence. PwC provides an annual confirmation 
of their independence from the Group and, if there are any, details of 
any relationship between them and the Group which could impact their 
objectivity and independence. No such relationships were noted in 
2008.

Nominations Committee
Committee composition and responsibilities
The Nominations Committee consists of Sir Ian Wood (Chairman) 
and all of the independent non-executive directors. The Committee 
meets at least once a year to review the Board structure, size and 
composition, make recommendations to the Board with regard to 
any changes, to identify and nominate candidates for the approval 
of the Board, to fill Board vacancies and to ensure that succession 
plans are in place.
Discharge of its responsibilities
The Committee met once during 2008. 
Internal Control
The Board is ultimately responsible for the Group’s system of internal 
control and for reviewing its effectiveness.
The Board has established an ongoing process for identifying, 
evaluating and managing the significant risks faced by the Group 
that has been in place for the year under review and up to the date 
of approval of this annual report. The process is regularly reviewed 
by the Board and is in accordance with the revised guidance on 
internal controls published in October 2005 by the Turnbull review 
group: “Internal Control – Revised Guidance for Directors on the 
Combined Code”. The Group, for the purposes of applying the 
Turnbull Committee guidance referred to above, comprises John 
Wood Group PLC, its subsidiaries and joint ventures.
Any system of internal control is designed to manage rather than 
eliminate the risk of failure to achieve business objectives and can 
only provide reasonable and not absolute assurance against material 
misstatement or loss.
The key elements of the ongoing procedures which the directors 
have established to review the effectiveness of the system of internal 
control on an annual basis include the following:
Overall control environment – The Group has a clear organisational 
structure for the control and monitoring of its businesses, including 
defined lines of responsibility and delegation of authority. The Group 
has issued policies which define the standards of business conduct 
and include Contract Risk Management and Review; Health, Safety 
and Environment; and Business Ethics. Consistent with the Business 
Ethics Policy, advice lines have been established to enable staff to 
raise ethical concerns in confidence. For further details please refer 
to the Ethics section of ‘Our business and the community’ on page 
38.
Risk identification and management – The Board formally reviews 
the Group’s exposure to key business risks at least once a year 
including the controls in place and management action plans.  
In addition the Board receives regular updates from management 
on specific risks and actions. Each division’s management team 
is responsible for the process of identification and evaluation of 
significant operational, financial and compliance risks and for the 
design and operation of effective internal controls. For further  
details please refer to ‘Principal risks and uncertainties’ on pages  
30 and 31.
Monitoring of the internal control systems – The Board has 
agreed certain reporting procedures to monitor key risk areas on 
an ongoing basis, including health and safety, legal and financial 
matters. The Audit Committee has been delegated the responsibility 
to review the effectiveness of the internal financial control systems 
implemented by management. It is assisted by the internal auditors 
and, where appropriate, the external auditors. The Chairman of the 
Audit Committee regularly reports to the Board on their discussions.
Information and communication – The Group has a 
comprehensive system for reporting performance to the Board. This 
includes monthly and quarterly reports. The quarterly reports include 
a detailed financial review against budgets, and, twice a year, revised 
forecasts. The executive directors also receive detailed monthly 
financial reports and meet on a monthly basis to discuss financial 
performance and other operational matters. In addition, each division 
held Quarterly Review Meetings “QRMs” involving discussions with 
senior managers and certain of the executive directors, including the 
Chief Executive.
As a result of these ongoing procedures the Boards’ assessment 
was that the internal control environment was operating effectively. 
 
Going concern
The Group’s business activities, together with the factors likely to 
affect its future development, performance and position are set out 
in the Operational Review on pages 6 to 25. The financial position of 
the Group, its cash flows, liquidity position and borrowing facilities 
are described in the Financial Review on pages 26 to 29. In addition, 
note 18 to the financial statements includes the Group’s objectives, 
policies and processes for managing its capital, its financial risk 
management objectives, details of its financial instruments and 
hedging activities, and its exposures to credit risk and liquidity risk.
The Group has considerable financial resources together with the 
cash inflows generated from its existing activities as set out in note 
27 to the financial statements. As a consequence, the directors 
believe that the Group is well placed to manage its business risks 
successfully despite the current uncertain economic outlook. 
Having made the appropriate enquiries including a review of cash 
flow projections and key sensitivities, the directors consider, in 
accordance with the Code, that the business is a going concern. 
Adequate resources exist for the Group to continue in operational 
existence for the foreseeable future. For this reason they continue to 
adopt the going concern basis in preparing the financial statements. 48 John Wood Group PLC Annual Report 2008
Energy Supporting Energy
Statement of directors’ responsibilities
The directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report, the 
Directors’ Remuneration Report and the Group and the parent company 
financial statements in accordance with applicable law and regulations.
Company law requires the directors to prepare financial statements 
for each financial year. Under that law the directors have prepared the 
Group financial statements in accordance with International Financial 
Reporting Standards “IFRSs” as adopted by the European Union, and 
the parent company financial statements in accordance with applicable 
law and United Kingdom Accounting Standards (United Kingdom 
Generally Accepted Accounting Practice). The Group and parent 
company financial statements are required by law to give a true and fair 
view of the state of affairs of the company and the Group and of the 
profit or loss of the Group for that period.
In preparing those financial statements, the directors are required to:
•	 select suitable accounting policies and then apply them 
consistently;
•	 make judgements and estimates that are reasonable and prudent;
•	 state that the Group financial statements comply with IFRSs as 
adopted by the European Union, and with regard to the parent 
company financial statements that applicable UK Accounting 
Standards have been followed, subject to any material departures 
disclosed and explained in the financial statements
The directors are responsible for keeping proper accounting records 
that disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position 
of the company and the Group and to enable them to ensure that the 
financial statements and the Directors’ Remuneration Report comply 
with the Companies Act 1985 and, as regards the Group financial 
statements, Article 4 of the IAS Regulation. They are also responsible for 
safeguarding the assets of the company and the Group and hence for 
taking reasonable steps for the prevention and detection of fraud and 
other irregularities.
The directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity of the 
company’s website. Legislation in the United Kingdom governing the 
preparation and dissemination of financial statements may differ from 
legislation in other jurisdictions.
Each of the directors, whose names and functions are listed on page 42 
and 43, confirms that, to the best of their knowledge:
•	 the Group financial statements, which have been prepared in 
accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the EU, give a true and 
fair view of the assets, liabilities, financial position and profit of the 
Group; and 
•	 the directors’ report on page 44 includes a fair review of the 
development and performance of the business and the position 
of the Group, together with a description of the principal risks and 
uncertainties that it faces.
So far as the directors are aware, there is no relevant audit information 
of which the company’s auditors are unaware. Relevant information is 
defined as “information needed by the company’s auditors in connection 
with preparing their report.” Each director has taken all the steps that he 
ought to have taken as a director in order to make himself aware of any 
relevant audit information and to establish that the company’s auditors 
are aware of that information.

Letter from the Chairman of the Remuneration Committee
Dear Shareholder
The Remuneration Committee “the Committee” keeps under 
regular review the elements of the Wood Group senior management 
remuneration package. Its aim is to achieve a level and a mix which 
represents a fair and competitive reward with an appropriate balance 
between incentive and retention and an ability to attract high quality 
people. The intention of the overall remuneration package is that it 
should deliver pay at around industry median levels for “on target” 
performance, with the potential for top quartile remuneration for 
exceptional performance.
The remuneration structure is base salary plus performance related 
payment elements based on both annual and longer term sets 
of objectives. The base salary is set at a competitive level with 
comparable skill sets and responsibilities in other companies. The 
annual bonus for executive directors is based on delivery of both 
corporate and personal objectives. A new rolling three year Long 
Term Incentive Plan “LTIP” was approved by shareholders in 2007. 
The first cycle under this LTIP runs from 2008 to 2010. A new three 
year cycle commences each year.
The Committee will be particularly conscious of changing market and 
competitive circumstances in considering all aspects of remuneration 
over the coming period. The executive directors have themselves 
proposed that their base salary should be unchanged in 2009 and 
the Committee has accepted this. The Committee will keep under 
careful review the operation of the LTIP for the 2008-10 and 2009-11 
cycles, with the objective of maintaining appropriate incentive and 
maximising alignment with shareholders’ interests.
Additionally, the Committee keeps under review the remuneration 
policy for around 50 managers below executive director level. The 
objectives of the policy here are broadly the same as for executive 
directors, but with targets set to reflect individual manager’s sphere 
of control.

Directors’ remuneration report
Part 1 Executive directors’ remuneration
1a) Remuneration policy
The aim of the Committee is to establish an overall remuneration 
structure which will 
•	 attract, retain and motivate key executives 
•	 reflect the size and complexity of the Group’s business
•	 consider executives’ individual responsibilities and  
geographical location
•	 clearly align remuneration with the Group’s long term strategy  
and maximising shareholder value
•	 consider executive remuneration within the broader setting of pay 
conditions elsewhere within Wood Group  
The Committee aims to reflect best practice wherever possible and, 
in setting remuneration policy, gives full consideration to the relevant 
provisions of the Combined Code and the Directors’ Remuneration 
Report Regulations 2002. 
When considering remuneration policy, the Committee reviews the level 
of rewards that are offered by other companies, including companies 
within comparable sectors and geography as well as companies of 
comparable size and complexity in other sectors. Given that the Group 
operates in specialised and international markets, regard is also given to 
remuneration of peers within the same industry sector, which are often 
based in the US. As directly comparable and precise data for these 
comparator groups is often difficult to obtain, the Committee takes 
advice from the Chairman and the Chief Executive.
As noted above, one of the Committee’s key objectives is to align 
the remuneration of executive directors with the long term strategy 
of the Group and with maximising shareholder value. In order to do 
this remuneration packages comprise fixed elements and variable, 
performance related, elements. The typical total remuneration package 
for each executive director therefore comprises a basic salary and 
benefits, an annual cash bonus, a deferred bonus and participation in 
the Group’s long term incentive schemes. The main elements of each

1c) Basic salary and benefits
Salary levels are reviewed and approved annually by the Committee 
which has decided to accept the proposal from the executive directors 
that their 2009 salaries should remain unchanged at the 2008 levels.
The level of benefits typically provided includes a cash allowance in 
lieu of a company car, private health and dental coverage and some 
directors receive cash payments in lieu of pension benefits above the 
UK scheme specific cap. M Straughen has elected to receive a cash 
payment in lieu of pension payments.
1d) Annual bonus
Annual bonuses are based on a combination of: 
(i)  financial performance (70%) – the Group’s financial 
performance is measured against annual budgets, comprising 
both an EBITA and a capital efficiency measure; and
(ii)  personal objectives (30%) – performance is measured 
annually against agreed personal objectives aimed at 
achievement of the Group’s business goals, HSE targets, 
strategy, people development and other CSR objectives.
The annual bonus is split into a cash component and a deferred 
component. The Committee has set the maximum cash bonus 
potential for executive directors for 2008 and 2009 at 50% of basic 
salary, and it will be paid by 31 March in the following year. 
A deferred bonus equal to the cash bonus is payable when EBITA 
growth over inflation is 5% or greater. A deferred bonus of 50% of the 
cash bonus is payable where EBITA growth over inflation is less than 
5%. All deferred bonuses are deferred for two years and are subject to 
forfeiture in certain circumstances.
Bonus payments are not part of pensionable earnings.
During 2008, achievement of aggregate financial measures was 11% 
above budget and overall individual bonus payments including the 
deferred element ranged from 83% to 91% of base salary.
1e) Long term incentives (audited)
Long term incentive schemes play an important role in the retention 
and motivation of executive directors and senior executives, consistent 
with our goal of achieving shareholder value. In this respect the Group 
has put in place the following long term incentive schemes: 
Long Term Incentive Scheme “LTIS”. Introduced in May 2005 for 
executive directors and around 35 senior executives, the LTIS 
provided incentives for performance over a three year period to 31 
December 2007. Details of the LTIS are provided in note 3c)(i).
The LTIS awards made to the executive directors during the 1 January 
2005 to 31 December 2007 performance cycle are shown in the table

Long Term Incentive Plan “LTIP”. Introduced in April 2007 for executive 
directors and around 35 senior executives, this is a replacement for 
the LTIS above and is designed to provide incentives for three year 
rolling performance cycles commencing 1 January 2008. Details of the 
LTIP are provided in note 3c)(ii). 
Long Term Retention Plan “LTRP”. Introduced in 2003, the LTRP was 
designed to align rewards to financial performance and results in the 
awarding of Wood Group par value options to participants. Since the 
introduction of the LTIS this scheme has primarily been aimed at a 
group of around 350 employees in the layer below those participating 
in the LTIS. Details of the LTRP are provided in note 3c)(iii) and details 
of the awards made are disclosed in 3d).
Executive Share Option Schemes. Established in 2002, the executive 
share option schemes provide for the grant of options to executive 
directors and senior executives. No awards have been made to 
executive directors since 2005. Full details of the executive share 
option schemes are provided in note 3c)(iv) and details of the awards 
made are disclosed in 3d).

schemes. 52 John Wood Group PLC Annual Report 2008

Pension benefits to UK based executive directors
The benefits and terms for the UK based executive directors who are active members of the John Wood Group PLC Retirement Benefit Scheme 
“JWG RBS”, which is a defined benefit pension scheme, are shown in the following table. With effect from 6 April 2007 future benefits within the 
JWG RBS were provided on a Career Average Revalued Earnings “CARE” basis.

L J Thomas 65 7.5% of pensionable salary, subject to pension cap 4 x basic salary 1/60th One-half
A scheme specific pensionable earnings cap of £118,800 was set in April 2008 escalating at Retail Price Index “RPI” plus 1.25% per annum. 
Pension increases are set at the rate of increase in RPI capped at 5% per annum for service from 6 April 1997 to 30 June 2005, and the rate of 
increase in RPI, capped at 2.5% per annum for service from 1 July 2005.
Death in service benefits entitle the surviving spouse or dependants to a pension based on a percentage of that which would have been received at 
normal retirement date based on final pensionable salary at the date of death.
Benefits provided to A G Langlands in excess of the scheme specific pension cap are provided by way of an unfunded, unapproved arrangement. 
Final pensionable salary is capped from 6 April 2008 at £425,000 per annum increasing at RPI plus 1.25%.
M H Papworth and L J Thomas receive a cash contribution in lieu of pension benefits above the scheme specific cap equal to 10% of the difference 
between base salary and the level of pension cap.
M Straughen receives a cash payment of 10% of base salary in lieu of pension provision.
Sir Ian Wood ceased to be an active member of the Scheme during 2007.  
The directors below had the following accrued entitlements under the JWG RBS at 31 December 2008. For A G Langlands the figures include

US based executive directors are entitled to participate in the Wood Group 401k plan which is a defined contribution scheme. In addition they 
are entitled to participate in a Non-Qualified Deferred Compensation Plan which provides a company contribution based upon the level of 
employee deferrals.
A G Semple is provided with a pension arrangement of a defined benefit nature, providing an equivalent level of benefits to that provided in the 
JWG RBS. If he dies in pensionable service, his surviving spouse or dependants are entitled to a pension of half of the pension that would have 
been received at normal retirement date based on the final pensionable salary at the date of death. Final pensionable salary is capped from  
6 April 2008 at $536,562 per annum, increasing at RPI plus 1.25%.
J B Renfroe’s benefits are provided in defined contribution form.  During the year the Group’s contribution on his behalf to a 401k plan amounted 
to $11,500 (2007: nil)
A G Semple and J B Renfroe are provided with life assurance cover of approximately four times basic salary.
1g) Service contracts
Contract date Notice Period
Sir Ian Wood 1 May 2002 12 months
A G Langlands 1 May 2002 12 months
A G Semple 1 May 2002 12 months

L J Thomas 19 May 2004 12 months
It is the Committee’s view that these contractual notice periods 
continue to be appropriate and in line with current best practice. 
None of the service contracts provide for pre-determined amounts 
of compensation in the event of early termination. On termination of 
service contracts by the Group, in certain circumstances executive 
directors are entitled to the payment of their salary and benefits in 
kind provided that they will be subject to a general duty to mitigate 
their loss. Equity awards on termination are treated in accordance 
with the plan rules. Within contractual constraints, the Committee 
will endeavour to ensure that executive directors do not receive such 
payments if they believe that their performance has had a detrimental 
effect on shareholder value. 
Executive directors are not permitted to accept external directorships 
or other significant appointments without the Chief Executive’s prior 
consent and, in the case of the Chief Executive, the Chairman’s 
consent.  
Part 2 Non-executive directors’ remuneration
2a) Remuneration policy
Non-executive directors are paid directors’ fees, which reflect the 
commitment expected of them, and are reimbursed all necessary and 
reasonable expenses in the performance of their duties. Additional 
fees are paid in respect of attendance at each Remuneration 
Committee, Audit Committee and for one paid meeting of the 
Nominations Committee per annum. Non-executive directors do 
not participate in the Group’s annual bonus, share option, LTRP , 
LTIS, LTIP or pension plans. The non-executive directors have each 
entered into letters of engagement addressing remuneration, services 
to be provided, conflicts of interest and confidentiality. Subject 
to the requirement for retirement by rotation under the Articles of 
Association, the letters of engagement do not have fixed terms and 
are terminable with 90 days written notice.
2b) Annual fee structure
Annual directors’ fee £40,000
Committee attendance fee

£1,000 
With effect from 1st January 2008, non-executive directors can elect 
to be paid in either pounds sterling or in US dollars at the applicable 
exchange rate at the time of payment. There are no changes to the 
structure or level of non-executive directors’ fees for 2009.

Part 3 Additional statutory and other disclosures
3a) The Remuneration Committee
The Committee advises the Board on executive remuneration and sets 
the remuneration packages of each of the executive directors. The 
Committee has a written charter and is comprised solely of independent 
non-executive directors. During the year, the members were JC Morgan 
(Chairman), R Monti, DJ Ogren and NH Smith. The Committee charter is 
publicly available on the Group’s website.
At the invitation of the Chairman of the Committee, Sir Ian Wood 
and AG Langlands attended meetings in 2008, except when their 
own remuneration was being discussed, to provide advice on setting 
remuneration for other executive directors. In addition, the Group’s Head 
of Human Resources provided advice to the Committee.
3b) TSR performance graph
As the Company is listed in the UK FTSE 250 index, by way of providing 
a reasonable Total Shareholder Return “TSR” comparison, the graph 
below compares the Total Shareholder Return on a holding of shares in 
John Wood Group PLC with the Total Shareholder Return on a holding 
of shares in the companies in the UK FTSE 250 index for the last five 
financial years.

3c) Long Term incentives 
All shares and options issued under the following long term incentives 
operate, in aggregate, within the Association of British Insurers “ABI” 
dilution limits in terms of the issue of new shares.
(i) Long Term Incentive Scheme “LTIS”
The Committee introduced the LTIS for executive directors (excluding 
the Chairman) and around 35 key senior executives in 2005. 
Participation in the LTIS was limited to executive directors and those 
other key senior executives who, in the opinion of the Committee, were 
able to materially influence the achievement of the Group’s long term 
business goals. The LTIS and the proposed parameters of its operation 
were approved by shareholders at the 2005 AGM.
Performance was measured in relation to a performance cycle of three 
financial years commencing on 1 January 2005 and ending on 31 
December 2007.  Interim share awards were made after the end of the 
first and second financial years and a final award was made in March 
2008.
Share awards were in the form of restricted shares and are deferred 
for two years after the award date. They are subject to forfeiture if 
participants cease to be employed in the Group (except in certain 
specified circumstances) within the deferral period. During that time 
participants may not exercise any voting rights and cannot sell or 
transfer any restricted shares awarded to them. However, participants 
receive dividends paid to ordinary shareholders after the award date. 
(ii) Long Term Incentive Plan “LTIP”
The John Wood Group PLC Long Term Incentive Plan 2008 “the 
LTIP scheme” was approved by the shareholders at the 2007 AGM 
and is based on three year rolling performance cycles, with the first 
cycle beginning on 1 January 2008 “2008 cycle”. The second cycle 
commenced on 1 January 2009 “2009 cycle”, and it is anticipated that 
a new performance cycle will begin on each succeeding 1 January until 
2012.
Participation in the LTIP scheme is limited to executive directors and 
those other key senior executives who, in the opinion of the Committee, 
are able to materially influence the achievement of the Group’s long term 
business goals. Initially, the Group executive directors and around 35 
key senior executives were invited to participate. 
It is intended that awards will be a combination of shares and restricted 
shares. The inclusion of a provision that 20% of any award earned 
over the performance cycle must be deferred for a further two years, 
in forfeitable restricted shares, is intended to provide encouragement 
for key executive talent to remain with the Group in the long term. The 
2008 cycle for executive directors is based at a maximum of 125% of 
base salary, and the market value of a Wood Group ordinary share at 
the beginning of the performance cycle. From the second performance 
cycle the Committee has the discretion to increase the maximum level 
of an award, if this is deemed necessary to maintain a competitive 
remuneration package, up to a level of 150% of base salary. 
The LTIP scheme contains separate performance measures for 
executive directors and key senior executives. The performance 
measures have been chosen in light of their appropriateness to the 
strategic objectives of the Group, and targets will be set against these 
measures at the commencement of each performance cycle. During the 
course of a performance cycle, the Committee will have the discretion 
to adjust the achievement levels, but only so that the new levels are 
considered as demanding as those first set.
The measurement criteria for executive directors are as follows – 
Total Shareholder Return “TSR” – 25% of performance incentive
The TSR of the Group for the 2008 and 2009 cycles is compared to 
a peer group comprising of Aker Kvaerner, AMEC, Baker Hughes, 
Cameron International, Fluor, FMC, Foster Wheeler, Halliburton, Jacobs 
Engineering, KBR, National Oilwell Varco, Petrofac, Saipem, SBM 
Offshore, Schlumberger, Sulzer, Technip, Weatherford International, The 
Weir Group and Worley Parsons. The Committee has the discretion to 
choose and amend the peer group and during 2008 two companies 
previously included were removed from the peer group following their 
delisting. In the 2008 and 2009 cycles no awards will be made for less 
than the ‘threshold’ performance, or 50th percentile. On reaching the 
‘threshold’, one third of the TSR related element will become payable 
and on reaching the ‘maximum’ performance, or 75th percentile, 100% 
of the TSR element will become payable. For achievement level between 
‘threshold’ and ‘maximum’ performance the allocation will be on a 
straight line basis.

Adjusted Diluted Earnings per Share “AEPS” – 75% of performance 
incentive
Directors will be measured on the absolute increase in AEPS year 
on year, taking into account inflation. The targets for the 2008-
2010 cycle were set at RPI plus 5% at the ‘threshold’, when one 
third of the AEPS element will become payable, and RPI plus 15% 
at the ‘maximum’, when 100% of the AEPS element will become 
payable.  For achievement levels between ‘threshold’ and ‘maximum’ 
performance the allocation will be on a straight line basis. The global 
economic recession and very significant movement in the oil price are 
clearly exceptional circumstances and the Committee may consider 
it appropriate to relook at the targets during 2009, subject always 
to the reward levels being reduced and any revised targets being as 
demanding in the changed circumstances as the targets originally set.
In view of the high current level of uncertainty in the market, the 
Committee has decided to delay setting the performance targets for 
the 2009-2011 cycle until later in 2009.
No awards will be made under the scheme unless the Committee is 
satisfied that the underlying competitive performance of the company 
justifies this.
The performance measures for other key executives are based 
on specific measures for the areas of business for which they are 
responsible.
 
(iii) Long Term Retention Plan “LTRP”
The John Wood Group PLC (No 1) 2003 Long Term Retention Plan, 
the John Wood Group PLC (No 2) 2003 Long Term Retention Plan 
“the LTRP schemes” and the proposed parameters of their operation 
were approved by shareholders at the 2003 AGM. There are currently 
around 350 participants, including executive directors, across the 
Group.
An LTRP award of 100,000 options was made to M H Papworth in 
2008 as part of a pre-employment contractual commitment. An LTRP 
award of 50,000 options was made to M Straughen in 2008 as he 
was ineligible to participate in the LTIS scheme.  Details of options 
issued under the LTRP are included in the table at 3d) below. 
The basis of the LTRP schemes is that an overall bonus pool is 
calculated annually based on growth in the Group’s AEPS in the prior 
year. Under the market conditions pertaining up to the end of 2008, 
there is no bonus pool if the prior year AEPS growth was under the 
threshold of RPI plus 3%, with the maximum bonus pool paid, at an 
equivalent value to 5% of EBTA (earnings before tax, amortisation 
and non-recurring items) if the AEPS meets or exceeds RPI plus 10% 
in the prior year. The Committee are currently considering reviewing 
this for the 2009 year, in light of the changed market circumstances. 
In setting limits the Committee is of the view that they should be 
challenging but achievable.
To increase the retention value and to align with shareholder interests 
the annual awards from this notional bonus pool will be made wholly 
in shares under the LTRP Schemes, which vest four years after award 
and will lapse under certain circumstances.
The level of share awards from the notional bonus pool to an individual 
will be calculated based on the market value of the shares at the time 
of grant. The method of granting these share awards will be by way 
of par value options, which will be exercisable between the fourth and 
fifth anniversary of grant. In the absence of exceptional circumstances, 
the LTRP Scheme rules set one times annual salary as a maximum 
individual award from the notional bonus pool, although it is the 
Committee’s intention that individual awards would not normally be 
more than 50% of annual salary.
(iv) Executive share option schemes
The Group adopted the John Wood Group PLC (No 1) 2002 Executive 
Share Option Scheme and the John Wood Group PLC (No 2) 2002 
Executive Share Option Scheme (the “Share Option Schemes”) after 
approval by the shareholders on the listing of the Group in June 2002.
Options granted under the Share Option Schemes are exercisable 
between four and ten years from the grant date and options granted 
to executive directors are subject to the achievement of performance 
criteria.
The current performance criteria for executive directors in the Share 
Option Schemes is that annualised earnings per share growth over the 
measurement period must be an average of 3% per annum greater 
than the percentage increase, if any, in the RPI, over that period. The 
measurement period is a period of four consecutive financial years, 
starting from the financial year commencing immediately before the 
date of grant.
The operation of the Share Option Schemes is subject to ongoing 
review by the Committee with regard to eligibility, level of allocation 
and frequency of issue, taking into account the practice of comparable 
companies. There are currently around 550 participants across the 
Group.
No grants have been made to executive directors under the Share 
Option Schemes since May 2005. 56 John Wood Group PLC Annual Report 2008

Independent auditors’ report
to the members of the John Wood Group PLC
We have audited the group financial statements of John Wood Group PLC for the year ended 31 December 2008 which comprise the Consolidated 
Income Statement, the Consolidated Balance Sheet, the Consolidated Cash Flow Statement, the Consolidated Statement of Recognised Income 
and Expense and the related notes. These group financial statements have been prepared under the accounting policies set out therein.
We have reported separately on the parent company financial statements of John Wood Group PLC for the year ended 31 December 2008 and on 
the information in the Directors’ Remuneration Report that is described as having been audited.
Respective responsibilities of directors and auditors
The directors’ responsibilities for preparing the Annual Report and the group financial statements in accordance with applicable law and International 
Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the European Union are set out in the Statement of Directors’ Responsibilities.
Our responsibility is to audit the group financial statements in accordance with relevant legal and regulatory requirements and International Standards 
on Auditing (UK and Ireland). This report, including the opinion, has been prepared for and only for the company’s members as a body in accordance 
with Section 235 of the Companies Act 1985 and for no other purpose.  We do not, in giving this opinion, accept or assume responsibility for any 
other purpose or to any other person to whom this report is shown or into whose hands it may come save where expressly agreed by our prior 
consent in writing.
We report to you our opinion as to whether the group financial statements give a true and fair view and whether the group financial statements 
have been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 1985 and Article 4 of the IAS Regulation. We also report to you whether in our 
opinion the information given in the Report of the Directors is consistent with the group financial statements. The information given in the Report of 
the Directors includes that specific information presented in the Operational and Financial Reviews that is cross referred from the Principal Activities 
and Business Review section of the Report of the Directors.
In addition we report to you if, in our opinion, we have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit, or if information 
specified by law regarding directors’ remuneration and other transactions is not disclosed.
We review whether the Corporate Governance Statement reflects the group’s compliance with the nine provisions of the Combined Code (2006) 
specified for our review by the Listing Rules of the Financial Services Authority, and we report if it does not. We are not required to consider whether 
the board’s statements on internal control cover all risks and controls, or form an opinion on the effectiveness of the group’s corporate governance 
procedures or its risk and control procedures.
We read other information contained in the Annual Report and consider whether it is consistent with the audited group financial statements. 
The other information comprises the Report of the Directors, the Chairman’s Statement, the Operational and Financial Reviews, the Corporate 
Governance Statement and all other information listed on the contents page. We consider the implications for our report if we become aware of any 
apparent misstatements or material inconsistencies with the group financial statements. Our responsibilities do not extend to any other information.
Basis of audit opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland) issued by the Auditing Practices Board. An audit 
includes examination, on a test basis, of evidence relevant to the amounts and disclosures in the group financial statements. It also includes an 
assessment of the significant estimates and judgments made by the directors in the preparation of the group financial statements, and of whether 
the accounting policies are appropriate to the group’s circumstances, consistently applied and adequately disclosed.
We planned and performed our audit so as to obtain all the information and explanations which we considered necessary in order to provide us with 
sufficient evidence to give reasonable assurance that the group financial statements are free from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud 
or other irregularity or error. In forming our opinion we also evaluated the overall adequacy of the presentation of information in the group financial 
statements. 59

Notes to the financial statements
for the year to 31 December 2008
Accounting Policies
Basis of preparation 
These financial statements have been prepared in accordance with IFRS and IFRIC interpretations adopted by the European Union (‘EU’) and with 
those parts of the Companies Act 1985 applicable to companies reporting under IFRS. The Group financial statements have been prepared on a 
going concern basis under the historical cost convention as modified by the revaluation of financial assets and liabilities held for trading. 
Significant accounting policies 
The Group’s significant accounting policies adopted in the preparation of these financial statements are set out below. These policies have been 
consistently applied to all the years presented, unless otherwise stated.
Basis of consolidation
The Group financial statements are the result of the consolidation of the financial statements of the Group’s subsidiary undertakings from the date of 
acquisition or up until the date of disposal as appropriate. Subsidiaries are entities over which the Group has the power to govern the financial and 
operating policies and generally accompanies a shareholding of more than one half of the voting rights. The Group’s interests in joint ventures are 
accounted for using proportional consolidation. Under this method the Group includes its share of each joint venture’s income, expenses, assets, 
liabilities and cash flows on a line by line basis in the consolidated financial statements. Transactions between the Group and its joint ventures are 
eliminated to the extent of the Group’s interest in the joint venture. All Group companies apply the Group’s accounting policies and prepare financial 
statements to 31 December.
Critical accounting judgments and estimates
The preparation of the financial statements requires the use of estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities 
at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the year. Although these estimates are based 
on management’s best knowledge of the amount, event or actions, actual results ultimately may differ from those estimates. Where significant 
estimates or assumptions have been applied in estimating balances in the financial statements, these have been disclosed in the relevant notes to 
those balances. Significant judgments and estimates in these financial statements have been made with regard to goodwill impairment testing (note 
9), trade receivables (note 13), provisions (note 19), deferred tax balances (note 20), share based charges (note 21) and retirement benefit liabilities 
(note 30). An explanation of key uncertainties or assumptions used by management in accounting for these items is explained where material in the 
respective notes.
Functional currency
The Group’s earnings stream is primarily US dollars and the principal functional currency is the US dollar, being the most representative currency of 
the Group. The Group’s financial statements are therefore prepared in US dollars.
The following exchange rates have been used in the preparation of these accounts:
2008 2007
Average rate £1 = $ 1.8484 1.9995
Closing rate £1 = $ 1.4378 1.9906
Foreign currencies
Income statements of entities whose functional currency is not the US dollar are translated into US dollars at average rates of exchange for the 
period and assets and liabilities are translated into US dollars at the rates of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date. Exchange differences arising 
on translation of net assets in such entities held at the beginning of the year, together with those differences resulting from the restatement of profits 
and losses from average to year end rates, are taken to the currency translation reserve. 
In each individual entity, transactions in overseas currencies are translated into the relevant functional currency at the exchange rates ruling at the 
date of the transaction. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at the exchange rates ruling at the balance 
sheet date. Any exchange differences are taken to the income statement.
Goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on the acquisition of a foreign entity are treated as assets and liabilities of the foreign entity and translated 
at the exchange rate ruling at the balance sheet date.
The directors consider it appropriate to record sterling denominated equity share capital in the accounts of John Wood Group PLC at the exchange 
rate ruling on the date it was raised. 65

Notes to the financial statements
for the year to 31 December 2008
Revenue recognition
Revenue is measured at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable. Revenue is recognised only when it is probable that the 
economic benefits associated with a transaction will flow to the Group and the amount of revenue can be measured reliably. Revenue from 
services is recognised as the services are rendered, including where they are based on contractual rates per man hour in respect of multi-
year service contracts. Incentive performance revenue is recognised upon completion of agreed objectives. Revenue from product sales is 
recognised when the significant risks and rewards of ownership have been transferred to the buyer, which is normally upon delivery of products 
and customer acceptance, if any. Where revenue relates to a multi-element contract, then each element of the contract is accounted for 
separately. Revenue is stated net of sales taxes and discounts. 
Revenue on lump-sum contracts for services, construction contracts and fixed price long term service agreements is recognised according to 
the stage of completion reached in the contract by reference to the value of work done. An estimate of the profit attributable to work completed 
is recognised once the outcome of the contract can be estimated reliably. Expected losses are recognised in full as soon as losses are probable. 
The net amount of costs incurred to date plus recognised profits less the sum of recognised losses and progress billings is disclosed as trade 
receivables/trade payables.
Goodwill 
The Group uses the purchase method of accounting to account for acquisitions. Goodwill represents the excess of the cost of an acquisition 
over the fair value of the net assets acquired. Goodwill is carried at cost less accumulated impairment losses. 
Other intangible assets
Intangible assets are carried at cost less accumulated amortisation. Intangible assets are recognised if it is probable that there will be future 
economic benefits attributable to the asset, the cost of the asset can be measured reliably, the asset is separately identifiable and there is control 
over the use of the asset. Where the Group acquires a business, other intangible assets such as customer contracts are identified and evaluated 
to determine the carrying value on the acquisition balance sheet. Intangible assets are amortised over their estimated useful lives, as follows:
 Computer software 3 – 5 years
 Other intangible assets 1 – 10 years
Property plant and equipment
Property plant and equipment (PP&E) is stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment. No depreciation is charged with respect 
to freehold land and assets in the course of construction. Transfers from PP&E to current assets are undertaken at the lower of cost and net 
realisable value.
Depreciation is calculated using the straight line method over the following estimated useful lives of the assets:
 Freehold and long leasehold buildings 25 – 50 years 
 Short leasehold buildings period of lease 
 Plant and equipment 3 – 10 years
When estimating the useful life of an asset group, the principal factors the Group takes into account are the durability of the assets, the intensity 
at which the assets are expected to be used and the expected rate of technological developments.
Impairment
The Group performs impairment reviews in respect of PP&E and other intangible assets whenever events or changes in circumstance indicate 
that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. In addition, the Group carries out annual impairment reviews in respect of goodwill. An 
impairment loss is recognised when the recoverable amount of an asset, which is the higher of the asset’s fair value less costs to sell and its 
value in use, is less than its carrying amount. 
For the purposes of impairment testing, goodwill is allocated to the appropriate cash generating unit (“CGU”). The CGUs are aligned to the 
structure the Group uses to manage its business. Cash flows are discounted in determining the value in use. 66 John Wood Group PLC Annual Report 2008
Energy Supporting Energy
Notes to the financial statements
for the year to 31 December 2008
Accounting Policies
Inventories
Inventories, which include materials, work in progress and finished goods and goods for resale, are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable 
value. Product based companies determine cost by weighted average cost methods using standard costing to gather material, labour and overhead 
costs. These costs are adjusted, where appropriate, to correlate closely the standard costs to the actual costs incurred based on variance analysis. 
Service based companies’ inventories consist of spare parts and other consumables. Serialised parts are costed using the specific identification 
method and other materials are generally costed using the first in, first out method.
Net realisable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business, less the estimated costs of completion and estimated selling 
expenses. Allowance is made for obsolete and slow-moving items, based upon annual usage.
Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents include cash in hand and other short-term bank deposits with maturities of three months or less and bank overdrafts 
where there is a right of set-off. Bank overdrafts are included within borrowings in current liabilities where there is no right of set-off.
Trade receivables
Trade receivables are recognised initially at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method, less provision 
for impairment. A provision for impairment of trade receivables is established when there is objective evidence that the Group will not be able to 
collect all amounts due according to the original terms of the receivables. The amount of the provision is the difference between the asset’s carrying 
amount and the present value of estimated future cash flows, discounted at the effective interest rate. The provision is determined by reference to 
previous experience of recoverability for receivables in each market in which the Group operates. 
Trade payables
Trade payables are recognised initially at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost.
Borrowings
Borrowings are recognised initially at fair value, net of transaction costs incurred. Borrowings are subsequently stated at amortised cost.
Deferred consideration
Where it is probable that deferred consideration is payable on the acquisition of a business based on an earn out arrangement, an estimate of the 
amount payable is made at the date of acquisition and reviewed regularly thereafter, with any change in the estimated liability being reflected in 
goodwill. Where deferred consideration is payable after more than one year the estimated liability is discounted using an appropriate rate of interest.
Taxation
The tax charge represents the sum of tax currently payable and deferred tax. Tax currently payable is based on the taxable profit for the year. Taxable 
profit differs from the profit reported in the income statement due to items that are not taxable or deductible in any period and also due to items that 
are taxable or deductible in a different period. The Group’s liability for current tax is calculated using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the 
balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is provided, using the full liability method, on temporary differences arising between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their 
carrying amounts in the consolidated financial statements. The principal temporary differences arise from depreciation on PP&E, tax losses carried 
forward and, in relation to acquisitions, the difference between the fair values of the net assets acquired and their tax base. Tax rates enacted, or 
substantially enacted, by the balance sheet date are used to determine deferred tax.
Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which the temporary differences 
can be utilised.
Accounting for derivative financial instruments and hedging activities
Derivatives are initially recognised at fair value on the date the contract is entered into and are subsequently remeasured at their fair value. The 
method of recognising the resulting gain or loss depends on whether the derivative is designated as a hedging instrument, and if so, the nature of 
the item being hedged. The Group designates certain derivatives as either: (1) hedges of the fair value of recognised assets or liabilities or a firm 
commitment (fair value hedge); (2) hedges of highly probable forecast transactions (cash flow hedge); or (3) hedges of net investments in foreign 
operations (net investment hedge). 67

Notes to the financial statements
for the year to 31 December 2008
Where hedging is to be undertaken, the Group documents the relationship between the hedging instrument and the hedged item at the 
inception of the transaction, as well as its risk management objective and strategy for undertaking the hedge transaction. The Group also 
documents its assessment, both at hedge inception and on an ongoing basis, of whether the derivatives that are used in hedging transactions 
are highly effective in offsetting changes in fair values or cash flows of the hedged items. The Group performs effectiveness testing on a quarterly 
basis.
(a) Fair value hedge
Changes in the fair value of derivatives that are designated and qualify as fair value hedges are recorded in administrative expenses in 
the income statement, together with any changes in the fair value of the hedged asset or liability that are attributable to the hedged risk.
(b) Cash flow hedge
The effective portion of changes in the fair value of derivatives that are designated and qualify as cash flow hedges is recognised in the 
hedging reserve in equity. The gain or loss relating to the ineffective portion is recognised immediately in administrative expenses in the 
income statement. Amounts accumulated in equity are recycled through the income statement in periods when the hedged item affects 
profit or loss. 
When a hedging instrument expires or is sold, or when a hedge no longer meets the criteria for hedge accounting, any cumulative gain 
or loss existing in equity at that time remains in equity and is recognised when the forecast transaction is ultimately recognised in the 
income statement. When a forecast transaction is no longer expected to occur, the cumulative gain or loss that was reported in equity is 
immediately transferred to the income statement.
(c) Net investment hedge
Hedges of net investments in foreign operations are accounted for similarly to cash flow hedges. Any gain or loss on the hedging 
instrument relating to the effective portion of the hedge is recognised in the currency translation reserve in equity; the gain or loss relating 
to the ineffective portion is recognised immediately in administrative expenses in the income statement. Gains and losses accumulated 
in equity are included in the income statement when the foreign operation is disposed of.
(d) Derivatives that are not designated as hedges
Certain derivatives, whilst providing effective economic hedges are not designated as hedges. Changes in the fair value of any derivative 
instruments that are not designated for hedge accounting are recognised immediately in administrative expenses in the income 
statement.
Fair value estimation
The fair value of interest rate swaps is calculated as the present value of their estimated future cash flows. The fair value of forward foreign 
exchange contracts is determined using forward foreign exchange market rates at the balance sheet date. The carrying values of trade 
receivables and payables approximate to their fair values. The fair value of financial liabilities is estimated by discounting the future contractual 
cash flows at the current market interest rate that is available to the Group for similar financial instruments.
Operating leases
As lessee
Payments made under operating leases are charged to the income statement on a straight line basis over the period of the lease. Benefits 
received and receivable as an incentive to enter into an operating lease are also spread on a straight line basis over the period of lease.
As lessor
Operating lease rental income arising from leased assets is recognised in the income statement on a straight line basis over the period of the 
lease. 68 John Wood Group PLC Annual Report 2008

Accounting Policies
Finance leases
As lessee
Assets held under finance leases are capitalised as PP&E and depreciated over the shorter of the lease term and the asset’s useful life. The capital 
element of the future lease obligation is recorded as a liability, with the interest element charged to the income statement over the period of the lease 
so as to produce a constant rate of charge on the capital outstanding. 
As lessor
Finance lease rental income arising from leased assets is recognised in the income statement so as to produce a constant rate of return on the net 
cash investment. Amounts receivable under finance leases represent the outstanding amounts due under these agreements less amounts allocated 
to future periods.
Retirement benefit liabilities
The Group operates a defined benefit scheme and a number of defined contribution schemes. The liability recognised in respect of the defined 
benefit scheme represents the present value of the defined benefit obligations less the fair value of the scheme assets. The assets of this scheme are 
held in separate trustee administered funds. 
The defined benefit scheme’s assets are measured using market values. Pension scheme liabilities are measured annually by an independent actuary 
using the projected unit method and discounted at the current rate of return on a high quality corporate bond of equivalent term and currency to the 
liability. The increase in the present value of the liabilities of the Group’s defined benefit scheme expected to arise from employee service in the period 
is charged to operating profit. The expected return on the scheme assets and the increase during the period in the present value of the scheme’s 
liabilities arising from the passage of time are included in finance income/expense. Actuarial gains and losses are recognised in the statement of 
recognised income and expense in full in the period in which they occur. The defined benefit scheme’s net assets or net liabilities are recognised in 
full and presented on the face of the balance sheet.
The Group’s contributions to defined contribution schemes are charged to the income statement in the period to which the contributions relate.
Provisions 
Provision is made for the estimated liability on all products and services still under warranty, including claims already received, based on past 
experience. Other provisions are recognised where the Group is deemed to have a legal or constructive obligation, it is probable that a transfer 
of economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation, and a reliable estimate of the obligation can be made. Where amounts provided are 
payable after more than one year the estimated liability is discounted using an appropriate rate of interest.
Share based charges relating to employee share schemes
The Group has a number of employee share schemes:-
(i) Share options granted under Executive Share Option Schemes (‘ESOS’) are granted at market value. A charge is booked to the income 
statement as an employee benefit expense for the fair value of share options expected to be exercised, accrued over the vesting period. 
The corresponding credit is taken to retained earnings. The fair value is calculated using an option pricing model.
(ii) Share options granted under the Long Term Retention Plan (‘LTRP’) are granted at par value. The charge to the income statement for 
LTRP shares is also calculated using an option pricing model and, as with ESOS grants, the fair value of the share options expected to 
be exercised is accrued over the vesting period. The corresponding credit is also taken to retained earnings.
(iii) The Group has a Long Term Incentive Scheme (‘LTIS’) and a Long Term Incentive Plan (‘LTIP’) for directors and key senior executives. 
Participants are awarded shares dependent on the achievement of certain performance targets. The charge to the income statement for 
shares awarded under the LTIS and LTIP is based on the fair value of those shares at the grant date, spread over the vesting period. The 
corresponding credit is taken to retained earnings. For those awards that have a market related performance measure, the fair value of 
the market related element is calculated using a Monte Carlo simulation model.
Proceeds received on the exercise of share options are credited to share capital and share premium. 69

Share capital
John Wood Group PLC has one class of ordinary shares and these are classified as equity. Dividends on ordinary shares are not recognised as a 
liability or charged to equity until they have been approved by shareholders.
The Group is deemed to have control of the assets, liabilities, income and costs of its employee share ownership trusts (‘ESOP trusts’). They 
have therefore been consolidated in the financial statements of the Group. Shares acquired by and disposed of by the ESOP trusts are recorded 
at cost. The cost of shares held by the ESOP trusts is deducted from shareholders’ equity.
Segmental reporting
The Group’s primary reporting segments are its three operating divisions, namely Engineering & Production Facilities, Well Support and Gas 
Turbine Services. The Group measures the operating performance of these segments using ‘EBITDA’ (Earnings before interest, tax, depreciation 
and amortisation) and ‘EBITA’ (Earnings before interest, tax and amortisation).
Engineering & Production Facilities offers a wide range of engineering services to the upstream, midstream, downstream and industrial sectors. 
These include conceptual studies, engineering, project and construction management and control system upgrades. It also offers life of field 
support to producing assets through brownfield engineering and modifications, production enhancement, operations management, maintenance 
management and abandonment services.
Well Support provides solutions, products and services to enhance production rates and efficiency from oil and gas reservoirs.
Gas Turbine Services is an independent provider of integrated maintenance solutions and repair and overhaul services for industrial gas turbines 
used for power generation, compression and transmission in the oil and gas and power generation industries.

6 Taxation (continued)
Tax is calculated at the rates prevailing in the respective jurisdictions in which the Group operates.  The expected rate is the weighted average rate 
taking into account the Group’s profits in these jurisdictions.  The expected rate has decreased in 2008 due to the change in profitability of the 
Group’s subsidiaries in their respective jurisdictions. The tax charge for the year is lower (2007 : lower) than the expected tax charge due to the 
following factors:

The calculation of basic earnings per share for the year ended 31 December 2008 is based on the earnings attributable to equity shareholders 
divided by the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue during the year excluding shares held by the Group’s employee share 
ownership trusts. For the calculation of diluted earnings per share, the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue is adjusted to 
assume conversion of all potentially dilutive ordinary shares. The Group has two types of dilutive ordinary shares – share options granted to 
employees under Executive Share Option Schemes and the Long Term Retention Plan; and shares issuable under the Group’s Long Term 
Incentive Scheme and Long Term Incentive Plan. Adjusted basic and adjusted diluted earnings per share is disclosed to show the results 
excluding the impact of amortisation, impairment and restructuring charges and profit on disposal of interest in joint venture, net of tax. 76 John Wood Group PLC Annual Report 2008

In accordance with IAS 36 ‘Impairment of assets’, goodwill was tested for impairment during the year. The impairment tests were carried out on 
a Cash Generating Unit (‘CGU’) basis using the 2009-10 budgets. Cash flows for 2011-13 are assumed to grow at a rate of 5% per annum and 
subsequent cash flows have been assumed to grow at 3% per annum for a further 15 years. In total, a 20 year period has been used for the 
impairment tests reflecting the expected long term growth in the market. The cash flows have been discounted using a pre-tax discount rate of 10%. 
The value in use has been compared to the net book value of goodwill for each CGU and no impairment write down is required. 77

9 Goodwill and other intangible assets (continued)
A sensitivity analysis has been performed in order to assess the impact of reasonable possible changes in the key assumptions due to the 
current economic environment. This analysis did not identify any impaired CGUs. 
The impairment charge for 2007 is included in the ‘impairment and restructuring charges’ line in the income statement. 
The carrying amounts of goodwill by division are: Engineering & Production Facilities $453.4m (2007 : $392.0m), Gas Turbine Services $78.5m 
(2007 : $88.4m) and Well Support $33.5m (2007 : $33.5m). At 31 December 2008, the carrying amounts of goodwill attributable to the principal 
CGUs within the Engineering & Production Facilities division are Mustang $148.7m, IMV $132.0m, Production Facilities Americas $71.5m and 
Subsea & Pipeline $57.3m.
The other heading in the above table includes development costs, licences and customer contracts and relationships arising on acquisitions. 
Development costs with a net book value of $10.7m (2007 : $11.6m) are internally generated intangible assets.

Receivable days are calculated by allocating the closing trade receivables balance to current and prior period revenue including sales taxes. 
A receivable days calculation of 52 indicates that closing trade receivables represent the most recent 52 days of revenue. A provision for the 
impairment of trade receivables is established when there is objective evidence that the Group will not be able to collect all amounts due according 
to the terms of the original receivables. The change in the economic environment has contributed to the increase in the provision for impairment 
during the year.

during 2009. The financial covenants applicable to the bilateral borrowing facilities are the ratio of net debt to EBITDA, which must not exceed 3.5:1, 
and the interest cover ratio, which must not be less than 3.5:1. The measurement of the Group’s performance against these covenants is provided in 
note 18 under the capital risk heading. In February 2009, the Group renewed its bilateral borrowing facilities for a further 3 years. The bank facilities

18 Financial instruments
The Group’s activities give rise to a variety of financial risks: market risk (including currency risk and cash flow interest rate risk), credit risk and 
liquidity risk. The Group’s overall risk management strategy is to hedge exposures wherever practicable in order to minimise any potential adverse 
impact on the Group’s financial performance.
Risk management is carried out by the Group Treasury department in line with the Group’s Treasury policies. Group Treasury together with the 
Group’s business units identify, evaluate and where appropriate, hedge financial risks. The Group’s Treasury policies cover specific areas, such as 
foreign exchange risk, interest rate risk, use of derivative financial instruments and investment of excess cash.
Where the Board considers that a material element of the Group’s profits and net assets are exposed to a country in which there is significant geo-
political uncertainty a report is prepared for the Board and a strategy agreed to ensure that the risk is minimised. 85

Notes to the financial statements
for the year to 31 December 2008
18 Financial instruments (continued)
(a) Market risk
(i) Foreign exchange risk
The Group is exposed to foreign exchange risk arising from various currencies. The Group also has a number of subsidiary companies whose 
revenue and expenses are denominated in currencies other than the US dollar. In order to protect the Group’s balance sheet from movements 
in exchange rates, wherever practicable, the Group finances its net investment in non US dollar subsidiaries primarily by means of borrowings 
denominated in the appropriate currency. Other strategies, including the payment of dividends, are used to minimise the amount of net assets 
exposed to foreign currency revaluation.
Some of the sales of the Group’s businesses are to customers in overseas locations. Where possible, the Group’s policy is to eliminate all 
significant currency exposures on sales at the time of the transaction by using financial instruments such as forward currency contracts. 
Changes in the forward contract fair values are booked through the income statement.
The Group carefully monitors the economic and political situation in the countries in which it operates to ensure appropriate action is taken to 
minimise any foreign currency exposure.
The Group’s main foreign exchange risk relates to movements in the sterling/US dollar exchange rate. Movements in the sterling/US dollar rate 
impact the translation of sterling profit earned in the UK and the translation of sterling denominated net assets.
If the average sterling/US dollar rate had been 10% higher during 2008, post-tax profit for the year would have been $9.8m higher (2007: $2.4m 
higher). If the average sterling/US dollar rate had been 10% lower during 2008, post-tax profit for the year would have been $7.6m lower (2007: 
$5.4m lower). If the closing sterling/US dollar rate was 10% higher or lower at 31 December 2008, exchange differences in equity would have 
been $11.5m (2007: $10.9m) higher or lower respectively.
(ii) Interest rate risk
The Group finances its operations through a mixture of retained profits and bank borrowings. The Group borrows in the desired currencies at 
floating rates of interest and then uses interest rate swaps into fixed rates to generate the desired interest profile and to manage the Group’s 
exposure to interest rate fluctuations. The Group’s long-term policy is to maintain approximately 50% of its borrowings at fixed rates of interest. 
At 31 December 2008, 39% (2007 : 44%) of the Group’s borrowings were at fixed rates after taking account of interest rate swaps.
The Group is also exposed to interest rate risk on cash held on deposit. The Group’s policy is to maximise the return on cash deposits whilst 
ensuring that cash is deposited with a financial institution with a credit rating of ‘AA’ or better, where possible. If average interest rates had been 
1% higher or lower during 2008, post-tax profit for the year would have been $2.0m higher or lower respectively (2007: $1.5m). 
(iii) Price risk
The Group is not exposed to any significant price risk in relation to its financial instruments. 86 John Wood Group PLC Annual Report 2008
Energy Supporting Energy
Notes to the financial statements
for the year to 31 December 2008
18 Financial instruments (continued)
(b) Credit risk
The Group’s credit risk primarily relates to its trade receivables. The Group’s operations comprise three divisions, Engineering & Production Facilities, 
Well Support and Gas Turbine Services each made up of a number of businesses. Responsibility for managing credit risks lies within the businesses 
with support being provided by Group and divisional management where appropriate.
A customer evaluation is typically obtained from an appropriate credit rating agency. Where required, appropriate trade finance instruments such as 
letters of credit, bonds, guarantees and credit insurance will be used to manage credit risk. 
The Group’s major customers are typically large companies which have strong credit ratings assigned by international credit rating agencies. Where 
a customer does not have sufficiently strong credit ratings, alternative forms of security such as the trade finance instruments referred to above 
may be obtained. The Group has a broad customer base and management believe that no further credit risk provision is required in excess of 
the provision for impairment of trade receivables. The Group has increased its focus on credit risk and credit management in light of the current 
economic environment and appropriate measures have been implemented to reduce the risk profile where possible. The change in the economic 
environment has contributed to the increase in the provision for impaired receivables as disclosed in note 13.
Management review trade receivables across the Group based on receivable days calculations to assess performance. There is significant 
management focus on receivables that are overdue. A table showing trade receivables and receivable days by division is provided in note 13. 
Receivable days calculations are not provided on non-trade receivables as management do not believe that this information is relevant. 
The Group also has credit risk in relation to cash held on deposit. The Group’s policy is to deposit cash at institutions with a ‘AA’ rating or better 
where possible. 41% of cash held on deposit at 31 December 2008 (2007 : 100%) was held with such institutions, the reduced percentage being 
due, in part, to the downgrading in ratings of certain institutions.
(c) Liquidity risk
With regard to liquidity, the Group’s policy is to ensure continuity of funding. At 31 December 2008, 97% (2007 : 93%) of the Group’s borrowing 
facilities (excluding joint ventures) were due to mature in more than one year. In February 2009, the Group renewed its bilateral borrowing facilities for 
a further 3 years. Based on the current outlook the Group has sufficient funding in place to meet its future obligations.
(d) Capital risk
The Group seeks to maintain an optimal capital structure. The Group monitors its capital structure on the basis of its gearing ratio, interest cover and 
the ratio of net debt to EBITDA.
Gearing is calculated by dividing net debt by shareholders’ funds. Gearing at 31 December 2008 was 22% (2007: 29%).
Interest cover is calculated by dividing EBITA by net interest expense. Interest cover for the year to 31 December 2008 was 13.9 times (2007: 12.6 
times).
The ratio of net debt to EBITDA at 31 December 2008 was 0.5 (2007: 0.7). 87

The fair value of short-term borrowings, trade and other payables, trade and other receivables, short-term deposits and cash at bank and in hand 
approximates to the carrying amount because of the short maturity of interest rates in respect of these instruments. Long-term borrowings are 
generally rolled over for periods of three months or less and as a result, book value and fair value are considered to be the same.

the remaining maturity of the hedged item is more than 12 months and, as a current asset or liability if the maturity of the hedged item is less than 12 
months. 
There was no ineffectiveness recorded in the income statement from fair value hedges in the current or preceding period. There was no 
ineffectiveness recorded in the income statement from cash flow hedges in the current or preceding period. There was no ineffectiveness recorded in

18 Financial instruments (continued)
The maximum exposure to credit risk at the reporting date is the fair value of the derivative assets in the balance sheet.
(a) Forward foreign exchange contracts
  The notional principal amounts of the outstanding forward foreign exchange contracts at 31 December 2008 was $120.5m (2007: 
$163.7m).
(b) Interest rate swaps
  The notional principal amount of the Group’s outstanding interest rate swap contracts at 31 December 2008 was $166.5m (2007 : 
$175.0m).
  At 31 December 2008 the fixed interest rates excluding margin varied from 4.3% to 5.2% (2007 : 2.7% to 5.2%) and the floating 
rate was 2.9% also excluding margin (2007 : 5.3%). The Group interest rate swaps are for periods of up to 5 years and they expire 
between 2009 and 2013.  The bank has a break option on one $25m 5 year swap. This option is exercisable on a quarterly basis. 
  The fair value gains and losses relating to the interest rate swaps which are deferred in equity at 31 December 2008 will reverse in the 
income statement over the term of the swaps.
(c) Hedge of net investment in foreign entities
  The table below shows the Group’s foreign currency borrowings which it has designated as a hedge of subsidiary company net 
assets. The fair value of the borrowings at 31 December 2008 was $206.1m (2007 : $158.4m). Foreign exchange gains of $46.8m 
(2007 : losses $7.6m) on translation of the borrowings into US dollars have been recognised in the currency translation reserve.

Warranty provisions
These provisions are recognised in respect of guarantees provided in the normal course of business relating to contract performance.  They are 
based on previous claims history and it is expected that most of these costs will be incurred over the next two years. 
Other provisions
At 31 December 2008, other provisions of $26.3m (2007 : $19.0m) have been recognised. This amount includes provisions for future losses on 
onerous contracts, a provision for non-recoverable indirect taxes and a provision for remedial work at one of our facilities.  It is expected that the 
majority of the costs in relation to these provisions will be incurred over the next two years. 
20 Deferred tax 
Deferred tax is calculated in full on temporary differences under the liability method using the tax rate applicable to the territory in which the asset or 
liability has arisen.  Deferred tax in relation to UK companies is provided at 28% (2007: 28%).

No deferred tax is recognised on the unremitted earnings of overseas subsidiaries and joint ventures. As these earnings are continually reinvested by 
the Group, no tax is expected to be payable on them in the foreseeable future. If the earnings were remitted, tax of $22.1m (2007 : $20.0m) would 
be payable. 91

21 Share based charges 
The Group currently has four share schemes that give rise to share based charges. These are the Executive Share Option Scheme (‘ESOS’), the 
Long Term Retention Plan (‘LTRP’), the Long Term Incentive Scheme (‘LTIS’) and the Long Term Incentive Plan (‘LTIP’). The LTIP replaced the 
LTIS on 1 January 2008. Details of each of the schemes are given in the Directors’ Remuneration Report and in note 22.
The charge in the Group income statement in 2008 for these schemes amounted to $13.3m (2007 : $13.7m)
The assumptions made in arriving at the charge for each scheme are detailed below:
ESOS and LTRP
At 31 December 2008 there were 750 employees (2007 : 618) participating in these schemes. For the purposes of calculating the fair value of 
the share options, a Black-Scholes option pricing model has been used. Based on past experience, it has been assumed that options will be 
exercised, on average, six months after the earliest exercise date, which is four years after grant date, and there will be a lapse rate of between 
15% and 20%. The share price volatility used in the calculation of 35%-40% is based on the actual volatility of the Group’s shares since IPO as 
well as that of comparable companies. The risk free rate of return of 4.0%-5.2% is based on the implied yield available on zero coupon gilts with 
a term remaining equal to the expected lifetime of the options at the date of grant. A dividend yield of approximately 1.0% has been used in the 
calculations. 
The fair value of options granted under the ESOS during the year ranged from £1.17 to £1.23 (2007 : £0.91). The fair value of options granted 
under the LTRP during the year ranged from £3.36 to £3.62 (2007 : £2.54 to £3.92). The weighted average remaining contractual life of share 
options at 31 December 2008 is 5.3 years (2007: 5.7 years).
LTIS/LTIP
The share based charge for the LTIS was calculated using a fair value of £1.40. The charge for the LTIP was calculated using a fair value of 
£4.12. The charge for market related performance targets has been calculated using a Monte Carlo simulation model using similar assumptions 
to the ESOS and LTRP calculations.  92 John Wood Group PLC Annual Report 2008

1
⁄3 pence per share). There are no performance criteria attached to the exercise of 
options under the LTRP , however no LTRP options are granted unless the Group achieves a minimum level of EPS growth of RPI plus 3%. The 
level of grant varies between RPI plus 3% and RPI plus 10%. 1,806,944 LTRP options were granted during the year, 442,615 LTRP options 
were exercised during the year and 114,491 LTRP options lapsed during the year. The weighted average share price for LTRP options exercised 
during the year was £4.22 (2007 : £3.59). Further details on the LTRP are provided in the Directors’ Remuneration Report. 
Long Term Incentive Scheme/Long Term Incentive Plan
The Group’s Long Term Incentive Scheme (‘LTIS’) which had been in place since 2005 was replaced by the Long Term Incentive Plan (‘LTIP’) 
in 2008. Under these Schemes, the executive directors (but not the Chairman) and other key senior executives are awarded shares dependent 
upon the achievement of performance targets established by the Remuneration Committee. The performance measures for the LTIP are EBITA, 
return on capital employed, total shareholder return and adjusted earnings per share. The total shareholder return and adjusted earnings per 
share performance measures apply to the executive directors only. The LTIP awards are in the form of shares and restricted shares. 20% of 
any award earned over the three year performance cycle are deferred for a further two years in the form of forfeitable restricted shares. At 31 
December 2008, 7,035,534 shares were potentially issuable under these schemes. Further details of the LTIS and LTIP are provided in the 
Directors’ Remuneration Report.

of the investment in own shares from sterling to US dollars. The costs of funding and administering the trusts are charged to the income statement 
in the period to which they relate. The market value of the shares at 31 December 2008 was $59.2m (2007 : $168.2m) based on the closing share 
price of £1.88 (2007 : £4.33). The ESOP trusts have waived their rights to receipt of dividends except in relation to those shares used to meet 
obligations under the LTIS. 95

Goodwill 88.4
Consideration 126.9
Consideration satisfied by:
Cash 91.8
Deferred consideration 35.1
126.9
The Group has used acquisition accounting for the purchases and, in accordance with the Group’s accounting policies, the goodwill arising 
on consolidation of $88.4m has been capitalised. The amounts disclosed in the table above relate to the acquisitions of Producers Assistance 
Corporation (‘PAC’), Netlink Inspection Pty (‘Netlink’), Marine & Offshore Group (‘M&O’) and Marine Computation Services Group (‘MCS’), which 
were acquired during the year. The fair values in the above table are equivalent to the book values with the exception of goodwill and other 
intangible assets. The acquisitions are not considered to be material to the Group on an individual basis and therefore have been aggregated in 
the table above.
PAC, acquired in January 2008, provides technical operations and maintenance support services to the US onshore oil and gas industry. Netlink, 
acquired in May 2008, provides customised software products and services relating to asset integrity management. M&O, acquired in August 
2008, provides safety and emergency response training services to the international offshore, maritime and mining industries. MCS, acquired in 
September 2008, is a global subsea engineering consultancy and provides riser and mooring design services and advanced engineering and 
software solutions to the subsea industry. The Group acquired 100% of the share capital of all four companies acquired during the year.
The acquisitions during the year provide the Group with access to new markets and strengthen the Group’s capabilities in certain areas. The 
acquired companies will be in a position to access the Group’s wider client base and use the Group’s existing relationships to further grow and 
develop their businesses. These factors contribute to the goodwill recognised by the Group on the acquisitions. 
Deferred consideration payments of $26.8m were made during the year in respect of acquisitions made in prior periods. Payments during the 
year and changes to previous estimates of deferred consideration have resulted in additional goodwill of $21.6m. Costs of $1.4m were incurred 
during the year in respect of acquisitions made in 2007. 98 John Wood Group PLC Annual Report 2008

28 Acquisitions and disposals (continued)
During 2008, the Group disposed of an Engineering & Production Facilities business in Europe, a small Gas Turbine Services business in North 
America and partly disposed of a Well Support business in South America. 
In January 2009, the Group disposed of two small businesses in its Gas Turbine Services division. The assets and liabilities relating to these

30 Retirement benefit liabilities
One of the Group’s pension schemes in the UK, the John Wood Group PLC Retirement Benefits Scheme, is a defined benefit scheme, which is 
contracted out of the State Scheme. The assets of the scheme are held separately from those of the Group, being invested with independent 
investment companies in trustee administered funds.
The most recent actuarial valuation of the scheme was carried out at 5 April 2007 by a professionally qualified actuary. On 5 April 2007 there was a 
change to the benefits provided under the scheme. From that date benefits are calculated on a Career Averaged Revalued Earnings (“CARE”) basis. 
The principal assumptions made by the actuaries at the balance sheet date were:
2008 2007
% %
Rate of increase in pensionable salaries 4.90 5.40
Rate of increase in pensions in payment and deferred pensions 2.90 3.40
Discount rate 6.20 5.60
Expected return on scheme assets 7.06 7.00
The expected return on scheme assets is based on market expectation at the beginning of the period for returns over the entire life of the benefit 
obligation.
The mortality assumptions used by the actuary take account of standard actuarial tables compiled from UK wide statistics relating to occupational 
pension schemes. At 31 December 2008 the actuary has used the PXA92 (YOB) with medium cohort improvements and a further improvements 
reserve of 3% of liabilities.
The amounts recognised in the balance sheet are determined as follows:
2008 2007
$m $m
Present value of funded obligations (124.7) (187.5)
Fair value of scheme assets 101.6 176.2
Net liabilities (23.1) (11.3)

Independent auditors’ report
to the members of the John Wood Group PLC
We have audited the parent company financial statements of John Wood Group PLC for the year ended 31 December 2008 which comprise the 
Balance Sheet and the related notes. These parent company financial statements have been prepared under the accounting policies set out therein. 
We have also audited the information in the Directors’ Remuneration Report that is described as having been audited.
We have reported separately on the group financial statements of John Wood Group PLC for the year ended 31 December 2008.
Respective responsibilities of directors and auditors
The directors’ responsibilities for preparing the Annual Report, the Directors’ Remuneration Report and the parent company financial statements in 
accordance with applicable law and United Kingdom Accounting Standards (United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice) are set out in 
the Statement of Directors’ Responsibilities.
Our responsibility is to audit the parent company financial statements and the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited in 
accordance with relevant legal and regulatory requirements and International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland). This report, including the 
opinion, has been prepared for and only for the company’s members as a body in accordance with Section 235 of the Companies Act 1985 and 
for no other purpose. We do not, in giving this opinion, accept or assume responsibility for any other purpose or to any other person to whom this 
report is shown or into whose hands it may come save where expressly agreed by our prior consent in writing.
We report to you our opinion as to whether the parent company financial statements give a true and fair view and whether the parent company 
financial statements and the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited have been properly prepared in accordance with the 
Companies Act 1985. We also report to you whether in our opinion the information given in the Report of the Directors is consistent with the parent 
company financial statements. The information given in the Report of the Directors includes that specific information presented in the Operational 
and Financial Reviews that is cross referred from the Principal Activities and Business Review section of the Report of the Directors. 
In addition we report to you if, in our opinion, the company has not kept proper accounting records, if we have not received all the information and 
explanations we require for our audit, or if information specified by law regarding directors’ remuneration and other transactions is not disclosed.
We read other information contained in the Annual Report and consider whether it is consistent with the audited parent company financial 
statements. The other information comprises the Report of the Directors, the unaudited part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report, the Chairman’s 
Statement and the Operational and Financial Reviews and all other information listed on the contents page. We consider the implications for 
our report if we become aware of any apparent misstatements or material inconsistencies with the parent company financial statements. Our 
responsibilities do not extend to any other information.
Basis of audit opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland) issued by the Auditing Practices Board. An audit 
includes examination, on a test basis, of evidence relevant to the amounts and disclosures in the parent company financial statements and the 
part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited. It also includes an assessment of the significant estimates and judgments made by the 
directors in the preparation of the parent company financial statements, and of whether the accounting policies are appropriate to the company’s 
circumstances, consistently applied and adequately disclosed.
We planned and performed our audit so as to obtain all the information and explanations which we considered necessary in order to provide us with 
sufficient evidence to give reasonable assurance that the parent company financial statements and the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report 
to be audited are free from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or other irregularity or error. In forming our opinion we also evaluated the 
overall adequacy of the presentation of information in the parent company financial statements and the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to 
be audited. 107

Notes to the company financial statements
for the year to 31 December 2008
Accounting Policies
The financial statements are prepared under the historical cost convention and in accordance with the Companies Act 1985 and applicable 
Accounting Standards in the United Kingdom. A summary of the principal accounting policies which have been consistently applied, is set out 
below.
Reporting currency
The Company’s transactions are primarily US dollar denominated and the principal functional currency is the US dollar.
The following sterling to US dollar exchange rates have been used in the preparation of these accounts:-
2008 2007
Average rate £1 = $ 1.8484 1.9995
Closing rate £1 = $ 1.4378 1.9906
Investments
Investments in subsidiary undertakings and joint ventures are included in the balance sheet of the Company at cost less any provision for 
impairment.
Impairment
The Company performs impairment reviews in respect of fixed asset investments whenever events or changes in circumstance indicate that the 
carrying amount may not be recoverable. An impairment loss is recognised when the recoverable amount of an asset, which is the higher of the 
asset’s net realisable value and its value in use, is less than its carrying amount.
Deferred taxation
Deferred tax is recognised in respect of all timing differences that have originated but not reversed at the balance sheet date where transactions 
or events that result in an obligation to pay more, or a right to pay less, tax in the future have occurred at the balance sheet date, with the 
following exceptions:-
•	 	 pr ovision	is	made	for	gains	on	disposal	of	fixed	assets	that	have	been	r olled	over	into	r eplacement	assets	only	wher e,	at	the	balance	sheet	
date, there is a commitment to dispose of the replacement assets.
•	 	 pr ovision	is	made	for	the	tax	that	would	arise	on	r emittance	of	the	r etained	ear nings	of	overseas	subsidiaries	only	to	the	extent	that,	at	the	
balance sheet date, dividends have been declared or there is a binding commitment.
•	 	 on	the	basis	of	all	available	evidence	deferr ed	tax	assets	ar e	r ecognised	only	to	the	extent	that	the	Dir ectors	consider	that	it	is	mor e	likely	
than not that there will be suitable taxable profits from which the future reversal of the underlying timing differences can be deducted.
Deferred tax is measured on a non-discounted basis at the rates that are expected to apply in the periods in which timing differences reverse, 
based on tax rates and laws enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date. 110 John Wood Group PLC Annual Report 2008
Energy Supporting Energy
Notes to the company financial statements
for the year to 31 December 2008
Foreign currencies
Transactions in foreign currencies are translated at the exchange rates ruling at the date of the transaction or, where forward contracts have been 
arranged, at the contractual rates. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at the exchange rates ruling at 
the balance sheet dates or at a contractual rate if applicable and any exchange differences are taken to the profit and loss account.
The directors consider it appropriate to record sterling denominated equity share capital in the accounts of John Wood Group PLC at the exchange 
rate ruling on the date it was raised.
Financial instruments
The accounting policy for financial instruments is consistent with the Group accounting policy as presented in the notes to the Group financial 
statements with the exception of the policy on net investment hedges which does not apply to the Company. The Company’s financial risk 
management policy is consistent with the Group’s financial risk management policy outlined in note 18 to the Group financial statements.
Operating leases
As lessee
Payments made under operating leases are charged to the profit and loss account on a straight line basis over the period of the lease.
Use of estimates
The preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets 
and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue during 
the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.
Employee share ownership trusts
The Company is deemed to have control of the assets, liabilities, income and costs of its employee share ownership trusts (“ESOP trusts”). They 
have therefore been included in the financial statements of the Company. Under UITF 38 the cost of shares held by the ESOP trusts is deducted 
from shareholders’ funds.
Share based charges
The Company has a number of share schemes as detailed in the Group accounting policies and notes 21 and 22 to the Group financial statements. 
Details relating to the calculation of share based charges are provided in note 21 to the Group financial statements. In respect of the Company 
the charge is shown as an increase in the Company’s investments, as the employees to which the charge relates are employed by subsidiary 
companies.
Disclosure of impact of new and future accounting standards
The following standards and amendments to existing standards have been published and are mandatory for the Company’s accounting periods 
beginning on or after 1 January 2009 or later periods, but the company has not early adopted them:
•	 	 FRS 	8 	(amendment),	‘Related	party	disclosur es’	(ef fective	 for 	financial	years	beginning	on	or 	after 	6	 April	2008)	
•	 	 FRS 	20	(amendment),	‘Shar e-based	payment’ 	(ef fective	r etr ospectively 	in	annual 	periods	beginning	on	or 	after 	1	 January	2009)	
•	 	 FRS 	25	(amendment),	‘Financial	instruments:	Pr esentation	- 	Puttable	financial	instruments	and	obligations	arising	on	liquidation’	(ef fective	for	
accounting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2010. Early adoption is permitted for accounting periods beginning on or after 1 January 
2009) 111

6 Financial instruments
Financial risk factors
The Company’s activities give rise to a variety of financial risks: market risk (including currency risk and cash flow interest rate risk), credit risk 
and liquidity risk. The Company’s overall risk management strategy is to hedge exposures wherever practicable in order to minimise any potential 
adverse impact on the Company’s financial performance.
Risk management is carried out by the Group Treasury department in line with the Group’s Treasury policies which are approved by the Board of 
Directors. Group Treasury identify, evaluate and where appropriate hedge financial risks. The Group Treasury policies cover specific areas, such 
as foreign exchange risk, interest rate risk, credit risk, use of derivative financial instruments and investment of excess cash.
(a) Market risk
(i) Foreign exchange risk
The Company is exposed to foreign exchange risk arising from various currencies. In order to protect the Company’s balance sheet from 
movements in exchange rates, the Company finances its net investment in non US dollar subsidiaries primarily by means of borrowings 
denominated in the appropriate currency.
Where possible the Company’s policy is to eliminate all significant currency exposures at the time of the transaction by using financial 
instruments such as forward currency contracts. Changes in the forward contract fair values are booked through the profit and loss account.
(ii) Interest rate risk
The Company finances its operations through a mixture of retained profits and bank borrowings. The company borrows in the desired currencies 
at floating rates of interest and then uses interest rate swaps as cash flow hedges to generate the desired interest profile and to manage the 
Company’s exposure to interest rate fluctuations. At 31 December 2008, approximately 43% (2007: 50%) of the Company’s borrowings were at 
fixed rates after taking account of interest rate swaps.
The Company is also exposed to interest rate risk on cash held on deposit. The Company’s policy is to maximise the return on cash deposits 
whilst ensuring that cash is deposited with a financial institution with a credit rating of ‘AA’ or better.
(iii) Price risk
The Company is not exposed to any significant price risk in relation to its financial instruments.
(b) Credit risk
The Company’s credit risk primarily relates to its inter-company loans and inter-company receivables. Management believe that no further risk 
provision is required in excess of the current provision for impairment.
The Company also has credit risk in relation to cash balances or cash held on deposit. The Company’s policy is to deposit cash at institutions 
with an ‘AA’ rating or better where possible. There was no cash held on deposit at 31 December 2008. 114 John Wood Group PLC Annual Report 2008

6 Financial instruments (continued)
(c) Liquidity risk
With regard to liquidity, the Group’s policy is to ensure continuity of funding. At 31 December 2008, 100% (2007: 100%) of the Company’s borrowing 
facilities were due to mature in more than one year. In February 2009, the company extended its bilateral borrowing facilities for a further 3 years. 
Based on the current outlook the Company has sufficient funding in place to meet its future obligations.
(d) Capital risk
The Company’s capital risk is determined by that of the Group.
The table below analyses the Company’s financial liabilities which will be settled on a net basis into relevant maturity groupings based on the

Dividends
We declare our dividend in US dollars. As a result of the 
shareholders being mainly UK based, dividends will be paid in 
sterling, but if you would like to receive your dividend in US dollars 
please contact the Registrars at the address below. All shareholders 
will receive dividends in sterling unless requested. If you are a UK 
based shareholder, the Company encourages you to have your 
dividends paid through the BACS (Banker’s Automated Clearing 
Services) system. The benefit of the BACS payment method is that 
the Registrars post the tax vouchers directly to the shareholders, 
whilst the dividend is credited on the payment date to the 
shareholder’s Bank or Building Society account. UK shareholders
who have not yet arranged for their dividends to be paid direct to 
their Bank or Building Society account and wish to benefit from this 
service should contact the Registrars at the address below. 
Sterling dividends will be translated at the closing mid-point spot 
rate on 17 April 2009 as published in the Financial Times on 18 April 
2009.

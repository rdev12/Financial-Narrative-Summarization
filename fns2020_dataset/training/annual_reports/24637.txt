I am extremely proud to announce today’s 
record results which show rental levels, 
investment gains, pre-tax profits, 
shareholders’ funds and EPRA net asset 
value per share all at the highest level in 
Helical’s 32 year history as a real estate 
company . These results clearly demonstrate 
that our strategy of targeting London for 
capital growth and development profits and 
the regions for higher yielding investment 
assets provides the most appropriate 
allocation of resources to enable us to 
meet our long term objectives. 
The greatest proportion of our performance this year has come 
from London where we have increased our portfolio weighting, 
primarily with the purchase of The Bower EC1. We also increased 
our weighting in industrial assets whilst reducing our exposure to 
retail. We sold our Polish assets and continue to deliver on our 
retirement village programme. 
Within the investment portfolio we have a strong and diverse tenant 
profile. We have increased contracted rents by £12.7m (29% increase) 
from new lettings and by capturing some of the reversionary 
potential of the portfolio and expect this growth to continue. Our 
London investment portfolio remains highly reversionary and its 
inherent value will be unlocked through the completion of our 
redevelopment and refurbishment programme and the letting of 
the vacant and remaining reversionary space. London continues 
to outperform the rest of the UK and our strategy is to increase 
our London holdings. 
We now have an investment portfolio poised for future earnings 
growth which, if supported by a benign economic background, 
should lead to substantial capital appreciation. 
PERFORMANCE 
We measure our performance at both portfolio and Company level, 
seeking to outperform in the medium and long term relevant sector 
indices and our peer group.
EPRA earnings per share increased from 2.4p to 17.1p, reflecting 
growing net rental income and increased development profits. On 
a like-for-like basis, the investment portfolio increased by 14.9% 
(11.1% including sales and purchases) contributing to an overall 
growth in the portfolio to £1,240m (2015: £1,021m). The unleveraged 
return of our property portfolio, as measured by IPD, was 21.7% 
(2015: 20.4%), compared to 11.4% (2015: 17.5%) for the benchmark 
index. These investment gains contributed to an increase in EPRA 
net asset value per share, up 19.7% to 461p (2015: 385p). Since the 
start of 2016, the listed real estate sector has been affected by 
concerns over global economic issues and the forthcoming 
referendum on our membership of the European Union. Despite 
this, we achieved a positive Total Shareholder Return for the year 
to 31 March 2016 of 1.0% (2015: 7.6%), compared to the sector 
index which fell by 6.4% (2015: increase of 22.8%).

CHIEF EXECUTIVE’S STATEMENT
RESULTS FOR THE YEAR
The profit before tax for the year to 31 March 2016 was £120.1m 
(2015: £87.4m), the highest in the Group’s history. Total Property 
Return increased by 10% to £170.6m (2015: £155.3m) and included 
growing net rents of £43.4m, an increase of 12% on 2015 (£38.6m), 
and development profits of £27.5m (2015: £17.6m). The gain on 
sale and revaluation of the investment portfolio contributed £99.7m 
(2015: £96.6m) and there were no trading profits (2015: £2.5m). 
Net finance costs of £22.6m were lower than in 2015 (£24.8m), 
however the income statement was adversely affected by falls in 
expected future interest rates which led to a £6.9m (2015: £8.4m) 
charge arising from the valuation of the Group’s derivative 
financial instruments. The valuation of the Group’s Convertible 
Bond provided a credit of £0.5m (2015: charge of £3.3m). 
Recurring administration costs were marginally higher at £10.7m 
(2015: £10.2m). Performance related awards, reflecting the success 
of the Group’s activities in the year were £13.3m (2015: £13.4m). 
National Insurance costs on remuneration, including performance 
related awards, were £2.1m (2015: £3.0m).
These results allow the Board to continue its progressive dividend 
policy and to recommend to shareholders a final dividend of 0.72p 
which, together with the two interim dividends paid to date of 
7.45p takes the total dividend for the year to 8.17p (2015: 7.25p), 
an overall increase of 12.7%.
THE LONDON PORTFOLIO
The London investment and development portfolio continues to 
contribute the greater proportion of capital growth and development 
profits. In the year to 31 March 2016, London provided c. 80% of 
the total property return of £170.6m (2015: £155.3m). 
Since 2010 we have steadily acquired property in two “clusters”; 
the Tech Belt districts of Farringdon, Shoreditch, Aldgate and 
through to Whitechapel and the West London districts of 
Hammersmith, Shepherds Bush and Chiswick.
The East 
At The Bower EC1, we have acquired the outstanding 2/3rd interest 
from our joint venture partner Crosstree Real Estate Partners LLP 
(“Crosstree”), of the buildings known as The Warehouse (122,858 
sq ft of offices, 5,404 sq ft of restaurant use) and The Studio 
(18,283 sq ft of offices, 4,894 sq ft of restaurant use). Construction 
work on these two buildings was completed in November 2015 
and both are fully let at average office rents of £55.00 psf and 
£43.85 psf respectively. In addition, we have acquired The Tower 
at 207 Old Street, a 179,000 sq ft refurbishment and extension of 
the existing building on which work has commenced and is due 
for completion Q1 2018. At £248m, this purchase is our largest 
ever acquisition and strongly reaffirms our belief in the London 
office market. The remaining buildings at The Bower, being Empire 
House and the retail parade, were sold by the joint venture to 
Standard Life and Crosstree respectively.
At Barts Square EC1, our scheme in joint venture with The Baupost 
Group LLC, we have now exchanged contracts for sale at an 
average of £1,580 psf on 102 of the 144 residential units with a 
further two units reserved in phase 1 of the development which is 
due for completion in summer 2017. The office development of 
212,858 sq ft at One Bartholomew Close EC1 has been forward 
funded with clients of Ashby Capital, is currently under construction 
and is due for completion in July 2018.
Our 272,426 sq ft office development at One Creechurch Place EC3, 
equity funded with our joint venture partner HOOPP (Healthcare 
of Ontario Pension Plan) is expected to complete in September 
2016. C-Space EC1 completed its refurbishment in October 2015 
and is 75% let at an average rent of £56 psf. At 23-28 Charterhouse 
Square EC1 we have commenced construction works, due to 
complete in Q1 2017 on a refurbishment which will comprise 
38,500 sq ft of offices and 5,100 sq ft of retail/restaurant use.  
Our 112,000 sq ft listed building at The Loom, Whitechapel E1 is 
now undergoing a comprehensive refurbishment and is due for 
completion in September 2016.
The West
There has been substantial growth in rents at our West London 
properties. At Shepherd’s Building W14 we have completed the 
lease renewal and increased the space let to our largest tenant 
Endemol, increasing the rent by £1.25m pa, with average rents for 
the building now £45.75 psf. At One King Street W6 following the 
completion of the refurbishment works, we have achieved a 
benchmark rent for the area of £55.00 psf. We have added to  
our portfolio with the acquisition of Power Road Studios W4, 
62,000 sq ft of offices over five buildings acquired for £34m. 
THE REGIONAL PORTFOLIO
The regional investment and development portfolio provides a 
growing stream of net rents from a high yielding investment 
portfolio while contributing development profits from our 
retirement village and retail development programmes. 
The regional investment portfolio increased to £460m at 31 March 
2016 (2015: £420m) with the addition of 13 distribution warehouses 
and a regional office for an aggregate £94m, offset by the sale of 
eight distribution warehouses, five retail assets and three regional 
offices for £67m. Regional assets contributed £31.0m of net rental 
income during the year (2015: £30.7m) which is expected to 
continue to grow with contracted rents on the portfolio of £32m 
and an ERV of £36m. Net gains on the sale and revaluation of the 
regional portfolio contributed £6.7m (2015: £18.8m).
Our regional development exposure is limited to our retirement 
village and out-of-town retail development programmes and our 
Scottish Power project in Glasgow, where balance sheet risk is 
limited. At our retirement village development programme we 
continued the construction of units at Durrants Village Horsham, 
Millbrook Village Exeter and Maudslay Park Great Alne, near 
Stratford-upon-Avon. During the year we completed the clubhouse 
at Durrants Village and sold 33 residential units at the three schemes 
(2015: 25 units). In our retail development programme, we have 
completed our scheme at Shirley, West Midlands and continue to 
make progress on our scheme at Truro. Subsequent to the year end 
we forward funded a 79,750 sq ft out-of-town retail development 
at Cortonwood with a client of Aberdeen Asset Management. The 
Scottish Power project is pre-let and pre-sold and due for completion 
in September 2016. As part of the overall deal Helical takes on three 
existing Scottish Power sites which are surplus to requirements. 
One has been sold and good progress is being made on the 
business plans for the other two.  HELICAL BAR PLC REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2016 16
CHIEF EXECUTIVE’S STATEMENT
FINANCE
The Group has expanded its activities significantly in the last three 
years, seeking to increase shareholder funds through the generation 
and retention of increased net rental streams, development profits 
and valuation surpluses. This growth has been financed through an 
increase in secured debt borrowed primarily from UK high street 
banks and, since 2013, through the use of unsecured debt in the 
form of a retail bond and a convertible bond. In assessing the needs 
of the business the Company is conscious that it needs to manage 
any risks inherent in this leveraged approach to growing the business. 
It seeks to do this through the use of unsecured debt (23% of total 
debt), by increasing the maturity of its debt profile and by hedging 
its interest rate exposure. In addition, the Group’s debt profile 
includes borrowings in respect of residential and retirement village 
developments which are expected to be repaid as sales complete. 
In pursuing this strategy, the Group has increased the average debt 
maturity to 4.5 years (2015: 4.3 years), with no secured loan repayable 
before November 2019, whilst marginally increasing the average 
cost of debt at 4.2% (2015: 4.1%). The Group continues to retain a 
significant level of liquidity with cash and unutilised bank facilities 
of £193m (2015: £229m) to fund capital works on its portfolio. 
BOARD CHANGES
As previously announced with our half year results, I will be handing 
over the reins of the Company to Gerald Kaye, our senior development 
director for the last 22 years, and I will stand to be elected as  
Non-Executive Chairman, at the 2016 Annual General Meeting.  
At that AGM, Nigel McNair Scott, our current Chairman, former 
Finance Director and my close friend and confidant, will retire 
after 30 years on the Board. Nigel has proved to be a constant 
source of advice, support and wisdom during his time at Helical 
and I wish him a long and happy retirement. 
The AGM will also see the retirement of Andrew Gulliford, a 
Non-Executive director for the last ten years. Andrew has also 
proved to be a tremendous support to the Board and his 
contribution is greatly appreciated. With these two planned 
departures we have sought to strengthen the Board with the 
addition of two new independent Non-Executive Directors and 
were delighted to be able to announce the appointments of  
Susan Clayton and Richard Cotton earlier this year.
OUTLOOK
Since 2012, we have targeted an income producing investment 
portfolio representing at least 75% of our total property assets and 
a development programme of the remaining 25% which is capable 
of producing exceptional profits. We have now exceeded our original 
targets and, as we complete the current development programme 
over the next three years, our objectives are clear. We seek to:
•  Complete and let our London office schemes at The Bower, 
One Creechurch Place, One Bartholomew Close and 23-28 
Charterhouse Square; 
•  Complete the residential scheme at Barts Square and sell the 
remaining units;
•  Take forward our London schemes in Hammersmith and Drury 
Lane and at the appropriate time restock the London development 
pipeline to enable us to continue to create capital growth and 
development profits; 
• Capture the reversion in our investment portfolio; and,
• Maintain and grow a sustainable investment income surplus. 
We aim to do this against a background of increasing uncertainty, 
exacerbated by the imminent possibility of the UK voting to leave 
the European Union. However, with substantially increased 
contracted rents on our portfolio and having de-risked our two 
largest London office developments at One Creechurch Place EC3 
and One Bartholomew Close EC1, Helical is well placed to deal 
with any headwinds that may come its way. 
Finally, this will be my last Chief Executive’s Statement after nearly 
32 years with the Company. I joined the Board on the 21 August 
1984 when the equivalent share price was around one pence per 
share giving a market capitalisation of circa £800,000 and with 
Helical Bar plc a steel company making reinforcement bars for  
the construction industry. I joined the Company to change things.  
A quick sale of the steel business followed by over 30 years as  
an entrepreneurial property company, Helical has grown to have  
a current market capitalisation of over £460m having distributed 
£276m to shareholders during that period. I now look forward to 
becoming Chairman and leave the Company in the excellent 
hands of my successor, Gerald Kaye, and the wider executive 
team who have an average tenure with the Company of a mere  
19 years! I look forward to continuing both on the Board and as 
the Company’s largest shareholder and am confident that Helical’s 
outperformance will continue.

STRUCTURE AND FUNDING LOCATE ASSETS
OUR STRATEGY
We use our knowledge of the market 
and our extensive network of contacts 
to seek out assets where we see the 
potential to add significant value. Our 
development schemes are focused on 
delivering innovative and modern space, 
whilst retaining local character. We target 
areas where we anticipate strong growth. 
Our asset management opportunities 
focus on maximising income through 
attracting and maintaining a balanced 
and diverse portfolio of tenants and driving 
increases in the rental value through 
refurbishment programmes that make 
intelligent use of space and deliver high 
yielding assets. 
When the Group identifies assets that it intends to develop or asset manage and hold  
for the longer term, it uses its own capital combined with appropriate external debt. 
Where we see significant potential to create profit in the short to medium term and are 
keen to limit our equity commitment and risk exposure, we look to bring in a partner.  
Our approach to working with our partners includes:
•  Co-investing alongside a larger partner where we have a minority equity stake, whilst 
receiving a “waterfall” payment whereby we obtain a greater profit share than the percentage 
of our investment, depending upon the profitability of the project. This strategy is used 
for the developments at Barts Square, London EC1 and One Creechurch Place, London EC3. 
•  Managing the development process from site acquisition, through construction to letting 
or sale. In these structures we do not own the asset, committing no or minimum equity. 
Our return is linked to the profitability of the development, allowing us to potentially benefit 
from a significant profit that reflects our contribution to the project’s success. We are using 
this strategy in the development of the office at One Bartholomew Close, London EC1.

OUR STRATEGY
DEVELOP , LET & ASSET MANAGE EXIT
Determining the most appropriate time to sell 
an asset is critical in crystallising value. We look 
to dispose of a property when we believe future 
market growth is limited, where we have limited 
opportunity to add further value or when we 
see greater value elsewhere. Our view of the 
market and the availability of other opportunities 
determines whether we reinvest the equity into 
new properties, repay debt or return capital to 
shareholders. 
We actively manage our assets from inception to completion. Our 
close involvement allows us to continue to develop and improve the 
design whilst being able to rapidly respond to challenges as they arise. 
Key to this is working closely with trusted contractors who share our 
values and are focused on quality, health and safety, sustainability and 
consideration for the local community.
Building strong relationships with our tenants and having a good 
understanding of their business, combined with a detailed knowledge 
of the market, is fundamental to our approach to maximising rental 
value and maintaining a high level of occupancy. We actively look to 
redevelop space where we can see the opportunity to better meet 
market demands, allowing us to drive rental value and help secure the 
future of the asset.
We actively MANAGE OUR 
ASSETS THROUGHOUT 
THEIR DEVELOPMENT, 
working with trusted 
contractors and focusing  
on quality, efficiency and 
safety.
We look to LET OUR 
PROPERTIES to diverse 
tenants who are financially 
robust.
Through clever ASSET 
MANAGEMENT we drive  
the rental value forward 
while maximising 
occupancy.

right point in the market

INVESTMENT PROPERTY DATABANK
The Investment Property Databank (“IPD”) produces a number of independent 
benchmarks of property returns which are regarded as the main industry indices. 
IPD has compared the ungeared performance of Helical’s total property portfolio against 
that of portfolios within IPD for the last 20 years. The Group’s annual performance target is 
to exceed the top quartile of the IPD database, which it has consistently achieved. Helical’s 
ungeared performance for the year to 31 March 2016 was 21.7% (2015: 20.4%) compared to 
the IPD median benchmark of 11.4% (2015: 17.5%) and upper quartile benchmark of 13.0% 
(2015: 19.6%).

AVERAGE LENGTH OF EMPLOYEE SERVICE (YEARS)
High levels of staff retention remain a key feature of Helical’s business. The Group 
retains a highly skilled and experienced team. Opposite is the average length of 
service of the Group’s head office employees.
The principal driver for the fall in average length of employee service is the 
increased employee numbers due to the growth of the business.
EPRA NET ASSET VALUE PER SHARE (PENCE)
A property company’s share price should reflect growth in net assets per share. 
Our Group’s main objective is to maximise growth in assets from increases in 
investment portfolio values and from retained earnings from other property 
related activities. Net asset value per share represents the share of net assets 
attributable to each ordinary share. Whilst the basic and diluted net asset per 
share calculations provide a guide to performance, the property industry prefers to 
use an EPRA adjusted net asset per share to represent the fair value of net assets 
on an ongoing long term basis. The adjustments necessary to arrive at this figure 
are shown in note 34 of the financial statements. 
Management is incentivised to exceed 15% pa growth in net asset value per share.
We measure our performance using a number of financial  
and non-financial key performance indicators (“KPIs”).
We incentivise management to outperform the Group’s competitors by setting appropriate levels 
for performance indicators against which rewards are measured. We also design our remuneration 
packages to align management’s interests with shareholders’ aspirations. Key to this is the 
monitoring and reporting against identifiable performance targets and benchmarks. HELICAL BAR PLC REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2016 21 STRATEGIC REPORT

THE LONDON PORTFOLIO
PROPERTY PORTFOLIO
London’s economy continues to 
outperform the rest of the UK and the 
proportion of our assets located in the 
Capital now represents 56% of our 
investment portfolio. London’s 
population is expected to grow by one 
million in the next ten years and 175,000 
new office jobs are expected to be 
created by 2020. London is a leading 
technology centre and there is a “war for 
talent” which is driving demand for high 
quality office space. London continues 
to attract overseas capital as it has a 
liquid and transparent property market 
with a long established rule of law.
Our strategy is to increase our London holdings, focusing on 
select areas where we see strong tenant demand and growth 
potential, such as the “Tech Belt” that runs from Kings Cross 
through Old Street and Shoreditch to Whitechapel and in West 
London, in particular Hammersmith, Shepherds Bush and Chiswick. 
Our London portfolio comprises income producing multi-let offices, 
office refurbishments and developments and residential 
development schemes.

THE REGIONAL PORTFOLIO 
Our regional portfolio contributed 71% 
of our net rental income from tenants in 
diverse sectors and geographical locations. 
The £568.8m regional portfolio comprises 
£210.5m of industrial/logistics (37% of 
the portfolio), £103.5m of offices (18%), 
£142.6m of retail comprising £76.9m of 
retail warehousing and £65.7m of in-town 
retail, mainly the Morgan Quarter, Cardiff 
(in aggregate 25%), £103.5m in our 
retirement village development programme 
(18%) and £8.7m of land (2%).
Our approach to regional investment is to acquire assets where occupational 
demand is robust throughout the property cycle and the barriers to new 
supply are high. Successfully picking the sectors and assets with these 
attributes will ensure strong cash flows and rental growth. In general, yields 
for regional assets are higher than those in London and these assets are 
acquired to provide significant cash flow for the Group. We anticipate that 
income will become an increasingly important part of total returns as yield 
compression slows and, as such, we focus our attention on areas where we 
believe the occupational market remains robust.

ST VINCENT STREET, 
GLASGOW
In partnership with local development partner, Dawn Developments 
Ltd, Helical is the development manager for the construction of the 
new headquarters building for Scottish Power at St Vincent Street, 
Glasgow. The completed building will comprise c. 220,000 sq ft of 
prime offi  ce space in the heart of the City’s commercial district. 
Funded by M&G Investments, the scheme is under construction and all 
works, including Scottish Power’s fi t out, are due to be completed by 
Autumn 2016. As part of the overall deal, Helical took on three existing 
Scottish Power sites which were surplus to requirements. We have 
received planning permission for a change of use of the grounds of 
Cathcart House to 158 residential units and are in discussions with a 
number of parties in relation to a sale. At Yoker, we have exchanged 
contracts, subject to planning, with a supermarket operator to sell the 
site, and we sold the site at Falkirk during the year.
Our regional offi  ce investment portfolio 
comprises nine assets valued at £102.5m, 
with over 60% of value in Manchester. 
Other assets are located in Crawley, 
Glasgow, Reading, Cobham, Castle 
Donington and Cheadle. During the 
year we sold three assets for £11.2m, 
a 16% premium to book value.
We now have three offi  ces in Manchester 
having acquired Fountain Court, 31 Booth 
Street earlier this year. Manchester is a 
city with a diverse, thriving and growing 
economy and is widely regarded as 
England’s second city and the centre 
of the “Northern Powerhouse”. 
CHURCHGATE & LEE HOUSE, 
MANCHESTER 
Helical acquired Churchgate and Lee House, 
two interlinked offi  ce buildings comprising 
248,000 sq ft of offi  ces, in March 2014. We 
have refurbished the reception, café and a 
number of offi  ce fl oors and continue to 
reposition the asset as fl oors become vacant. 
We have concluded 14,000 sq ft of new 
lettings in the year, including letting a 
refurbished second fl oor Churchgate suite 
at £16.50 psf, with a further 19,300 sq ft 
since year end. The building is now 92% 
occupied. HELICAL BAR PLC REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2016 41 STRATEGIC REPORT

Helical has 36 distribution and light industrial units located 
around major UK transport networks, a net increase of fi ve units 
with 13 acquisitions (£89m) being off set by sales of eight units 
with (£28m) at a small premium to book value. These units 
generally have few bespoke features making them straightforward 
to re-let if vacancies occur with minimal capital expenditure 
required. The majority of the assets are single let. Signifi cant 
assets within the portfolio include a 256,000 sq ft distribution 
warehouse let to Sainsbury’s in Yate, Bristol, a 203,000 sq ft 
facility in Leighton Buzzard, Bedfordshire, a 210,000 sq ft 
distribution warehouse in Northampton and a 183,000 sq ft 
distribution warehouse let to the Royal Mail in Chester.
DALE HOUSE
MANCHESTER
Dale House is a 42,000 sq ft offi  ce building situated in the 
Northern Quarter of Manchester. It is 85% let to a number of 
tenants with an average rent of £12.00 psf and was acquired in 
March 2015 for £7.4m. The property is a long term hold with plans 
to refurbish the building over time and move rents upwards as the 
location improves.
FOUNTAIN COURT
31 BOOTH STREET, MANCHESTER
This vacant offi  ce located in the prime city core was acquired in 
January 2016 for £4.7m. Refurbishment of this 25,349 sq ft

RETAIL
Our retail assets total £142.6m, 11.5% 
of our portfolio (31 March 2015: £171.7m). 
This part of the portfolio includes a 
prime retail asset in Cardiff, eight retail 
parks (one of which has been sold since 
the year end), one retail unit and a 
number of pre let and/or prefunded 
retail developments. 
The retail market is undergoing major 
structural changes with high profile 
companies going into administration. 
There is a continued migration of 
customers and retailers to prime centres 
where the leisure offer and quality of 
environment are a big driver of footfall 
which is benefitting our most 
substantial retail holding in Cardiff. 
During the year, five retail properties 
were sold for a total of £27.0m. At the 
year end the portfolio consisted of 
assets in Cardiff, Ellesmere Port, Great 
Yarmouth, Harrogate, Huddersfield, 
Leicester, Scarborough, Sevenoaks, 
Southend and Stockport. Harrogate 
has been sold since the year end at  
its book value.
THE MORGAN QUARTER AND 
ROYAL ARCADES, CARDIFF
Tenant demand for the property is strong 
and rents are steadily increasing. The 
creative quarter office refurbishment is 
now largely complete generating £116,000 
of rent from previously unusable space, 
with a further c. £80,000 of rent to follow 
as the remainder of the new space is let. 
The Morgan Quarter was originally 
purchased in 2005 and comprised the 
David Morgan Department Store and two 
Victorian Arcades. The main ground floor 
retail units fronting The Hayes, a prime 
fashion pitch in Cardiff, have been completely 
reconfigured and they are now let to 
tenants such as White Stuff, Urban 
Outfitters, Molton Brown, Jack Wills  
and Fred Perry. HELICAL BAR PLC REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2016 43 STRATEGIC REPORT

PARKGATE 
SHIRLEY , WEST MIDLANDS
The shopping centre at Parkgate, Shirley, 
where Helical has a 50% interest, was 
completed in 2014 and the 80,000 sq ft 
Asda, which had been pre-sold to the 
food-store, together with a number of 
other retailers have all opened successfully 
for trade. The space beyond the food-store 
is let to occupiers such as B&M, Peacocks, 
Poundland, Pizza Express, JD Wetherspoon, 
Prezzo, Shoe Zone and Shirley Library. 
A second phase of high density residential 
is being progressed on a 10 acre site opposite 
the Parkgate scheme. Terms have been 
agreed with a care home provider, a 
residential developer and a supermarket 
operator for a petrol filling station. Planning 
consent has been achieved subject to a 
S106 Agreement.
 
CORTONWOOD
This 79,750 sq ft retail park has been 95% pre-let to tenants including Outfit, H&M, 
New Look, River Island and Marks and Spencer. The scheme has been forward funded 
with clients of Aberdeen Asset Management and construction on site has started with 
completion due in June 2017.
TRURO
Helical has entered into a 
Conditional Purchase Agreement 
on the six acre Truro City Football 
Club site which has planning 
consent, subject to a S106 
Agreement, for a 78,000 sq ft 
non-food retail park. The scheme 
proposals provide for the 
relocation of the football club and 
we anticipate starting on site in 
summer 2017. 
POLAND 
During the year, we completed the sale of 
our 50% share in the 720,000 sq ft retail 
development at Europa Centralna, Gliwice, 
Poland, to our joint venture partners, clients 
of Standard Life, in accordance with a 
pre-arranged contractual exit two years 
post completion of the scheme. The sale, 
at book value, reduced gross property 
assets by £41m and reduced net debt by 
£26m. In July 2015, we also completed the 
sale of our 103,000 sq ft retail development 
at Wroclaw, Poland at €17m, a small premium 
to book value. The sale of these two assets 
completed the exit of our joint venture in 
Poland.  HELICAL BAR PLC REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2016 44

RETIREMENT  
VILLAGES
Our retirement village portfolio consists of four villages. 
We design each of the villages with an active, independent 
retirement in mind and the communities that we create are 
the ideal place to live a social and varied lifestyle. Each 
private, age-exclusive retirement community is centred 
around a residents’ clubhouse, and feature many amenities 
including an indoor pool and gym, landscaped gardens, bar, 
restaurant and library. With an increasing UK population 
over 65 years old, and a severe under supply in retirement 
housing, this sector creates significant opportunities for 
investors and developers. This year has seen us bring the 
management of this portfolio entirely in house which has 
led to an increase in sales rates. 
1 BRAMSHOTT PLACE  
LIPHOOK, HAMPSHIRE
This village is situated amongst natural parkland near the village 
of Liphook on the border of Hampshire, West Sussex and Surrey. 
The village features a selection of two and three bedroom cottages 
and one, two and three bedroom apartments arranged around a 
residents’ clubhouse. All 151 units in Phase 1-3 have been completed 
and sold. Phase 4 will commence in 2016 with the construction of 
40 additional cottages. Enabling works have commenced on site 
with completion due in June 2018.

ASSET MANAGEMENT 
Asset management is a critical component 
in driving Helical’s performance. Through 
having intelligent business plans and by 
maximising the combined skills of our 
management team, we are able to create 
value in our assets without relying on 
market movements.
During the year contracted income increased by £12.7m as a result 
of new lettings and rent reviews, net of any losses from breaks and 
lease expiries (2015: £1.1m). With notable contributions from some 
regional assets, in particular Churchgate and Lee House in Manchester, 
the majority of these rental increases come from our London assets. 
The completion and letting of phase 1 at The Bower EC1 and 
C-Space EC1 contributed £10.5m of new lettings, while the renewal 
of the Endemol lease in the Shepherds Building W14 added a 
further £1.3m to the rent roll. The London portfolio remains highly 
reversionary and this value will continue to be unlocked through 
refurbishment and leasing activities. 
There was significant activity within the investment portfolio with 
165 lease events.

FINANCIAL REVIEW
Helical aims to deliver market leading 
returns by committing to projects with 
the potential for substantial capital 
growth and by deploying limited equity 
into development situations which have 
the potential to be highly profitable. 
Risks associated with our development programme are mitigated 
through limited equity exposure, options, forward funding, 
conditional contracts and joint ventures with major UK and global 
institutions. We have an active asset management programme for 
the investment portfolio with a clear strategy of increasing net 
operating income. 
Our aim is to have a stable platform with all recurring operational 
and finance costs and dividends fully covered by revenue streams 
from our investment portfolio. Gearing is used on a tactical basis 
throughout the property cycle, being raised to accentuate 
property performance when property returns are judged to 
materially outperform the cost of debt and lowered when seeking 
to reduce exposure to the property cycle. 
SEE-THROUGH ANAL YSIS 
Since 2010 Helical has held a significant proportion of its property 
assets in joint ventures with partners that provide the majority of 
the equity required to purchase the assets, whilst relying on the 
Group to provide asset management or development expertise. 
Accounting convention requires Helical to account under IFRS for 
our share of the net results and net assets of joint ventures in 
limited detail in the income statement and balance sheet. Net 
asset value per share, a key performance measure used in the real 
estate industry, as reported in the financial statements under IFRS, 
does not provide stakeholders with the most relevant information 
on the fair value of assets and liabilities within an ongoing real 
estate company with a long term investment strategy.
In this review and elsewhere in this statement, we have incorporated 
the separate components into a more detailed “see-through” analysis 
of our property portfolio and debt profile and the associated 
income streams and financing costs to assist in providing a more 
comprehensive overview of the Group’s activities. This see-through 
analysis can be found in Appendix 1.
RESULTS FOR THE YEAR
For the third year running we are delighted to be able to report on 
excellent results with record pre-tax profits of £120m in the year to 
31 March 2016 (2015: £87m). Continued rental growth, good 
development profits and strong valuation surpluses arose from of the 
implementation of our London development and asset 
management strategies.
The Group’s real estate portfolio, including its share of assets held in 
joint venture, increased to £1,240m (2015: £1,021m) largely the result 
of acquiring the remaining 2/3rd share of The Bower, London EC1, 
plus substantial gains on sales and revaluation of the investment 
portfolio.
The continued expansion of the Group’s activities has resulted in an 
increase in its loan to value to 55% (2015: 52%) and an increase in 
see-through net gearing to 140% (2015: 132%). The Group 
lengthened its borrowings profile, repaying short term facilities and 
extending existing secured loans. These actions enabled the 
Group to extend its overall debt maturity profile to 4.5 years 
(2015: 4.3 years) with a weighted average cost of debt marginally 
increasing to 4.2% (2015: 4.1%). HELICAL BAR PLC REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2016 51 STRATEGIC REPORT

EPRA NET ASSET VALUE
EPRA net asset value per share increased by 19.7% to 461p per 
share (2015: 385p). This increase arose principally from a total 
comprehensive income (retained profits) of £110.3m (2015: 
£74.9m) less dividends paid of £14.4m (2015: £7.9m) and reflecting 
a reduction in the surplus on valuation of the trading and 
development stock to £19.4m (2015: £36.2m).

INCOME STATEMENT
RENTAL INCOME AND PROPERTY OVERHEADS
Gross rental income receivable by the Group in respect of wholly 
owned properties increased by 19% to £45.5m (2015: £38.3m) 
reflecting the growth in the investment portfolio and the partial 
capture of its reversionary potential. In the joint ventures, gross 
rents fell from £6.1m to £1.8m reflecting the sale of Clyde Shopping 
Centre in March 2015. Property overheads in respect of wholly 
owned assets and in respect of those assets in joint ventures fell 
significantly from £5.4m to £3.4m reflecting the rotation out of 
management intensive secondary shopping centres to high 
yielding distribution warehouses, regional offices and out-of-town 
retail parks. After taking account of net rents payable to our profit 
share partners of £0.5m (2015: £0.3m), see-through net rents 
increased by 12.4% to £43.4m (2015: £38.6m).

DEVELOPMENT PROFITS 
Developments profits increased by 56% from £17.6m to £27.5m on 
a see-through basis. The main contributor was in respect of the 
development management fees of £23.2m crystallised by the 
acquisition of The Bower, London EC1. We also received development 
management fees of £3.7m in respect of the development at the 
Scottish Power headquarters in Glasgow and at One Creechurch 
Place, London EC3. Our retirement village programme contributed 
£0.4m of profits. In our joint ventures we recognised £3.2m of 
development profit on our schemes at Leisure Plaza and Shirley. 
Set against these profits was a write-down of £0.9m against a site 
in Telford and £1.8m against our retail development programme. 
SHARE OF RESULTS OF JOINT VENTURES
The results of the joint ventures include our share of The Bower, 
London EC1 until it was acquired and fully consolidated in January 
2016; our development schemes at Barts Square, London EC1; 
One Creechurch Place, London EC3; Shirley Town Centre, West 
Midlands; Leisure Plaza and C.4.1, both Milton Keynes; and King 
Street, London W6. Detailed analysis of our share of these joint 
ventures is provided in note 19 to this report and in the see-through 
analysis in Appendix 1. In the year under review, net rents of £1.3m 
(2015: £4.4m) were received, offset by net finance costs of £3.7m 
(2015: £3.6m). Gains on the sale or revaluation of the investment 
assets of £43.9m (2015: £27.2m) arose primarily in respect of The 
Bower, London EC1 and Barts Square, London EC1. Net of taxes, 
our joint ventures contributed £50.5m (2015: £27.5m).  HELICAL BAR PLC REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2016 52
FINANCIAL REVIEW
GAIN ON SALE AND REVALUATION OF INVESTMENT 
PROPERTIES 
During the year we sold two London assets, Enterprise House W2, 
a 45,000 sq ft office building let to Network Rail for 20 years and 
Artillery Lane E1, a 17,000 sq ft refurbished office building, for 
total gross proceeds of £57m, a small premium to book value. In 
the regions we sold eight industrial units, three offices and five 
retail assets, a total of 16 regional assets, for £67m at a small net 
premium to book value.
The valuation of our investment portfolio reflected our increased 
exposure to London offices where we generated an increase of 
18.8% overall and 30.8% on a like-for-like basis. The regions 
contributed 1.1% overall and 1.2% on a like-for-like basis. In total, 
the investment portfolio showed a valuation increase of 11.1%, or 
14.9% on a like-for-like basis.
The total impact on our financial statements of the gain on sale 
and revaluation of our investment portfolio was a net gain of 
£99.7m (2015: £96.6m).

ADMINISTRATION COSTS 
Administration costs, before performance related awards, increased 
by 5% from £10.2m to £10.7m. This increase arose from employing a 
greater number of asset managers, development executives and in 
the finance team as the portfolio increased and we move through 
the delivery phase of the development programme.
Performance related share awards and bonus payments, before 
National Insurance costs, were £13.3m (2015: £13.4m). Of this 
amount, the £6.7m (2015: £6.4m) charge for share awards under the 
Performance Share Plans is expensed through the Income Statement 
but added back to Shareholders’ Funds through the Statement of 
Changes in Equity. The £6.6m (2015: £6.9m) charge for bonus 
payments comprises £5.5m (2015: £5.8m) which will be paid in 
June 2016 and £1.1m (2015: £1.1.m) which will be paid in deferred 
shares to be held for a minimum of three years. In addition, National 
Insurance of £2.1m (2015: £3.0m) has been accrued in the year.

FINANCE COSTS, FINANCE INCOME AND DERIVATIVE 
FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS 
Interest payable on secured bank loans including our share of loans 
on assets held in joint ventures, but before capitalised interest, 
increased to £20.2m (2015: £16.7m). Interest payable in respect of 
the unsecured Retail and Convertible Bonds was £8.8m (2015: £8.0m). 
The continued fall in medium and long term interest rate projections 
at 31 March 2016 contributed to a charge of £6.9m (2015: £8.4m) 
on the derivative financial instruments which have been valued on a 
mark to market basis. Capitalised interest increased from £3.6m to 
£4.9m as development schemes progressed. Other interest payable 
reduced to £3.7m from £6.3m (which includes £2.8m of costs incurred 
in issuing the Convertible Bond). T otal finance costs increased from 
£27.3m to £27.8m. Finance income earned was £5.1m (2015: £2.5m).
TAXATION
Helical pays corporation tax on its net rental income, trading and 
development profits and realised chargeable gains, after offset of 
administration and finance costs. 
The deferred tax charge for the year is principally derived from 
the revaluation surpluses recognised in the year offset by the 
recognition of tax losses which the Group believes will be utilised 
against profits in the foreseeable future.
DIVIDENDS
Helical follows a progressive dividend policy increasing its dividends 
in line with its results, whilst retaining the majority of funds generated 
for investment in growing the business. The interim dividend paid 
on 30 December 2015 of 2.30p was an increase of 9.5% on the 
previous interim dividend of 2.10p. On 4 April 2016, the Company 
paid a second interim of 5.15p and together with the final dividend 
of 0.72p payable on 29 July 2016, this is an increase of 14.0% on 
the previous year (2015: 5.15p). In total, the dividend paid or payable 
in respect of the results for the year to 31 March 2016 is 8.17p 
(2015: 7.25p), an increase of 12.7%. Since 2013 the compound 
annual growth rate of the Company’s dividends has been 13.8%.

BALANCE SHEET
INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO
Sales of £55m of London assets and £64m of regional assets provided funds, net of loan repayments, for £377m of acquisitions. Included 
in these acquisitions was the purchase of The Bower EC1, from the joint venture with Crosstree, where the existing cash equity and share of 
profits to date remained invested in the scheme. The acquisition was funded through new bank finance of £200m, of which £149.5m was 
drawn down to complete the purchase with the remaining facility available to fund the redevelopment of The T ower at 207 Old Street EC1. 
Revaluation surpluses of £53.5m (£0.3m attributable to our profit share partners) and £2.3m in our joint ventures contributed to an 
increase in the overall size of the investment portfolio on a see-through basis to £1,053m (2015: £790m).

DEBT AND FINANCIAL RISK
In seeking to finance Helical’s recent expansion, the Group has used a combination of new secured facilities, whose purpose and terms

The Group arranges its secured investment and development 
facilities to suit its business needs as follows:
•    In v es tment f acilities 
  We have £190m of revolving credit facilities which enable the 
group to acquire, refurbish, reposition and hold significant parts of 
our investment portfolio. We have used these facilities to finance 
our regional portfolio. Our London investment assets are primarily 
held in £380m of term loan secured facilities which, where 
appropriate, allow us to finance refurbishment projects. The 
value of the Group’s properties secured in these facilities at  
31 March 2016 was £945m (2015: £639m) with a corresponding 
loan to value of 54% (2015: 58%). The average maturity of the 
Group’s investment facilities at 31 March 2016 was 5.0 years 
(2015: 4.6 years) with a weighted average interest rate of 3.8% 
(2015: 3.7%). 
• Development facilities 
  These facilities finance the redevelopment of The Tower at  
The Bower, Old Street, London EC1 and the construction of the 
retirement villages at Durrants Village, Horsham; Maudslay Park, 
Great Alne; and Milbrook Village, Exeter. The average maturity 
of the Group’s development facilities at 31 March 2016 was  
4.0 years (2015: 2.0 years) with a weighted average interest rate 
of 5. 5% (2015: 3.7%).
• Joint venture facilities

In assessing the results of the Group for each financial year, Helical 
considers its interest cover as a measure of its performance and its 
ability to finance its annual interest payments from its net operating 
income, before revaluation gains or losses on the investment portfolio 
and net realisable provisions on the trading and development stock. 
In the year to 31 March 2016, this interest cover was 5.4 times 
(2015: 2.5 times).

Risk is an integral part of any group’s 
business activities and Helical’s ability to 
identify, assess, monitor and manage 
each risk to which it is exposed is 
fundamental to its financial stability, 
current and future financial performance 
and reputation. As well as seeing changes 
in our internal and external environment 
as potential risks, we also see them as 
being opportunities which can drive 
performance.
 
Risk management starts at Board level where the Directors set 
the overall risk appetite of the Group and the risk management 
strategies. Helical’s management runs the business within these 
guidelines and part of its role is to act within these strategies and 
to report to the Board on how they are being operated.
The Group’s risk appetite and risk management strategies are 
continually assessed by the Board to ensure that they are 
appropriate and consistent with the Group’s overall strategy and 
with external market conditions. The effectiveness of the Group’s 
risk management strategy is reviewed every six months by the 
Audit Committee and by the full Board.
The Board has ultimate responsibility for risk within the business. 
However, the small size of our team and our flat management 
structure allows the Executive Directors to have close contact 
with all aspects of the business and allows us to ensure that the 
identification and management of risks and opportunities is part 
of the mindset of all decision makers at Helical.
The principal risks faced by the Group, and the steps taken by the 
Group to mitigate these risks, are as follows:

PRINCIPAL RISKS REVIEW
VIABILITY STATEMENT 
The Directors have assessed the viability of the Group for a period 
of five years to March 2021, being the period for which the Board 
regularly reviews forecasts and which encompasses the lifetime of 
the Group’s major development projects. The Board does consider 
the future performance of the Group beyond the five years but a 
longer timeframe involves less certainty over the forecasting 
assumptions.
The viability of the Group is reviewed throughout the year and 
through multiple channels, detailed below:
•  The strategic direction of the Group is established by the Board 
once a year and is captured in the Business Plan which forms 
the basis of the detailed budgets and actions for the year;
•  The Board reviews the principal risks of the Group twice a year, 
reassessing the severity of each risk and determining the 
Group’s proposed response;
•  The five year forecasts for the Group are updated and reviewed 
by the Board on a quarterly basis; and
•  Management reviews the short term (three-four months) cash 
requirements of the Group on a weekly basis and cash balances 
and movements are monitored daily.
In making their assessment, the Board considers the principle risks 
and then assesses the potential impacts in severe, but plausible, 
downside scenarios together with the likely effectiveness of 
mitigating actions that the Group would have at its disposal. 
The most relevant risks and the potential impact of them on the 
viability of the Group are considered to be:
•  A significant reduction in the fair value of the Group’s property 
portfolio, which could result in the Group breaching loan covenants 
and being required to repay a proportion of borrowings;
•  A lack of demand from tenants as the Group’s development 
properties near practical completion, which could reduce the 
Group’s levels of rental income and profitability; and
•  An inability to maintain sufficient levels of rental income, which 
could present a short term liquidity risk for the Group.
The Group subjected the five year cashflow forecasts to sensitivity 
analysis in which it assessed the impact of significant reductions 
to the property portfolio fair value and associated rental income 
on the Group’s loan covenants. Management also modelled the 
rental income profile of the Group, taking into account expected 
changes to leases and contracted rents, comparing expected 
income over a five year period with the loan covenant requirements 
in order to determine points of potential pressure.
Based on the outcomes of the procedures outlined above and 
other matters considered by the Board, it has a reasonable 
expectation that the Group will be able to continue in operation 
and meet its liabilities as they fall due over the five year period of 
their assessment.

Helical implements responsible 
environmental and social practices 
across its direct business, via partners, 
contractors and suppliers and through 
its joint venture activities.
An endorsement of Helical’s commitment to managing 
environmental and social impacts is its continued listing in the 
FTSE4Good Index. The FTSE4Good Index measures the 
performance of companies that meet globally recognised 
corporate responsibility standards and facilitates investment in 
those companies. Maintaining listed status on this Index remains 
a key priority for Helical, and informs the evolving approach to 
Corporate Responsibility and sustainability. 
MANAGING CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY
Each year Helical reviews and updates its environmental 
management system, which has been in place since 2003. The 
environmental management system, which is available on the 
Company website, is embedded within the operations of Helical. 
Key elements of the system include:
•  ‘Environment’ and ‘Corporate Responsibility’ policies which set 
out the Group’s high-level commitment across a number of 
impact areas. These are reviewed annually at Board level and 
are implemented by the senior management team;
•  Annual (and ongoing) performance targets to enable Helical to 
focus its efforts throughout the year on measurable, yet achievable, 
performance goals. This year Helical has continued to report on 
energy and water consumption at the larger managed multi-let 
assets, and measured performance against quantitative targets 
set in 2015. In addition, the proportion of waste recycled has 
been measured at managed assets and Group owned 
developments projects;
•  Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) to help Helical monitor progress 
towards these targets and to ensure they are able to report in 
line with investor disclosure requirements, notably FTSE4Good. 
It should be acknowledged that the particular business model 
of the buying and selling of assets means that absolute performance 
measures can be difficult to compare year on year, hence this 
year the reporting against selected intensity (resource 
consumption) and like for like KPIs is being used;
•  Checklists to assist in applying minimum sustainability requirements 
across its development activities. Helical has developed a 
sustainability project management checklist to ensure that 
sustainability issues are incorporated into all decisions throughout 
the development lifecycle. In addition, an Environmental Impact 
Checklist is issued to individual contractors in order to address 
corporate goals at the construction stage; and
•  Effective use of internal audit and review through quarterly 
meetings of key Helical personnel, external corporate responsibility 
advisors and principal managing agents to ensure effective 
delivery of the objectives and targets.
The management system has been designed specifically to reflect 
the flexibility of Helical’s business model. It also reflects the key 
role that Helical’s partners play in delivering enhanced 
sustainability outcomes in all its business ventures, be they 
developments/refurbishments or in the management of individual 
multi-let assets.
REVIEW OF PROGRESS IN THE YEAR TO 31 MARCH 2016
The benefits of managing environmental and social impacts include 
increased ability to secure planning consent, improved marketability 
of assets to prospective tenants, reduced operating costs of assets, 
mitigating the risk of future legislation and regulation, and enhanced 
corporate reputation. We outline below the progress in relation to  
each of Helical’s Corporate Responsibility impact areas. 
ENVIRONMENT
The Group’s corporate commitments to environmental issues are 
outlined in the Group’s Environmental Policy which can be found 
on the Company website. The policy details Helical’s commitments 
across a range of impact areas and its development and property 
management activities. The Group set itself a number of targets 
to guide its Corporate Responsibility. These targets address a 
range of impacts arising from development and property 
management activities, including resource use and waste 
production, pollution, biodiversity, timber sourcing, tenant 
engagement, flood risk and sustainable design and construction. 
A full list of these targets can be found on the Group website. 
The performance against the key targets is summarised below:
•  Previously, year on year improvement targets have been reported 
for the Head Office. Following the relocation of the Head Office 
to 5 Hanover Square in August 2014, year on year data has been 
collated for energy. However, as the office is a serviced let 
property, waste and water consumption data are not available 
going forward;
•  The Group’s managed multi-let offices continue to improve 
energy and water efficiency through the implementation of low 
and no cost measures. The specific target for 2016 was to 
achieve a 2% improvement against the 2015 baseline. For this 
year, only those properties that can be compared on a like – 
for- like have been included: The Hub, Glasgow, Shepherds 
Building, London W14 and Churchgate and Lee House, 
Manchester. The Loom, London E1 and The Morgan Quarter , Cardiff, 
data cannot be compared year on year due to partial 
refurbishment taking place during 2015;
•  Of those that can be compared, Shepherds Building, London 
W14 has shown a drop in energy consumption of 18%, although 
this can be partially attributed to the closure of the café for part 
of the year. Water consumption increased by  
6% with the addition of new showers in the common parts.  
The Hub, Glasgow has shown a small decrease in electricity 
consumption and a 5% decrease in water consumption but a 
22% increase in gas consumption attributable to boiler down 
time in the prior year. Churchgate and Lee House, Manchester is 
difficult to assess in terms of year on year performance as there 
have been a number of issues with metering resulting in a large 
increase in electricity consumption. Gas consumption, however, 
has shown a 17% reduction; 
•  The Group’s retail portfolio has been reduced over the year with 
only The Morgan Quarter, Cardiff and Parkgate, Shirley retained 
to enable year on year comparison. Of these, The Morgan Quarter, 
Cardiff has shown a 13% decrease in electricity consumption 
through implementing a successful awareness raising programme 
for staff regarding the role they can play in reducing costs and 
lessening environmental impact. Parkgate, Shirley has shown a 
59% increase which is attributed to increased occupancy and  
a malfunctioning meter. With respect to water consumption 
year on year comparison is not possible at The Morgan Quarter, 
Cardiff due to the impact of the ongoing refurbishment work 
and at Parkgate, Shirley water consumption is not monitored;

CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY
•  The Group continues to offer recycling facilities at the larger of 
its managed assets. Where data is available Helical comfortably 
exceeded its ongoing target of a recycling rate of at least 35% 
at the majority of properties and achieved 80% at the Hub, 
Glasgow. The exceptions were Parkgate, Shirley and Churchgate 
and Lee House, Manchester which will be reviewed in the 
forthcoming year;
•  One of Helical’s ongoing targets is to proactively engage with 
tenants to encourage improvements in the efficient use of the 
buildings. Individual property managers have engaged with 
tenants to try to see if there are ways in which efficiency 
initiatives can be introduced and, particularly, to encourage 
increased recycling within the portfolio;
•  In compliance with legal requirements, the Group undertook an 
audit of its operations in accord with Energy Savings Opportunity 
Scheme (ESOS) and is currently implementing the key findings 
where potential payback savings have been identified. Given 
the nature of the portfolio, the focus of improvements is in the 
core managed multi-let buildings which have the largest energy 
consumption. Examples of the initiatives that are being pursued 
include a rolling programme of upgrading to LED lighting in The 
Hub, Glasgow and Shepherds Building, London W14 and a 
£75,000 capital spend on a new boiler system at The Hub, 
Glasgow; and
•  An ongoing objective is to improve the effectiveness of building 
management systems (BMS) and the use of smart meters. Of 
the larger multi-let buildings all have an operating BMS with the 
exception of The Loom, London E1.
Helical has maintained its registration with the Carbon Reduction 
Commitment Energy Efficiency Scheme (CRC). The confirmed 
purchased allowance for year to 31 March 2015 was 9,447 tonnes. 
The projected allowance for the year to 31 March 2016 is in the 
order of 7,974 tonnes based on the current reported emissions for 
the portfolio as a whole. The Group has again reported to the 
Carbon Disclosure Project in the year and achieved an improvement 
in its disclosure, scoring 86%, above the index average of 84%. In 
line with the mandatory requirement for reporting its greenhouse gas 
emissions, Helical has provided a separate disclosure in this report.
Helical presents its utility consumption performance for multi-let 
buildings under management as well as the Head Office (where 
data availability permits) below. As previously, the data provision 
focuses on energy consumption that is the responsibility of the 
landlord within common parts, vacant space and during 
refurbishment. Buildings that have been sold during the reporting 
year are not reported.

The suitability of the targets will be reviewed against the 
performance for the reporting year and revised accordingly to 
ensure that they remain challenging yet achievable.
The specific target set by Helical is to reduce energy consumption 
by 2% per annum in the principal managed assets. As discussed 
earlier in this section of the report, year on year performance is 
variable across the portfolio and complicated by the changing 
nature of the portfolio through acquisition and divestment, 
increasing occupancy and ongoing refurbishment of the 
component assets.
CONSTRUCTION SITE PERFORMANCE
As part of the ongoing refurbishment and development 
programme, a number of key performance indicators are also 
measured and recorded for the Group’s schemes above a 
£500,000 project value threshold. During the reporting year, this 
encompassed eighteen commercial and residential schemes and 
the performance is summarised below. 
BREEAM / Considerate Constructors Scheme (CCS)
In accordance with Helical’s corporate objectives, five out of the 
eligible six commercial developments are registered under the 
BREEAM scheme to meet a minimum of BREEAM Very Good. The 
Bower, Old Street London EC1, One Creechurch Place, London EC3, 
St Vincent Street, Glasgow and 23-28 Charterhouse Square, London 
EC1 have indicated that they are expecting to achieve an ‘Excellent’ 
rating. Of the twelve developments registered with CCS, all are 
above the minimum requirement for compliance and the majority 
are above the current industry average of 35.4/50 (for the year to 
March 2016), with four schemes scoring in excess of 40. 
Energy and water consumption
Eleven of the sites monitor purchased water and energy 
consumption and have set themselves reduction targets over the 
course of the project. The remaining seven developments report 
purchased water and energy use through the managed buildings 
data set.

A strong performance is shown by all sites that reported against 
the key performance indicator for sourcing sustainable timber. All 
sites which used timber sourced 100% from certified sustainable 
sources.
CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY HELICAL BAR PLC REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2016 66
CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY
Waste
Eleven out of eighteen developments have implemented a Site 
Waste Management Plan and the majority of these divert more 
than 85% of waste disposal from landfill, well in excess of the 
corporate target of 50% diversion from landfill. 
Biodiversity
Biodiversity improvement is included within Helical’s schemes 
where feasible and during the reporting period this applied to nine 
of the eighteen schemes. T o encourage biodiversity in urban areas, 
features such as green and brown roofs, bat boxes and bird boxes 
are included at C-Space, London EC1, The Bower Old Street, 
London EC1, One King Street, London W6, One Creechurch Place, 
London EC3 and St Vincent Street, Glasgow. Biodiversity 
improvement at the Durrants Retirement Village includes 
enhancing the wildlife area closest to the Mill Race, the provision of 
a bat house and the installation of additional bat boxes on retained 
trees. At Millbrook Retirement Village biodiversity enhancement 
includes the provision of a new otter holt and associated habitat, in 
addition to preserving the existing otter holt.
Sustainable travel 
The majority of the Group’s developments are within 650m of a 
bus service and/or within 1000m of a rail station and for the 
reporting year eleven developments include cycle provisions on 
site to maximise sustainable travel options. 
Climate change and flood risk
It is a Group objective to ensure that Sustainable Drainage 
Systems (SuDS) are included into the design to mitigate against 
flooding. Half of the developments assessed have incorporated 
SuDS where appropriate. 
Site management 
There have been no prosecutions or fines for environmental 
pollution incidents reported on the operational sites during the 
reporting period. Certified Environmental Management Systems 
(EMS) are implemented where appropriate to the size and capital 
value of the developments. This applied to two thirds of the 
projects during the reporting period.
GREENHOUSE GAS (GHG) EMISSIONS REPORTING
For the reporting year to 31 March 2016 the 2014 UK 
Government’s Conversion Factors for Company Reporting has 
been followed. Greenhouse gas emissions are reported using the 
following parameters to determine what is included within the 
reporting boundaries.
•  Scope 1 – direct emissions includes any gas data for landlord 
controlled parts and fuel use for Group owned vehicles. Fugitive 
emissions from air conditioning are included where it is Helical’s 
responsibility within the managed portfolio, providing the data 
is available. 
•  Scope 2 – indirect energy emissions includes purchased 
electricity throughout the Group operations within landlord 
controlled parts. Electricity used in refurbishment projects has 
been recorded separately where appropriate. In the majority of 
cases the electricity consumed is recorded for the individual 
properties as part of the data collection for the management of 
common parts, and contractors have been required to collect 
project specific data. 
The table below highlights that overall GHG emissions have 
decreased by 33% year on year. The reason for this is primarily 
due to selling a number of larger multi-let properties during the 
reporting period and the diversity of the portfolio. Data for last 
year has been restated due to metering and billing issues at a 
number of properties. For Scope 1 this represents a reduction of 
120 tonnes and for Scope 2 a reduction of 138 tonnes.
Due to the changing portfolio, only three multi-let office buildings 
and one shopping centre can report on carbon intensity. At 
Churchgate and Lee House, Manchester, The Hub, Glasgow and 
Shepherds Building, London W14 the average carbon intensity 
equates to 0.09 tCO2e/m2, whilst The Morgan Quarter, Cardiff 
has a carbon intensity of 0.02 tCO2e/m2. These levels are 
consistent with last year’s performance.
Greenhouse gas emissions (tonnes CO2e) are set out below for 
the year:
Year ended 
31 March 2015
tonnes
Year ended 
 31 March 2016

The specific target set by Helical is to reduce energy consumption 
by 2% per annum in the principal managed assets. As discussed 
earlier in this section of the report, year on year performance is

CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY
EMPLOYEES
As at 31 March 2016, Helical had 32 permanent and 3 temporary 
employees (8.5% of the staff), based at the Group’s head office in 
London. In addition, there were 5 employees in the Polish 
subsidiary and 48 full and part-time employees of the retirement 
village companies acquired in December 2015. The information set 
out below is in respect of the head office only. 
Gender diversity of the Board and the Company as at 31 March 
2016 is set out below:
Male Female
Board (including Non-Executive Directors) 92% 8%
Executives 56% 44%
All employees 47% 53%
 Helical continues to enforce its equal opportunities, harassment 
and sexual discrimination policies. We also continue to monitor 
compliance with its anti-bribery and whistle blowing policies. 
There have been no incidents to report against these policies to 
date.
 A high level of staff retention remains a key feature of the business. 
Helical has retained a highly skilled and experienced team and the 
table below shows a breakdown of staff by length of service:
T otal number 
of staff as at 
31 March 2016
Average 
length of 
service (years)
Executive directors 5 21.1
Executives 16 4.9
All employees 32 7.6
Helical’s staff retention levels not only reflect competitive 
remuneration and benefits packages but also its commitment to 
enhancing the professional and personal skills of its team by 
supporting employee training and development, by means of 
training courses, seminars and mentoring where appropriate. As 
in previous years, Helical continues to evaluate training needs in 
line with business objectives. There are no human rights issues of 
which the Board are aware that are considered relevant to the 
Group.
COMMUNITY AND SOCIAL INITIATIVES 
Helical takes a strong interest in community issues. Community 
engagement is an on-going concern throughout the development 
process, from planning until development completion and operation. 
The following examples from The Morgan Quarter, Cardiff 
demonstrate how community engagement has benefited the 
communities that we work with over the past year:
•  During November and December 2015, The Morgan Quarter, 
Cardiff ran Trading Places - a collaborative project between the 
Further Education Enterprise Hub and First Campus in partnership 
with The Morgan Quarter Cardiff, NatWest, EE and the Higher 
Education Enterprise Hub, which aims to develop entrepreneurial 
skills and attitudes through practical experiences among college 
students in South East Wales. The “Apprentice”-style challenge 
aimed to give students some real life enterprise and industry 
experience and offer an insight into the world of retail including 
exposure to essential business skills such as communication, 
negotiation and decision making. It culminated in a three day final 
with the winning applicants from each of the six participating 
colleges spending the first two days at the University of South 
Wales developing a sales strategy, sourcing products and 
designing their retail space. On the third day, with support and 
guidance from academics and industry experts, the students 
launched a pop up shop in The Morgan Quarter, Cardiff putting 
all of their knowledge and skills into practice; and
•  The Morgan Quarter, Cardiff also ran ‘Morgan Quarter Memories’ 
- a community-based project capturing the reminiscences of 
people who had been involved with the centre over the years to 
show what effect the scheme has had on people’s lives. 
Interviews with five people with particularly captivating stories 
were filmed by Liana Stewart, a Cardiff born and raised local 
film producer with strong local community links and her own 
special memories of the Morgan Arcades. The project attracted 
a wide ranging media response, including being featured on the 
local TV station Made in Cardiff. The success of the project was 
recognised by the winning of a Purple Apple Award.
 At the 2016 Cardiff Life Awards (the city’s most prestigious, high 
profile and sought after business awards), The Morgan Quarter, 
Cardiff was awarded a Special Recognition Award for its 
contribution to supporting independent business in Cardiff. Other 
community and social activities during the year included:
•  Helical’s continued membership of The Aldgate Partnership (TAP”), 
formed in 2014 to help drive a powerful agenda for change. 
Membership of the group currently includes landowners, 
commercial occupiers, and developers. TAP works in partnership 
with its members to develop Aldgate as ‘One Location’, 
delivering a range of interventions to support community 
development and develop a premier business hub with high 
quality public realm and environment that produces a safe, 
convenient and inspiring destination for all employees, residents 
and visitors.
CHARITABLE ACTIVITIES
During the year to 31 March 2016 Helical donated £36,300 to 
charities including LandAid, The Lord Mayor’s Appeal, Muscular 
Dystrophy UK and Great Ormond Street Hospital. The Group’s 
principal charitable activity is to raise money for LandAid (the 
official charity of the property industry) and a total of £11,420 was 
donated to LandAid during the year. In addition to this, £10,376 was 
raised during the annual LandAid day on 15 October, when a 
number of Helical Directors and staff, dressed as popular science 
fiction characters, toured the streets of Mayfair by pedibus and 
collected donations from fellow members of the property industry. 
Alongside the Group’s formal charitable activities, Helical employees 
fundraise for charities on a personal basis and, where appropriate, the 
Group will make donations to help the staff reach their fundraising goals. HELICAL BAR PLC REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2016 68
CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY
HEALTH & SAFETY
Helical has a corporate culture that is committed to the 
prevention of injuries and ill health to its employees or others that 
may be affected by its activities and the Group’s Health & Safety 
policy reflects this commitment. The Board of Directors and 
senior staff are responsible for implementing this policy and they 
look to ensure that health and safety considerations are always 
given priority in planning and in day-to-day activities. The Group’s 
Health & Safety Policy was last reviewed and updated in February 
2016 to reflect the latest legislative and regulatory developments. 
Training of Helical staff in the updated Health and Safety Policy 
and supporting CDM requirements has been undertaken during 
the reporting year. The Group’s Health & Safety policy can be 
found on the Company website and a summary of performance 
for the eighteen active sites is below.
Helical has delivered over two million man hours of construction 
during the year (an increase of 115% over the previous year) with 
no fatalities or major accidents and only 13 RIDDOR reportable 
incidents. Overall Health and Safety performance using Lost Time 
Accident Frequency Rate is a 29% improvement over last year. The 
majority of Helical projects are managed by principal contractors 
holding OHSAS 18001 certification and that maintain 100% 
Construction Skills Certification Scheme (CSCS) accreditation for 
all full time and subcontracted staff.
Only one RIDDOR incident occurred in the year across the 
managed portfolio.

SUPPLIERS
Fair treatment of suppliers remains a key priority for Helical and 
the Group’s policy is to settle all agreed liabilities within the terms 
established with suppliers. 
As required under the Modern Slavery Act, Helical will publish a 
statement later this year describing the steps taken during the year 
to prevent slavery and human trafficking within the Group’s supply 
chains and business. There will be a link to the statement on the 
homepage of the Company website.

CHAIRMAN’S REVIEW
Dear Shareholder,
This Annual Report reflects on a record year for Helical 
with pre-tax profits, shareholders’ funds and our total 
property portfolio at their highest level in the Company’s 
history as a real estate company.
The greatest proportion of this performance has come from our 
London portfolio, which now constitutes over 54% of our total 
portfolio. These results reflect a balance between a high yielding 
regional investment portfolio and a London investment and 
development programme providing both capital and rental 
growth.
COMPOSITION OF THE BOARD
As Chairman of the Nominations Committee, I have reported in 
detail on page 79 of this Annual Report regarding the present and 
proposed future constitution of your Board of Directors. 
Having been on the Board of Helical for over 30 years, the last 
four as Chairman, I intend to retire from the Board and will not be 
seeking re-election at this year’s Annual General Meeting (“AGM”). 
My fellow Non-Executive Director, Andy Gulliford, who has served 
on the Board for over 10 years will also retire from the Board at 
the same time. I would very much like to thank him for his expert 
advice and support to the Board over the years.
Chief Executive Officer (“CEO”), Mike Slade, joined the Board of 
Helical Bar plc in 1984, and has turned this previously small 
engineering company into a highly successful real estate 
company. He has led the Company for nearly 32 years and is the 
Company’s largest shareholder but has indicated that he wishes 
to step down as Chief Executive. I am, however, pleased that Mike 
has accepted the request of the Nominations Committee to 
continue his close involvement with the Group and to stand for 
election at the 2016 AGM as Non-Executive Chairman following 
my retirement. On behalf of the Board I would like to thank Mike 
for his outstanding contribution to the business during his long 
tenure as Chief Executive and am delighted that he will continue 
to be part of Helical’s future as Non-Executive Chairman.
Gerald Kaye, Development Director of the Company since 1994, will 
stand for election as Chief Executive of the Company at the AGM. 
Gerald has delivered many highly profitable schemes during his 
career with Helical which have played an integral part in delivering 
strong returns for the Company’s shareholders over the last 22 
years. Gerald is highly respected within the property industry and I 
am confident he will lead this Company with distinction. 
I share the Board’s view that the appointments of Gerald and Mike 
to their new roles are in the best interests of the Company and its 
shareholders.
Following the changes announced in November and as Mike Slade 
will not be regarded as an independent Chairman, the 
Nominations Committee engaged a firm of external consultants to 
carry out an extensive search for two new independent Non-
Executive Directors. The Committee wanted to appoint 
candidates with expertise in the property or financial sectors, who 
could challenge the Board effectively and who would complement 
the remaining independent Non-Executive Board members. I am 
extremely pleased that two exceptional candidates, Susan Clayton 
and Richard Cotton, were identified and subsequently appointed 
and I am confident that they will be valuable additions to the 
Board. Immediately following the AGM, the Board will consist of a 
Chairman, four Executive Directors and five independent 
Non-Executive Directors.
MAJOR DECISIONS
The Board meeting agendas during the year contained many 
issues including:
•  Consideration and approval of significant property acquisitions 
and disposals, most notably the acquisition of Crosstree’s 66.7 
per cent interest in The Bower, Old Street, London EC1;
•  A review of the Group’s corporate, property and financial 
strategy; and
• Changes to the composition of the Board as outlined above.
ANNUAL STRATEGY REVIEW 
In April 2016, the Board considered the Executive Directors 
Annual Strategy Review of the business examining the economic, 
geopolitical, societal and environmental risks affecting the 
business. This review reaffirmed the Company’s principal objective 
of combining investment and development activity to ensure 
maximum shareholder returns whilst managing risks appropriately. 
BOARD EVALUATION 
In order that we may implement our strategy successfully, the 
Board annually evaluates its own performance and that of its 
committees and Directors. This evaluation concluded that the 
Board and its committees continue to operate effectively. As 
Helical is currently not in the FTSE 350 the Code does not require 
the Company to undertake the Board evaluation process 
externally. However, for the year to 31 March 2017 the Board has 
committed to appoint an external consultant to conduct its Board 
evaluation process.
INVESTOR RELATIONS
We have an extensive programme of meetings and presentations 
with shareholders throughout the year with the majority of these 
taking place in the periods following our annual and half year 
results. Either the Chief Executive, Michael Slade or the CEO 
Designate, Gerald Kaye, and the Finance Director, Tim Murphy, 
attend the majority of meetings with the remaining Executive 
Directors, Duncan Walker and Matthew Bonning-Snook, also 
attending as appropriate. 
The Senior Independent Director, Richard Gillingwater, and I are 
available to meet shareholders if they wish to discuss any matters 
with us.
It has been a privilege to serve on this exceptional Company’s 
Board for 30 years and to be Chairman for 4 years. I shall be sad 
to relinquish my association with such a dynamic and successful 
team of people after so long. However, I believe that the Company, 
the executives and the portfolio of developments and investment 
properties are poised for a successful future. This success should 
be further enhanced by a new Chairman, new Chief Executive and 
a refreshed Board.
The following pages describe in greater detail our governance 
structure and the work of the Board and its Committees.
Nigel McNair Scott 
Chairman

ONE BARTHOLOMEW CLOSE, LONDON EC1 HELICAL BAR PLC REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2016 72
The Board of Helical is collectively responsible for providing 
the leadership of the Company within a framework of controls 
and reporting structures which assist in pursuing its strategic 
aims and business objectives. Following the 2016 AGM, it 
will comprise the Chairman, the Chief Executive, five 
Non-Executive Directors and three Executive Directors. The 
Board delegates operational responsibilities to an 
Executive Committee and governance responsibilities to 
Nominations, Audit, Remuneration and Valuations 
Committees whilst retaining overall responsibility for the 
running of the Company.
LEADERSHIP 
Following the proposed changes to the Board noted above and 
subject to shareholder support for all of the Directors standing for 
election or re-election at the 2016 AGM, the Chairman of the 
Company will be Michael Slade. The Chief Executive will be Gerald 
Kaye and the three Executive Directors will be Matthew Bonning-
Snook, Tim Murphy (Finance Director) and Duncan Walker. The 
Non-Executive Directors will be Richard Gillingwater (Senior 
Independent Director), Susan Clayton, Richard Cotton, Richard 
Grant and Michael O’Donnell. All the current Directors, except for 
Nigel McNair Scott and Andy Gulliford, who intend to retire from 
the Board, will offer themselves for election or re-election at the 
2016 AGM. 
Biographies of all Directors and details of their shareholdings in 
the Company are on pages 74 to 75 and 102 respectively.
ROLES OF CHAIRMAN AND CHIEF EXECUTIVE
The Chairman and the Chief Executive are responsible for the 
leadership of the Company. The Chairman’s primary responsibility 
is to lead the Board and ensure its effectiveness, whilst the Chief 
Executive is responsible for running the Company’s business. The 
division of responsibilities is clearly established at Helical, is set 
out in writing and is approved by the Board.
BOARD RESPONSIBILITIES
The main purpose of the Board is to create and deliver the long 
term success of the Group and returns for its shareholders. The 
Board is collectively responsible for providing the entrepreneurial 
leadership of the Group within a framework of controls and 
reporting structures which assist the Group in pursuing its strategic 
aims and business objectives. The Board sets the Group’s strategic 
aims, ensures that the necessary financial and human resources 
are in place for the Group to meet its objectives and also reviews 
management performance. The Board sets the Group’s values and 
standards and ensures that the Group’s obligations to its 
shareholders and others are understood and met.
All Directors take decisions objectively in the interests of the 
Group. As part of their roles as members of the Board, Non-
Executive Directors constructively challenge and help develop 
proposals on strategy and the risk appetite of the Group. 
Non-Executive Directors scrutinise the performance of 
management in meeting agreed goals and objectives and monitor 
the reporting of performance. They satisfy themselves on the 
integrity of financial information and that financial controls and 
systems of risk management are robust and defensible. They are 
responsible for determining appropriate levels of remuneration of 
the Executive Directors and have a prime role in appointing and, 
where necessary, removing Executive Directors. In conjunction 
with the Nominations Committee, the Board considers succession 
planning of Board members and senior management. In addition 
to Boardroom discussions, the Chairman maintains contact with 
other Non-Executive Directors by telephone and at least annually, 
will hold meetings with the Non-Executive Directors without the 
Executive Directors present. Richard Gillingwater (Senior 
Independent Director) holds meetings of the independent 
Non-Executive Directors separately from the rest of the Board at 
least once a year to ensure that any issues may be discussed 
without the presence of a non-independent Director.
The Board has a schedule of matters specifically reserved to it for 
decision. The Board controls the business but delegates day-to-day 
responsibility to the executive management. An Executive Committee, 
comprising all the Executive Directors, meets regularly to discuss 
the development of strategy, to review and implement proposed 
transactions, to review policies and procedures (including health and 
safety), to monitor budget and financial performance and to assess 
risk. The full Board reviews all minutes of proceedings at Executive 
Committee meetings and receives reports from the Executive 
Committee Chairman at every Board meeting.

GOVERNANCE REVIEW
At Helical we believe that robust corporate governance is 
of fundamental importance in delivering for shareholders 
the long-term success of the Company through the 
effective, entrepreneurial and prudent management of the 
Company. The Board of Helical is collectively responsible 
for providing the leadership of the Company within a 
framework of controls and reporting structures which assist 
in pursuing its strategic aims and business objectives. 
THE UK CORPORATE GOVERNANCE CODE 2014 
(THE “CODE”)
The Board is accountable to the Group’s shareholders for good 
corporate governance and we believe in applying the highest 
principles of corporate governance. We have complied 
throughout the year with the principles as set out in the section of 
the Code headed “The Main Principles of the Code”. The Group 
also takes into account the corporate governance guidelines of 
institutional shareholders and their representative bodies.
INDUCTION OF NEW DIRECTORS
Following their appointments, Susan Clayton and Richard Cotton 
received a comprehensive induction, which included visits to 
properties and meetings with the Company’s senior managers. 
COMPOSITION OF THE BOARD
The Code requires a Board and its committees to have an 
appropriate balance of skills, experience, independence and 
knowledge of the Company to enable them to discharge their 
duties and responsibilities effectively. Helical operates with a 
strong management team of senior decision makers backed up by 
a finance team and other support staff. The Group is keen to 
promote exceptional talent to Board level at the earliest 
opportunity to expose such individuals to the broader issues 
facing the business, encourage their long term commitment to the 
Group and to provide for future succession. 
Provision B.1.2 of the Code notes that companies such as Helical, 
which are below the FTSE350, are required to have at least two 
independent Non-Executive Directors. Following the proposed 
change to the Board at the 2016 AGM, the Board will comprise the 
Chairman, four Executive Directors and five independent 
Non-Executive Directors. The independent Non-Executive 
Directors will be Susan Clayton, Richard Cotton. Richard 
Gillingwater, Richard Grant and Michael O’Donnell,
In the Board’s view, the composition of the Board has an 
appropriate balance of skills, experience, independence and 
knowledge of the Company as required by the Code.
ANNUAL EVALUATION OF THE BOARD AND ITS 
COMMITTEES
During the year the Board undertook a formal evaluation process, 
led by the Senior Independent Director, which involved each 
director submitting an appraisal in respect of the performance of 
the main Board, its committees and Directors, including the 
Chairman. The Senior Independent Director reported the results 
of that evaluation process to the Board. The process reviewed 
criteria including real estate matters, Board composition and 
Board and Committee processes. There were no significant areas 
of concern raised by the Directors and any points raised have 
been dealt with appropriately.
Since the Company is not in the FTSE350 and as permitted by the 
Code, it does not currently use external consultants to undertake 
its evaluation process. However, following the changes to the 
Board, it is proposed that the 2017 Board Evaluation will be 
carried out externally. 
DIRECTORS – INFORMATION AND PROFESSIONAL 
DEVELOPMENT
The Board is supplied in a timely manner with information in a 
form and of a quality appropriate to enable it to discharge its 
duties and its Directors are free to seek any further information 
they consider necessary. The Directors have access to the services 
of a Company Secretary who is responsible for advising the Board 
on all governance matters and ensuring compliance with Board 
procedures and applicable laws and regulations. under the 
direction of the Chairman, the Company Secretary’s 
responsibilities include ensuring good information flows within the 
Board and its Committees and between senior management and 
Non-Executive Directors, as well as facilitating induction of new 
Directors and assisting with professional development as required. 
The Board ensures that Directors have access to independent 
professional advice at the Group’s expense where they judge it 
necessary to discharge their responsibilities as directors. Training 
is available for all directors as necessary. 
NOMINATIONS COMMITTEE
The report of the Nominations Committee, which describes the 
work of the Committee, is on pages 79 and 80.  HELICAL BAR PLC REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2016 77 GOVERNANCE
GOvERNANCE REvIEW
 
AUDIT COMMITTEE
The Audit Committee Chairman is Richard Grant, the Finance 
Director of Cadogan Estates Limited and a former partner of 
PWC. As a result, the Board considers that he has recent and 
relevant financial experience as required by the Code. The report 
of the Chairman of the Audit Committee describing the issues 
considered by the Committee in the year under review is on 
pages 81 and 82. 
RISK MANAGEMENT AND INTERNAL CONTROLS
The Board is responsible for maintaining a sound system of 
internal control to safeguard shareholders’ investment and the 
Group’s assets. Such a system is designed to manage, but cannot 
eliminate, the risk of failure to achieve business objectives. There 
are inherent limitations in any control system and, accordingly, 
even the most effective system can provide only reasonable, and 
not absolute, assurance against material misstatement or loss.
The key features of the Group’s system of internal control are as 
follows:
•  Clearly defined organisational responsibilities and limits of 
authority. The day-to-day involvement of the Executive 
Directors in the running of the business ensures that these 
responsibilities and limits are adhered to;
• Financial controls and review procedures;
•  Financial information systems including cash flow, profit and 
capital expenditure forecasts. The Board receives regular and 
comprehensive reports on the day-to-day running of the 
business;
•  An Audit Committee which meets with the auditors and deals with 
any significant internal control matters. In the year under review the 
Audit Committee met with the auditors on two occasions; and
•  The Board is responsible for the management of the Group’s 
risk profile which is reviewed by the Audit Committee during 
the year. An analysis of the Group’s principal risks can be found 
on pages 58 to 61.
INTERNAL AUDIT
The Board reviewed its position for the year to 31 March 2016 and 
reaffirmed its stance that in view of the relatively small size of the 
Group it does not consider an internal audit function would 
provide any significant additional assistance in maintaining a 
system of internal controls.
GOING CONCERN
The Directors have reviewed the current and projected financial 
position of the Group making reasonable assumptions about 
future trading performance.
The key areas of sensitivity are:
• Timing and value of property sales;
• Availability of loan finance and related cash flows;
•  Future property valuations and their impact on covenants 
and potential loan repayments;
• Committed future expenditure;
• Future rental income; and
• Receipt, amount and timings of development profits.
The forecast cash flows have been sensitised to reflect those cash 
inflows which are less certain and to take account of a potential 
deterioration of property valuations. In addition, the forecasts have 
been subject to sensitivity analysis in which the impact of significant 
reductions to the property portfolio fair value and associated rental 
income on the Group’s loan covenants was assessed. From their 
review, the Directors believe that the Group has adequate resources 
to continue to be operational as a going concern for the foreseeable 
future.
ATTENDANCE AT BOARD AND COMMITTEE 
MEETINGS DURING THE YEAR
Six scheduled meetings of the Board were held during the year 
ended 31 March 2016. In addition, several unscheduled meetings 
were arranged to discuss particular transactions and events. On 
occasions, Directors who are not members of the Committees 
attend at the invitation of the Committee Chairman. The attendance

NOTICE OF ANNUAL GENERAL MEETING
The Code recommends that the Notice of AGM and related 
papers be sent to shareholders at least 20 working days before 
the meeting. For the 2015 AGM the Notice and related papers 
were sent out 22 working days before the AGM. 
ENGAGEMENT WITH SHAREHOLDERS
The Directors value the views of the Company’s shareholders and 
recognise their interest in the Group’s strategy and performance, 
Board membership and quality of management. They hold regular 
meetings with, and give presentations to, the Company’s institutional 
shareholders to discuss the Group’s results and objectives. The 
directors regularly meet, with the help of the Company’s brokers, 
institutions that do not currently hold shares in the Group to 
inform them of the Company’s objectives. Michael Slade, as Chief 
Executive or Gerald Kaye as CEO Designate have attended most 
of the meetings during the year and they are usually accompanied 
by at least one of the other executive directors. 
During the year under review Nigel McNair Scott, Chairman, and 
Richard Gillingwater, Senior independent Director, engaged with 
principal investors (holding more than 3% of the Company’s shares) 
and shareholder representative bodies to discuss the proposed 
Board changes intended to take effect at the 2016 AGM.
Michael O’Donnell, Chairman of the Remuneration Committee, also 
engaged with Helical’s principal shareholders and shareholder 
representative bodies to discuss the conclusions of a review of the 
Company’s Remuneration Policy. 
The Senior Independent Director, Richard Gillingwater, was 
available to meet with shareholders throughout the year under 
review and will hold meetings with shareholders whenever 
requested in order to ensure sufficient understanding of any 
issues and concerns they may have. 
The AGM is used to communicate with investors and they are 
encouraged to participate. The Chairman, Senior Independent 
Director and members of the Audit, Remuneration and Nominations 
Committees will attend the AGM and will be available to answer 
questions. Separate resolutions are proposed on each issue in order 
that they can be given proper consideration and there is a separate 
resolution to consider the annual report and accounts. All proxy 
votes are counted and the level of proxies lodged on each resolution 
will be indicated after it has been dealt with by a show of hands.
The directors receive regular reports from sector analysts and 
investor relations advisors on how the Group is viewed by its 
shareholders. The Group communicates with all shareholders 
through the issue of regular press releases and through its 
website at www.helical.co.uk.

NOMINATIONS COMMITTEE 
REPORT
Dear Shareholder,
In accordance with the UK Corporate Governance Code, 
the role of the Nominations Committee, and my primary 
responsibility as its Chairman, is to ensure that the 
Company is headed by an effective Board which is 
collectively responsible for the long-term success of the 
Company. This is best achieved through the provision of 
entrepreneurial leadership and a talented executive team, 
supported by committees with an appropriate balance of 
skills, experience, independence and knowledge of the 
Company to be able to constructively challenge and assist 
the executive team in achieving its objectives. Alongside me, 
the Committee comprises Susan Clayton, Richard Cotton 
Richard Gillingwater, Richard Grant and Michael O’Donnell.
The terms of reference of the Nominations Committee, which 
were reviewed during the year, are available on request and 
are included on the Group’s website at www.helical.co.uk.
CHANGES TO THE BOARD
Our principal area of focus during the year was succession 
planning for the Board. On 26 November 2015 the Company 
announced the Board changes planned, subject to shareholder 
approval, to take effect at the 2016 Annual General Meeting 
(“AGM”). Gerald Kaye, Development Director and a member of the 
Board since 1994, is standing for election as Chief Executive. I 
intend to stand down from the Board at the 2016 AGM and Mike 
Slade, current Chief Executive is standing for election as my 
successor as Non-Executive Chairman.
These decisions were taken after careful consideration by the 
Committee and with independent external professional advice 
regarding what is in the best long term interests of the Company 
and its shareholders. 
We retained Sam Allen Associates, who have done extensive work 
in the FTSE 250 conducting both Executive and Non-Executive 
searches, and advising on CEO and Chair succession. With the 
assistance of Sam Allen Associates, and having considered the 
options of both external and internal candidates for the position 
of Chief Executive, it became clear that Helical’s senior 
management team offered the strongest possible candidates. 
After a thorough process, the Committee proposed Gerald Kaye 
as the new Chief Executive.
Gerald’s 22 year career with Helical has seen him deliver substantial 
realised profits for shareholders, often with little or no equity 
contribution from the Company. He has all the skills needed to 
head the Company in the next phase of its growth. Most recently 
he has been responsible for the developments at Barts Square 
EC1 and The Bower EC1, two major mixed use London schemes.
With regard to my replacement as Non-Executive Chairman,  
we again used Sam Allen Associates who carried out another 
benchmarking exercise, against a full job specification and list  
of required attributes. The Committee assessed both internal and 
external candidates for the Non-Executive Chairman role, considering 
individuals across the property industry and from a wider financial 
and uK industry background. ultimately, we believed that Mike Slade 
would offer the Company the best possible level of experience, 
access to important relationships and knowledge of property 
markets and understanding of the culture of Helical Bar, as well as 
a degree of continuity which is important during a time of change.
Whilst considering the Non-Executive Chairman appointment, the 
Board was fully mindful of the uK Corporate Governance Code’s 
recommendation for a new Chairman to be independent upon 
appointment. In light of this the Committee conducted an extensive 
consultation exercise with the Company’s largest investors and 
representative bodies, to explain the reasons for the changes. The 
Committee is confident that Mike Slade is the most appropriate 
candidate for this role. In discharging the role of Non-Executive 
Chairman, he will be assisted by five independent Non-Executive 
directors, from whom the next Chairman of the Company is 
expected to be identified.
Andy Gulliford, who has been a Non-Executive Director of the 
Company since 2006, has informed the Committee that he will 
not be offering himself for re-appointment at the 2016 AGM. 
On behalf of the Board, I congratulate Mike for his outstanding 
contribution to the business during his long tenure, and at the 
same time thank Andy for his expert advice and support over the 
years.
The appointments of Susan Clayton and Richard Cotton as 
additional Non-Executive Directors on 1 February and 1 March 
2016 respectively met our aim of bringing further independence 
and balance to the Board. Executive Search Consultants, Norman 
Broadbent were appointed to advise on the search for two new 
independent Non-Executive Directors. Their brief was to identify 
potential candidates with a background in the real estate sector 
or the financial sector. Having met with a number of strong 
candidates, the Committee was pleased to appoint Susan Clayton 
on 1 February 2016 and Richard Cotton on 1 March 2016. Both Susan 
and Richard were appointed as members of the Nominations, 
Audit and Remuneration Committees. In addition, Susan was 
appointed Chairman of the valuation Committee. Susan has an 
impressive track record in the real estate sector and Richard has  
a strong corporate finance and real estate background. The Board 
looks forward to benefitting from their considerable experience 
and fresh perspectives in the years to come.
Appointments to the Board and its Committees are made against 
objective criteria. Care is taken to ensure that appointees have 
enough time available to devote to the job. The Committee controls 
the process for Board appointments and makes recommendations 
to the Board. The Board is mindful of the Group’s diversity policy 
and the Committee gives full consideration to diversity, including 
gender diversity, when recommending to the Board any future 
Board appointments. All Board appointments are be based on 
experience and will be made on merit. HELICAL BAR PLC REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2016 80
NOMINATIONS COMMITTEE REPORT
ANNUAL GENERAL MEETING
The Board believes that the requirements of Code Provision B.7.1 
of the uK Corporate Governance Code should be fulfilled. This 
provision requires all directors of FTSE350 companies to be 
subject to annual re-election by shareholders. Whilst the Company 
is not in the FTSE350, the Board has chosen to comply with this 
provision as it accepts that shareholders should annually have the 
right to vote on each Director’s election or re-election to the Board. 
At the Annual General Meeting to be held on 25 July 2016, the 
following resolutions relating to the appointment of Directors are 
being proposed: 
•  The election of Mike Slade as Non-Executive Chairman;
•  The election of Gerald Kaye as Chief Executive Officer;
•  The re-election, as Executive Directors, of Tim Murphy, Matthew 
Bonning-Snook and Duncan Walker; 
•  The election of Susan Clayton, who was appointed by the Board 
as a Non-Executive Director on 1 February 2016;
•  The election of Richard Cotton, who was appointed by the 
Board as a Non-Executive Director on 1 March 2016; and
•  The re-election, as Non-Executive Directors, of Richard 
Gillingwater, Richard Grant and Michael O’Donnell.

Nigel McNair Scott
Chairman of the Nominations Committee
15 June 2016 HELICAL BAR PLC REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2016 81 GOVERNANCE
Dear Shareholder,
I chair the Audit Committee and the other members are 
Susan Clayton, Richard Cotton, Richard Gillingwater and 
Michael O’Donnell. Further details of these Directors may 
be found on pages 74 and 75. None of the Committee 
members have any personal or financial interests in the 
matters to be decided (other than as shareholders), potential 
conflicts of interest arising from cross-directorships, or any 
day-to-day involvement in running the business. 
The Committee endorses the principles set out in the FRC 
Guidance on Audit Committees. The Board has formal and 
transparent arrangements for considering how it applies the 
Group’s financial reporting and internal control principles and for 
maintaining an appropriate relationship with its auditors. Whilst all 
directors have a duty to act in the interests of the Group, this 
Committee has a particular role, acting independently from the 
Executive Directors, to ensure that the interests of shareholders 
are properly protected in relation to financial reporting and 
internal control. Appointments to the Committee are made by the 
Board on the recommendation of the Nominations Committee in 
consultation with the Audit Committee Chairman.
The terms of reference of the Audit Committee, which were 
reviewed during the year, are available on request and are 
included on the Company’s website at www.helical.co.uk.
THE WORK OF THE AUDIT COMMITTEE IN THE YEAR
The Committee met five times during the year and a record of 
attendance at these meetings is shown on page 77. It is common 
practice at Helical for Audit Committee meetings to be attended 
by all Board members who are available, whether or not they are 
members of the Committee, so that their contribution to the 
matters discussed may be obtained.
In conjunction with the Board, the Audit Committee reviewed the 
following matters during the year:
• Review of risk and internal controls;
•  The financial statements of the Group and the announcement 
of the annual results to 31 March 2015 and the interim statement 
on the half year results to 30 September 2015; 
• The re-appointment of the Group’s external auditor; and
•  The external auditors’ independence and the provision of 
non-audit services by the external auditor.
The Audit Committee met the external auditor on two occasions 
to discuss matters arising from the annual and interim audits.
Other matters formally reviewed and discussed by the Committee 
during the year included:
•  Review of various company policies including those relating to 
anti-bribery, share dealing and whistleblowing; and
•  Review of the Group’s need for an internal audit function and 
issues related to IT risk and business continuity planning.
In discharging its responsibilities in connection with the 
preparation of the financial statements for the year to 31 March 
2016, the Committee is responsible for reviewing the 
appropriateness of the Group’s accounting policies, assumptions, 
judgements and estimates as applied by the executive 
management to the financial statements. During this review the 
following significant issues were considered:
• Internal controls
  The Committee annually reviews the need for an internal audit 
function and recently reaffirmed its stance that, in view of the 
close involvement of the Executive Directors in the running of 
the Group and the scale and complexity of the business, it does 
not consider that an internal audit function is required. However, 
periodically, the Committee asks the Group’s auditors to review 
its internal controls and their most recent report was presented 
to the Committee in April 2015. Grant Thornton’s ‘Report on the 
Design and Operating Effectiveness of Internal Controls of 
Helical Bar plc’ provided a review of the Group’s control 
environment and internal controls. This report did not highlight 
any material weaknesses in the design and effectiveness of the 
Group’s systems and controls. Its key recommendations, where 
appropriate, have been introduced during the year;
• Valuation 
  The valuation of the Group’s investment and trading and 
development portfolio is a key area of judgement in preparing 
the annual and half yearly financial statements and reports. For 
this reason the fair value of the Group’s investment portfolio is 
determined by independent third party experts who are familiar 
with the markets in which the Group operates and have suitable 
professional qualifications.
  The Group’s trading and development stock is accounted for in 
the financial statements at the lower of cost and net realisable 
value. Accordingly, the Committee reviews the assumptions 
made in considering whether an asset should be written down 
to its net realisable value, if lower than cost. In addition, the 
Committee reviews those instances where stock is considered 
to have a fair value above its current book value. The surplus of 
fair value above book value is not included in the Group’s 
Balance Sheets, nor is any movement reflected in the Income 
Statement. However, in accordance with the best practice 
recommendations of the European Public Real Estate 
Association, the surplus is included in the calculation of the 
EPRA Net Asset value per share at each reporting date. The fair 
value calculation of the trading and development stock is 
reviewed by a suitably qualified independent third party valuer. 
  In addition, the fair values of the investment, trading and 
development property portfolios are reviewed and approved by 
the valuations Committee which is chaired by Susan Clayton, 
FRICS, an independent Non-Executive Director.
• Revenue Recognition
  Revenue recognition is a presumed significant risk under 
International Standard on Auditing (uK and Ireland) and where 
the Group enters into complex transactions, judgment must be 
applied in determining when, and to what extent, revenue 
should be recognised. For material transactions technical 
papers are presented to the Committee by Management and 
the Committee also requests that the Group’s external auditors 
review and report on these judgments.
  The Committee assesses the appropriateness of the proposed 
revenue recognition for each transaction and these are 
discussed between the external auditor and Richard Grant, ACA 
and independent Non-Executive Chairman of the Audit 
Committee.
In addition to the significant issues discussed above, the 
Committee also considered the Group’s ability to continue as a 
going concern and the estimates and judgements discussed in 
note 38 to these accounts.
AUDIT COMMITTEE REPORT HELICAL BAR PLC REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2016 82
AuDIT COMMITTEE REPORT
 
EFFECTIVENESS OF THE EXTERNAL AUDITOR
During the year, the Audit Committee reviewed Grant Thornton 
uK LLP’s fees, effectiveness and whether the agreed audit plan 
had been fulfilled and the reasons for any variation from the plan. 
The Audit Committee also considered their robustness and the 
degree to which they were able to assess key accounting and 
audit judgements and the content of their reports. This was 
performed through reviewing their reports and meeting with 
them to discuss their audit approach and findings. The Audit 
Committee concluded that both the audit and the audit process 
were effective.
AUDIT INDEPENDENCE
The Audit Committee considers the external auditor to be 
independent. The Audit Committee has noted the rules on 
mandatory audit firm rotation contained in the Eu Audit 
Regulation and the requirements under the uK Corporate 
Governance Code. Mandatory auditor rotation is not required until 
after the reporting year ended 31 March 2020. Grant Thornton uK 
LLP has been the auditor of the Group for longer than ten years 
and there has been no audit tender during this time. However, the 
Committee will continue to monitor the effectiveness of the 
external auditor and will act in accordance with the Eu regulations 
and the Code as appropriate.
The Group’s policy on awarding non-audit work to its auditor is 
designed to ensure that the Group receives the most appropriate 
advice without compromising the independence of the auditor. A 
policy of reviewing audit independence has been adopted whereby 
non-audit services undertaken by the auditor are approved prior 
to work being carried out. Fees for non-audit work cannot exceed 
£20,000 without the appointment being approved by the Audit 
Committee. During the year, non-audit fees of £39,000 were paid 
to Grant Thornton uK LLP for advisory services in relation to the 
Group’s Polish operations. This work was carried out by a team 
separate to the audit team and the work was not relied on by the 
audit team in reaching their opinion.
ANNUAL GENERAL MEETING 
At the Annual General Meeting to be held on 25 July 2016 the 
following resolutions relating to the auditor are being proposed: 
•  The re-appointment of Grant Thornton uK LLP as Independent 
Auditor; and
•  To authorise the Directors to set the remuneration of the 
Independent Auditor.
I hope that shareholders will support the Committee and vote 
in favour of these resolutions.

Dear Shareholder
I am pleased to present the Remuneration Committee’s Report 
on directors’ remuneration for the year to 31 March 2016. 
This report has been approved by the Board of Helical Bar plc. 
COMMITTEE MEMBERS
Michael O’Donnell (Chairman)
Susan Clayton
Richard Cotton
Richard Gillingwater
Richard Grant
The main duty of the Remuneration Committee (“Committee”) is 
to determine and agree with the Board, the framework or broad 
policy for the remuneration of the Chairman and the Executive 
Directors and, subject to proposals being submitted by the Chief 
Executive, recommend and monitor the level and structure of 
remuneration for such other members of the executive management 
that report directly to the Chief Executive. The remuneration of 
Non-Executive Directors is a matter for the Chairman and the 
executive members of the Board. 
This Directors’ Remuneration Report has been divided into the 
following three sections:
• This Annual Statement;
•  Remuneration Policy Report, which sets out the Group’s policy on 
the remuneration of Executive and Non-Executive Directors; and,
•  Annual Report on Remuneration, which discloses how the 
remuneration policy was implemented in the year ended 31 
March 2016 and how the policy will be operated in the year 
ending 31 March 2017.
As discussed in the Chairmans Review on page 71, there are 
changes to the Board to be implemented at the Company’s AGM 
on 25 July 2016 when the current Chief Executive, Michael Slade, 
is to step down from the role and off er himself for election as 
Non-Executive Chairman of the Company. Gerald Kaye, currently 
an Executive Director responsible for the Group’s major development 
projects, will stand for election as Chief Executive of the Company. 
The current Chairman, Nigel McNair Scott, and Non-Executive 
Director, Andy Gulliford, are to retire at the AGM. 
In addition to these Board changes, the Executive Bonus Plan 2011 
reached the end of its shareholder approved life on 31 March 2016. As 
a consequence, the Committee resolved to review and simplify its 
remuneration policy and has consulted major shareholders and 
representative bodies. Following the completion of the consultation 
process and noting the constructive and pragmatic responses of 
investors consulted, the Company will be seeking shareholder 
approval at the 2016 AGM for a new Remuneration Policy which 
will include an amended Annual Bonus Scheme 2012 (to be 
renamed Annual Bonus Scheme 2016) for all Executive Directors.
The proposed changes to the Annual Bonus Scheme 2012 include 
signifi cant concessions from its Executive Director participants.
PERFORMANCE AND REWARD 
IN THE YEAR TO 31 MARCH 2016 
As noted in the Strategic Report on pages 1 to 68, the Group has 
delivered an increase in EPRA net assets per share of 19.7% (2015: 
23.0%) in the year under review with a CAGR over the three years 
to 31 March 2016 of 20.4% (2015: 15.5%). The Group’s total 
portfolio return, as reported by IPD was 21.7% (2015: 20.4%). 
Pre-tax profi ts of the Group, before performance related awards, 
were £135m (2015: £104m).

2016
Subsequent to the year end, and in accordance with the rules of 
the Executive Bonus Plan 2011 and the Helical Bar Annual Bonus 
Scheme 2012, cash and deferred shares have been approved for 
inclusion in the fi nancial statements for the year to 31 March 2016. 
Details of these annual bonus awards are disclosed in the Annual 
Report on Remuneration.
Awards made in 2013 under the terms of the 2004 Performance 
Share Plan (“PSP”) were subject to two performance conditions 
over the three years to 31 March 2016. Two thirds of the awards 
were based on absolute net asset value performance. The remaining 
third of the awards were based on a comparison of the Group’s 
portfolio return to the IPD Total Return index. The performance 
criteria were measured at the end of the three year period and 
100% of the awards are expected to vest.
The Committee believes that the provision for annual cash and 
deferred share bonuses and the expected vesting of the 2013 PSP 
award in respect of the three-year performance period ended 31 
March 2016 accurately and fairly represents the reward determined 
by the Group’s remuneration schemes based on the performance 
of the Group over the respective performance periods.
DIRECTORS’ 
REMUNERA TION REPORT
ANNUAL STATEMENT HELICAL BAR PLC REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2016 84
DIRECTORS’ REMuNERATION REPORT
ANNuAL STATEMENT
SUMMARY OF THE PROPOSED CHANGES 
In light of the reshaping of the Board and the Executive Bonus 
Plan 2011 reaching the end of its shareholder approved life, the 
Committee undertook to review the Company’s remuneration 
policy to reflect these changes. In conducting its review, the 
Committee restated its overall policy with regard to Executive 
Directors’ remuneration as follows:
•  Maintaining fixed remuneration packages below the median 
level of its peers; and
•  Aligning variable incentive based bonus and share schemes 
with the long term success of the Company and the interests of 
its shareholders.
Recognising the reduction in the number of Executive Directors 
and the current sensitivities surrounding executive pay quantum 
and transparency in the external environment, the Committee has 
sought to reduce the total quantum of variable pay, introduce 
additional, and strengthen existing, shareholder protections and 
simplify the bonus scheme calculations whilst continuing to 
operate bonus arrangements which incentivise the Executive 
Directors. The main changes to the remuneration policy are as 
follows:
•  On becoming Chairman, Mike Slade will receive an annual fee of 
£155,000, plus an additional benefit in kind of £20,000 for use 
of secretarial support for non-business use, to reflect his 
Non-Executive Director role. He ceased accruing bonus from 1 
April 2016 and is no longer entitled to receive PSP awards. 
Outstanding PSP awards will continue to vest on the normal 
vesting dates subject to continued service and performance 
targets in line with the PSP rules approved by shareholders;
•  Gerald Kaye’s annual salary will increase from £413,900 to 
£515,000. This is £20,800 lower than Michael Slade’s current 
annual salary and, reflecting best practice in respect of an internal 
promotion, will be phased over a two year period, with the second 
increase subject to the Committee being satisfied in respect of 
his individual performance. It is envisaged that Gerald Kaye’s 
salary will increase in line with RPI annually thereafter;
•  Duncan Walker’s annual salary will increase from £324,600  
to be the same as that of Matthew Bonning-Snook (currently 
£382,500) to reflect his additional responsibilities within the new 
Board structure. Again, reflecting best practice, this increase  
will be phased over a two year period with the second increase 
subject to the Committee being satisfied in respect of his 
individual performance;
•  The salary review date will be changed from 1 July to 1 April  
to align it to the financial year and the rest of the workforce 
although bonus calculations and new share awards will 
continue to be calculated with reference to salaries at 31 March;
•  The Executive Bonus Plan 2011, which was designed to reward 
the Chief Executive and Finance Director, will not be renewed 
so that in future only one Executive Director bonus 
arrangement will be operated. The terms of the proposed 
Annual Bonus Plan 2016 will be amended to permit the Chief 
Executive and Finance Director to participate;
•  The potential additional awards of up to 300% of salary in year 
five (2017) and year ten (2022) of the Annual Bonus Scheme 
2012 will be removed;
•  The calculation of the bonus under the proposed Annual Bonus 
Scheme 2016 will be simplified by operating one profit pool, 
(previously based on two pools) comprising all annual net rents, 
profits/losses on the sale and revaluation of assets, loan finance and 
administration costs and the costs of equity (to be fixed at 7% pa 
but subject to regular review). In addition, as a further 
amendment, distributions will continue to be restricted to a 
maximum of 300% of salary but with the previous additional 
restriction of bonuses being no more than 70% of the balance 
of the bonus pool being removed.
In considering shareholder protections:
•  The maximum potential annual bonus will be set at 200% of salary for 
the Finance Director and will remain at 300% for all other participants;
•  Rather than an unlimited carry forward in respect of the bonus 
pool, as currently operated, a maximum of 6.5 times the aggregate 
Executive Director salary pool may be carried forward;
•  Rather than a carry forward of the bonus pool of up to five 
years, the carry forward of any bonus pool not utilised in the 
year it is generated will be reduced to two years, with any 
remaining pool foregone. Reflecting this reduction in the carry 
forward, the minimum period during which losses can be 
carried forward will be reduced from three to two years;
•  Good Leavers will receive allocations and deferred share awards 
for up to two years (previously three years); and
•  A cap will be introduced on amounts payable upon a change of 
control (currently, amounts are uncapped).
Further details of the proposed new Annual Bonus Scheme 2016 
are shown on page 98 below and are set out in the 2016 Notice of 
Annual General Meeting (“AGM”).
In addition to these changes to remuneration, and reflecting 
consensus from a number of shareholders regarding the length of 
Executive Director notice periods, the Committee has agreed with 
all Executive Directors that their notice periods will be reduced 
from twelve months to six months without compensation.
The Company policy of not providing pension provision will 
continue and no changes are being proposed in respect of the 
operation of the PSP.
REMUNERATION POLICY  
FOR THE YEAR TO 31 MARCH 2017
The Committee is committed to ensuring that its remuneration 
policy remains aligned to the interests of shareholders – 
incentivising management to increase total returns and growing 
net asset value per share – whilst ensuring that an appropriate 
balance is maintained between the targets set for management 
and the risk profile of the Group. The Committee believes it has 
struck the right balance between fixed annual remuneration and 
an incentive structure with challenging targets which seek to 
reward outperformance with a mixture of cash-based bonus 
payments and longer term share awards set for management and 
the risk profile of the Group. 
In addition to the changes made to the salaries of Gerald Kaye and 
Duncan Walker, referred to above, the Committee determined that 
the basic salaries of the remaining executive directors should be 
increased from 1 April 2016 by 1.6% (2015: 2.0%), which is below the 
average 7% (2015: 8%) awarded to all other employees of the Group.
Further details of the implementation of the proposed remuneration 
policy for the year to 31 March 2017 can be found on pages 97 to 99. 
ANNUAL GENERAL MEETING 
At the AGM to be held on 25 July 2016, the following resolutions 
relating to remuneration are being proposed:
•  The approval of the Remuneration Policy Report;
•  The approval of the Annual Statement and Annual Report on 
Remuneration for the year to 31 March 2016; and,
•  The approval of the Annual Bonus Scheme 2016.
I trust that shareholders will support the Committee and vote in 
favour of these resolutions.

DIRECTORS’ REMuNERATION REPORT
The Report of the Remuneration Committee has been 
prepared in accordance with the Large and Medium-sized 
Companies and Groups (Accounts and Reports) 
(Amendment) Regulations 2013 (the “Regulations”). The 
Company’s remuneration policy follows the principles and 
guidelines of the Listing Rules and the UK Corporate 
Governance Code 2012 as they relate to directors’ 
remuneration.
The Company’s Remuneration Policy Report was previously 
approved by shareholders at the Annual General Meeting 
held on 25 July 2014 for a maximum period of three years. 
However, in view of changes to the remuneration of the 
Executive Directors, the expiry of the Executive Bonus Plan 
2011 and proposed replacement of the Annual Bonus 
Scheme 2012 with the Annual Bonus Scheme 2016, the 
Committee is seeking the approval of shareholders for an 
amended Remuneration Policy Report. 
REMUNERATION POLICY REPORT
This section of the Remuneration Report sets out the 
remuneration policy of the Group. Changes to this policy since its 
2014 approval are outlined in the report but the Committee 
believes that the policy continues to support the Group’s strategy 
and is aligned with shareholders’ interests. 
REMUNERATION POLICY
Helical’s approach to the remuneration of its Executive Directors is 
to provide a basic remuneration package below the median level 
of its peers within the listed real estate sector (the FTSE 350 
Super Sector Real Estate Index, excluding storage companies and 
agencies) combined with an incentive based bonus and share 
scheme structure aligned with the interests of its shareholders. 
Remuneration within the real estate sector is monitored and 
reviewed regularly to ensure that the Group’s positioning of its 
remuneration remains in line with these objectives. In addition to this 
external view , the Committee also monitors the remuneration levels of 
senior management below Board level and the remuneration of 
other employees to ensure that these are taken into account in 
determining the remuneration of Executive Directors and 
considers environmental, social, governance and risk issues.
In determining such policy, the Committee shall take into account 
all factors which it deems necessary. The objective of the 
remuneration policy shall be to ensure that Executive Directors 
and senior management are provided with appropriate incentives 
to encourage enhanced performance and are, in a fair and 
responsible manner, rewarded for their individual contributions to 
the success of the Group. Within the terms of the agreed policy 
the Committee shall determine, for the Executive Directors:
•  The total individual remuneration packages of each executive 
director including, where appropriate, basic salaries, bonuses, 
share awards, and other benefits;
•  T argets for any performance related remuneration schemes; and,
•  Service agreements incorporating termination payments and 
compensation commitments.

DIRECTORS’ REMUNERATION POLICY TABLE
The table below summarises the directors’ remuneration policy which will be put to shareholders for approval at the 2016 AGM. 
The proposed policy differs from that approved by shareholders at the 2014 AGM as follows:
•  The salary review date will be changed from 1 July to 1 April to align it to the financial year and the rest of the workforce;
•  The Executive Bonus Plan 2011, which was designed to reward the Chief Executive and Finance Director, will not be renewed so that in 
future only one Executive Director bonus arrangement will be operated. The terms of the proposed Annual Bonus Plan 2016 will allow 
all Executive Directors, including the Chief Executive and Finance Director, to participate; and,
•  The proposed Annual Bonus Plan 2016 simplifies the bonus calculation and introduces a number of additional shareholder protections.

DIRECTORS’ REMuNERATION REPORT
REMuNERATION POLICY REPORT
RECRUITMENT POLICY
In considering the structure of the Board, the balance between Executive Directors and independent Non-Executive Directors and the 
skills, knowledge and experience required to ensure the Board functions in accordance with the Group’s objectives, the Committee will 
seek to apply the following principles in relation to the remuneration of new directors, whether by internal promotion or external appointment:
Element Policy
Salary The salary of newly appointed Executive Directors would reflect the individual’s experience and 
skills, and be targeted below the median of appropriate sector comparables, taking into account 
internal comparisons. On initial appointment, salaries would generally be set at a level lower than 
benchmarked for that role to allow for pay increases to market levels subject to satisfactory progress 
and contribution.
Benefits Benefits would be as are currently provided and periodically reviewed, being car or car allowance, car 
fuel allowance, private medical cover, permanent health insurance and life assurance.
Pension There is no Group pension scheme for Directors and no contributions are payable to Directors’ own 
pension schemes.
Annual bonus Annual bonus arrangements would be set in line with arrangements as approved by shareholders, with 
the Committee retaining the right to pro-rata any bonus payable in respect of the year of appointment.
Long term incentives Annual awards under the terms of the 2014 PSP will be made in accordance with the terms of that Plan.
Share Incentive Plan In line with that of existing Executive Directors.
Buy-out awards Should it be deemed necessary to compensate a new director for loss of bonus or incentives from a 
previous employer, the Committee may structure the remuneration of such director to buy-out any 
such bonus or incentives on a like-for-like basis in respect of currency (i.e. cash versus shares), timing 
and performance targets. Where possible such buy-out will be structured within the Company’s 
existing incentive arrangements but the Committee has the discretion to implement the exemption 
under rule 9.4.2 of the Listing Rules.
Non-Executive Directors Newly appointed Non-Executive Directors will be paid fees at a level consistent with existing Non-
Executive Directors. Fees would be paid pro-rata in the year of appointment.
HOW EMPLOYEE PAY IS TAKEN INTO ACCOUNT AND 
HOW IT COMPARES TO THE REMUNERATION POLICY 
OF EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
All permanent employees of the Group, including Executive 
Directors, receive a basic remuneration package including base 
salary, private medical cover, permanent health insurance, life 
assurance and membership of the Share Incentive Plan. In 
addition, Directors and senior management are entitled to the use 
of company cars or the payment of a car allowance and a car fuel 
allowance. Whilst employees below Board level are not entitled to 
participate in the Annual Bonus Scheme, discretionary bonuses 
are paid to employees on an individual basis depending on their 
performance and contribution. The Performance Share Plan is 
available to all employees but is primarily utilised to incentivise 
Executive Directors and senior management. An Inland Revenue 
approved Share Option Scheme is available for the Committee to 
grant options to those who do not receive awards under the 
Performance Share Plan. Consequently, Directors are not granted 
awards under this scheme. In determining executive remuneration, 
the Committee considers the overall remuneration of all the 
Group’s employees and, other than in exceptional circumstances, 
seeks to award increases in salaries at levels below those made to 
other staff and within its own guidelines. The remaining 
remuneration is weighted towards performance related awards. 
The Committee does not consult with its employees when 
drawing up the Group’s remuneration policy.
PERFORMANCE METRICS
The performance metrics used in the annual bonus scheme and 
the long term incentive plan are aligned with the Group’s Key 
Performance Indicators, discussed on pages 20 to 21.
The proposed Annual Bonus Scheme 2016 (and previously the 
Annual Bonus Scheme 2012), if approved at the 2016 AGM, is a 
profit sharing model which takes the results of the Company, 
including valuation movements on its property portfolio, and, after 
charging all finance costs, non-performance related administration 
costs and a charge for the use of the Group’s equity (initially set 
at 7% but subject to regular review), allocates the net results into 
a profit pool for payment to participants with maximum limits, 
deferral, clawback and other shareholder protections. The scheme 
will be open to all Executive Directors.
Long term incentives, awarded in accordance with the rules of the 
2014 PSP are subject to an absolute net asset value growth test, a 
relative performance metric based on the performance of the 
Group’s property portfolio compared to an IPD index and a 
relative performance metric based on Total Shareholder Return. HELICAL BAR PLC REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2016 89 GOVERNANCE
DIRECTORS’ REMuNERATION REPORT
REMuNERATION POLICY REPORT
LEAVER POLICY
On termination of employment each Director may be entitled to a 
payment in lieu of notice of basic salary and other contractual 
entitlements i.e. provision of a car, health and life insurance etc. 
The Group may make payments in lieu of notice as one lump sum 
or in instalments, at its own discretion. If the Group chooses to 
pay in instalments the Director is obliged to seek alternative income 
over the relevant period and to disclose the amount to the Group. 
Instalment payments will be reduced by any alternative income.
under the Annual Bonus Scheme 2016, participants shall not 
normally be entitled to receive any distribution under the scheme 
following cessation and shall immediately cease to have any 
interests, benefits, rights and/or entitlements under the scheme 
howsoever arising on the date of such cessation except where 
good leaver status applies (i.e. death; injury, disability; redundancy; 
retirement; sale or transfer of employing company or business 
outside of the Group or any other reason permitted by the 
Committee). For good leavers, individuals would cease to accrue 
future amounts into Bonus Award Pool although would continue 
to receive deferred share awards and any remaining amounts held 
in the Bonus Award Pool for a period of two years after cessation.
Any share-based entitlements granted to an Executive Director 
under the Group’s share plans will be determined based on the 
relevant plan rules. 
For awards granted under the 2014 PSP, awards held by good 
leavers will vest on the normal vesting date subject to performance 
conditions and time pro-rating, unless the Committee determines 
that awards should vest at cessation and/or time pro-rating 
should not apply.
NON-EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS 
Non-Executive Directors are appointed by a Letter of 
Appointment and their remuneration is determined by the Board. 
Current Letters of Appointment, setting out the terms of 
appointment, operate from 1 April 2015 or, if later, the date of 
appointment. The appointment of Non-Executive Directors is 
terminable on three months’ notice. Non-Executive Directors are 
not eligible to participate in any new share awards made under 
the terms of the Group’s bonus or share award schemes. In 
exceptional circumstances, where an Executive Director becomes 
a Non-Executive Director e.g. Michael Slade becoming Chairman 
in 2016 (subject to his re-election at the 2016 AGM), ongoing 
participation in awards previously made in bonus and share 
schemes will be subject to the rules of those schemes and will be 
subject to the discretion of the Committee.

normal maximum award (with target assumed to be 50% of the 
maximum). 
•  No share price appreciation in respect of deferred bonus and 
PSP awards has been assumed. 
REMUNERATION COMMITTEE
The Committee comprises Michael O’Donnell, as Chairman, and 
Richard Gillingwater and Richard Grant, all of whom have served 
throughout the year, Susan Clayton and Richard Cotton, both of 
whom have served on the Committee since their appointment to 
the Board. Each member of the Committee is an independent Non-
Executive Director. The Company Secretary acts as Secretary to 
the Committee. The terms of reference of the Committee are 
available on request and are included on the Group’s website at 
www.helical.co.uk. 
ADVISORS TO THE COMMITTEE
The Committee consults the Chief Executive and Finance Director 
about its proposals and has access to professional advice from 
independent remuneration consultants, New Bridge Street, to help 
it determine appropriate remuneration arrangements. T erms of 
reference for New Bridge Street, which provided no other services to the 
Company , are available from the Company Secretary on request. 
Their fees for the year to 31 March 2016 amounted to £20,384 
(2015: £42,710).
 
SHARE OWNERSHIP GUIDELINES
Senior Executives will not normally be permitted to sell shares 
received through the 2004 PSP/2014 PSP, other than to meet 
taxation (and national insurance contributions) liabilities, for at 
least two years and until they own shares to the value of 200% of 
basic salary for Executive Directors and 100% of salary for other 
Executives. The 200% of salary guideline for Executive Directors 
will increase to 300% on the fi rst vesting of share awards granted 
under the 2014 PSP. 
ALIGNMENT WITH SHAREHOLDER INTERESTS
The Remuneration Committee has analysed the potential gains 
that may be made by Executives (Directors and those below 
Board level) through the 2004 PSP/2014 PSP and other incentive 
arrangements currently in place. It has concluded that the share 
of the increase in the value of the Group (measured as the 
increase in the net asset value, before incentives, plus cash 
returned as dividends to shareholders) that could accrue to all 
Executives through the Group’s long and short-term incentive and 
bonus plans at the point at which the maximum awards vest over 
the term of the plans might be of the order of 20%. At this point, 
in absolute terms, the Group will have increased its triple net asset 
value by at least 15% per annum with the Group’s relative 
performance placing it in the top quartile of IPD and Total 
Shareholder Return, over each three year period. 
REWARD SCENARIOS
The charts below show how the composition of the Executive 
Directors’ remuneration packages varies at three performance 
levels, namely, at minimum (i.e. fi xed pay), target (assumed to be 
50% of the maximum incentive levels) and maximum levels, under 
the policy set out in the table overleaf.  HELICAL BAR PLC REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2016 91 GOVERNANCE

EXECUTIVE BONUS PLAN 2011 
In 2011, shareholders approved the renewal of the Executive Bonus 
Plan (the “2011 Plan”) for a further five years. Michael Slade and Tim 
Murphy were eligible for 2011 Plan bonuses during the year. T otal 
2011 Plan bonuses for the year to 31 March 2016 of £2,000,000 
(2015: £2,000,000) have been accrued in the financial statements 
for the year to 31 March 2016 and are payable in June 2016.
The performance conditions which applied for the year ended 31 
March 2016 were as follows:
•  increase in net asset value: net asset value at the end of the 
financial year exceeds net asset value at the beginning of the 
financial year;
•  absolute performance of the portfolio – un-geared total return: 
the percentage increase in the total return on property assets 
of the Group over the financial year (the “Performance Period”) 
is greater than the percentage increase achieved by the 
portfolio ranked nearest to three-quarters up the performance 
table (taken in ascending order of return) (the “upper 
Quartile”) of the portfolios of all quarterly valued funds 
measured by the Investment Property Databank at the 
beginning of the relevant Performance Period and compounded 
monthly during the Performance Period (the “IPD Total Return 
Benchmark”); and,
•  performance of the net asset value per share: the percentage 
increase in net asset value per share for the Performance Period 
must be greater than the percentage increase achieved by the 
upper Quartile of the portfolios of all quarterly valued funds 
measured by the Investment Property Databank at the 
beginning of the relevant Performance Period and compounded 
monthly during the Performance Period (the “IPD Capital 
Growth Benchmark”).
The total amount of bonus payable in the year to 31 March 2016 
was determined by: 
•  calculating the difference between the percentage increase in 
net asset value per share for the Performance Period and the 
percentage increase in the upper Quartile of the IPD Capital 
Growth Benchmark over the same period (the “Difference”); and
•  calculating the sum of the amounts payable in relation to each 
1% of the Difference on the following basis:
Amount of difference
% of base net asset  
value payable
Less than 1% 0.01
1% to less than 2% 0.02
And thereafter for every additional 1% An increment of 0.01
For example: From 4% to less than 5% 0.05
If the net asset value at the end of a financial year is less than the 
net asset value at the beginning of that year, the bonus payable 
for any subsequent year will be calculated by reference to the 
highest net asset value in the preceding year.
Applying this methodology to the results for the year to 31 March 
2016, the bonus for the year was calculated as follows:
1. Increase in net asset value per share, pre dividends and 
performance related awards
Net asset value per share at 1 April 2015 385p 
Net asset value per share at 31 March 2016* 475p 
Increase in net asset value per share  23.6%
*Adjusted for dividends and performance related awards paid or accrued 
during the year. HELICAL BAR PLC REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2016 93 GOVERNANCE
DIRECTORS’ REMuNERATION REPORT
ANNuAL REPORT ON REMuNERATION
2. Absolute performance of the portfolio
Performance of portfolio as measured by IPD 21.7% 
upper quartile of IPD Total Return Benchmark 13.0%
3. Performance of net asset value per share
Increase in net asset value per share  23.6% 
upper quartile of IPD Capital Growth Benchmark 8.0%
Applying these percentages to the net asset value base, the 
percentage increase in the actual net asset value above that was 
derived by applying the upper quantile of the IPD Capital Growth 
Benchmark is 14.43%. Applying this outperformance to the base 
net asset value results in a potential payment of £4,606,000 
(2015: £4,612,000). This was reduced to the maximum amount 
payable of £2,000,000 (2015: £2,000,000).
Bonuses paid under the terms of this 2011 Plan in the last seven 
years are as follows:
Year Amount Paid £
2016 2,000,000
2015 2,000,000
2014 2,000,000
2013 1,297,000
2012 nil 
2011 nil 
2010 nil
The Executive Bonus Plan 2011 reached the end of its shareholder 
approved life at 31 March 2016 and no further payments will be 
made in respect of this scheme for subsequent periods. 
HELICAL BAR ANNUAL BONUS SCHEME 2012
The Helical Bar Annual Bonus Scheme 2012 was approved by 
shareholders at the 2012 AGM. This scheme provides annual cash 
bonuses based on the performance of the Group’s property 
portfolio and is aligned with shareholders through a profit sharing 
model, with appropriate hurdles and shareholder protections 
(including deferral and clawback). Total 2012 Bonus Scheme 
Bonuses have been accrued in the financial statements for the 
year to 31 March 2016 and the cash element will be payable in 
June 2016. 
The main features of the 2012 Bonus Scheme as applied to the 
year to 31 March 2016 were as follows:
•  the scheme participants were Gerald Kaye, Matthew Bonning-
Snook and Duncan Walker. Former director, Jack Pitman, 
remained eligible for a bonus in respect of the bonus pool 
carried forward from 31 March 2015. Neither the Chief Executive 
nor the Finance Director participated in the Scheme given their 
participation in the 2011 Plan;
•  all property assets held during the year were allocated to one of 
two pools namely the “Investment Pool” or the “Development 
Pool” (“Profit Pools”);
•  investment assets were included at valuation as at 31 March 2015 
with subsequent valuation movements increasing or decreasing the 
size of the relevant Profit Pool. Development assets were also 
included at valuation as at 31 March 2015 with subsequent valuation 
movements increasing or decreasing the size of the Profit Pool. Any 
opening surpluses or deficits in the value of the trading and 
development assets as at the introduction of the scheme on 1 April 
2012 were only included in the Profit Pools if they were realised;
•  development profits, development management fees, net rents, 
other income and profits/losses on the sale of property assets 
were allocated to the relevant Profit Pools; and,
•  profits in the two Profit Pools were eligible for the award of 
bonuses once they were sufficient to exceed the recovery of all 
related finance costs, a charge for the use of the Company’s 
equity at a rate equivalent to the Company’s weighted average 
cost of debt plus a margin (reviewed regularly to reflect any 
changes in the cost of debt and the risk profile of the 
Company’s activities), the Group’s total administrative costs 
(excluding performance related remuneration) and any 
unallocated losses from the previous three financial years.
Shareholder Protections 
•  no more than 10% of profits were available to participants for 
distribution (“Bonus Award Pool”) at the end of the relevant 
financial year. Pool allocations between participants were based 
on a set formula agreed at the start of the financial year;
•  the distribution of the Bonus Award Pools to participants were 
restricted in any financial year to the lower of 70% of the balance 
of the Bonus Award Pool and 300% of salary. Any excess is 
deferred and carried forward to the subsequent year to form 
part of the Bonus Award Pool for the subsequent year(s);
•  two thirds of any payment is made in cash after the relevant 
financial year end and one third is deferred for three years into 
Helical Bar plc shares; and,
•  other shareholder protections as noted on page 98 in respect of 
the Annual Bonus Scheme 2016.
Bonus Scheme Pool – Year to 31 March 2016
The amount transferred to the Bonus Pool based on the results of the Group for the year to 31 March 2016 and its allocation to cash and 
deferred share awards is as follows:
2016
£
2015

Amount paid as cash bonuses (3,216,000) (3,172,000)
Amount paid as deferred shares (1,122,000) (1,099,000)
Bonus Pool carried forward 24,007,000 15,812,000
The proposed changes to this bonus scheme, to be reflected in the Annual Bonus Scheme 2016, are expected to reduce the Bonus Pool 
carried forward at 31 March 2016 to c. £10,400,000.  HELICAL BAR PLC REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2016 94

Other matters
•  whilst shareholder approval for the Plan was obtained for ten 
years from 1 April 2012, the Remuneration Committee has 
reviewed the operation of the Plan early in light of the various 
Board changes, the expiry of the Executive Bonus Plan 2011 and 
general sensitivities surrounding executive pay and, subject to 
shareholder approval, intends replacing the Plan with the Helical 
Annual Bonus Plan 2016 with additional shareholder 
protections. Further details of this new plan are noted on page 98 
and are set out in the 2016 Notice of AGM;
•  awards may be satisfied through shares purchased in the 
market or by new issue or treasury shares. Where new issue or 
treasury shares are used, the ABI’s 5% in ten year dilution limit 
will apply; and,
•  on a change of control of the Company, any amounts accrued 
over the financial year up to the relevant date, and any amounts 
held within the Bonus Award Pools will be paid out, subject to a 
cap on those awards of 600% of base salary, Any deferred 
shares would vest immediately.
PSP AWARDS VESTING IN 2016

The share price used to calculate the expected value at vesting was 398.75p, based on the average share price over the three months to 31 March 2016.
The 2004 PSP numbers presented for the comparatives in the 
remuneration table above are based on the 2004 PSP awards 
granted on 31 May 2012. The three year performance period to 31 
March 2015 showed that the net asset value per share, calculated 
in accordance with the terms of the 2004 PSP, had increased by 
18.1% p.a. During this three year period the total return of Helical’s 
property portfolio, as determined by IPD, was 17.4% compared to 
the upper quantile of the IPD Benchmark which showed a return of 
12.3%. Therefore, 100% of the shares vested. The share price used to 
calculate the expected value at vesting for the 2012 PSP awards 
was 387.24p (based on the average share price over the three 
months to 31 March 2015). The actual share price at vesting on 15 
September 2015 was 421.00p.

PAYMENTS TO FORMER DIRECTORS – DEPARTURE OF JACK PITMAN 
As disclosed last year, Jack Pitman stepped down from the Board on 13 February 2015 and ceased employment on 31 March 2015. No 
payments in respect of salary and car allowance were made after 31 March 2015 although in line with his termination arrangements, Jack 
Pitman’s Group health insurance continued until the end of the policy in October 2015. 
In respect of his incentives, it was determined by the Remuneration Committee that Jack Pitman should be treated as a Good Leaver for 
the purposes of the Annual Bonus Scheme 2012 and his outstanding PSP awards. 
He will receive cash bonuses in respect of the Annual Bonus Scheme 2012 in respect of the balance remaining in that scheme at 31 
March 2015 for a further three years in line with the plan rules, subject to offset of future losses and clawback. A payment of £973,950 
will be made in June 2016 at the normal payment date. 
The 2013 PSP (granted under the 2004 PSP) is expected to vest in full, subject to time pro-rating. The estimated value, based on the average share 
price over the three months to 31 March 2016 of 398.75p is £1,010,983. The 2014 PSP award (granted under the 2014 PSP) is expected to vest in June

EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS’ BASIC ANNUAL SALARY 
AND BENEFITS-IN-KIND
The basic package of salary and benefits is designed to match the 
experience and responsibilities of each director and is reviewed 
annually to ensure that it is consistent with and appropriate to their 
responsibilities and expectations. The Group does not provide any 
separate pension provision for Executive Directors and expects 
individuals to provide for their retirement through their basic salaries 
and incentive payments. Executive Directors’ basic annual salaries at 
31 March 2016 and increases from 1 April 2016 are as follows:

Matthew Bonning-Snook 382,500 6,100 388,600
Duncan Walker 324,600 32,400 357,000
The Committee’s policy in respect of basic salaries is that they 
should be reviewed annually and increased to reflect an 
appropriate level of inflation (being linked to the Retail Prices 
Index) or greater to reflect increases in the scale, scope or 
responsibility of their roles or to allow recently appointed 
Executives to move to market norms as their experience and 
contributions increase. At the 2016 AGM to be held on 25 July 
2016, Michael Slade is to step down as Chief Executive. His salary 
will remain at its current level of £535,800 until the AGM, from 
which date he will be remunerated (subject to his re-election) as 
Non-Executive Chairman. Gerald Kaye, subject to his re-election, 
will become the Chief Executive from 25 July 2016. In recognition 
of his increased responsibilities, his basic salary is to increase to 
£515,000 pa, £20,800 below that of the current Chief Executive 
salary, in two stages. This basic salary increased to £475,000 pa 
on 1 April 2016 and will be increased to £515,000 pa on 1 April 
2017 subject to the Committee being satisfied in respect of his 
individual performance. Thereafter, he is expected to receive 
inflationary increases each year. Duncan Walker has taken on 
increased responsibilities over the last twelve months and in 
recognition of this it is intended that his basic salary will increase 
to that of Matthew Bonning-Snook over the course of two salary 
reviews. He received an increase to £357,000 pa on 1 April 2016 
and is expected to receive a further increase to c. £391,350 pa, 
subject to RPI, on 1 April 2017, and subject to the Committee 
being satisfied in respect of his individual performance. Thereafter, 
he is expected to receive inflationary increases each year. In 
addition to these two changes, the Committee has determined 
that the remaining two Executive Directors will receive increases 
of 1.6%, being the increase in RPI to 31 March 2016, from 1 April 
2016, compared to an average 6.8% awarded to other employees. 
BENEFITS-IN-KIND 
Benefits-in-kind provided to Executive Directors comprise the 
provision of a company car or car allowance, car fuel, private 
medical cover, permanent health insurance, life insurance and 
participation in the Company’s Share Incentive Plan. There is no 
Group pension scheme for Directors and no contributions will be 
paid by the Group to the Directors’ own pension schemes. 
NON-EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS’ FEES
Michael Slade, subject to his re-election at the 2016 AGM, will 
become Non-Executive Chairman on 25 July 2016, replacing Nigel 
McNair Scott who is retiring. Fees payable to him for the role will 
be £155,000 pa plus an additional benefit-in-kind of £20,000 for 
use of secretarial support for non-business use. The fees payable 
to the remaining independent Non-Executive Directors have been 
reviewed and an increase of £3,000 pa has been awarded with 
effect from 1 April 2016. This increase takes the base fee to 
£45,000 pa with an additional £10,000 pa payable to the Senior

ANNUAL BONUSES
EXECUTIVE BONUS PLAN 2011
The Executive Bonus Plan 2011 reached the end of its shareholder 
approved life at 31 March 2016 and ceased operation at this date. 
Of the two participants in the Plan in the year to 31 March 2016, 
Michael Slade is stepping down as Chief Executive and will no 
longer be eligible for annual bonuses and Tim Murphy, subject to 
shareholder approval, will be eligible to participate in the Annual 
Bonus Scheme 2016. 
The main features of the 2011 Plan, and details of how it operated 
for the year ended 31 March 2016, are set out on pages 92 to 93.
ANNUAL BONUS SCHEME 2012
This scheme has been reviewed by the Committee and, following 
consultation with major shareholders, will be replaced by the 
Helical Annual Bonus Scheme 2016, subject to shareholder 
approval at the 2016 AGM.
The main features of the 2012 Bonus Scheme and how it operated 
for the year ended 31 March 2016 are set out on pages 93 to 94.
As disclosed last year, Jack Pitman, a former director, will continue 
to receive annual bonuses out of the Bonus Award Pool accrued up 
to 31 March 2015, in accordance with the “Good Leaver” provisions 
of the scheme.
ANNUAL BONUS SCHEME 2016
Gerald Kaye, Tim Murphy, Matthew Bonning-Snook and Duncan 
Walker will, subject to shareholder approval, participate in the 
Annual Bonus Scheme 2016 which is to be considered by 
Shareholders at the 2016 AGM. This scheme provides annual 
bonuses based on the performance of the Group’s property 
portfolio and is aligned with shareholders’ interests through a 
profit sharing model, with appropriate hurdles and shareholder 
protections (including deferral and clawback). 
The main features of the Annual Bonus Scheme 2016, as applied 
to the year to 31 March 2017, are as follows:
•  all property assets held at 1 April 2016 or acquired during the 
year will be allocated to a Profit Pool;
•  investment assets will be included at valuation as at 31 March 2016 
with subsequent valuation movements increasing or decreasing the 
size of the Profit Pool. Development assets will also be included at 
valuation as at 31 March 2016 with subsequent valuation 
movements increasing or decreasing the size of the Profit Pool;
•  development profits, development management fees, net rents, 
other income and profits/losses on the sale of property assets 
will be allocated to the Profit Pools; and,
•  profits in the Profit Pool will be eligible for the award of bonuses 
once they are sufficient to exceed the recovery of all related finance 
costs, a charge for the use of the Company’s equity at a rate of 7% 
(reviewed regularly to reflect any changes in the risk profile of the 
Company’s activities), and the Group’s total administrative costs 
(excluding performance related remuneration).
Shareholder Protections 
•  no more than 10% of profits will be available to participants for 
distribution (“Bonus Award Pool”) at the end of the relevant 
financial year;
•  the distribution of the Bonus Award Pool to participants will be 
restricted in any financial year to 300% of salary (200% for Tim 
Murphy). Any excess is deferred and carried forward to the 
subsequent year to form part of the Bonus Award Pool for the 
subsequent two year(s);
•  a maximum of 6.5 times the aggregate Executive Director 
salary pool may be carried forward to form part of the Bonus 
Award Pool for the subsequent year;
•  two thirds of any payment is made in cash after the relevant 
financial year end and one third is deferred for three years into 
Helical Bar plc shares;
•  no payments will be made where the Company has not generated 
a profit (amounts will be deferred until a profit is generated). In 
addition, the Remuneration Committee will retain discretion to 
increase the deferred share amount (up to 100% of the payment) 
or not to make a payment at all (with any amounts reverting 
back to the Company rather than remaining in the Bonus 
Award Pool) where it is considered appropriate to do so;
•  net losses will be carried forward for offset against future net profits. 
Carry forward of losses will be for a minimum of two years, subject to 
extension at the request of the Remuneration Committee;
•  the scheme will operate a clawback provision whereby amounts 
deferred, amounts held in Bonus Award Pools or the net of tax 
amounts paid may be recovered in the event of a misstatement 
of results, an error being made in assessing the calculation of 
Bonus Award Pools or in the event of gross misconduct; and,
•  the share of any increase in value of the Company (measured 
as the increase in net asset value plus cash returned as 
dividends) that could accrue to all Executives through the 
Group’s long and short-term incentive and bonus plans at 
maximum vesting/payouts during the lifetime of the plans will 
continue to be no more than 20%. HELICAL BAR PLC REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2016 99 GOVERNANCE

LONG-TERM INCENTIVES 
PERFORMANCE SHARE PLAN
It is anticipated that long-term incentives will be granted to all 
Executive Directors and senior management in the form of shares 
awarded under the terms of the 2014 PSP Scheme. For Executive 
Directors the awards will be granted at 300% of base salary. 
The main features of the 2014 PSP are as follows:
•  awards will normally vest no earlier than the third anniversary of 
their grant to the extent that the applicable performance 
conditions (see below) have been satisfi ed and the participant 
is still employed by the Group. Once exercisable, awards will 
remain capable of exercise for a period of normally no more 
than six months;
•  no award may be granted to an individual in any fi nancial year 
over shares worth more than three times salary;
•  there are three performance conditions, one based on absolute 
growth in the Group’s net asset value per share, one based on 
the gross (ungeared) total property return per share relative to 
other property funds as determined by IPD and one based on 
relative total shareholder return; and,
•  performance conditions for the awards to be granted in 2016 
will, subject to shareholder approval, be measured over the 
three years following grant as follows.
Growth in net asset value
The “fully diluted triple net” net asset value as at the start of the fi nancial 
year in which a grant takes place will be compared to the value three years 
later (having added back dividends and changes in issued share capital): 
Annual compound increase after 
three years % of award vesting
15% p.a. or more 33.3
Between 7.5% p.a. and 15% p.a. Pro rata between 3.3 and 33.3 
7.5% p.a. 3.3
Below 7.5% p.a. Zero
If uK infl ation (RPI) is higher than 3% per annum over the three 
year period then the required compound increases will be raised 
by the excess over the 3% per annum average.
Total property return versus IPD property funds
Ranking after three years % of award vesting
upper quartile or above 33.3
Between median and 
upper quartile 
Pro rata between 3.3 and 33.3
Median 3.3

Ranking after three years % of award vesting
upper quartile or above 33.3
Between median and 
upper quartile 
Pro rata between 3.3 and 33.3

The comparator group for the awards to be granted in 2016 will 
be the companies included in the FTSE 350 Super Sector Real 
Estate Index, excluding storage companies and agencies. 
Share awards will lapse in full where:
•  net asset value per share (having added back dividends) does 
not increase over the three year performance period; or
•   the gross return falls below the IPD median, the growth in triple 
net asset value is below 7.5% per annum and relative TSR is 
below median over the three year period.
TOTAL SHAREHOLDER RETURN AND CHIEF 
EXECUTIVE’S REMUNERATION 
The total shareholder returns for a holding in the Group’s shares in 
the three, seven and ten years to 31 March 2016 compared to a 
holding in the FTSE 350 Super-sector Real Estate Index are 
shown in the graphs below. This index has been chosen because it 
includes the majority of listed real estate companies.
Three years to 31 March 2016 
The graph showing the relative performance of Helical during the 
three years to 31 March 2016 matches the performance period for 
the 2004 PSP Award granted on 24 June 2013 and which will vest 
after 25 June 2016. The graph shows that Helical outperformed 
the benchmark index during this period.

Seven years to 31 March 2016 
The base position at 31 March 2009, from which subsequent 
performance is measured as required by the Regulations, is the 
nearest accounting period end to the bottom of the property 
cycle. Helical’s share price at that date was 287.50 per share, a 
small premium to the EPRA net asset value per share of 286.00 
pence per share. The Company’s share price, at that stage, had 
not fallen as much as the average of the FTSE 350 Super-Sector 
Real Estate Index and remained at a premium until 2012. The 
subsequent performance of the Company’s TSR refl ects the 
relatively higher base position of Helical’s share price.

to a statutory duty to avoid a situation where they have, or can 
have, a direct or indirect interest that conflicts, or may possibly 
conflict, with the interests of the Company. As is permissible 
under the Act, the Company’s Articles of Association allow the 
Board to consider, and if it sees fit, to authorise situations where a

the Directors against claims made against them as a consequence 
of the execution of their duties as directors of the Company. 
POLITICAL DONATIONS
The Company’s policy with regard to political donations is to 
ensure that shareholder approval is sought before making any 
such payments. No shareholder approval has been sought and, 
accordingly, the Company made no political donations in the year 
to 31 March 2016. 
FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS, CAPITALISED INTEREST

REPORT OF THE DIRECTORS
CHANGE OF CONTROL 
Certain agreements between the Company or its subsidiaries and 
entities including lending banks, joint venture partners and 
development partners contain termination rights to take effect in

due in 2020 (the “Bonds”), upon a change of control event as 
defined by the terms and conditions of the Bonds, the 
bondholders will have the option to require the Company to 
redeem or, at the Company’s option, purchase the Bonds at their 
nominal amount together with accrued interest.
Similarly, if a change of control event occurs, the holders of the 
Convertible Bonds of £100m, issued on 17 June 2014 at 4.00% and 
due for redemption in June 2019, have the right to require the 
issuer to redeem the Convertible Bonds at their principal amount

to have taken as a Director to make himself aware of any relevant 
information and to establish that the Company’s auditors are 
aware of that information.

The Directors are responsible for 
preparing the Strategic Report, Annual 
Report, the Remuneration Report and 
the financial statements in accordance 
with applicable law and regulations.
Company law requires the Directors to prepare financial 
statements for each financial year. Under that law the directors 
have to prepare the financial statements in accordance with 
International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted 
by the European Union. Under company law the directors 
must not approve the financial statements unless they are 
satisfied that they give a true and fair view of the state of 
affairs and profit or loss of the Company and Group for 
that period.
In preparing these financial statements, the directors are required to:
•  select suitable accounting policies and then apply them 
consistently;
•  make judgements and accounting estimates that are reasonable 
and prudent;
•  state whether applicable IFRSs have been followed, subject to 
any material departures disclosed and explained in the financial 
statements; and
•  prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis 
unless it is inappropriate to presume that the Company will 
continue in business.
The directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting 
records that are sufficient to show and explain the Company’s 
transactions and disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time 
the financial position of the Company and enable them to ensure 
that the financial statements and the Remuneration Report 
comply with the Companies Act 2006 and Article 4 of the IAS 
Regulation. They are also responsible for safeguarding the assets 
of the Company and hence for taking reasonable steps for the 
prevention and detection of fraud and other irregularities.
The Directors confirm that: 
•  so far as each Director is aware, there is no relevant audit 
information of which the company’s auditor is unaware; and
•  the Directors have taken all the steps that they ought to have 
taken as directors in order to make themselves aware of any 
relevant audit information and to establish that the auditors are 
aware of that information.
The Directors consider the Annual Report and the financial 
statements, taken as a whole, provides the information necessary to 
assess the Company’s performance, business model and strategy 
and is fair, balanced and understandable. 
The Directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity of 
the corporate and financial information included on the Group’s 
website. Legislation in the united Kingdom governing the preparation 
and dissemination of financial statements may differ from 
legislation in other jurisdictions. 
We confirm to the best of our knowledge:
•  the Group financial statements, prepared in accordance with 
IFRSs as adopted by the European union, give a true and fair 
view of the assets, liabilities, financial position and profit or loss 
of the Company and the undertakings included in the consolidation 
taken as a whole; and 
•  the Annual Report including the Strategic Report, includes a fair 
review of the development and performance of the business and 
the position of the Company and the undertakings included in 
the consolidation taken as a whole, together with a description 
of the principal risks and uncertainties that they face.

WHO WE ARE REPORTING TO
This report is made solely to the Company’s members, as a body, 
in accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies Act 2006. 
Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might state to the 
Company’s members those matters we are required to state to them 
in an auditor’s report and for no other purpose. T o the fullest extent 
permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility to anyone 
other than the Company and the Company’s members as a body, 
for our audit work, for this report, or for the opinions we have formed.
WHAT WE HAVE AUDITED
Helical Bar plc’s financial statements comprise the Consolidated 
Income Statement, the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive 
Income, the Consolidated and Company Balance Sheets, the 
Consolidated and Company Cash Flow Statements, the Consolidated 
and Company Statements of Changes in Equity and the related notes.
The financial reporting framework that has been applied in their 
preparation is applicable law and IFRSs as adopted by the 
European union and, as regards the Parent Company financial 
statements, as applied in accordance with the provisions of the 
Companies Act 2006.
OVERVIEW OF OUR AUDIT APPROACH
•  Overall group materiality: £4.858 million which represents 
approximately 1% of the Group’s net assets;
•  We performed full scope audit procedures at all material 
locations; and
•  Key audit risks were identified as revenue recognition; 
investment property valuation; carrying value of land, 
development and trading properties and the disclosures made 
in respect of unrecognised development surpluses; and 
employee remuneration, including charges in respect of the 
Performance Share Plan and Bonuses. 
OUR ASSESSMENT OF RISK 
In arriving at our opinions set out in this report, we highlight the 
following risks that, in our judgement, had the greatest effect on 
our audit. 
INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORT 
TO THE MEMBERS OF HELICAL BAR PLC
Audit risk How we responded to the risk
REVENUE RECOGNITION
The risk: The revenue cycle includes 
fraudulent transactions.
u nder International Standards on 
Auditing (u K and Ireland) 240 there 
is a presumed risk that revenue may 
be misstated owing to the improper 
recognition of revenue. The Group has 
complex contracts for which the timing 
and quantum of revenue recognition 
require the exercise of management 
judgement.
Dependent upon the nature of the 
contract, this risk applies to development 
property profit, share of results of 
joint ventures and net gain on sale and 
revaluation of investment properties.
We therefore identified revenue 
recognition as a risk requiring special 
audit consideration.
Our work included, but was not limited to:
•  evaluating the Group’s revenue recognition policies to confirm that they comply with 
International Financial Reporting Standards and have been applied consistently;
•   testing property sales, and on a sample basis residential units in retirement villages, 
to contracts, completion statements and proceeds received;
•  agreeing, on a sample basis, net rental income to managing agents’ reports and the 
underlying lease agreements;
•  testing development profits to the underlying contracts having regard to the stage 
of completion - this included challenging development profits where the project 
appraisals had changed from previous years and obtaining explanations and 
supporting third-party evidence where practicable;
•  assessing the challenges made by the valuations Committee where changes in 
development project appraisals occurred; and
•  in respect of the development contract that involved the exercise of the greatest 
degree of management judgement, challenging the judgements made and 
undertaking sensitivity analysis to evaluate the level of precision of the development 
profit recognised; the Senior Statutory Auditor made a physical inspection of this site 
and made enquiries of on-site personnel to confirm that the accounting judgements in 
respect of the stage of completion aligned with the physical status of the development.
The Group’s accounting policy on revenue recognition is shown in note 38. The 
components of revenue and profits are included in notes 3 to 6 and 19. The Audit 
Committee also identified revenue recognition as a key area of judgement on page 
81, where the Committee describes how it addressed the issue.
We were satisfied that:
•  based on our audit work the judgements made, and assumptions used, by 
management in determining the revenue recognised, were balanced and supported 
by the evidence obtained from our testing. HELICAL BAR PLC REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2016 107 GOVERNANCE
INDEPENDENT AuDITOR’S REPORT 
Audit risk How we responded to the risk
INVESTMENT PROPERTY VALUATION 
 
The risk: Investment properties are not 
valued appropriately.
Investment property is held at fair value 
under International Accounting Standard 
40. The fair value of all of the Group’s 
investment properties is determined 
based on level 3 fair value inputs as 
defined by International Financial 
Reporting Standard 13 which means that 
the inputs used in valuing investment 
properties are unobservable and are 
therefore subject to estimation.
We therefore identified investment 
property valuation as a risk requiring 
special audit consideration.
Investment properties are valued at 
£1,041 million.
Our work included, but was not limited to:
•  examining the qualifications and experience of the Group’s independent external 
valuers and whether the basis of their valuations was consistent with the RICS “red 
book” as required by International Accounting Standard 40;
•  discussions with the independent valuers and challenging the estimates, 
assumptions and valuation methodology used;
•  obtaining the information provided by management to the independent valuers to 
confirm it was consistent with information obtained during our audit;
•  evaluating evidence of the reliability of valuation estimations by comparing the 
historical trend of investment property sales with the related carrying values;
• evaluating the challenge to valuations made by the valuations Committee; and
•  comparing, on a sample basis, valuation yields used in preparing valuations with 
yields for comparable properties published in the CBRE Monthly Index.
The Group’s accounting policy on investment properties is shown in note 38. 
Disclosures on investment properties are set out in note 15. Disclosures in respect of 
investment properties held by joint ventures are set out in note 19. The Audit Committee 
also identified the valuation of the Group’s investment property as a key area of 
judgement on page 81, where the Committee describes how it addressed the issue.
We were satisfied that:
•  investment property valuations were made by suitably qualified and experienced 
independent valuations experts and subject to challenge by the valuations Committee;
•  the judgements made, and assumptions used, in determining the investment 
property valuations were balanced and supported by the evidence obtained from 
our testing; and
•  for the sample of properties selected, yields used by management and the 
independent valuers were consistent with or more prudent than those published in 
the CBRE Monthly Index, but not to a significant extent.
CARRYING VALUE OF LAND, 
DEVELOPMENT AND TRADING 
PROPERTIES AND THE DISCLOSURES 
MADE IN RESPECT OF UNRECOGNISED 
DEVELOPMENT SURPLUSES
The risk: Land, developments and trading 
properties are inventory and are included 
in the Balance Sheet at the lower of cost 
and net realisable value in accordance 
with International Accounting Standard 
2. The notes include disclosures about 
Directors’ valuations of unrecognised 
surpluses in these properties and those 
valuations impact certain non-statutory 
key performance indicators disclosed by 
the Group (eg “EPRA” net asset values). 
These unrecognised surpluses (and net 
realisable value assessments) are based 
upon estimation methodologies used by 
management.
We therefore identified the carrying 
value of land, development and trading 
properties and the disclosures made 
in respect of unrecognised property 
development surpluses as a risk requiring 
special audit consideration.
Land, development and trading 
properties are carried in the balance sheet 
at £92 million.
Our work included, but was not limited to:
•  assessing the qualifications and experience of the Group’s internal and external, 
independent valuers and whether the basis of their valuations was consistent with 
the Group’s accounting policy as required by International Accounting Standard 2;
•  challenging the estimates, assumptions and valuation methodology used by 
management; this included challenging development profits where project 
appraisals had changed from previous years and obtaining explanations and 
supporting third-party evidence where practicable;
•  discussing with the independent valuers the basis of management’s valuations of all 
properties in excess of £2m; and
• evaluating the challenge to valuation made by the valuations Committee.
The Group’s accounting policy on land, development and trading properties is shown 
in note 38. Disclosures on investment properties are set out in note 20. Disclosures 
in respect of land, trading and development properties held by joint ventures are 
set out in note 19. The Audit Committee also identified the valuation of the land, 
development and trading properties as a key area of judgement on page 81, where 
the Committee describes how it addressed the issue.
We were satisfied that:
•  land, development and trading property valuations, and disclosures in respect 
of unrecognised surpluses, were made by suitably qualified and experienced 
management personnel and subject to challenge by the valuations Committee and 
by suitably qualified and experienced independent valuations experts; and
•  the judgements made, and assumptions used, by management in determining 
the land and development and trading property valuations were balanced and 
supported by the evidence obtained from our testing. HELICAL BAR PLC REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2016 108

EMPLOYEE REMUNERATION, 
INCLUDING CHARGES IN RESPECT OF 
THE PERFORMANCE SHARE PLAN AND 
BONUSES 
The risk: The Group operates three 
Directors’ bonus and share plans, being 
the Executive Bonus Plan 2011, the 
Helical Bar Annual Bonus Scheme 2012 
and the Performance Share Plan (“PSP”). 
Determining the charge in respect of 
the PSP in accordance with International 
Financial Reporting Standard 2 involves 
complex calculations and elements of 
management judgement. The key inputs 
to the bonus calculations are the results 
of the Group and the performance of the 
property portfolio, the latter of which is 
considered to be an area of significant 
management judgement and estimation.
We therefore identified employee 
remuneration, including charges in 
respect of the Performance Share Plan 
and Bonuses as a risk requiring special 
audit consideration.
Our work included, but was not limited to:
•  confirming that calculation methodologies adopted are in accordance with the 
Schemes’ rules;
•  challenging the fair value assumptions in respect of options at the grant date 
by reference to independent valuations commissioned by management and an 
independent assessment by our own share valuation experts;
•  challenging management judgements over key inputs into the bonus calculations 
and PSP charge, including assumptions with regard to future vesting;
•  meeting with the Chairman of the Remuneration Committee to evaluate areas of 
management judgement; and
•  confirming that Directors salaries, as set out in the Directors’ Remuneration 
Report, have been approved.
The Group’s accounting policy in respect of share based payments is shown in note 
38. Disclosures in respect of Employee and Directors’ Remuneration are set out in 
note 8 and the Directors’ Remuneration Report on pages 83 to 102.
We were satisfied that:
• Directors’ salaries were approved;
• bonus calculations were made in accordance with the Schemes’ rules; and
•  the judgement made by management in respect of the Helical Bar Annual Bonus 
Scheme 2012 accrual included in the income statement and balance sheet was 
calculated around the mid-point of likely outcomes. This judgement did not affect 
the Directors’ emoluments set out in the Directors’ Remuneration Report.  HELICAL BAR PLC REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2016 109 GOVERNANCE
INDEPENDENT AuDITOR’S REPORT 
OUR APPLICATION OF MATERIALITY AND AN 
OVERVIEW OF THE SCOPE OF OUR AUDIT
MATERIALITY
We define materiality as the magnitude of misstatement in the 
financial statements that makes it probable that the economic 
decisions of a reasonably knowledgeable person would be 
changed or influenced. We use materiality in determining the 
nature, timing and extent of our audit work and in evaluating the 
results of that work. 
We determined materiality for the audit of the Group financial 
statements as a whole to be £4.858 million, which is 
approximately 1% of net assets. In determining this level of 
materiality we had regard to the Group’s status as a listed entity. 
This benchmark is considered the most appropriate because this 
is a key performance measure used by the Board of Directors to 
report to shareholders on the financial position of the Group, as 
well as being generally regarded by investors in the property 
sector as a key performance indicator. 
Materiality for the current year is at the same percentage of net 
assets as we determined for the year ended 31 March 2015 as we 
had not identified any reason for users of the accounts to change 
their view of the appropriate level of materiality.
We use a different level of materiality, performance materiality, to 
drive the extent of our testing and this was set at 75% of financial 
statement materiality for the audit of the Group financial 
statements. We also determine a lower level of specific materiality 
for certain areas such as Directors’ remuneration and related party 
transactions.
We determined the threshold at which we will communicate 
misstatements to the Audit Committee to be £242,000. In 
addition we communicate misstatements below that threshold 
that, in our view, warrant reporting on qualitative grounds.
OVERVIEW OF THE SCOPE OF OUR AUDIT
A description of the generic scope of an audit of financial 
statements is provided on the Financial Reporting Council’s 
website at www.frc.org.uk/auditscopeprivate.
We conducted our audit in accordance with International 
Standards on Auditing (uK and Ireland). Our responsibilities under 
those standards are further described in the ‘Responsibilities for 
the financial statements and the audit’ section of our report. We 
believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and 
appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.
We are independent of the Group in accordance with the Auditing 
Practices Board’s Ethical Standards for Auditors, and we have 
fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with those 
Ethical Standards.
Our audit approach was based on a thorough understanding of 
the Group’s business and is risk-based. The Group’s properties are 
spread across 134 wholly owned statutory entities and the Group’s 
21 joint ventures. The components of the Group were evaluated by 
the group audit team based on a measure of materiality, 
considering each as a percentage of total Group assets, revenues 
and profit before tax, to assess the significance of each 
component and to determine the planned audit response. For 
those components that were deemed significant either a full 
scope or targeted audit approach was determined based on their 
relative materiality to the Group and our assessment of audit risk. 
For significant components requiring a full scope approach we 
evaluated controls over the financial reporting systems identified 
as part of our risk assessment, reviewed the accounts production 
process and addressed critical accounting matters. 
In order to address the audit risks described above, as identified 
during our planning procedures, we performed a full scope audit 
of the consolidated financial statements of the Parent Company, 
Helical Bar plc, and of the financial information of the Group’s 
operations throughout the united Kingdom. Statutory audits of 
subsidiaries are performed to lower materiality where applicable.
The components that were subject to full scope audit procedures 
make up 94% of the Group’s net assets at the balance sheet date, 
100% of the Group’s revenue for the year and 58% of the Group’s 
profit before tax for the year. In total our full scope and targeted 
procedures covered 100% of the Group’s net assets at the balance 
sheet date, 100% of the Group’s revenue for the year and 100% of 
the Group’s profit before tax for the year. HELICAL BAR PLC REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2016 110
INDEPENDENT AuDITOR’S REPORT 
OTHER REPORTING REQUIRED BY REGULATIONS
OUR OPINION ON OTHER MATTERS PRESCRIBED BY 
THE COMPANIES ACT 2006 IS UNMODIFIED
In our opinion:  
•  the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be 
audited has been properly prepared in accordance with 
the Companies Act 2006; and 
•  the information given in the Strategic Report and Report 
of the Directors for the financial year for which the 
financial statements are prepared is consistent with the 
financial statements. 
MATTERS ON WHICH WE ARE REQUIRED TO 
REPORT BY EXCEPTION
Under the Companies Act 2006 we are required to report to you 
if, in our opinion:
•  adequate accounting records have not been kept by the Parent 
Company, or returns adequate for our audit have not been 
received from branches not visited by us; or
•  the Parent Company financial statements and the part of the 
Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited are not in 
agreement with the accounting records and returns; or
•  certain disclosures of Directors’ remuneration specified by law 
are not made; or
•  we have not received all the information and explanations we 
require for our audit.
Under the Listing Rules, we are required to review:
•  the Directors’ statements in relation to going concern and 
longer-term viability set out on pages 61 and 77; and
•  the part of the Corporate Governance Statement relating to the 
company’s compliance with the provisions of the uK Corporate 
Governance Code specified for our review.
Under the International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland) 
we are required to report to you if, in our opinion, information in 
the annual report is:
•  materially inconsistent with the information in the audited 
financial statements; or
•  apparently materially incorrect based on, or materially 
inconsistent with, our knowledge of the Group acquired in the 
course of performing our audit; or
•  otherwise misleading.
In particular, we are required to report to you if: 
•  we have identified any inconsistencies between our knowledge 
acquired during the audit and the Directors’ statement that 
they consider the annual report is fair, balanced and 
understandable; or
•  the annual report does not appropriately disclose those matters 
that were communicated to the Audit Committee which we 
consider should have been disclosed.
We have nothing to report in respect of any of the above matters.
We also confirm that we do not have anything material to add or 
to draw attention to in relation to:
•  the Directors’ confirmation in the annual report that they have 
carried out a robust assessment of the principal risks facing the 
Group including those that would threaten its business model, 
future performance, solvency or liquidity;
•  the disclosures in the annual report that describe those risks 
and explain how they are being managed or mitigated;
•  the Directors’ statement in the financial statements about 
whether they have considered it appropriate to adopt the going 
concern basis of accounting in preparing them, and their 
identification of any material uncertainties to the Group’s ability 
to continue to do so over a period of at least twelve months 
from the date of approval of the financial statements; and
•  the Directors’ explanation in the annual report as to how they 
have assessed the prospects of the Group, over what period 
they have done so and why they consider that period to be 
appropriate, and their statement as to whether they have a 
reasonable expectation that the Group will be able to continue 
in operation and meet its liabilities as they fall due over the 
period of their assessment, including any related disclosures 
drawing attention to any necessary qualifications or 
assumptions.
RESPONSIBILITIES FOR THE FINANCIAL 
STATEMENTS AND THE AUDIT
What the Directors are responsible for: 
As explained more fully in the Statement of Directors’ 
Responsibilities set out on page 105, the Directors are responsible 
for the preparation of the financial statements and for being 
satisfied that they give a true and fair view. 
What we are responsible for:
Our responsibility is to audit and express an opinion on the 
financial statements in accordance with applicable law and

to those segments and to assess their performance. The Group divides its business into the following segments:
•  Investment properties, which are owned or leased by the Group for long-term income and for capital appreciation, and Trading 
properties which are owned or leased with the intention to sell; and,

Note: all deferred tax balances have been calculated at an effective rate of corporation tax of 19% which is the average of the substantively enacted future 
rates for the periods in which the deferred tax is expected to be realised.
Factors that may affect future tax charges
The tax charge is expected to be less than the full rate in future years, primarily due to the Group continuing to claim allowances in 
respect of eligible expenditure on investment properties.

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
11.  DEFERRED TAX CONTINUED
Other temporary differences include deferred tax assets arising from the recognition of the fair value of derivative financial instruments 
and future tax relief available to the Group from capital allowances and when share awards vest. A debit of £3,002,000 (2015: credit of 
£2,477,000) in respect of future tax relief for share awards has been recognised in reserves in accordance with IAS 12.
The Group contains entities with tax losses for which no deferred tax asset is recognised. The total unrecognised losses amount to 
approximately £9,026,000 (2015: £9,036,000). A deferred tax asset has not been recognised because the entities in which the losses have 
been generated either do not have forecast taxable profits or the losses have restrictions whereby their utilisation is considered to be unlikely.
If upon sale of the investment properties the Group retained all the capital allowances, the deferred tax provision in respect of capital 
allowances of £1,946,000 (2015: £1,561,000) would be released and further capital allowances of £20,340,000 (2015: £18,031,000) would 
be available to reduce future tax liabilities.

13.  PARENT COMPANY
The Company has taken advantage of Section 408 of the Companies Act 2006 and has not included its own income statement in the 
financial statements. The profit for the year of the Company was £11,344,000 (2015: loss of £1,316,000).
14.  EARNINGS PER SHARE
The calculation of the basic earnings per share is based on the earnings attributable to ordinary shareholders divided by the weighted 
average number of shares in issue during the year. This is a different basis to the net asset per share calculations which are based on the 
number of shares at the year end. Shares held by the ESOP, which has waived its entitlement to receive dividends, are treated as 
cancelled for the purposes of this calculation.
The calculation of diluted earnings per share is based on the basic earnings per share, adjusted to allow for the effect of all dilutive 
options and awards.
The earnings per share are calculated in accordance with IAS 33, Earnings per Share and the best practice recommendations of the European Public 
Real Estate Association (“EPRA ”). Reconciliations of the earnings and weighted average number of shares used in the calculations are set out below.

Interest capitalised in respect of the refurbishment of investment properties is included in investment properties to the extent of 
£6,571,000 (2015: £5,449,000).
Investment properties with a total fair value of £945,400,000 (2015: £628,621,000) were held as security against borrowings.
All of the Group’s properties are level 3, as defined by IFRS 13 Fair Value Measurement, in the fair value hierarchy as at 31 March 2016 and there 
were no transfers between levels during the year. Level 3 inputs used in valuing the properties, are those which are unobservable, as opposed 
to level 1 (inputs from quoted prices) and level 2 (observable inputs either directly, i.e. as prices, or indirectly, i.e. derived from prices).
Transfers into and transfers out of the fair value hierarchy levels are recognised on the date of the event or change in circumstances that 
caused the transfer. There were no transfers in or out of Level 3 for investment properties during the year.
Valuation methodology
The fair value of the Group’s investment property as at 31 March 2016 was determined by independent external valuers at that date, except 
for investment properties valued by the Directors. The valuations are in accordance with the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors 
(‘RICS’) Valuation – Professional Standards (“The Red Book”) and the International Valuation Standards and were arrived at by reference to 
market transactions for similar properties. Fair values for investment properties are calculated using the present value income approach. 
The main assumptions underlying the valuations are in relation to rent profile and yields as discussed below. A key driver of the property 
valuations is the terms of the leases in place at the valuation date. These determine the cash flow profile of the property for a number of 
years. The valuation assumes adjustments from these rental values to current market rent at the time of the next rent review (where a 
typical lease allows only for upward adjustment) and as leases expire and are replaced by new leases. The current market level of rent is 
assessed based on evidence provided by the most recent relevant leasing transactions and negotiations. The nominal equivalent yield is 
applied as a discount rate to the rental cash flows which, after taking into account other input assumptions such as vacancies and costs, 
generates the market value of the property. The equivalent yield applied is assessed by reference to market transactions for similar 
properties and takes into account, amongst other things, any risks associated with the rent uplift assumptions. HELICAL BAR PLC REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2016 123
NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
 
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
15.  INVESTMENT PROPERTIES CONTINUED
The net initial yield is calculated as the current net income over the gross market value of the asset and is used as a sense check and to 
compare against market transactions for similar properties. The valuation output, along with inputs and assumptions, are reviewed to 
ensure these are in line with what a market participant would use when pricing each asset.
The reversionary yield is the return received from an asset once the estimated rental value has been captured on today’s assessment of 
market value.
There are interrelationships between all the inputs as they are determined by market conditions. The existence of an increase in more 
than one input would be to magnify the input on the valuation. The impact on the valuation will be mitigated by the interrelationship of 
two inputs in opposite directions.
Details of the investment portfolio yields can be found on page 48 of this report.
The graph below illustrates the sensitivity of the value of the investment portfolio to the reversionary yield.

* Under the Barts Square joint venture agreement the Group is entitled to varying returns dependent upon the performance of the development. Whilst 
the Group holds a 33.35% equity share in the Barts Square group, it has accounted for its share at 43.8% to reflect its expected economic interest in the 
joint venture. This has changed from the 33.35% interest shown at 31 March 2015, and resulted in a gain of £6,341,000 being recognised in the 
Consolidated Income Statement to reflect the Group’s increased share in the opening net assets of the joint venture.
The cost of the Company’s investment in joint ventures was £15,000 (2015: £15,000). 
The Directors’ valuation of the trading and development stock shows a surplus of £7,000,000 above book value (2015: £11,013,000). HELICAL BAR PLC REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2016 126

Significant Judgements and Estimates 
There are a number of companies which are accounted for as joint ventures where the Group has an equity interest of less than 50%. 
This typically occurs where the Group’s joint venture partner is providing a greater share of finance into the Company, with the Group 
contributing a greater share towards the day to day management of the underlying project. In these cases neither party has control over 
the entity and therefore it is considered appropriate to account for our interest as a joint venture. 
Dividends of £82,569,000 were received from joint venture companies during the year (2015: £17,013,000). The joint venture companies 
are private companies, therefore no quoted market prices are available for their shares. 
At 31 March 2015, the Group had an investment in Helical Sosnica Sp. Zoo, which had been accounted for as an investment held for sale 
due to a commitment to sell the Group’s share. At 31 March 2015 Helical Sosnica Sp. zoo held a development property, the fair value of 
which the Directors believed to be £81,866,000 (of which Helical’s share was £40,933,000) and a bank loan of £51,156,000 (of which 
Helical’s share was £25,578,000) repayable in September 2017. During the year, the Group sold its investment in Helical Sosnica Sp.Zoo.
During the year, Old Street Holdings LP sold its investments in 207 Old Street Unit Trust, 211 Old Street Unit Trust, Old Street Retail Unit 
Trust and City Road Jersey Limited. The Group purchased the trust capital of 207 Old Street Unit Trust and 211 Old Street Unit Trust from 
Old Street Holdings LP.
During the year, Barts Two Limited sold its investment in Barts Two Investment Property Limited.
Under the Barts Square joint venture agreement the Group is entitled to varying returns dependent upon the performance of the 
development. Whilst the Group holds a 33.35% legal share in the Barts Square group, it has accounted for its share at 43.8% to reflect its 
expected economic interest in the joint venture. This has changed from the 33.35% interest shown at 31 March 2015, and resulted in a 
gain of £6,341,000 being recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement to reflect the Group’s increased share in the opening net 
assets of the joint venture.

In the year to 31 March 2015, the Group assigned its forward purchase contract on Clifton Street, London EC2 to a third party. The agreement 
to assign the forward purchase contract was considered to be a derivative financial instrument. As such, under IAS 39, it was carried at 
its fair value with gains and losses taken to the Income Statement. Cash of £17.3m was received during the year to 31 March 2016.

Impairment in the year (1,370) (773)
At 31 March 3,114 4,342
Included within available-for-sale investments is an amount lent to a company promoting a mainly residential mixed-use development 
and a holding of 20% of the equity of this company.
The loan and the equity are together classed as an available-for-sale investment and held at fair value. It is considered to be Level 3 of 
the IFRS 13 fair value hierarchy. The Group has determined its fair value by considering both the loan and the equity element separately. 
The loan element is valued at the fair value of the expected consideration to be received including anticipated future costs of recovering 
this loan. This amount has been impaired in the year due to a revision in the expected receipt. The value of the available-for-sale 
investment is 100% sensitive to changes in the expected repayment proceeds. The equity element is given a £nil value with the Group 
valuing the underlying company on a break up basis at £nil as it is believed that this is the most probable outcome. This £nil valuation is 
derived because the Group believe that the value of the property and any other of the company’s assets, after the repayment of the loan 
payable to the Group, would be required to repay the outstanding creditors leaving negligible value to the shareholders.
The Group does not consider that it has significant influence over this company despite having 20% of the equity as another party owns 
a majority shareholding and the Group does not have a representative on the board of the company.
The decline in value of £1,370,000 (2015: £773,000) has been recognised in the Income Statement.

The year on year changes in fixed borrowing rates are the result of stepped increases/decreases in interest rate swaps rates. Floating 
rate borrowings bear interest at rates based on LIBOR.
At 31 March 2016 the Company had £30,000,000 (2015: £30,000,000) and £20,300,000 (2015: £11,100,000) interest rate swaps, both at 
4.070% and expiring in July 2019 and October 2017 respectively. Interest is fixed on the retail bond and convertible bond as shown 
above, with the remaining borrowings being at floating rates. 
In addition to the above, the Group has a £50,000,000 interest rate swap at 1.865% starting in January 2020 and expiring in June 2026. HELICAL BAR PLC REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2016 131

28.  SHARE CAPITAL CONTINUED
Capital Management
The Group’s capital management objectives are:
-  to ensure the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern; and, 
-  to provide an adequate return to shareholders.
The Group sets the amount of capital in proportion to its overall financing structure. It manages the capital structure and makes 
adjustments to it in the light of changes in economic conditions and the risk characteristics of the underlying assets. In order to maintain 
or adjust the capital structure, the Group may adjust the amount of dividends paid to shareholders, return capital to shareholders, issue 
new shares, or sell assets to reduce debt. Capital is defined as being issued share capital, share premium, retained earnings, revaluation 
reserve and other reserves (2016: £478,711,000; 2015: £396,825,000). The Group continually monitors its gearing level to ensure that it is 
appropriate. Gearing increased from 118% to 136% in the year as the Group took advantage of favourable debt market conditions.
The deferred shares were issued on 23 December 2004 to those shareholders electing to receive a dividend, rather than a capital 
repayment or further shares in the Company, as part of the Return of Cash approved by shareholders on 20 December 2004. The 
deferred shares carry no voting rights and have no right to a dividend or capital payment in the event of a winding up of the Company. 
The Company’s Articles of Association give the Company irrevocable authority to purchase all or any of the deferred shares for a 
maximum aggregate total of 1 penny for all deferred shares in issue on the date of such purchase.
29.  SHARE OPTIONS
At 31 March 2016 and 31 March 2015 there were no unexercised options over new ordinary 1p shares in the Company. No options over 
purchased ordinary 1p shares held by the ESOP had been granted to directors and employees under the Company’s share option 
schemes (31 March 2015: none). 
The Company uses a stochastic valuation model to value the share options.

30.  SHARE-BASED PAYMENTS
The Group provides share-based payments to employees in the form of performance share plan awards and a share incentive plan. The 
Company uses a stochastic valuation model and the resulting value is amortised through the Income Statement over the vesting period 
of the share-based payments.

The fair value of the awards made in the year to 31 March 2016 was £5,802,000 (2015: £6,305,000).
The inputs into the stochastic model of valuation of the PSP awards made in the year to 31 March 2016 were as follows:

The Group recognised a charge of £6,666,000 (2015: £6,432,000) during the year in relation to share-based payments.
Volatility is measured by calculating the standard deviation of the natural logarithm of share price movements for the period prior to the 
date of grant which is commensurate with the remaining length of the performance period.
At the balance sheet date there were no exercisable awards. HELICAL BAR PLC REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2016 133

36.  FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS CONTINUED
The carrying value of trade and other payables and borrowings is not deemed to be materially different from the fair value. Financial 
liabilities are stated in accordance with IAS 32.
The Group and Company financial instruments that are measured subsequent to initial recognition at fair value are available-for-sale 
assets, forward exchange contracts and interest rate swaps, caps and floors, and those designated on initial recognition. 
Forward foreign exchange contracts are externally measured using quoted forward exchange rates and yield curves derived from 
quoted interest rates matching maturities of the contracts. Interest rate swaps, caps and floors are measured at the present value of 
future cash flows estimated and discounted based on the applicable yield curves derived from quoted interest rates. 
IFRS 13 categorises financial assets and liabilities as being valued in 3 hierarchical levels:
-  Level 1: values are unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities 
-  Level 2: values are derived from observing market data 
-  Level 3: values cannot be derived from observable market data
Assets and liabilities measured at fair value are classified as below:
Level 1 Convertible bond (note 26)
Level 2 Derivative financial instruments (note 27)
Property derivative financial asset (note 21)
Level 3 Available-for-sale investment (note 22)
Investment property (note 15)

£7,999,000), of which a gain of £nil (2015: £16,388,000) was due to the property derivative financial asset and a loss of £6,860,000 
(2015: £8,389,000) was due to interest rate caps and swaps. In accordance with IAS 39, the convertible bond is split into a loan and 
derivative element in the Company Balance Sheet. On initial recognition the derivative element had a value of £8,190,000. At 31 March 
2016, the derivative element had a value of £7,134,000 (2015: £9,182,000) with a corresponding gain of £2,048,000 (2015: loss of 
£992,000) recognised in the Income Statement. The movement in the Company’s interest rate swaps in the year was a gain of 
£1,898,000 (2015: loss of £2,021,000).
Credit risk
Credit risks arise from the possibility that customers may not be able to settle their obligations as agreed. To manage this risk the Group 
periodically assesses the financial reliability of customers, taking into account their financial position, past experience and other factors. 
As at 31 March 2016 the Group had total credit risk exposure excluding cash of £58,004,000 of which £3,114,000 is available-for-sale 
assets and £54,890,000 is loans and receivables. Available-for-sale assets are analysed in note 22. The cash is held with reputable 
banking institutions and in client accounts with solicitors and managing agents and therefore credit risk is considered low.
All other debtors are deemed to be recoverable.
All Company debtors are considered to be fully recoverable.
The Group is not reliant on any major customer for its ability to continue as a going concern.
For further information on trade and other receivables, see note 23.
Liquidity risk
Liquidity risk is defined as the risk that the Group would not be able to settle or meet its obligations on time or at a reasonable price. 
Liquidity and funding risks, related processes and policies are overseen by management.
The Group manages its liquidity risk on a consolidated basis based on business needs, tax, capital or regulatory considerations, if 
applicable, and through numerous sources of finance in order to maintain flexibility. Management monitors the Group’s net liquidity 
position through rolling forecasts on the basis of expected cash flows. The Group’s cash and cash equivalents are held with major 
regulated financial institutions and the directors regularly monitor the financial institutions that the group uses to ensure its exposure to 
liquidity risk is minimised.

Total contracted liabilities 912,418 750,655 211,217 237,038
At 31 March 2016 the Group had £83,641,000 (2015: £54,130,000) of undrawn borrowing facilities, £105,865,000 (2015: £81,530,000) of 
uncharged property assets and cash balances of £74,670,000 (2015 £120,993,000). The above contracted liabilities assume that no 
loans are extended beyond their current facility expiry date. Management believe that these facilities, together with anticipated sales and 
the renewal of some of these loan facilities, mean that the Group can meet its contracted liabilities as they fall due.
Market risk
The Group is exposed to market risk, primarily related to interest rates, foreign currency exchange movements, the market value of the 
investments and accrued development profits. The Group actively monitors these exposures.
Interest rate risk
It is the Group’s policy and practice to minimise interest rate cash flow exposures on long-term financing. The Group does this by using a 
number of derivative financial instruments including interest rate swaps and interest rate caps. The purpose of these derivatives is to 
manage the interest rate risks arising from the Group’s sources of finance. The Group does not use financial instruments for speculative 
purposes.
Details of financing and financial instruments can be found in note 27.
In the year to 31 March 2016, if interest rates had moved by 0.5%, this would have resulted in the following movement to net profits and 
equity due to movements in interest charges and mark-to-market valuations of derivatives.

Foreign currency exchange risk
Due to its operations in Poland and its investment in a non-UK based property developer, the Group has exposure to exchange 
movements on foreign currencies. Management monitors its exposure to risks associated with foreign currency exchange risk and 
reviews any requirements to act to minimise these risks.
In the year to 31 March 2016 the Group made foreign exchange gains of £100,000 (2015: losses of £2,061,000) resulting from movements 
in foreign exchange rates during the year affecting its assets and liabilities related to its overseas operations.

37.  POST BALANCE SHEET EVENTS
There were no material post balance sheet events.
38. PRINCIPAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES 
Basis of consolidation 
The Group financial statements consolidate those of Helical Bar plc (the “Company”) and all of its subsidiary undertakings (together the 
“Group”) drawn up to 31 March 2016. Subsidiary undertakings are entities for which the Group is exposed to variable returns and has the 
ability to control those returns. Subsidiaries are accounted for under the purchase method and are held in the Company balance sheet 
at cost and reviewed annually for impairment.
Joint Ventures are entities whose economic activities are controlled jointly by the Group and by other ventures independent of the 
Group, where both parties are exposed to variable returns but neither has control over those returns. They are accounted for using the 
equity method of accounting, whereby the Group’s share of profit after tax in the Joint Venture is recognised in the Consolidated 
Income Statement and the Group’s share of the Joint Venture’s net assets are incorporated in the Consolidated Balance Sheet.
The Company’s cost of investment in Joint Ventures less any provision for permanent impairment loss is shown in the Company Balance 
Sheet.
Associates are those entities over which the Group has significant influence but which are neither subsidiaries nor joint ventures. 
Intra-group balances and any unrealised gains on transactions between the Company and its subsidiaries and between subsidiaries are 
eliminated. Unrealised losses are also eliminated unless the transaction provides evidence of an impairment of the asset transferred.
Going concern
The accounts have been prepared on a going concern basis as explained in the Governance Review on page 77.
Revenue recognition 
Rental income – rental income receivable is recognised in the Income Statement on a straight line basis over the lease term. Any 
incentive for lessees to enter into a lease agreement and any costs associated with entering into the lease are spread over the same 
period.
Sale of goods – assets, such as trading properties, development sites and completed developments, are regarded as sold upon the 
transfer of the significant risks and rewards of ownership to the purchaser, in accordance with IAS 18 Revenue. This occurs on exchange 
of unconditional contracts for the sale of the site, on satisfaction of any and all conditions on a conditional contract for the sale of the 
site or on completion of the contract on a conditional sale where those conditions are satisfied at completion. Measurements of revenue 
arising from the sale of such assets are derived from the fair value of the consideration received in accordance with IAS 18 Revenue.
Construction contracts – where an asset is constructed under a specific contract with a purchaser (a “pre-sold development”) the initial 
sale of the site to that purchaser is recognised as a sale of goods in accordance with IAS 18 Revenue, where the sale of the land is not 
conditional on the construction of the buildings and is not reversible in the event that the building is not constructed. The construction 
element of the contract is treated, for the purposes of revenue recognition, as a construction contract in accordance with IAS 11 
Construction Contracts. Revenue is recognised by reference to the stage of completion which is typically determined by reference to 
project appraisals, normally supported by independent valuation certificates provided by quantity surveyors. The Company’s principal 
other responsibility on pre-sold developments is the identification of and agreement of terms with potential tenants of the completed 
building(s). The revenue recognition of this additional component of the funding agreements is considered separately to reflect the 
substance of the transaction as the rendering of services, in accordance with IAS 18 Revenue. The amount of revenue recognised is 
determined by reference to the percentage of the building(s) that are let. 
Property advisory/development management services – where the Group provides these services to the third party property site owner 
the Group recognises income over the period these services are provided and in accordance with the specific terms of the contract. If 
the amount and payment of the consideration for these services are contingent upon a future event (such as sale of the property) and if 
the fair value of the consideration can be reliably estimated, the Group recognises this income as its services are performed, discounting 
for time and risk if appropriate.
Investment income – revenue in respect of investment and other income represents investment income, fees and commissions earned 
on an accruals basis and the fair value of the consideration received/receivable on investments held for the short-term. Dividends are 
recognised when the shareholders’ right to receive payment has been established. Interest income is accrued on a time basis, by 
reference to the principal outstanding and the effective interest rate.
Deferred income – money received in advance of the provision of goods or services is held in the balance sheet until the income can be 
recognised in the Income Statement.
Share-based payments 
The Group provides share-based payments in the form of performance share plan awards and a share incentive plan. These payments 
are discussed in greater detail in the Directors’ Remuneration Report on pages 83 to 102. The fair value of share-based payments related 
to employees’ service are determined indirectly by reference to the fair value of the related instrument at the grant date. The Group uses 
the stochastic valuation model and the resulting value is amortised through the Consolidated Income Statement (“Income Statement”) 
over the vesting period of the share-based payments.
For the performance share plan and share incentive plan awards, where non-market conditions apply, the expense is allocated, over the 
vesting period, to the Income Statement based on the best available estimate of the number of awards that are expected to vest. 
Estimates are subsequently revised if there is any indication that the number of awards expected to vest differs from previous estimates.
The amount charged to the Income Statement is credited to the Retained Earnings reserve. HELICAL BAR PLC REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2016 139

Depreciation 
In accordance with IAS 40 Investment Property, depreciation is not provided for on freehold investment properties or on leasehold 
investment properties. The Group does not own the freehold land and buildings which it occupies. Costs incurred in respect of leasehold 
improvements to the Group’s head office at 5 Hanover Square, London W1S 1HQ are capitalised and held as short-term leasehold 
improvements. Leasehold improvements, plant and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and any recognised 
impairment loss. Residual values are reassessed annually.
Depreciation is charged so as to write off the cost of assets less residual value, over their estimated useful lives, using the straight line 
method, on the following basis:
Short leasehold improvements - 10% or length of lease, if shorter 
Plant and equipment  - 25%
Taxation 
The taxation charge represents the sum of tax currently payable and deferred tax. The charge for current taxation is based on the results 
for the year as adjusted for items which are non-assessable or disallowed. It is calculated using rates that have been enacted or 
substantively enacted by the balance sheet date. Tax payable upon realisation of revaluation gains recognised in prior periods is 
recorded as a current tax charge with a release of the associated deferred taxation.
Deferred tax is the tax expected to be payable or recoverable on differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in 
the financial statements and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable profit, and is accounted for using the 
balance sheet liability method. 
Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised for all taxable temporary differences and deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent 
that it is probable that taxable profits will be available against which deductible temporary differences can be utilised. The measurement 
of deferred tax assets and liabilities reflects the tax consequences of the manner in which the Group expects, at the balance sheet date, 
to recover or settle the carrying amount of those assets and liabilities. Such assets and liabilities are not recognised if the temporary 
differences arise from the initial recognition of goodwill or from the initial recognition (other than in a business combination) of other 
assets and liabilities in a transaction that affects neither the tax profit nor the accounting profit.
The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each balance sheet date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer 
probable that sufficient taxable profits will be available to allow all or part of the assets to be recovered.
The deferred tax asset relating to share based payment awards reflects the estimated value of tax relief available on the vesting of the 
awards at the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is determined using tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date and are expected 
to apply when the related deferred tax asset is realised or the deferred tax liability is settled. It is recognised in the Income Statement 
except when it relates to items credited or charged directly to equity, in which case the deferred tax is also dealt with in equity.
The Group recognises a deferred tax liability for all taxable temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries, associates 
and interests in joint ventures, except to the extent that both of the following conditions are satisfied:
a) the Group is able to control the timing of the reversal of the temporary difference; and,
b) it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
Dividends 
Dividend distributions to the Company’s shareholders are recognised as a liability in the financial statements in the period in which 
dividends are approved.
Investment properties 
Investment properties are properties owned or leased by the Group which are held for long-term rental income and for capital 
appreciation. Investment properties are initially recognised at cost, including associated transaction costs, and revalued at the balance 
sheet date to fair value. These fair values are based on market values as determined by professionally qualified external valuers or are 
determined by the directors of the Group based on their knowledge of the property. In accordance with IAS 40, investment properties 
held under leases are stated gross of the recognised finance lease liability.
Gains or losses arising from changes in the fair value of investment properties are recognised as gains or losses on revaluation in the 
Income Statement of the period in which they arise.
In accordance with IAS 40, as the Group uses the fair value model, no depreciation is provided in respect of investment properties 
including integral plant.
Property that is being constructed or developed for future use as an investment property is treated as investment property in 
accordance with IAS 40. 
When the Group redevelops an existing investment property for continued future use as investment property, the property remains an 
investment property measured at fair value and is not reclassified. Interest is capitalised before tax relief until the date of practical 
completion.
Details of the valuation of investment properties can be found in note 15. HELICAL BAR PLC REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2016 140
NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
 
38. PRINCIPAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED
Land, developments and trading properties
Land, developments and trading properties held for sale are inventory and are included in the Balance Sheet at the lower of cost and net 
realisable value. Net realisable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business less estimated costs to completion 
and estimated costs necessary to make the sale.
Gross borrowing costs associated with expenditure on properties under development or undergoing major refurbishment are 
capitalised. The interest capitalised is either based on the interest paid (where a project has a specific loan) or calculated using the 
Group’s weighted average cost of borrowings (where there are no specific borrowings for the project). Interest is capitalised from the 
date of commencement of the development work until date of practical completion. 
Investments 
Available-for-sale investments are revalued to fair value at the balance sheet date. Gains or losses arising from changes in fair value are 
recognised in the Statement of Comprehensive Income except to the extent that losses are attributable to impairment below historic 
cost, in which case they are recognised in the Income Statement. Upon disposal, accumulated fair value adjustments are included in the 
Income Statement. 
Held for sale investments 
Investments are defined as held for sale when the Group intends to sell the investment and if sale is highly probable. Such held for sale 
investments are measured at the lower of their carrying amounts immediately prior to their classification as held for sale and their fair 
value less costs to sell. 
Trade receivables 
Trade receivables do not carry any interest and are stated initially at fair value and subsequently at amortised cost as reduced by 
appropriate allowances for estimated irrecoverable amounts.
Cash and cash equivalents 
Cash and cash equivalents are carried in the Balance Sheet at amortised cost. For the purposes of the cash flow statement, cash and 
cash equivalents comprise cash in hand, deposits with banks, cash held at solicitors, cash in blocked accounts and other short-term, 
highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less.
Trade and other payables 
Trade and other payables are not interest bearing and are initially recognised at fair value and subsequently at amortised cost.
Borrowing and borrowing costs 
Interest bearing bank loans and overdrafts and the Group’s retail bond are initially recorded at fair value, net of finance and other costs 
yet to be amortised in accordance with IAS39. Embedded derivatives contained within the borrowing agreements are treated in 
accordance with IAS39, which includes consideration of whether embedded derivatives require bifurcation. The retail bond and bank 
loans are held at amortised cost.
Convertible bonds are designated as fair value through the profit and loss and so are presented on the Balance Sheet at fair value, with 
all gains and losses, including the write-off of issuance costs, recognised in the Income Statement. The interest charge in respect of the 
coupon rate on the bonds has been recognised within Finance Costs on an accruals basis. 
Borrowing costs directly attributable to the acquisition and construction of new developments and investment properties are added to 
the costs of such properties until the date of completion of the development or investment. After initial recognition borrowings are 
carried at amortised cost. This treatment has been adopted since transition to IFRS.
Gains or losses on extinguishing debt are recognised in the Income Statement in the period in which they occur.
Derivative financial instruments 
Derivative financial assets and financial liabilities are recognised on the Balance Sheet when the Group becomes a party to the 
contractual provisions of the instrument.
The Group enters into derivative transactions such as interest rate swaps, caps and floors, and forward foreign currency contracts in 
order to manage the risks arising from its activities. Derivatives are initially recorded at fair value and are subsequently remeasured to 
fair value based on market prices, estimated future cash flows and forward rates as appropriate. Any change in the fair value of such 
derivatives is recognised immediately in the Income Statement.
A derivative property asset is recognised on the Balance Sheet when the Group has contractually assigned an existing purchase 
contract. A derivative property asset is initially recorded at its fair value and is remeasured at each reporting period date to its fair value, 
which is based upon the future contracted cash flow discounted for both time and risk. Any change in fair value is recognised in the 
Income Statement as a development profit.
Further information on the categorisation of financial instruments can be found in note 36.
Leases 
Leases are classified according to the substance of the transaction. A lease that transfers substantially all the risks and rewards of 
ownership to the lessee is classified as a finance lease. All other leases are classified as operating leases.
In accordance with IAS 40, finance leases of investment property are accounted for as finance leases and recognised as an asset and an 
obligation to pay future minimum lease payments. The investment property asset is included in the Balance Sheet at fair value, gross of 
the recognised finance lease liability. Lease payments are allocated between the liability and finance charges so as to achieve a constant 
financing rate.
In accordance with IAS17, operating leases receipts and payments are spread on a straight-line basis over the length of the lease. HELICAL BAR PLC REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2016 141

Foreign currencies 
Transactions in foreign currencies are translated at the exchange rate ruling at the date of the transaction. Monetary assets and liabilities 
in foreign currencies are translated at the rates of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date. Non-monetary items that are measured at 
historical cost in a foreign currency are translated at the exchange rate at the date of the transaction. 
Any exchange differences arising on the settlement of monetary items or on translating monetary items at rates different from those at 
which they were initially recorded are recognised in the Income Statement in the period in which they arise. Exchange differences on 
non-monetary items are recognised in the Statement of Comprehensive Income to the extent that they relate to a gain or loss on that 
non-monetary item which is included in the Statement of Comprehensive Income, otherwise such gains and losses are recognised in the 
Income Statement. 
The assets and liabilities in the financial statements of foreign subsidiaries are translated at the rate of exchange ruling at the balance 
sheet date. Income and expenses are translated at the average rate. The exchange differences arising from the retranslation of the 
opening net investment in subsidiaries are recognised in Other Comprehensive Income. On disposal of a foreign operation the 
cumulative translation differences (including, if applicable, gains and losses on related hedges) are transferred to the Income Statement 
as part of the gain or loss on disposal. 
Net asset values per share 
Net asset values per share have been calculated in accordance with the best practice recommendations of the European Public Real 
Estate Association (“EPRA”).
Earnings per share 
Earnings per share have been calculated in accordance with IAS 33 and the best practice recommendations of EPRA.
Employee Share Ownership Plan Trust 
Shares held in the Helical Bar Employee Share Ownership Plan Trust (“ESOP”) are shown as a deduction in arriving at equity funds on 
consolidation. Assets, liabilities and reserves of the ESOP are included in the statutory headings to which they relate. Purchases and 
sales of own shares increase or decrease the book value of “Own shares held” in the Balance Sheet. At each period end the Group 
assesses and recognises the value of “Own shares held” with reference to the expected cash proceeds and accounts for any difference 
as a reserves transfer.
Use of estimates and judgements 
To be able to prepare accounts according to the accounting principles, management must make estimates and assumptions that affect 
the asset and liability items and revenue and expense amounts recorded in the financial statements. These estimates are based on 
historical experience and various other assumptions that management and the Board of Directors believe are reasonable under the 
circumstances. The results of these considerations form the basis for making judgements about the carrying value of assets and 
liabilities that are not readily available from other sources.
Areas requiring the use of estimates and critical judgement that may significantly impact on the Group’s earnings and financial position are:
Estimates
-  Recognition of share-based payments which is dependent upon the estimated number of performance share plan awards that will 
vest at the end of the periods based on future forecast performance and employee retention (note 30);
- The provision for future bonuses payable under the Annual Bonus scheme (note 8);
-  Valuation of investment properties, including Directors’ valuations and where external valuers are used to provide third party 
valuations (note 15); and
-  Directors’ valuation of land, development and trading properties include subjective assumptions including the results of future 
planning decisions, future construction costs and future sales values and timings (note 20).
Judgements
-  Calculation and assessment of the recoverability of deferred tax assets, where it has been assumed that sufficient taxable profits will 
be available in future periods to allow all of the assets to be recovered (note 11);
- An assessment of the most suitable accounting treatment for convertible bonds (note 26);
-  Consideration of the nature of joint arrangements. In the context of IFRS 10, this involves consideration of where the control lies and 
whether either party has the power to vary its returns from the arrangements. In particular, significant judgement is exercised where 
the shareholding of the Group is not 50% (note 19); and
-  Consideration of whether an investment property purchase that has exchanged but not completed should be recognised as 
investment property under IAS 40. The judgement lies in assessing whether the exchange is unconditional, in which case it is 
recognised (note 15).
-  Determination of the most appropriate percentage interest in our Joint Ventures to equity account for, where our economic interest 
can differ to our ownership interest (see note 19).
-  Recognition of development management service income, where payment for these services is triggered by a future event (sale or 
letting of the property) and where estimation is required to determine the stage of completion. HELICAL BAR PLC REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2016 142

Unsolicited investment advice – warning to shareholders
Many companies have become aware that their shareholders have 
received unsolicited phone calls or correspondence concerning 
investment matters. These are typically from overseas-based ‘brokers’ 
who target uK shareholders offering to sell them what often turn out 
to be worthless or high risk shares in uS or uK investments. They can 
be very persistent and extremely persuasive. It is not just the novice 
investor who has been duped in this way; many of the victims had 
been successfully investing for several years. Shareholders are advised 
to be very wary of any unsolicited advice, offers to buy shares at a 
discount or offers of free reports into the Company.
If you receive any unsolicited investment advice:
•  Make sure you get the correct name of the person and organisation.
•   Check that they are properly authorised by the FCA (Financial 
Conduct Authority) before getting involved.  
you can check at www.fca.org.uk/consumers.
•  Report the matter to the FCA either by calling 0800 111 6768 or 
by completing an online form at:
  w w w . f ca. or g.uk / c onsumers/ scams/in v es tment-scams/
share-fraud-and-boiler-room-scams/reporting-form.
If you deal with an unauthorised firm, you would not be eligible to 
receive payment under the Financial Services Compensation 
Scheme. Also keep in mind that some fraudsters use the name of 
genuine firms or individuals on the FCA Register to suggest that 
they are legitimate. However, authorised firms are unlikely to 
contact you out of the blue offering to buy or sell shares.

Gavin Slark Peter Warry
Group Chief Executive Chairman
Profit before tax at £44.2m (2009: £57.8m) 
was less than we would have liked but an 
excellent outcome compared to our industry 
peers in a period that has seen many stop 
paying dividends and undertake rights issues 
to repair their balance sheets. We actually 
increased sales over the year as we have 
each year throughout this recession and 
our market share has grown significantly. 
Domestic heating and plumbing is benefiting 
from early cycle recovery with strong quarter 
four performance, and is well positioned 
to grow further. The Domestic Division 
has become a major force in the industry 
from small beginnings some 10 years ago. 
During this period our Industrial Division has 
maintained its number one market position 
and has sustained a healthy operating margin. 
Our newer Specialist Division, although 
remaining profitable, has had a tougher time 
but is well placed with a number of initiatives 
that will increase revenue.
The year has seen the successful 
development of our above ground drainage 
centres in the Industrial Division and in 
February 2010 the acquisition of UGS to 
spearhead our development into below 
ground drainage. We are confident that 
these product extensions will replicate the 
success of our move into the ‘Big Pipe’ 
facility in Coventry a couple of years ago. 
In the Domestic Division the move into 
spares distribution through the acquisition 
of DHS in April 2009 has exceeded our 
profit expectations and there is considerable 
scope to grow this offering further. During 
2010 we have targeted a number of 
adjacent markets where we can develop 
profitable businesses leveraging existing 
knowledge and expertise in the Group. 
These growth opportunities utilise BSS’ 
proven skills in plumbing and heating 
distribution enabling us to reach a broader 
group of trade customers.
During the economic downturn we have 
not had the need to close a single branch 
through poor performance and during 
the year we opened a further 18 new 
branches. The Group has remained strongly 
cash generative and is conservatively 
financed with year end net debt of £85.3m 
(2009: £86.0m) after investment of £22m. 
In recognition of this strong financial 
position and the positive trends in revenue 
and earnings, the Board is pleased to 
recommend a final dividend of 6.09p per 
share (2009: 5.54p) which represents a 10% 
increase on last year.
Of course none of this would be possible 
without the effort and commitment of the 
best team in the industry, from trade counter 
to boardroom, and I would like to thank 
them all for another year of exceptional 
performance. In December 2009, we were 
delighted to announce the appointment 
of Frank Elkins, Managing Director of BSS 
Industrial to the Board.
It is difficult for companies to forecast when 
economists and politicians cannot agree 
about the economic outlook. However, the 
Group has already demonstrated its ability to 
outperform in an adverse market and, on the 
back of the recent small economic upturn, 
Group sales for the latest three month period 
(February, March and April) are 11.0% like 
for like up on the same period last year, 
This excellent result gives support to the 
Board’s belief that as the economic situation 
improves the Group’s focus on growth will 
enable it to disproportionately outperform 
any rising market.

Business Review
Chief Executive’s Statement
Q: Which are the new markets 
you have entered into?
A: We have entered into the 
drainage, renewables, spares 
markets and water industry.
Q: Can you explain the 
resilience of the Group 
compared to the industry?
A: Our revenue is primarily 
based on repair and 
maintenance with limited 
exposure to new build and 
government spend.
Q: How will you counter 
the expected downturn in 
government spend?
A: The exposure has been 
assessed and new markets 
entered to off set the potential 
downturn in spend.
Q: How does your latest 
acquisition fit in?
A: UGS extends our above ground 
drainage offer to below ground. 
UGS, an underground specialist 
business, offers BSS considerable 
scope for growth by providing 
an opportunity to expand both 
the product range and national 
coverage. 
Q: How many branches do you 
plan to open in the coming year?
A: We have opened 18 branches 
during the year and plan to  
open a similar number in the 
coming year.
Introduction
BSS has delivered sector leading results with 
revenue growth and earnings resilience despite 
the toughest year for the economy in more 
than 70 years.
The business has demonstrated its ability 
to ‘navigate the icebergs’, handling well the 
short term tactical issues, whilst remaining 
strategically strong.
The teams within the business have shown 
true strength of character, maintaining a 
positive attitude whilst having to remain  
flexible in some cases redeploying or  
reducing manpower.
The culture within the Group is a key 
component as we continue to identify new 
growth opportunities in adjacent markets whilst 
at the same time recruiting new customers and 
winning new contracts in our core businesses.
The Group is in good shape with a strong 
balance sheet and resilient revenue that 
is primarily driven by essential repair and 
maintenance activity. Revenue has held up 
well throughout the financial year as BSS 
has absorbed the worst of the recession and 
returned to growth in the fourth quarter of the 
financial year. 2009/10 has been a busy year 
for the Group: we have repositioned resources 
and reduced our cost base whilst continuing to 
invest to support a number of organic growth 
initiatives. T wo new businesses were acquired, 
DHS and UGS, and they offer tremendous 
growth potential in new markets.
The resilience of underlying revenue has been 
partly due to a keen focus on keeping close 
to our customers, serving their needs and 
recognising the pressures they faced in the 
recessionary market of 2009. Being flexible to 
changing customer requirements has been key 
to our success.
New revenue streams have taken root 
and gross margin has been supported by 
the benefits of a direct sourcing capability 
acquired with Birchwood Products in 2008. 
The leverage that Birchwood has provided in 
this area has been essential to us remaining 
competitive. Costs have been reduced as 
the business has met the challenges of a 
contracting market. Like for like employee 
numbers have been reduced by 5% as market 
circumstances have been re-assessed.
The Group remains well funded with the 
capacity, flexibility and longevity of funding 
needed to take advantage of any development 
opportunities that may arise in the near term. 
With net debt of £85.3m at year end  
(2009: £86.0m), the Group remains well 
positioned with available funding of £127m 
above year end debt. 
In conversation  
with Gavin Slark 6 7 The BSS Group plc Annual Report & Accounts 2010  The BSS Group plc Annual Report & Accounts 2010  6 7 The BSS Group plc Annual Report & Accounts 2010  The BSS Group plc Annual Report & Accounts 2010  
Strategy
Despite the recession in the wider economy 
throughout most of 2009 our strategy has 
remained unchanged; we continue to drive 
for profitable, cash generative organic 
growth in the existing businesses and 
continue to look for opportunities in adjacent 
markets where we have knowledge and 
expertise and where we believe we can add 
value. The business remains resilient as a 
specialist distributor with revenue primarily 
driven by R & M activity much of which 
is non-discretionary. Our strategic focus 
remains on four core elements: 
Consistently delivering excellent  •	
customer service 
Strong leadership and sensible  •	
business practices 
Profitable organic growth and value •	
enhancing acquisitions 
A results driven culture •	
The challenge throughout the last year has 
been to reposition BSS during a period 
of contracting markets and competitive 
pressures, to scale down resource, to 
change the mix of skills in the business 
in support of the drive into new revenue 
streams in anticipation of further change in 
the marketplace.
Gavin Slark
Group Chief Executive
The BSS Group’s Strategy 
Key Strategies:
Drive for profitable, cash generative organic growth •	
through superior service
Continue to look for opportunities in adjacent markets •	
where we have knowledge and expertise and where 
we believe we can add value
Outlook:
We are confident that 2010/1 1 will be a better year  •	
for the Group
The increase in the final dividend of 10% is •	
reflective of that confidence 8 9 The BSS Group plc Annual Report & Accounts 2010  The BSS Group plc Annual Report & Accounts 2010  8 9 The BSS Group plc Annual Report & Accounts 2010  The BSS Group plc Annual Report & Accounts 2010  
BSS is evolving at pace. There is a sense of 
urgency within the Company to reshape the 
Group to be more flexible and to recognise 
the changing needs of our customers to 
secure new market opportunities and to 
acknowledge that beyond the general 
election public finances will be tighter. 
Government funded capital expenditure 
represents about 10% of Group revenue  
but we continue to seek new growth from  
other sources and sectors that will provide 
attractive revenue opportunities that should 
more than offset the anticipated reduction  
in pubic sector investment.
New employees have joined the Group 
in the last year with skills, knowledge and 
customer relationships geared to delivering 
new revenue streams. Spares, renewables 
drainage and water generated revenue of 
£54m, year on year growth of 76%. Further 
upside in new revenue streams is targeted. 
Results
New revenue contributed to total revenue 
growth of £11.8m (0.9%) to £1,352.4m  
(2009: £1,340.6m). Group revenue in the 
second half was up 5.5% on an equivalent 
trading day basis with LFL revenue up 1.8% 
(against a 6.8% decline in the first half). 
Revenue performance in all Divisions has 
improved as the year progressed, with the 
Domestic Division benefiting from early cycle 
recovery in the broader economy. Core 
repair and maintenance revenue remained 
resilient throughout the financial year despite 
the level of change in the business and a 
severe recession throughout most of 2009. 
LFL growth in quarter four of the financial 
year was 6.6% against a 2.6% LFL decline in 
quarter three, with clear signs of recovery in 
all three divisions.
Gross margin reduced to 21.2% of revenue 
(2009: 22.9%) reflecting competitive market 
conditions and mix dilution, as relatively 
lower margin businesses outperformed. 
Business Review
Competitive pressures have been intense 
throughout the year, though there have been 
signs of stability in recent months with price 
inflation feeding through on copper and 
steel. Stronger contract sales and excellent 
performance from F & P Wholesale (‘F & P’) 
have contributed to overall margin dilution.
Gross margin recovery in 2010/11 is a key 
objective and we remain confident that 
progress can be made as the broaded 
economy improves.
The costs to sales ratio decreased to 
17.5% (2009: 18.0%), with like for like 
costs down 5.6% in the year. As a result of 
action taken, annualised costs have been 
reduced by £13.4m. Operating margin, 
before exceptional costs and amortisation of 
intangibles, was 4.07% (2009: 5.06%) with 
the reduction in gross margin partly offset 
by a reduction in the costs to sales ratio. 
Productivity continues to improve with sales 
per employee up +3% (2009: +3%) with 
investment in infrastructure and systems 
supporting the improvement achieved.
Adjusted operating profit before amortisation 
of acquired intangibles and exceptional 
charges decreased by £12.8m (19%) to 
£55.0m (2009: £67.8m).
New sectors, new markets and new 
customers have been targeted and the 
business recognised to improve focus and 
deliver growth. The acquisition of DHS 
and UGS open up new growth potential 
for BSS and we believe we have bought 
well. DHS achieved a 35% ROCE in its 
first full year of Group ownership and UGS, 
acquired on 5 February 2010, for £5.2m, 
provides the Group with a major player in 
the underground drainage market. Both 
companies provide BSS with significant 
new growth potential in markets that have 
robust dynamics. 
“ We are pleased with the 
performance of the new  
revenue streams. 
New sectors, new markets and 
new customers have been 
targeted and the business 
reorganised to improve focus 
and deliver growth.” 8 9 The BSS Group plc Annual Report & Accounts 2010  The BSS Group plc Annual Report & Accounts 2010  8 9 The BSS Group plc Annual Report & Accounts 2010  The BSS Group plc Annual Report & Accounts 2010  
Five Reasons to Invest
1. Resilient revenue
Demand for our products is primarily driven by repair and maintenance (‘R & M’) activity, 
much of which is considered essential. In particular, boiler and radiator markets and 
associated products, which account for a large proportion of our sales, remain robust. 
This non-discretionary spend in the heating market has proven to be resilient throughout 
the recession.
2. Underlying demand for our product increasing
We anticipate that underlying demand for product used to repair, maintain and improve 
existing facilities will increase driven by UK population growth and increased population 
density. The need to maintain existing facilities and an increased requirement for new 
homes which underpin revenue growth. 
3. Price inelasticity 
Our products are required to undertake essential repair and maintenance. We recognise 
the influence of competitive market conditions and remaining price competitive but the 
underlying demand for our product is primarily price inelastic.
4. A robust business model 
Our trade customers have a need for what we do and this need will remain. We add 
value through: consolidation of product; delivery to point of use; adapting our offer to 
meet customer need; providing availability; product knowledge and through leveraging 
procurement and sourcing. The business model underpinning our trade remains robust.
5. New revenue streams
We are growing revenue in segments of the market where we have minimal penetration 
and where the growth dynamics are strong. These markets include: spares, renewables, 
drainage and meeting the needs of the water industry. 10 11 The BSS Group plc Annual Report & Accounts 2010  The BSS Group plc Annual Report & Accounts 2010  10 11 The BSS Group plc Annual Report & Accounts 2010  The BSS Group plc Annual Report & Accounts 2010  
Delivering growth
in a challenging market 
Market Drivers
1. Resilient Market
Boiler and associated product – 90% sold as 
replacement
The primary driver for boilers, radiators, pipes 
and accessories remains replacement on a 
repair and maintenance basis within existing 
housing stock.
2. Renewables
Focus on renewable energy
Changes in electrical feed in tariffs have 
heightened awareness of the financial and 
carbon footprint benefits of fitting renewable 
products. Sales of heat pumps, solar panels 
and all other renewable products increased and 
continue to do so. The Division has continued 
to invest in new growth streams which have 
partly offset contraction in traditional market 
segments. Renewable technology continues to 
become a core part of our future strategy.
3. Spares
Spares market worth £200m
Now in stock in 129 PTS branches, we have 
employed specialist staff to expand our 
customer base and offer. This has not only 
satisfied existing customer requirements but 
created a new revenue source by bringing 
us new customers as well. Demand is still 
increasing and more stocking points are 
planned.
4. Branch Network
Extending the existing branch network
New branch revenue continues to enhance 
the Domestic Division’s income and profitability 
and delivers solid returns to our shareholders. 
Further growth in the network is anticipated.

The Domestic Division increased revenue 
by 5.2% in the financial year against 2009 
with like for like revenue increasing by 0.8%, 
new branches contributed 4.4% growth and 
Direct Heating Spares a further 0.4%. Total 
sales in the second half were 11.2% higher 
than last year and like for like sales were 
up 5.3% against last year following a 4.3% 
decrease in the first half. The strengthening 
trend in sales in the second half of the 
financial year reflects: the beneficial impact 
of early cycle economic recovery; market 
share gains through improved sales 
effectiveness; a sustained period of cold 
weather; and some stimulus from the Boiler 
Scrappage Scheme.
The primary driver for sales of boilers, 
radiators, pipes and accessories remains 
replacement on a repair and maintenance 
basis of existing housing stock. The core 
boiler market has continued to hold up well 
and our boiler sales volume increased by 
6.3%. The Domestic Division continued 
to grow market share with new revenue 
initiatives in spares and renewables 
contributing to the growth achieved.
The new build market remained challenging 
with completions down year on year, 
however in the last six months of the 
financial year house builders opened sites 
and started to increase build programmes 
again. As a result of this, PTS increased 
turnover in this area by £11.5m to £26.9m, 
an increase of 75% on the previous year 
as we take advantage of this early cycle 
recovery. PTS has increased its market 
share by securing trade terms with a number 
of national house builders. Social and 
affordable housing has also contributed 
as we increased the number of framework 
agreements we are involved in.
During the year, PTS opened 15 new 
branches which takes the total number of 
trading locations to 322 there were no branch 
closures. The new branches continue to add 
value with variation to the proposition offered 
to meet the needs of local markets. This 
flexibility underpins the solid returns achieved. 
Our customer base continues to grow as 
does our national spread with in excess of 
400 PTS branches targeted.
Renewable sales in the year were £16.1m, 
up 124% on the prior year. Awareness and 
understanding of renewable technology 
continues to increase at pace. PTS is 
supplying solar, heat pumps and biomass 
technology through its commercial branches 
Business Review
which provide national distribution coverage. 
Further contracts have been won and the 
Division is benefiting from the investment 
made in stock, infrastructure and specialist 
staff. Renewable technology continues to be 
a core part of our future growth strategy and 
we remain confident that renewables offer 
significant growth potential.
Spendlove C. Jebb the Northern Ireland 
based merchant has continued to gain 
market share in a difficult economic climate. 
In 2009/10, Jebbs increased sales and 
remained profitable.
Direct Heating Spares (‘DHS’) was acquired 
in April 2009 for a consideration of £6.2m. 
The spares market, has strong growth 
dynamics and DHS has had an excellent 
first year under Group ownership performing 
ahead of expectations and achieving a 
ROCE of 35%. Around 80% of DHS sales 
are through PTS’ 129 spares branches. 
DHS has achieved contract gains, is 
broadening its product offer and has 
recruited several major customers. In April 
2010 DHS moved to working seven days 
a week with an overnight next day delivery 
service. Further new revenue is targeted and 
we are confident that the DHS acquisition 
in partnership with PTS and F & P , offers 
substantial new growth for the Group.
F & P Wholesale (‘F & P’) distributes 
plumbing, heating and bathroom products 
nationally to independent merchants, fire 
and bathroom showrooms. Through a 
network of 11 branches, the latest opened 
in Scotland in August 2009, we provide 
a national service with next day delivery 
of leading brands. This ‘one tomorrow’ 
service enhanced by our competitive 
prices on own branded Pro and Fresssh 
products leads to a highly competitive model 
serving the independent trade. The core 
business is distribution of branded boilers 
complemented by F & P’s own brand, 
Procombi boilers, which increased volume 
sales by 200%. F & P has had a good year 
with like for like sales up 2.9% and a strong 
second half with like for like revenue up 8.7% 
on 2009. F & P continues to benefit from 
scale advantage.
We believe the Domestic Division is well 
positioned for growth in 2010/11 with the 
pricing environment and broader economic 
outlook expected to improve. 12 13 The BSS Group plc Annual Report & Accounts 2010  The BSS Group plc Annual Report & Accounts 2010  12 13 The BSS Group plc Annual Report & Accounts 2010  The BSS Group plc Annual Report & Accounts 2010   Business Review

Market Drivers
1. Infrastructure
Maintaining existing facilities
A core element of our industrial heating and 
ventilation business provides product that  
is used to undertake essential maintenance 
across commercial, industrial and publicly 
owned facilities.
2. Drainage Market
Developing a full offering into the total 
drainage market
We have expanded our expertise and product 
offering across the branch network for the 
above ground drainage market. The acquisition 
of UGS provides a platform to develop a 
national offering for the below ground drainage 
market. The increase in UK population density, 
its ageing infrastructure and environment 
requirement will drive an increase in the 
drainage market.
3. New Sectors

The Industrial Division has responded well  
to the challenges of tighter market conditions 
and slower commercial new build activity. 
Considerable progress has been made in 
repositioning the Division to broaden the 
spread and mix of business to build greater 
revenue resilience with new growth sectors 
targeted. The Division continues to win new 
business and grow market share, its strong 
strategic position in heating and ventilation  
is based on a nationwide branch 
infrastructure, a reputation for service and 
technical expertise.
Like for like revenue for the Division was 
down 6.8% on the prior year reflecting 
the late cycle nature of the Division’s 
core activity, but performance improved 
as the year progressed with second half 
revenue down 4.9%, like for like, against 
a 9.0% decline in the first half. Core repair 
and maintenance work has been resilient 
throughout the financial year and the price 
environment has improved in the second half 
with copper inflation a factor.
The Division continues to increase market 
share. The onsite facility at Stratford 
supporting the build programme for 2012 
Olympics has proved to be of great benefit. 
We have secured a number of the key 
stadium and infrastructure projects with 
our ability to manage timed delivery slots, 
helping to reduce labour down time and 
increase project efficiency. BSS Industrial 
is directly involved in eight projects on the 
Olympics site, revenue from Olympics work 
will peak in 2010/11.
Industrial’s share of the repair and 
maintenance market continues to grow and 
brands such as Havelock Controls, who 
supply heating control solutions, and AMS, 
who supply pumps, have seen good growth 
during the year.
In order to capitalise on the opportunity that 
the industrial market presents, particularly 
in the repair, maintenance and operational 
sectors, BSS Industrial has restructured the 
Division and now has an external sales force 
that is purely responsible for driving growth 
in this industrial market sector. This provides 
an excellent platform to sell the specialist 
brands within the Division and to grow  
future revenue.
Government funded work in the current 
financial year has remained solid with a 
broad spread of projects covering defence, 
schools, hospitals and prisons. In the short 
term, we anticipate that this work will remain 
Business Review
but that the level of investment beyond 2010 
will be curtailed. The urgency to develop 
new revenue streams in adjacent markets is 
driven by recognition of significant reduced 
public sector investment. This reduction has 
been anticipated and is manageable.
The above ground drainage market is a 
key area of opportunity. The UK market is 
substantial and BSS has the potential to 
establish a major presence in this market. 
This has led to investment in the opening 
of two dedicated branches at Canning 
Town and Bellshill plus a further 16 implant 
branches across the whole of the UK. The 
growth in sales in our implant and dedicated 
branches is extremely encouraging. 
We have further augmented this offering 
by the acquisition of UGS which is an 
underground specialist business turning over 
circa £36m through 10 branches across 
the UK. The below ground drainage market 
offers BSS considerable scope for growth by 
providing an opportunity to expand both the 
product range and national coverage. UGS 
adds a new customer base to BSS of both 
civil contractors and builders which provides 
both UGS and BSS with the ability to share 
project information and also sell a wider 
range of products to each others’  
customer base.
The Division has identified the water  
utilities market as offering significant growth 
potential. The Asset Management Plan 
(‘AMP5’) has now been approved with 
£26bn being invested over the next five 
years into drinking water infrastructure, 
waste disposal and processing. In order to 
capitalise on this investment programme, 
BSS has created a dedicated water 
distribution centre providing a next day 
service to all branches on a broader range 
of carbon steel and API product used 
predominantly in the water market. The 
acquisition of UGS also offers opportunities 
to supply both above and below ground 
product to this growing market.
The next 12 months is likely to remain 
a challenging period with an inherent 
uncertainty over the timing of Government 
investment reductions. The Division 
is however well positioned to capture 
significant market share in new sectors 
that will help to offset any downturn in its 
traditional markets. 16 17 The BSS Group plc Annual Report & Accounts 2010  The BSS Group plc Annual Report & Accounts 2010  16 17 The BSS Group plc Annual Report & Accounts 2010  The BSS Group plc Annual Report & Accounts 2010

The Specialist Division serves the 
maintenance, repair and overhaul (‘MRO’) 
market which is worth in excess of £3bn. 
The market includes power tools, hand tools, 
personal protective equipment, janitorial 
products and general industrial supplies. 
Buck & Hickman sells to end user industrial 
customers and Birchwood Price Tools sells 
predominantly to trade customers.
The Division contributed revenue of £103.6m 
(2009: £117.9m) and generated a profit of 
£2.0m (2009: £4.7m), prior to amortisation 
of acquired intangibles of £1.4m (2009: 
£1.5m) and redundancy costs of £1.0m  
(2009: £0.1m). Like for like revenue for the 
Division improved as the year progressed 
with quarter four sales 0.8% below last year 
after an 11.9% decline in quarter three.
2009 has proven to be an extremely 
challenging year for the B & H business with 
many of its manufacturing and engineering 
customers being severely hit by the 
recession, leading to major cut backs and 
lower usage of consumable products. To 
counteract revenue pressures B & H has 
taken swift action on its cost base with 
headcount reduced by 12% from 562 to 494 
and surplus warehouse capacity adjacent to 
the NDC in Coventry exited. 
The management team has been 
strengthened with a new Managing Director 
and Commercial Director appointed. 
Further structural changes were made to 
the business to ensure that there is a clear 
focus on operational excellence and sales 
effectiveness. New and experienced national 
account and regional managers have been 
recruited and many sales representatives 
have been replaced. B & H now has a 
strongly motivated and high calibre team, 
focused on growth and profit delivery.
B & H will continue to develop its sales 
proposition to its large end user customers 
and has invested in industrial vending 
solutions which complement its line side 
cribs and batch scanning processes. These 
new systems offer its customers secure 
control of consumables on the shop floor 
and provide in the opportunity for B & H 
to grow share without major customers. 
A number of new customers have been 
recruited on the back of investment made.
B & H has invested in e-trading with major 
enhancements to its website and this will 
continue with further upgrades to ensure 
ease of shopping, improved product data  
and imagery plus a first class customer 
Business Review
experience. Internet sales showed 25% 
growth in quarter four of the financial year.
B & H has also developed a stronger 
proposition in two of its key markets,  
PPE / Health and Safety and Janitorial, with 
new catalogues launched to complement 
the main catalogue and many new lines 
have been added to ensure a complete 
and competitive offer is available to all our 
customers. We remain confident that a more 
focused sales proposition will deliver growth 
in 2010 and beyond.
The Tooltastic trade counters have made 
good progress during 2009 and a major 
re-launch is planned for 1 June 2010, which 
will include a stronger stock profile, focusing 
on hand and power tools / PPE and 
fasteners and fixings. This will be backed 
up with a mini catalogue and a custom built 
website. The target for Tooltastic will be the 
construction sector. 
Birchwood Price Tools (‘BPT’) (formed by 
merging Birchwood Products and Price 
Tools on 1 April 2009) is focused on the 
wholesale market distributing power tools, 
hand tools and site equipment in the UK. 
The new proposition combining leading 
manufacturers of hand and power tool 
brands with the proprietary site equipment 
brands, taken to market via a national sales 
force and integrated marketing campaigns, 
has been well received by customers.
Trading conditions in 2009 for BPT have 
continued to be difficult with some customer 
sectors having been adversely affected 
by the economic slowdown. New product 
developments and major marketing 
campaigns featured heavily in the plan to 
combat the challenges of a flat market and 
created sales growth of 10.4% in the final 
quarter of the year. We are confident that 
BPT will have a better year in 2010/11.
BPT has also been developing new profit 
streams including the sale of proprietary 
brands on an international basis, and 
supporting the wider BSS Group with its 
procurement objectives, both of which are 
producing encouraging results. 20 21 The BSS Group plc Annual Report & Accounts 2010  The BSS Group plc Annual Report & Accounts 2010  20 21 The BSS Group plc Annual Report & Accounts 2010  The BSS Group plc Annual Report & Accounts 2010

Market Outlook and Economic Risk
The strength of the Group is evident in  
the results to 31 March 2010, which are 
sector leading.
BSS has grown revenue when many 
other companies in our sector have been 
in decline. We have delivered £44.2m of 
profit in the worst year for the economy in 
many years. This has been achieved by 
focusing on and listening to our customers, 
keeping close to our suppliers, through tight 
management of cost and through careful 
investment. 
We recognised some time ago that public 
sector investment was unlikely to continue 
at the current levels after the general 
election, as part of the rebalancing of the UK 
economy and took early positive steps to 
address this.
We are in the positive situation that 
around 90% of our revenue is not reliant 
on government capital expenditure and 
with the significant progress that we are 
making in areas such as spares, drainage, 
renewables and the water industry, coupled 
with an early cycle recovery in house 
building, the BSS Group is exceptionally 
well positioned to achieve profitable growth 
in the years to come.
We are confident in our ability to outperform 
the market, to develop further new revenue 
streams and to invest in organic growth and 
appropriate acquisitions.
We believe that the proposed increase  
in the final dividend of 10% is reflective of 
that confidence.

statements set on pages 51 to

further on the Group’s funding and 
liquidity; risks and policies and the

performance of the Group. 
Financial Review
The financial strength of the Group has 
improved significantly despite a period of 
economic turmoil that stretches back to 
2008. BSS has coped well in difficult trading 
conditions: with resilient revenue, a strong 
trading ethos and careful management of 
resource, cost and investment. We have 
absorbed the worst of the recession and 
are well placed to meet the challenges of 
2010/11 and beyond.
We are encouraged that in the worst year on 
year reduction in economic activity in more 
than 70 years, the BSS Group has delivered 
revenue growth, profit before tax of £44.2m 
and free cash flow of £21.4m. The 10% final 
dividend increase reflects our confidence in 
the future outlook.
The challenge of the last 24 months has 
been to ensure that BSS anticipates the 
impact of change in the markets we serve 
ahead of demand slowing and to act 
ahead of the downturn in order to protect 
earnings and cash flow. Cost and resources 
employed have been scaled down across 
the business in the face of recessionary 
markets. Like for like costs were reduced  
by 5.6% in the financial year ended  
31 March 2010, saving £13.4m, compared 
to a 2.3% reduction in like for like revenue. 
The exceptional cost of this change, £3.1m, 
relates to reduction in like for like employee 
numbers of 222 (4.5%). Cash generation 
throughout this challenging year has been 
positive with free cash flow in the year of 
£21.4m, from which dividends of £9.2m 
have been paid and £12.4m invested in 
acquiring two businesses, DHS and UGS. 
Both businesses have significant  
growth potential.
Long term value for our shareholders 
is achieved by focusing on delivering 
sales growth, improved profitability, cash 
generation and a solid return on capital 
employed. These shared goals drive decision 
making and behaviour in the Group with the 
financial objectives aligned to this end. 
Key to delivering revenue growth and strong 
returns for our shareholders is identifying 
opportunities where BSS can bring added 
value. Investment decisions are made in 
the context of a clear plan. We aim to build 
the specialist distribution capability of the 
Group in the UK through organic growth 
complemented with selective acquisitions 
that take the business into adjacent markets. 
This development can be achieved by 
leveraging existing knowledge and skills 
within the business to better effect and at 
manageable risk.
We have continued to selectively invest 
throughout the economic downturn and are 
confident that the Group will make further 
progress in 2010/11 with new growth 
opportunities targeted. 24 25 The BSS Group plc Annual Report & Accounts 2010  The BSS Group plc Annual Report & Accounts 2010  24 25 The BSS Group plc Annual Report & Accounts 2010  The BSS Group plc Annual Report & Accounts 2010

the recessionary months partly offset by cost 
savings and a £2.2m contribution from DHS. 
Industrial Division operating profit was down 
£4.9m (16.3%) reflecting slower commercial 
new build activity, competitive conditions and 
poor trading in Southern Ireland. Specialist 
Division made £2.0m against £4.7m in 2009. 
The Division absorbed the full impact of the 
contraction in manufacturing activity in 2009.
Group interest charges decreased from 
£6.6m to £4.8m reflecting the reduction in 
LIBOR against the prior year. Interest cover 
was a healthy 10.8 times (2009: 9.1 times) 
and gearing closed the year at 33.3%  
(2009: 37.1%).
Profit before tax decreased by £13.6m (23%) 
to £44.2m (2009: £57.8m). 
The tax charge for the year was £12.8m 
(29.0% of profit before tax) compared with 
a £16.8m charge in 2009 (29.1%). The total 
tax charge is above the basic rate due to 
expenditure not eligible for tax relief.
Earnings per share were 25.4p  
(2009: 33.3 pence). Adjusted EPS is 28.5p 
(2009: 35.2 pence) based on adjusted 
earnings after adding back exceptional costs 
and amortisation of acquired intangibles. 
There is no material difference between 
earnings per share and fully diluted earnings 
per share.
Shareholders’ Return
Total equity has increased in the  
year by £24.3m (10.5%) to £255.9m  
(2009: £231.6m).
The share price on 31 March 2010 was  
285p (31 March 2009: 288p), having been  
at a high in the year of 328p and a low of 
238p. The share price on 21 May 2010,  
the latest practical day before the publishing 
of these accounts was 310p. At the year  
end the market capitalisation was £354.4m  
(2009: £355.7m), which represents 1.4 times 
(2009: 1.5 times) shareholders’ funds.
Based on operating profit generated in the 
year, return on capital employed (equity and 
debt) was 14.5% against 20.3% in 2009. 
Given the positive trends in revenue and 
earnings and a more optimistic assessment 
of outlook, the Board recommends that the 
final dividend is increased by 10% to 6.09 
pence per share (2009: 5.54p), making a 
total for the year of 7.98p (2009: 7.43p).
Financial Results
For the year ended 31 March 2010, Group 
revenue increased by 0.9% to £1,352.4m 
(2009: £1,340.6m). Like for like revenue, 
which excludes the impact of acquisitions 
and new branches, decreased by 2.3% 
(2009: 0.7% decrease), with a 1.8% like 
for like growth (2009: 4.2% decrease) in 
the second half of the year. As the year 
progressed the business became stronger 
with like for like revenue growth in quarter 
four of the financial year of 6.6% against a 
2.6% decrease in quarter three. 
The Domestic Division has shown resilience 
throughout the key winter months of the 
‘heating season’, benefiting from sustained 
cold weather and a strong final quarter, 
despite January’s snow disruption. There are 
clear signs of an ‘early cycle’ recovery with 
new build residential activity picking up and 
the price environment improving.
The Industrial Division has absorbed the 
impact of a reduction in commercial new 
build activity but both government spend 
and core repair and maintenance work  
has held up well. Diversification and new 
growth opportunities should cushion the 
impact of reduced public sector investment 
in future years.
Both Buck & Hickman and BPT have 
faced tough trading conditions with their 
manufacturing and construction customers 
facing the full impact of the recession. 
Revenue trends improved in the second  
half as both businesses have made progress 
in recruiting new customers in preparation 
for growth.
Revenue growth on an organic basis,  
which includes the benefit of new branches, 
was up 0.6%, with bolt on acquisitions 
contributing a further 0.7% growth. The 
Group acquired Direct Heating Spares 
Limited (‘DHS’) in April 2009 at a cost of 
£6.2m and Underground Supplies Limited 
(‘UGS’) in early February 2010 for £5.2m 
(including acquired debt). DHS achieved  
a 35% ROCE in its first year of  
Group ownership.
New branches contributed 2.9% growth to 
Group revenue with a further 18 branches 
opened in the year. New branches continue 
to provide a satisfactory return on capital 
with their performance closely monitored. 
New branches continue to represent a good 
use of shareholder capital.
 
Gross profit of £286.6m was £20.0m 
(6.5%) down on last year. The gross 
margin percentage was 21.2%, down 
1.7% on 2009. The reduction in gross 
margin percentage reflects competitive 
market conditions, increased contract 
sales and adverse mix from strong trading 
performance from F & P Wholesale. The 
underlying gross margin differential narrowed 
in quarter four of the financial year relative to 
last year reflecting signs of price stability in 
the marketplace and improving  
economic conditions. 
Costs of £237.0m were £5.2m (2.1%) 
down on last year. Excluding the impact of 
acquisitions and new branches like for like 
costs were 5.6% down on last year. Bad 
debts written off cost £7.3m (0.54% of 
revenue) an increase of £0.4m on the  
prior year. An exceptional charge of £3.1m 
(2009: £1.2m) was made for redundancy 
costs and amortisation of acquired 
intangibles cost £2.3m (2009: £2.2m). 
Group cost to sales ratio, prior to exceptional 
costs and amortisation of intangibles, was 
17.1% against 17.8% in 2009. Adjusted 
operating profit of £55.0m was £12.8m 
(19%) down on the prior year (2009: 
£67.8m). The impact of the like for like 
sales decrease and lower gross margin 
percentage was partly offset by costs 
savings and contribution from new branches 
and businesses acquired. Based on 
adjusted operating profit, operating margin 
in the year was 4.1%, 1.0% below prior year 
(2009: 5.1%).
The adjusted operating profit reduction in 
the Domestic Division of £4.2m (11.4%) 
reflects the impact of competitive price 
conditions and adverse sales mix through  26 27 The BSS Group plc Annual Report & Accounts 2010  The BSS Group plc Annual Report & Accounts 2010  26 27 The BSS Group plc Annual Report & Accounts 2010  The BSS Group plc Annual Report & Accounts 2010  
Cash Flow
Free cash flow in the year of £21.4m  
(2009: £27.9m) was £6.5m lower than last 
year reflecting lower profits partly offset 
by lower capital expenditure. The working 
capital to sales ratio increased from  
14.0% to 14.4% of sales during the year.
Working capital in the year, excluding 
acquisitions, increased by £6.3m (3.3%) 
against 6.6% like for like revenue growth in 
the final quarter of the year. Tight control of 
working capital has been maintained and 
in-take of stock has been carefully managed 
to meet sales expectations.
 
Net debt decreased in the year by £0.7m to 
£85.3m (2009: £86.0m) with free cash flow of 
£21.4m offset by the cost of acquiring DHS 
£6.2m and UGS £5.2m plus dividends of 
£9.2m. Borrowings and interest cover remain 
at comfortable levels relative to earnings and 
the free cash flow of the Group.
Debt Facilities
The Group has a mixture of unsecured bank 
borrowings, unsecured loan notes at fixed 
and floating rates and retained profits to fund 
its day to day activities. The $125m of US$ 
loan notes are repayable in 2013 ($75m) 
and 2016 ($50m) and are used to fund the 
core debt of the Group. The loan notes were 
swapped into sterling at $1.73 = £1. There 
is no currency risk. In April 2009 the Group 
refinanced its Revolving Credit Facility (‘RCF’) 
replacing the existing £100m facility with 
a £90m facility which is repayable in April 
2012. This facility is provided by a syndicate 
of banks which is used to fund bolt on 
acquisitions and supplementary working 
capital requirement. In addition there is a 
£50m overdraft facility that was renewed in 
December which is used to fund the Group’s 
fluctuations in working capital as part of our 
short term borrowings.
The Group had unutilised credit facilities of 
£127.3m as at 31 March 2010. The ratio 
of net debt to earnings before interest tax 
depreciation and amortisation (‘EBITDA’) was 
1.47 times (2009: 1.18 times) at year end.
Capital Expenditure
During the year the Group invested £10.0m 
(2009: £15.4m) in capital expenditure of which 
£2.2m was invested in opening new branches; 
£4.4m upgrading IT systems and £3.4m 
upgrading branches, trade counters 
and warehouse facilities. IT investment 
reflects upgrade to existing networks 
and infrastructure as part of a staged 
implementation to improve core systems. 
Capital expenditure and significant disposals 
are subject to capital appraisal reviews with 
clear authority levels in place throughout  
the Group.
Pension Funds
The Group has three closed final salary 
pension schemes. The total Group pension 
deficit calculated on an IAS 19 basis for  
the defined benefit schemes was £26.2m  
at 31 March 2010 (2009: £30.9m). 
Despite a reduction in the AA long bond 
yield from 6.6% to 5.6%, which has added 
£28m to pension liabilities in the year, the 
three Group schemes have benefited from 
a relatively high level of its asset base (89%) 
being held in equities. As the equity markets 
have recovered the appreciation in assets 
has exceeded the increase in liabilities. The 
Trustees of the three schemes take comfort 
from the strong financial covenant of the 
Group and the Board’s prudent financial 
management. At the year end, the deficit 
represented 7% (2009: 9%) of the Group 
market value. 
Financial Risk Management
The Group Treasury team continues to  
co-ordinate the Group’ s banking and 
borrowing requirements, and controls 
exposure to foreign exchange and interest 
movements. The aim of this team is to 
minimise the effect of changes in external 
and internal conditions on the financial 
performance and net assets of the Group. 
The Group manages these risks using Board 
approved policies and procedures and does 
not enter into speculative contracts. Derivative 
instruments are used but only to manage our 
exchange and interest exposure.
Interest Rate Risk
As at the year end, 85% of the Group’s  
net debt is subject to interest rate hedging 
through swap transactions. The Group uses 
these interest rate swaps to manage its 
exposure to variable interest rates. Further 
information is set out in the notes to the full 
financial statements. 
Liquidity Risk
The Group finances its operations through a 
mixture of retained profits, bank borrowings 
and private placement finance. The 
borrowings are denominated primarily in 
Pounds Sterling and the Private Placement 
debt is denominated in US Dollars. Cash 
deposits are placed with banks at floating 
rates on periods ranging from overnight to 
monthly depending on forecast cash flow 
requirements and earn interest at prevailing 
rates in the money market. The maturity 
profile of borrowings is set out in notes 
15 and 16 to the financial statements. 
The Group maintains the mixture of 
long term, medium term and short term 
committed facilities as part of its liquidity 
risk management, which enables the Group 
to ensure that it is able to meet the funding 
needs of the business. 
Currency Risk
The Group’s exposure to foreign currency 
risk is increasing as direct sourcing actively 
increases. The Group’s wholly owned Irish 
subsidiary’s revenues and expenses are 
denominated in Euros. The Group faces 
minimal currency exposure on the translation 
of profits earned within this subsidiary and  
its related net assets. The Group’s trade 
purchases from overseas suppliers are 
either purchased in pounds sterling or in 
the relevant foreign currency. The Group 
enters into finance contracts to buy foreign 
currency forward to lock input costs at levels 
that enable the commercial teams to price 
and trade effectively. The Group’s balance 
sheet transaction exposure relates primarily 
to foreign currency trade creditors and  
is not material to the Group. Furthermore  
the Group’s US denominated borrowings 
have been converted to sterling using 
currency swaps.
Credit Risk
The Group has no significant concentration 
of credit risk and limits the amount of credit 
exposure to any particular customer across 
all trading Divisions via credit insurance and 
a Group wide credit limit. It has policies in 
place to ensure that sales of product are 
made to customers only with an appropriate 
credit standing and history. Regular credit 
review meetings are held to manage key 
debtors and overdue debts. Consequently, 
management believe that no further credit 
risk provision is required in excess of normal 
provision for doubtful debtors which stand at 
£7.9m (2009: £8.0m) at 31 March 2010.

Business Review
Corporate Social Responsibility
The Board is committed to Corporate 
Responsibility and the need to 
take proper account of our impact 
on the environment, the morale 
and welfare of our employees and 
the satisfaction of our customers. 
We will consider all social and 
environmental issues that could 
affect our business.
The strategic aim is to adapt our 
business to the consequences of 
climate change including taking 
advantage of the opportunities 
presented. As a result by 2012 we 
intend to increase our current sales 
of renewable products by at least 
50%.
Corporate values and commitment 
are to be translated into mainstream 
management practice and the 
Group has committed to:
Operate in an open and responsible •	
manner
Be inclusive in the way we manage  •	
the business
Ensure that management systems, •	
checks and balances are robust and  
that we comply with legislation and 
proper stewardship standards
Health and Safety
It has been an exciting time within the 
BSS Group with the launch of our Primary 
Authority Arrangement. We were delighted 
in February 2010 to become one of the 
first major distributors to sign up to the 
Primary Authority Scheme. We believe that 
the Primary Authority Arrangement is about 
sensible risk management with the regulator 
and the regulated working in partnership to 
ensure that the issues most likely to cause 
injury or work-related ill-health are prioritised 
and dealt with in a comprehensive, planned 
way across the whole of our 400+ sites. The 
BSS Group places health and safety at the 
very heart of its organisation and by entering 
into this partnership, we are demonstrating 
that we do not want to be part of the 
problem of injury and ill-health at work, we 
very much want to be part of the solution.
Commitment 
The BSS Group’s Board of Directors 
are committed to health and safety and 
demonstrate their commitment through 
documented systems of health and safety 
management. In addition the Executive 
Committee meets monthly whereby health 
and safety performance is reviewed at 
each meeting. Each member of the Board 
accepts their individual role in providing 
health and safety visible leadership therefore 
recognising their personal responsibilities. 
Our in house Health and Safety department 
is led by the Central Services Director, who is 
a member of the Executive Committee. The 
pivotal role of the health and safety team is 
to ensure continuous improvement across 
the Group by acting as health and safety 
champions, providing pragmatic solutions to 
the operational risks within the business to all 
levels of employees with a strong focus on 
behavioural safety and worker involvement. 
Performance 
We have continued to carry out a robust 
accident investigation programme with  
an emphasis on identifying root causes 
of accidents and ensuring that we do 
something to stop them reoccurring. 
Accident statistics for RIDDOR reportable 
incidents have decreased by 8.3%. 
There have been no improvement, 
prohibition notices or prosecutions from  
the enforcing authorities from either 
inspections or accident investigations  
that have been undertaken.
The health and safety team have  
continued to undertake regular health  
and safety audits to measure performance  
of our health and safety management 
systems and have recommended 
improvements where necessary to  
ensure that all recommendations have been 
implemented. The team carried out nearly 
300 branch audits / visits in the year ending  
31 March 2010.

The health and safety training team have

1,299 employees have received training on a 
number of courses commensurate with the 
Group Health and Safety Policy. In addition a 
further 427 employees have completed the 
online manual handling programme within 
the first week of employment. 
Employee Involvement and  
Working Environment
The importance of good relations and 
communications with employees is 
fundamental to the continued success of 
our business. The Group Chief Executive is 
the Board member responsible for Human 
Resources matters and updates the Board 
on a regular basis. 
We employ just under 5,000 people 
across the business and recognise the 
key contribution they make to our ongoing 
growth and success. Our employees’ 
wellbeing and professional development 
is central to recruiting and retaining high 
performing individuals. Over the last couple 
of years product knowledge systems 
have been introduced across PTS, BSS 
Industrial and Buck & Hickman, with 
a number of employees participating 
in apprenticeships, Builders Merchant 
Federation modules, and 136 employees 
receiving an NVQ qualification in the last 
12 months. The organisation has a robust 
talent management strategy in place 
which incorporates annual performance 
reviews, development plans and succession 
planning. Divisional newsletters are published 
regularly to employees to ensure they 
are kept well informed. Annual employee 
attitude surveys are conducted to measure 
employee motivation and provide an 
additional feedback facility for employees 
to communicate with the Company. The 
Company makes various benefit schemes 
available to all employees (subject to eligibility) 
including a Save As You Earn scheme 
(‘SAYE’). A benefits website is in operation 
with benefits ranging from the Company’s 
defined contribution pension scheme to 
concessions on gym membership. 
We are working in conjunction with a high 
street bank to provide all our employees with 
an on-site financial advisory service within 
the workplace. Our employees do not need 
to be a customer to take advantage of this 
free service.
We aim to maintain a progressive equal 
opportunities policy to ensure equal 
treatment for all irrespective of race, 
creed, colour, nationality, ethnic origin, 
age, language, religion, sexual orientation, 
gender or disability. Individuals are trained, 
developed, promoted and treated on the 
basis of their relevant aptitudes, abilities and 
skills. We recognise that everyone is different 
and by valuing diversity we appreciate 
that people with different experiences, 
views, opinions and approaches can bring 
important skills to the business.
The Company is committed to offering 
development and training to all its employees 
and offers a wide range of training 
techniques to enable all individuals the ability 
to develop and progress within the Group. 
The Training team offer apprenticeships 
with over 50 employees completing their 
apprenticeship in the last two years, all 
employees have the opportunity of gaining 
an NVQ level 2, and individuals have the 
opportunity to gain a City and Guilds.
There have been no breaches of our  
bribery policy.
BSS and the Community 
As a key member of the business 
community, we conduct all our business with 
honesty and integrity and are a responsible 
member of the community, which is 
communicated to our employees and 
stakeholders via our Community Relations 
Strategy document. 
PTS, part of the Domestic Division,  
continued to support the NSPCC as 
their charity partner for the year with our 
employees raising money to provide help 
for vulnerable children. By March 2010 the 
total sum of money raised was £40,000. 
This would not have been possible without 
the staff, suppliers and customers of 
PTS. Several events ranging from ‘hikes 
to summit’, golf days and a London 
marathon participation have helped to raise 
this amount. As of 1 April 2010 PTS is 
supporting the Cystic Fibrosis Trust.
BSS, part of our Industrial Division, has 
successfully completed 350 fundraising 
activities for Rainbow Trust over the last year. 
Staff have cycled (in particular the team of 
BSS Group and BSS Industrial directors 
cycled 215 miles from London to Paris), 
walked and run a combined 756 miles and 
completed hundreds of other daring feats to 
raise a grand total of £158,481 for the charity 
which supports families with children facing a 
life threatening illness. Employees have voted 
to continue supporting Rainbow Trust in 
2010 making it the fourth year running. 32 33 The BSS Group plc Annual Report & Accounts 2010  The BSS Group plc Annual Report & Accounts 2010  32 33 The BSS Group plc Annual Report & Accounts 2010  The BSS Group plc Annual Report & Accounts 2010  
Corporate Social Responsibility
Working together  
to improve our environment
BSS Industrial actively supports the Prince’s 
Trust with management time and financial 
contributions. Founded in 1976 by The 
Prince of Wales to improve the lives of 
disadvantaged young people in the UK, it 
has become the UK’s leading youth charity, 
giving practical and financial support to the 
young people who need it most.
A five week course for young people 
currently unemployed and wanting to gain 
experience of working in a construction 
related industry has been held. A group 
of 18 to 25 year olds were mentored on 
interview and presentation skills as well as 
subjects such as time management and 
manual handling. 
In 2008 the BSS Group joined Leicestershire 
Cares which is an organisation of key 
employers in Leicester and Leicestershire, 
dedicated to corporate responsibility by 
bringing businesses and the community 
together. The Group’s Leicestershire based 
sites have a number of volunteers who 
participate in the Right to Read, Numeracy 
Skills and Interview Techniques via 
Leicestershire Cares. 
The Company also offers work experience 
placements for ex-offenders, those coming 
out of care and long term unemployed. In 
April 2010 we were given the Leicestershire 
Cares ‘Company of the Year 2009’ award. 
This is in recognition of BSS’ commitment to 
the programme over the last 12 months.
The Group’s employees also held fund 
raising events for Great Ormond Street 
Hospitals ‘Jeans for Genes’ Appeal and 
Breast Cancer awareness which the 
Company fully supported. 
The Environment
We recognise the importance of responsible 
environmental management and the 
obligation to protect the environment. 
In particular we focus on:
Property: reducing the use of energy and •	
water consumption 
Transport: minimising emissions from our •	
transport fleet 
Waste: seeking opportunities to minimise •	
waste produced in all sections of the 
business 
Complying with all relevant environmental •	
legislation, regulations, standards and 
other relevant codes 
Providing, where possible, the most •	
efficient solutions for heating and  
pipeline processes 
Working with our suppliers towards •	
ensuring effective environmental supply 
chain management 
Having technologies in place at B & H •	
and BSS Industrial that monitor the fuel 
consumption of each commercial vehicle 
and this will be used to promote more 
fuel efficient driving 
Remote monitoring of electricity, gas and •	
water consumption at all sites above a 
certain size to focus on usage reductions 
Installation of intelligent heating systems •	
in new branches wherever possible 
We continue to hold ISO14001 accreditation 
for the BSS Group plc.
During 2009/10 we have continued our 
recycling programme and generated 
increased commitment from branch 
colleagues who have become much more 
aware of environmental issues. As a result 
we have substantially increased the quantity 
of card and plastic material that is baled 
and sent to recycling mills. We increased 
the amount of cardboard recycled from 279 
tons in 2008/09 to 510 tons in 2009/10 and 
increased the amount of plastic recycled 
from 59 tons in 2008/09 to 124 tons in 
2009/10. We had no prosecutions relating to 
environmental matters during the year. This 
reflects in part the fact that as a distributor 
our activities generally have a lower impact

Society
The BSS Group generates wealth 
for society and contributes to 
socioeconomic development 
through its sustainable business 
practices investment and 
employment
on the environment but also our proactive 
approach when planning and developing 
new branches. 
We recognise that waste and emission 
output are our most significant environmental 
impact and are able to report the following: 
PTS, part of the Domestic Division, exhibits 
renewable energy products at Green Energy 
Rooms in Nottingham and Newcastle as 
well as a Renewables branch in Aylesford. 
The Green Energy showrooms offer advice 
to make an informed choice about being 
socially responsible and cutting household 
bills when considering heating and plumbing 
options. Currently PTS and F & P offer 
a range of energy efficient products and 
emergent renewable technologies.
Renewable energy solutions are considered 
and installed at new branches subject to 
landlords’ consent and favourable physical 
conditions of the building. In addition, we 
are now monitoring ‘intelligent lighting’ 
systems in branches. Intelligent lighting turns 
warehouse lights off automatically in areas 
which are not used for a period of time.
The BSS Group is a member of Business 
in the Community (‘BITC’). BITC supports 
and challenges companies to integrate 
responsible business through their 
operations in order to have a positive  
impact on society and therefore be of  
‘public benefit’. We have participated in  
the 2009 Corporate Responsibility Index 
(‘CRI’), the UK’s leading benchmark for 
responsible business practice and are 
delighted to announce that we have 
achieved the Bronze band. The CRI  
helps companies to integrate and improve 
corporate responsibility throughout business 
operations, by providing a systematic 
approach to managing, measuring and 
reporting on business impacts in society 
and on the environment. Achieving Bronze 
means that BSS has demonstrated a clear 
outline of its mission, values and corporate 
responsibility principles, with clear roles and 
responsibilities being allocated right across 
the business.
The FTSE Group confirmed that the BSS 
Group plc had been independently assessed 
according to the FTSE4Good criteria,

Corporate Governance
Report of the Directors
The Directors of The BSS Group plc present their annual report  
to the shareholders together with the financial statements of the 
Group for the financial year ended 31 March 2010.
Group Activities 
The Group provides a comprehensive supply service for a wide 
range of products to industrial, commercial and domestic markets 
in the United Kingdom and the Ireland. The principal products 
relate to heating, plumbing, tools, industrial supplies, process 
control and pipeline equipment.
The subsidiary and associated undertakings principally affecting 
the profits or net assets of the Group in the year are listed in 
note 28 to the financial statements.
An overview of the development of the Group’s businesses for  
the year and of future development is included in the Chairman’s 
Statement, the Business Review and the Financial Review.
Business Review
The Company is required to set out in this report a fair review  
of the business of the Group during the financial year ended  
31 March 2010 and of the position of the Group at the end of  
that financial year and a description of the principal risks and 
uncertainties facing the Group. The information that fulfils the 
requirements of the Business Review are given in the Chairman’s 
Statement, the Business Review, Key Performance Indicators, 
Risks and Mitigating Strategies, Corporate Social Responsibility 
section and the Financial Review, which are incorporated in this 
report by reference.
Details of significant events since the balance sheet date are 
contained in note 29 to the financial statements.
Results and Dividends
The audited financial statements are set out in the accounts section.
The Group Income Statement is set out on the Consolidated 
Income Statement. The Group profit before tax for the year 
amounted to £44.2m (2009: £57.8m).
An interim dividend of £2.4m (2009: £2.4m) was paid on 6 January 
2010. The Directors recommend the payment of a final dividend 
for the year of £7.6m (2009: £6.8m) to be paid on 30 July 2010  
to shareholders on the register on 2 July 2010. This will make the 
total dividend for the year £10.0m (2009: £9.2m).
Share Capital
During the year the called up share capital was increased to 
£6,218,219 (124,364,375 shares of 5p each) as a result of the issue 
of 871,249 shares under the employees’ share option schemes. 
Movements in the Company’s share capital are shown in note 19 
to the financial statements. At the 2009 Annual General Meeting, 
shareholders renewed the Company’s authority to make market 
purchases of up to 12,349,712 Ordinary Shares of 5p each. 
No shares were purchased under this authority during the year 
ended 31 March 2010 and at the forthcoming Annual General 
Meeting, the Board will again seek shareholders’ approval to 
renew the annual authority for the Company to make purchases  
of its own shares through the market.
There are no restrictions on the transfer of Ordinary Shares in the 
capital of the Company other than certain restrictions which may 
from time to time be imposed by law, for example, insider trading 
law. In accordance with the Listing Rules of the Financial Services 
Authority, certain employees are required to seek the approval of 
the Company to deal in its shares.
Information on the Group’s share option schemes is set out in 
note 19 to the financial statements. Details of the Long Term 
Incentive Plan for key executives are set out in the Report of  
the Remuneration Committee.
Directors and Secretary
The members of the Board at the date of this report are shown  
on the Board of Directors page. No Director had an interest in any 
other contract other than a service contract with the Company  
or its subsidiaries at any time during or at the end of the year.  
A register of Directors’ conflicts has been established and Board 
authorisation obtained. As part of this process the members of  
the Board will endeavour to consider each conflict situation 
separately in its particular facts, consider the conflict situation in 
conjunction with the rest of his duties under the 2006 Act, keep 
records and Board minutes as to authorisations granted by 
Directors and the scope of any approvals given and regularly 
review conflict authorisation.
A Ball resigned as Executive Director on 14 October 2009. F Elkins, 
having been appointed on 1 December 2009, and being eligible, 
offers himself for election. R Harrison OBE, retires by rotation, and 
being eligible offers himself for re-election at the forthcoming Annual 
General Meeting. The Chairman, P Warry, will stand for annual 
re-election in line with provision A.7.2 of the Combined Code.
Directors’ Indemnities
In May 2006 the Company entered into a Deed of Indemnity  
to the extent permitted by law with each of the Directors.  
The Deeds of Indemnity will be available for inspection at  
the Annual General Meeting.
During the year the Company maintained Directors’ and Officers’ 
liability insurance cover, as permitted by section 233 of the 
Companies Act 2006.
Directors’ Interests and Share Options
The interests of Directors and their families in the shares of the 
Company and options to acquire shares are shown in the Report 
of the Remuneration Committee. There have been no transactions 
in shares by the Directors of the Company between 1 April 2010 
and 25 May 2010.
No Director has a non-beneficial interest in the Company’s shares.
Assets
No external valuation has been performed on land and buildings 
and the Directors’ estimate that the fair value of land and buildings 
equates to its carrying value.
Creditors Payment Practice
The Group has a general policy whereby it agrees and abides by 
terms of payment with its suppliers.

31 March 2010 was 63 days (2009: 66 days). The Company  
had £nil trade creditors at 31 March 2010 (2009: £nil).

Corporate Governance
Report of the Directors (continued)
Acquisition of own Shares
Since June 2008, the Company no longer holds any Ordinary 
Shares as treasury shares. 
Takeover Directive
Ordinary Shares are the Company’s only class of share capital.  
All the shares rank pari passu. There are no special control rights 
in relation to the Company’s shares. The rules governing the 
appointment and replacement of Board members and changes  
to the Articles of Association accord with English Company Law 
provisions. The Board has power to purchase its own shares  
and is seeking renewal of that power at the forthcoming Annual 
General Meeting. There are no significant agreements to which  
the Company is a party which take effect, alter or terminate in the 
event of change of control of the Company. Details of Directors’ 
agreements providing compensation on change of control are  
in the Report of the Remuneration Committee. Significant 
shareholdings are disclosed in this report. 
Employment Policy 
The Group philosophy is that ‘People Make Quality’ and that 
quality of service gives competitive advantage. The recruitment, 
training, development and remuneration of staff reflect this 
philosophy. Significant staff vacancies are published throughout 
the Group. All employees receive regular information on the 
trading performance of the Group and their own particular Division 
by regular team briefs and presentations. The Group is an equal 
opportunities employer and the policy of the Group is to give 
disabled persons fair consideration for all vacancies for which they 
are suitably qualified, and having regard to their capabilities. In the 
event of members of staff becoming disabled every effort is made 
to ensure that their employment with the Group continues and 
that appropriate training is arranged. It is the policy of the Group 
that the training, career development and promotion of disabled 
persons should, as far as possible, be identical to that of other 
employees. There is a share option scheme (‘SAYE’) available 
through which all employees may become shareholders in the 
Company, subject to conditions of eligibility.
We continue to invest substantially in a wide variety of training, 
both on and off the job, designed to meet the needs of the Group 
and staff at all levels.

The Combined Code
Principles of Good Governance
The Company adheres to the principles of Corporate Governance 
contained in the Combined Code (available at www.frc.gov.uk) on 
Corporate Governance that was issued in 2003 and updated in 
2006 and 2008 by the Financial Reporting Council.
The Board is committed to high standards of Corporate 
Governance and acknowledges the importance of good 
governance as being in the best interests of the Company,  
its shareholders and employees.
Statement of Compliance
The Group has adopted the 2008 Combined Code and considers 
that it has complied throughout the financial year ended 31 March 
2010 with the provisions set out in section 1 of the Combined 
Code, except in respect of:
A3.2 – The Independence of the Board
We recognise that with three Executive Directors and two 
independent Non-Executive Directors excluding the Chairman, the 
Board does not fully comply with the Combined Code regarding 
the balance of the Board. However, the Board unanimously 
believes that the current composition of the Board remains 
suitable for the nature and size of the Group. Experience and 
independent judgement of our Non-Executive Directors are more 
important than absolute numbers. We believe that the collective 
skills, experience and approach to running the business is 
appropriate for driving the Group forward and achieving the 
Group’s goals whilst maintaining the highest standard of 
Corporate Governance. The Board is satisfied that no individual or 
group of Directors has unfettered powers of discretion and that an 
appropriate balance exists between the Executive and Non-
Executive members of the Board. The appropriate number  
of independent Non-Executive Directors is regularly reviewed.
C.3.1 – The composition of the Audit Committee
We recognise that only two of the three members of the Audit 
Committee are independent Non-Executive Directors. However, 
the Chairman will remain a member of the Audit Committee as in 
the Board’s view his objectivity and ability to advise and question 
the Executive Directors, particularly in respect of financial affairs is 
not affected. His counsel has contributed significantly to the 
Group’s success.
Application of the Code
The Board has conducted a review of the Group’s Corporate 
Governance practice and the following statement describes how 
the principles of good governance in section 1 of the Combined 
Code have been applied.
The Board
The Company is controlled through the Board which currently 
consists of three Executive and three Non-Executive Directors. 
Biographical details of all Directors are given on the Board of 
Directors page 34.
The Board considers that all of the Non-Executive Directors 
excluding the Chairman are independent of management within 
the meaning of the Combined Code and are free from any 
business or other relationships which could materially interfere 
with the exercise of their independent judgement. They bring to 
the Board a wide range of experience of senior management in 
other areas of commerce and industry and represent a source of 
strong independent advice and judgement. The Non-Executive 
Directors meet several times a year without the Executive 
Directors present.
The Non-Executive Directors are appointed for a two year term of 
office. The Executive Directors have one year service contracts. 
Details of all payments to Directors are included in the Report of 
the Remuneration Committee.
One third of the Directors are required to stand for re-election 
each year on a rotational basis. New Directors are subject to 
election at the first opportunity following appointment and all 
names submitted to shareholders for election are accompanied 
by biographies.
Any Non-Executive Directors who have served for more than 
nine years are subject to annual re-election, and Non-Executive 
Directors who have served for more than six years are subject to 
rigorous review. Details of the Directors retiring and seeking 
re-election at the 2010 AGM are given in the notice of the meeting.
The terms and conditions of appointment of Executive and 
Non-Executive Directors are available to shareholders during 
normal business hours at the Group’s head office and at the AGM.
Board Procedures
All Directors are equally accountable under the law for the proper 
stewardship of the Group’s affairs. The Non-Executive Directors’ 
have a particular responsibility to ensure that the strategies 
proposed by the Executive Directors are fully discussed and 
critically examined to ensure that they take proper account of  
the best long term interests of the shareholders, employees, 
customers, suppliers and the community.
To enable them to do this, all the Directors have full and timely 
access to all relevant information and can take independent 
professional advice at the Group’s expense at any time should  
it be necessary. All Directors have access to the advice and 
services of the Company Secretary whose responsibility it is to 
ensure that Board procedures are followed. The appointment and 
removal of the Company Secretary is a matter reserved for the 
Board. Appropriate training is available to all Directors on 
appointment and on an ongoing basis as a consequence of the 
Board appraisal process.
The Board uses an annual agenda and review timetable to ensure 
that relevant matters are given due consideration.
Strategy
The Executive Committee held an annual off site meeting at which 
the Group’s strategy was reviewed in the context of the macro and 
micro economic environment, competitor strategies and the need 
for the Group to create competitive advantage. The outcome was 
reported to the Board and taken into account when the Board 
reviewed and determined the strategy of the Group.
Business Plan
The Board reviewed the three year rolling Business Plan and 
yearly budgets/forecasts were updated quarterly to support the 
Group’s strategy. Progress reporting includes a detailed monthly 
Board report circulated to the Board and at each regular Board 
meeting the Group Chief Executive and Group Finance Director 
provide an update on progress within all areas. In addition, the 
interim and final results together with the Risk Register and the 
Register of Directors’ Conflicts were reviewed. As part of the 
biannual review of the Risk Register, the Board has analysed 
social, environmental and ethical (‘SEE’) risks but have found none 
to be material.
Compliance and External Relationships
All Divisional Managing Directors and Function Heads present to 
the Board annually. Health and Safety is reviewed in detail at each 
Board meeting and is the first item on the Board agenda.
The Board meets 10 times a year. Individual attendance at Board 
meetings and Board Committee meetings is set out in the table  
for the year ended 31 March 2010. 40 41 The BSS Group plc Annual Report & Accounts 2010  The BSS Group plc Annual Report & Accounts 2010  40 41 The BSS Group plc Annual Report & Accounts 2010  The BSS Group plc Annual Report & Accounts 2010  
Corporate Governance
The Combined Code
Principles of Good Governance (continued)
In addition, Directors have frequent contact between meetings. 
Directors also visit trading locations in order to maintain close 
contact with the Group’s business.
There is an agreed Schedule of Matters reserved for the Board  
for collective decision making, which was reviewed in April 2010. 
These matters include setting long term Group objectives and  
the strategies to be employed in achieving them, setting policies  
in the areas of health and safety, the environment, recruitment  
and employment, risk management, treasury and, subject to 
materiality thresholds, decisions on the raising of capital, financial 
commitments, acquisitions and disposals and the prosecution, 
defence and settlement of litigation.
The Board has delegated to the Group Chief Executive 
responsibility for the development and preparation of the Business 
Plan for the Group and annual Group budget for recommendation 
to the Board. As the Senior Executive Director, the Group Chief 
Executive is responsible for all aspects of day to day operational 
control of the Group and execution of the Group strategy. The 
Group Chief Executive has established and chairs an Executive 
Committee (whose other members are the Managing Directors of 
principal operating businesses, the Group Finance Director, 
Function Heads and the Group Company Secretary) to assist him 
in the performance of his duties which meets once a month. There 
is a clear division between the roles and responsibilities of the 
Chairman and the Group Chief Executive and both have been set 
out in writing.
The Terms of Reference for the Board and each of its Committees 
are available on request from the Group Company Secretary, for 
inspection at the Annual General Meeting and are also available 
on the Company’s website (www.bssgroup.com). The Business 
Conduct Policy, the Environmental Policy, the Health and  
Safety Policy, the Ethical Trading Policy, the Charity Policy,  
the Community Policy and the Public Policy are also available  
on this website.
Information and Professional Development
The Board is supplied with information in a form and quality to 
enable it to take informed decisions and to discharge its duties. 
Directors were provided with the opportunity to update their skills 
and knowledge, including, in the year under review, updates on 
final implementation of the Companies Act 2006 and the Bribery 
Bill. In the case of newly appointed Directors, an induction 
programme which includes training on the responsibilities of a 
Director occurs prior to or immediately following the appointment 
to the Board. In addition, several Board meetings a year are held 
at Group locations other than Head Office.
Board Effectiveness
The evaluation of effectiveness of the Board and its Committees 
focused on a number of areas, including those concerned with 
best practice based on the principles of good governance. Our 
evaluation was carried out internally by the Chairman through  
a detailed questionnaire and formal appraisals of the individual 
performance of the Non-Executive Directors were conducted  
by the Chairman by holding a meeting with each Director. All 
Executive Directors are appraised annually by the Group Chief 
Executive and the Group Chief Executive is appraised by the 
Chairman. Led by the Senior Independent Director, the 
Non-Executive Directors meet without the Chairman present 
annually to appraise the Chairman’s performance.
The Directors assessed the findings of the appraisal in February 
2010 and concluded that the Board members demonstrate 
commitment, give sound guidance and direction to the business 
and that the Board Committees operate effectively. Each Director 
continues to make an effective contribution to the work of  
the Board, is well prepared and informed and has a good 
understanding of the Group’s businesses. Points raised  
during the previous year have been satisfactorily addressed.
The papers presented by the executive management are 
comprehensive and plans brought to the Board are challenged 
robustly and critically. However, once the debate is summarised 
and a way forward agreed, the Executive Committee have  
total support with a strong sense of consensus and collective 
ownership.

(Where n/a appears in the table the Director listed is not a member of the Committee.)
The Remuneration Committee
The Remuneration Committee comprises the Non-Executive 
Directors only and is chaired by Mr R J Harrison OBE. The 
Remuneration Committee has access to external research on 
market data and trends provided by an independent experienced 
consultant. New Bridge Street Consultants LLP, who have  
no other connection with the Company, continued to be the 
Company’s advisors during the year. Information is available  
in the Report of the Remuneration Committee.
The Committee decides on all aspects of the remuneration  
of the Executive Directors and the Chairman including basic 
salaries, performance related elements like short and long  
term bonuses, share options and other benefits. It advises the 
Board on matters relating to the remuneration of the Group as a 
whole such as pay rises, Group wide SAYE schemes, Executive 
Share schemes or grants for Executives other than main Board 
Directors. The remuneration of Non-Executive Directors is 
determined by the Board.
The Nomination Committee
The Nomination Committee comprises the Non-Executive 
Directors and the Group Chief Executive and is chaired by  
Mr P T Warry. Appointments to Executive Director are fully 
discussed by the Chairman and Group Chief Executive with the 
Remuneration and Nomination Committees before a proposal is 
formally made to the Board by the Chairman of the Nomination 
Committee. Possible new Non-Executive Directors are chosen 
from a shortlist supplied by external consultants in light of the 
requirements of the Group’s business and the need to have a 
balanced Board. Recruitment consultants are used to assist  
the process.
Following the appointment of a new Director, the Chairman, in 
conjunction with the Group Company Secretary and the Group 
Chief Executive, is responsible for ensuring that a full, formal  
and tailored induction to the Company is given. The Nomination 
Committee meets at least annually and reviews the structure,  
size and composition of the Board and makes recommendations 
for any changes. It discusses and gives full consideration to 
succession planning at both Group level and the management 
level immediately below. Candidates are identified and nominated 
to fill Group vacancies both Executive and Non-Executive, as and 
when they arise. 40 41 The BSS Group plc Annual Report & Accounts 2010  The BSS Group plc Annual Report & Accounts 2010  40 41 The BSS Group plc Annual Report & Accounts 2010  The BSS Group plc Annual Report & Accounts 2010  
 
The Audit Committee
The Audit Committee comprises the Non-Executive Directors  
and the Group Chairman only and has been chaired by 
 Mr T Osbaldiston since his appointment on 1 January 2004,  
who as the Finance Director of Raymarine PLC (until May 2010),  
has recent and relevant financial expertise. The Board considers that 
the membership of the Audit Committee as a whole has sufficient 
recent and relevant financial experience to discharge its functions. 
Executive Directors, external auditors and the internal auditors also 
attend by invitation as required. The Committee monitors the integrity 
of the financial statements of the Group and reviews significant 
financial reporting issues. The effectiveness of internal controls and 
risk management systems are kept under review. Through the 
Group’s Whistle Blowing Policy, employees of the Group may raise 
concerns about possible improprieties in financial reporting, other 
operational matters or inappropriate personal behaviours in the work 
place. Whistle blowing incidents and their outcome are reported to 
the Audit Committee. The Chairman of the Audit Committee meets 
with both the external and internal auditors on several occasions 
during the year without Executive Directors being present.
The Committee ensures that an adequate, properly resourced  
and supported internal audit function is in place and monitors and 
reviews its effectiveness. The effectiveness of the external audit is 
also reviewed and the Committee ensures that recommendations 
are acted upon by management.
The external auditors have direct access to the Chairman of  
the Audit Committee and meet with him without management 
present. The Audit Committee meets at least twice a year and  
has overall responsibility for monitoring the Group’s systems  
of internal financial control, the external and internal reporting 
processes and the financial control environment of the Group.  
The Audit Committee reviews the scope and results of the audit, 
its cost effectiveness, and the independence and objectivity  
of the auditors. PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP (‘PwC’) are 
engaged as the external auditors to all the Group’s companies 
and have held the role for over 30 years. Details of audit and 
non-audit fees are set out in note 2 to the financial statements. 
Non-audit fees principally relate to taxation advice. All services 
performed by PwC are carried out in accordance with the 
requirements of the UK Auditing Practices Boards’ Ethical 
Standard 5, relating to non-audit services performed by the 
Company’s auditors.
The Committee has undertaken its annual review of the 
qualification, expertise, resources and independence of the 
external auditors and the effectiveness of the external audit 
process by: reviewing, and approving, PwC’s plans for the audit  
of the Group’s financial statements, the terms of engagement for 
the audit and the proposed audit fee; considering the views of 
Directors, senior management and the PwC engagement partner 
on PwC’s independence, objectivity, integrity, audit strategy and 
its relationship with the Group, obtained by way of interview; and 
taking into account information provided by PwC on their 
independence and quality control procedures. In making its 
recommendation to the Board that PwC be reappointed for  
a further year, the Committee took into account their tenure as 
auditors and considered whether there should be a full tender 
process. There were no contractual obligations restricting the 
Committee’s choice of external auditors.
Executive Committee
The Executive Committee is responsible for implementing the 
strategies and policies determined by the Board, managing the 
business and affairs of the Company, prioritising human resources 
and establishing best management practices. The Executive 
Committee is also responsible for monitoring the Divisional 
Boards’ performance. 
The Executive Committee is currently comprised of Gavin Slark 
(Chairman) – Group Chief Executive, Roddy Murray – Group 
Finance Director, Frank Elkins – Executive Director and MD of BSS 
Industrial, Kelvin Stevens – MD of PTS, Howard Luft – MD of Buck 
& Hickman, Mark Earnshaw – MD of F & P Wholesale, Anthony 
Smith – MD of Birchwood Products, Kelvin Liscombe – Corporate 
Development Director, Sandra Smith – Group Human Resources 
Director, Jonathan Jennings – Group Central Services Director, 
Mike Spalding – Group IT Director and Ute Ball – Group 
Company Secretary.
Internal Control
The Board is responsible for the Group’s system of internal control 
and has reviewed its effectiveness during the year. The Combined 
Code requires that the Directors review the effectiveness of the 
Group’s system of internal control which includes financial, 
operational, compliance and risk management controls.
The system of internal control is designed to safeguard the assets 
of the Group, ensure the accuracy of its reporting and enable 
efficient operations and compliance with laws and regulations.  
In establishing this system, the Directors considered the nature  
of the Group’s business, including the materiality of the risks  
being run, the likelihood of a loss being incurred and the costs  
of control and mitigation of likely losses. It therefore follows that 
the system of internal control can only provide reasonable and  
not absolute assurance.
An ongoing process for identifying, evaluating and managing  
the significant risks faced by the Group has been in place from  
the beginning of the financial year to the date of approval of the 
Annual Report and Accounts. The process is regularly reviewed 
by the Board and accords with the Internal Control Guidance for 
Directors and the Combined Code produced by the Turnbull 
Guidance 2005. 
The processes by which the Board review the effectiveness  
of the internal control system include the following:
An established framework of internal financial control including •	
independent check, which includes a clearly defined 
management structure and comprehensive systems of 
budgeting and financial reporting which are reviewed by 
successive levels of management 
Guidelines for capital expenditure which include budgets, appraisal •	
and review procedures and successive authorisation levels 
Internal financial controls and procedures for branches are •	
included in branch operating manuals 
All trading locations are reviewed regularly by the Internal  •	
Audit department, and the Audit Committee receives reports 
from the internal and external auditors on a regular basis 
The Executive Management Committee receives a monthly •	
summary of financial results and the Group’s published 
biannual financial information is based on a standardised 
reporting process 
The Group also has in place systems and procedures for existing 
control and managing risk in respect of financial reporting and the 
preparation of consolidated accounts.
The Directors have also reviewed the effectiveness of the system 
of internal financial control during the period in conjunction with 
the work of the Internal Audit department in relation to the 
safeguarding of assets, the maintenance of proper accounting 
records and the reliability of financial information used within the 
business and for publication. 42 43 The BSS Group plc Annual Report & Accounts 2010  The BSS Group plc Annual Report & Accounts 2010  42 43 The BSS Group plc Annual Report & Accounts 2010  The BSS Group plc Annual Report & Accounts 2010  
Corporate Governance

Principles of Good Governance (continued)
Investor Relations
Communication with all shareholders is given a high priority. 
Formal communications accounting for the Company’s 
performance and strategy are principally through the Annual 
Report and Accounts and announcements made through the 
Stock Exchange and at the Annual General Meeting. In addition, 
corporate information is made available to investors on the 
Company’s website (www.bssgroup.com).
Presentations are made to institutional shareholders following  
the announcement of the Company’s full year and interim results, 
and regular meetings are held between these investors and  
the Group Chief Executive and the Group Finance Director. In 
addition, institutional shareholders have visited some of the 
Group’s distribution centres. The Chairman attends some of the 
meetings with investors and is available to meet with institutional 
investors upon request. 
All members of the Board, including the Non-Executive Directors, 
receive a report on any significant discussions with shareholders 
and the feedback that follows the interim and yearly presentations 
to investment analysts and shareholders. All Directors attend the 
Annual General Meeting and the Board encourages shareholders 
to attend its Annual General Meeting. Directors, including the 
Chairmen of the Committees, are present to answer any questions 
from shareholders. The Notice of the Meeting is sent to 
shareholders at least 20 working days before the meeting. The 
results of proxy voting by shareholders will be disclosed for each 
separate resolution and will be posted on the Company’s website 
as well as disclosed upon request.
Mr R J Harrison OBE, has held the post of Senior Independent 
Director since 3 August 2006 and is the Director whom 
shareholders may contact if they feel their concerns are  
not being addressed.
Going Concern
The Group’s business activities, together with the factors likely to 
affect its future development, performance and position are set 
out in the Business Review section. The financial position of the 
Group, its cash flows, liquidity position and borrowing facilities are 
described in the Financial Review section. In addition notes 13 
and 16 to the financial statements include the Group’s objectives, 
policies and processes for managing its capital; its financial risk 
management objectives; details of its financial instruments and 
hedging activities; and its exposure to credit risk and liquidity risk.
The Group has reviewed its key risk areas and in particular 
liquidity risk in relation to its bank facilities, credit risk associated 
with the Group’s key customers and the risk of reduced demand 
for its products due to the current economic downturn in the 
United Kingdom. The Group’s forecasts and projections, taking 
account of reasonably possible changes in trading performance, 
show that the Group should be able to operate within the level of 
its current facilities. The Group renegotiated its Revolving Credit 
Facility during April 2009 and therefore now has £90m debt not 
due for repayment until 2012, £43m not due until 2013 and £29m 
not due until 2016.
After making enquiries, the Directors have reasonable expectation 
that the Company and the Group have adequate resources to 
continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future. 
Accordingly, they continue to adopt the going concern basis  
in preparing the Annual Report and Accounts. 42 43 The BSS Group plc Annual Report & Accounts 2010  The BSS Group plc Annual Report & Accounts 2010  42 43 The BSS Group plc Annual Report & Accounts 2010  The BSS Group plc Annual Report & Accounts 2010  
Directors’ Responsibilities
The Directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report,  
the Report of the Remuneration Committee and the financial 
statements in accordance with applicable law and regulations.
Company law requires the Directors to prepare financial 
statements for each financial year. Under that law the Directors are 
required to prepare the Group financial statements in accordance 
with International Financial Reporting Standards (‘IFRSs’) as 
adopted by the European Union, and have elected to prepare the 
Parent Company financial statements in accordance with United 
Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice (United 
Kingdom Accounting Standards and applicable law). Under 
Company law the Directors must not approve the financial 
statements unless they are satisfied that they give a true and fair 
view of the state of affairs of the Group and the Company and of 
the profit or loss of the Group for that period. In preparing these 
financial statements, the Directors are required to:
Select suitable accounting policies and then apply  •	
them consistently
Make judgements and accounting estimates that are •	
reasonable and prudent
State whether IFRSs as adopted by the European Union and •	
applicable UK Accounting Standards have been followed, 
subject to any material departures disclosed and explained  
in the Group and Parent Company financial statements 
respectively
The Directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting 
records that are sufficient to show and explain the Company’s 
transactions and disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time 
the financial position of the Company and the Group and enable 
them to ensure that the financial statements and the Report of the 
Remuneration Committee comply with the Companies Act 2006 
and, as regards the Group financial statements, Article 4 of the 
IAS Regulation. They are also responsible for safeguarding the 
assets of the Company and the Group and hence for taking 
reasonable steps for the prevention and detection of fraud and 
other irregularities.
The Directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity  
of the Company’s website. Legislation in the United Kingdom 
governing the preparation and dissemination of financial 
statements may differ from legislation in other jurisdictions. 
Each of the Directors, whose names and functions are listed  
in the Board of Directors section of the Annual Report, confirm 
that, to the best of their knowledge:
The Group financial statements which have been prepared in •	
accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the EU and the Parent 
Company financial statements which have been prepared in 
accordance with UK GAAP, give a true and fair view of the 
assets, liabilities, financial position and profit of the Group  
and Company
The Report of the Directors includes a fair review of the •	
development and performance of the business and the 
position of the Group, together with a description of the 
principal risks and uncertainties that it faces.

Corporate Governance
Report of the Remuneration Committee
This report has been prepared in accordance with Schedule 8 to 
the Accounting Regulations under the Companies Act 2006. The 
report also meets the relevant requirements of the Listing Rules of 
the Financial Services Authority and describes how the Board has 
applied the principles of good governance relating to Directors’ 
remuneration. Shareholders will be invited to approve the report  
at the Annual General Meeting of the Company to be held on  
29 July 2010.
The Act requires the auditors to report to the Company’s 
members on certain parts of the Report of the Remuneration 
Committee and to state whether in their opinion those parts of  
the report have been properly prepared in accordance with the 
Accounting Regulations. The report has therefore been divided 
into separate sections for audited and unaudited information.
Unaudited Information
Remuneration Committee
The Company has established a Remuneration Committee  
(‘the Committee’) which is constituted in accordance with the 
recommendations of the Combined Code. The current members 
of the Committee, all of whom are Non-Executive Directors, are 
given on page 36. There has been no change to the composition 
of the Committee in the year. The Chairman of the Committee  
is Mr R J Harrison OBE. The Group Company Secretary acts as 
its secretary. Mr G Slark, as Group Chief Executive, is invited by 
the members of the Committee to attend part of meetings to 
consult on the proposed remuneration packages of the senior 
management team. The terms of reference for the Committee can 
be found on the Corporate Governance section of the Group’s 
website at www.bssgroup.com.
The role of the Committee is to decide on all aspects of the 
remuneration packages of the Executive Directors and the 
Chairman (in his absence). The Group Chief Executive and the 
Chairman put a recommendation to the Board regarding the 
remuneration of the Non-Executive Directors, who are absent 
from the Committee meeting whilst this is discussed and agreed. 
The Committee reviews all aspects of remuneration for all direct 
reports of Executive Directors and all members of the senior 
management team.
Remuneration Policy
The Group aims to provide competitive salary and benefit 
packages for all employees. As far as is practicable it pursues a 
consistent policy of terms and conditions across the Divisions. In 
that context benefits such as share options and pension scheme 
membership are open to all qualifying employees.
In assessing all aspects of pay and benefits, comparison is made 
with the packages offered by companies of similar size and 
business diversity and after considering general pay and 
employment conditions in the Group. The Committee has access 
to New Bridge Street Consultants LLP, who act as independent 
consultants and do not provide any other services to the Group, 
and provide external research on market data and trends. In order 
to align individual’s rewards with the Company’s performance, 
annual bonuses and share incentive schemes are linked to the 
Company’s strategy and determined by levels of performance 
achieved against key targets.
During the year the Committee met five times and the following 
issues were discussed:
Review the current remuneration policy against the market •	
Review the salary levels of the Executive Directors and senior •	
management team
Agree the annual bonus payments for the financial year ended •	
31 March 2009
Agree the annual bonus targets for the financial year ended  •	
31 March 2010
Agree the vesting of the 2006 Performance Share Plan awards •	
Review the performance measures and targets for the 2009 •	
Performance Share Plan awards
Approve the Report of the Remuneration Committee •	
Executive Directors
The Committee aims to ensure that remuneration packages are 
competitive and designed to attract, retain and motivate the 
Executive Directors to maintain the profitable growth of the 
business. As far as possible, it is the Committee’s intention to 
align Executive Directors’ interests with those of the shareholders.
The main elements of the remuneration package for Executive 
Directors are as follows:
Basic salary •	
Benefits in kind •	
Annual bonus scheme •	
Pension arrangements •	
Share incentive schemes •	
The Group’s policy is that a substantial proportion of the 
remuneration of the Executive Directors should be performance 
related to align performance measures of the Group with those  
of the Directors. The targeted composition of each Executive 
Director’s annual remuneration is for performance related 
remuneration to be more than 50% of the total.
During the year the Committee reviewed the following areas  
of the senior management’s remuneration in light of the current 
economic conditions and the approach to pay awards for the 
other employees of the Group. 
Basic Salary
Basic salary for each Executive Director is determined by the 
Committee annually after a review of individual performance and 
having regard to competitive practice. Pay rises take effect from  
1 April each year unless an individual changes role, when pay 
changes take effect from the date of change. All Executive 
Directors received pay rises on 1 April 2009 after review by the 
Remuneration Committee against benchmark data for other 
market sector companies and taking into account the sustained 
growth and performance of the business which has doubled its 
size over the last five years. 
All employees and Directors pay increases effective from  
1 April 2009 were individually determined based upon their own 
performance and were typically within a range of 0 to 5%. There 
were no annual pay increases for any Director or employee  
on 1 April 2010.
Benefits in Kind
The Executive Directors receive certain benefits in kind,  
which in the main relate to the provision of a company  
car and medical insurance.
Annual Bonus Scheme
All of the Executive Directors are eligible to participate in a short 
term cash incentive scheme for which targets are set annually  
by the Remuneration Committee. The targets are designed to 
encourage individual performance, operating efficiencies and 
profitable growth. During 2009/10 these related to improvements 
in profit before taxation after allowance for bonuses (90% of basic 
salary) and the achievement of working capital targets (10% of 
basic salary). Mr F M Elkins’s targets differ to Mr G Slark and  
Mr J R Murray, as he is also a Managing Director of BSS Industrial. 
65% of basic salary is based upon improvements in profit before 
taxation after allowance for bonuses for the Group and another  44 45 The BSS Group plc Annual Report & Accounts 2010  The BSS Group plc Annual Report & Accounts 2010  44 45 The BSS Group plc Annual Report & Accounts 2010  The BSS Group plc Annual Report & Accounts 2010  
 
30% of basic salary is based upon this metric but just for BSS 
Industrial. The final 5% of basic salary is based upon achievement 
of working capital targets. Therefore the maximum payable under 
the scheme during 2009/10 was 100% of basic salary. For the 
financial year 2010/11, the maximum payable under the scheme 
will again be 100%. The targets for 2010/11 are again based upon 
the achievement of working capital targets (10% of basic salary) 
and profit before taxation after allowance for bonuses and as 
above for Mr F M Elkins. The profit before taxation is based upon 
growth above the budgeted profit before taxation for the Group. 
The targets for the 2009/10 scheme were not achieved for the 
profit before taxation element of the award, due to the decline in 
the economic environment that the Group trades in. Mr G Slark 
and Mr J R Murray will receive 7% of basic salary each based 
upon achievement of working capital targets. Mr F M Elkins will 
receive 5% of basic salary based upon achievement of working 
capital targets and 3% of basic salary based upon achievement  
of Industrial Divisional profit before taxation target.
Pension Arrangements
In line with the Group policy all new Executive Directors are eligible 
to join The BSS Group plc Group Stakeholder Pension Plan.  
The BSS Group plc Pension and Life Assurance Scheme, which  
Mr G Slark is a member of, is closed to members. The scheme 
provides a pension on normal retirement at age 62 based upon a 
maximum accrual rate of 1/75th of pensionable earnings for each 
completed year of service. Early retirement is possible from age 
55 if the Company agrees. Only basic salary is pensionable.
Share Incentive Schemes 
All of the Executive Directors participate in long term incentive 
schemes, details of which are set out below. The share option 
schemes are reviewed annually to ensure the grant level, 
performance conditions and vesting schedules remain  
appropriate and will align the interests of the participants  
with the shareholders.
There were two long term incentive schemes in operation during 
the year; The BSS Group plc Performance Share Plan and The 
BSS Group plc Approved and Unapproved Share Option Scheme. 
The BSS Group plc Approved and Unapproved Share Option 
Scheme final grant of options matured on 1 June 2007; there  
are no future plans to grant options under this scheme.
The BSS Group plc Performance Share Plan
The BSS Group plc Performance Share Plan (‘the Plan’), was  
first approved at the Annual General Meeting on 21 July 2005. 
This plan is used as a means of incentivising senior management 
and Executive Directors, to maintain the profitable growth of the 
Company such that their interests continue to be aligned with 
those of the shareholders. The maximum number of shares 
granted to any Director in any one year is equivalent to one year  
of basic salary.
The Plan is structured to reward performance where the Group 
achieves strong growth in earnings per share (‘EPS’) in excess  
of growth in the Retail Prices Index (‘RPI’). The fifth award under 
the Plan changed from targeting EPS growth to profit before 
taxation (‘PBT’), due to the economic slowdown in the second half 
of 2008/09. It allows for the Group to still motivate and align 
management incentives to those of the shareholders by re-basing 
the measure to the budget for the year. The grant targeted growth 
in profit before taxation of over 10% above RPI based upon the 
budget profit for taxation for financial year 2009/10. The same 
proportionate vesting from average growth per annum between 
5% and 10% growth over RPI was applied to targets for each of 
the three years during the life of the grant being 31 March 2010, 
31 March 2011 and 31 March 2012. The share price on the date  
of grant, 19 June 2009, was 260.25p.
The principal features of the Plan are as follows:
Participants will receive a promise of free shares subject to •	
meeting specific performance conditions; and
Vesting of awards will only take place once the performance •	
conditions have been satisfied and agreed by the 
Remuneration Committee
With a view to linking rewards to performance, average EPS (for the 2007 and 2008 grants) or PBT (for the 2009 grant) growth per 
annum for the awards made shall result in vesting as follows:
Growth in EPS / PBT (average per annum) over RPI Vesting
Less than 5% EPS / PBT  No part of the award will vest
Between 5% and 10% (inclusive)  Straight line proportionate vesting between 30% and 100% (inclusive)
More than 10% EPS / PBT  100% of the award will vest
The 100% vesting targets for the previous three years grants are shown in the table below. Where RPI information is not available  
yet a rate of 2.6% has been assumed for 2010/11 and 3% has been assumed for 2011/12.

The 2007 grant under the Scheme has not vested therefore all Directors and employees with interests in this grant will not receive their shares. 
There have been no variations to the terms and conditions or performance criteria for existing grants of share options during the year. 46 47 The BSS Group plc Annual Report & Accounts 2010  The BSS Group plc Annual Report & Accounts 2010  46 47 The BSS Group plc Annual Report & Accounts 2010  The BSS Group plc Annual Report & Accounts 2010

Dilution
Newly issued shares are currently used to satisfy the exercise of all employee and Executive share options. Grants of shares for the 
Performance Share Plan are satisfied by shares delivered from the Employee Benefit Trust which are bought from the Company using 
funding from the Company. 
In accordance with the ABI guidelines, the Company can issue a maximum of 10% of its issued share capital in a rolling 10 year period to 
employees under share plans. Within this 10%, the Company can only issue 5% to satisfy awards under discretionary Executive plans.
Save-As-You-Earn (‘SAYE’)
Executive Directors may participate in an HMRC approved SAYE scheme which is open to all eligible employees.
Details of Directors’ interests including share options are shown on page 48.
Share Performance Graph
The following graph compares the total return performance based on share price movements of the Group rebased against the total 
return of the FTSE 250 index over the five year period to 31 March 2010. As there are no directly comparable competitors in terms  
of size, demographic spread or activities, the FTSE 250 Index has been chosen as being a broad equity market index consisting of 
companies comparable in size to The BSS Group plc.

Executive Directors’ Contracts
It is The BSS Group plc policy that Executive Directors’ service contracts should be one year rolling contracts with notice periods of  
not more than one year. Contractual termination payments should not exceed one year’s remuneration, including bonuses, pension 
contributions, share options as felt appropriate by the Board dependent on the length of service completed in the year of termination.
All Executive Directors have service contracts. All are one year rolling contracts which provide for notice periods of six months by the 
Director and 12 months by the Group.
Contract dates for each Director are as follows:
G Slark 3 January 2006; J R Murray 2 May 2006; F M Elkins 1 December 2009.
Executive Directors, subject to Board approval, may hold an external Non-Executive directorship of businesses that do not  
compete with The BSS Group plc. No such appointments are currently in place. Directors may retain payments received in respect  
of these positions.  46 47 The BSS Group plc Annual Report & Accounts 2010  The BSS Group plc Annual Report & Accounts 2010  46 47 The BSS Group plc Annual Report & Accounts 2010  The BSS Group plc Annual Report & Accounts 2010  
 
Non-Executive Directors
The remuneration of the Non-Executive Directors is recommended by the Chairman and Group Chief Executive and agreed by  
the Board. Non-Executive Directors’ remuneration is all non performance related. Non-Executive Directors do not take part in any 
discussion regarding their own remuneration. Increases in Non-Executive Directors’ remuneration are made after review of market  
and competitor packages.
Non-Executive Directors do not have service contracts. Letters of appointment have been signed by all Non-Executive Directors which 
specify three months written notice by either party except in the event of a change of control of the business when six months notice  
will apply.

Director’s Pension
The increase in transfer values and accrued benefits for the Executive Director accruing retirement benefits under the Defined Benefit 
Pension Scheme, along with the accrued pension payable per annum at normal retirement age of 62, are shown below.
The accrued pension payable represents the entitlement payable annually on retirement in respect of service to the end of the year.  
The calculations exclude the effects of future inflation. The transfer value of the increase in accrued pensions in the year has been 
calculated in accordance with Actuarial Guidance Note GN11. The transfer values disclosed do not represent a sum paid or payable to 
the individual Director, instead they represent a potential liability of the Pension Scheme. Directors contribute 7% of pensionable salary 
to the Pension Scheme. The contributions have been excluded from the transfer values in the table below. The Director has the option 
to pay Additional Voluntary Contributions in respect of which neither the contribution nor the benefits are included in the table below.

We have audited the Group financial statements of The BSS 
Group plc for the year ended 31 March 2010 which comprise the 
Consolidated Income Statement, the Consolidated Statement of 
Comprehensive Income, the Consolidated Statement of Changes 
in Equity, the Consolidated Balance Sheet, the Consolidated Cash 
Flow Statement, the Statement of Accounting Policies and the 
related notes. The financial reporting framework that has been 
applied in their preparation is applicable law and International 
Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the 
European Union. 
Respective responsibilities of Directors and auditors 
As explained more fully in the Statement of Directors’ 
Responsibilities set out on page 43, the Directors are responsible 
for the preparation of the Group financial statements and for  
being satisfied that they give a true and fair view. Our responsibility 
is to audit the Group financial statements in accordance with 
applicable law and International Standards on Auditing (UK and 
Ireland). Those standards require us to comply with the Auditing 
Practices Board’s Ethical Standards for Auditors. 
This report, including the opinions, has been prepared for and 
only for the Company’s members as a body in accordance with 
Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies Act 2006 and for no other 
purpose. We do not, in giving these opinions, accept or assume 
responsibility for any other purpose or to any other person to 
whom this report is shown or into whose hands it may come save 
where expressly agreed by our prior consent in writing.
Scope of the audit of the financial statements 
An audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts and 
disclosures in the financial statements sufficient to give reasonable 
assurance that the financial statements are free from material 
misstatement, whether caused by fraud or error. This includes an 
assessment of: whether the accounting policies are appropriate to 
the Group’s circumstances and have been consistently applied 
and adequately disclosed; the reasonableness of significant 
accounting estimates made by the Directors; and the overall 
presentation of the financial statements.
Opinion on financial statements 
In our opinion the Group financial statements: 
Give a true and fair view of the state of the Group’s affairs as at •	
31 March 2010 and of its profit and cash flows for the year 
then ended; 
Have been properly prepared in accordance with IFRSs as •	
adopted by the European Union; and
Have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of •	
the Companies Act 2006 and Article 4 of the lAS Regulation. 
Opinion on other matters prescribed by the

internal control and risk management systems and about share 
capital structures is consistent with the financial statements. 
Matters on which we are required to report by exception 
We have nothing to report in respect of the following: 
Under the Companies Act 2006 we are required to report to you 
if, in our opinion:
Certain disclosures of Directors’ remuneration specified by law •	
are not made; or 
We have not received all the information and explanations we •	
require for our audit; or
A Corporate Governance Statement has not been prepared by •	
the Parent Company.
Under the Listing Rules we are required to review: 
The Directors’ statement, set out on page 42, in relation to •	
going concern; and 
The part of the Corporate Governance Statement relating to •	
the Company’s compliance with the nine provisions of the June 
2008 Combined Code specified for our review.

Basis of Preparation
These financial statements have been prepared in accordance 
with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) and IFRIC 
interpretations as adopted by the European Union and with those 
parts of the Companies Act 2006 applicable to companies 
reporting under IFRS.
The following interpretations of existing standards have been 
published that are mandatory for the Group’s accounting periods 
beginning on or after 1 April 2009 and have been adopted in the 
financial statements for the first time this year.
IAS 1 (Revised) ‘Presentation of Financial Statements’, details the 
requirement to aggregate information in the financial statements, 
introduces a statement of comprehensive income and changes in 
titles of some of the financial statements.
IAS 32 (Amendment) ‘Financial Instruments: Presentation’, 
requires a financial instrument to be classified as a liability if the 
holder of that instrument can require the issuer to redeem it 
for cash.
IFRIC 18 ‘Transfers of Assets from Customers’, clarifies the 
treatment of IFRS, particularly IAS 18 ‘Revenue’ for agreements 
in which an entity receives an item of property, plant and 
equipment from a customer to connect to an ongoing supply  
of goods and services.
Amendment to IFRS 7 ‘Improving Disclosures about Financial 
Instruments’, clarifies that fair value disclosure are required for 
each class of financial instruments separately.
IFRIC 15 ‘Agreements for the Construction of Real Estate’, 
standardises accounting practice across jurisdictions for the 
recognition of revenue among real estate developers for sale of 
units, such as apartments, or houses.
Amendments to IAS 27 ‘Consolidated and Separate Financial 
Statements’, responds to queries regarding initial measurement of 
cost in separate financial statements of a new parent formed as a 
result of a specific type of reorganisation.
IFRIC 16 ‘Hedges of a Net Investment in a Foreign Operation’, 
provides guidance on identifying the foreign currency risks that 
qualify as a hedged risk in the hedge of a net investment in a 
foreign operation.
IFRIC 13 ‘Customer Loyalty Programmes’, addresses accounting 
by entities that grant loyalty awards credits to customers who 
provide goods or services.
Amendment to IFRS 2 ‘Share-Based Payment: Vesting 
Conditions and Cancellations’, clarifies the term ‘vesting 
conditions’ and provides the accounting treatment for non-vesting 
conditions and cancellations.
IAS 23 ‘Borrowing Costs’, removes the option of recognising 
immediately as an expense those borrowing costs that relate to 
assets that take a substantial period of time to get ready for use 
or sale.
At the date of authorisation of these financial statements, the 
following Standards and Interpretations which have not yet been 
applied by the Group were in issue but not yet effective or 
authorised by the European Union.
Amendment to IAS 32 ‘Financial Instruments: Presentation: 
Classification of Rights Issue’, Amendments to IFRIC 9 and IAS 39 
‘Embedded Derivatives’, IFRIC 17 ‘Distributions of Non-Cash 
Assets to Owners’, Amendment to IAS 39 ‘Financial Instruments: 
Recognition and Measurement: Eligible Hedged Items’, Revised 
IFRS 3 ‘Business Combinations’, IFRS 9 ‘Financial Instruments’, 
Amendment to IFRIC 14 ‘Prepayments of a Minimum Funding 
Requirement’, IFRIC 19 ‘Extinguishing Financial Liabilities with 
Equity Instruments’, Amendment to IFRS 2 ‘Group Cash-settled 
Share-based Payment Transactions’, Revised IAS 24 ‘Related 
Party Disclosures’ and Improvements to IFRSs.
A summary of the principal Group accounting policies are set out 
below and in the notes to the financial statements. These policies 
have been consistently applied to all periods presented unless 
otherwise stated.
The financial statements have been prepared under the historical 
cost convention as modified by the revaluation of certain items as 
required by IFRS.
In preparing the financial statements set out on the previous 
pages, the Group has complied with the UK Listing Authority 
requirements and has presented a comparative balance sheet  
at 31 March 2009.
Basis of Consolidation
The consolidated accounts comprise the accounts of  
The BSS Group plc and all its subsidiaries at 31 March 2010.  
The purchase method of accounting is used to account for the 
acquisition of the subsidiaries by the Group. Subsidiary trading 
results are fully consolidated from the date on which control is 
transferred to the Group. They are de-consolidated from the date 
that control ceases.
Revenue recognition
Revenue represents the value of goods sold arising primarily in the 
United Kingdom and Ireland excluding intra-group sales and value 
added tax. Revenue is recognised when the risks and rewards of 
ownership of the goods has been transferred to the customer. The 
risks and rewards of ownership of the goods are deemed to have 
been transferred when the goods are despatched to, or picked up 
by, the customer.
Functional currency
With the exception of BSS (Ireland) Limited, who conduct 
business in the Republic of Ireland, the principal place of 
operation is the United Kingdom. Consequently the financial 
statements are presented in GBP (Pounds Sterling).
Foreign currency translation
The monetary assets and liabilities of BSS (Ireland) Limited are 
translated at the closing rate at the balance sheet date and its 
income and expenses at the average rate for the year. Differences 
arising from these translations are recognised as a separate 
component of equity in the consolidated financial statements.
Derivative financial instruments and hedging activities
The Group uses derivative financial instruments to hedge its 
exposure to interest rate and foreign exchange risks arising from 
financing activities.
Derivative financial instruments are stated at fair value. The fair 
value of the derivative financial instruments is the estimated 
amount the Group would receive or pay to terminate the derivative 
at the balance sheet date, taking into account current interest 
and exchange rates and the current credit-worthiness of 
the counterparties.
Statement of Accounting Policies
for The BSS Group plc Group accounts 56 57 The BSS Group plc Annual Report & Accounts 2010  The BSS Group plc Annual Report & Accounts 2010  56 57 The BSS Group plc Annual Report & Accounts 2010  The BSS Group plc Annual Report & Accounts 2010  
Derivative financial instruments and hedging  
activities (continued)
Changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments, that 
are designated and effective as hedges of the future variability of 
cash flows, are recognised directly in equity and the ineffective 
portion is recognised immediately in the income statement.
For an effective hedge of an exposure to changes in the fair value 
of a hedged item, the hedged item is adjusted for changes in fair 
value attributable to the risk being hedged with the corresponding 
entry in the income statement.
For derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting, any  
gains or losses arising from changes in fair value are taken to  
the income statement as they arise.
Foreign currency forward contracts are not designated 
effective hedges and so are marked to market at the balance 
sheet date, with any gains or losses being taken through the 
income statement.
The Group does not enter into speculative derivative contracts.
Financial assets and financial liabilities
Financial assets are classified into the following specified 
categories: financial assets at fair value through profit or loss 
(‘FVTPL ’), available-for-sale (‘AFS’) financial assets and loans and 
receivables. The classification depends on the nature and 
purpose of the financial assets and is determined at the time  
of initial recognition.
Financial liabilities are classified as either financial liabilities at 
FVTPL or other financial liabilities. The Group has defined the 
classes of financial assets and financial liabilities to be other 
financial assets, loans and receivables including cash, borrowings, 
derivative financial instruments and trade and other payables.
(a) Financial assets and financial liabilities at FVTPL
Financial assets and financial liabilities are classified as at FVTPL 
where the financial asset or financial liability is either held for 
trading or it is designated as a FVTPL.
A financial asset or financial liability is classified as held for trading if:
It has been acquired principally for the purpose of selling or of •	
disposal in the near future
It is a part of an identified portfolio of financial instruments that •	
the Group manages together and has a recent actual pattern 
of short-term profit-taking
It is a derivative that is not designated and effective as a •	
hedging instrument
Financial assets and financial liabilities at FVTPL are stated at 
fair value, with any resultant gain or loss recognised in the 
income statement unless it is in an effective hedging relationship. 
The net gain or loss recognised in the Income Statement 
incorporates any interest earned or paid on the financial asset 
and financial liability respectively.
(b) Loans and receivables
Trade receivables and other receivables that have fixed or 
determinable payments that are not quoted in an active market 
are classified as loans and receivables. Loans and receivables are 
measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method, 
less any impairment. Interest income is recognised by applying 
the effective interest rate, except for short-term receivables which 
applies to all amounts owed to the Group when the recognition of 
interest would be immaterial.
(c) Other financial liabilities
Other financial liabilities, including borrowings, are initially 
measured at fair value, net of transaction costs. Other financial 
liabilities are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the 
effective interest method, with interest expense recognised on an 
effective yield basis. The effective interest method is a method of 
calculating the amortised cost of a financial liability and of 
allocating interest expense over the relevant period. The effective 
interest is the rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash 
payments through the expected life of the financial liability, or 
where appropriate a shorter period.
(d) Derecognition of financial assets and financial liabilities
The Group derecognises a financial asset only when the 
contractual rights to the cash flows from the asset expire; or it 
transfers the financial asset and substantially all the risks and 
rewards of ownership of the asset to another entity. If the Group 
neither transfers nor retains substantially all the risks and rewards 
of ownership and continues to control the transferred asset, the 
Group recognises its retained interest in the asset and an 
associated liability for amounts it may have to pay. If the Group 
retains substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of a 
transferred financial asset, the Group continues to recognise the 
financial asset and also recognises a collateralised borrowing for 
the proceeds received.
The Group derecognises financial liabilities when the Group’s 
obligations are discharged, cancelled or they expire.
Leases
Assets acquired under finance leases, where substantially all the 
risks and benefits incidental to ownership are transferred to the 
Group, are capitalised in property, plant and equipment. 
Depreciation is provided at rates designed to write-off the cost in 
equal annual amounts over the shorter of the estimated useful 
lives of the assets and the period of the leases. Leases where the 
lessor retains substantially all the risks and benefits of ownership 
of the asset are classified as operating leases. Operating lease 
payments are charged to the Income Statement as incurred.
Property, plant and equipment
Property, plant and equipment are included at cost less 
depreciation or impairment. Depreciation is provided on a 
straight line basis to allocate the cost less residual value over 
the estimated useful life of the asset and is provided at the 
following rates:
Freehold land Nil
Freehold properties and long leasehold  Lesser of 2% of cost or 
over the lease term
Short leasehold properties – tenant’s 
improvements 10% of cost
Plant, vehicles and other equipment 10% to 35% of cost
The assets residual values and useful lives are reviewed and 
adjusted if appropriate at each balance sheet date.
Borrowing costs
Borrowing costs specifically and directly attributable to the 
acquisition or construction of assets that necessarily take a 
substantial period of time to get ready for their intended use or 
sale, are added to the cost of those assets, until such time as  
the assets are substantially ready for their intended use or sale.
Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents comprises cash balances excluding 
bank overdrafts.

Intangible assets
(a) Goodwill
Goodwill represents the excess of the cost of an acquisition over 
the fair value of the Group’s share of the net identifiable assets of 
the acquired subsidiary/associate at the date of acquisition. If the 
cost of acquisition is less than the fair value of the net assets of 
the subsidiary acquired, the difference is recognised directly in  
the income statement.
Goodwill is tested annually for impairment and carried at cost less 
accumulated impairment losses. Goodwill is allocated to cash-
generating units for the purpose of impairment testing. The 
allocation of the goodwill is made to the lowest level of cash-
generating units or group of cash-generating units which are 
monitored by management and benefit from the acquisition on 
which the goodwill arose.
Gains and losses on the disposal of an entity include the carrying 
amount of goodwill relating to the entity sold not previously written 
off to reserves.
(b) Computer software
Costs that are directly associated with the development of 
identifiable and unique software products that will probably 
generate economic benefits for the Group beyond one year, are 
recognised as intangible assets. Computer software development 
costs recognised as assets and acquired computer software 
licences are amortised over their estimated useful lives  
(3 to 10 years) and is provided at between 10% and 33% of cost.
(c) Acquired assets
Intangible assets identified as part of the assets of an acquired 
business are capitalised separately from goodwill if the fair value 
can be measured reliably on initial recognition. Intangible assets 
are amortised to the income statement over the useful life of the 
assets acquired except where they are considered to have an 
indefinite useful life. All acquired intangible assets are reviewed 
annually for impairment and whenever there is an indication that 
the asset may be impaired.
Investment in joint venture
The results and assets and liabilities of the joint venture are 
incorporated in the financial statements using the equity method 
of accounting. The Consolidated Income Statement includes the 
Group’s share of the joint venture’s profits less losses while the 
Group’s share of the net assets of the joint venture is shown in  
the Consolidated Balance Sheet.
Employee benefit costs
(a) Pension schemes
Group companies operate various pension schemes. 
Contributions to the Group’s defined benefit pension schemes are 
charged in accordance with the advice of the Group’s actuaries, 
so as to spread the cost of pensions over the anticipated service 
lives of scheme members. As permitted under IAS 19 (revised), 
actuarial surpluses and deficits are recognised immediately in the 
statement of comprehensive income.
Contributions to defined contribution pension schemes are 
charged to the income statement as incurred.
(b) Share-based compensation
The Group operates various equity settled share option schemes. 
The value of the employee services is determined by reference to 
the fair value of the options granted using the Black-Scholes 
valuation model. This value is then expensed in the Income 
Statement in the period between grant date and vesting date 
(vesting period). At each balance sheet date, the Group revises 
its estimates of the number of options expected to be exercised. 
Any net proceeds are credited to equity when the options 
are exercised.
Inventories
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value, 
after adjusting for impairment (for obsolete and slow moving items) 
and are calculated on a first in first out basis.
Costs comprise direct materials and where appropriate a 
proportion of attributable overheads, supplier rebates and 
discounts. Net realisable value is the estimated selling price less 
further costs expected to be incurred to completion and disposal.
Trade receivables
Trade receivables are recognised at the value of the sale of goods 
or services on the date of the transaction. Subsequently trade 
receivables are reduced when objective evidence exists that the 
Group will not be able to collect all amounts due according to the 
original terms of the receivables.
Taxation
The current taxation charge in the income statement is based on 
the profit for the year as adjusted for disallowable and non taxable 
items using current rates.
Deferred income tax is provided in full, using the liability method, 
on temporary differences arising between the tax bases of assets 
and liabilities and their carrying amounts in the consolidated 
financial statements. Deferred income tax is determined using tax 
rates that are expected to apply when the related deferred income 
tax asset is realised or the deferred income tax liability is settled.
Deferred income tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is 
probable that future taxable profit will be available against which 
the temporary differences can be utilised.
Significant and exceptional items
Items that are both material and non-recurring and whose 
significance is sufficient to warrant separate disclosure and 
identification within the financial statements are referred to as 
exceptional items and disclosed within their relevant Consolidated 
Income Statement category. 
2009 balance sheet restatement
The Group has restated financial assets and borrowings 
for March 2009 to include the impact of derivative financial 
instruments in conjunction with the US$ Loan notes on a  
gross basis from a net basis.
Critical Accounting Estimates
The preparation of the financial statements in compliance with 
IFRS require management to make estimates and assumptions 
that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date 
of the financial statements and revenue and expenses during the 
period. Management evaluates its estimates on an ongoing basis 
using historical experience, consultation with experts and other 
assumptions that it believes reasonable. The Audit Committee 
have been party to discussions about the development, selection 
and disclosure of the Group’s critical accounting policies and 
estimates and about their actual application. The Group’s most 
sensitive estimates are discussed over the page. 58 59 The BSS Group plc Annual Report & Accounts 2010  The BSS Group plc Annual Report & Accounts 2010  58 59 The BSS Group plc Annual Report & Accounts 2010  The BSS Group plc Annual Report & Accounts 2010  
Inventories
As required by financial reporting standards, the Group continually 
evaluates its stock holding to ensure that it is carried at the lower 
of cost or net realisable value. Provisions are made against 
damaged, slow moving and obsolete inventories. As damaged 
inventories are identified their value is written down through  
each Division’s inventory counting procedure. Slow moving and 
obsolete inventories are assessed by each Division during 
standard reporting procedures and again by Group management 
for statutory reporting. Obsolescence is considered by comparing 
future sales with current levels of inventory holding. External 
factors will also influence this estimate as new legislation, trends, 
or manufacturers withdrawing product lines might render certain 
inventories obsolete ahead of any reasonable expectations. The 
extent to which these external factors influence the profitability of 
inventory will determine the significance of any provision variance.
As at 31 March 2010 the Group had inventory provision of £10.7m 
(2009: £10.4m).
Allowance for doubtful debts
The Group makes provisions for debts that management 
estimates may become impaired. Each division makes monthly 
assessments on the recoverability of all its accounts based on 
external factors such as the creditworthiness of the customer, 
prevailing market conditions and the age of the receivable. A 
detailed formal review is undertaken at half and full year to ensure 
that all provision balances are fair and accurate. If the Group  
has been cautious in assessing the financial conditions of the 
customer and its ability to pay, then amounts that have been 
provided for may subsequently be recovered. Likewise if the 
Group has been optimistic then amounts expected to be 
recovered and therefore not provided for may subsequently  
be deemed irrecoverable.
As at 31 March 2010 the Group had a provision for doubtful debts 
of £7.9m (2009: £8.0m).
Long-lived assets
Management review long-lived assets for impairment on an annual 
basis. Determining whether impairment has occurred typically 
requires various estimates and assumptions, including 
determining which cash flows are directly related to the potentially 
impaired asset, the useful life over which cash flows will occur, 
their amount, and the asset’s residual value, if any. In turn, 
measurement of an impairment loss requires a determination  
of fair value, which is based on the best information available. 
Management use internal discounted cash flow estimates, quoted 
market prices when available and independent appraisals as 
appropriate to determine fair value. Management derive the 
required cash flow estimates from historical experience and 
internal business plans and apply an appropriate discount rate.
Pension liabilities
The Group operates various defined benefit pension schemes, all 
of which are closed to new members. These are accounted for 
using methods that rely on actuarial assumptions to estimate  
the value of liabilities and amount of costs to be included in the 
financial statements. The actuarial assumptions include discount 
rates, assumed rate of return, future salary and pension increases 
and employee turnover rates. While management believe that the 
actuarial assumptions are suitable, any significant change to those 
would affect the balance sheet and income statement.
Property leases
The Group holds a number of leases on properties which are no 
longer used for trading. The Group has recently been successful 
in sub-letting a number of properties but despite all efforts this is 
sometimes not possible. Where a lease is onerous to the Group, a 
provision is recognised in the accounts as the difference between 
the amounts contractually owed to the landlord and the amount 
contractually receivable (if any) from the tenant for the period up 
until the lease is judged to be no longer onerous. Estimates are 
based on the current condition of the UK property market and 
advice from external advisors and management believe that they 
are appropriate. It may be possible that a lease takes longer than 
anticipated to dispose of resulting in an understatement of the 
provision. If this is the case, management do no believe it likely  
to be material.

1 Segmental information
The Chief Operating Decision Maker (‘CODM’), who is responsible for allocating resources and assessing performance of the operating 
segments, has been identified as the Board. IFRS 8 requires operating segments to be identified on the basis of internal reports that are 
regularly reviewed by the Board to allocate resources and assess their performance. The business is organised around differences in 
products and services. Where areas of the business have common characteristics, segments have been aggregated appropriately.
The Group’s reportable segments and their activities are listed below:
The Domestic Division supplies a comprehensive range of sanitaryware, heating and plumbing products to a variety of customers, 
both public and private sector, from large national contractors to sole trading plumbers and heating engineers through its extensive 
branch network.
The Industrial Division is the market leader in the UK supply and distribution of pipeline, process, heating and mechanical services 
equipment. Its customers range from large national contractors to local independents.
The Specialist Division supplies a range of power tools, hand tools, maintenance and health and safety products to three principal 
market sectors, the manufacturing industry, wholesale and trade customers. The Division uses its key capabilities, industry leading 
catalogues, web and vendor managed inventory solutions, in order to maximise service to its customers.

All inter-segment sales/transfers are transacted on an arm’s length basis. The accounting policies of the reportable segments are the 
same as the Group’s accounting policies. Segment profit represents the profit earned by each segment without allocation of corporate 
and head office costs, investment revenue and finance costs and income tax expense as reported to the Board.
The Board monitor the tangible and intangibles assets and working capital of each segment. Segment assets include property, plant 
and equipment, goodwill, inventories and trade receivables and exclude deferred taxation. Segment liabilities comprise operating 
liabilities and exclude taxation, borrowings and retirement benefit liabilities.

4 Pension schemes
Defined benefit schemes
The Group operates three defined benefit pension schemes based on final pensionable salary. The assets of the schemes are held 
separately from those of the Group in funds under the control of the trustees. All defined benefit schemes are closed to new members. 
The most recent actuarial valuations of the scheme assets and the present value of the defined benefit obligation were carried out at 
1 June 2009 for the main UK and Irish schemes and 31 December 2008 for the secondary UK scheme. The present value of the 
defined benefit obligation, and the related current service cost and past service cost, were measured using the projected unit method 
with a control period equal to the future working lifetime of the active members. On 1 April 2008, the main UK scheme became a salary 
sacrifice scheme (with membership being on an opt out basis), whereby the Group contributes into the scheme on behalf of the 
employees. On 1 January 2009, the second UK scheme also became a salary sacrifice scheme, again on an opt out basis. The 
employer contributed an extra £1.6m above its scheduled contributions in the year (2009: £nil) in order not to disinvest funds from  
its equity holding whilst the stock markets were recovering from the economic slow down. 
Defined contribution schemes
The Group operates two defined contribution schemes for all qualifying employees. The assets of the schemes are held separately  
from those of the Group in funds under the control of the scheme administrators. On 1 January 2009, the UK scheme became a salary 
sacrifice scheme (on an opt out basis), whereby the Group contributes into the scheme on behalf of the employees. During the year, the 
Group contributed £1.9m (2009: £1.2m) to the defined contribution schemes. The outstanding contributions as at 31 March 2010 were 
£nil (2009: £nil).
The principal assumptions used for the purpose of the actuarial valuations were as follows:
       2010 2009 
       % %
Discount rate       5.60 6.60
Expected return on scheme assets       7.40 8.05
Future salary increases       3.50* 3.85
1
Future pension increases       3.25 2.85
Inflation       3.50 2.85
Proportion of employees opting for early retirement       Nil Nil
1
 1.25% (2009:1.95%) for next three years reverting to 3.50% (2009: 3.85%) after this period.
A 0.25% increase in the discount rate would decrease the deficit by £9.1m and a 0.25% decrease in the discount rate would increase 
the deficit by £9.6m.
The life expectancy assumptions used to estimate defined benefit liabilities at 31 March are:
       2010 2009
Current pensioners (at age 65) – male       21.7 21.7
Current pensioners (at age 65) – female       24.1 24.1
Future pensioners (at age 65) – male       22.7 22.7
Future pensioners (at age 65) – female       24.9 24.9

The change in the scheme deficit is primarily due to an increase in inflation and decreasing AA corporate bond yields. This has been 
offset by a better than expected investment performance driven by the recovery in the equity markets. The cumulative gain recognised 
in the statement of comprehensive income is £20.3m (2009: £18.3m).

The actual gain/(loss) on scheme assets over 2010 was £51.1m (2009: £(34.8)m).
The scheme assets do not include any of the Group’s own financial instruments, nor any property occupied by, or other assets used by 
the Group.
The expected rates of return on individual categories of scheme assets are determined by reference to relevant indices published by the 
London Stock Exchange. The overall expected rate of return is calculated by weighting the individual rates in accordance with the 
anticipated balance in the schemes’ investment portfolio.

The Group expects to contribute approximately £6.3m to its defined benefit schemes in 2011 and will additionally meet the expenses of 
operating the scheme including any levies payable to the Board of the Pension Protection Fund.

In addition the Directors are proposing a final dividend in respect of the financial year ending 31 March 2010 of 6.09 pence per share 
which will absorb an estimated £7.6m of shareholders’ funds. It will be paid on 30 July 2010 to shareholders who are on the register  
of members on 2 July 2010.
There are no income tax consequences in respect of the dividends declared, but not recognised in the financial statements.
8 Earnings per share
Basic earnings per share is calculated by dividing the earnings attributable to ordinary shareholders by the weighted average number  
of Ordinary Shares outstanding during the year excluding those held as Treasury shares which are treated as cancelled.
For diluted earnings per share, the weighted average number of Ordinary Shares in issue is adjusted to assume conversion of all dilutive 
potential Ordinary Shares. The Group has one class of dilutive potential Ordinary Shares: those share options granted to employees 
where the exercise price is less than the average market price of the Company’s Ordinary Shares during the period.
Reconciliations of the earnings and weighted average number of shares used in the calculations are set out below.

(i)  Other changes relate to the reallocation of goodwill as intangible assets in the prior year and movements in fair value adjustments on prior year acquisitions, after further 
review of the assets acquired as part of the acquisitions were undertaken.
Impairment review
During the year management has carried out an impairment review for the goodwill carried in the balance sheet. No impairments were 
identified as a result of the review. All of the recoverable amounts were based on value in use.
The key assumptions applied in the value in use calculations were:
–  cash flow projections are based on Board approved budgets for the financial year ending 2011 and three year plan for 2011 to 2013
–  long term growth rates of between 2 and 4%, in line with Government GDP forecast growth rates
–  a pre tax discount rate of 5.00% (2009: 4.02%) which has been applied to each cash-generating unit as they each have a similar 
risk profile
–  there are three cash-generating units which are disclosed in the segmental information note
The Directors are confident that the assumptions used above are reasonable, although it is possible that an impairment would be 
identified if any of the assumptions were amended significantly.

A. Warren & Sons Limited, BuckHickman InOne, Birchwood Group Holdings Limited, Direct Heating Spares Limited and UGS Limited.
 Included within this balance is £6.6m attributed to the BuckHickman InOne brand name Roebuck, and £3.9m attributed to the Birchwood brands, Defender, Scruffs,  
Van Vault and Rhino, which are considered to have an indefinite life.
 The Roebuck brand name has been trading for over a 100 years and therefore it is considered to have an indefinite life and is reviewed annually for impairment. The 
Birchwood brand names have been trading for over 20 years and the product lines are consistently updated to meet market demands. Therefore the brands are considered 
to have an indefinite life and are reviewed annually for impairment. The key assumptions for impairment reviews are in note 9.

The average credit period on sales of goods is 59 days (2009: 59 days). No interest is charged on the trade receivables for the first 
60 days from the date of the invoice. Thereafter, the Group reserves the right to charge interest at 2% per annum above the UK clearing 
bank base lending rate on the outstanding balance until payment is received in full. Trade receivables are provided for based on 
estimated irrecoverable amounts from the sale of goods, determined by the Group’s management based on prior experience and their 
assessment of the current economic environment.
Before accepting any new customer the Group uses a bespoke credit scoring system, designed in house and tailored specifically for the 
industry which is backed up by an external Credit Reference Agency, to assess the potential customer’s credit quality. The Group reserves 
the right to set credit limits by customer. Of the trade receivables balance at the end of the year, £8.5m (2009: £7.4m) is due from the 
Group’s largest customer. There are no customers who represent more than 5% of the total balance of trade receivables.

In determining the recoverability of a trade receivable, the Group considers any change in the credit quality of the trade receivable from 
the date credit was initially granted up to the reporting date. The concentration of credit risk is limited as the Group’s exposure is spread 
over a large number of customers. Included in the allowance for doubtful debts are individually impaired trade receivables with a 
balance of £0.9m (2009: £1.0m) which have been placed under liquidation. The impairment recognised represents the difference 
between the carrying amount of these trade receivables and the present value of the expected liquidation proceeds. The Group does 
not hold any collateral over these balances.

(f) US$ Loan notes
On 11 May 2006 the Group finalised a US private placement that resulted in it receiving $125m and repaying the Sterling equivalent 
outstanding on the revolving credit facility. Of the new borrowing, $75m is repayable in May 2013 with the remaining $50m repayable  
in May 2016. In order to protect itself against currency movements and interest rate exposures, the Group entered into three cross 
currency and three interest rate swaps.
(g) Fair values
For both the Group and the Company the fair values of the financial assets and liabilities have been calculated by discounting expected 
cash flows at prevailing rates at 31 March. There were no significant differences between book and fair values on this basis and 
therefore no further information is disclosed with the exception of the US$ Loan notes. Movements in the fair value of the related 
financial instruments used to hedge against interest and currency risk are disclosed in note 16.
(h) Guarantees and security
No debt is secured, except for that relating to £0.3m (2009: £0.1m) of finance lease obligations, which are secured on the assets subject 
to the leases. There are cross guarantees on the overdrafts and ancillary banking facilities between the Group companies. 72 73 The BSS Group plc Annual Report & Accounts 2010  The BSS Group plc Annual Report & Accounts 2010  72 73 The BSS Group plc Annual Report & Accounts 2010  The BSS Group plc Annual Report & Accounts 2010

Details of significant accounting policies and methods of valuation adopted by the Group in respect of each class of financial asset, 
financial liability and equity instrument are disclosed in the Statement of Accounting Policies on page 56.
Capital risk management
The Group manages its capital to ensure that entities in the Group will be able to continue as a going concern while maximising the 
return to stakeholders through the optimisation of the debt and equity balance.
The capital structure of the Group consists of debt, which includes the borrowings disclosed in note 15, cash and cash equivalents and 
equity attributable to equity holders of the parent, comprising issued capital, reserves and retained earnings as disclosed in notes 19, 
21 and 22 respectively.
The Group’s senior management team review the capital structure on an ongoing basis. As part of this review, the cost of capital and 
the risks associated with each class of capital are considered. Based upon these reviews the structure of the capital can be altered by 
payment of dividends, new share issues, share buy-backs or by issuing or repaying debt.
 The Group has set limits which are approved by the shareholders for the number of shares that can be allotted within a five year period.
The compliance with this limit is reviewed by the Board prior to any new grant of share options taking place. The Group also has limits 
approved by the shareholders for share buy-backs or rights issues. The Articles of Association limit the amount of borrowings the Group 
has at any one time to two times the adjusted net assets of the Group. Through the covenants set out in the RCF agreement and US 
loan note agreements, the maximum amount of borrowings the Group can have outstanding is limited. Compliance with the covenants 
is monitored on a half yearly basis or in conjunction with a significant change in the business.

Fair value of financial instruments
The carrying amount of financial assets recorded in the financial statements, which is net of impairment losses, represents the Group’s 
maximum exposure to credit risk.
The fair value of financial assets and financial liabilities are determined as follows:
The fair value of financial assets and financial liabilities with standard terms and conditions and traded on active liquid markets are •	
determined with reference to quoted market prices
The fair value of other financial assets and financial liabilities (excluding derivative instruments) are determined in accordance with •	
generally accepted pricing models based upon discounted cash flow analysis using prices from observable current market 
transactions
The fair value of derivative instruments are calculated using quoted prices. Where such prices are not available use is made of •	
discounted cash flow analysis using the applicable yield curve for the duration of the instruments for non-optional derivatives, and 
option pricing models for optional derivatives
The following table provides an analysis of financial instruments that are measured subsequent to initial recognition at fair value, 
grouped into Levels 1 to 3 based on the degree to which the fair value is observable:
Level 1 fair value measurements are those derived from quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities; •	
Level 2 fair value measurements are those derived from inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable •	
for the asset or liability either directly (i.e. as prices) or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices);
Level 3 fair value measurements are those derived from valuation techniques that include inputs for the asset or liability that are not •	
based on observable market data (unobservable inputs).
There were no transfers between levels during the year.

Financial risk management
The Group’s Treasury function provides services to the business, monitoring and managing the financial risks relating to the operations 
of the Group through internal risk reports. These risks include currency risk, interest rate risk, credit risk and liquidity risk. The Group 
seeks to minimise the effects of these risks by using derivative financial instruments to hedge the exposures where necessary. The use 
of financial derivatives is governed by the Group’s treasury policies developed in conjunction with the Board. Compliance with the 
policies and exposure limits is reviewed by the Board on a continuous basis by quarterly reports from the Treasury function and monthly 
Credit Committee meetings. The Group does not enter into or trade financial instruments for speculative purposes. 
Interest rate management
The Group is exposed to interest rate risk as entities in the Group borrow funds at both fixed and floating interest rates. The risk is 
managed by the Group by maintaining an appropriate mix between fixed and floating rate borrowings, by the use of interest rate swap 
contracts and forward interest rate contracts. Hedging activities are evaluated regularly to align with interest rate views and defined risk 
appetite, ensuring optimal hedging strategies are applied, by either positioning the balance sheet or protecting interest expense  
through different interest rate cycles.
The Group’s exposure to interest rates on financial assets and financial liabilities are detailed in the liquidity risk management section.
Interest rate swap contracts
Under interest rate swap contracts, the Group agrees to exchange the difference between fixed and floating interest rate amounts 
calculated on agreed notional principal amounts. Such contracts enable the Group to mitigate the risk of changing interest rates on the 
fair value of issued fixed rate debt held and the cash flow exposures on the issued variable rate debt held. The fair value of interest rate 
swaps at the reporting date is determined by discounting the future cash flows using the curves at the reporting date and the credit risk 
inherent in the contract, and is disclosed below. The average interest rate is based on the outstanding balances at the end of the 
financial year.
The following table details the notional principal amounts and the remaining terms of interest rate swap contracts as at the reporting date:

Two – five years    1.49   5.07   43.1   43.1  11.3   15.7 
The interest rate swaps settle on a half yearly basis. The floating rate on the interest rate swaps is six month LIBOR. The Group will 
settle the difference between the fixed and floating interest rate on a net basis. 
The interest rate swaps manage the Group’s exposure to the fixed interest rate on the US Dollar denominated borrowing arising out of a 
private placement on 11 May 2006.
There are two interest rate swaps on the seven year borrowing of £29m and £14m that convert the borrowings on $50m and $25m 
respectively from 5.8% to a variable rate on six month LIBOR plus a basis point increment of 64.75 and 66.79 respectively. A further 
interest rate swap on the ten year borrowing of £29m converts the borrowing on the $50m debt from 5.91% to a fixed rate of 4.7% plus 
a basis point increment of 70.75.
The interest rate swap contracts exchanging fixed rate interest for floating rate interest are designated and effective as fair value hedges 
in respect of interest rates. During the period, the hedge was 100% effective in hedging the fair value exposure to interest movements 
and as a result, the carrying amount of the loan was adjusted by £4.7m (2009: £(18.0)m), which was included in profit or loss at the 
same time that the fair value of the interest rate swap £(4.4)m (2009: £18.1m) was included in profit or loss.

16 Derivative and non-current financial instruments (continued)
The interest rate swaps settle on a half yearly basis. The Group will settle the difference between the fixed and fixed interest on a net 
basis. All interest rate swap contracts exchanging fixed rate interest amounts for fixed rate interest amounts are designated as cash flow 
hedges in order to reduce the Group’s cash flow exposure resulting from movements in exchange rates. The interest rate swaps and the 
interest rate payments on the loan occur simultaneously and the amount deferred in equity is recognised in profit or loss over the period 
that the floating rate interest payments on debt impact profit or loss.
At 31 March 2010 the fair value of interest rate derivatives, all of which terminate after more than five years from the balance sheet date, 
was estimated at £5.8m (2009: £9.8m). This amount is based upon the market values of equivalent financial instruments at the balance 
sheet date. All of these interest rate swaps are designated and effective as cash flow hedges and the fair value thereof deferred in equity.
Foreign currency risk management 
In order to eliminate the currency risk associated with the private placing of $125m, the Group has entered into three cross currency 
swaps to fix the exchange rate at £1 equal to $1.73 for the entire duration of the private placement. The forward options fix the notional 
amount receivable and payable in respect of the private placement to £72m as well as fixing the exchange rates applicable to future 
coupon payments.
The Group acquires goods for sale from overseas, which when not denominated in Sterling are paid for principally in US Dollars and 
Euros. The Group has entered into forward foreign exchange contracts (all of which are less than twelve months in duration) to buy  
US Dollars and Euros to hedge the exchange risk arising from these anticipated future purchases. At the balance sheet date the total 
notional value of contracts to which the Group was committed was US$1.2m and €nil (2009: US$5.5m and €0.4m). The average 
exchange rate of the US Dollar contracts is 1.509 (2009: 1.487) and the Euro contracts is nil (2009: 1.115).
The fair value of these derivatives is £nil (2009: £0.1m and £nil respectively).
These contracts have not been designated as hedges and accordingly the fair value movement has been reflected in the income statement.
Liquidity risk management
The Board has established an appropriate liquidity risk management framework for management of the Group’s short, medium  
and long term funding requirements. The Group manages the risk by maintaining adequate reserves, banking facilities and reserve 
borrowing facilities by continuously monitoring forecast and actual cash flows and matching the maturity profiles of financial assets 
and financial liabilities. Included in note 15 is a list of additional undrawn committed facilities that the Group has to further reduce 
liquidity risk.
The following tables detail the Group’s liquidity analysis for its derivative financial instruments. The table has been drawn up based on 
the undiscounted net cash inflows / (outflows) on the derivative instrument that settle on a net basis and the undiscounted gross inflows/ 
(outflows) on those derivatives that require gross settlement. When the amount payable or receivable is not fixed, the amount disclosed 
has been determined by reference to the projected interest and foreign currency rates as illustrated by the yield curves existing at the 
reporting date.

Interest rate sensitivity analysis
The sensitivity analysis below has been determined based upon the exposure to interest rates for both derivative and non-derivative 
financial instruments at the balance sheet date. A 1.0% increase or decrease is used when reporting interest rate risk internally to senior 
management and represents the Directors’ assessment of the reasonably possible change in interest rates. If the interest rates had 
been 1.0% higher/lower and all other variables were held constant, the Group’s:
Profit for the year ended 31 March 2010 would have decreased/increased by £1.0m (2009: decreased/increased by £1.2m) •	
Net equity would have decreased/increased by £1.0m (2009: decreased/increased by £1.2m) •	
Other derivatives
The BSS Group plc has reviewed all contracts for embedded derivatives that are required to be separately accounted for. No embedded 
derivatives existed as at 31 March 2010 (2009: £nil).

The Group has recognised a deferred tax asset of £7.4m (2009: £8.7m) in respect of the deficits on its defined benefit pension schemes. 
The Directors believe that the deferred tax asset will be realised as the deficits are reduced over the coming years.
The Group also has an unrecognised deferred tax asset of £0.1m in respect of capital losses with no expiry date. However, due to 
restrictions on how these losses can be used, the Directors do not believe it is probable that these losses will be utilised in the 
foreseeable future. In addition, the Group has an unrecognised deferred tax asset of £0.7m in respect of trading losses relating to  
UGS Ltd with no expiry date, due to potential restrictions on how these losses can be used.

The onerous lease provision relates to future rent which is contractually due to be paid on vacant leasehold properties, after taking into 
account existing sub-tenant arrangements.
The property dilapidation provision represents the estimated costs of dilapidation repairs which have arisen over the period of the 
Group’s occupation of leasehold property, the liability for which is contained in a tenancy agreement. Provision is only made where the 
repair can be legally enforced and it is likely that the obligation will result in a outflow of economic benefit.
These liabilities will crystallise over the period of the lease. The property dilapidation provision is for properties which have a remaining lease 
period of up to three years. The onerous lease provision is for properties with a remaining lease period of between one and six years.

Options were valued using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. No performance conditions were included in the fair value 
calculations. The inputs into the model expressed as weighted averages are as follows:

     Executive  Executive SAYE SAYE 
     options options options options
Share price at grant date (pence)     241.9 243.7 306.4 260.8

Risk free interest rate     4.2% 4.6% 4.4% 4.7%
Expected dividends expressed as a dividend yield     2.3% 2.3% 2.0% 2.2%
The expected volatility is based on historical share prices over a period of time equal to the vesting period. The option life used is the average 
expected period to exercise, based upon historic patterns where appropriate. The risk free interest rate of return is the yield on zero-coupon 
UK government bonds on a term consistent with the assumed option life. Dividends used are based on actual dividends where data is 
known and future dividends based upon a 10% growth in dividends policy. Also assumed is that performance conditions in respect of the 
executive share options will be met and that 0% of the 2007 , 0% of the 2008 and 50% of the 2009 performance share plan will vest.

Share premium account has arisen as a result of premiums obtained on issues of shares by the Group in current and prior years.
In the current year 871,249 (2009: 630,866) shares were issued under employee share option schemes resulting in the issue of £nil
(2009: £0.1m) of share capital for a total consideration of £0.9m (2009: £0.6m). An additional £0.9m (2009: £0.7m) of share premium 
arose due to the issue of shares to employees via an Employee Benefit Trust (‘EBT’) that was funded by the Group, therefore no cash 
consideration was received by the Group.

The intangible assets are primarily the customer relationships. The goodwill arising is attributable to the anticipated profitability of the 
acquisition and the future operating synergies arising in the enlarged Group.
Since the date of the acquisition to 31 March 2010, Direct Heating Spares Limited have contributed £16.4m of gross revenue, £3.0m of 
net revenue to the Group and operating profit before intangible amortisation of £2.2m. As Direct Heating Spares Limited was acquired 
on 2 April 2009, the additional day of revenue and profits would not alter the disclosed revenue and profits of the Group as disclosed in 
these financial statements.
On 5 February 2010, the Group acquired 100% of the issued share capital of UGS Limited for a cash consideration of £0.9m. This 
resulted in goodwill and intangibles of £5.9m. Due to the date of the acquisition, the fair value adjustments are provisional and will only 
be finalised after detailed investigations are completed.

Respective responsibilities of Directors and auditors 
As explained more fully in the Statement of Directors 
Responsibilities set out on page 43, the Directors are responsible 
for the preparation of the Parent Company financial statements 
and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view. Our 
responsibility is to audit the Parent Company financial statements 
in accordance with applicable law and International Standards on 
Auditing (UK and Ireland). Those standards require us to comply 
with the Auditing Practices Board’s Ethical Standards for Auditors. 
This report, including the opinions, has been prepared for and 
only for the Company’s members as a body in accordance with 
Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies Act 2006 and for no other 
purpose. We do not, in giving these opinions, accept or assume 
responsibility for any other purpose or to any other person to 
whom this report is shown or into whose hands it may come save 
where expressly agreed by our prior consent in writing.
Scope of the audit of the financial statements
An audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts and 
disclosures in the financial statements sufficient to give reasonable 
assurance that the financial statements are free from material 
misstatement, whether caused by fraud or error. This includes an 
assessment of: whether the accounting policies are appropriate to 
the Parent Company’s circumstances and have been consistently 
applied and adequately disclosed; the reasonableness of 
significant accounting estimates made by the Directors; and the 
overall presentation of the financial statements.
Opinion on financial statements 
In our opinion the Parent Company financial statements: 
give a true and fair view of the state of the Company’s affairs as •	
at 31 March 2010;
have been properly prepared in accordance with United •	
Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice; and 
have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of •	
the Companies Act 2006.
Opinion on other matters prescribed by the  
Companies Act 2006 
In our opinion: 
the part of the Report of the Remuneration Committee to be •	
audited has been properly prepared in accordance with the 
Companies Act 2006; and 
the information given in the Report of the Directors for the •	
financial year for which the Parent Company financial 
statements are prepared is consistent with the Parent 
Company financial statements.
Matters on which we are required to report by exception 
We have nothing to report in respect of the following matters 
where the Companies Act 2006 requires us to report to you if,  
in our opinion: 
adequate accounting records have not been kept by the Parent •	
Company, or returns adequate for our audit have not been 
received from branches not visited by us; or 
the Parent Company financial statements and the part of the •	
Report of the Remuneration Committee to be audited are not 
in agreement with the accounting records and returns; or 
certain disclosures of Directors’ remuneration specified by law •	
are not made; or 
we have not received all the information and explanations we •	
require for our audit.

The BSS Group plc for the year ended 31 March 2010.

Company Balance Sheet
of The BSS Group plc as at 31 March 2010,  
prepared under UK GAAP 84 85 The BSS Group plc Annual Report & Accounts 2010  The BSS Group plc Annual Report & Accounts 2010  84 85 The BSS Group plc Annual Report & Accounts 2010  The BSS Group plc Annual Report & Accounts 2010  
Basis of accounting
The accounts have been prepared under UK GAAP using the 
historical cost convention modified by the revaluation of certain 
items as required by UK GAAP and in accordance with the 
Companies Act 2006 and applicable accounting standards.
 
The accounting policies adopted in these accounts are consistent 
with those used in previous years, except where new standards 
have been adopted as noted below.
Investments 
Investments in subsidiary undertakings and joint ventures are 
included in the financial statements at the lower of cost or net 
realisable value. In accordance with FRS11, the Company 
performs impairment reviews where there is an indication that  
the carrying amount of fixed asset investments may not be 
recoverable. Where it is established that an asset has been 
impaired, then an amount equal to the impairment is charged  
to the profit and loss account in the year of the impairment.
Deferred tax
Provision is made for deferred taxation in so far as a liability or 
asset arose as a result of transactions that had occurred by the 
balance sheet date and gave rise to an obligation to pay more tax 
in the future, or a right to pay less tax in the future with the 
following exception: Deferred tax assets are recognised only to 
the extent that the Directors consider that it is more likely than not 
that there will be suitable taxable profits from which the future 
reversal of the underlying timing differences can be deducted.
Deferred tax is measured on an undiscounted basis at the tax 
rates that are expected to apply in the periods in which timing 
differences reverse, based on tax rates and laws enacted or 
substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
Pension schemes
Contributions to the Group’s defined benefit pension schemes are 
charged in accordance with the advice of the Group’s actuaries, 
so as to spread the cost of pensions over the anticipated service 
lives of scheme members. Actuarial surpluses and deficits are 
spread forward over the average remaining service lives of 
scheme members.
Contributions to defined contribution pension schemes are 
charged to the profit and loss account as incurred.
Borrowings
Borrowings are carried at their issue proceeds net of finance 
costs, less amounts repaid. Finance costs are allocated over the 
term of the borrowings.
Share based benefits
The Group operates various share option schemes. The value of 
the employee services is determined by reference to the fair value 
of the options granted using the Black-Scholes valuation model. 
This value is then expensed in the profit and loss account in the 
period between grant date and vesting date (vesting period). At 
each balance sheet date, the Group revises its estimates of the 
number of options expected to be exercised. Any net proceeds 
are credited to equity when the options are exercised.
Derivative financial instruments and hedging activities
The Company also enters into derivative financial instrument and 
hedging activities for which the policy is the same as the Group as 
set out on page 55 and 56.
The Company has taken the exemption in FRS 29 ‘Financial 
Instruments: Disclosures’ as its financial statements are included 
in the publicly available consolidated financial statements of the 
Group, which include disclosures that comply with FRS 29.
Cash flow statement
The Company has not prepared a cash flow statement,  
as allowed by FRS 1 (Revised 1996) ‘Cash Flow Statements’,  
as its cash flows are included in the Group Consolidated Cash 
Flow Statement.

Unsolicited mail
As the Company’s share register is, by law, open to public inspection, shareholders may receive unsolicited mail from organisations that 
use it as a mailing list. Shareholders wishing to limit the amount of such mail should write to the Mailing Preference Society, Freepost 22, 
London W1E 7EZ.
Warning to shareholders
Over the last year or so many companies have become aware that their shareholders have received unsolicited phone calls or 
correspondence concerning investment matters. These are typically from overseas based ‘brokers’ who target UK shareholders 
offering to sell them what often turn out to be worthless or high risk shares in US or UK investments. They can be very persistent  
and extremely persuasive and a 2006 survey by the Financial Services Authority (‘FSA’) has reported that the average amount lost by 
investors is around £20,000. It is not just the novice investor that has been duped in this way; many of the victims had been successfully 
investing for several years. Shareholders are advised to be very wary of any unsolicited advice, offers to buy shares at a discount or 
offers of free company reports. If you receive any unsolicited investment advice:
Make sure you get the correct name of the person and organisation •	
Check that they are properly authorised by the FSA before getting involved •	
You can check at www.fsa.gov.uk/register on their website, the FSA also maintain a list of unauthorised overseas firms who are 
targeting, or have targeted, UK investors, and any approach from such organisations should be reported to the FSA so that this list can 
be kept up to date and any other appropriate action can be considered. If you deal with an unauthorised firm, you would not be eligible 
to receive payment under the Financial Services Compensation Scheme. If you have any further queries, you can contact Capita 
Registrars on 0871 664 0300 (calls cost 10p per minute plus network extras, lines are open from 8.30 am to 5.30 pm Mon – Fri).

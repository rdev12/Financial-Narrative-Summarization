Kier Construction has completed 
the Southend Pier Cultural Centre 
which is now open to the public 
ahead of an official opening this 
autumn. Built off-site at Tilbury 
Docks, the placing of the cultural 
centre onto the 120-year-old cast 
iron Southend Pier more than a mile 
out to sea presented the project 
team with a number of obstacles. 
The Kier team rose to the 
challenge with a fantastic result, 
and the new cultural centre has 
reinstated Southend’s most 
famous landmark by creating a 
vibrant public space on the pier 
from which to enjoy the landscape 
of the Thames Estuary.

Overview Financial statements Governance Financial review Corporate responsibility Operational review 02 —— Kier Group plc 
Overview
Our strategic
focus
Group strategy
A key element of Kier’s strategy is  
to be diverse and market-leading in  
its chosen businesses: Construction, 
Services and Property.
Our aim is to have strong, stand-alone 
businesses, able both to excel in strong 
markets and to be resilient when markets 
are weak. The cash flows generated by 
our Construction and Services businesses 
are invested in our Property business, 
where we aim to achieve in excess of  
a 15% return on that capital and, at the 
same time, generate construction and 
services revenues.
Construction division strategy
Kier’s UK building business is one of  
the most diverse operations in the UK.  
It operates throughout the country and 
has access to a significant number of 
public and private sector frameworks. 
However, we still secure much of our 
work through tender processes, where 
customers often seek best value rather 
than lowest price. As a result, we are 
able to secure good quality work. 
Our broad skills allow us to adapt our 
offering across the UK to respond to 
different opportunities, which has been 
particularly important in the current 
economic climate.
As markets begin to improve, we are 
well placed to focus strategically on 
growth areas – for example, Living*, 
health and education. In all those areas, 
we have secured good framework 
positions which will deliver revenue  
in the coming years. As private 
developers become more confident,  
we are experiencing more commercial 
opportunities and our strong balance 
sheet positions us well as a partner  
of choice for many of them. 
We continue to strengthen our UK 
infrastructure business so that it can 
execute some of the largest civil 
engineering schemes in the country, 
where barriers to entry are higher. We 
have been successful in winning and 
executing a significant part of the 
Crossrail project and, more recently,  
we were awarded the £450m Mersey 
Gateway Bridge, further demonstrating 
the progress made in our infrastructure 
business, in which annual revenues are 
now approaching £300m.
We have had a significant presence in 
the power station construction market 
for a number of years and maintained  
a nuclear capability through our work at 
Sellafield, Aldermaston and Devonport 
dockyard. As a result, we are one of a 
small number of contractors capable of 
operating in this sector and have recently 
secured work for Urenco and EDF. We 
are working closely with the new nuclear 
generation companies for whom work is 
likely to start in the near term.
Our overseas business has also 
expanded and strengthened over recent 
years and we are looking to consolidate 
that growth. We are based in three 
regions – Hong Kong, the Middle East 
and the Caribbean - and expect each 
region to deliver approximately £50m  
of annual revenue. We focus on regions 
where we see a long-term, stable 
workload, recognising the risks involved 
in overseas operations. Risk 
management is a primary consideration 
in assessing overseas projects.
Services division strategy
The significant expansion of our 
Services business has been another key 
element of our strategy. The acquisition 
of May Gurney on 8 July 2013 has not 
only doubled the size of our Services 
offering, but also adds additional, 
significant businesses to the Group, 
allowing us to offer more services  
to more customers. The scale of the 
business will also create opportunities 
for greater efficiency. 
A key factor in the acquisition of  
May Gurney was the ability to provide 
cost-effective solutions and additional 
services across a wider customer base. 
Since acquiring the business, we have 
also identified opportunities to create 
revenue synergies for the Group.
A key element of our strategy is  
to be both diverse and market-leading  
in our chosen businesses: Construction, 
Services and Property.

Property division strategy
Our Property business benefits from 
being part of the Group in two principal 
ways. Firstly, the cash generated by our 
Construction and Services businesses 
can be reinvested in Property. Secondly, 
the Group’s ability to finance, build, 
operate and maintain assets has been  
a key differentiator in winning a number 
of development projects.
The Property division’s strategy has 
been to gain access to long-term 
development portfolios, particularly 
through joint ventures with the public  
and regulated sectors. By utilising the 
Group’s strong balance sheet and broad 
skill sets, sites are secured and asset 
values are improved through planning 
and development expertise. Having 
identified end-users, long-term leases 
are typically negotiated before we 
provide capital and build an asset. We 
set a target return on capital of 15% per 
annum which is significantly more than 
our average cost of capital. The division 
often acts as the catalyst for 
opportunities in other parts of  
the Group and approximately 10%  
of the Construction division’s annual 
revenues are derived from our property 
developments.
Our PFI activities will continue to be  
a feature of the business and enable  
the Group to demonstrate the full breadth 
of its capability - from financing to 
construction and long-term maintenance. 
Our strategy is to sell mature assets 
whilst securing, building and maintaining 
new assets. In the past year, we have 
sold four assets and won three new 
larger schemes, having increased the 
valuation of the portfolio. New PFI 
schemes are being made available 
through the Government’s PF2 
programme and schemes such as the 
Aberdeen Western Peripheral route. 
With the residential housing market 
becoming more positive, assisted by 
greater mortgage availability, increasing 
Government incentives to private buyers 
and investment in affordable housing 
grants, both our private and affordable 
homes businesses are well placed for 
growth in the next few years.
Our strategy is to focus on a region 
around our Tempsford Hall 
headquarters, encompassing 
Bedfordshire and Cambridgeshire, and 
an area in the Central Belt in Scotland, 
whilst reducing our land holdings 
elsewhere. Our affordable homes 
business is expected to expand its area 
of operation from the Midlands, having 
recently secured a position on the HCA’s 
Development Partner Panel throughout 
the UK.

General business improvement
We are focusing on expanding  
our capabilities in a controlled  
and sustainable way. We have begun  
a process of making the business more 
efficient and better equipped for future 
growth. This has involved a significant 
restructuring of the management 
structures throughout the Group.
As part of this process, we have  
made significant investment in IT  
and management systems across  
all of our back-office functions and 
businesses. 
This programme, together with the 
integration of May Gurney into our 
Services division, is already achieving 
significant cost savings, while allowing 
us to deliver services to our customers 
in an increasingly efficient manner.

Overview
Chairman’s
statement
“ The Group 
delivered a  
resilient cash 
performance, 
despite the 
challenging  
working capital 
environment”
I am pleased to report a solid set of 
results for Kier Group plc (Kier) for the 
year ended 30 June 2013. Underlying 
profit before tax* of £63.4m (2012: 
£70.0m) and earnings per share* of 
136.2p (2012: 156.8p) were in line 
with our expectations. 
The Group delivered a resilient cash 
performance, despite the challenging 
working capital environment. Average 
Group month-end net debt was £4m 
(2012: average month-end net cash of 
£95m) as a result of the timing of our 
property transactions some of which 
completed in the last quarter of the 
financial year and after investment 
during the year of £77m, mainly in our 
Property and Construction businesses. 
This produced a Group net cash 
position at 30 June 2013 of £60m 
(2012: £129m).
Phil White
Chairman
Taking into account the performance 
of the Group, its strengthened capital 
structure and continuing the Group’s 
progressive dividend policy, the Board 
proposes to increase the total dividend 
for the year by 3% to 68p (2012: 66p), 
which is well covered by underlying 
earnings per share and reflects the 
Board’s confidence in the business.  
The final dividend of 46.5p will be paid 
on 27 November 2013 to shareholders 
on the register at close of business on 
20 September 2013. There will be a 
scrip dividend alternative.
*  Underlying operating profits and margins, pre-tax profits and EPS are stated before amortisation of

£17.0m (2012: £3.6m). Annual Report and Accounts 2013 —— 05   
Board changes
During the year, the Board undertook a 
review of the management structure of 
the Group, following which a decision 
was taken to introduce the role of chief 
operating officer (COO) to strengthen 
and integrate Kier’s operating 
processes across the enlarged Group 
and ensure that they are implemented 
in a cohesive and consistent way. 
Steve Bowcott was appointed to 
this role and is responsible for 
the operational efficiency of both 
the Construction and the Services 
divisions. In addition to his current 
responsibilities, Haydn Mursell, the 
Group finance director, has assumed 
operational responsibility for the 
Property division. As a result of these 
changes Ian Lawson retired as a 
director from the Board in June. 
I am confident that the introduction 
of the COO role, together with clearly 
defined roles and responsibilities for 
each of the executive management 
team, will enable the business to 
continue to deliver a strong trading 
performance.
Outlook 
We have secured a number of 
significant contract wins across all 
of our businesses which means that 
we have begun the 2014 financial 
year in a good position, with all of the 
Construction division’s targeted revenue 
and 95% of the Services division’s 
targeted revenue currently secured  
and probable. 
Having completed the acquisition of 
May Gurney in July, our combined order 
book now stands at £5.9bn across 
those divisions and stretches well 
beyond 2020. In addition, the Property 
division has a pipeline of £1.5bn and 
will be a key contributor to the Group 
results in the coming years.
The comprehensive review of our 
business that we started earlier in 
the year is substantially complete 
and our attention remains focused 
on the successful integration of May 
Gurney. This comes at a time when the 
macroeconomic outlook is beginning to 
improve in all our markets, positioning 
the Group for growth.
The role of our committees
Board of Directors
The Board is responsible to shareholders for the success of the Company. The Board 
develops the Group’s strategy, monitors and reviews its business performance and 
controls risk. The Board has put in place reporting processes and other controls which 
are designed to ensure that it is provided with relevant information on a timely basis, 
which set authorisation limits and which reserve certain significant matters for the Board 
or its committees.
Risk Management and Audit Committee
Chair Richard Bailey
The Risk Management and Audit Committee 
comprises the non-executive directors. 
Richard Bailey, a chartered accountant with 
recent and relevant financial experience, 
is the chairman of the committee. The 
committee is responsible for monitoring and 
reviewing the Group’s internal audit function. 
The director responsible for internal audit 
meets the chairman of the committee 
to discuss the function and the Group’s 
internal controls. The committee is also 
responsible for monitoring and reviewing the 
performance, independence and objectivity 
of KPMG, the external auditor.
Nomination Committee
Chair Amanda Mellor
The Nomination Committee comprises  
the Group’s non-executive directors. 
Amanda Mellor is the chair of the 
committee. The committee is responsible 
for monitoring the composition and balance 
of the Board, making recommendations to 
the Board on new Board appointments and 
succession planning.
Remuneration Committee
Chair Chris Geoghegan
The Remuneration Committee comprises 
the non-executive directors. Chris 
Geoghegan is the chairman of the 
committee. The committee makes 
recommendations to the Board on the 
Company’s framework of executive 
remuneration and determines, on its 
behalf, specific remuneration packages 
for each of the executive directors. 
In doing so, it takes the advice of 
independent external consultants.
Safety, Health and Environment 
Committee (SHE Committee)
Chair Nick Winser
The SHE Committee comprises Nick 
Winser and Amanda Mellor, although the 
executive directors of the Group and the 
health and safety director are invited, 
and expected, to attend meetings, unless 
they are notified to the contrary. The 
committee is responsible for assisting 
the Board with respect to reviewing (i) the 
Group’s strategy with respect to safety, 
health and environmental (SHE) matters, 
(ii) the Group’s exposure to SHE risks and 
(iii) Group-wide SHE initiatives, policies 
and procedures and monitoring the 
Group’s performance against SHE targets.

On 8 July 2013, Kier acquired May Gurney, 
welcoming another 6,000 employees to the 
Kier family.
Overview Financial statements Governance Financial review Corporate responsibility Operational review 08 —— Kier Group plc 
Overview 
Kier has delivered a solid set of results 
for the year ended 30 June 2013, 
with underlying profit before tax* and 
earnings per share* in line with our 
expectations. This has been supported 
by a resilient cash performance, with 
a year-end net cash balance of £60m 
(2012: £129m) after significant 
investment across the Group. This has 
been achieved in a very competitive 
trading environment and is testament to 
our effective project selection and risk 
management processes. 
We have also had a number of 
significant project wins, enabling us to 
maintain strong order books. These 
include the Mersey Gateway Bridge, 
Broadmoor Hospital redevelopment, 
securing the redevelopment rights 
to the Swan Hunter shipyards on 
Tyneside and over £200m of housing 
maintenance awards.
During the year, we strengthened 
our capital structure, securing 
£92m of new funding via US private 
placements (USPP) with seven and 
ten-year durations and a loan under 
the Government’s Funding for Lending 
Scheme, over four years. These 
replaced the previous £30m USPP, 
which expired in February, and are in 
addition to the renegotiations of our 
revolving credit facilities in 2012, which 
run to September 2016.
The acquisition of May Gurney is a key 
milestone in the ongoing development 
and growth of the Group. We now have 
a combined order book of almost £6bn 
across our Construction and Services 
divisions, providing us with a strong 
platform for 2014 and beyond.

*  Underlying operating profits and margins, pre-tax profits and EPS are stated before amortisation of 
intangible assets relating to contract rights of £3.4m (2012: £3.4m) and exceptional items totalling 
£17.0m (2012: £3.6m). Annual Report and Accounts 2013 —— 09   
Revenue for the year at £1,983m was 
slightly lower than last year (2012: 
£2,069m), primarily because of the 
reduction in our Construction revenues. 
Poor weather in the first quarter of this 
calendar year caused delays, pushing 
revenues into the 2014 financial year. 
As predicted, we have also seen a 
change in the mix of activities, with 
more infrastructure and overseas work.
The Group’s operating profit* was 
£69.7m (2012: £74.4m), in line with 
our expectations and comprised 
operating margins* of 2.3% in 
Construction, 4.4% in Services and 
a sustained contribution (£20.5m) 
from Property as we continue with 
our investment strategy. The strength 
of the underlying divisional operating 
margins reflects the quality of the work 
we completed during the year.
Exceptional items before tax amounted 
to a charge of £17.0m for the year 
(2012: charge of £3.6m), as follows:
>  £12.0m relating to the 
comprehensive restructuring 
programme mainly in the 
Construction division, which is 
substantially complete. These 
included costs related to the closure 
of the scaffolding, joinery and 
temporary electrical businesses, 
office closures and associated staff 
reductions;
>  £3.2m relating to the disposal of 
the tower crane business, which 
comprised the loss on disposal of 
some of the fixed assets together 
with transaction and redundancy 
costs; and
>  £1.8m of acquisition and integration 
costs relating to the May Gurney 
transaction.
The cash outflow during the year in 
respect of the above was approximately 
£11.0m.
Profit before tax* for the year of 
£63.4m (2012: £70.0m) and earnings 
per share of 136.2p (2012: 156.8p) 
were both in line with our expectations.

Operational review
Chief 
executive’s 
review
Continued
The management of working capital 
remains very important to us. We 
continue to operate in a challenging 
payment environment, where the 
introduction of project bank accounts 
and specific payment terms, particularly 
across public sector contracts and 
framework arrangements, place 
greater pressure on the working 
capital position of the Group. This is 
coupled with the changing nature of our 
construction contracts to a target cost, 
reimbursable type, as we continue to 
grow our infrastructure and overseas 
businesses. 
It is therefore pleasing that the Group 
achieved an average month-end net 
debt balance of £4m (2012: average 
month-end net cash of £95m) after 
investment of approximately £77m 
during the year and the completion of  
a number of our property transactions 
in the last quarter of the financial year. 
May Gurney 
The acquisition of May Gurney has 
created a combined support services 
business with revenues in excess of 
£1bn. The enlarged Group is now more 
evenly balanced with an increased 
proportion of profits being derived from 
the Services division, which has an 
order book stretching over ten years. 
The strategic rationale for the 
acquisition was to enable us to  
deliver more services to more 
customers over a wider geography. 
Our capability now extends to 
highways maintenance where we 
maintain approximately 35,000km of 
roads and 500,000 street lights and 
signs. Our environmental portfolio 
has substantially increased and we 
now provide services to over three 
million households. In utility services, 
we now have a presence in the 
telecommunications sector and an 
increased operational capability in 
many of the water authority regions on 
AMP5 schemes, which will position us 
well for the forthcoming AMP6 tenders 
in 2014.
Since the acquisition, we have not lost 
any contracts and our combined set of 
capabilities has enabled us to bid on a 
range of new projects covering water, 
rail and highways with a total value in 
excess of £500m. 
Restructuring
In order to improve the efficiency of the 
Group, we have undertaken a significant 
restructuring programme during the 
year, closing some non-core operations 
and adjusting the scale of our regional 
building operations to better suit 
anticipated demand. 
The programme is designed to ensure 
that we operate as efficiently as 
possible and maintain our operating 
margins at good levels. We will 
continue to invest appropriately in our 
IT infrastructure, which will help us to 
deliver further operational efficiencies. 
The cost of this programme, reported 
as an exceptional charge, was £12.0m.
Outlook
With our entire forecast Construction 
revenue and 95% of our Services 
revenue secure and probable for 2014, 
we are in a strong position to achieve 
organic growth, which coupled with the 
strength of the forward bidding pipeline 
gives us comfort that this trend is likely 
to continue. The £1.5bn pipeline in our 
Property division has grown significantly 
over the last three years and there are 
many opportunities, which will provide 
good visibility of future earnings. We 
have the cash resources to continue to 
invest in non-speculative schemes that 
will generate our targeted 15% return 
on capital.
Following the acquisition of May Gurney 
we have received very strong customer 
support for the combination and we 
are already seeing the benefits of the 
greater breadth of services we can offer 
new and existing customers across  
the country. 
The bidding for AMP6, across the water 
sector, will commence later this year 
and we are well placed to capitalise on 
the combined capabilities of the two 
businesses, while our combined rail 
offering will be of great benefit as we 
tender for a range of new framework 
agreements with Network Rail. Similarly, 
the scale of services we can deliver to 
local authorities providing innovative 
and cost effective solutions will be well 
received at a time when they are still 
looking to make operational savings. Annual Report and Accounts 2013 —— 11

Safety, Health and Environment (SHE)
Through visible leadership, worker 
engagement and effective risk 
management, our goal remains the 
elimination of workplace injuries, better 
protection to our environment and an 
increase in our people’s awareness 
of occupational health and well-being. 
Our Accident Incident Rate (AIR) of 333 
remains well below the Health & Safety 
Executive’s benchmark figure of 589. 
Our Positive Safety Leadership (PSL) 
programme has delivered over 50,000 
conversations recognising both positive 
and challenging aspects of SHE 
performance. These are a powerful 
means of engaging with our staff and 
developing a positive safety leadership 
culture throughout the Group. Over 60% 
of the delegates attending the Safe 
and Unsafe Acts (SUSA) workshops 
came from our supply chain, indicating 
the importance of collaborative 
working in delivering top-quartile SHE 
performance. 
Our occupational health department 
supports the business in its aim to 
raise the awareness of well-being and 
the elimination of workplace injuries 
and incidents. Several health focus 
events were held throughout the 
country which were supported equally 
well by both Kier employees and our 
supply chain. 
During the year, Kier received 22 
RoSPA awards, 13 BSC awards, 44 
Considerate Constructors Scheme 
national awards, six Green Apple 
awards, winner of the National 
Recycling award and the National 
House Building Council (NHBC) Health

consecutive year. We also achieved 
95% (Platinum Big Tick status) in our 
2013 Business in the Community 
(BITC) Corporate Responsibility Index 
(2012: 90% Gold status). 
People
The acquisition of May Gurney involved 
a team of people from both businesses 
who have worked tirelessly to make  
the integration as smooth as possible 
with the least disruption to our 
respective customers. 
We have welcomed our new colleagues 
to Kier with particular focus on health 
and safety, personnel, training and 
development to reinforce our objective 
of providing a seamless expansion 
of our services with a motivated 
and quality-driven management and 
workforce.
It is through the effort and commitment 
of our staff, now totalling approximately 
16,000 people, that we remain a strong 
business and can continue to report 
such a solid set of results in the current 
economic environment.
On behalf of the Board, I would like to 
express my gratitude to everyone who 
makes all of this possible.

skilled in the construction of the full 
range of building projects, together 
with power, waste and infrastructure 
facilities, transport, water and mining 
projects. 
Construction business review
Revenue in Construction was 5% lower 
than last year, at £1,308m (2012: 
£1,384m), as a result of poor weather 
in the first quarter of this calendar year 
causing delays and pushing revenues 
into the 2014 financial year. We have 
also experienced a change in the mix 
of activities within the division. UK 
building revenue has decreased to 
approximately £1bn, as we maintain 
our focus on the quality of work we 
pursue. However, this reduction has 
been partially mitigated by growth in UK 
infrastructure and overseas revenues.
As a result of the increasing proportion 
of UK infrastructure and overseas 
operations, a selective approach to new 
work and our prudent profit recognition 
policy, the operating margin*, at 2.3% 
(2012: 2.5%) represented a strong 
performance in today’s markets, 
delivering £30.4m (2012: £35.2m)  
of operating profit*.
Cash, an area of key focus in this 
division, reduced to £320m (2012: 
£361m) after a £14m investment in 
our mining operations, a £6m cash 
effect of the restructuring programme, 
combined with a changing mix of 
activities with an increasing number 
of infrastructure projects typically of 
a target cost, reimbursable nature. 
However, the working capital trends 
that affected the building operations in 
the first six months of the financial year 
did not significantly affect the second 
half of the year. We will maintain 
strong management of working capital, 
particularly across public sector 
contracts and framework arrangements, 
where more stringent supply chain 
payment terms are being introduced.
We continue to have good visibility 
of high quality opportunities, with 
approximately 60% of contract awards 
during the year arising from numerous 
frameworks, together with a number of 
negotiated opportunities with clients 
with which we have long-term and 
well-established relationships. These 
awards, together with ‘probable awards’ 
Operational review
Construction
(comprising contracts on which we are 
in one-to-one negotiations), totalled 
£1.3bn, and have maintained the 
secured and probable order book at 
£2.2bn (2012: £2.2bn). This secures 
all of our targeted revenue for the 2014 
financial year.
Approximately 49% of our awards 
were for public sector projects (2012: 
50%) and we continue to predict that 
the balance of public sector to private 
sector work will remain at these levels.
Of the public sector awards, the 
education sector continues to be the 
largest source of work, representing 
28% of awards (2012: 31%). Despite 
the decline in education spending, the 
Contractors’ Framework continues to 
provide opportunities and during the 
year has resulted in more than £100m 
of contract awards. A replacement 
framework is currently being tendered 
with award notification expected in 
October 2013, which could be worth  
up to £4bn over four years.

areas, we have secured good framework positions 
which will deliver revenue in the coming years.
We continue to strengthen our UK infrastructure 
business so that it can execute some of the 
largest civil engineering schemes in the country, 
where barriers to entry are higher.

We were also appointed to the South 
West Hub in Scotland, where there is 
a pipeline of £600m of work over 10 
years for 17 councils and other public 
bodies, and have recently become 
preferred bidder on £60m of design & 
build and Facilities Management (FM) 
schools work under the scheme.
The healthcare sector represented 15% 
of our contract awards (2012: 10%) and 
the six-year ProCure21+ Framework, 
which commenced in 2010, generated 
over £150m of awards in the year and 
£400m to date, with a further pipeline 
identified in excess of £300m. In June 
2013, we were selected as one of 
five delivery partners for Frameworks 
Scotland 2 for healthcare projects over 
£1m, with a forecast total of £660m 
over six years, and in the same month 
we were appointed as contractor for the 
£115m redevelopment of Broadmoor 
Hospital.
In the private sector, the strategic 
relationship we have developed with 
the Argent Group at the King’s Cross 
Central Development continues to be 
a success, providing nearly £90m of 
projects at preferred bidder stage, 
including a £65m residential-led 
mixed-use development, an £18m 
supermarket project and a £5m pavilion 
scheme. This is in addition to the 
£110m of work currently underway  
on the development.
Our Living business continues to be

of a three-way joint venture, Merseylink, 
with FCC and Samsung, to deliver the 
capital works on the circa £450m 
Mersey Gateway scheme, which 
includes construction of a new six-

In the rail sector, we continue to 
progress well on Crossrail projects with 
over £800m of work underway in joint 
venture on the C300/410 Western 
Tunnels and the Farringdon and 
Liverpool Street stations. We have also 
completed work on the roof at King’s 
Cross station in London and the station 
regeneration at Epsom.
At the Greenburn surface coal mine, we 
secured planning for a further extension 
to the mining area, adding 750,000t of 
coal to the consented reserves. Work 
has already commenced in the new 
area, Wellhill, which will be mined over 
the next three years in conjunction with 
our existing Braehead site. 
Overseas, we continue to experience 
growth in our chosen markets. In 
the Caribbean, we have enjoyed 
another successful year with awards 
in Jamaica and Haiti, including a new 
£22m Marriott Hotel in Port-au-Prince. 
The pipeline of regional opportunities 
remains strong and includes a number 
of opportunities in Trinidad and the 
Eastern Caribbean. Similar success 
has been enjoyed in the Middle East, 
where we have secured a number of 
projects in Abu Dhabi, Dubai and Saudi 
Arabia, and we are in preferred bidder 
position for a negotiated £32m hotel 
in the region. In Hong Kong, our major 
joint venture projects for the Mass 
Transit Railway Corporation (MTRC) are 
progressing well and we are targeting 
a number of further opportunities in 
both the infrastructure and building 
sectors over the next 12 months. Our 
overseas business is on target to 
achieve revenues of £150m in 2014, 
as predicted.
Construction markets and outlook
The Construction business has 
maintained a strong position across 
its key markets. However, the trading 
environment is such that margins 
and working capital continue to 
be challenging. The restructuring 
programme will ensure we operate as 
efficiently as possible and maintain 
operating margins at approximately 2%.
We will continue with the strategy of 
focusing on the selection of high quality 
opportunities which best complement 
our skill sets and technical expertise. 
Our regional building coverage across 
the UK remains important; we will 
also continue to invest in our UK 
infrastructure activities and pursue 
growth in our key overseas regions. The 
recent acquisition of May Gurney also 
broadens our access to the rail market, 
where our combined capabilities 
will help us deliver larger and more 
integrated projects in this sector.
This robust approach will ensure our 
future strong performance, which 
together with our mix of activities 
across building and infrastructure, 
positions the business well for  
the future.

Services
In our reporting in this year, we cover 
the three Services businesses that 
contributed to the 2013 results – 
housing maintenance, which provides 
reactive and planned maintenance 
largely to local authorities and housing 
associations; environmental, offering 
services for waste collection, the 
operation of a major recycling facility 
and grounds maintenance; and facilities 
management (FM). 
The enlarged Services division, since 
the acquisition of May Gurney, now 
comprises seven businesses: housing 
maintenance, environmental, FM, 
highways maintenance, utilities services 
(mainly water and telecommunications), 
fleet and passenger services and 
waterways services. 
Services business review
Revenue in all three businesses, 
housing maintenance, environmental 
and FM, was at similar levels to last 
year, at £437m (2012: £445m). This 
result reflects our success in renewing 
existing contracts and securing new 
business, despite the continued budget 
constraints faced by many of our public 
sector customers. 
The operating margin* delivered was 
4.4% (2012: 4.5%) and produced an 
operating profit* of £19.3m (2012: 
£20.1m). The margin is in line with 
our expectations and includes a higher 
level of bidding and mobilisation costs 
following our success in securing major 
schemes, such as Circle Housing Group 
and East Sussex.
Cash balances increased to £30m 
(2012: £19m) after investment in 
environmental vehicles, the cash effect 
of the exceptional items and included 
the £15m proceeds from the disposal 
of the majority of the plant business in 
August 2012. In August 2013, the sale 
of our tower cranes business for £5m 
also completed. Both transactions are 
in line with our strategy of withdrawing 
from non-core operations.
The order book at 30 June 2013 of 
£2.0bn (2012: £2.1bn) provided a 
good forward visibility of work, having 
secured over £400m of new contracts. 
This secured 95% of our targeted 
revenue for the 2014 financial year. The 
order book does not include contract 
extensions, which if our customers 
exercised in total, would add a further 
£800m.
Housing maintenance business 
revenues remained stable at £280m 
for 2013 (2012: £280m). This was a 
good result given the ongoing budget 
constraints, particularly in the area of 
discretionary spend by existing clients 
and the slower release of new work 
during the year. We continue to manage 
over 300,000 homes across the UK, 
representing 5% of the UK social 
housing market.
During the year, we were awarded 
planned housing improvement contracts 
as well as repair and maintenance

The significant expansion of our Services 
business has been another key element  
of our strategy. The acquisition of May Gurney  
on 8 July 2013 has not only doubled the size  
of our Services offering, but also adds additional, 
significant businesses to the Group, allowing 
us to offer more services to more customers. 
The scale of the business will also create 
opportunities for greater efficiency. 
A key factor in the acquisition of May Gurney 
was the ability to provide cost effective solutions 
and additional services across a wider customer 
base. Since acquiring the business, we have 
also identified opportunities to create revenue 
synergies for the Group.

growing presence in the Welsh market, 
including a four-year contract with 
Cardiff Council (£10m) and a five- 
plus two-year contract for the Welsh

The business also closed two private 
finance deals, providing an integrated 
PFI solution for London Fire Brigade 
and Staffordshire Fire and Rescue with 
a combined FM value of £34m, over 
25 years. In addition, contract wins 
with Hampshire and Surrey County 
Councils and the growth in the Scape 
Framework generated revenues of 
£40m. Elsewhere the business has 
further grown its portfolio of private 
sector customers including contracts 
with the RAC and DTZ estates. 
Services markets and outlook
The Services division’s performance 
remains robust, with a stable £2.0bn 
order book giving good forward visibility 
of workload, coupled with potential 
extensions of £800m and a steady 
pipeline of further opportunities.  
We entered the 2014 financial year  
with 95% of our expected revenues 
secure and probable, which will 
maintain operating margins at around 
current levels.
In our housing maintenance business, 
we have good forward visibility of the 
bidding pipeline through to 2018, which 
is in excess of £3bn on responsive, 
planned and refurbishment activity 
across the social housing sector, 
with both local authority and Housing 
Association Registered Providers. The 
social housing repair, maintenance 
and refurbishment sector remains 
competitive, as both local authority 
and Housing Association Registered 
Providers seek ongoing efficiencies in 
response to further central government 
budget reductions announced in the 
2013 Comprehensive Spending Review. 
In the private sector, our diverse set 
of capabilities, covering soft FM, 
hard FM and building management, 
will provide further opportunities as 
customers examine their cost base and 
seek savings by outsourcing non-core 
activities.
In Services, our strategy remains to 
achieve scale and diversification and to 
drive operating efficiencies and greater 
penetration in our core markets. The 
May Gurney acquisition has delivered a 
significant element of the strategy and 
provides a broader platform for growth. 
Over the medium term, we will continue 
to refine our strategy to ensure we 
are well placed to enter new markets, 
capitalise on emerging markets and 
drive for growth in our existing markets, 
particularly through building stronger 
relationships with customers, delivering 
excellent service and innovation.
Overview Financial statements Governance Financial review Corporate responsibility Operational review 22 —— Kier Group plc 
The Property division encompasses 
our property development, structured 
project finance and private and 
affordable homes businesses and has 
a pipeline in excess of £1.5bn across 
our development and mixed-tenure 
housing activities. 
Property business review
Revenue for the year to 30 June 2013 
of £238m (2012: £241m) was broadly 
in line with last year. Operating profit 
was £20.5m (2012: £22.0m) and 
resulted from the ongoing progress 
of our combined £1.5bn property 
development and affordable housing 
pipeline and the level of private housing 
sales achieved.
Within the property development 
business, we completed a number 
of successful deals in the year and 
achieved a 15% pre-tax return on 
capital. In June 2013, we sold a £46m 
retail and warehouse scheme at 
Sydenham to Kier Sydenham LP, 50% 
of which is owned by Kier, with the 
remaining 50% owned by the trustees 
of the Kier Group Pension Scheme. 
The Trade City brand for industrial 
development continues to perform 
well, with new schemes at Trade City 
International Park in Hayes (60,000sq 
ft) and at Trade City Cowley Mill Road, 
Uxbridge (120,000sq ft). 
In July 2013, North Tyneside Council 
named Kier Property as its development 
partner to bring forward the £100m 
regeneration of the former Swan Hunter 
shipyard. We will deliver a master plan 
to transform the 34-acre site, secure 
occupiers for the high-tech industrial 
and office complex and build bespoke 
units over the next three years for 
individual occupiers.
Solum Regeneration, the joint venture 
with Network Rail, has in excess of 
£500m of mixed-use schemes in 
its portfolio. We have completed the 
scheme at Epsom station, are nearing 
completion at Walthamstow and 
Christchurch and have planning consent 
at Twickenham and Haywards Heath. 
In June 2013 we reached financial close 
on the £240m Watford Health Campus 
project. The project will regenerate land 
around the Watford General Hospital, 
delivering 375,000sq ft of mixed-use 
development to the area including up  
to 650 new homes.
We continued with our strategy to sell 
mature PFI investments and disposed 
of equity investments in four projects: 
Bournemouth Library, Greenwich 
Neighbourhood Resource Centres, 
Ipswich Hospital and Gloucestershire 
Fire Stations. The total consideration 
was approximately £13m, representing 
a valuation discount rate on future cash 
flows of approximately 7%.

Property division strategy (by profit)
The Property division’s strategy has been to gain 
access to long-term development portfolios, 
particularly through joint ventures with the public 
and regulated sectors.
By utilising the Group’s strong balance sheet  
and broad skill sets, sites are secured and  
asset values are improved through planning  
and development expertise. Having identified 
end-users, long-term leases are typically negotiated 
before we provide capital and build an asset.
Our PFI activities will continue to be a feature 
of the business and truly enable the Group to 
demonstrate the full breadth of its capability 
- from financing to construction and long-term 
maintenance. Our affordable homes business  
is expected to expand, having recently secured  
a position on the HCA’s Development Partner 
Panel throughout the UK.

two plants in operation at the time of 
the acquisition, we are currently building 
three plants, two in Wales and one in 
Hertfordshire. We are also preferred 
bidder on a further local authority plant 
in Wales and close to a start on site for 
a plant at Merevale, Warwickshire. 
The private homes business made 
good progress during the year, with 
demand in the residential housing 
market remaining positive, assisted by 
Government incentives and an easing in 
mortgage availability. Sales rates and 
completions exceeded expectations at 
0.7 sales/week/active site, delivering 
556 completions during the year. At 
30 June 2013, the closing land bank 
held 4,005 plots (2012: 4,180), having 
acquired five sites (474 units) and 
replanned other existing land holdings 
to improve viability.
The affordable housing market is 
also a fast moving environment. Our 
mixed-tenure regeneration business 
model, coupled with access to public 
sector land through a position on the 
Homes and Communities Agency’s 
Development Partner Panel framework, 
has allowed us to develop opportunities 
in this sector and given us a platform to 
maximise our affordable housing grant 
allocation. Since July 2012, we have 
been successful in securing £230m 
of mixed-tenure housing development 
schemes, taking our forward order 
book to £400m, which equates to 
approximately 2,600 new homes. 
Significant new schemes include 700 
new homes at Manor and Kingsway 
Derby, 200 new homes at Greets Green 
in the West Midlands and 120 new 
homes in the third phase of a Bolsover 
regeneration programme in Derbyshire.
Property markets and outlook
The Property division continues to 
bring together skills and expertise from 
across the Group to deliver greater 
value from our schemes and to our 
customers. 
There has been some improvement in 
market sentiment and bidding activity, 
which has resulted in increased 
competition, particularly from smaller 
companies with financial backing. 
However, this will present the business 
with opportunities to differentiate by 
utilising the Group’s strong covenant 
and balance sheet.
In property development, we maintain a 
focus on predominantly non-speculative 
opportunities in well-located and 
marketable areas. Any such schemes 
will have significant potential for 
occupier-led, pre-let or forward sale 
solutions, while targeting a 15% return 
on capital. Similarly, we continue to 
pursue innovative funding routes to 
support the growth in the development 
pipeline and make the best use of the 
Group’s cash reserves. 
In the housing businesses, we will 
continue with a strategy of maintaining 
a private 600-unit housing business 
and will pursue growth in our mixed-
tenure housing business through 
well-established relationships with local 
authorities and housing associations.
The Property division now has a pipeline 
of schemes valued at more than 
£1.5bn across both the development 
and mixed-tenure housing businesses. 
This creates a robust platform, which 
will underpin sustainable levels of profit 
over the next few years, while providing 
more than £100m of opportunities 
annually for the Construction division.

May Gurney in July 2013 has seen this 
figure grow to 16,000. We are currently 
undergoing an integration process to

its strands, has a large and important 
part to play in this exercise.
With our newly reinforced Kier team, 
we have greater potential than ever 
before to make a really positive 
difference for the benefit of thousands 
of people within our areas of operation

essence of our business and we are 
very much aware that it is their attitude 
and behaviours that determine our

average, our carbon emissions have 
reduced, we’ve achieved our half waste 
to landfill target and our training and 
development programme has been 
awarded Training Initiative of the Year 
for its Developing Leaders scheme. 
Our positive community impact has 
been stepped up yet again with over 
44 Considerate Constructors Scheme 
National awards – significantly more 
than any other company in our sector.
During the year Kier employees have 
been busy raising funds for The Kier 
Foundation, an independent, registered 
charity established by Kier in 2011. To 
date, the total funds raised on behalf of 
Kier Group’s corporate charity partner, 
Barnardo’s, stands at over £190,000. 
Alongside this, our people have been 
supporting many other charities of 
their choice supported by Kier match 
funding. Once again, they have shown 
real enthusiasm by taking part in all 
manner of activities to raise funds for 
good causes and many have become 
involved in community projects in their 
spare time. Barnardo’s are delighted 
with our fundraising performance, 
and so am I. I am very proud of the 
commitment shown by Kier employees 
in making a difference to other people’s 
lives and long may it continue.
Kier remains in good shape – better 
than many in our sector – and it is 
important that we remain poised to 
benefit from emerging opportunities 
and market changes. Some things 
we have little control over and while 
we have no option but to await signs 
of an economic recovery, we can 
take positive action in terms of our 
contribution to society. This helps to 
make a real difference to the way we 
are perceived as a business, our status 
as an employer and as a partner in the 
local community.  Annual Report and Accounts 2013 —— 29   
A fully integrated approach CR Steering Committee
We recognise that a robust approach 
to all aspects of CR plays an important 
role in building a good reputation. 
Everything we say, everything we do and 
what others say about us influences 
our stakeholder groups. Our need to be 
recognised as a corporately responsible 
business must be maintained as part 
of our vision to be the most highly 
respected company in the industry.
Managing responsibility
Senior management with clearly defined 
roles are responsible and accountable 
to the Kier Board for ensuring that all 
aspects of our corporate responsibility, 
our brand, business risks, governance, 
ethics and finances are managed 
responsibly.
Delivering quality
As part of our bid to continuously 
improve we canvass our clients 
regularly and take action whenever 
appropriate to improve what we do 
and how we do it. Our aim is to exceed 
client expectations across our full range 
of services.
Stakeholder relationships
We are proactive in engaging with 
our shareholders to promote an 
understanding of how we operate.  
(See ‘relations with shareholders’ 
on page 57). We engage with our 
employees through roadshows and 
biennial surveys* to encourage 
feedback; our customers through 
satisfaction surveys and our 
communities through the Considerate 
Constructors Scheme, The Kier 
Foundation, BITC and numerous 
charities. The above is covered in 
more detail within our full Corporate 
Responsibility Report which is 
downloadable from www.kier.co.uk/
ar2013/crr. We do not make any 
political donations (see directors’  
report on page 48).
During the year ended 30 June 2013 
directors were eligible to receive a 
bonus, a proportion of which was 
payable if corporate responsibility and 
health & safety performance targets, 
which are considered to be key non-
financial measures for the Group, were 
achieved. (See Directors’ remuneration 
report on page 59).
The CR Steering Committee reports 
quarterly to the main Board, bringing 
to their attention issues that require 
addressing at the highest level. Such 
issues are listed below.
Chaired by Kier Group chief executive 
Paul Sheffield, the CR Steering 
Committee comprises senior 
representatives from all parts of the 
Group and convenes at least once  
a quarter.
The committee is responsible for 
establishing policies, measuring and 
maintaining the Group’s CR impact 
and ensuring that all aspects of our 
responsibility to society are addressed, 
communicated and acted upon 
throughout all parts of the business.

How we’re 
doing
We are pleased to report that our Accident 
Incident Rate (AIR) v manpower rating remains 
well below the industry average but we know 
that we cannot be complacent and will remain 
focused on reducing our AIR rate still further. 
We’ve achieved our halving waste to 
landfill target in the allotted time; our 
Scope 1 and 2 carbon emissions have 
reduced and our company car emissions 
are down too.
Our Considerate Constructors Scheme 
(CCS) scores have been consistently 
above average and indeed reflect our  
best ever performance to date. We were 
delighted to learn that we had won eight 
Green Apple Awards for a variety of 
environmental best practice initiatives  
by our businesses and two (Gold) awards 
for the Built Environment and Architectural 
Heritage. Our new colleagues at  
May Gurney also won seven Green  
Apple Awards.
Following our participation in the BITC  
CR Index Survey 2013, we are proud of 
our new status as a Platinum Big Tick 
company, having achieved a score of  
95%, up from 90% in 2012 (Gold status).

Assurance
statement
KPMG Audit Plc was engaged by Kier Group plc (‘Kier’) to provide 
limited assurance over selected aspects of the Kier Group plc 
Corporate Responsibility section in its Annual Report and Accounts 
for the year ended 30 June 2013 (‘the Report’).
This independent assurance report is made solely to Kier in 
accordance with the terms of our engagement. Our work has been 
undertaken so that we might state to Kier those matters we have 
been engaged to state within this report and for no other purpose. 
To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume 
responsibility to anyone other than Kier for our work, this report, or 
for the conclusions we have reached.
Responsibilities  
The Directors of Kier Group plc are responsible for preparing the 
Report and the information and statements within it. They are 
responsible for identification of stakeholders and material issues, 
for defining objectives with respect to corporate responsibility 
performance, and for establishing and maintaining appropriate 
performance management and internal control systems from which 
reported information is derived.
Our responsibility is to express our conclusions in relation to the 
scope set out below. 
What was included in the scope of our assurance engagement?
Assurance scope
Reliability of performance data for year ended 30 June 2013 
marked with the symbol * on pages 26 to 32 of the Report. 
Level of assurance
Limited assurance.
Reporting criteria 
Relevant internal reporting guidelines for the selected performance 
data as set out in Kier’s reporting guidelines available at  
www.kier.co.uk/rg.
The extent of evidence-gathering procedures for a limited assurance 
engagement is less than for a reasonable assurance engagement, 
and therefore a lower level of assurance is provided for  
the data.
Inherent limitations 
Non-financial performance information is subject to more inherent 
limitations than financial information, given the characteristics of 
the subject matter and the methods used for determining such 
information. The absence of a significant body of established 
practice on which to draw allows for the selection of different 
but acceptable measurement techniques which can result in 
materially different measurements and can impact comparability. 
The precision of different measurement techniques may also vary. 
Furthermore, the nature and methods used to determine such 
information, as well as the measurement criteria and the precision 
thereof, may change over time. 
It is important to read the selected corporate responsibility 
information contained within the Report in the context of Kier’s 
Reporting Guidelines available on the Kier website www.kier.co.uk/rg. 
In particular, inherent limitations affect the conversion of electricity 
and fuel used to calculate carbon emissions. Conversion of 
electricity and fuel used to calculate carbon emissions is based 
upon, inter alia, information and factors derived by independent 
third parties as explained in Kier’s Reporting Guidelines. Our 
assurance work has not included examination of the derivation 
of those factors and other third-party information. Our assurance 
work has not included challenging the scientific work undertaken by 
independent third parties when calculating these emissions factors. 
Which assurance standard did we use?
We conducted our work in accordance with ISAE 3000
1
, with a 
team of specialists in auditing environmental information and 
with experience in similar engagements. This standard requires 
that we comply with applicable ethical requirements, including 
independence requirements, and plan and perform the engagement 
to obtain limited assurance about whether the data is free from 
material misstatement. 
ISAE 3000 requires the practitioner complies with the requirements 
of Parts A and B of the Code of Ethics for Professional 
Accountants. This is issued by the International Ethics Standards 
Board for Accountants (the IESBA Code) which requires, among 
other requirements, that the members of the assurance team 
(practitioners) as well as the assurance firm (assurance provider) 
be independent of the assurance client, including not being involved 
in writing the Report and plan and perform the engagements to 
obtain limited assurance about whether data is free from material 
misstatement. The Code also includes detailed requirements for 
practitioners regarding integrity, objectivity, professional competence 
and due care, confidentiality and professional behaviour. KPMG  
Audit Plc has systems and processes in place to monitor compliance 
with the Code and to prevent conflicts regarding independence.  
Our independence with the client is reviewed on an annual basis.
What did we do to reach our conclusions?
We planned and performed our work to obtain all the evidence, 
information and explanations that we considered necessary in 
relation to the above scope. Our work was limited to the following 
procedures using a range of evidence-gathering activities which are 
further explained below:
>  Conducting interviews with management and other personnel at 
Kier, to understand the systems and controls in place during the 
year ended 30 June 2013;
>  An evaluation of the design, existence and operation of the 
systems and methods used to collect, process and aggregate 
the selected performance data as well as testing the reliability 
of underlying data at a risk based selection of businesses/sites, 
being those at:
 >  Kier Services – Maintenance
 >  Kier Construction – Kier Infrastructure
 >  Kier Minerals – Greenburn Surface Mine
 >  Kier Group – Tempsford Head Office
  From a Group perspective these businesses/sites represent: 
 >  61% of the selected Environment and climate change data;
 >  39% of the selected Workplace data; 
 >  100% of the selected Marketplace data; 
 >  51% of the selected Community engagement data; and
 >  100% of the selected Considerate Constructors Scheme 
data.
What are our conclusions?
The following conclusions should be read in conjunction with the 
work performed and scope of our assurance engagement described 
above.
>  Nothing has come to our attention to suggest that the 
performance data marked with the symbol *, on pages 26 to 
32, are not fairly stated, in all material respects in accordance 
with the relevant internal reporting guidelines for the selected 
performance data.

Revenue has slightly decreased by 4% 
(£86m), mainly as a result of the 5% 
reduction in our Construction revenues. 
This was a result of poor weather in 
the first quarter of this calendar year 
causing delays and pushing revenues 
into the 2014 financial year. We also 
experienced a change in the mix 
of activities. UK building revenue 
decreased to approximately £1bn, 
as we maintained a focus on the 
quality of work we pursued; however, 
this reduction was partially mitigated 
by growth in UK infrastructure and 
overseas revenues. 
In Services, all three businesses, 
housing maintenance, FM and 
environmental, achieved revenues 
at similar levels to last year, totalling 
£437m. This result reflected our 
success in renewing existing contracts 
and securing new business, while 
acknowledging the continued budget 
constraints faced by many public sector 
customers. 
The revenue from our Property division 
results from the ongoing progress 
of our combined £1.5bn property 
development and mixed-tenure housing 
pipeline and the level of private housing 
sales achieved.
Operating profit* including joint ventures 
was 6% lower than last year at £69.7m 
mainly as a result of the lower contribution 
from the Construction division.
The operating margin* in Construction 
of 2.3% was a strong performance 
in today’s market. It reflected 
the increasing proportion of UK 
infrastructure and overseas operations, 
the selective approach we have to new 
work and the prudent profit recognition 
policy we operate.
In Services, we achieved an operating 
margin* of 4.4%, in line with our 
expectations and included a higher 
level of bidding and mobilisation costs 
following the success in securing major 
schemes, such as Circle and East 
Sussex. 
The Property division, which includes 
our property development activities, the 
£4.3m operating profit of our housing 
businesses, and the disposal profits 
from selling four of our PFI investments, 
contributed £20.5m of the total Group 
operating profit; a similar level to 
last year. The property development 
business achieved its target of 
15% return on capital and our PFI 
investments were replaced at a similar 
rate to the disposals. 
Detailed information on the operating 
performance of each of the divisions is 
provided within the operational review.
The total corporate cost of £0.5m has 
decreased compared with 2012 mainly 
due to a pension credit that related to 
the Group’s defined benefit pension 
schemes, partially offset by higher IT 
expenditure and the costs involved in 
establishing the new Group website. 
This pension credit was a direct result 
of changes in the underlying pension 
assumptions, in particular the discount 
rate and the expected return on assets. 
The Group’s net finance cost, analysed 
below, included interest payable arising 
from an average month-end net debt 
balance of £4m (2012: net cash £95m) 
after considerable investment during 
the year, and reflected the timing of our 
property transactions, some of which 
completed in the last quarter of the 
financial year.

There were three key areas of this 
year’s exceptional charge.
>  £12.0m relating to the 
comprehensive restructuring 
programme mainly in the 
Construction division, which is 
predominantly complete. It has 
resulted in an 8% reduction in the 
staff cost base to ensure we 
maintain our Construction operating 
margins at around 2%. More 
specifically, £1.9m of these costs 
related to the closure of the 
scaffolding, joinery and temporary 
electrical businesses, while the 
remainder included office 
rationalisation and associated staff 
reductions. We will however, ensure 
the business retains its geographical 
spread and local presence;
Exceptional items
Exceptional items amounted to a charge before tax of £17.0m (2012: £3.6m),  
as follows:
2013  
£m
2012  
£m
Restructuring programme (10.1) –
Closure and discontinuation of scaffolding and related businesses  (1.9) –
Loss on disposal of the tower crane and other discontinued businesses  (3.2) –
Costs relating to the acquisition of May Gurney Integrated Services plc  (1.8) –
Disposal of the majority of the plant business and related costs – (3.2)
Acquisition of 50% of Biogen (UK) Limited   – (0.4)
Total exceptional items (17.0) (3.6)
During the year, we considerably 
strengthened our capital structure as 
described in the ‘Treasury facilities 
and policies’ section on page 39. 
These changes follow on from the 
renegotiations of our revolving credit 
facilities last year and have therefore 
increased the interest payable and fees 
on committed borrowings to £3.0m for 
the year. 
The unwinding of the discount on long-
term liabilities was mainly a result of 
the Lloyds property portfolio acquisition 
in April 2011; the final consideration 
payment of £26m is due to be paid in 
October 2013.
Profit before tax* decreased by 9% to 
£63.4m (2012: £70.0m). This is stated 
before minority interests of £1.0m 
(2012: £1.1m). The minority interest 
relates to the share of profits of our 
housing maintenance business which 
are attributable to contracts with  
local authorities.
*  Underlying operating profits and margins, pre-tax 
profits and EPS are stated before amortisation 
of intangible assets relating to contract rights 
of £3.4m (2012: £3.4m) and exceptional items 
totalling £17.0m (2012: £3.6m).
>  £3.2m relating to the disposal of the 
tower crane business, which 
completed in August 2013. The costs 
associated with the transaction were 
recognised in the year ended 30 June 
2013 and comprised the loss on 
disposal of some of the fixed assets, 
together with transaction and 
redundancy costs; and
>  £1.8m of acquisition costs relating to 
the May Gurney transaction.
The cash outflow during the year in 
respect of the above was approximately 
£11m.
The Group’s effective tax rate* 
including joint venture tax on joint 
venture profits, has increased from 
13% last year to 14%, approximately 
9% below the standard corporation 
tax rate. This low rate did not relate to 
aggressive tax planning schemes but 
reflected the benefit of the Group’s 
prudence in the past, the contribution 
from selling four of our PFI investments 
and the reduction in the standard 
corporation tax rate.
Earnings per share* was 13% lower 
than last year at 136.2p (2012: 
156.8p) as a result of the lower 
underlying profits and the increase 
in the weighted average number of 
shares. The two key components of the 
increase in weighted number of shares 
were the scrip dividend alternative 
that we offer our shareholders and our 
employee Save As you Earn scheme.

Group has invested 
approximately 
£77m during the

Cash performance
The Group delivered a solid cash 
performance, with an average month-
end net debt balance of £4m after 
considerable investment across the 
Group and the completion of a number 
of our property transactions in the last 
quarter of the financial year.
This performance produced a net cash 
position at 30 June 2013 of £60m 
(2012: £129m) after deducting £92m 
relating to the $100m (£62m) US 
private placements and the £30m 
Funding for Lending Scheme loan. 
Further details of the new facilities are 
provided in the ‘Treasury facilities and 
policies’ section on page 39. 
Overall, the Group has invested 
approximately £77m during the year in 
its own growth, including mining land, 
options and equipment, refuse vehicles 
and ongoing investment in the Property 
division, including Solum, our joint 
venture with Network Rail, and Biogen, 
our anaerobic digestion business.
Within the Group cash balance at 30 
June 2013, Construction at £320m and 
Services at £30m represented resilient 
performances. In addition to underlying 
trading, these performances included 
approximately £20m of capital and 
investment related expenditure, a £9m 
cash effect of the restructuring 
activities and a working capital outflow 
of £17m mainly in Construction. Our 
working capital environment remains 
challenging as more stringent supply 
chain payment terms continue to be 
introduced and due to the changing mix 
of construction workload with more 
infrastructure projects which are 
typically of a target cost, reimbursable 
nature. It is reassuring to see, however, 
that the working capital trends that 
particularly affected our UK building 
operations in the first six months of the 
financial year did not significantly affect 
the second half of the year. 
In Property, the net debt position of 
£40m reflects our ongoing investment 
strategy to increase the cash deployed 
in our property development business 
to £100m, which will be achieved 
during the next 12 months as we 
progress with our £1.1bn development 
pipeline. The net debt position across 
our housing businesses reduced to 
£226m following unit and land sale 
receipts, partially offset by investment 
in new housing land and an increase

Order books
We have maintained our order books 
in Construction and Services at a 
combined level of more than £4bn, 
as shown in the table below. This 
means we enter the new financial 
year in a strong position with all of 
the Construction division’s targeted 
revenue and 95% of the Services 
division’s targeted revenue for 2014 
secure and probable. 
The Services division secured and 
probable position is in line with the 
equivalent position last year while 
Construction is at least 10% ahead 
demonstrating the strength of these 
businesses particularly in the current 
trading environment.
With the addition of May Gurney 
(£1.7bn), our enlarged order book

Dividend policy
We continue to maintain our 
progressive dividend policy and taking 
into account the performance of the 
Group, the level of order books and its 
strong capital structure, the Board has 
recommended a final dividend of 46.5p, 
making the full year dividend 68p, an 
increase of 3% on the total paid in 
respect of 2012 (66p). This reflects 
the confidence in the business going 
forward and is 2.0 times covered by 
underlying earnings per share.
Treasury facilities and policies 
As at 30 June 2013 the Group had 
revolving credit facilities, totalling 
£120m, an uncommitted £20m 
overdraft facility and long-term debt of 
£92m, all managed by the centralised 
treasury function.
During the year we considerably 
strengthened our capital structure. In 
December 2012, we completed £62m 
($100m) of US private placements 
(USPP) for seven and ten-year terms, 
which serviced the expiration, in 
February 2013, of our previous £30m 
ten-year USPP and, in January 2013, 
we secured a £30m loan under the 
Government’s Funding for Lending 
Scheme, over four years. These 
changes follow the renegotiation of our 
revolving credit facilities last year. 
Historically, Kier has operated with 
a relatively ungeared balance sheet. 
However, as customers have become 
more conscious of the need to manage 
their working capital, so have the 
demands on construction and services 
company balance sheets. Accordingly, 
we have extended our facilities over the 
medium term to manage this changing 
requirement for funding, and to provide 
capacity for ongoing investment across 
the Group.
The Group’s financial instruments 
comprise cash and liquid investments. 
The Group, largely through its PFI and 
Property joint ventures, enters into 
derivatives transactions (principally, 
interest rate swaps) to manage interest 
rate risks arising from its operations 
and its sources of finance. We do not 
enter into speculative transactions.
There are minor foreign currency risks 
arising from operations. The Group 
has a limited number of overseas 
operations in different currencies. 
Currency exposure to overseas 
assets is hedged through inter-
company balances and borrowings, 
so that assets denominated in foreign 
currencies are matched, as far as 
possible, by liabilities. Where there 
may be further exposure to foreign 
currency fluctuations, forward exchange 
contracts are completed to buy and sell 
foreign currency.
Balance sheet 
Total net assets at 30 June 2013 were 
£158m (2012: £154m) and included 
intangible assets of £30m (2012: 
£29m) of which £13m (2012: £11m) 
related to contract rights. 
Corporate activity
During the period from July 2012 
to August 2013, we completed and 
announced three transactions as 
follows:
>  In August 2012, we completed our 
investment in Biogen (UK) Limited 
for a maximum total investment 
of £24.4m, of which £5.4m was 
invested on completion and a further 
£2.5m in December 2012. The 
remaining £16.5m is scheduled to be 
invested over the next three years.
>  In July 2013, we completed the 
acquisition of May Gurney for a 
consideration of £223m. Further 
details are in the ‘May Gurney’ 
section on page 41.
>  In August 2013, we completed the 
disposal of our tower crane business 
for approximately £5m, in line with 
our strategy of withdrawing from non-
core operations.

Inventories  
At 30 June 2013, residential land and 
work in progress totalled a combined 
£249m, a decrease of £7m compared 
with the June 2012 balance of £256m. 
This decrease reflects unit and land 
sales over the year, partially offset by 
purchases of new housing land and 
further investment in work in progress 
in our mixed-tenure housing business.
At 30 June 2013, our land bank 
comprised 4,005 plots, down from 
4,180 at 30 June 2012, all with 
planning permission. It remains our 
focus to reduce the cash locked up 
in our land and work in progress for 
future investment in the Group. As we 
have stated previously, the majority of 
our land was purchased before 2008 
and therefore we do not anticipate 
recognising profit from land disposals, 
the focus being on cash generation.
Pensions
The Group participates in two principal 
schemes: the Kier Group Pension 
Scheme, which includes a defined 
benefit section, and a defined benefit 
scheme on behalf of its employees 
in Kier Sheffield LLP. The financial 
statements reflect the pension scheme 
deficits calculated in accordance with 
IAS 19. 
At 30 June 2013, the net deficit of the 
Kier Group Pension Scheme was £37m 
(2012: £45m). The market value of the 
scheme’s assets was £784m (2012: 
£722m) and the net present value 
of the liabilities was £832m (2012: 
£781m). The decrease in the net deficit 
was a result of changes in the key 
assumptions, particularly the higher 
than expected asset returns together 
with increased contributions. 
We continue to progress with our 
recovery plan of additional annual 
deficit contributions of £8m and we 
make available our Property and PFI 
investments where appropriate. In June 
2013 we completed the disposal of 
certain properties located in Sydenham, 
London for £46m to Kier Sydenham, 
a limited partnership, 50% of which 
is owned by Kier, with the remaining 
50% owned by the trustees of the Kier 
Group Pension Scheme. The Group is 
committed to continuing to support the 
funding position of the scheme.

to Kier Sheffield LLP showed a net

IAS 19 re-presentation
The new pensions accounting will come

financial year, and will therefore require 
restatement of the 2013 figures, as 
comparatives. The expected return on 
scheme assets and the interest cost on 
scheme liabilities, currently reported in 
the income statement, will be replaced 
with an interest charge on the net 
deficit. 
The table below highlights the £17m

comparative figures for the June 2013 
financial year will change by a similar

The difference of £17m will be 
re-presented in the statement of 
comprehensive income. It should be 
noted however, that this accounting 
change has no impact on cash and  
no impact on the pension deficit.

Business
risks
How the Group manages risk  
and assurance
The Board is responsible for the Group’ s 
system of risk management and internal 
controls and the Group risk management 
framework, which sets out the mechanism 
and reporting structure to ensure that key 
risks are continually monitored and any 
action plans to mitigate the risks are 
reviewed. A Group assurance map is  
used to co-ordinate the various assurance 
providers within the Group.
The Board has delegated to the Risk 
Management and Audit Committee the 
responsibility for reviewing the 
effectiveness of the Group’ s internal 
controls, including the systems 
established to identify, assess, manage 
and monitor risk and provide assurance. 
In addition to the ongoing monitoring of 
risk and controls, a report detailing the 
key risks, together with an assessment  
of the controls in place to mitigate these 
risks and any action plans, is prepared 
annually and reviewed by the Risk 
Management and Audit Committee.  
The last report was prepared in March 
2013 and reviewed at the June 2013 
committee meeting. The Board has 
concluded that the Group maintained 
sound risk management and internal 
control systems throughout the year 
ended 30 June 2013.
Other processes of assurance are 
managed through the Group’ s standing 
orders, the Executive Management Team,  
a range of Group policies and several 
central function committees (including the 
Group Corporate Responsibility Steering 
Committee and the Group Safety, Health 
and Environment Steering Committee,  
both being chaired by the chief executive 
and reporting regularly to the Board).
Principal risks
The nature of the industries and the 
business environment in which the Group 
operates are inherently risky. Although it  
is recognised that it is not possible to 
eliminate all such risks and uncertainties, 
the Group has well-established risk 
management and internal control 
systems to manage them, which have 
also helped the Group respond to the 
changing business environment and the 
challenges presented during the year.
As a result of the comprehensive 
operational review of the business and 
the integration of May Gurney, the Group 
is experiencing a period of organisational 
change. These changes impact on a 
number of the Group’ s principal business 
risks which are described on the following 
pages, particularly those associated with 
people, health and safety, reputation and 
information technology. These risks have 
been identified by the Board and the Risk 
Management and Audit Committee as 
requiring particular focus and a steering 
group, led by the chief operating officer 
and reporting regularly to the Board, has 
been established to address them and 
ensure that appropriate controls are in 
place to mitigate them.
The key to the continued success of the 
Group’ s business strategy is its ability to 
identify and manage effectively the risks to  
its businesses and operations. The Group’ s 
approach is to identify the key risks and 
then assess the effectiveness of controls 
to mitigate the impact and likelihood of 
these risks occurring.
The Group’ s risk management framework 
requires all divisions and operating 
businesses within them to identify and 
assess the key risks facing them which 
could impact on their ability to deliver 
their objectives. The Group, the divisions 
and the operating businesses maintain 
risk registers which are used to 
document the key risks facing the 
business, together with an assessment 
of the likelihood and impact of each risk 
occurring as well as an assessment of 
the effectiveness of the key controls in 
place to mitigate the risk. Action plans 
are developed and put in place to 
mitigate potential exposures. These risk 
registers are regularly reviewed to identify 
new risks as they arise and to monitor 
the action plans.

Financial and legal risks
Legal and regulatory
The Group is subject to a number of complex, demanding and evolving 
legal and regulatory requirements. A breach of laws or regulations 
could lead to legal proceedings, investigations or disputes resulting  
in a disruption of business, ranging from additional costs incurred  
on a project to civil and/or criminal penalties as well as reputational 
damage.
The Group monitors and responds to legal and regulatory 
developments in the areas in which it operates. It is the Group’s policy 
to require that all of its subsidiaries, employees, suppliers and 
subcontractors comply with applicable laws and regulations. Training is 
provided on relevant areas of law and regulation, including e-learning 
courses, to keep all parties fully aware of their responsibilities. 
Contracts entered into by the Group are subjected to a review process 
to ensure that contractual risks are identified and, wherever possible, 
mitigated appropriately.
The Group adopts a selective approach to making investments  
(for example, PFI projects) and seeks to mitigate the associated risk.  
For example, it makes investments in sectors in which it has 
established construction and facilities management expertise. When 
investing in a new sector or business, the Group will conduct due 
diligence on the risks relating to the sector or business, using both 
internal and external resources and advice, and these risks and their 
mitigation will be considered as part of the Group’s review and 
authorisation process.
Steps have been taken over time to reduce the volatility and extent of 
the Group’s funding exposure, including closing the defined benefit 
scheme to new joiners in 2002, the introduction of an annual upper 
limit on salary increases which count for defined benefits purposes in 
2009 and investment in a portfolio of inflation and interest swaps to 
mitigate the financial impact of adverse moves in prevailing rates.
The trustees of the Kier Group Pension Scheme and the Group Board 
regularly review the effectiveness of these measures and consider  
further liability management opportunities.
Cash forecasts and balances are prepared regularly so as to provide 
up-to-date and accurate information on the Group’s cash position.  
Borrowing facilities are in place which have been recently renegotiated 
and extended. The Group has strong, long-term relationships with its 
bondsmen and has an in-house team which monitors headroom and 
advises on bond terms and conditions.
The Group has created a structure to manage and mitigate risk with 
the following key components:
>  a wide geographic regional network of offices across the UK  
 providing strong integration into local communities, its client base  
 and supply chain;
>  a strong level of framework agreements and partnerships with   
 government, local authorities and the private sector; and
>   a strong sector diversity allowing it to react to evolving opportunities 
in the marketplace.
The Group also carries out monthly and quarterly reviews of its 
workload and forecasts its overhead levels as a percentage of future 
work in order to maintain a steady ratio of overhead costs to revenue. 
Fuel and other materials that are in high demand, such as steel, are 
hedged or forward-purchased when deemed necessary.
Investment
The Group recognises that there are risks associated with the 
investments which it may choose to make. This is particularly the case 
when the Group invests in new market sectors or acquires new 
businesses.
Pensions
In relation to its defined benefit scheme, the Group is exposed to 
funding risks arising from improvements in longevity, unfavourable 
economic conditions and investment performance. Where the actual 
outcomes are different to the actuary’s assumptions, additional 
funding may be required to meet the cost of promised pension 
benefits.
Finance and bonding facilities
The Group’s long-term business is dependent upon cash resources, 
facilities and the ability to provide performance and other bonds  
as necessary.
Risk description Mitigation
Macro-economic climate
The order books for the Group’s Construction and Services divisions 
are dependent upon the level of expenditure in the public sector and 
the availability of credit for private sector expenditure. Financial 
markets continue to be dominated by developments in the Eurozone 
area. In the UK, credit growth remains subdued with lending conditions 
facing individuals and companies continuing to tighten. In addition, the 
impact of the recent extension to the asset purchase programme 
remains uncertain, as do the effects of the introduction of the Funding 
for Lending Scheme and the ‘UK Guarantees’ scheme for 
infrastructure funding. Instability in global exchange rates could 
significantly escalate material and fuel prices, thereby putting pressure 
on some project cost forecasts.

People
The Group is dependent on members of its senior management team 
and on a flexible, highly skilled and well-motivated workforce and 
believes its future success will depend, in part, on its ability to attract, 
develop and retain its people. If the Group does not succeed in 
attracting, developing and retaining skilled people it may not be able  
to grow the business as anticipated.
The Group monitors staff turnover closely and pay and conditions are 
reviewed regularly against the prevailing market and benchmarked to 
ensure that we remain competitive.
Succession planning and staff development are key at all levels in the 
Group. The Group has a performance review process which is designed 
to assist in the career development of its staff and also to identify 
potential successors to roles within the Group (including at senior 
management level).
Detailed policies and procedures exist to minimise such risks and are 
subject to review and monitoring by the operating businesses and 
Group. All operating businesses have a director who is responsible for 
coordinating health and safety activities.
In order to protect and enhance its reputation, the Group has a robust 
series of business ethics, sustainability and compliance policies that 
help deliver the Group’s corporate responsibility programme, which 
addresses issues such as health and safety, environmental impact, 
climate change, employees, customers and supply chain and 
community engagement.
Health, safety and environmental
The Group’s activities require the continuous monitoring and 
management of health, safety and environmental risks. Failure  
to manage these risks could cause injury to its employees and 
subcontractors and could expose the Group to significant potential 
liability and reputational damage.
Reputation
The Group’s ability to tender for new business and its relationship with 
its range of customers, supply chain partners, its employees and other 
stakeholders depends in large part on the good reputation that it has 
established and how it is perceived by others.
People and reputational risks
Risk description Mitigation Annual Report and Accounts 2013 —— 45   
Operational risks
Contract and build
The Group carries out several hundred contracts annually and the risks 
to which the Group is exposed are dependent upon the nature of the 
work, the duration of the contract and the legal form of the contract.
The Group’s appetite for very long-term, large, competitively tendered 
construction contracts is limited, driven by the desire to maintain 
quality of workload and manage risk. Tenders for contracts are subject 
to approval by the Board, the chief executive and the finance director 
or divisional directors, depending upon the value and nature of the 
contract. Contracts in progress are controlled and managed through 
the Group’s operating structure and procedures, including rigorous and 
regular review of the forecast revenue and costs to complete.
The Services division operates a contract review and tender 
adjudication process to ensure that risks are identified and, wherever 
possible, mitigated. The tender process is as described above under 
“Contract and build”. Similarly, contracts in progress are controlled 
and managed as described above under “Contract and build”.
Group IT centrally manages the majority of systems across the Group. 
Other IT systems are managed locally by experienced IT personnel. 
Significant investments in IT systems are subject to Board review  
and approval. In addition, the Group has an Information Security 
Committee which focuses on data security.
Site evaluation is a key process and site appraisals are carried out  
in detail, including using external advice where appropriate. Land and 
development acquisitions are subject to approval by the Board, the 
chief executive and the finance director or divisional directors 
depending upon the value of the land. Developments in progress are 
controlled and managed through the Group’s operating structure and 
procedures including rigorous and regular review of the forecast 
financials and sales activity. The Board allocates capital on a portfolio 
basis ensuring diversification and the efficient use of resources within 
the Group.
In the case of the Property division, development risk is controlled  
by ensuring construction generally commences once the division has 
either pre-sold or pre-let key elements of the development.
The Group assesses the financial strength of counterparties before 
entering into contract and structures payments so as to mitigate its 
financial exposure to them for the duration of our relationship. Where 
the Group is particularly dependent upon the continued financial 
strength of the providers of key financial services to the Group, it takes 
steps to spread this exposure across a range of counterparties so as 
to diversify risk.
 
The Group has in place a number of business continuity plans at site 
and business unit level which are regularly reviewed and monitored to 
ensure their continued effectiveness. The purpose of these plans is to 
ensure that, wherever possible, the relevant project or business can 
continue to operate effectively after the occurrence of a disaster or an 
adverse event.
Services
The Services division enters into a large number of contracts each 
year, the risks associated with which depend, in particular, on the 
nature of the work being undertaken and the duration of the contract. 
Typically, the length of a contract will be greater than those entered 
into by the Construction division and, in addition to risks relating to 
contract performance, may contain risks in relation to the transfer  
of employees and other associated issues.
Information technology
The efficient operation of the Group is increasingly dependent upon  
the proper operation, performance and development of its IT systems. 
Failure to manage or integrate IT systems or failure to successfully 
implement changes in IT systems could result in a loss of control over 
critical business information and/or systems. This, in turn, could 
impact the Group’s ability to fulfill its contractual obligations.
Risk description Mitigation
Land and property development acquisition
The cost and quality of property and land is fundamental to the 
profitability of the Group’s property development and housing 
business.
Counterparty
The Group depends, for its success, on the stability of its customers, 
joint venture partners, suppliers, subcontractors, funders, bondsmen 
and insurers. Failure in these counterparties could result in  
non-collection of amounts owed or disruption and delays to contract 
progress.
Business continuity
The Group faces a number of risks which are, in large part, beyond  
its control. Its business and operations may be interrupted by natural 
disasters or any other disasters which may have the potential to affect 
adversely the Group’s performance.

Directors’
report
Introduction 
The directors present their annual report 
and audited financial statements as at, 
and for the year ended, 30 June 2013.
This directors’ report should be read 
in conjunction with the chairman’s 
statement, the chief executive’s review, 
the corporate governance statement and 
the directors’ remuneration report, each 
of which is incorporated by reference 
in (and shall be deemed to form part 
of) this directors’ report to the extent 
required by applicable law or regulation.
Principal activities  
The Group’s principal activities 
during the course of the year were 
construction, services and property.
A review of the Group’s business and 
progress during the year is included 
within the chairman’s statement on 
pages 4 and 5, the chief executive’s 
review on pages 8 to 11 and the 
operational review on pages 12 to 25.
Results and dividends 
The Group’s profit for the year after 
taxation and exceptional items was 
£38.6m (2012: £55.3m). An interim 
dividend of 21.5p per share (2012: 
21.5p), amounting to £8.5m (2012: 
£8.2m), was paid on 17 May 2013. 
The directors propose a final dividend 
of 46.5p per share (2012: 44.5p per 
share), amounting to £25.4m (2012: 
£17.4m), payable on 27 November 
2013 to shareholders on the register  
of members on 20 September 2013.
Directors 
Biographical details of the directors of 
the Company are shown on pages 46 
and 47. Details of directors’ interests 
in the Company’s shares are disclosed 
in the directors’ remuneration report on 
pages 58 to 67. 
Qualifying third party indemnities 
The articles of association of the 
Company (the Articles) entitle the 
directors of the Company, to the 
extent permitted by the Companies Act 
2006 and other applicable legislation 
(together, the Companies Acts), to be 
indemnified out of the assets of the 
Company in the event that they suffer 
any expenses in connection with certain 
proceedings relating to the execution of 
their duties as directors of the Company.
In addition, and in common with many 
other companies, the Company has 
insurance in favour of its directors and 
officers in respect of certain losses or 
liabilities to which they may be exposed 
due to their office.
The UK Corporate Governance Code 
A statement on the Group’s corporate 
governance is set out on pages 52 to 57.
Going concern  
The Group has considerable financial 
resources, together with long-term 
contracts with a number of customers and 
suppliers across its business activities. 
As a consequence, the directors believe 
that the Group is well-placed to manage 
its business risks effectively.
After making appropriate enquiries, 
the directors of the Company have a 
reasonable expectation that the Company 
and the Group have adequate resources 
to continue in operational existence for 
the foreseeable future. Accordingly, the 
directors continue to adopt the going 
concern basis in preparing the Group’s 
financial statements.
Further information relating to the 
financial position of the Group, its cash 
flows, liquidity position and borrowing 
facilities is given in the financial review 
on pages 34 to 41.
Charitable and political donations 
During the year, the Group’s donations 
to charity in the United Kingdom 
were £58,000 (2012: £122,000), 
principally to local charities serving the 
communities in which it operates. The 
Group has considerable involvement 
in such communities, as described 
in the corporate responsibility report 
on pages 26 to 33. In addition, the 
Group has entered into a partnership 
with Barnardo’s, further details of 
which are referred to in the corporate 
responsibility statement. 
No political donations were made 
during the year (2012: nil). 
Financial instruments 
Details of the financial risk 
management objectives and policies of 
the Group, together with its exposure 
to material financial risks, are set out 
in notes 1 and 27 to the consolidated 
financial statements.
Research and development 
The Group undertakes research 
and development activity in creating 
innovative construction techniques 
and design integral to the delivery of 
its projects. The direct expenditure 
incurred is not separately identifiable, 
as the investment is usually contained 
within the relevant project.
Employees  
The companies in the Group are equal 
opportunities employers. The Group 
gives consideration to applications 
for employment made by disabled 
persons (having regard to their particular 
aptitudes and abilities) and encourages 
and assists, whenever practicable, the 
recruitment, training, career development 
and promotion of disabled people and 
the retention of, and appropriate training 
for, those who become disabled during 
the course of their employment and 
who can be employed in a safe working 
environment. The Group’s approach 
to employee involvement, equal 
opportunities, health and safety and the 
environment is set out in the corporate 
responsibility report on pages 26 to 33.
The Group provides relevant information 
on matters of concern to employees 
through newsletters, video addresses, 
the Group’s intranet, social media and 
formal and informal meetings with various 
groups of employees and management. 
These arrangements aim to achieve 
a common awareness on the part of 
employees on matters affecting the 
performance of the Group. The Group 
also consults with employees to ascertain 
their views in relation to decisions which 
are likely to affect their interests. 
The Group operates the Kier Group 
plc 2006 Sharesave Scheme (the 
Sharesave Scheme) for eligible 
employees and makes available a 
dealing service to enable employees to 
buy and sell its shares with a minimum 
of formality. The Group also operates 
an all employee share ownership plan 
(the AESOP) for all employees, which 
includes a share-matching element.  Annual Report and Accounts 2013 —— 49   
In addition, as a result of the acquisition 
of May Gurney, the Group operates The 
May Gurney Savings Related Share 
Option Scheme, which is similar to 
the Sharesave Scheme. Participants 
in this scheme have been offered the 
opportunity to exchange their existing 
May Gurney shares for new options over 
shares in the capital of the Company.
Policy and practice on payment  
of creditors  
The Group agrees payments with 
its suppliers and subcontractors on 
an individual contract basis rather 
than following a code or standard 
on payment practice. The Group’s 
policy is to abide by these agreed 
terms whenever the relevant Group 
company is satisfied that the suppliers 
or subcontractors have provided the 
goods or services in accordance with 
the contract terms and conditions. 
The aggregate amount owed to trade 
creditors by the Company at 30 June 
2013 was nil (2012: nil).
Subsidiary trading companies within 
the Group, acting in accordance with 
the above policy, exhibit creditor days 
averaging 36 days (2012: 26) in 
respect of suppliers of invoiced goods 
and services and 33 days (2012: 19) 
in respect of certified amounts due to 
subcontractors. These figures exclude 
amounts not currently due for payment but 
which are included within trade creditors.
Share capital  
As at 30 June 2013, the issued share 
capital of the Company comprised 
a single class of ordinary shares of 
1 pence each. As at 30 June 2013, 
39,848,072 shares in the capital of 
the Company were in issue. During the 
year, 102,669 shares were issued in 
relation to the scrip dividend alternative 
and 922,219 shares were issued in 
connection with the Sharesave Scheme. 
No other shares were issued during 
the year. As at 11 September 2013, 
54,711,711 shares in the capital of the 
Company were in issue, the increase 
since 30 June 2013 arising principally 
as a result of 14,714,445 shares 
having been issued on 8 July 2013 in 
connection with the acquisition of May 
Gurney. Details of the Company’s share 
capital are set out in note 24 to the 
consolidated financial statements.
Subject to the provisions of the Articles 
and the Companies Acts, shares 
may be issued with such rights or 
restrictions as the Company may by 
ordinary resolution determine or, if the 
Company has not so determined, as the 
directors may decide.
Restrictions on transfer of securities in 
the Company  
There are no restrictions on the transfer 
of securities in the Company, except:
>  that certain restrictions may from 
time to time be imposed by law 
or regulation (for example, insider 
trading laws); and
>  pursuant to the Listing Rules of 
the Financial Services Authority 
(the Listing Rules), whereby certain 
employees require approval to deal 
in the Company’s shares.
The Company is not aware of any 
agreements between holders of securities 
that may result in restrictions on the 
transfer of securities in the Company.
Substantial voting rights  
As at 11 September 2013, the Company 
had been notified of the following interests 
in the ordinary share capital of the 
Company (being voting rights over such 
share capital), pursuant to Rule 5.1 of 
the Disclosure and Transparency Rules:
Standard Life Investments 
Limited
 
6.9%
Schroders plc 5.4%
Norges Bank 4.3%
Securities carrying special rights 
No person holds securities in the 
Company carrying special rights with 
regard to control of the Company.
Rights under employees’ share schemes 
As at 30 June 2013, RBC Trustees 
(Guernsey) Limited (RBC), as trustee 
of the Kier Group 1999 Employee 
Benefit Trust (the Trust), held 485,081 
shares (approximately 1.1% of the 
issued share capital of the Company 
as at that date) on trust for the benefit 
of the employees of the Group. The 
Trust was established for the purposes 
of satisfying awards of shares made 
to individuals under the Group’s 
remuneration and long-term incentive 
arrangements. During the year, RBC 
waived the dividends payable in respect 
of these 455,686 shares, but received 
the dividends in respect of further 
29,395 shares (being the shares to 
which certain directors and senior 
managers are beneficially entitled as 
a result of their annual bonus being 
satisfied in part by an allocation of 
shares). RBC, in turn, transferred the 
dividends to the relevant directors and 
senior managers.
As at 30 June 2013, Computershare 
Investor Services PLC held 972,884 
shares (approximately 2.4% of the 
issued share capital of the Company as 
at that date) on trust for the benefit of 
staff and former staff who are members 
of the AESOP.
Voting 
Subject to any terms upon which the 
relevant shares may have been issued 
or are subject and to the Articles, every 
member present in person or by proxy 
at a general meeting and entitled to 
vote has, upon a show of hands, one 
vote and, upon a poll, one vote for every 
share held. In the case of joint holders 
of a share, the vote of the senior who 
tenders a vote, whether in person or by 
proxy, will be accepted to the exclusion 
of the votes of the other joint holders 
and, for this purpose, seniority will be 
determined by the order in which the 
names stand in the register in respect 
of the joint holding.
Overview Financial statements Governance Financial review Corporate responsibility Operational review 50 —— Kier Group plc 
Restrictions on voting rights 
No member shall, unless the Board 
otherwise determines, be entitled to 
vote at any general meeting in respect 
of any share held by it unless all calls 
or other sums then payable by it in 
respect of that share have been paid 
or if that member has been served 
with a disenfranchisement notice (as 
defined in the Articles) after failure to 
provide the Company with information 
concerning interests in that share 
required to be provided under the 
Companies Acts.
The Company is not aware of any 
agreements between holders of 
securities that may result in restrictions 
on voting rights.
Appointment and replacement  
of directors 
The directors shall be not less than  
three and not more than 12 in number.  
The Company may by ordinary resolution 
vary the minimum and/or maximum 
number of directors.
Directors may be appointed by the 
Company by ordinary resolution or by 
the Board. A director appointed by the 
Board holds office only until the next 
annual general meeting of the Company 
after his/her appointment and is then 
eligible to stand for election.
Pursuant to the Articles, at every annual 
general meeting of the Company, 
one-third of the directors who are 
subject to the requirement to retire 
by rotation (not including any director 
who was appointed by the Board and 
is standing for election) will retire 
from office and may offer themselves 
for re-election by the members. The 
directors to retire by rotation will be 
those who have been longest in office 
since their last election. However, at 
the forthcoming annual general meeting 
of the Company, notwithstanding 
the provisions of the Articles, all the 
directors will offer themselves for 
re-election in accordance with the UK 
Corporate Governance Code. 
The Company may by ordinary resolution, 
of which special notice has been given, 
remove any director before the expiry of 
the director’s period of office. The office 
of a director will be vacated if: 
(i)  the director becomes bankrupt or 
the subject of an interim receiving 
order or makes any arrangement 
or composition with his creditors 
generally or applies to the court for 
an interim order in connection with 
a voluntary arrangement under the 
Insolvency Act 1986; 
(ii)  the director is certified as having 
become physically or mentally 
incapable of acting as a director and 
may remain so for more than three 
months; 
(iii)  the director ceases to be a director 
by virtue of the Companies Acts or 
becomes prohibited by law from 
being a director; 
(iv)   the director receives written notice 
from not less than three-quarters 
of the other directors removing the 
director from office; or
(v)  in the case of a director who holds 
executive office, the director ceases 
to hold such office and the majority 
of the other directors resolve that the 
relevant director’s office be vacated.
Amendment of Articles 
The Articles may be amended by a 
special resolution of the Company’s 
shareholders.
Powers of the directors 
Subject to the Articles, the Companies 
Acts and any directions given by the 
Company by special resolution, the 
business of the Company will be 
managed by the Board, which may 
exercise all the powers of the Company.
Powers in relation to the Company 
issuing its shares 
The directors were granted authority 
at the annual general meeting on 15 
November 2012 to allot shares in the 
Company in accordance with section 
551 of the Companies Act 2006 (i)
up to an aggregate nominal amount of 
£132,147 and (ii) up to an aggregate 
nominal amount of £264,295 in 
connection with a rights issue. The 
directors were also granted authority 
to allot shares non-pre-emptively and 
wholly for cash up to an aggregate 
nominal amount of £19,822. These 
authorities will expire on the date of 
this year’s annual general meeting 
and resolutions to renew them will be 
proposed at the forthcoming annual 
general meeting. In addition, an 
ordinary resolution will be proposed 
to grant the directors the authority to 
continue to offer the scrip dividend 
alternative. In accordance with the 
requirements of investor protection 
committees, this authority is renewed 
every five years.
Powers in relation to the Company 
buying back its shares 
The Company may only buy back  
shares if the Articles do not prohibit  
it from doing so and it has received the 
requisite authority from shareholders  
in general meeting. Although the 
Articles do not contain any such 
prohibition, the Company did not 
request any such authority at its  
last annual general meeting and does  
not propose to do so at the forthcoming 
annual general meeting.
Change of control

Auditor 
The Group’s auditor, KPMG Audit Plc, 
has instigated an orderly wind-down  
of its business. The Board has therefore 
decided that KPMG LLP will be proposed 
as the Group’s auditor for the financial 
year ending 30 June 2014 and a 
resolution relating to this appointment 
will be tabled at the forthcoming annual 
general meeting.
Each director who holds office at the 
date of approval of this directors’ report 
confirms that, so far as each such 
director is aware, there is no relevant 
audit information of which the auditor is 
unaware; and the directors have taken 
all the steps that they ought to have 
taken as directors to make themselves 
aware of any relevant audit information 
and to establish that the auditor is 
aware of that information.
Annual general meeting 
The annual general meeting of the 
Company will be held at 11.00 a.m. 
at The Honourable Artillery Company, 
Armoury House, City Road, London

Introduction 
The Board recognises the importance of 
high standards of corporate governance 
and is committed to managing the 
Group’s operations in accordance 
with the principles set out in the June 
2010 version of The UK Corporate 
Governance Code (the Code). The 
Company has complied with the Main 
Principles of the Code throughout the 
year. The Company has also complied 
with the Code Provisions set out in the 
Code throughout the year, except to the 
extent explained in this annual report.
The Board notes that a revised version  
of the Code was published in September 
2012 (which is expressed to apply to 
accounting periods beginning on or 
after 1 October 2012) and intends to 
comply with this version of the Code 
as it considers appropriate during the 
financial year ending 30 June 2014. 
Ian Lawson retired as a member of the 
Board with effect from 21 June 2013. 
For the remainder of the year, the Board 
comprised four executive directors 
and four independent non-executive 
directors, together with the chairman. 
The current executive directors are: 
Paul Sheffield (chief executive), Haydn 
Mursell (finance director) and Steve 
Bowcott (chief operating officer). The 
Board believes that its current structure 
is satisfactorily balanced, with the 
independent non-executive directors 
having a substantial presence in Board 
debate, constructively challenging the 
executive directors and assisting in the 
development of strategy.

Group’s reputation.
Board of directors 
The Board is responsible to 
shareholders for the success of 
the Company. The Board develops 
the Group’s strategy, monitors and 
reviews its business performance 
and controls risk. The Board has put 
in place reporting processes and 
other controls which are designed to 
ensure that it is provided with relevant 
information on a timely basis, which 
set authorisation limits and which 
reserve certain significant matters for 
the Board or its committees.
The Group’s chairman, who leads 
the Board, is Phil White. The 
chairman is responsible for the 
Board’s effectiveness and sets its 
agenda, ensuring that the directors 
receive accurate, timely and clear 
information. The chairman also 
facilitates the effective contribution 
of the non-executive directors and 
ensures a positive and constructive 
relationship between the executive 
and non-executive directors. The 
chairman is responsible for effective 
communication with shareholders 
and for ensuring that the directors 
continually update their skills and 
knowledge, and familiarity with the 
Group, in order to fulfil their roles.  
Phil White’s other significant 
commitments are his roles as 
chairman of The Unite Group plc and 
Lookers plc and as a non-executive 
director of Stagecoach Group plc  
and Vp plc.
The Group’s chief executive is  
Paul Sheffield, who is responsible 
for the operational management 
of the Group and is accountable to 
the Board for the implementation 
of the Group’s strategy. The chief 
executive meets regularly with the 
other executive directors (focusing 
on a variety of matters, including 
strategy, the Group’s cost base and 
overall efficiency, the integration of 
May Gurney, succession planning 
and other material issues facing 
the Group), the management of the 
Group’s businesses and the Group’s 
company secretary, human resources  
director and health and safety director.   Annual Report and Accounts 2013 —— 53   
The senior independent non-executive 
director is Chris Geoghegan. He is 
available to shareholders if they have 
concerns which contact through the 
normal channels of the chairman, the 
chief executive or the other executive 
directors has failed to resolve or for 
which such contact is inappropriate.  
In addition, the senior independent non-
executive director is responsible for the 
appraisal of the chairman’s performance. 
The Board considers Richard Bailey, 
Chris Geoghegan, Amanda Mellor and 
Nick Winser to be independent directors. 
The chairman of the Board, Phil White, 
was also considered to be independent 
on his appointment.
A table of attendance of directors 
at meetings of the Board and its 
committees is set out on page 56. 
Outside the formal schedule of meetings, 
the non-executive directors met without 
the executive directors during the year.
All directors have access to the advice 
and services of the company secretary 
and the directors are also able to seek 
independent professional advice, if 
necessary, at the Company’s expense. 
Training is available for new directors 
and subsequently as is considered 
necessary. All directors are subject 
to election by shareholders at the 
first annual general meeting following 
their appointment. Under the Articles, 
each director is subject to re-election 
thereafter at intervals of no more 
than three years. However, at the 
forthcoming annual general meeting 
of the Company, notwithstanding the 
provisions of the Articles, all of the 
directors will offer themselves for  
re-election in accordance with the 
Code. Executive directors are required 
to seek approval from the Board before 
accepting any external non-executive 
positions, although no such positions 
are currently held. 
The executive directors’ service 
agreements and the non-executive 
directors’ letters of appointment 
are available for inspection at the 
Company’s registered office and 
will be on display prior to and at the 
forthcoming annual general meeting.
Board performance evaluation  
During the year, the chairman, with the 
assistance of the company secretary, 
conducted a performance evaluation of 
the Board.
The aim of the evaluation process 
was to obtain open and constructive 
feedback that would:
>  provide an insight into the Board’s, 
and each individual director’s 
effectiveness;
>  assist to develop an action plan to 
ensure that the Board operates as 
effectively as possible; and
>  establish a benchmark for measuring 
future progress.
The feedback confirmed that the 
directors believed that the Board 
operated effectively, with meetings 
generally including constructive and 
challenging debate. A report comprising 
the feedback received was produced by 
the company secretary and, together 
with an action plan to ensure the 
continued effective performance of 
the Board, was tabled and discussed 
at the Board meeting held in August 
2013. A separate report relating to 
the performance of the chairman was 
also produced, with feedback being 
provided to the chairman by the senior 
independent non-executive director. 
The Board expects that its performance 
evaluation for the 2014 financial year 
will be externally facilitated.
In addition, throughout the year, the 
chairman of the Board held regular 
discussions with members of the 
Board and the company secretary to 
assess the performance of the Board, 
its committees and the individual 
directors. Actions arising from these 
discussions were implemented 
throughout the year. 
Members of the Risk Management and 
Audit Committee 
>   Richard Bailey (chair)
>  Chris Geoghegan
>   Amanda Mellor
>  Nick Winser
The Risk Management and Audit 
Committee comprises the non-executive 
directors. Richard Bailey, a chartered 
accountant with recent and relevant 
financial experience, is the chairman 
of the committee. The secretary of the 
committee is Hugh Raven.
The committee met four times during 
the year. These meetings were also 
attended by the Group finance director 
and the director responsible for internal 
audit. The KPMG audit engagement 
partner attended all of the meetings 
and met the chairman of the committee 
without management being present. 
The chairman of the Board is invited to 
attend the committee meetings and the 
executive directors attend when it is 
considered necessary or appropriate for 
them to do so.
The committee has clearly defined 
terms of reference which outline its 
objectives and responsibilities relating 
to financial reporting, internal controls, 
risk management and the application  
of appropriate accounting policies  
and procedures. 
The committee is responsible for 
monitoring and reviewing the Group’s 
internal audit function. The director 
responsible for internal audit meets the 
chairman of the committee to discuss the 
function and the Group’s internal controls.

Remuneration Committee
During the course of the year, PwC was 
engaged as an outsourced internal audit 
and assurance provider to deliver specific 
expertise, experience and resource 
alongside the internal audit function.
The committee is also responsible 
for monitoring and reviewing the 
performance, independence and 
objectivity of KPMG, the external auditor. 
The provision of non-audit services 
by KPMG over a predetermined cost 
threshold, other than tax compliance 
and routine taxation advice, must 
be referred to and agreed by the 
committee and any work costed below 
that threshold must be pre-approved 
by the Group finance director. These 
controls enable the committee to be 
satisfied that KPMG’s objectivity and 
independence as auditor has not been 
impaired, notwithstanding the provision 
of non-audit services in the year.
The fees paid to KPMG during the 
year in respect of non-audit services 
were £1,177,000 (2012: £85,500), 
of which £50,000 related to advice in 
connection with the potential disposal 
of a non-core IT asset, £183,000 to 
advice in connection with the Group’s 
organisational efficiency and cost base 
reduction project, £868,000 to due 
diligence and reporting accountants’ 
advice in connection with the 
acquisition of May Gurney, £45,000 
to the auditing of the Corporate 
Responsibility Annual Report and 
£31,000 to tax advice (and providing 
tax-related software licences). The 
audit fees for the year were £727,000. 
The total fees for non-audit services 
represented approximately 162% of 
the audit fees paid for the year (2012: 
11%). All figures exclude VAT.
In relation to the Group’s organisational 
efficiency and cost base reduction 
project, a further instalment of 
approximately £800,000 is currently 
estimated as being payable in the 2014 
financial year, together with a final 
instalment of approximately £350,000 
in the 2015 financial year. The total 
fees currently estimated to be payable 
to KPMG for their advice in respect of 
this project is, therefore, approximately 
£1.3m. 
Before engaging KPMG in relation to 
the project, the Board conducted a 
tender process comprising three firms 
of an appropriate size and having recent 
and relevant experience. The Board 
considered that KPMG were the most 
appropriate in light of the size and 
complexity of the Group’s business and 
operations, principally because of their 
recent and relevant experience (having 
conducted similar exercises within the 
construction sector) and the strength 
and depth of their resources.
Prior to the commencement of KPMG’s 
work, the Board agreed a process with 
KPMG to ensure that an appropriate 
ethical wall was established between 
the audit function and the consultancy 
team engaged on the project.
KPMG were also engaged to conduct 
due diligence on May Gurney and also 
to act as reporting accountants on the 
transaction. In light of the accelerated 
timetable and the significance of the 
transaction to the Group, the Board 
decided that it would be appropriate to 
engage KPMG for both exercises.
Before engaging KPMG with respect 
to the potential disposal of a non-core 
IT asset, the Board also conducted a 
tender process, involving three potential 
advisers. It was decided that it would 
be appropriate to select KPMG because 
of its combined corporate finance and 
IT expertise, together with the extent of 
its general resources. 
The committee acknowledges that the 
level of non-audit fees incurred during 
the year is significantly in excess of the 
audit fees for the year. The committee 
therefore wrote to, and met with, 
certain key shareholders to explain 
why it believed that it was appropriate 
to appoint KPMG with respect to the 
three projects described above. The 
committee will continue to liaise with 
shareholders to manage any concerns 
appropriately and to ensure the 
continued independence of the Group’s 
auditors. As part of the audit process 
for the year ended 30 June 2013, KPMG 
has confirmed that, with respect to this 
period, it was independent within the 
meaning of applicable regulatory and 
professional requirements. 
Matters considered by the Risk 
Management and Audit Committee 
during the year included: 
>   reviewing and recommending for 
approval by the Board the annual and 
interim financial statements;
>   agreeing the scope and reviewing the 
results of the external audit;
>   reviewing the effectiveness of the 
Group’ s internal controls and risk 
management processes;
>  approving the internal audit plan;
>   reviewing progress against the internal 
audit plan and the key findings of  
the audits;
>   planning the integration of May Gurney 
and its risk management processes 
within the Group;
>   monitoring the effectiveness of the 
internal audit function; and
>   agreeing the scope of KPMG’s audit, 
the level of remuneration paid to 
KPMG and the extent of KPMG’s 
non-audit services.
The committee notes the changes 
to its responsibilities and the Annual 
Report disclosure requirements which 
were introduced by the September 
2012 version of the Code and will 
take such changes into account 
(and those included in the Financial 
Reporting Council’s Guidance on Audit 
Committees (September 2012 version)) 
as it considers appropriate during the 
financial year ending 30 June 2014.
The committee’s terms of reference are 
available on the Company’s website and 
on request from the company secretary.

Details of the number of meetings  
of the full Board and its committees 
during the year are set out in the 
adjacent table. The table also sets out 
the number of Board meetings attended 
by each director and the number of 
committee meetings attended by each 
director as a member of the relevant 
committee during the year.
The executive directors are not 
members of the Board committees 
but are invited to attend meetings of 
these committees when it is considered 
necessary or appropriate for them 
to do so. For example, Paul Sheffield 
and Haydn Mursell attended the Risk 
Management and Audit Committee 
meetings in their respective capacities 
as chief executive and finance director 
and Paul Sheffield, Ian Lawson and 
Steve Bowcott attended both of the 
SHE Committee meetings.
Phil White is not a member of the Risk 
Management and Audit Committee but, 
as chairman of the Board, attended the 
committee’s meetings during the year. 
Risk management and internal controls 
The Code requires that the directors 
review the effectiveness of the Group’s 
risk management and internal control 
systems and that this review covers all 
material controls, including financial, 
operational and compliance controls. 
The Board has overall responsibility 
for the Group’s systems of risk 
management and internal control and 
for reviewing their effectiveness. As 
a result, the Board has put in place 
an ongoing process for identifying, 
evaluating and managing the significant 
risks faced by the Group. The Board 
considers that the Group’s systems and 
controls, which have been developed 
and refined over many years, are 
appropriately designed to ensure that 
the Group’s exposure to significant 
risks is properly managed. However, 
such systems are designed to manage 
rather than eliminate the risk of failure 
to achieve business objectives and 
can only provide reasonable and not

absolute assurance against material 
misstatement. In reviewing the 
effectiveness of internal controls, the 
directors have taken into account the 
Financial Reporting Council’s ‘Internal 
Control: Guidance for Directors’ 
(formerly known as The Turnbull 
Guidance) and have considered the 
key risks and exposures within the 
Group. The Group has entered into a 
number of joint ventures, which are not 
controlled by a member of the Group: 
these joint ventures are not included for 
the purposes of the assessment of the 
Group’s internal controls.
The Board receives regular reports 
relating to the Group’s operating units 
to monitor their performance and 
business unit management teams are 
briefed on relevant issues arising at 
Board meetings. 
During the course of a year, members 
of the Board visit a number of the 
Group’s significant business units and 
the Board also monitors the control 
framework of each business. The Risk 
Management and Audit Committee 
reviews the appropriateness and 
effectiveness of the Group’s internal 
controls and did not consider that any 
significant internal control failings or 
weaknesses were identified by the 
review conducted during the course  
of the year.
Relations with shareholders 
The Company has a programme of 
regular communication and meetings 
with investors, investment analysts 
and brokers. This includes detailed 
presentations to investors, analysts 
and the media when the Company 
announces its annual and interim 
results, together with additional 
engagement following the release of 
its interim management statements. 
This programme assists the Board 
to understand the views of major 
shareholders about the Group, 
its performance and its strategic 
objectives. Independent feedback is 
also provided to the Board by analysts 
and institutional shareholders.
The Board uses the annual general 
meeting to communicate directly with 
shareholders and encourages their 
attendance at this event, where the 
chairmen of the Board’s committees 
are present to answer questions. The 
chairman of the Board also meets 
regularly with individual shareholders 
to obtain their views on a variety of 
matters, as does the chairman of the 
Remuneration Committee in relation  
to remuneration matters.
The Board invites investors, brokers 
and analysts to visit the Group’s 
projects so as to demonstrate the 
scope and scale of its activities. These 
site visits also include a series of 
presentations by members of the Board 
and members of senior management 
about the Group’s operations.
The Group also regularly engages with 
a range of shareholders in relation 
to its corporate responsibility (CR) 
programme. During the year, it also 
liaised with a number of shareholders 
in relation to environmental, social 
and governance (ESG) issues including 
questions arising from the FTSE4 Good 
ESG ratings. The Group has continued 
to engage proactively with the ESG 
or responsible investment executives 
of a number of major institutional 
investors to seek their feedback on its 
CR reporting. As part of this process, 
the Group has again engaged KPMG 
to provide independent assurance for 
its 2013 CR Annual Report and is now 
reporting against the Global Reporting 
Initiative (GRI) standard C+.
The Group’s website, which,  
during the year, was updated and 
re-branded, plays a significant role 
in its communication with investors, 
customers, its supply chain, the media 
and the general public. In addition, the 
Group also communicates via a range 
of social media tools, including Twitter 
and YouTube. For example, during 
the year, the chief executive delivers 
various trading updates via video 
announcements which also feature 
on the Group’s YouTube site and have 
alerts and links via Twitter.

Directors’ 
remuneration 
report
Introduction 
This report has been prepared by 
the Remuneration Committee (the 
Committee) on behalf of the Board.  
This report complies with the Companies 
Act 2006, Schedule 8 of the Large and 
Medium sized Companies and Groups 
(Accounts and Reports) Regulations 
2008 and the Listing Rules.
In addition, the Company has chosen 
to comply with certain of the disclosure 
requirements of the Large and Medium-
sized Companies and Groups (Accounts 
and Reports) (Amendment) Regulations 
2012 (the New Regulations), although 
the New Regulations do not apply 
formally to the Company until the year 
ending 30 June 2014.
Shareholder consultation 
During the year, a number of significant 
changes have occurred within the 
business, including:
>  in April 2013, the announcement 
of a recommended offer for May 
Gurney, the completion of which 
took place on 8 July 2013. During 
the discussions with management 
relating to the acquisition, 
shareholders indicated that it would 
be appropriate for the Committee 
to carry out a comprehensive review 
of executive remuneration at Kier, 
particularly in light of the size and 
nature of the enlarged Group; and 
>  on 21 June 2013, the 
announcement of a number of 
changes to the Board, resulting in  
a revised structure which comprises 
three executive directors (previously, 
four) with increased responsibilities. 
With effect from that date, Ian 
Lawson retired from the Board, 
further details of which are provided 
later in this report. 
The principal changes to the Board 
made in June 2013 were:
>  the introduction of the role of chief 
operating officer: Steve Bowcott has 
taken up this role, with operational 
responsibility for the construction 
and services businesses. The 
creation of this position will 
enable Kier to implement common 
processes and efficiencies across 
the Group; and 
>  Haydn Mursell assumed operational 
responsibility for the Property 
division, in addition to his current 
responsibilities as finance director. 
The Committee reviewed the executive 
directors’ overall remuneration to 
ensure that it remains in line with 
the Group’s remuneration policy and 
continues to support sustainable 
long-term value for shareholders. As 
part of the review, the Committee 
incorporated feedback received from 
its extensive consultation with the 
Company’s significant shareholders 
on its proposed changes. Although 
the Committee acknowledges that 
shareholders may have differing views 
on remuneration matters, it was 
pleased to have received the support 
of the majority of the shareholders 
consulted. 
2014 remuneration 
The principal changes resulting from this 
consultation process, to be effective in 
the financial year ending 30 June 2014, 
are as follows:
>  Haydn Mursell and Steve Bowcott 
have both received salary increases 
commensurate with the significant 
increase in their responsibilities 
which resulted from both the 
acquisition of May Gurney and the 
restructuring of the Board described 
above; 
>  the Committee considered it 
appropriate to phase the increases 
for Haydn Mursell and Steve 
Bowcott over two years, with both 
directors receiving 10% increases 
(to £378,000) with effect from  
1 July 2013 and, subject to 
continued satisfactory performance,  
a further 6.5% (to £402,000), plus 
the average of any salary increases 
across the Group, with effect from  
1 July 2014;
>  awards to the executive directors 
under the Group’s long-term 
incentive plan in the year will be 
increased from 100% of salary 
to 150%, with the additional 50% 
opportunity relating to the return 
on capital employed by May Gurney; 
and
>  all executive directors will 
be encouraged to maintain 
shareholdings with a value of at 
least two times salary (currently, 
one times). 
The maximum annual bonus opportunity 
will remain at 100% for the financial 
year ending 30 June 2014.
The Remuneration Committee 
The Committee comprises the non-
executive directors. The secretary of 
the Committee is Hugh Raven. 
The Committee met five times during 
the year. Further details of the 
Committee are set out on pages 54 
and 55.
The key responsibilities of the 
Committee include:
>  making recommendations to the 
Board on its executive remuneration 
policy;
>  determining specific remuneration 
packages for each of the executive 
directors on behalf of the Board; 
and
>  monitoring the remuneration 
packages of other senior members 
of management within the Group.
In undertaking these responsibilities, the 
Committee seeks independent external 
advice, as is considered necessary. 
During the year, the Committee was 
advised by its independent remuneration 
advisers, Kepler Associates (Kepler). 
Kepler provides no other advice, or 
services, to the Company. Kepler is a 
signatory to the Code of Conduct for 
Remuneration Consultants which has 
been developed by the Remuneration 
Consultants Group. 
The Committee also seeks internal 
support and advice from the company 
secretary and the Group’s human 
resources director. The Committee 
consults the chief executive concerning 
its proposals. No individual participates 
in any discussion regarding his or her 
own remuneration.
Remuneration policy 
The Committee’s key objective is to 
ensure executive remuneration is 
aligned with shareholders’ interests, 
taking into account the need to:
>  attract, retain and motivate  
talent, but at a reasonable  
cost to the Group; 
>  maintain an appropriate balance 
between fixed elements of 
remuneration (basic salary, 
benefits in kind and pension) and 
performance-related elements of 
remuneration (annual bonus and 
long-term incentives); and Annual Report and Accounts 2013 —— 59   
>  place an increasing emphasis on 
rewarding executives by reference to 
the Group’s long-term performance by 
incentivising sustainable profit growth 
and the creation of long-term value.
The Committee reviews the executive 
directors’ remuneration on an annual 
basis. At each review, the Committee 
considers an individual’s experience 
and performance in their role over 
the year against a number of key 
performance indicators relating to both 
individual and corporate measures 
of performance. The individual’s 
experience and performance are 
then considered against the market 
positioning of pay for the role, based on 
an analysis of external reference points 
provided by the Group’s independent 
remuneration advisers. 
The Committee also takes into account 
pay and employment conditions 
across senior management within the 
Group when determining the executive 
directors’ remuneration.
The executive directors’ remuneration 
comprises: 
>  a basic salary; 
>  an annual bonus; 
>  awards under long-term incentive 
plans;
> pension-related benefits; and 
>  benefits in kind. 
Further information on each of the 
elements is set out below.
The non-executive directors’ 
remuneration is determined by the 
Board and reflects the anticipated 
time commitment to fulfil their duties. 
Non-executive directors do not receive 
bonuses, long-term incentive awards, 
pension provision or compensation on 
termination of their appointments. 
Basic salary 
The Committee determined that, with 
effect from 1 July 2013, the executive 
directors’ basic salaries would increase 
as follows: 
From  
1 July 
2013 
£000
From  
1 July 
2012 
£000
%  
increase
Steve Bowcott 378 343 10
Haydn Mursell 378 343 10
Paul Sheffield 481 469 2.5
The increases for Steve Bowcott and  
Haydn Mursell are described in further 
detail on page 58. Paul Sheffield’s 
increase is within the range of increases 
awarded to employees across the Group.
It was also decided that the fees 
payable to the non-executive directors 
would increase with effect from 1 July 
2013, as follows: 
From  
1 July 
2013

Annual bonus arrangements 
During the year ended 30 June 2013, 
executive directors were eligible to 
receive a cash bonus of up to 100% 
of basic salary. Of this, a maximum 
of 60% was payable if the Group 
achieved certain profit performance 
targets and a maximum of 25% was 
payable if the Group also achieved 
certain cash performance targets. 
The remaining 15% was payable if 
corporate responsibility and health 
and safety performance targets, which 
are considered to be key non-financial 
measures for the Group, were achieved. 
The Group’s reported profit before 
exceptional items and tax for the year 
exceeded budget and the Group also 
achieved its corporate responsibility 
target. The Committee therefore 
determined that a bonus of 48.8% of 
basic salary would be payable to each 
of the executive directors during the 
year, with 41.3% of basic salary being 
payable with respect to the Group’s 
profit performance and 7.5% relating 
to the corporate responsibility target. 
The Committee was satisfied that this 
bonus was commensurate with the 
Group’s overall performance for the 
year. Further details of these payments 
are set out in the table on page 63.
One-third of any annual bonus awarded 
to the executive directors is satisfied 
by Kier Group plc shares and is subject 
to clawback in certain circumstances. 
A similar approach is applied to 
the annual bonus arrangements for 
members of the senior management 
team. The Committee believes that 
part satisfaction of the annual bonus 
in shares further strengthens the 
alignment of interests of the executive 
directors, and of the divisional directors, 
with those of shareholders.
The executive directors will continue to 
be entitled to receive a cash bonus of 
up to 100% of basic salary in respect of 
the financial year ending 30 June 2014, 
of which one-third will be satisfied in 
shares. The Committee determined that 
the following performance measures 
would apply to the 2014 annual bonus:
> Profit: 55%
> Cash: 25%
> Kier’s safety performance: 5%
>  May Gurney’s safety performance: 
5%
> Individual objectives: 10%
The percentages referred to above are 
the maximum opportunities for each of 
the measures. The individual objectives 
will include objectives relating to the 
successful integration of May Gurney 
and the progress of the Group’s 
organisational efficiency and cost base 
reduction project.

Long-term incentives  
The Company operates a long-term 
incentive plan, which was approved 
by shareholders at the 2010 annual 
general meeting (the LTIP). 
Contingent awards under the LTIP  
of 100% of salary were made to Paul 
Sheffield, Steve Bowcott and Ian 
Lawson on 14 September 2012.  
An award of 200% of salary was made 
to Haydn Mursell on the same date. 
With respect to the award to Haydn 
Mursell, the Committee consulted 
with, and took into account feedback 
received from, a wide range of the 
Group’s institutional investors and 
shareholder representative bodies.  
A range of awards were also made to the 
senior management team and other key 
employees, so as to further strengthen 
alignment with shareholders’ interests.
For each new award cycle, the 
Committee sets performance targets 
which it considers to be stretching 
but achievable, using both external 
reference points (for example, brokers’ 
earnings forecasts) and internal 
forecasts. 
The awards made on 14 September 
2012 are subject to the satisfaction of 
performance criteria which relate to the 
Group’s earnings per share (EPS) and 
total shareholder return (TSR) over a 
three-year period ending 30 June 2015. 
Two-thirds of these awards relate to 
TSR performance; one-third relates to 
EPS performance. Further details are 
provided below.
The awards to be made during the year 
ending 30 June 2014 will relate to TSR 
performance, EPS growth and return 
on capital employed by May Gurney 
(with equal weightings for each of the 
three elements). A further description 
of these performance conditions will be 
included in next year’s Annual Report.
If TSR performance is in line with 
the weighted index, 25% of the TSR 
element of the awards will vest and 
100% of the TSR element will vest for 
12% per annum outperformance of 
the weighted index or higher. Awards 
will vest on a straight-line basis for 
performance between these two points. 
At the date of the awards, 12% per 
annum outperformance of the weighted 
index was consistent with levels of 
historical levels of upper quintile 
performance.
EPS  
The Committee believes that EPS is a 
key measure of long-term performance 
for the Group and that measuring EPS 
targets on a cumulative basis provides 
robust performance targets. By way 
of illustration, compound cumulative 
EPS growth of 15% over a three-year 
performance period against a previous 
year EPS of 100p would be achieved 
if compound cumulative EPS over the 
performance period is at least 399p. 
None of the EPS element of the awards 
made on 14 September 2012 will vest 
if the Group’s compound cumulative 
EPS growth over the performance 
period is less than 5% per annum, 
25% of the EPS element will vest for 
compound cumulative EPS growth 
of 5% per annum and 100% will vest 
for compound cumulative EPS growth 
of 15% per annum or higher. Awards 
will vest on a straight-line basis for 
compound cumulative EPS growth 
between these two points.
TSR  
TSR outperformance is measured on a 
multiplicative basis relative to a revenue 
weighted index based on the FTSE ASX 
Construction index and the FTSE ASX 
Support Services index. For each award 
cycle, the revenue weightings are fixed 
based on the Group’s approximate prior 
year revenue mix. Such a weighted index 
is intended to provide a better reflection 
of the Group’s overall business mix and 
therefore provide a more robust measure 
of management’s contribution to long-
term value creation. For the awards 
made on 14 September 2012, these 
weightings were 75% on the Construction 
index and 25% on the Support Services 
index. For example, over the three-year 
period, if Construction index TSR is 16% 
and Support Services index TSR is 12%, 
the Group’s TSR will need to be at least 
15% ((75% x 16%) + (25% x 12%)) for 
this element of the LTIP award to vest.

  Ian Lawson retired from the Board with effect from 21 June 2013. His 2011 award remained unaffected but the maximum numbers of ordinary shares in the 
Company receivable under his 2012 and 2013 awards were reduced from 27,113 to 18,075 and from 28,029 to 9,343 to reflect his active service with the 
Group during the relevant performance periods. As at the date of this document, the cumulative total maximum number of shares receivable by Ian Lawson 
under LTIP awards (including the 2011 award) is 56,714. 
 
The performance criteria relating to the awards are set out on page 60. The TSR and EPS elements of the 2011 award are 
weighted equally and, in the case of the 2012 and 2013 awards, are weighted two-thirds:one-third.
Compound cumulative growth in EPS over the performance period which ended on 30 June 2013 and the Group’s TSR 
outperformance (each as described on page 60) during the six-month averaging period which ended on the same date 
resulted in the EPS and TSR elements of the 2011 award vesting as to 30.17% and 32.12%, respectively, or an aggregate 
vesting of 31.15% of the award. 
On 14 November 2013 (being the vesting date for the 2011 award), those persons who served as a director during the year 
ended 30 June 2013 will be entitled to the following number of ordinary shares in the capital of the Company as a result of 
the vesting of the 2011 award (subject to deductions to satisfy income tax and national insurance contributions which will 
be due):
Number of ordinary shares
Steve Bowcott 7,543
Ian Lawson 9,125
Haydn Mursell 7,543
Paul Sheffield 10,464
Richard Simkin, a former member of the Board, will be entitled to received 2,673 ordinary shares in the capital of the 
Company as a result of the vesting of the 2011 award (subject to deductions to satisfy income tax and national insurance 
contributions). As described in last year’s Annual Report, his 2011 award was pro rated to a maximum of 8,583 shares to 
reflect the length of his active service during the performance period for the award.

Directors’ pensions 
Executive directors participate in the Kier Group Pension Scheme (the Pension Scheme) which has both a defined benefit 
section and a defined contribution section. 
Executive directors accrue pension up to the value of the lifetime allowance. Where the value of pension benefits exceeds 
the lifetime allowance, future pension accrual ceases and a cash supplement is paid. Following changes to the taxation of 
UK pensions and, in particular, the reduction in the annual allowance, the trustees of the Pension Scheme and the Company 
have agreed that an executive director’s annual pension provision may be replaced partly by a cash supplement. 
The level of cash supplement is 20% of that salary which is no longer pensionable (or, in the case of Ian Lawson, 30%,  
as the cost of his current membership of the pension scheme was higher than for the other directors). The Committee has 
determined the level of cash supplement for each individual with a view to maintaining the Group’s pension-related costs 
at their current level. An assessment has been carried out by the Pension Scheme’s actuary of the cost to the Group of the 
current benefit provision and the individual supplements have been set at levels which are commensurate with the value of 
the pension benefit foregone. The Committee believes that the levels of supplement are in line with market practice.
Only the basic salary of directors is pensionable. Any cash supplement is excluded in determining annual bonus and  
long-term incentive entitlements.
Pension benefits earned by those persons who served as a director during the year ended 30 June 2013 and are members 
of the defined benefit section of the Pension Scheme are as follows:

Retirement from the Board – principal terms 
Ian Lawson retired from the Board with effect from 21 June 2013, remaining employed by the Group until 21 September 
2013 to assist with the integration of May Gurney. The Committee agreed that Ian would be entitled to his salary (and cash 
supplement relating to his pension) for his 12-month contractual notice period, the first half of which will be paid in monthly 
instalments until March 2014 and, in April 2014, a lump sum will be paid with respect to the six-month period ending 
September 2014. The total amount payable with respect to the notice period is £510,510, although all payments during 
the notice period are subject to a right of clawback in favour of the Company to the extent that additional remuneration is 
obtained during the period. In addition, it was agreed that £8,100 would be paid by way of statutory redundancy entitlement. 
No other benefits will be payable during his notice period. In light of Ian’s long service with the Group (in aggregate, 
approximately 20 years), the Committee exercised its discretion to allow his 2012 and 2013 LTIP awards to remain 
outstanding, subject to a reduction to reflect his active service with the Group during the relevant performance periods. 
Since Ian had been in active service for the whole of the performance period relating to the 2011 award, the Committee 
allowed his original award to remain in place, without adjustment. The Committee also agreed that, since Ian had been in 
active service for the year ended 30 June 2013, he would be entitled to a bonus with respect to the year, further details of 
which are set out on page 63.
Service contracts and letters of appointment 
The effective date of the service agreement or letter of appointment of each director of the Company at 30 June 2013 and 
the applicable notice periods are as follows:
Effective date Notice period
Richard Bailey 1 October 2010 1 month
Steve Bowcott 1 July 2010 12 months

  Phil White assumed the role of chairman with effect from 2 January 2008.
 
No term is included in any of the executive directors’ service agreements or the non-executive directors’ letters of 
appointment. Notice may be served by either party to the service agreement or letter of appointment. However, each director 
is subject to re-election, in accordance with the Articles, further details of which are set out on page 50.
The executive directors’ service agreements do not contain any provisions for compensation for loss of office. These service 
agreements contain provisions relating to early termination and, in such cases, the Committee will consider the specific 
circumstances, the Company’s commitments under the service agreement and any obligation to mitigate.
The Committee believes that its policy in relation to notice periods and early termination payments under the directors’ 
contracts is fair and reasonable in the interests of the Group and the individual concerned.
As indicated above, the Company has entered into letters of appointment with each of the non-executive directors. The 
letters of appointment do not include any provisions for the payment of predetermined compensation in the case of wrongful 
termination by the Company.
Directors’ interests 
The directors of the Company at 30 June 2013 had the following beneficial interests (including interests of connected 
persons) in the ordinary shares of the Company:
 30 June 2013 1 July 2012 
Richard Bailey – –
Steve Bowcott 12,310 4,537
Chris Geoghegan 5,000 5,000

Phil White 2,540 2,540
Nick Winser 3,500 3,500 Annual Report and Accounts 2013 —— 65   
The preceding table includes, where relevant, matching shares purchased, at no cost to the individual, on their behalf under 
the AESOP and shares to which the executive directors are beneficially entitled as a result of receiving one-third of their 
2011 and 2012 bonuses in shares. The table does not include shares to which the executive directors will become entitled 
upon the vesting of the awards under the LTIP granted on 15 November 2010 and/or any shares to which the executive 
directors may, in the future, become entitled upon the vesting of other awards granted under the LTIP. 
The executive directors, as potential beneficiaries of the Kier Group 1999 Employee Benefit Trust (the Trust), are deemed 
along with certain other UK employees to have an interest in 485,081 ordinary shares (2012: 612,489), with an aggregate 
nominal value of £4,851 (2012: £6,125), held by the Trust, representing approximately 0.9% of the issued share capital of 
the Company as at 11 September 2013.
At 11 September 2013, the Company had been notified that the following current directors had acquired beneficial interests 
in further ordinary shares in the capital of the Company under the AESOP since 30 June 2013: Steve Bowcott, 26 shares; 
and Haydn Mursell, 25 shares. There have been no other changes in the interests of the directors (or their connected 
persons) in the ordinary shares in the capital of the Company since 30 June 2013.
Shareholding guidelines 
The Committee encourages executive directors to build up a shareholding in the Company. With effect from 1 July 2014, 
the Committee has increased the recommended level of shareholding from at least one year’s salary to at least two years’ 
salary, over a period of up to five years. Executive directors are therefore encouraged to retain any shares allocated to them 
as part of the annual bonus arrangements and 50% of the shares allocated to them upon the vesting of LTIP awards (net of 
tax) until this shareholding has been reached.
The Sharesave Scheme 
The Sharesave Scheme is a save as you earn option scheme, approved by HM Revenue & Customs under Schedule 3 of the 
Income Tax (Earnings and Pensions) Act 2003. All eligible employees and executive directors are entitled to participate in 
the Sharesave Scheme. Performance conditions do not apply. There has been no variation of the terms and conditions of 
such options.
The directors of the Company at 30 June 2013 had the following options under the Sharesave Scheme:

Total employee expenditure for the years ended 30 June 2012 and 2013 is explained in note 6 to the Group’s financial 
statements for such years. The figures included above exclude related social security costs.
The interim and final dividends for the year ended 30 June 2012 were 21.5p and 44.5p per share, respectively. The interim 
and final (proposed) dividends for the year ended 30 June 2013 are 21.5p and 46.5p per share, respectively. The increase 
in dividend expenditure in the year ended 30 June 2013 arose principally because of the increase in the Company’s issued 
share capital which resulted from the issue of 14,714,445 shares in connection with the acquisition of May Gurney.

Governance
Statement  
of directors’ 
responsibilities
The directors are responsible for 
preparing the annual report and the 
Group and parent company financial 
statements in accordance with 
applicable law and regulations.
Company law requires the directors to 
prepare the Group and parent company 
financial statements for each financial 
year. Under that law, they are required to 
prepare the Group financial statements 
in accordance with International 
Financial Reporting Standards as 
adopted by the EU (IFRS) and applicable 
law and have elected to prepare the 
parent company financial statements 
in accordance with UK Accounting 
Standards and applicable law (UK 
Generally Accepted Accounting Practice).
Under company law, the directors must 
not approve the financial statements 
unless they are satisfied that they 
give a true and fair view of the state 
of affairs of the Group and parent 
company and of their profit or loss for 
that period.
In preparing each of the Group and 
parent company financial statements, 
the directors are required to:
>  select suitable accounting policies 
and then apply them consistently;
>  make judgements and estimates that 
are reasonable and prudent;
>  for the Group financial statements, 
state whether they have been 
prepared in accordance with IFRS,  
as adopted by the EU;
>  for the parent company financial 
statements, state whether applicable 
UK Accounting Standards have been 
followed, subject to any material 
departures disclosed and explained 
in the parent company financial 
statements; and
>  prepare the financial statements on 
the going concern basis unless it is 
inappropriate to presume that the 
Group and the parent company will 
continue in business.
The directors are responsible for 
keeping adequate accounting records 
that are sufficient to show and explain 
the parent company’s transactions and 
disclose with reasonable accuracy at 
any time the financial position of the 
parent company and enable them to 
ensure that its financial statements 
comply with the Companies Act 2006. 
They have general responsibility for 
taking such steps as are reasonably 
open to them to safeguard the assets 
of the Group and to prevent and detect 
fraud and other irregularities.
Under applicable law and regulations, 
the directors are also responsible for 
preparing a directors’ report, a directors’ 
remuneration report and a corporate 
governance statement that comply with 
that law and those regulations.
The directors are responsible for 
the maintenance and integrity of the 
corporate and financial information 
included on the Company’s website. 
Legislation in the UK governing the 
preparation and dissemination of 
financial statements may differ from 
legislation in other jurisdictions.
Directors’ responsibility statement 
We confirm that to the best of our 
knowledge:
>  the financial statements, prepared in 
accordance with the applicable set 
of accounting standards, give a true 
and fair view of the assets, liabilities, 
financial position and profit or loss of 
the Company and the undertakings 
included in the consolidation as a 
whole; and
>  the operating and financial review, 
which forms part of the directors’ 
report, includes a fair review of the 
development and performance of 
the business and the position of 
the Company and the undertakings 
included in the consolidation  
taken as a whole, together with  
a description of the principal risks 
and uncertainties that they face.

in the preparation of the parent company financial statements 
is applicable law and UK Accounting Standards (UK Generally

state to them in an auditor’s report and for no other purpose. To 
the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume 
responsibility to anyone other than the company and the company’s 
members, as a body, for our audit work, for this report, or for the 
opinions we have formed.
Respective responsibilities of directors and auditor 
As explained more fully in the Directors’ Responsibilities Statement 
set out on page 68, the directors are responsible for the preparation 
of the financial statements and for being satisfied that they give 
a true and fair view. Our responsibility is to audit, and express an 
opinion on, the financial statements in accordance with applicable 
law and International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland). Those 
standards require us to comply with the Auditing Practices Board’s 
(APB’s) Ethical Standards for Auditors.
Scope of the audit of the financial statements  
A description of the scope of an audit of financial statements  
is provided on the Financial Reporting Council’s website at  
www.frc.org.uk/auditscopeukprivate. 
In our opinion:
>  the financial statements give a true and fair view of the state of 
the group’s and of the parent company’s affairs as at 30 June 
2013 and of the group’s profit for the year then ended;
>  the group financial statements have been properly prepared in 
accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the EU;

In our opinion:
>  the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited has 
been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 
2006; 
>  the information given in the Directors’ Report for the financial 
year for which the financial statements are prepared is consistent 
with the financial statements; and
>  the information given in the Corporate Governance Statement set 
out on pages 52 to 57 with respect to internal control and risk 
management systems in relation to financial reporting processes 
and about share capital structures is consistent with the financial 
statements.
Matters on which we are required to report by exception 
We have nothing to report in respect of the following:
Under the Companies Act 2006 we are required to report to you if, 
in our opinion:
>  adequate accounting records have not been kept by the parent 
company, or returns adequate for our audit have not been 
received from branches not visited by us; or
>  the parent company financial statements and the part of 
the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited are not in 
agreement with the accounting records and returns; or
>  certain disclosures of directors’ remuneration specified by law 
are not made; or
>  we have not received all the information and explanations we 
require for our audit; or
>  a Corporate Governance Statement has not been prepared by the 
company.
Under the Listing Rules we are required to review:
>  the directors’ statement, set out on page 48, in relation to going 
concern; 
>  the part of the Corporate Governance Statement on page 52 
relating to the company’s compliance with the nine provisions of 
the UK Corporate Governance Code specified for our review; and
>  certain elements of the report to shareholders by the Board on 
directors’ remuneration.

Consolidated cash flow
statement
For the year ended 30 June 2013
Overview Operational review Corporate responsibility Financial review Governance Financial statements Kier Group plc (the Company) is a company domiciled in the United
Kingdom (UK). The consolidated financial statements of the Company
for the year ended 30 June 2013 comprise the Company and its
subsidiaries (together referred to as the Group) and the Group’s
interest in jointly controlled entities.
The consolidated financial statements were approved by the directors
on 11 September 2013.
Statement of compliance
The Group’s consolidated financial statements have been prepared
and approved by the directors in accordance with International
Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the EU (IFRS). The
Company has elected to prepare its parent company financial
statements in accordance with UK Generally Accepted Accounting
Practice (GAAP). These are presented on pages 107 to 110.
Basis of preparation
The Group has considerable financial resources, long-term contracts
and a diverse range of customers and suppliers across its business
activities.
After making enquiries, the directors have a reasonable expectation
that the Company and the Group have adequate resources to continue
in operational existence for the foreseeable future. Accordingly, the
directors continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the
Group’s financial statements.
The following accounting policies have been applied consistently in
dealing with items which are considered material in relation to the
Group’s financial statements.
The financial statements are presented in pounds sterling. They have
been prepared on the historical cost basis except for derivative financial
instruments which are stated at their fair value, certain inventories that
are valued at net realisable value and certain payables on extended
terms which are stated at discounted cost.
The following amendments to standards or interpretations are effective
for the first time for the financial year ended 30 June 2013:
Amendments to IAS 1 Presentation of Financial Statements
The adoption of this amendment has not resulted in changes to the
Group’s accounting policies and has not had a material impact on
amounts reported for the current or prior years.
The following new standards, amendments to standards and
interpretations have been issued, but are not effective for the financial
year ended 30 June 2013:
Effective for periods for Kier Group plc for financial years beginning on
or after 1 July 2013
IFRS 13 Fair Value Measurement
IFRIC 20 Stripping costs in the production phase in a surface mine
IAS 19R Employee Benefits
Amendments to IFRS 7 Financial Instruments: Disclosures (Offsetting
financial assets and financial liabilities)
IAS 32 Financial Instruments: Presentation (Offsetting financial
assets and financial liabilities)
Effective for periods for Kier Group plc for financial years beginning on
or after 1 July 2014
IFRS 10 Consolidated Financial statements
IFRS 11 Joint Arrangements
IFRS 12 Disclosure of Interests in Other Entities
IAS 27 Consolidated and Separate Financial Statements
IAS 28 Investments in Associates and Joint Ventures
IAS 36 Impairment of Assets (recoverable amount disclosures for
non-financial assets)
Effective date currently un-determined as not endorsed yet by the EU.
IFRS 9 Financial Instruments
The directors have considered the impact of these new standards and
interpretations in future periods. The impact of the adoption of IAS 19R
which is effective for the year ending 30 June 2014 is to replace the
credit for the expected return on scheme assets and the charge for the
interest cost on scheme liabilities in the income statement with an
interest charge on the net pension deficit. If this new standard had
been implemented for the year ended 30 June 2013 the pension
charge in the income statement would have increased by £16.7m with
a matching credit direct to reserves. This change has no impact on the
pension deficit or cash.
Other than the impact of IAS 19R as noted above, no significant net
impact from the adoption of these new standards is expected. The
Group has chosen not to adopt any of the above standards and
interpretations earlier than required.
Basis of consolidation
(a) Subsidiaries
The consolidated financial statements comprise the financial
statements of the Company and subsidiaries controlled by the
Company drawn up to 30 June 2013. Control exists when the Group
has direct or indirect power to govern the financial and operating
policies of an entity so as to obtain economic benefits from its
activities. Subsidiaries are included in the consolidated financial
statements from the date that control transfers to the Group until the
date that control ceases.
Business combinations are accounted for using the acquisition method
as at the acquisition date, which is the date on which control is
transferred to the Group. Control is the power to govern the financial
and operating policies of an entity so as to obtain benefits from its
activities. In assessing control, the Group takes into consideration
potential voting rights that currently are exercisable.
For acquisitions on or after 1 January 2010, the Group measures
goodwill at the acquisition date as:
• the fair value of the consideration transferred; plus 
• the recognised amount of any non-controlling interests in the
acquiree; plus
• if the business combination is achieved in stages, the fair value of
the existing equity interest in the acquiree; less
• the net recognised amount (generally fair value) of the identifiable
assets acquired and liabilities assumed.
When the result is negative, a ‘bargain purchase’ gain is recognised
immediately in profit or loss. 
The consideration transferred does not include amounts related to the
settlement of pre-existing relationships. Such amounts are generally
recognised in profit or loss. Costs related to the acquisition, other than
those associated with the issue of debt or equity securities, that the
Group incurs in connection with a business combination are expensed
as incurred. Any contingent consideration payable is recognised at fair
value at the acquisition date. Subsequent changes to the fair value of
the contingent consideration are recognised in the income statement
unless the contingent consideration is classified as equity, in which
case settlement is accounted for within reserves.

Notes to the

statements
For the year ended 30 June 2013
1 Significant accounting policies (b) Joint ventures
A joint venture is a contractual arrangement whereby the Group
undertakes an economic activity that is subject to joint control with
third parties.
The Group’s interests in jointly controlled entities are accounted for
using the equity method. Under this method the Group’s share of the
profits less losses of jointly controlled entities is included in the
consolidated income statement and its interest in their net assets is
included in investments in the consolidated balance sheet. Where the
share of losses exceeds the Group’s interest in the entity and there is
no obligation to fund these losses the carrying amount is reduced to nil
following which no further losses are recognised. Interest in the entity
is the carrying amount of the investment together with any long-term
interests that, in substance, form part of the net investment in the
entity.
Where a Group company is party to a jointly controlled operation, that
company accounts for the assets it controls, the liabilities and
expenses it incurs and its share of the income. Such joint
arrangements are reported in the consolidated financial statements on
the same basis.
Goodwill and other intangible assets
Goodwill arising on consolidation represents the excess of the
consideration over the Group’s interest in the fair value of the
identifiable assets and liabilities of a subsidiary or jointly controlled
entity at the date of acquisition.
Goodwill is recognised as an asset and reviewed for impairment at
least annually. Any impairment is recognised immediately in the
income statement and is not subsequently reversed. Negative goodwill
is recognised in the income statement immediately. On disposal of a
subsidiary or jointly controlled entity, the attributable carrying amount
of goodwill is included in the determination of the profit or loss on
disposal.
Goodwill arising on acquisitions before 1 July 2004, being the date of
transition to IFRS, has been retained at the previous UK GAAP value at
1 July 2004 subject to being tested for impairment. Goodwill written off
to reserves under UK GAAP prior to 1998 has not been reinstated and
is not included in determining any subsequent profit or loss on
disposal.
Other intangible assets which comprise contract rights and computer
software are stated at cost less accumulated amortisation and
impairment losses. Amortisation is charged to cost of sales in the
income statement on a straight-line basis over the expected useful
lives of the assets.
Exceptional items
Items which are significant by their size and nature require separate
disclosure and are reported separately in the income statement in the
column headed ‘Exceptional items and amortisation’.
Revenue and profit recognition
Revenue comprises the fair value of the consideration received or
receivable, net of value added tax, rebates and discounts and after
eliminating sales within the Group. It also includes the Group’s
proportion of work carried out under jointly controlled operations.
Revenue and profit are recognised as follows:
(a) Construction contracts
Revenue arises from increases in valuations on contracts and is
normally determined by external valuations. It is the gross value of
work carried out for the period to the balance sheet date (including
retentions) but excludes claims until they are actually certified.
Profit on contracts is calculated in accordance with accounting
standards and industry practice. Industry practice is to assess the
estimated final outcome of each contract and recognise the profit
based upon the percentage of completion of the contract at the
relevant date. The assessment of the final outcome of each contract is
determined by, regular review of the revenues and costs to complete
that contract. Consistent contract review procedures are in place in
respect of contract forecasting.
The general principles for profit recognition are as follows:
• profits on short duration contracts (generally less than 12 months)
are taken when the contract is complete;
• profits on other contracts are recognised on a percentage of
completion basis when the contract’s outcome can be estimated
reliably;
• provision is made for losses incurred or foreseen in bringing the
contract to completion as soon as they become apparent;
• claims receivable are recognised as income when received or
certified for payment, except that in preparing contract forecasts to
completion, a prudent and reasonable evaluation of claims
receivable may be included to mitigate foreseeable losses and only
to the extent that there is reasonable certainty of recovery; and
• variations and compensation events are included in forecasts to
completion when it is considered highly probable that they will be
recovered.
Percentage completion is normally calculated by taking certified value
to date as a percentage of estimated final value, unless the internal
value is materially different to the certified value, in which case the
internal value is used.
(b) Services
Revenue and profit from services rendered, which include facilities
management, maintenance, street cleaning and recycling, is
recognised as and when the service is provided.
(c) Private housing and land sales
Revenue from housing sales is recognised at the fair value of the
consideration received or receivable on legal completion, net of
incentives. Revenue from land sales and land exchanges is recognised
on the unconditional exchange of contracts. Profit is recognised on a
site-by-site basis by reference to the expected out-turn result from each
site. The principal estimation technique used by the Group in
attributing profit on sites to a particular period is the preparation of
forecasts on a site-by-site basis. These focus on revenues and costs to
complete and enable an assessment to be made of the final out-turn
on each site. Consistent review procedures are in place in respect of
site forecasting. Provision is made for any losses foreseen in
completing a site as soon as they become apparent.
(d) Property development
Revenue in respect of property developments is taken on
unconditional exchange of contracts on disposal of finished
developments. Profit taken is subject to any amounts necessary to
cover residual commitments relating to development performance.
Provision is made for any losses foreseen in completing a development
as soon as they become apparent.
Where developments are sold in advance of construction being
completed, revenue and profit are recognised from the point of sale
and as the significant outstanding acts of construction and
development are completed. If a development is sold in advance of the
commencement of construction, no revenue or profit is recognised at
the point of sale. Revenue and profit are recognised in line with the
Annual Report and Accounts 2013 — 77
Overview Operational review Corporate responsibility Financial review Governance Financial statements progress on construction, based on the percentage completion of the
construction and development work. If a development is sold during
construction but prior to completion, revenue and profit are recognised
at the time of sale in line with the percentage completion of the
construction and development works at the time of sale and thereafter
in line with the percentage of completion of the construction and
development works.
If a development is sold after construction and development works are
completed revenue and profit are recognised in full at the point of sale.
(e) PFI service concession agreements
Revenue relating to construction or upgrade services under a service
concession arrangement is recognised based on the stage of
completion of the work performed, consistent with the Group’s
accounting policy on recognising revenue on construction contracts
(see previous page). Operation or service revenue is recognised in the
period in which the services were provided by the Group. When the
Group provides more than one service in a service concession
agreement, the consideration received is allocated by reference to the
relative fair values of the services delivered.
Pre-contract costs
Costs associated with bidding for contracts are written off as incurred
(pre-contract costs). When it is probable that a contract will be
awarded, usually when the Group has secured preferred bidder status,
costs incurred from that date to the date of financial close are carried
forward in the balance sheet as Other receivables.
When financial close is achieved on Private Finance Initiative (PFI) or
Public Private Partnership (PPP) contracts, costs are recovered from
the special purpose vehicle and pre-contract costs within this recovery
that were not previously capitalised are credited to the income
statement, except to the extent that the Group retains a share in the
special purpose vehicle. The amount not credited is deferred and
recognised over the life of the construction contract to which the costs
relate.
Property, plant and equipment and depreciation
Depreciation is based on historical or deemed cost, less the estimated
residual value, and the estimated economic lives of the assets
concerned. Freehold land is not depreciated. Other tangible assets are
depreciated in equal annual instalments over the period of their
estimated economic lives, which are principally as follows:
Freehold buildings 25-50 years
Leasehold buildings and improvements Period of lease
Plant, equipment and vehicles 3-12 years
Assets held under finance leases are depreciated over the shorter of
the term of the lease or the expected useful life of the asset.
Leases
Leases in terms of which the Group assumes substantially all of the
risks and rewards of ownership are classified as finance leases. On
initial recognition the leased asset is measured at an amount equal to
the lower of its fair value and the present value of the minimum lease
payments. Subsequent to initial recognition, the asset is accounted for
in accordance with the accounting policy applicable to that asset.
Other leases are operating leases and the rental charges are charged
to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the life of each
lease.
Employee benefits
(a) Retirement benefit obligations
For defined contribution pension schemes operated by the Group,
amounts payable are charged to the income statement as they fall due.
For defined benefit pension schemes, the cost of providing benefits is
calculated annually by independent actuaries using the projected unit
credit method. The charge to the income statement reflects the current
and past service costs of such obligations, and the interest cost on
scheme liabilities less the expected return on plan assets.
The retirement benefit obligation represents the difference between
the fair value of scheme assets and the present value of scheme
liabilities. It is determined bi-annually by independent actuaries and
recognised fully in the balance sheet. Differences between the actual
and expected returns on assets and experience gains and losses
arising on scheme liabilities during the year, together with differences
arising from changes in assumptions, are recognised fully in reserves
through the statement of comprehensive income in the year.
The recognised pension asset is limited to the present value of any
future refunds from the plan or reductions in future contributions to
the plan expected at the balance sheet date.
The Group’s contributions to the schemes are paid in accordance with
the rules of the schemes and the recommendation of the actuary.
(b) Share-based payments
Share-based payments granted but not vested, are valued at the fair
value of the shares at the date of grant. This affects the Sharesave and
LTIP schemes. The fair value of these schemes at the date of award is
calculated using the Black-Scholes model.
The cost to the Group of awards to employees under the LTIP scheme
is spread on a straight-line basis over the relevant performance period.
The scheme awards to senior employees a number of shares which will
vest after three years if particular criteria are met. The Group has the
option to make the awards either as shares or as a combination of
shares and cash, based on the share price prevailing when the shares
vest. The cost of the share-based payment element of the scheme is
based on the fair value of the shares at the date the options are
granted, and the cost of the cash-based payment element is based on
the market value of the share options at the balance sheet date.
Shares purchased and held in trust in connection with the Group’s
share schemes are deducted from retained earnings. No gain or loss is
recognised within the income statement on the market value of these
shares compared to the original cost.
Finance income and costs
Interest receivable and payable on bank balances is credited or
charged to the income statement as incurred.
Borrowing costs are capitalised where the Group constructs qualifying
assets. All other borrowing costs are written off to the income
statement as incurred.
Borrowing costs incurred within the Group’s jointly controlled entities
relating to the construction of assets in PFI and PPP projects are
capitalised until the relevant assets are brought into operational use.
Notional interest payable, representing the unwinding of the discount
on long-term liabilities, is charged to finance costs.

Notes to the
consolidated financial
statements
For the year ended 30 June 2013
1 Significant accounting policies continued Taxation
Income tax comprises current and deferred tax. Income tax is
recognised in the income statement except to the extent that it relates
to items recognised directly in equity, in which case it is also
recognised in equity.
Current tax is the expected tax payable on taxable income for the year,
using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet
date, and any adjustment to tax payable in respect of previous years.
Deferred tax is provided using the balance sheet liability method,
providing for temporary differences between the carrying amounts of
assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts
used for taxation purposes. The deferred tax provision is based on the
expected manner of realisation or settlement of the carrying amount of
the assets and liabilities, using tax rates enacted or substantively
enacted at the balance sheet date.
A deferred tax asset is recognised only to the extent that it is probable
that future taxable profits will be available against which the asset can
be utilised. Deferred tax assets are reduced to the extent that it is no
longer probable that the related tax benefit will be realised.
Foreign currencies
Transactions denominated in foreign currencies are recorded at the
exchange rates in effect when they take place. Resulting foreign currency
denominated assets and liabilities are translated at the exchange rates
ruling at the balance sheet date. Exchange differences arising from
foreign currency transactions are reflected in the income statement.
The assets and liabilities of overseas subsidiary undertakings are
translated at the rate of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date.
Trading profits or losses are translated at average rates prevailing
during the accounting period. Differences on exchange arising from the
retranslation of net investments in overseas subsidiary undertakings at
the year-end rates are recognised in the translation reserve. All other
translation differences are reflected in the income statement.
Mining assets
Opencast expenditure incurred prior to the commencement of
operating an opencast site is capitalised and the cost less the residual
value is depreciated over the ‘coaling life’ of the site on a coal
extraction basis.
The cost of restoration is recognised as a provision as soon as the
restoration liability arises. The amount provided represents the present
value of the anticipated costs. Costs are charged against the provision
as incurred and the unwinding of the discount is included within
finance costs. A tangible asset is created for an amount equivalent to
the initial provision and depreciated on a coal extraction basis over the
life of the asset. Where there is a subsequent change to the estimated
restoration costs or discount rate, the present value of the change is
recognised as a change in the restoration provision with a
corresponding change in the cost of the tangible asset until the asset
is fully depreciated when the remaining adjustment is taken to the
income statement.
Inventories
Inventories and work in progress, including land held for and in the
course of development, are valued at the lower of cost and net
realisable value. Cost comprises direct materials and, where
appropriate, labour and production overheads which have been
incurred in bringing the inventories and work in progress to their
present location and condition. Cost in certain circumstances also
includes notional interest as explained in the accounting policy for
finance income and costs. Net realisable value represents the
estimated selling price less all estimated costs of completion and costs
to be incurred in marketing, selling and distribution.
Construction work in progress is included within inventories in the
balance sheet. It is measured at cost plus profit less losses recognised
to date less progress billings. If payments received from customers
exceed the income recognised, the difference is included within trade
and other payables in the balance sheet.
Land inventory is recognised at the time a liability is recognised;
generally after exchange of unconditional contracts.
Property inventory, which represents all development land and work in
progress, is included at cost less any losses foreseen in completing
and disposing of the development less any amounts received or
receivable as progress payments or part disposals. Where a property is
being developed, cost includes cost of acquisition and development to
date, including directly attributable fees, expenses and finance
charges net of rental or other income attributable to the development.
Where development property is not being actively developed, net rental
income and finance costs are taken to the income statement.
Assets held for sale
Assets classified as held for sale are measured at the lower of their
carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell.
Assets are classified as held for sale if their carrying amount will be
recovered through a sale transaction rather than through continuing
use. This condition is regarded as met only when the sale is highly
probable and the assets are available for sale in their present condition.
Share capital
The ordinary share capital of the Company is recorded at the proceeds
received, net of directly attributable incremental issue costs.
Provisions
Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present legal or
constructive obligation as a result of a past event, and where it is
probable that an outflow will be required to settle the obligation and
the amount can be reliably estimated.
Financial instruments
Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognised in the Group’s
balance sheet when the Group becomes a party to the contractual
provisions of the instrument. The principal financial assets and
liabilities of the Group are as follows:
(a) Trade receivables and trade payables
Given the varied activities of the Group it is not practicable to identify a
common operating cycle. The Group has therefore allocated
receivables and payables due within 12 months of the balance sheet
date to current with the remainder included in non-current.
Trade receivables do not carry interest and are stated at their initial
value reduced by appropriate allowances for estimated irrecoverable
amounts.
Trade payables on normal terms are not interest bearing and are
stated at their nominal value. Trade payables on extended terms,
particularly in respect of land purchases, are discounted and recorded
at their present value.
(b) Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents in the cash flow statement comprise cash
at bank and in hand, including bank deposits with original maturities of
three months or less, net of bank overdrafts. Bank overdrafts are
included within financial liabilities in current liabilities in the balance
sheet.
Annual Report and Accounts 2013 — 79
Overview Operational review Corporate responsibility Financial review Governance Financial statements (c) Bank and other borrowings
Interest-bearing bank and other loans are recorded at the fair value of
the proceeds received, net of direct issue costs. Finance charges,
including premiums payable on settlement or redemption and direct
issue costs, are accounted for on an accruals basis in the income
statement using the effective interest method and are added to the
carrying value of the instrument to the extent that they are not settled
in the period in which they arise.
(d) PFI assets
Under the terms of a PFI or similar project, where the risks and rewards
of ownership remain largely with the purchaser of the associated
services, the Group’s interest in the asset is classified as a financial
asset and included at its amortised cost within investment in joint
ventures.
(e) Derivative financial instruments
Derivatives are initially recognised at fair value on the date that the
contract is entered into and subsequently re-measured in future
periods at their fair value. The method of recognising the resulting
change in fair value depends on whether the derivative is designated
as a hedging instrument and whether the hedging relationship is
effective.
For cash flow hedges the effective part of the change in fair value of
these derivatives is recognised directly in equity. Any ineffective portion
is recognised immediately in the income statement. Amounts
accumulated in equity are re-cycled to the income statement in the
periods when the hedged items will affect profit or loss. The fair value
of interest rate derivatives is the estimated amount that the Group
would receive or pay to terminate the derivatives at the balance sheet
date.
If the hedging instrument no longer meets the criteria for hedge
accounting, expires or is sold, terminated or exercised, the hedge
accounting is discontinued prospectively. The cumulative gain or loss
previously recognised in equity remains there until the forecast
transaction occurs.
The Group enters into forward contracts in order to hedge against
transactional foreign currency exposures. In cases where these
derivative instruments are significant, hedge accounting is applied as
described above. Where hedge accounting is not applied, changes in
fair value of derivatives are recognised in the income statement. Fair
values are based on quoted market prices at the balance sheet date.
Accounting estimates and judgements
The key assumptions concerning the future and other key sources of
estimation uncertainty at the balance sheet date, that have a
significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying
amounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial year are as
follows:
(a) Revenue and profit recognition
The estimation techniques used for revenue and profit recognition in
respect of private housing and land sales, property development and
construction contracts.
(b) Valuation of land and work in progress
The key judgements and estimates in determining the net realisable
value of land and work in progress were:
• an estimation of costs to complete;
• an estimation of the remaining revenues; and
• an estimation of selling costs.
These assessments include a degree of uncertainty and therefore if
the key judgements and estimates change, further impairments of land
and work in progress may be necessary.
(c) Determination of fair values of identifiable net assets on
acquisitions
The accounting for the Kier Developments Limited acquisition involved
identifying and determining the fair values to be assigned to the
existing 50% interest in the joint venture, as well as the identifiable
assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities acquired and the cost of
acquisition. The determination of fair values involved some key
judgements and estimates, particularly in relation to the fair value of
the property portfolio. The key judgements and estimates made in
determining the fair value of the property portfolio were:
• the appropriate yields;
• an estimation of costs to complete;
• assumptions around planning permissions; and
• an estimation of likely rentals, or forecast sales prices.
(d) Defined benefit pension scheme valuations
In determining the valuation of defined benefit pension scheme assets
and liabilities, a number of key assumptions have been made. The key
assumptions, which are given below, are largely dependent on factors
outside the control of the Group:
• expected return on plan assets;
• inflation rate;
• mortality;
• discount rate; and
• salary and pension increases.
Details of the assumptions used are included in note 8.

1 Significant accounting policies continued The Group operates three divisions; Construction, Services and Property, and this is the basis on which the Group manages and reports its
primary segmental information. Corporate includes unrecovered overheads and the charge for defined benefit pension schemes.
Segment information is based on the information provided to the chief executive who is the chief operating decision maker. The segments are
strategic business units with separate management and have different core customers and offer different services. The segments are discussed
in the chief executive’s review on pages 08 to 11.
The accounting policies of the operating segments are the same as those described in the summary of significant accounting policies on
pages 76 to 80. The Group evaluates segment information on the basis of profit or loss from operations before exceptional items, interest and
income tax expense. The segment results that are reported to the chief executive include items directly attributable to a segment as well as
those that can be allocated on a reasonable basis.

For the year ended 30 June 2013
5 Finance income and cost The Group operates a number of pension schemes for eligible employees as described below.
Kier Group Pension Scheme
This is the principal scheme and includes a defined benefit section and a defined contribution section. The assets of the Scheme are held in
trust separate from the assets of the Group. The trustees are responsible for investing the assets and delegate day-to-day decisions to
independent professional investment managers.
The defined benefit section of the Scheme was closed to new entrants on 1 January 2002; existing members continue to accrue benefits for
future service.
An actuarial valuation of the Scheme was undertaken by the trustees’ independent actuaries as at 1 April 2010 using the projected unit method.
The market value of the Scheme’s assets at that date was £622.0m which represented approximately 88% of the benefits that had accrued to
members at that date, after allowing for future increases in salaries. The contributions paid during the year were £29.4m (2012: £20.9m) which
included special contributions of £20.1m (2012: £11.1m) to fund the past service deficit.
Going forward, contributions will include an allowance for funding the past service deficit identified at the 2010 valuation date. The Group
expects to make contributions for future service of £9.4m, being 20.5% of pensionable pay until 1 April 2014 and 21.8% of pensionable pay
thereafter, plus £10.8m for funding the past service deficit in the year to June 2014.
The Pension Protection Fund (PPF) levy is payable in addition to the above contributions.
Following closure of the defined benefit section of the Scheme to new entrants most new employees are offered membership of the defined
contribution section of the Kier Group Pension Scheme. The Group is required to pay contributions in respect of those employees in accordance
with the rates specified in their contracts of employment. The contributions paid during the year, and the pension charge, amounted to £13.7m
(2012: £12.7m).
An actuarial valuation of the Kier Group Pension Scheme is currently being carried out as at 1 April 2013.
Kier Sheffield LLP
The Group participates in this defined benefit scheme through its subsidiary Kier Sheffield LLP which has participated as an admitted body in
the South Yorkshire Pension Fund since 1 April 2003. As an admitted body it was granted a fully funded past service position at that date, with
assets and past service liabilities of £65.0m.
The scheme covers 1,146 employees who transferred from Sheffield Council’s employment to Kier Sheffield LLP at the start of the contract. New
employees are offered membership of the defined contribution section of the Kier Group Pension Scheme. Kier Sheffield LLP is required to pay
contributions in respect of these employees in accordance with the rates specified in their contracts of employment.
Kier Sheffield LLP’s pension costs in respect of the defined benefit scheme are assessed on the advice of an independent qualified actuary
using the projected unit method. The contributions paid during the year were £1.8m (2012: £2.2m). Going forward Kier Sheffield LLP expects to
pay contributions for future service at the rate of 10.5% of pensionable pay.
An actuarial valuation of the South Yorkshire Pension Fund is currently being carried out as at 1 April 2013.
Other schemes
Contributions are also made in respect of hourly paid operatives to an industry-wide stakeholder pension scheme and in respect of employees
who are members of a local government pension scheme. The pension costs for these have been taken as the actual contributions paid during
the year.
In response to the Government’s recent legislation on automatic enrolment of employees into workplace pensions, the Group selected the
People’s Pension (which is run by B&CE) as a workplace pension arrangement and expects to pay in the future contributions of up to £1.5m p.a.
in relation to this arrangement.

Pension sensitivity
The assumption considered to be the most significant is the discount rate adopted. If the discount rate were to increase by 0.1% the Kier Group
Pension Scheme deficit would decrease by £14.6m, and the Kier Sheffield LLP liability would decrease by £3.6m resulting in a surplus of £2.6m.

Kier Group and its subsidiaries are based predominantly in the UK and are subject to UK corporation tax. Where Kier operates overseas this will
generally be either through UK resident companies or branches of UK companies, and therefore these companies will pay UK corporation tax
subject to the offset of local overseas tax. The Group does not have an aggressive tax policy and has not entered into any tax avoidance schemes
which were, or should have been, notified to HMRC under the Disclosure of Tax Avoidance Scheme (DOTAS) rules during the year or previous year.
The tax charge before exceptional items and amortisation of contract rights of £8.9m (2012: £9.3m) shown in the table above equates to an
effective tax rate of 14% (2012: 13%) on adjusted profit before tax of £63.2m (2012: £70.2m). This effective rate is lower than the standard rate
of corporation tax of 23.75% (2012: 25.5%) due to a number of items shown in the table above.
The effect of the change in the UK corporation tax rate arises principally as a result of the impact of the rate change on the deferred tax asset
related to the retirement benefit obligations. In accordance with accounting standards the effect of the change in the tax rate on the deferred tax
balance is recognised in the same primary statement that the original deferred tax balance was recognised in. The original deferred tax balance
relating to the retirement benefit obligation is made up of two larger amounts that were previously recognised in part through the income
statement and in part through the statement of comprehensive income. This has resulted in a credit in the income statement and a charge in the
statement of comprehensive income for the years ended 30 June 2012 and 30 June 2013.

9 Taxation In accordance with UK tax legislation, capital gains arising on disposal of certain investments, including some of the joint ventures disposed of
during the year, are not subject to tax.
Tax relief on expenses not recognised in the income statement includes the impact of the tax deduction received in respect of the cost of shares
exercised under the Group’s employee Save As You Earn Scheme.
As a result of additional investment made in joint ventures, there is more certainty that existing tax losses will be utilised against trading profits in
the short term, and in accordance with accounting standards a deferred tax asset has been recognised.
The adjustment in respect of prior years’ results from differences between the estimates of taxation included in the previous year’s financial
statements and the actual tax liabilities calculated in the tax returns submitted to and agreed by HMRC.
(b) Recognised in the cash flow statement
The cash flow statement shows a repayment of £3.5m during the year. Tax payments are generally lower than the tax charge in the income
statement because tax deductions are claimed for pension contributions based on the level of contributions actually paid, and pension
payments in the year exceed the amount included in the income statement.
During the year Kier received a corporate tax repayment from HMRC which related to earlier periods.

(d) Factors that may affect future tax charges
The Chancellor has announced the main rate of corporation tax will be 24%, from April 2012, 23% from April 2013, 21% from April 2014 and
20% from April 2015.
The reduction to 23% has had the effect of reducing the net deferred tax asset included in the above figures by £1.5m, with £1.4m being
credited to the income statement and £2.9m being charged directly to the statement of comprehensive income.
The reduction in the main rate of UK corporation tax from 23% to 21% was substantively enacted on 2 July 2013 and is effective from 1 April
2014. This will reduce the Group's future tax charge accordingly.
If the rate change from 23% to 21% had been substantively enacted at 30 June 2013 it would have had the effect of reducing the net deferred
tax asset of £27.4m (Group: £23.5 asset, joint ventures £3.9m asset) held at this date by £3.3m, with £2.8m being credited to the income
statement and £6.1m being charged directly to the statement of comprehensive income.
It has not been possible to fully quantify the anticipated effect of the further 1% rate reduction from 21% to 20%, although this is expected to
reduce the Group's future tax charge and reduce deferred tax assets accordingly.
(e) Tax losses
At the balance sheet date the Group has unused income tax losses of £10.3m (2012: £10.0m) available for offset against future profits. A
deferred tax asset has been recognised in respect of £10.2m (2012: £9.3m) of these losses. No deferred tax asset has been recognised in
respect of the remaining losses, due to the unpredictability of future profit streams against which these losses could be offset. Under present tax
legislation, these losses may be carried forward indefinitely.

The value per option represents the fair value of the option less the consideration payable.
The fair value of the TSR element incorporates an assessment of the number of shares that will be awarded, as the performance conditions are
market conditions under IFRS 2 ‘Share-based payments’.
The performance conditions of the EPS element are non-market conditions under IFRS 2. The fair value therefore does not include an
assessment of the number of shares that will be awarded. Instead the amount charged for this element is based on the fair value factored by a
‘true-up’ for the number of awards that are expected to vest.
The expected volatility is based on historical volatility over the last three years. The risk-free rate of return is the yield on zero-coupon UK
Government bonds of a term consistent with the assumed option life.

Capital risk management
The Group’s capital management objectives are; to ensure the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern; to optimise the capital structure in
order to minimise the cost of capital; and to maintain a strong balance sheet to support business development and tender qualification. The
three operating divisions of the Group have complementary capital characteristics, with the Construction division, and to a lesser extent the
Services division, generating a net cash surplus, whilst the Property division requires net capital to fund developments. The Group’s capital
management strategy is to use a blend of capital types with different risk, return and maturity profiles to support the operating divisions and
deliver the Group’s capital management objectives. The Group’s overall capital risk management strategy remains unchanged from 2012.
The capital structure of the Group comprises: equity, consisting of share capital, share premium, retained earnings and other reserves as
disclosed in the consolidated statement of changes in equity; and cash, cash equivalents and borrowings as disclosed in note 20 and described
further below. The Group forecasts and monitors short, medium and longer-term capital needs on a regular basis and adjusts its capital
structure as required through the payment of dividends to shareholders, the issue of new share capital and the increase or repayment of
borrowings. All investment decisions are made with regard to the Group’s weighted average cost of capital and typically a pre-tax annualised
return of at least 15% is required to ensure such investments are value enhancing for shareholders.
Financial risk management
Financial risk management is an integral part of the way the Group is managed. In the course of its business, the Group is exposed primarily to
credit risk, market risk and liquidity risk. The overall aim of the Group’s financial risk management policies is to minimise any potential adverse
effects on financial performance and net assets.
The Group’s treasury team manages the principal financial risks within policies and operating limits approved by the Board. Treasury is not a
profit centre and does not enter into speculative transactions. Derivative financial instruments are used to hedge exposure to fluctuations in
interest and exchange rates.
Credit risk
Credit risk arises on financial instruments such as trade receivables, short-term bank deposits and interest rate and currency hedges.
Policies and procedures exist to ensure that customers have an appropriate credit history.
Short-term bank deposits and hedging transactions are executed only with highly credit-rated authorised counterparties based on ratings issued
by the major ratings agencies. Counter-party exposure positions are monitored regularly so that credit exposures to any one counterparty are
within predetermined limits. At the balance sheet date there were no significant concentrations of credit risk.
Trade and other receivables included in the balance sheet are stated net of a bad debt provision which has been estimated by management
following a review of individual, receivable accounts. There is no Group-wide rate of provision and provision made for debts that are overdue is
based on prior default experience and known factors at the balance sheet date. Receivables are written off against the bad debt provision when
management considers that the debt is no longer recoverable.

Provision as at 30 June 1.3 1.2
There are £13.2m (2012: £41.4m) of trade receivables that were overdue at the balance sheet date that have not been provided against, of
which £7.7m (2012: £29.9m) had been received by the end of August 2013. There are no indications as at 30 June 2013 that the debtors will
not meet their payment obligations in respect of the amount of trade receivables recognised in the balance sheet that are overdue and
unprovided. The proportion of trade receivables at 30 June 2013 that were overdue for payment was 5.7% (2012: 15%). Credit terms vary across
the Group; the average age of trade receivables was as follows:
Construction 46 days (2012: 54 days)
Services 34 days (2012: 37 days)
Overall, the Group considers that it is not exposed to significant credit risk.
Market risk
Interest rate risk
The Group has mitigated part of its exposure to interest rate fluctuations through an issue, in December 2012, of 7 and 10-year loan notes,
principal amounts of £45m and USD28m. Loan notes denominated in US dollars were hedged back-to-back with cross-currency swaps. The loan
notes carry fixed rates of interest.
The Group has borrowing facilities to finance short-term working capital requirements and term loans to finance medium-term capital
requirements, which carry interest at floating rates, at a margin over LIBOR.
In addition, a number of the Group’s PFI joint ventures have entered into interest rate swaps.
Foreign currency risk
The Group operates primarily within the UK such that its exposure to currency risk is not considered to be significant.
Where significant foreign currency exposures are identified these are hedged using forward foreign exchange contracts or swaps.
Liquidity risk
The Group’s policy on liquidity risk is to ensure that sufficient borrowing facilities are available to fund operations without the need to carry
significant net debt over the medium term. The Group’s principal borrowing facilities are provided by a group of relationship banks in the form of
unsecured committed borrowing facilities. The amount of committed borrowing facilities available to the Group is reviewed regularly and is
designed to exceed forecast peak gross debt levels.

Fuel price forward contracts have been accounted for as derivatives held at fair value through the income statement. The fair value of these
contracts has been determined based on a level 2 valuation method, using valuation techniques that include inputs that are based on
observable market data.
During the year Kier Group plc entered in to three cross-currency fixed interest rate swaps to hedge the interest rate and currency risk on a
US dollar denominated loan, nominal value USD 28m. These swaps have met the criteria for hedge accounting and as a result have been
recognised directly in equity.

In addition to the above, a number of the Group’s PFI joint ventures have entered into interest rate derivatives as a means of hedging interest
rate risk. Interest-bearing debts and associated interest rate derivatives within these joint ventures have a typical term of between 25 and
30 years and are without recourse to the Group. At 30 June 2013 the aggregate amount outstanding on these interest-bearing debts against
which interest rate derivatives are held is £175.9m. The Group’s share of the total net fair value liability of these interest rate derivatives at
30 June 2013, based on quoted prices in active markets, amounted to £16.5m which, together with the related deferred tax asset of £3.9m,
have met the criteria for hedge accounting and as a result have been recognised directly in equity.

Gurney provides support services and delivers a wide range of essential front-line services to the public and regulated sectors.
The acquisition represents an excellent opportunity to accelerate Kier’s strategy for its Services division. The Kier Board believes the acquisition
is highly complementary and will provide an increased breadth of services, skills, geographic coverage and operating efficiencies, representing
an attractive proposition for its clients (and those of the enlarged Group) and enhanced value for the shareholder base of the enlarged Group.
Due to the proximity of the acquisition to Kier Group plc’s reporting date, the fair values of assets and liabilities acquired have been reported at
book value and are provisional to allow for further adjustments in the measurement period.

For the year ended 30 June 2013
1 Accounting policies
The following accounting policies have been applied consistently in dealing with items which are considered material.
Basis of preparation
The financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention, on the going concern basis and in accordance with UK GAAP.
A cash flow statement has not been presented as permitted by FRS 1 (revised) ‘Cash flow statements’.
Fixed asset investments
Investments in subsidiary undertakings are included in the balance sheet at cost less any provision for diminution in value.
Deferred taxation
In accordance with FRS 19 ‘Deferred tax’, deferred taxation is provided fully and on a non-discounted basis at expected future corporation tax
rates in respect of timing differences between profits computed for taxation and accounts purposes.
Own shares
The cost of the Company’s investment in its own shares, which comprises shares held by the Kier Group 1999 Employee Benefit Trust for the
purpose of funding the Company’s share option plans, is shown as a reduction in shareholders’ funds in the share scheme reserve.
Share-based payments
The Company issues equity-settled share-based payments under the Sharesave and LTIP schemes. The fair value of these schemes at the date
of grant is expressed on a straight-line basis over the vesting period, based on the estimate of shares that will eventually vest. Share-based
payments are charged wholly to the ultimate parent company, which makes internal recharges to subsidiaries for these services as appropriate.
Financial instruments
The Company’s principal financial assets and liabilities are cash at bank and borrowings. Cash at bank is carried in the balance sheet at nominal
value. Borrowings are recognised initially at fair value and subsequently at amortised cost.
The consolidated financial statements include disclosures in note 27 under IFRS 7 which comply with FRS 29 ‘Financial Instruments and
Disclosures’. Consequently, the Company has taken advantage of certain exemptions in FRS 29 from the requirement to present separate
financial instrument disclosures for the Company.

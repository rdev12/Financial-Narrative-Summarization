Chairman’s
Statement 
These are exciting times at Highams. We have a revamped Board.
We have a new Chief Executive, Dave Pye. We have opened a
new Highams office in the heart of our client base in the City of
London. We have considerably enlarged our sales team. We have
agreed ambitious plans for the year ahead.
Our goal is to make a step change in the Group’s performance. We
recognised as a Board that such a step change was not likely without
new personnel at all levels of the organisation, starting at the top! 
I strongly encourage you to read our new Chief Executive’s Report to
learn more of the year ended 31 March 2007 and, importantly, what 
is in store for this current financial year and the future.
The results for the last financial year, given below, reveal the progress
we are making in our move to higher margin business, albeit the
bottom line was inevitably impacted by the investment at the start 
of the new change programme. The current financial year will be one 
of continued investment as we implement our plans, which we expect
to see bear fruit in this and subsequent years. 
Financial Results
The Group made an operating loss of £120,000 before goodwill
amortisation of £128,000 (2006: profit of £192,000 before goodwill
amortisation of £128,000), in the main reflecting our increased
investment in the second half of the year.
Group loss before taxation was £313,000 (2006: loss of £13,000). 
Reflecting the Group’s move towards higher margin business and 
a greater percentage of permanent business, Group turnover fell by 
10 per cent. to £16.3m (2006: £18.0m) as we undertook a reduced
volume of low-margin contract business, but gross profit still grew by
2.5% to £2.2m (2006: £2.1m) representing 13.29% of turnover, a
significant improvement compared to 11.73% in 2006. 
The Directors are not recommending the payment of a final dividend for the
year to 31 March 2007 (2006: nil).
Trading Review
Our emphasis has been, and remains, on finding higher value business
through further enhancing our capabilities to provide a specialised
range of services to smaller and medium sized organisations. We have
continued to seek and win new clients that meet these criteria in our
niche market sectors of insurance, investment management and
financial services.
We have achieved this refocusing of our strategy whilst managing to
modestly improve our levels of net fee income. Compared to the previous
year, our volume of low-margin business has reduced substantially,
while higher-margin contract business has increased by around 5%
and permanent business has increased by 90%. 
Trading in our specialist areas has remained positive, with a continuing
emphasis on demand for permanent staff. This stronger demand for
permanent staff compared to contract personnel is traditionally a sign
of a confident market. 
Demand is particularly strong, across the board, for individuals with
project and programme management skills, business analysis experience
related to business intelligence and regulatory reporting, and those with
web development skills in our niche markets. 
Investment
In 2007 /08, we are making substantial investments in new initiatives,
additional staff, targeted training, our London premises and overseas
expansion. We expect that our niche markets will remain strong for 
the next two or three years at least, making this an opportune time to
be investing in our ambitious plans. Inevitably there are normal risks
associated with such an investment programme, and the delivery of 
the benefits from the investments will lag behind the costs. I therefore

whilst the second half of the year should be more balanced. Such
investments will initially also require greater use of our finance facilities
and hence higher interest charges will likely be incurred. 
Board Changes
On 3 January 2007 we welcomed Dave Pye as our new CEO,
following an intensive selection process. Dave brings substantial sales
and senior-level management experience, a wealth of contacts and
extensive influence within the IT recruitment industry to his new role 
at Highams and has used all of this to determine and drive the exciting
change programme on which we have embarked.
On Dave’s appointment, Ted Andrews stepped aside as Managing
Director to assume the position of Chief Operating Officer.
We announced the resignations of Glen Burbidge and Tony Eve,
effective from 31 March 2007 and 11 May 2007 respectively. Glen
Burbidge’s Board responsibilities have been assumed by Dave Pye
whilst his operational duties have been taken over by Mark de Lacy,
who runs our Caterham sales team, and Paul Byrne who is in charge 
of our London sales office. Tony Eve’s Board and operational
responsibilities have been absorbed into Ted Andrews’ role.
Executives and Staff
We remain unusual amongst recruitment companies in having a high
number of very knowledgeable and long-serving staff. I am extremely
grateful to them for their loyalty and their eagerness to support the
significant changes we are effecting in the Company. I extend a warm
welcome to our newer staff and hope that many of them will develop
along similar lines as their experienced colleagues.
Outlook
As I stated in my introduction, these are exciting times at Highams with
a great number of very positive changes in progress. Dave Pye’s CEO’s
Report explains many of these changes, demonstrating the thought
leadership, practical approach and infectious energy and enthusiasm 
he has brought to Highams.
With the continuing strength of our marketplace and our determined
approach to delivering high-quality, high-value recruitment consultancy
services, I look forward to the Group’s continued progress in the
months ahead with confidence.

tomer experiences. The rising importance of recruitment companies
The search for talent has remained one of the top priorities for Chief
Executives during the past year. Its importance will continue in the next
five years as organisations realise that what McKinsey once called the
‘War for Talent’ is having a major impact on recruitment companies in
Europe and globally. Two significant reports on Talent and Recruitment
in The Economist (Oct 06) and by Demos* and the Recruitment and
Employment Confederation (April 07) have shown how recruitment is
changing and how increasingly important intermediaries such as
Highams are in the provision of talent to organisations. 
We fully expect that changing demographics, new attitudes to career
expectations and more dependence from employers on a good
personality fit (compared to simply a good skills fit) will place greater
emphasis on high-quality, network orientated recruitment methods. 
Highams operates in this arena and is creating a niche for itself in the
provision of senior appointments in technology in the financial services
sector. Highams’ role as an intermediary between contingent and
permanent talent and our customers continues to be recognised by our
long standing customers and those new clients who started benefiting
from Highams’ services in the past year.
Challenging Highams in a Changing World 
Since my arrival in January 07 , there has been much change at
Highams to ensure we make the most of the rising importance of
recruitment companies to organisations. The market in the UK and
Europe continues to grow. This year Highams has hired 15 new people
to tap into this growth. Our focus has remained in financial services 
and I am delighted to report Highams has secured a number of new
customers in the last quarter of 2006/07 . Whilst the focus away from
some of the historic, lower margin, preferred supplier business has had
an effect on the revenue line, proportionally the net fee income as a
percentage of sales is rising.
Our approach has been to refine our offering to our customers – both
to our consultants and candidates and to organisations which hire 
them. Highams offers two distinct services; a private client approach 
in the provision of senior consultants who have worked with Highams 
in the past and a retail approach for general business with a wider
range of customers. This has resulted in Highams developing deeper
relationships with significant customers and allowing us to offer them 
a wider range of value-creating services whilst, at the same time,
maintaining our existing business with customers where Highams
places people with organisations on an occasional basis.
Our major focus for 07/08 is to ensure Highams is at the forefront 
in our sector in maximizing the efficiency provided by Web 2.0. In the
words of the Demos report, “Web 2.0 sees the internet as a collaborative
tool, where we each have a role in creating value for one another.” as is
happening, for instance, with YouTube, LinkedIn and Facebook. This will
result in attracting talent for our customer base and ensuring that talent
can communicate with one another and with Highams. The relationship
that Highams builds with its candidates and consultants will be
increasingly vital to its success in a world where those who manage
and deliver top talent will become ever more important and successful.
The International Dimension
As our customer base grows so will our presence internationally. Our
business in Brussels has grown in 2006/07 and our innovative model
of using local home-workers in Belgium is a formula that Highams will
use internationally during the coming 12 months. This model primarily
involves ex-patriates, typically parents returning to full or part-time work
having had families. They are excellent recruiters and their intelligence
combined with our workforce flexibility will help develop and cement
stronger relationships with our customers. It is a low cost, high touch
model that will see Highams become an international organisation in 
a world where talent is sourced and delivered globally. As talented
people continue to move around, Highams will feature prominently in 
its sector. This approach is being executed initially by working with our

Report

Drive profitable ventures. international customers who are demanding Highams provides its
excellent UK services into other geographic locations.
Expansion in the UK
In April 2007 , we opened our first office in the UK outside our
Caterham headquarters. Taking an office on the 28th floor of the iconic
‘Gherkin’ building in the City of London has brought Highams closer 
to its financial services customers and is a base for our Platinum Club,
an invitation only community for our private client technology talent.
Highams continues to work alongside its customers as they seek 
to become more imaginative, utilise their brand in the most effective
way and ensure that, in the ‘digital age’, the technology that drives
organisations is provided by the very best people. Highams will
continue to provide the very best talent as it continues to grow 
with its customers in the coming years.
Our wider responsibility
Highams has recently selected Rainbow Trust, Trees for Cities and
Action Aid to partner. Working with Rainbow Trust, Highams’ staff will,
through various fund-raising events, raise money to provide support for
the families of sick children. 
We will also be raising awareness for our environment and for projects
overseas by making donations to Trees for Cities (for every interview)
and Action Aid (for every contract or permanent placement made). 
These partnerships are a great example of how we can work alongside
a charity, both motivating our staff in their work and demonstrating to
clients our social responsibility.
People making the difference
One of the key success factors for Highams to build on is the length 
of service of our people. Of our people who have been with us for 
more than a year, over 50% have been at Highams for more than 
10 years and a further 30% for more than 5 years. In a market where
traditionally recruiters move many times, our heritage of keeping our
top people is much appreciated by our customers, resulting in
continued and strong business renewals. Adding another 40% of
people to this team this year has already generated additional business
and will auger well for the coming years.
Today Highams employs 40 proud people. In this rising market they all
need to be at the top of their game. Those that were not, exited the
business in the final quarter of 2006/07 . For both our new colleagues
and our existing people, new training programmes have been developed.
Highams has taken an active role in the recruitment industry with its
involvement in the Recruitment and Employment Confederation. The
Highams brand, often quoted in the past 24 years but certainly relatively
quiet in the recent past, has been invigorated with a number of press
articles, customer events and charitable involvement in the first six
months of 2007 .
My role as CEO is to ensure our people are confident and happy in the
key role they play in our organisation and with their customers. It is to
drive this business back to sustainable, profitable growth and to provide
the platform to do so. Finally, it is to establish Highams as one of the
key organisations upon whose services its customers rely to drive their
businesses forward.
I am proud of our people and their dedication in this year of change
and excitement. I trust that you will share in our enthusiasm to make 
a difference in the recruitment sector and to see how our influence
matters as we devote ourselves to being the leading niche provider 
of technology talent in the financial services industry.

Dave Pye, Ted Andrews, Kerri
Sayers (seated), Mike Radlett,
Paul Byrne and Sarah Elliott. The directors present their report and the audited financial statements
for the Company and the Group for the year ended 31 March 2007 .
Principal Activity Highams is a specialist IT recruitment consultancy
and its principal activity is the provision of contract and permanent IT
recruitment services, mainly in the insurance, investment management
and financial sectors. Further details of the Group’s operations are
given in the Chief Executive’s Report.
Results and Dividends The Group recorded a loss before taxation 
of £313,000 (2006: loss £13,000) on a turnover of £16.3m 
(2006: £18.0m).
The directors do not recommend a final dividend (2006: nil). No interim
dividend was paid during the year (2006: nil). 
Review of Business The detailed review of the year and the significant
changes that are occurring are described in the Chairman’s Statement
and Chief Executive’s Report on pages 4 to 7.
The directors closely monitor a number of key performance indicators
in the business. The directors consider that the most important indicator
is the gross profit obtained from permanent and contract placements,
together with the average gross margin percentages achieved. It is
encouraging to note that gross profit increased by 2.5% during the
period, whilst average gross margin increased from 11.73% to 13.29%.
Key Financial Risks of the Group
Interest Rate Risk The Group finances its operations through a mixture
of retained profit, bank borrowings and invoice discounting. The Group
borrows in pounds sterling and euros. 
Liquidity Risk The Group’s policy is to ensure that it has adequate
financial resources to enable it to finance its day to day operations
based on cash flow projections. The Group’s working capital
requirements are usually short term in nature and accordingly the
Group uses short term overdraft and invoice discounting facilities.
Foreign Currency Risk The Group trades within Europe. Its transactions
are generally priced and invoiced in euros and the direct costs of the
sales are denominated in that currency. Risk arises on the monetary
assets and monetary liabilities of the Group that are not denominated 
in the functional currency of the operating unit concerned.
Credit Risk As the Group trades primarily within the financial services
sector, its experience of bad debt is very limited. However, credit 
ratings provided by credit rating agencies are obtained for all non 
‘blue chip’ clients. 
Key Business Risks of the Group
Staff Highams has an excellent record of staff retention in the
recruitment market. In a service company such as Highams, it is
essential that high-quality staff are recruited and then retained 
(through appropriate incentives, focused training and a challenging 
but supportive environment) if client relationships are to be maintained
and new customers won. 
Clients Clients may choose not to continue to use Highams’ services 
if our service fails to meet the required standards. We may also lose 
a client’s business if that client is acquired by a competitor.  
To help ensure the maintenance of high standards, Highams is
committed to the REC Code of Professional Practice and its ISO9001
certified quality management system. Importantly, longevity of service of
many Highams staff helps provide clients with continuity of dealing with
someone who has a detailed knowledge of their needs, a big factor in
helping retain clients.
Applicants and Contractors In a buoyant market, permanent applicants
usually have a greater choice of positions available to them whilst fewer
contractors might be seeking work. 
Highams’ staff work hard to be very knowledgeable about their niche
business and technical areas. By developing a network of clients, 
10 | HIGHAMS R&A.2007
Report of 
the Directors HIGHAMS R&A.2007 | 11
contractors and applicants relevant to that niche, Highams’ staff are
better positioned to attract and help talented contractors and applicants
than more generalist agencies might be. 
Competition There are many competing recruitment organisations. 
It is very important that Highams maintains and enhances its niche
market approach in order to continue to differentiate itself from most
other such organisations.

Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice.
Company law requires the directors to prepare financial statements for
each financial year which give a true and fair view of the state of affairs
of the Company and the Group and of the profit or loss of the Group
for that period. In preparing the financial statements, the directors are
required to:
4 select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently;
4 make judgements and estimates that are reasonable and prudent;
4 state whether applicable accounting standards have been followed,
subject to any material departures disclosed and explained in the
financial statements; and
4 prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis unless
it is inappropriate to assume that the Group will continue in business.
The directors are responsible for keeping proper accounting records
which disclose with reasonable accuracy, at any time, the financial
position of the Company and the Group and enable them to ensure
that the financial statements comply with the Companies Act 1985.
They are also responsible for safeguarding the assets of the Company
and the Group and hence for taking reasonable steps for the
prevention and detection of fraud and other irregularities.

Statement 
of Directors’
Responsibilities The Board is committed to high standards of corporate governance 
so that the Company’s management procedures are transparent and
clearly understood by those who work within the Company, and by
those who invest in it.
The Board The aim of the Board is to function at the head of the
Company’s management structures, leading and controlling its activities
and setting a strategy for enhancing shareholder value. Regular
strategy meetings are held to review the Group’s forward planning –
vital in a rapidly changing market and technology environment.
The Board currently consists of two executive directors and two non-
executive directors. The Company does not have a Nomination
Committee as such; the Board collectively undertakes the functions 
of such a committee.
The Chairman and the Chief Executive These tasks are carried out by
different individuals. They have a clear understanding as to the split of
responsibilities between them, and they meet regularly on a one-to-one
basis so that each is aware of the ideas and actions of the other.
Internal Control The Board has overall responsibility for ensuring that
the Group maintains systems and internal financial controls that provide
them with reasonable assurance regarding the financial information
both for use within the business and for external publication, and that
the assets are safeguarded.
An ongoing process has been established for identifying, evaluating
and managing the principal risks faced by the Group. The process 
has been in place for the full year under review and up to the date 
of approval of the annual report and financial statements. The Board
regularly reviews the process.
Audit Committee The Board collectively undertakes the functions 
of the Audit Committee which is chaired by John Higham. 
The terms of reference for the Audit Committee are to assist the 
Board in the discharge of its responsibilities for corporate governance,
financial reporting and internal control. Its duties include maintaining an
appropriate relationship with the Company’s auditors, keeping under
review the scope and results of the audit and its effectiveness.
The Audit Committee has sole responsibility for assessing the
independence of the external auditors, BDO Stoy Hayward LLP. 
The committee has had due regard to the document published in 
May 2003 by the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England 
and Wales (ICAEW) “Reviewing Auditor Independence: guidance for
audit committees”. Each year the committee undertakes to seek
reassurance that the external auditors are independent.
Remuneration Committee This committee (Recom), which meets at
least twice a year, is chaired by Alan Howarth; the Board collectively
undertakes the functions of Remcom. The Board has adopted a set 
of operational rules for Remcom which will be available for inspection
at the AGM. 
The Directors’ Remuneration Report is on page 15.
Going Concern After making appropriate enquires, the directors
consider that the Company has adequate resources to continue in
operational existence for the foreseeable future. For this reason, they
continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the financial
statements.

Statement 
of Corporate
Governance This report sets out the remuneration policies for the Group’s executive
directors. It should be read in conjunction with details of directors’
remuneration in note 5 which forms part of the audited financial
statements. The members of the remuneration committee (Remcom)
are identified on page 14. 
With the exception of Mr Andrews and Mr Pye, the members of
Remcom are independent of conflicts of interest arising from day 
to day running of the business. Remcom makes recommendations 
to the Board. No director is involved in discussion about his own
remuneration. 
Remuneration Policies Remcom recommends to the Board a
framework for executive remuneration. Remcom determines specific
packages for each executive director including pension rights and
compensation payments.
The general philosophy underlying the Group’s remuneration policy for
executive directors is the same as that applied to all senior employees in
order to encourage excellence. The basic components of remuneration
are: salary and benefits, cash bonuses, share schemes and pensions.
Salary and Benefits Remcom studies independent reports and market
trends in considering the level of salary and benefits. It also takes into
account experience, responsibility and performance. 
Bonuses Bonuses may be awarded at Remcom’s discretion depending
on Company performance and profits within the relevant business area.
Details of D Pye’s share and bonus scheme are given below.
Share Schemes Details of all Company share schemes, together 
with the performance incentives, appear in note 21 to the financial
statements.  
D Pye was granted options on 1,931,700 shares exercisable at 5.125p
per share pursuant to the Highams EMI Share Option Scheme. 
The options were granted by Remcom on 30 March 2007; this being
the last business day of the year, the share price at the year end was
5.125p. The options will vest subject to the audited gross profit figure
of the Group for the financial year ended 31 March 2008 being in
excess of £600,000 greater than the audited gross profit figure of the
Group for the financial year ended 31 March 2007 . In the event that
the above gross profit figure to 2008 is not achieved, one third of the
options shall instead vest on an increase in gross profit of £500,000 
or more. Vested options are exercisable at any time between 30 March
2010 and 30 March 2017 .
If the target of a £600,000 increase in gross profit is achieved, a cash
bonus of £50,000 will be paid. If the gross margin in the period increases
by more than £600,000, the cash bonus described above will be
increased by 25% of the gross margin in excess of £600,000.
If the target of a £600,000 increase in gross margin is not achieved,
but an increase of at least £500,000 is achieved, a cash bonus of
£16,500 will be paid.
Pensions The Group operates a defined contribution pension scheme, the
contributions to which are set out in note 5 to the financial statements.
Service Contract Of the executive directors, EI Andrews has a service
agreement terminable by the Company by not less than twelve months’
notice or by the executive at not less than six months’ notice. D Pye
has, and MA Eve had, an agreement that can be terminated on six
months’ notice. GD Burbidge had a service agreement terminable by
the Company by not less than twelve months’ notice or by the
executive at not less than six months’ notice.
Non-Executive Directors Non-executive directors receive an annual fee
in respect of their duties. The fees are reviewed annually and are set by
the board. Their contracts are immediately terminable.

Directors’
Remuneration
Report Report of the independent auditors to the shareholders of
Highams Systems Services Group plc.
We have audited the group and parent company financial statements
(the ''financial statements'') of Highams Systems Services Group plc for
the year ended 31 March 2007 which comprise the Consolidated Profit
and Loss Account, the Consolidated and Company Balance Sheets, the
Consolidated Cash Flow Statement, the Consolidated Statement of
Total Recognised Gains and Losses, and the related notes. These
financial statements have been prepared under the accounting policies
set out therein.
Respective responsibilities of directors and auditors
The directors’ responsibilities for preparing the financial statements 
in accordance with applicable law and United Kingdom Accounting
Standards (United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice)
are set out in the Statement of Directors’ Responsibilities.
Our responsibility is to audit the financial statements in accordance with
relevant legal and regulatory requirements and International Standards
on Auditing (UK and Ireland).
We report to you our opinion as to whether the financial statements
give a true and fair view and have been properly prepared in
accordance with the Companies Act 1985 and whether the information
given in the Directors’ Report is consistent with those financial
statements. We also report to you if, in our opinion, the company has
not kept proper accounting records, if we have not received all the
information and explanations we require for our audit, or if information
specified by law regarding directors' remuneration and other
transactions is not disclosed.
We read other information contained in the annual report and consider
whether it is consistent with the audited financial statements. This other
information comprises only the Directors’ Report, the Chairman’s 
Statement, the Chief Executive’s Report, the Statement of Corporate
Governance, the Directors’ Remuneration Report, the Operating and
Financial Highlights and the Five Y ear Record. We consider the
implications for our report if we become aware of any apparent
misstatements or material inconsistencies with the financial statements.
Our responsibilities do not extend to any other information.
Our report has been prepared pursuant to the requirements of the
Companies Act 1985 and for no other purpose. No person is entitled
to rely on this report unless such a person is a person entitled to rely
upon this report by virtue of and for the purpose of the Companies Act
1985 or has been expressly authorised to do so by our prior written
consent. Save as above, we do not accept responsibility for this report
to any other person or for any other purpose and we hereby expressly
disclaim any and all such liability.
Basis of audit opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on
Auditing (UK and Ireland) issued by the Auditing Practices Board. An
audit includes examination, on a test basis, of evidence relevant to the
amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. It also includes an
assessment of the significant estimates and judgments made by the
directors in the preparation of the financial statements, and of whether
the accounting policies are appropriate to the Group’s and Company's
circumstances, consistently applied and adequately disclosed.
We planned and performed our audit so as to obtain all the information
and explanations which we considered necessary in order to provide us
with sufficient evidence to give reasonable assurance that the financial
statements are free from material misstatement, whether caused by
fraud or other irregularity or error. In forming our opinion we also
evaluated the overall adequacy of the presentation of information in 
the financial statements.
16 | HIGHAMS R&A.2007
Report of 
the Auditors Opinion
In our opinion: 
4 the group financial statements give a true and fair view, in
accordance with United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting
Practice, of the state of the Group’s affairs as at 31 March 2007
and of its loss for the year then ended;
4 the parent company financial statements give a true and fair view, in
accordance with United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting
Practice, of the state of the parent company's affairs as at 31 March
2007;
4 the financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance
with the Companies Act 1985; and
4 the information given in the Directors’ Report is consistent with the
financial statements.

Financial Statements
for the year ended 31 March 2007
1. Accounting Policies
Accounting convention
The accounts have been prepared under the historical cost convention and in accordance with applicable accounting standards. 
Basis of consolidation
The Group financial statements consolidate the financial statements of the Company and its subsidiary undertakings using the acquisition
method of accounting.
The results of subsidiary undertakings acquired are included from the date of acquisition. The results of subsidiary undertakings disposed
of are included up to the date of disposal, and the net profit or loss on disposal is calculated based on the net proceeds receivable and the
net assets at the date of disposal, including any unamortised goodwill.
Turnover
Turnover represents amounts receivable for services provided during the accounting period net of trade discounts and value added tax.
Revenue in respect of contract placements is recognised in the period in which the contractor undertakes the work. Revenue in respect 
of permanent placements is recognised in the period in which a placement commences work.
Goodwill
Goodwill arising on the acquisition of subsidiary undertakings is carried on the balance sheet and amortised over its useful economic life 
of ten years. The carrying value of goodwill is reviewed regularly for impairment. On subsequent disposal of the underlying investment, any
goodwill not yet amortised will be taken to the profit and loss account when calculating the profit or loss on disposal.
Tangible fixed assets and depreciation
Tangible fixed assets are stated at cost net of depreciation and provision for impairment. Depreciation is provided on all tangible fixed
assets at rates calculated to write off the cost, less estimated residual value, of each asset over its expected useful life as follows:
Leasehold improvements – over period of lease
Computer equipment – 50% on cost per annum
Furniture, fittings and office equipment – 25% on cost per annum
Motor vehicles – 25% on written down value per annum
Investments
Investments are shown at cost less provision for impairment.
Finance and operating leases
Assets held under finance leases or hire purchase agreements are capitalised in the financial statements and depreciated over their
estimated useful lives. Finance and hire purchase charges are charged to the profit and loss account over the period of the lease.
Rentals under operating leases, being leases which do not result in the transfer to the Group of substantially all the risks and rewards 
of ownership of the assets being leased, are charged to the profit and loss account on a straight line basis over the lease term. 
Deferred taxation
Deferred tax is recognised in respect of all timing differences that have originated but not reversed by the balance sheet date except for
deferred tax assets which are only recognised to the extent that the company anticipates making sufficient taxable profits in the future to
absorb the reversal of the underlying timing differences.
Deferred tax balances are not discounted.
22 | HIGHAMS R&A.2007 Foreign currency
Transactions in foreign currencies are recorded at the rate of exchange at the time of the transaction. Monetary assets and liabilities
denominated in foreign currencies at the balance sheet date are reported at the rates of exchange prevailing at that date or, if appropriate,
at the forward contract rate. Any gain or loss arising from a change in exchange rates subsequent to the date of the transaction is included
as an exchange gain or loss in the profit and loss account. 
Foreign currency (on consolidation)
The results of overseas operations are translated at the average rates of exchange ruling during the period and their balance sheets at the
rates ruling at the balance sheet date. Exchange differences arising from this policy are dealt with through reserves.
Pension costs
The Group operates a defined contribution pension scheme. The pension cost charged to the profit and loss account represents
contributions payable by the Group to the pension scheme in the year. Differences between contributions payable in the year and
contributions actually paid are shown as either accruals or prepayments in the balance sheet. 
Financial instruments
In relation to the disclosures made in note 14:
– short term debtors and creditors are not treated as financial assets or financial liabilities (other than for currency disclosures);
– the Group does not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading purposes.
Employee share benefit trust
The cost of the Company's shares held by the employee share benefit trust is deducted from shareholders' funds in the company and
consolidated balance sheet. Any cash received by the employee share benefit trust on disposal of the shares it holds is also recognised
directly in shareholders' funds. Other assets and liabilities of the employee share benefit trust, (including borrowings) are recognised as
assets and liabilities of the company. Any shares held by the employee share benefit trust are treated as cancelled for the purposes of
calculating earnings per share.
Share-based payments
Where share options are awarded to employees, the fair value of the options at the date of grant is charged to the income statement 
over the vesting period. Non-market vesting conditions are taken into account by adjusting the number of equity instruments expected 
to vest at each balance sheet date so that, ultimately, the cumulative amount recognised over the vesting period is based on the number
of options that eventually vest. Market vesting conditions are factored into the fair value of the options granted. As long as all other vesting
conditions are satisfied, a charge is made irrespective of whether the market vesting conditions are satisfied. The cumulative expense is
not adjusted for failure to achieve a market vesting condition.
Where the terms and conditions of options are modified before they vest, the increase in the fair value of the options, measured
immediately before and after the modification, is also charged to the income statement over the remaining vesting period.

14. Derivatives and other financial instruments
The Group’s financial instruments comprise borrowings, cash and items such as trade debtors and creditors that arise as a result
of normal operations. The Group does not trade in financial instruments.
The main risks arising from the Group's financial instruments are interest rate risk and foreign currency risk. The board reviews and
agrees policies for managing each of these risks and they are summarised below. 
Interest rate risk
The Group finances its operations through a mixture of retained profit, bank borrowings and invoice discounting. The Group
borrows in pounds sterling and euros. The board reviews interest rates on potential borrowings although during the period the
Group was not exposed to significant interest rate risk.
Interest rate profile
Cash deposits are non-interest bearing unless placed on money markets at overnight rates. The invoice discounting facilities are
charged at 1.65% above the UK base rate.
Foreign currency risk
The Group trades within Europe. Transactions in Europe are generally priced and invoiced in euros. 
Currency exposures
The table below shows the Group's currency exposures. Such exposures comprise the monetary assets and monetary liabilities of
the Group that are not denominated in its functional currency of the operating unit concerned. These exposures were as follows:
Euro Total
£'000 £'000
31 March 2007 208 208
31 March 2006 88 88 
Maturity of financial liabilities
The overdraft facility is repayable on demand. 
Borrowing facilities
The Group has an overdraft facility of £1,000,000 gross (net nil) (2006: gross £1,000,000 (net nil)) and a confidential invoice
discounting facility of £1,750,000 (2006: £1,750,000). Both facilities are Group cross guaranteed. At 31 March 2007 
the Group's use of the combined facilities was £591,000 (2006: £300,000).
Fair values
The fair values of the financial assets and liabilities at 31 March 2007 and 31 March 2006 are not materially different from 
their book values.
15. Provision for liabilities and charges
A deferred taxation asset has not been created because tax losses carried forward are not expected to be relieved in the
foreseeable future.
The deferred tax asset not being recognised is valued at £418,427 (2006: £362,388).

21. Employee Share Schemes
(a). Approved Employee Share Option Scheme
The Company adopted an HM Revenue & Customs approved Executive Share Option Scheme on 17 May 1996. At 31 March
2007 all options previously granted have lapsed. The number of options in existence at 31 March 2006 was 141,068, and the
weighted average exercise price was 95p. The scheme terminated on 17 May 2006, without any options being exercised. 
(b). Unapproved Employee Share Option Scheme 
The Company adopted an Employee Share Option Scheme on 15 November 1995 which is not approved by HM Revenue 
& Customs. Under the terms of this scheme, certain employees of the Company were granted options over ordinary shares. 
The number of options in existence at 31 March 2006 was 19,331, and the weighted average exercise price was 80p.
All options previously granted have lapsed. 
(c). EMI Option Scheme
The Company adopted an EMI (Enterprise Management Incentive) scheme and granted 779,220 shares as at 8 September 2000.
All of these options had lapsed prior to the beginning of the year.
HIGHAMS R&A.2007 | 33 Notes to the 
Financial Statements
for the year ended 31 March 2007
21. Employee Share Schemes continued
The scheme was amended with effect from 29 March 2007 in order to reflect legislative changes since the scheme's creation.
Options over 1,931,700 ordinary shares were granted on 30 March 2007 at an exercise price of 5.125 pence per share. These
options will vest in full if the gross profit of the Group for the year ended 31 March 2008 exceeds the gross profit for the year
ended 31 March 2007 by £600,000 or more. If this increase in gross profit is not achieved, one third of the options will instead 
vest on an increase in gross profit of £500,000 or more over the same period. The options will lapse to the extent that these
performance targets are not achieved. Vested options are exercisable after 30 March 2010.
Valuation
Options were valued by using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. No performance conditions were included in the fair value
calculations; the relevant options are not subject to total shareholder return performance conditions. The fair value per option
granted during the year and the assumptions used in the calculation are as follows:
Grant date 30 March 2007
Share price at grant date 5.125p
Vesting period 3 years
Expected volatility 65%
Option life 10 years
Expected life 3.5 years
Risk free rate 5.2986%
Dividend yield 0%
Fair value per option 1.776p
The expected volatility is based on historical volatility since January 2000. The expected life is the expected period to exercise. 
The risk free rate of return is the UK Gilts rate on date of grant consistent with the assumed option life.
Given that the options were not granted until 30 March 2007, the charge to the profit and loss account for the year is £30
(2006: £nil).
(d). All Employee Share Ownership Plan
The Company has adopted an HM Revenue & Customs approved share scheme in which no shares had been granted as at 
31 March 2007.
(e). Employee Share Benefit Trust
An Employee Share Benefit Trust was established in November 1995 and its Trustees have the power to grant options to eligible
employees over shares in the Company at the Trust’s expense, and the Company’s discretion, upon such terms as they think fit
and to purchase such shares to be acquired by the eligible employees. 
In accordance with UITF 38 the cost of shares acquired by the Trust are included in the sponsoring company's shareholders'
funds.
The Company did not make any contributions to the Trust during the year (2006: £nil). The Trust holds 183,953 shares in the
Company, with a market value of £9,428 (2006: 183,953 shares at a market value of £8,565). 
No shares have been transferred to employees or were under option as at 31 March 2007. The Trust’s only other asset at 
31 March 2007 was cash at bank of £2,368 (2006: £2,368) which is included in the Company’s balance sheet as part of cash 
at bank and in hand. The Trust had no liabilities.

09 Last year, we anticipated that the economies in which we
operate would be challenging and in fact the markets for
recruitment have proved the toughest on record. We are
positioned in one of the most cyclical sectors of the economy
and, as a result, many of our markets in the later stages of the
year were experiencing reductions in year-on-year demand
of over 40% as the economic downturn increasingly impacted
client and candidate conﬁdence. The business has adapted well
to these conditions, with all of our largest businesses remaining
very proﬁtable and cash generative. On a Group basis, we
protected proﬁts well and delivered an excellent cash ﬂow
performance. I think this ﬁnancial performance is testimony
to the decisiveness with which our management team acted
to reduce the cost base and the agility of our business model.

Chairman
BUILT TO WITHSTAND
TOUGH TIMES
* Continuing activities only, pre-exceptional items.
Whilst we are disappointed to report a 39% reduction in
earnings per share* for the year, we consider it a good result
in the current environment, and we believe we have achieved
one of the market-leading ﬁnancial performances in our sector.
Last year I also expressed my conﬁdence that Hays will emerge
from any downturn a more efficient business, with an increased
market share. Whilst dealing with short-term trading conditions
has been the priority this year, we have been careful not to lose
sight of these longer-term objectives. We have continued to
expand into new markets, which we believe present signiﬁcant
long-term opportunities, including entry into two of the world’s
largest economies: India and Russia. We have continued to
commit resources to areas of the market that have been
relatively resilient, particularly in the public sector, both in
the UK and Australia. Our ﬁnancial strength has enabled us to
protect our infrastructure in businesses that are at early stages
of development, particularly in Continental Europe and Asia.
As we set out later in this Annual Report, we have continued
to innovate through the downturn, reﬁning how we operate
and go to market, including the enhancements we have made
to our account management structure, training programmes
and branding. On the efficiency front, we have ring-fenced
our investment in upgrading our IT systems to ensure that
we will go into the economic recovery with the most capable
and efficient IT systems in our sector. Your Board has already
tasked the executive with preparing robust planning scenarios
to enable us to capitalise on an improvement in the global
economies, whenever that may occur.
Dividend
Our dividend policy is designed to support a sustainable
dividend across the economic cycle, whilst also delivering a
progressive dividend during periods of growth. In view of the
current economic conditions, the Board is proposing to hold
the ﬁnal dividend at last year’s level of 3.95 pence. This would
result in a full-year dividend of 5.80 pence (2008: 5.80 pence).
Board governance
The Board has met 10 times this year, which included two
overseas visits to the Group’s operations in Ireland and
Germany. In addition, the Board discussed the development of
our strategic priorities. These priorities focus upon developing
scale in key international markets, developing our use of IT for
competitive advantage, brand deployment and creative use of
web-based technologies. Our Board evaluation process is now beginning to demonstrate
its value to your Company, in that all directors feel that the
Board has become more effective in the last year and has
clear priorities going forward, centred on our people and skills,
further increasing the international component of the business
and driving efficiency. Fundamentally, we have little forward
visibility and so developing an organisation and culture that
is ﬂexible and agile is going to be a key component of our
future success, and Board time is being devoted to this
complex subject.
People
This has been a particularly tough year for our people. Many
have had to leave in order to match our resources to the market
and those remaining have had to accept additional roles and
responsibilities whilst experiencing a reduction in income from
the variable element of their pay.
As indicated through this Annual Report, our staff have
continued to apply themselves with energy and passion and,
on our many visits to our companies and offices, I have been
immensely impressed with their spirit and enthusiasm. Such
commitment and application bodes well for the future of the
Company. It is my privilege on behalf of the Board to express
our thanks to all our people around the world.
Corporate responsibility
Our approach to corporate responsibility encompasses a
broad range of philosophies, activities and standards, which
are provided in detail later in the Annual Report. Here, I would
like to single out our charitable work. As an organisation
we encourage and support our employees to participate in
a diverse range of charitable activities all over the world. For
example, in Australia we are involved in Camp Quality, which
provides activities for children with cancer. In New Zealand,
we support United Way, bringing together resources between
businesses and their local communities. In Germany, we
ﬁnance a doctor who works with children with cancer at a
major university hospital and support a number of initiatives
that further help children with cancer. In France, many of our
consultants were recently cycling around Paris to raise funds
for the Medical Research Foundation Against Breast Cancer.
In the UK this summer, around 40 of our employees hiked
26 miles across Yorkshire to raise money for charity. Over
the last three years, we have raised almost £500,000 in the
UK for the Marie Curie Cancer Care charity, which provides
support for terminally-ill patients. This year, some great
initiatives have been undertaken by our people, much in
their own time, to support charities that they have chosen.
I think these activities are a great example of the spirit that
pervades the Hays organisation.
Summary
Whilst I expect tough trading conditions to persist through
the next year, I am conﬁdent that the experience of our
management teams, our leading market positions, the early
actions we have taken to reduce the cost base, our ﬁnancial
strength and strategy of continuing to invest in the long term
position us well to deal with both the short-term challenges
and to capitalise on the longer-term opportunities ahead.

BALANCING
SHORT TERM
ACTIONS WITH
LONG TERM
INVESTMENT
We are balancing the actions taken
to protect current proﬁtability with
the investment required to build
leadership both now and in the
next cycle of growth. The recruitment markets this year have been the most
challenging on record. We responded early by rapidly adjust ing
the cost base, focusing on cash generation, redirecting resources
into more resilient markets and investing to grow market share.
This approach has delivered good levels of proﬁtability in a
difficult market environment combined with an excellent cash
ﬂow performance.
Addressing the cost base
During the year, we have carefully balanced short-term actions
to protect current proﬁtability with longer-term investment
to build our business. To address the short-term conditions,
we have cut costs signiﬁcantly, primarily by reducing global
headcount by 26%*** and consolidating a number of our
offices, principally in the UK & Ireland. These actions resulted
in our cost base at the end of the year being 24% below the
cost base at the start of the year. 
Investment
We have also invested in our business to grow market
share both in the short term and long term. Firstly, we
have defended infrastructure in businesses that are at early
stages of development, particularly in Continental Europe and
Asia, where the long-term growth opportunities are substantial.
Secondly, we have added resources into more resilient sectors
including Healthcare, Education, Oil & Gas, and Pharmaceutical
and the wider public sector where we see good opportunities
for growth. Thirdly, we have invested in our account management
infrastructure to increase our share of the large corporate
market. Fourthly, we have continued to selectively invest
internationally, starting operations during the year in India
and Russia.
Innovation
Having built an infrastructure that covers the globe, has
deep expertise across a wide range of skills and sectors and
is increasingly enabled by technology, we are now innovating
and developing ways to leverage that infrastructure to further
differentiate ourselves in the market. Whilst the core of our
business, helping our clients ﬁnd the experts they need for
their own businesses and helping candidates ﬁnd the right
role for themselves, will remain unchanged, we are developing
new ways of delivering our services. 
During the year, we launched a global resourcing service called
‘LOCATE’, which uses our international network to help ﬁnd and
attract skilled physicians and nurses for our clients from all over

provides a broad range of technology-driven communication
products and services, from candidate attraction, mobile
messaging and web-based recruitment, through to video
production and the use of social media. We are seeing high
levels of interest in these services and currently have around
200 bespoke client recruitment microsites online.
By having deep expertise across a wide range of job categories,
national and international coverage and an ability to source
temporary, permanent and interim staff, we are uniquely able
to provide a complete solution to our clients to cover all their
professional, qualiﬁed and skilled recruiting needs. To best
leverage this array of services, we continue to strengthen our
major accounts infrastructure. As a result, we have made good
progress in signing multi-specialism contracts with an increasing
number of large private and public sector organisations across
the world. Many of our clients are further beneﬁting from
our ability to manage their entire recruitment process on an
outsourced basis, providing them with greater levels of cost
control and transparency than via the more traditional in-house
recruiting model. For example, in the UK we recently signed a
10-year contract as exclusive partner to Buckinghamshire
County Council to recruit all their professional and skilled people
across a wide range of job categories. Our ability to combine the
management of a client’s recruitment process, with the delivery
of the skills they require across multiple disciplines, is a further
important differentiator for us.
Finally, we have made excellent progress rolling out our new IT
systems. These programmes are designed to give our global front
office the best database systems available, as well as automate
signiﬁcant portions of our UK back office administration. When
completed, we will have the best platforms in the industry, which
will make us more efficient and further enhance our services to
customers. I am pleased to say both programmes are on track
and are due for completion in 2010.
These are just some examples of the ways we are investing
in our business to build long-term differentiation with the aim
of ensuring that we are well positioned to take full advantage
when our markets improve. 
Strategy and priorities for 2010
Our underlying aim and strategy remains fundamentally
unchanged irrespective of the economic backdrop. Our
aim is to build the pre-eminent global business in specialist
recruitment. Our strategy for achieving this divides into four

components: improving operational effectiveness, developing
the best people in the industry, applying a ‘Hays way’ of doing
things consistently across the world, and growing our business
by replicating what we do geographically and sectorally.
For 2010, this strategy translates into the following key areas
of focus:
1. Cash, proﬁt and productivity maximisation
We will continue to deal with challenging short-term trading
conditions by focusing on proﬁt, productivity and cash ﬂow
maximisation. This will require continued close control of the
cost base, reducing it further where necessary. However, we will
be cautious about reducing costs further in those parts of our
business where operations are at an early stage of development
or where we see the need to retain infrastructure to allow us to
rapidly build a market-leading position once the market stabilises.  2. Increase market share
We believe that recession provides a good opportunity for
ﬁnancially strong businesses like ours to increase market share.
Our broad capability means we can target resources on those
areas of the market that are both currently resilient and have
attractive long-term growth characteristics. Firstly, this means
continuing to invest in more resilient sectors like Healthcare,
Education, Oil & Gas, Pharmaceutical and the wider public
sector. Secondly, we will leverage our new account management
infrastructure to win more large corporate accounts. Thirdly, we
will continue to selectively invest in the international network
taking account of both current economic trends and long-term
opportunities. Fourthly, we will be ready to add resources into
the more cyclical sectors when we see signs of recovery in
our markets.
3. Complete rollout of IT systems
We are already half way through the rollout of our new front
office and back office IT systems. The priority this year is to
complete the rollout in 2010 and to start exploiting the systems
to their full advantage with the dual aim of improving customer
service and the efficiency of our business. As this process
approaches completion, we will start to shift our focus to
developing our online capability and presence: we are market
leaders in specialist recruitment and we want to fully develop
a powerful online presence that reﬂects this.
4. Strengthen our brand positioning
Market-leading companies have market-leading brands.
We want our brand to be synonymous with ‘Powering the
world of work’. To achieve this, we are refreshing our branding
to address areas where we have identiﬁed improvement is
needed. This Report is a reﬂection of some of the changes
we are already making. In addition, we plan to increase our
investment per head in training to ensure that our recruitment
consultants have the expertise in their sectors that our clients
and candidates demand. This will allow us to live up to our
promise of ‘Recruiting experts worldwide’.
Whilst we anticipate that 2010 will be another tough year
for our industry, we must not lose sight of the fact that many
of the markets in which we operate are at very early stages
of development and will provide us with substantial growth
opportunities over the long term. We will, therefore, continue
to take advantage of the downturn to build market share and
maintain our investment in a wide range of operational areas
to strengthen our business for the long term. Whilst current
market conditions persist, we will manage this balance, remaining
conﬁdent in the resilience of our business as well as excited
about how we will develop our business in the future.

Market drivers
The multiplier effect and cyclical growth
As positions are ﬁlled, new vacancies are automatically 
created generating a multiplier effect on demand. Hence
economic growth has a leveraged impact on our business.
Increasing deregulation
Deregulation, particularly in Continental Europe, is opening
up new markets for our services, generally making it easier
for us to operate and grow.
Cultural changes 
Increasing awareness and willingness to use specialist 
recruitment services in sectors and countries that,
historically, have not been familiar with specialist
recruitment services.
Structural skills shortage
Skill shortages means businesses are using our services to
help ﬁll highly-skilled roles.
Increasing flexibility demands
Increasing demand by employers and employees for 
ﬂexible employment is driving longer-term growth in the
temporary placement market.
Increasing job velocity
People are changing jobs more frequently, which will create 
a greater demand for our services.

In March 2009 we opened our ﬁrst Russian office in Moscow. We entered Russia
because it has the eighth largest economy in the world and a specialist recruitment
market that is at very early stages of development. Our business has successfully
replicated into countries as diverse as Brazil, Singapore, UAE, Hungary and Denmark
in recent years, and so we are very conﬁdent that it will take off in Russia too.

‘LOCATE’
Findinginternationalsolutions
tolocalmarketissues
In our Health and Social Care business, we have responded to structural
shortages of skilled physicians, nurses and qualiﬁed social workers in
most developed nations by launching a global resourcing service called
‘LOCATE’, which identiﬁes and attracts candidates from all over the
world. This year, we have recruited hundreds of healthcare professionals
from India, the EU and the Middle East into the UK and Australia. As
populations age, we expect the structural shortage of skilled physicians
in the more developed countries to become more severe and so we see
these services as a great source of long-term growth.

Managingallrecruitmentrequirements
Hays has partnered Abbey since 2004, managing all their recruitment needs.
Our onsite team provide end-to-end services, from candidate attraction, screening
and interviewing to onboarding. Last year we recruited around 6,000 people
for Abbey from administration staff to lawyers and accountants. We have not
only improved the quality of their recruitment, but we have also reduced their
recruitment costs. This year the contract was extended to include Santander’s
Alliance & Leicester and Bradford & Bingley operations.
CORPORATEACCOUNTMANAGEMENT
Upgradingcorporateaccountcapabilities
Our enhanced corporate accounts structure brings together all Hays’ capability
across multiple specialisms, in both temporary and permanent placement markets,
into one point of contact for large public sector and private sector clients. This year
in the UK, we have recently won a contract with Buckinghamshire County Council to
source all their skilled recruitment over the next 10 years, which will involve 1000s
of hires every year. In Australia, we have been selected as a preferred supplier across
multiple specialisms for Westpac Group and ANZ Bank, which are two of the largest
banks in the country. In Singapore and Hong Kong, we have been appointed
preferred supplier to all GE’s businesses.
‘HAYSLEADERSHIP’
Providingexpertcareercounselling
‘Hays Leadership’ works alongside the National College for School Leadership
providing career opportunities and counselling to headteachers. Over the last
two years, we have advised 1,200 potential headteachers and placed hundreds
into new roles. Overall in the UK, our Education recruitment business has grown
by more than 40% over the last two years and we are now one of the top three
leaders in this market.

Hays Digital & Creative provides a broad range of technology-driven communication
products and services, from candidate attraction, mobile messaging and web-based
recruitment, through to video production and the use of social media. We are seeing
high levels of interest for these services. For example, this year we have built 330
bespoke recruitment microsites for our clients across 20 countries. Hays Digital &
Creative has recently built a microsite for the Greater Gorgon Gas Fields Project,
recruiting experts from around the world to work on Australia’s largest natural
resources project.

67% 33% In the United Kingdom & Ireland, net fees declined by 27%
to £330.7 million, with operating proﬁt down 54% to £63.5
million. Permanent placement net fees decreased by 40% as
market conditions deteriorated in our private sector markets.
Temporary placement net fees decreased by 15%, with most
of the decline in the second half of the year. The underlying
temporary placement margin was broadly in line with last year.
The conversion rate declined from 30.3% last year to 19.2%.
Across all our specialisms, activity in the private sector
was impacted considerably by reduced client and candidate
conﬁdence, and net fees declined by 37% versus prior year.
Our public sector businesses, which represented 33% of the
United Kingdom & Ireland net fees, achieved growth of 5%
in the year, although fees declined in the second half. This
performance resulted from our decision taken 18 months ago
to redirect resources towards the public sector and increase our
focus on leveraging our nationwide coverage and public sector
expertise, in order to take share in this part of the market.
We have continued to take action to address the falls in demand.
We have reduced our headcount by 26%*** over the past 12
months and have closed a total of 43 offices in the year as
we have sought to consolidate office space. We have made
excellent progress on our investment programmes with
over 80% of our temporary workers now paid online (versus
25% at the end of last year) and our back office automation
project remains on track to complete by June 2010. We have
successfully rolled out our new front office system into half of
our United Kingdom & Ireland businesses. We have enhanced
our market offering, both in our national corporate accounts
and recruitment outsource services, and these investments
have yielded several important client wins, particularly in
the public sector and ﬁnancial services sector. These actions
are designed to ensure that the business is in the strongest
possible position to deal with current market conditions and
to take advantage when markets recover.
As we stated in our Half Year Report, HM Revenue & Customs
withdrew the staff hire concession from 1 April 2009. This change
has made the cost of temporary workers more expensive for
a number of our clients who are unable to reclaim VAT and we
estimate that, to date, this has resulted in a reduction of around
800 temporary workers hired through Hays or around £5 million
in net fees per annum. This represents less than 2% of total
United Kingdom & Ireland net fees.

(29% on a like-for-like basis*) to £61.4 million. The difference
between actual growth and like-for-like growth was mainly due
to the appreciation in the Australian Dollar. The business again
achieved a strong conversion rate of 41.2% in the year, although
this was lower than the 47.3% achieved last year.
In our market-leading Australia & New Zealand business there
were contrasting performances between the permanent and
temporary placement businesses. Temporary placement net
fees decreased by 3%* in the year following a good ﬁrst half
and resilient second half performance. The permanent placement
business saw much tougher market conditions with net fees down
35%*. Overall, total net fees in Australia & New Zealand decreased
by 20%* in the year. The public sector accounts for 23% of net
fees in Australia & New Zealand and provided good growth,
increasing net fees by 4%* versus last year, although this market
weakened towards the end of the year. IT remained the most
resilient sector, with net fees down 10%*, whereas Accountancy &
Finance, Construction & Property and Resources & Mining were
each impacted signiﬁcantly by the economy. After a strong start
to the year, our businesses in Asia saw fees decrease by 17%* 
in the year, with Singapore proving to be the most resilient
business with fees increasing by 13%*. The Asian markets
represent an excellent source of long-term opportunity for 
Hays and hence we remain committed to maintaining our 
office network in the region. 
We have responded quickly to changes in market conditions
across the region by reducing headcount by 36% in the year.
As part of our strategy of continuing to selectively expand our
geographical footprint, we started operations in the Northern
Territory in Australia with an office opening in Darwin.

21% (5% on a like-for-like basis*) to £191.0 million and operating
proﬁt remained ﬂat (but decreased by 16% on a like-for-like
basis*) at £33.1 million. The difference between actual growth and
like-for-like growth was predominantly due to the appreciation
in the Euro. 
The division experienced a signiﬁcant weakening in its markets
in the second half of the year, which was reﬂected in the net fee
growth rate of 27%* in the ﬁrst half falling to a 13%* decline in
the second half, versus the same period last year. We responded
rapidly by reducing consultant headcount by 17% during the
year. The conversion rate decreased to 17.3% (2008: 21.0%)
as a result of the marked fall in net fees in the second half.
Our German business, representing 46% of the division’s net
fees and nearly all the region’s proﬁt in the year, achieved a
strong performance, increasing net fees by 19%*. This business
focuses predominantly on the IT contracting market, which has
been relatively resilient in the downturn so far, although demand
was falling in the ﬁnal quarter. Our strategy to diversify Germany
into a broader range of specialisms, including Accountancy &
Finance, Construction & Property, Legal and Pharmaceutical,
also contributed to this excellent result and these newer
specialisms now account for 16% of total net fees in Germany. 
Our other businesses in this division, covering 19 countries,
are focused principally on the permanent placement markets
and, hence, were more exposed to the impact of the economic
downturn. We responded to falling demand by reducing the
consultant headcount collectively in these countries by 24%
in the second half of the year. 
We view our international businesses as central to our strategy
of positioning Hays to capitalise on the substantial long-term
structural growth opportunities that exist in these markets,
cognisant of the fact that most of these businesses were
achieving annualised organic growth rates in excess of 40%*
before the economic downturn. Consequently, we will be very
cautious about reducing the cost base further in countries
where our operations are at an early stage of development.

CASH FLOW 
PERFORMANCE
£260.9 million cash ﬂow generated
from operations, representing 165%
conversion of operating proﬁt into
operating cash ﬂow.
28 Hays plc Annual Report & Financial Statements 2009 The performance of the Group has been impacted by deteriorating
conditions in all our markets, particularly in the second half of
the year. Group turnover decreased by 4%, net fees decreased
by 15% (declining by 18% on a like-for-like basis*), and operating
proﬁt decreased by 38% (40% on a like-for-like basis*). The
results beneﬁted from exchange rate movements, principally
the Euro and Australian Dollar, which increased net fees by
£34.7 million and operating proﬁt by £9.5 million.
The Group experienced much tougher market conditions in the
second half of the year compared to the ﬁrst half. As a result,
net fees fell from £383.7 million in the ﬁrst half to £287.1 million
in the second half and operating proﬁt fell from £105.1 million
to £52.9 million. 
Net fees in the permanent business, representing 44% of Group
net fees, declined by 29%*, with permanent placement volumes
decreasing by 35% as a result of difficult market conditions
across all of our permanent placement markets. Average fees
per placement increased by 8%* compared to last year, due to
a favourable change in mix.
The temporary placement business, representing 56% of Group
net fees, was more resilient with net fees decreasing by 7%*.
This represented a volume decrease of 6%, and a 10 basis point
decrease in the underlying temporary margin to 16.8% (2008:
16.9%)***. The temporary placement business achieved growth
in the ﬁrst half of the year, but volumes fell in the second half
as demand weakened. The relative resilience of the temporary
placement business, against such a difficult economic backdrop,
highlights the advantage of having leading positions in both
permanent and temporary placement markets.

*** The temporary placement gross margin is calculated as temporary placement net fees divided by temporary placement gross revenue. We have presented the underlying temporary margin

**** The change in consultants is shown on a closing basis, comparing 30 June 2009 versus 30 June 2008. Consultant headcount is adjusted for the reclassiﬁcation of 49 consultants within Asia
Paciﬁc to non-consultant employees as at 30 June 2008. The reduction in net fees and the impact of tightening demand
on productivity levels caused the Group’s conversion rate,
which is the proportion of net fees converted into operating
proﬁt, to decrease from 32.3% last year to 23.6% this year.
The conversion rate decreased across the year as market
conditions became tougher and, as a result, the conversion
rate in the second half of the year was 18.4%. We responded
rapidly to these worsening market conditions by cutting costs
signiﬁcantly, including reducing headcount by 26% in the year.
We also closed a total of 48 offices (net of openings) in the
year, principally in the United Kingdom & Ireland, reducing the
total office network to 345 offices. Most of the cost reduction
has been achieved through natural attrition, performance
management and selectively exiting offices when leases expire.
However, we have incurred some restructuring costs during
the year totalling £8 million across the Group. These costs have
been broadly offset by the release of long term incentive plan
accruals following the reduction in proﬁt levels.
As a result of these cost measures, the Group’s cost base at
June 2009 versus June 2008 has been reduced by 24%, at
constant currency, which represents an annualised cost saving
of c.£140 million. Currently, we are continuing to maintain close
control of the cost base, reducing it further where necessary.
Our ability to deliver signiﬁcant levels of proﬁts in our main
businesses, despite the tough trading environment, underlines
the ﬂexibility of our cost base, the calibre of our management
and strength of the Group’s operating model.
Net ﬁnance charge
The average interest rate paid during the year ended 30 June
2009 was 3.2% (2008: 6.1%), generating a net interest payable
on bank balances of £3.5 million (2008: £7.2 million). There
was a net interest charge on pension obligations of £2.4 million
(2008: £3.0 million credit), mainly due to the lower return on
scheme assets, and a charge for the Pension Protection Fund
Levy of £1.1 million (2008: £0.5 million). Overall, the net ﬁnance
charge for the year was £7.0 million (2008: £4.7 million). It is
expected that the net ﬁnance charge in 2010 will increase to
around £15 million mainly due to a lower expected return on
scheme assets increasing the net interest charge on the pension
obligations and an expected increase in net interest charge on
bank balances.
Taxation
Tax on continuing operations for the year was £45.2 million,
representing an effective tax rate of 29.9% (2008: 29.0%). The
increase in the effective tax rate versus 2008 was mainly a result
of the changing geographical mix of proﬁts. It is anticipated that
the effective tax rate will increase further in 2010.
Earnings per share
Basic earnings per share from continuing activities decreased
39% to 7.72 pence (2008: 12.59 pence**). The fall in earnings
per share resulted from the reduction in proﬁt after tax, being
44% below last year’s result, partially offset by the favourable
annualised impact of the accretion from the prior year’s share
buy-back programme.
Cash ﬂow and balance sheet
Net cash generated by operations was £260.9 million (2008:
£256.0 million), representing a 165% conversion of operating
proﬁt into operating cash. This strong cash ﬂow performance
represents the highly cash-generative nature of our business
model, the unwind of working capital and the emphasis that
our management places on strong cash management. Cash
inﬂow from working capital was £90 million, largely resulting
from the fall in temp fees in the second half of the year, and an
improvement in trade debtor days to 35 days (2008: 39 days),
which was an excellent performance given the deteriorating
economic backdrop. In addition, the Group received a one-off
cash inﬂow in June 2009 of £20 million following the withdrawal
of the staff hire concession, which has subsequently been paid

management information. out to other agencies after year end. Tax paid in the year
was £56.5 million. Net capital expenditure was higher at
£37.0 million, reﬂecting the expenditure on the Group’s key
IT projects. As these projects complete, capital expenditure is
expected to reduce to £25 million this year, before falling back
to historical levels in the following year. £79.3 million was paid
out in dividends, £2.7 million was paid out in net interest, and
£2.1 million was used to buy back shares in the ﬁrst quarter.
Net debt decreased from £81.1 million at the start of the year
to a net cash position of £0.7 million at the end of the year.
Following the payment of the proposed ﬁnal dividend the
Group will return to a net debt position.
The Group has a £460 million unsecured revolving credit facility
available, which expires in February 2011. The covenants in the
facility require the Group’s interest cover to be at least 4:1 and
its leverage ratio (net debt to EBITDA) to be no greater than 3:1.
The Group has signiﬁcant headroom within these covenants.
Capital structure and dividend
The Board’s current priorities for our free cash ﬂow are to fund
Group development, maintain the strength of the balance sheet
and to support a sustainable dividend policy. In the ﬁrst quarter,
we purchased 1.7 million shares at a total cost of £1.4 million
before suspending the share buy-back programme. 
The Board is proposing to pay a ﬁnal dividend of 3.95 pence per
share, equating to £54 million, which is in line with last year and,
if approved at the Annual General Meeting, will make a total
of 5.80 pence per share for the full year (2008: 5.80 pence).
The recommended dividend will be paid on 20 November 2009
to shareholders on the register at the close of business on
23 October 2009. 
Retirement beneﬁts
The Group’s pension liability under IAS 19 as at 30 June 2009
of £109.2 million (£78.6 million net of deferred tax) increased
by £21.1 million compared to 30 June 2008, primarily due to
the lower than expected return on scheme assets, partially
offset by an increase in the discount rate. During the year, the
Group made a cash contribution of £7.0 million into the deﬁned
beneﬁt scheme, which included £2.7 million additional funding
towards the pension deﬁcit. 
During the current ﬁnancial year, the deﬁned beneﬁt pension
scheme will undergo its triennial actuarial valuation as at
30 June 2009. It is expected that this valuation will lead to an
increase in the actuarial pension deﬁcit largely due to lower
asset values and changes in the expected long-term inﬂation
rate assumptions. As a result, Hays’ deﬁcit funding into the
pension scheme is expected to increase to between £10 million
and £20 million per annum.
Management changes
On 14 October 2008, Tim Cook was appointed Managing
Director of the United Kingdom & Ireland business, taking over
from Alistair Cox, Group Chief Executive, who had been acting
Managing Director since February 2008. Tim has held a number
of roles during his 21-year career at Hays, most recently as
Managing Director of the Construction & Property business
in the United Kingdom & Ireland.
Current trading
Currently we are seeing initial signs of stability in the United
Kingdom and Asia Paciﬁc markets although no indications of
recovery. The Continental European markets, which entered
the downturn later than the other regions, are still experiencing
deteriorating conditions. Whilst we anticipate that 2010 will be
another tough year for our industry, we will continue to take
advantage of the downturn to build market share and pursue
our investment plans to strengthen our operations for the
long term. We are managing the short term whilst investing
for the long term.
Treasury management
The Group’s treasury operations remain straightforward and
uncomplicated with Group operations ﬁnanced by retained
earnings and bank borrowings. The Group has a £460 million
revolving credit facility in place until February 2011 and it
uses this facility to manage its day-to-day working capital
requirements as appropriate. All borrowings are raised by the
Group’s UK-based treasury department, which manages the
Group’s treasury risk in accordance with policies set by the
Board. The Group’s treasury department does not engage in
speculative transactions and does not operate as a proﬁt centre.
Counterparty risk primarily arises from investment of any surplus
funds. The Group restricts transactions to banks and money
market funds that have an acceptable credit rating and limits
exposure to each institution.

Directors’ Report – Business Review
Financial Review continued
32 Hays plc Annual Report & Financial Statements 2009
“Our ability to deliver signiﬁcant levels of proﬁts in our 
main businesses, despite the tough trading environment,
underlines the ﬂexibility of our cost base, the calibre of our
management and strength of the Group’s operating model.” Macroeconomic environment
The performance of the Group has a very close relationship
and dependence on the underlying growth of the economies
of the countries in which it operates. This is mitigated in part
by maintaining:
• a balance of temporary and permanent recruitment in both
the public and private sectors;
• a broad exposure across multiple countries and sectors;
• a ﬂexible cost base that enables us to react swiftly to changes
in market conditions by increasing or reducing costs as
appropriate; and
• a strong balance sheet with manageable debt levels.
A key part of the Group’s strategy is to continue to grow the size
of its international businesses to reduce the Group’s reliance on
any one speciﬁc economy.
Competitive environment
The Group continues to face competitor risk in the markets where
the provision of permanent and temporary recruitment is most
competitive and fragmented: the UK & Ireland and Australia &
New Zealand. There is strong competition for clients and
candidates and we face pricing and margin pressures in our
temporary business across our major specialist activities. The
Group’s strategy is to continue to grow its international businesses
in the less-developed markets of Asia Paciﬁc and Continental
Europe & Rest of World, whilst also improving the efficiency
and operations of our businesses throughout the organisation. 
Customer credit risk
The Group beneﬁts from close commercial relationships with key
clients in both the public and private sectors. The Group is not
reliant on any single key client in the private sector. However, the
Group is always subject to the risk that a large customer might
default on its payments, which might materially impact the
Group’s results. 
Contractual risk
Clients increasingly require more complex levels of compliance
in their contractual arrangements. In response to this, contracts
may either be allocated to dedicated teams, with audits
performed to reduce the risk of non-compliance or form part of
periodic review by Hays’ compliance and/or internal audit teams.
The Group also has clear guidance on the approval of contractual
terms and monitors the application thereof, especially any
exceptions to our standard liability position and insurance
protection, which require the approval of the Group Finance
Director. The placing of temporary workers generally brings
greater risk for the organisation than permanent placements.
Wherever possible, our contracts include provisions placing the
responsibility for supervision and control of the temporary
worker with the client, excluding any consequential loss and
limiting the Group’s aggregate liability under the contract.
People
The business is reliant on the ability to recruit, train and develop
people to meet the Group’s growth strategy. At the same time,
the Group’s business model demands ﬂexibility to consolidate or
expand, depending on the economic environment. In response
to this, the Group is focused on engaging with and developing
its leaders in each market. The Group is committed to providing
competitive pay and beneﬁts structures that are linked to
performance. Through training and development, it seeks to
provide individuals with the leadership, sales and key customer
management skills that support expansion needs, whilst providing
a rewarding career. 
Technology
The Group is increasingly reliant on delivering its service to
clients through a number of technology systems. These are
housed in various data centres and the Group has capacity
to cope with a data centre loss as a result of a signiﬁcant
event through the establishment of disaster recovery sites
that are physically based in separate locations to the ongoing
operations. The Group is also reliant upon a number of
important suppliers that provide critical information technology
infrastructure. It continually monitors the performance and
robustness of these suppliers to ensure business-critical
processes are safeguarded as far as is practicably possible.
The Group is in the process of replacing certain key operational
and ﬁnancial systems. Such changes have an element of
inherent risk. The Group has taken steps to mitigate these
risks by putting in place clear governance structures to review
project status, ensuring the necessary specialist resources are
available and by following a clear project management process.
Regulatory environment and legislative changes
The recruitment industry is governed by an increasing level of
compliance, which varies from country to country and market to
market. The Group takes its responsibilities seriously, is committed
to meeting all of its regulatory responsibilities and continues to
strengthen its internal controls and processes with respect to legal
obligations. As employment laws are changed and harmonised
in certain geographies, they bring with them new risks and
opportunities. The temporary market is more heavily regulated
and changes in legislation (e.g. the removal of the staff hire
concession and changes to temporary worker rights) may impact
the Group’s proﬁtability. The Group ensures that its policies,
processes and systems reﬂect best practice, where possible, and
meet the legal requirements of the markets in which it operates.
Foreign exchange
The Group has signiﬁcant operations outside the UK and
is therefore exposed to movements in exchange rates. As
proﬁts from the Australian and Euro-based markets increase
in proportion to the Group’s total proﬁts, the foreign exchange
risk also increases. The Group does not actively manage foreign
exchange risk through the use of ﬁnancial instruments but will
continue to monitor its policies in this area.
Pension scheme liabilities
The Group operates a deﬁned beneﬁt pension scheme, which
is now closed to new members. The scheme currently has an
accounting deﬁcit of £109.2 million as at 30 June 2009. During
the current ﬁnancial year, the scheme will undergo its triennial
actuarial valuation, which is expected to lead to an increase
in the actuarial pension deﬁcit and, therefore, the annual
cash contribution from the Group to reduce that deﬁcit.

Controlling discretionary spend is 
a priority, however this year we are
increasing our focus on people
development, as we view excellent
consultant training as non-discretionary. Dear shareholder
At Hays we play an important role in powering the world of work
by helping clients and candidates make the most of employment
opportunities. Each week around 250,000 people go to
Hays.com, our jobs portal, for advice and opportunities and, in
the past year, we placed around 320,000 people into temporary
and permanent roles across 28 countries and 17 specialisms.
Each of these placements represents a need satisﬁed for a
client, and a chance to build something new for a candidate.
We are proud of our role in this process. Our consultants build
a deep understanding of a client’s business and its culture,
to ensure we connect the right person to the right job at
every opportunity. We believe that a new employee can be
revitalising for a business, and for a candidate, a new job can
be a life-changing experience.
In this fast-paced world of business, it is sometimes easy to
forget that we play an integral role in the communities within
which we operate and live. Our people work hard for good
causes, supporting both charities and initiatives that play an
important part in the wider world of work. We lead a number
of employment programmes globally, using our expertise to
help job seekers improve their prospects and adapt to the

PEOPLE MAKING
A DIFFERENCE
difficult market conditions that they are currently experiencing.
Whether this be by sponsoring academic courses or working
with the unemployed to coach them on CV writing techniques,
Hays is working to share skills and knowledge with others.
I recently received a letter from the Chief Executive of Marie
Curie Cancer Care thanking us for raising almost £500,000
over the last three years in the UK. This impressive total was
contributed to by hundreds of people in their own way, all
showing that they wanted to be part of making a difference.
Globally across the Group we have similar success stories,
where our people are making a difference by supporting
various charities in their local markets.
As a signiﬁcant quoted company in the UK, we recognise
Hays’ broader role in setting a leading example in corporate
responsibility and we believe that it is an important contributor
to our strategic success. Customers increasingly expect
companies to conduct their business in a responsible way and
we recognise the ethical importance of managing the impact
of our business on people, the world and its resources. 
Climate change is rightly a concern for everyone. Although
Hays’ carbon footprint is small in relation to the size of our
business, we are committed to reducing our impact. We are
pleased that Hays plc is included in the FTSE4Good Global,
Europe and UK Indices, which provide tools for responsible
investors to identify and invest in companies that meet
globally-recognised corporate responsibility standards.
We touch many lives around the world and, as a result of
this, we have a long-standing commitment of conducting
our business in a responsible, ethical and sustainable manner.
We will continue to ensure that we address the issues that our
employees, clients, shareholders and other stakeholders view
as important.

Current corporate responsibility objectives Associated work programmes EMPLOYEES
Our business is entirely dependent upon our employees, not
only those who deal with clients and candidates, but also those
who support them. As a consequence, our people strategy is
focused on ensuring that we have the necessary capabilities,
resources and work environment appropriate for a 
high-performing organisation.
We want to attract, retain and develop the best people in the
industry to work for Hays. In order to achieve this, we have
focused on a number of key themes. In particular, 2009 has seen
signiﬁcant developments in the areas of employee engagement,
talent management and leadership development.
Employee engagement
Each year we receive a very good response to TALKback,
our employee engagement survey, that runs across all the
geographies in which Hays operates. 2009 was no exception,
with participation levels well in excess of 80% of employees
expressing their views and opinions in all aspects of their
workplace environment, our brand, our values, our leadership
and development activity and the work that we do for clients. 
Gathering our employees’ views enables us to understand
and monitor levels of engagement and highlight any areas
of concern that we need to address. Key drivers of employee
engagement in Hays are career development, leadership
and direction, culture and collaboration. Overall reported
engagement levels were good, at 77%, reﬂecting positive
responses to most of the items that make up this dimension.
Talent attraction, identiﬁcation and development
Our resourcing, training and development programmes
are designed to ensure that we have a pool of well qualiﬁed,
talented individuals, able to meet both the operational needs
of our business and our clients, as well as the future strategic
challenges facing the Company. We are committed to providing
our employees with opportunities to develop and grow their
skills, but we will also continue to bring in new capabilities
to the business through targeted, external recruitment. 
Employees are encouraged to take a proactive approach to
developing their careers. Employee training and development
takes many forms, from the more traditional classroom
teaching through to ‘lunch and learn’ sessions, e-learning, 
on-the-job coaching, development projects and secondments. 
KPI: Employee engagement
Employee engagement comprises a number of components that explore areas such as 
employees’ sense of belonging, discretionary effort, personal motivation and job satisfaction.
77% 2009
Additionally, Hays aims for all employees to have regular
discussions with their managers regarding their performance,
potential and individual development needs. 
Hays conducts an annual succession planning process to assess
the strengths and development opportunities of the Group at all
levels globally. The picture of Group succession is built bottom
up by specialism, country and region. Succession plans are
maintained for key areas of the business and are reviewed
annually by both management and the Board. 
Leadership development
The calibre of our leadership and management cadre is critical
to the success of our business. We have introduced the ‘Hays
Advance’ development programme and have been working
throughout the year to design the next phase of our leadership
activity. Under the auspices of the Waxman Scholarship, we are
ensuring our executive development activity is tailored and
aligned to the succession planning needs of the business. This
programme combines formal classroom training with coaching,
project-based work and action learning.
Values and behaviour
Hays believes that the way our employees work is just as
important as what they do in the workplace. To supplement
our leadership and management development activity, we
have focused on the behaviours and values that are important
to the way that we run the business. The Hays Leadership and
Management Competencies cover key areas of, and expectations
around, behaviour and are being embedded into our key,
people-related processes. 
Reward and recognition
We seek to reward and recognise people’s contributions to
the business appropriately, both as individuals and as a team.
Programmes to achieve this are cascaded through the
organisation to ensure that there is a focus on short-term and,
where appropriate, long-term performance. Senior executive
remuneration is linked to the Group’s annual and long-term plans,
which is described in the Remuneration Report on pages 56 to 66.
Diversity
Hays believes that diversity is a key driver of the organisation’s
effectiveness, both now and in the future. We actively encourage
different viewpoints, styles and approaches and are committed
to providing a workplace free from discrimination of any kind.
A notable success in this area has come in Australia, where we
were awarded the ‘Employer of Choice for Women’ status for
2009. Hays was the ﬁrst recruitment company to achieve this
award and the only one to achieve it consecutively for seven years.
This citation is awarded to non-government organisations that
have demonstrated policies and practices that support women
across the organisation and have had a positive outcome for both
women and the business. This award strengthens our competitive
edge and allows us to promote publicly our commitment to
recruiting, developing and retaining women at Hays.

Supporting Action for Children
Following on from the work we have
done with Marie Curie Cancer Care, our
focus in the UK is now on re-investing 
in the pool of resources from which we
draw as an organisation. In July 2009,
employees voted to support Action for
Children through fundraising, mentoring
and voluntary activities. We are pleased
to be a pioneer partner with Action for
Children’s employability programme, ‘Step Ahead’. We will be
providing strategic input and consultation along with several
other companies in the design of the programme, which is due
to be launched in 2010.
Prime Minister’s Global Fellowship
Hays China hosted two UK students as part of the UK Prime
Minister’s Global Fellowship, a high-proﬁle scheme that aims
to develop young British people’s global understanding, talent
and enterprise to engage successfully with other cultures and
business environments. The scheme was launched in 2008 and
is funded by the Department for Children, Schools and Families
(DCSF) in the UK. Hays China was able to give the students an
overview of how they operate locally and the various challenges
and beneﬁts of working globally. The two students worked
closely with a Hays mentor to help identify future development
goals and equip them with the necessary tools to secure
a career with a global company.
Charitable support
In the UK over the last three years we have supported one
major charity, Marie Curie Cancer Care, which was chosen
by UK employees. The charity provides care to around 25,000
terminally-ill patients in the community and hospices in the
United Kingdom, along with support for their families. In
the three years to June 2009, Hays raised a grand total of
£483,000, which will provide 24,150 hours of free nursing
care to patients with terminal cancer and other illnesses.
HAYS IN THE COMMUNITY
Hays plays an active role in the community by providing
an essential recruitment service for local people; ﬁnding the
right role for every candidate is one of the most important
objectives of the business. We also have a strong record
of contributing to these communities through employee
engagement, supporting local activities and good causes,
national fundraising activities for selected charities and, in
many of the countries where we have a presence, strategic
support for initiatives that beneﬁt the wider world of work.
Work in the community
Many Hays employees volunteer their expertise to help job
seekers and new entrants to the job market gain the skills to be
successful during the interview process and at work. In 2009, we
held enterprise days in schools, bringing team-building exercises
into the classroom and we also hosted career workshops
around the UK, providing essential CV writing advice and
practical interview training for job seekers. We operate similar
programmes in other countries.
We support the Chartered Institute of Building Services bursary
scheme by helping to fund a promising student through a
university degree course in a building services related ﬁeld.
Hays also sponsors numerous university awards to promote,
recognise and reward excellence in the ﬁeld of architecture.
Creating opportunities with the Prince’s Trust
As a member of the Prince’s Trust Construction & Business
Services Leadership Group, Hays Construction and Property
in the UK will be supporting the Prince’s Trust’s ‘Get into
Construction’ scheme. ‘Get into Construction’ is designed to
provide young people, especially those who have struggled
at school, are in care, are long-term unemployed or have
been in trouble with the law, with an opportunity to enter the
construction industry through increased skills and experience.
We are also assisting with the gratis placement of successful
graduates across the UK when they come to the end of
their courses. We have for several years supported a good cause in Germany
in the form of Waldpiraten (Forest Pirates) Camps, organised
by the German Childhood Cancer Foundation, which are held
in Germany, Austria and Switzerland. Hays makes a cash
contribution to the Waldpiraten campaign each time we place
a candidate. Continuing its social commitment to children with
cancer, Hays Germany also sponsors a paediatrician, Dr Soha
Asgari, within the oncology unit of a children’s hospital in
Heidelberg to assist the team in caring for the unit’s young
cancer patients.
In Australia, we continued our involvement with Camp Quality,
a children’s cancer charity using fun therapy to bring optimism
and happiness to the lives of children and families affected by
cancer. Camp Quality is known for its activity camps where
cancer takes a back seat to allow ‘the kids to be happy kids
again’. Hays Australia raised $130,000 in the year, $65,000 from
donations to be matched by $65,000 from Hays. This outstanding
effort has enabled us to fund camps for over 200 children.
Hays New Zealand continued its support for United Way, which
works alongside individuals and the community to provide
funding assistance, volunteer time and necessary skills to help
local human welfare charities. Hays New Zealand’s Managing
Director also volunteers his time by sitting on the Board of
Trustees of United Way.
To help build our community strategy, we are establishing a
network of Charity Forums in the countries where we have our
largest business presence. These Charity Forums will help us
to promote community engagement, support charity selection
and help co-ordinate and report our activities.
MANAGING THE ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT OF
HAYS AND ITS SUPPLIERS
Whilst our business has a low environmental impact, we
are committed to achieving continuous improvement in
environmental performance and to preventing pollution. We
seek to minimise our impact by reducing our use of energy,
water and raw materials, increasing efficiency and reusing
wherever possible.
Hays recognises that environmental initiatives do not work
in isolation. So we operate an environmentally-sensitive
procurement policy that encourages suppliers and contractors
to support our programmes and to minimise the impact of the
goods and services that they provide to us. Before we select
a new supplier, we establish through a questionnaire the
supplier’s policy, practice and targets in the areas of corporate
responsibility and environmental management. In the coming
year, we will introduce reviews of suppliers’ own assurance
reports, where available.
Actions taken under the Environmental Policy
Actions of particular note included:
• We promote recycling and the use of recycled materials and
we design energy efficiency into new services and offices and
manage energy efficiently in all operations. We use relatively
little space, with high office density and hot-desking the norm.
• In 2008, we joined the Green500 group, funded by the
London Development Agency, to help deliver the Mayor of
London’s target to cut London’s emissions by 60% by 2025.
During the year, we were awarded the Green500 Silver Award
in recognition of work undertaken since joining the scheme,
including our efforts in energy use reduction by aiming to
introduce PC power down systems to save 30% on our annual
fuel bills.

Promoting health and safety
It is the policy of Hays that all reasonably practicable steps
will be taken to ensure the health, safety and welfare of its
employees and the protection of others not in its employment.
Hays recognises its statutory obligations to maintain standards
of safety and its obligation to members of the public,
contractors and visitors.
Managers work to provide and maintain safe and healthy
working conditions, carry out suitable risk assessments of
all premises and tasks carried out within them and monitor
safety procedures. They involve employees, who are required to
co-operate fully in the operation of the health and safety policy.
The policy is reviewed annually and is revised appropriately
in the light of legislative or organisational changes.
Actions taken under the Health and Safety Policy
Actions of particular note included:
• We developed an online training course to promote
understanding, compliance and competency in health and
safety, and to reinforce our approach and embed policy
arrangements. The training course has now been launched
across the whole of the UK, with completion and pass rates of
94% and 89% respectively. We will be rolling this out globally.
• We continued our programme to roll out standard health and
safety induction material to new starters in overseas territories.
POLICIES THAT SUPPORT OUR BUSINESS AIMS
Our good conduct is a foundation for the trust our customers
place in us. We are a commercial organisation and we will
pursue the best possible economic return for our shareholders.
However, in making economic decisions, we have regard to the
impact of those decisions on other stakeholders, including
society and the environment.
Our business operates in accordance with the Combined Code
on Corporate Governance published by the Financial Reporting
Council. All Hays employees are aware of our Code of Conduct
& Ethics Policy (‘Code of Conduct’), which aims to ensure the
Company’s values are upheld. The Code of Conduct sets out
a number of behavioural principles, including:
• Hays employees are expected to communicate transparently
and honestly, within the legal framework of privacy
and conﬁdentiality.
• Our relationships with clients, candidates, employees,
business partners, suppliers and the communities within
which we operate are based upon respect for individuals
and their human rights.
• All Hays companies and employees are expected to adhere
to the highest ethical and legal standards in business dealings
throughout the world. Conﬂicts of interest that interfere with
proper performance or independent judgment, and offers or
acceptance of hospitality, gifts and bribes (including improper
offers or payments) that might appear to place third parties
or employees under an obligation, are prohibited.
• We pursue equality of opportunity and treatment and
diversity through our employment policies and encourage
our employees to reach their full potential through training
and development. We are committed to upholding the core
standards of the International Labour Organisation.
• We have a whistle-blowing policy that provides an
independent and conﬁdential process for raising concerns and
reporting any breaches of procedure through a conﬁdential
telephone hotline. 
Actions taken under the Code of Conduct
Actions of particular note included:
• The Audit Committee continued its monitoring of reports to
the conﬁdential telephone hotline during the year. Of the 14
calls to our conﬁdential hotline since its launch in July 2008,
11 involved employees seeking advice or information and three
involved circumstances requiring investigation, none of which
were material. We intend to increase employees’ awareness
of the hotline by further promotion in the forthcoming year.
• We carried out online competition law training for the second
year running. All fee-earning employees and their managers,
comprising approximately 4,300 individuals from around the
Group, completed the online course, achieving a completion
rate of 99.9%.
• In the UK, diversity awareness training was provided to key
managers to support the Group’s equal opportunities policy.
CONTINUOUS IMPROVEMENT
We will continue our programme of continuous improvement in
the area of corporate responsibility and we will seek to develop
the quality of our reporting year-on-year. In last year’s Corporate
Responsibility report, we said that we would review the metrics
we use to assess the success of our corporate responsibility
programme with the aim of identifying Key Performance
Indicators suitable for disclosure. We have approved one KPI for
disclosure in 2009: the Employee Engagement KPI stated in the
Employee section of this Report. We will keep the need for any
further KPI disclosures under review.

Remuneration Committee The Board of Hays plc is committed to the highest standards of
corporate governance and bases its actions on the principles set
out in the June 2008 Combined Code on Corporate Governance
(the ‘Code’) published by the Financial Reporting Council.
Further information on the Code can be found on the Financial
Reporting Council’s website, frc.org.uk.
The Financial Services Authority requires listed companies
incorporated in the UK to disclose how they have applied the
main principles set out in Section 1 of the Code and whether
they have complied with the principles in Section 1 throughout
the ﬁnancial year. This statement describes how the Company
applied the principles of the Code. 
Throughout the year ended 30 June 2009, the Company has,
without exception, complied with the provisions set out in
Section 1 of the Code. 
The Board 
The Board provides leadership and stewardship. The Board
comprises the Chairman, Chief Executive, Group Finance Director
and ﬁve independent non-executive directors. All directors
served throughout the ﬁnancial year. The biographical details
for all of the directors appear on page 45 and demonstrate the
Directors’ Report – Governance

Chairman 
range of experience and independent judgement they each
bring to the Board on all matters. 
The Board has a formal schedule of matters speciﬁcally
reserved for its decision, including the review of the ﬁnancial
results, material contracts, Group strategy, investor relations,
Board appointments, dividend recommendations, major capital
projects and acquisitions and disposals. The Board met 10 times
during the year. 
The Chairman, in conjunction with the Company Secretary,
plans the programme for Board visits to operations in the
UK and overseas and presentations from senior executives.
During the year, the Board visited the Company’s businesses
in Ireland and Germany, reviewing operations and receiving
presentations from local management on performance and
opportunities. The Board also received presentations from
other senior management within the Group.
The agenda for the Board and its Committee meetings is
considered by the relevant Chairman and issued with supporting
papers during the preceding week. For each Board meeting,
directors receive a Board pack, including monthly management
accounts, brieﬁng papers on commercial and operational
matters and major capital projects, including acquisitions. 
The attendance of those directors in place at the year end
at Board and Committee meetings held during the year was
as follows:

A procedure exists for the directors, in the furtherance of their
duties, to take independent professional advice if necessary,
under the guidance of the Company Secretary and at the
Company’s expense. All directors have access to the advice and
services of the Company Secretary, who is responsible to the
Chairman for ensuring that Board procedures are complied
with and that applicable rules and regulations are followed. 
On appointment, directors receive a formal induction, which
includes visits to relevant business units and functions and
discussions with senior management. These are tailored to
the individual needs of the directors and continue throughout
their tenure. Brieﬁng sessions on legislative and accounting
developments are held for the Board when appropriate. Board independence
The roles and responsibilities of the Chairman and Chief
Executive are separate. A formal division of each individual’s
responsibilities has been agreed and documented by the Board. 
The non-executive directors bring an independent view to the
Board’s discussions and the development of its strategy. Their
range of experience ensures that management’s performance
in achieving the business goals is challenged appropriately.
In conjunction with the executive directors, they ensure that
ﬁnancial controls and systems of risk management are both
rigorous and adequate for the needs of the business. 
All the non-executive directors are considered by the Board
to be independent as detailed in the Code. 
The letters of appointment for non-executive directors are
available for review at the Registered Office and prior to each
annual general meeting. A pro forma letter of appointment
is also available on the Company’s website, haysplc.com.
Under the Code, the Board appoints one of the non-executive
directors to act as Senior Independent Director whose main
responsibility is to be available to shareholders should they
have concerns that they have not been able to resolve through
normal channels, or when such channels would be inappropriate.
Mrs L M S Knox serves as the Senior Independent Director.
Board effectiveness
An external review of the Board’s effectiveness and the
effectiveness of its Committees was undertaken in 2007 by
Egon Zehnder. In 2008 and 2009 the Board conducted its own
reviews. The ﬁndings of the 2009 review have been considered
by the Board and certain actions will be implemented as a
result. The Chairman has met with the non-executive directors
individually, without the executive directors being present, to
consider the ﬁndings of the review. The Senior Independent
Director has also met with the other non-executive directors
to review the Chairman’s performance, having consulted
with the executive directors. This has enabled constructive
feedback to be given to each director. As part of the review,
the effectiveness of the Remuneration, Audit and Nomination
Committees was also considered. The Audit Committee also
undertook its own separate review reported on page 53. 
Following the review, the Chairman is satisﬁed that each of the
directors being put forward for re-election at the forthcoming
Annual General Meeting continues to be effective, that their
ongoing commitment to the role is undiminished and that
each non-executive director being put forward for re-election
continues to be independent.
Powers of directors 
The directors are responsible for the management of the
business and may exercise all powers of the Company subject
to legislation, any directions given by special resolution and
the Company’s constitution. 
haysplc.com 47
At the Annual General Meeting of the Company held on
12 November 2008, shareholders authorised the directors, until
the conclusion of the Annual General Meeting to be held on
11 November 2009, to purchase up to 206,364,799 Ordinary
shares of 1 pence each in the Company and to allot new shares
up to an aggregate nominal amount of £4,585,884, being
approximately one third of the Company’s issued share capital.
The authority to allot shares was not used. Renewal of both
authorities will be proposed to shareholders at the forthcoming
Annual General Meeting.
The Board intends to continue to return surplus cash to
shareholders where circumstances allow and it is not required
to ﬁnance the organic expansion of the business, acquisitions
and dividend payments, via the on-market purchase of its own
shares. Shares will only be purchased if to do so would result in
an increase in earnings per share and is in the best interests of
shareholders generally. No share purchases are anticipated in
the 2010 ﬁnancial year.
The Board will be seeking the approval of the shareholders to
renew this authority at the forthcoming Annual General Meeting
as detailed in the separate Circular to Shareholders. 
Appointment and replacement of directors 
The Company may by ordinary resolution appoint any
individual to the Board. The Board may appoint any individual
willing to act as a director either to ﬁll a vacancy or act as an
additional director. The appointee can only hold office until the
next annual general meeting whereupon he/she will be put
forward for election. 
The Articles of Association prescribe that there shall be no less
than ﬁve and no more than 15 directors. Should the number
reduce below ﬁve, then the Board shall, as soon as practical,
appoint an individual to ﬁll the vacancy. The Company may
by ordinary resolution vary the minimum number of directors. 
At each annual general meeting, not less than one third of the
directors must retire by rotation and any director who has been
in office for three years or more since his/her last appointment
or re-appointment must retire by rotation. A retiring director is
eligible for re-election. 
Responsibilities and membership of Board Committees 
The Board has agreed written terms of reference for the
Nomination Committee, Remuneration Committee and Audit
Committee. The terms of reference for all three Board Committees
are published on the Company’s website, haysplc.com, and are
also available upon request from the Company Secretary at the
Registered Office. 
Nomination Committee 
Mr R A Lawson chairs the Nomination Committee. Mrs L M S
Knox and Messrs C W Eccleshare, P S Harrison, R J Smelt and 
P H Stoneham were members of the Committee throughout the
year. The Chief Executive attends by invitation when appropriate.  whereby actual and potential conﬂicts of interest and duties
are advised to the Company Secretary and are reviewed
annually. Appropriate authorisations are sought for any 
ad-hoc notiﬁcations of any new conﬂicts of interest or duties,
or any changes to existing conﬂicts of interest or duties.
The Board has undertaken a review of these procedures and
considers them to have operated effectively during the year.
Internal control 
The directors are responsible for the Group’s system of internal
control and for maintaining and reviewing its effectiveness.
The Board has delegated responsibility for the review of the
Group’s internal controls to the Audit Committee. A review
has been completed for the year ended 30 June 2009 in
accordance with the recommendations of the Turnbull Report.
The Group’s systems and controls are designed to manage risks,
safeguard the Group’s assets and to ensure the reliability of
information used both within the business and for publication. 
Systems are designed to manage, rather than eliminate, the
risk of failure to achieve business objectives and can provide
only reasonable, and not absolute, assurance against material
misstatement or loss. The key features of the internal control
systems which operated throughout the period covered by the
ﬁnancial statements and up to the date of signing the accounts
are described below. 
Day-to-day responsibility for the management and operations
of the business has been delegated to the Chief Executive and
his Management Board, comprising the Group Finance Director,
Regional Managing Directors, the Group Human Resources
Director, the Group Marketing Director, the Group IT Director
and the Company Secretary (who is also the General Legal
Counsel). The Company Secretary also acts as Secretary to
the Management Board. Clear levels of authority exist for
the Management Board in their day-to-day activities. As far
as possible, the business units are given autonomy, whilst
operating within an established internal control environment,
as set out in the Group Policies and Procedures Manual. This
manual is designed to ensure that signiﬁcant risks, investment
decisions and management issues are escalated to Board level
at the earliest appropriate opportunity. The Group Policies and
Procedures Manual is updated on an ongoing basis to reﬂect
changes in procedures as and when they occur. The Group’s
Code of Conduct & Ethics Policy outlines the way in which
employees are expected to conduct themselves when carrying
out their business activities. 
Certain speciﬁc administrative functions are controlled
centrally by the Group. Taxation, treasury and insurance
functions report to the Board via the Group Finance Director.
The legal, compliance and health and safety functions report
to the Board via the Company Secretary. Procedures are clearly
deﬁned to ensure that the activities of these functions reduce

The Nomination Committee identiﬁes and selects candidates
in connection with any proposed new appointments of
directors and makes recommendations to the Board in
respect of such appointments. 
No new directors were appointed to the Board during the
ﬁnancial year. As part of the review of the effectiveness of
the Board and its Committees, during the year there was a
review of the composition of the Board to determine whether
it remained sufficient for the needs of the Company.
Remuneration Committee 
Mrs L M S Knox, an independent non-executive director,
chairs the Remuneration Committee. Messrs C W Eccleshare,
P S Harrison, R J Smelt and P H Stoneham were members of
the Committee throughout the year.
The Remuneration Committee determines, on behalf of the
Board, the remuneration and beneﬁts of the Chairman and
executive directors of the Company and monitors the levels of
remuneration and beneﬁts of selected senior managers of the
Group. In formulating its remuneration policy, the Remuneration
Committee gives full consideration to the matters set out in
Schedule A to the Code. The Group’s remuneration policy is
described in the Remuneration Report on pages 56 to 66. 
The Board as a whole determines the level of fees of non-
executive directors, after taking into account fees payable by
comparable companies and receiving external advice. There
has been no change to the fees of the non-executive directors
in the year. The fees were last reviewed in June 2008.
Audit Committee 
Mr P S Harrison chairs the Audit Committee. Mrs L M S Knox
and Messrs C W Eccleshare and P H Stoneham were members
of the Committee throughout the year.
The Audit Committee monitors the appropriateness of ﬁnancial
statements and announcements, monitors the relationship with
the external auditors and their independence and reviews the
Company’s internal controls and risk management systems. A
full report on the activities of the Audit Committee is included
on pages 52 and 53. 
Conﬂicts of interest
In line with the Companies Act 2006, the Articles of
Association were amended at the 2008 Annual General
Meeting to allow the Board to authorise actual and potential
conﬂicts of interest and duties that may arise and to impose
such limits and conditions as it thinks ﬁt. Conﬂicts of interest
and duties can only be authorised by those directors who do
not have an interest in the matter being considered, and in
making such decision, the directors must act in a way they
consider, in good faith, will most likely promote the success
of the Company. The Company has established a procedure the risk proﬁle of the organisation. An overview of the Group’s
treasury policy is set out on page 32. The Group has an ongoing
process for the identiﬁcation, evaluation and reporting of major
business risks, the results of which are outlined in the Principal
Risks statement on page 33. Progress on the management of
key issues is reported through the management structure to
executive management and to the Board. 
The Group operates a comprehensive budgeting and ﬁnancial
reporting process. Annual budgets are reviewed and approved at
business and Group level. This process includes the identiﬁcation
and quantiﬁcation of signiﬁcant risks relating to markets and
operations. Monthly performance is reported against budget
and prior year. The monthly management accounts analyse and
explain variances against budget and report on key indicators,
with detailed explanations for variances and movements in
forecasts provided to the Board. 
The Group has an Internal Audit department. The resources
of this department are focused on facilitating the identiﬁcation
of risks and carrying out review and testing of the controls in
place to mitigate them. The team’s resource is augmented with
independent expert external resources, wherever necessary, to
review risk and monitor compliance with the Group’s policies
and procedures. Regular reviews of the most important controls
are undertaken to ensure that key control objectives are achieved.
Reports on the effectiveness of operational and ﬁnancial controls
are regularly presented to executive management and to the
Audit Committee and recommendations are agreed upon
and implemented. 
The monitoring of control procedures is achieved through
review by executive management reporting to the Board. This
is supplemented by reviews undertaken by the Internal Audit
department of the controls in operation in the business units.
These processes have successfully been applied for the year
under review and up to the date of the approval of the Annual
Report and Financial Statements. 
This internal control statement has been reviewed and approved
by the Audit Committee.
Relations with shareholders 
The executive directors of the Company have a regular dialogue
with analysts and substantial shareholders. All non-executive
directors are aware of the programme of proposed visits and
are invited to attend. Investors are offered the opportunity to
meet the Senior Independent Director and the Chairman. 
Published broker reports are circulated to the Board which
considers any issues raised within them. The Group’s advisers
maintain a dialogue with major shareholders and after each
investor roadshow compile a report of shareholders’ views on
key issues and management performance. A summary of this
report is subsequently provided to the Board. 
The annual general meeting is used as an opportunity to
communicate with all shareholders. In addition, preliminary
results, half yearly results and quarterly interim management
statements are posted on the Company’s website, haysplc.com,
as soon as they are announced. Also, at least four times a year,
the Company hosts a teleconference for analysts and investors. 
The Notice of the Annual General Meeting to be held on
Wednesday, 11 November 2009, is contained in the separate
Circular to Shareholders and was either sent or made available
to shareholders at least 20 working days before the meeting.
Each substantially separate issue is proposed in the Notice
of Annual General Meeting as a separate resolution and
there are separate resolutions relating to the Annual Report
and Financial Statements and the directors’ Remuneration
Report. Furthermore, it is intended that the Chairmen of
the Nomination, Audit and Remuneration Committees will
be present at the Annual General Meeting. 
Restrictions on voting deadlines 
The notice of any general meeting shall specify the deadline for
exercising voting rights and appointing a proxy or proxies to vote
at a general meeting. It is the Company’s policy at present to take
all resolutions at a general meeting on a poll and the results of the
poll are published on the Company’s website, haysplc.com, shortly
after the meeting.

At the 2009 Annual General Meeting, a special resolution will
be put to shareholders proposing amendments to the existing
Articles of Association, primarily to accommodate provisions
contained in the Companies Act 2006 and the implementation
of The Companies (Shareholders’ Rights) Regulations 2009.
Details of the proposed amendments can be found in the
Notice of the 2009 Annual General Meeting. The Company’s
Articles of Association ordinarily can only be amended by
a special resolution at a general meeting of shareholders. 
Going concern 
The ﬁnancial statements have been prepared on the going
concern basis as the directors are satisﬁed that the Group has
adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the
foreseeable future. Further details can be found in note 2 to
the consolidated ﬁnancial statements on page 71.
Directors’ responsibilities 
The directors are responsible for preparing the Directors’
Report, the Remuneration Report and the ﬁnancial statements
in accordance with applicable law and regulations. Corporate
law requires the directors to prepare ﬁnancial statements
for each ﬁnancial year. The directors are required by the
International Accounting Standards (IAS) Regulation to
prepare the Group ﬁnancial statements under International
Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the
European Union. The Group ﬁnancial statements are also
required by law to be properly prepared in accordance with
the Companies Act 2006 and Article 4 of the IAS Regulation. 
IAS 1 requires that IFRS ﬁnancial statements present fairly
for each ﬁnancial year the Group’s ﬁnancial position, ﬁnancial
performance and cash ﬂows. This requires the faithful
representation of the effects of transactions, other events and
conditions in accordance with the deﬁnitions and recognition
criteria for assets, liabilities, income and expenses set out in
the International Accounting Standards Board’s ‘Framework
for the preparation and presentation of ﬁnancial statements’.
In virtually all circumstances, a fair presentation will be
achieved by compliance with all applicable IFRSs. However,
directors are also required to: 
• properly select and apply accounting policies; 
• present information, including accounting policies, in a manner
that provides relevant, reliable, comparable and understandable
information; and
• provide additional disclosures when compliance with the
speciﬁc requirements in IFRSs are insufficient to enable users
to understand the impact of particular transactions, other
events and conditions on the entity’s ﬁnancial position and
ﬁnancial performance.
The directors have elected to prepare the parent Company
accounts in accordance with United Kingdom Generally
Accepted Accounting Practice (United Kingdom Accounting
Standards and applicable law). The parent Company accounts
are required by law to give a true and fair view of the state
of affairs of the Company. In preparing these accounts, the
directors are required to:
• select suitable accounting policies and then apply them
consistently;
• make judgements and estimates that are reasonable and
prudent; and
• state whether applicable UK Accounting Standards have
been followed, subject to any material departures disclosed
and explained in the accounts.
The directors are responsible for keeping proper accounting
records that disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the
ﬁnancial position of the Company and enable them to ensure
that the parent Company accounts comply with the Companies
Act 2006. They are also responsible for safeguarding the assets
of the Company and hence for taking reasonable steps for the
prevention and detection of fraud and other irregularities. 
The directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity
of the corporate and ﬁnancial information included on the
Company’s website. Legislation in the United Kingdom
governing the preparation and dissemination of ﬁnancial
statements may differ from legislation in other jurisdictions. 
The Board conﬁrms to the best of its knowledge: 
• the consolidated ﬁnancial statements, prepared in accordance
with IFRS as adopted by the EU, give a true and fair view
of the assets, liabilities, ﬁnancial position and proﬁt of the
Group; and
• the Directors’ Report includes a fair review of the development
and performance of the business and the position of the
Group, together with a description of the principal risks and
uncertainties that it faces.

of the Committee and the Company Chairman, who is not
a member of the Committee, and they recommend new
appointments to the Nomination Committee for onward
recommendation to the Board. The Committee comprises
four independent non-executive directors and two members
constitute a quorum. 
Role of the Audit Committee 
The terms of reference of the Audit Committee are published
on the Company’s website, haysplc.com and are also available
from the Company Secretary at the Registered Office. 
The key responsibilities of the Committee are to: 
• monitor the appropriateness of the ﬁnancial statements and
formal announcements relating to the ﬁnancial performance
including any signiﬁcant judgements;
• recommend to the Board for approval by shareholders,
the appointment, re-appointment or removal of the
external auditors;
• monitor the relationship with the external auditors, including
consideration of their fees, the audit scope and the terms of
their engagement;
• review the effectiveness and objectivity of the external audit
as well as the external auditors’ independence;
• review the policy on engagement of the external auditors for
the provision of non-audit services and monitor compliance;
• review the Company’s internal controls and risk management
systems;
• monitor the effectiveness of the Company’s internal audit
function; and
• ensure the Company maintains suitable arrangements for
employees to raise concerns in conﬁdence.
Activities of the Audit Committee 
The Committee met four times during the ﬁnancial year
ended 30 June 2009. Attendance at meetings is shown on
page 46. 
During the year, the Committee discharged its responsibilities
as follows: 
Financial statements 
The Audit Committee reviewed the draft annual ﬁnancial
statements and half yearly report prior to recommending
their approval to the Board. The Committee discussed
with the executive directors and external auditors the
appropriateness of accounting polices adopted, signiﬁcant
estimates and judgements, whether the ﬁnancial statements
gave a true and fair view and the appropriateness of the going
concern assumption.

Paul Harrison 
Audit Committee Chairman External auditors 
The Audit Committee is responsible for recommending to
the Board for approval by the shareholders the appointment
of the external auditors. Deloitte LLP are the external auditors
of the Company, and under ethical guidance, they are required
to introduce a new audit partner every ﬁve years. The current
audit partner has been in place for three years.
In line with its terms of reference, the Committee undertakes
a thorough assessment of the quality, effectiveness, value and
independence of the audit provided by Deloitte LLP on an annual
basis, seeking the views and feedback of the Audit Committee
and fellow Board members, together with those of Group and
divisional management. There are no contractual restrictions
on the Committee as to the choice of external auditors.
The Committee considered the scope and materiality for the
audit work, approved the audit fee and reviewed the results
of the audit work.
The Committee has met the external auditors without
management being present several times during the year.
The Committee reviewed the policy on the engagement
of Deloitte LLP for non-audit services and conﬁrmed the
applicability of that policy in satisfying itself that their
independence and objectivity was not impaired. 
The key features of this policy are as follows: 
• work closely related to the audit e.g. taxation or ﬁnancial
reporting matters can be awarded to Deloitte LLP by the
executive directors provided the work does not exceed
£150,000 in fees per item; and
• all other work either requires Audit Committee approval or
forms part of a list of prohibited services, where it is felt
independence or objectivity may be compromised.
The Committee has reviewed the non-audit services performed
by Deloitte LLP in the year and has concluded that the policy
has been applied and their independence and objectivity has
not been impaired as a result. Details of fees paid to Deloitte
LLP during the ﬁnancial year are set out in note 6 to the
consolidated ﬁnancial statements on page 76.
After due and careful consideration, taking account of the
processes above, the Committee has recommended to the
Board that Deloitte LLP be re-appointed at the Annual
General Meeting to be held on 11 November 2009.
Internal controls and risk management 
The Audit Committee reviewed the Company’s internal
controls and risk management systems by considering the
Group’s risk assessment process and the effectiveness of the
controls to mitigate those risks. It considered the results of
testing performed by both the internal and external audit
teams in evaluating the effectiveness of such controls. 
Internal Audit 
The Audit Committee oversees the Internal Audit function.
In the previous ﬁnancial year, the Committee assessed
the performance of Internal Audit through an external
review carried out by BDO Stoy Hayward LLP. Certain
recommendations have been implemented during the
year, with an increased focus on the role of Internal Audit
in relation to the risk assessment process.
The Committee also reviewed the Internal Audit activities,
including the annual audit plan and resource requirements.
The plan has delivered both geographic and ﬁnancial coverage
as well as risk-based assurance behind key programmes
and central processes, such as the treasury function and
pension arrangements. 
The Committee received details of all key audit ﬁndings and
management updates on progress made in implementing
agreed actions. 
The Committee has met the internal auditors without
management being present. 
Raising concerns in conﬁdence 
The Audit Committee reviewed the Group’s procedures
enabling employees to raise concerns in conﬁdence.
Employees are able to raise concerns or report compliance
issues through an independent third-party organisation. The
Committee receives reports of any serious concerns raised at
each meeting. 
Audit Committee effectiveness 
The Audit Committee prepared and reviewed with the
Board an annual performance evaluation, which concluded
that the Committee has acted in accordance with its terms
of reference, is operating effectively and met all legal and
regulatory requirements. As part of this review, the Chairman
of the Audit Committee met with each Committee member
individually to discuss the ﬁndings and to obtain feedback.
The Chairman of the Audit Committee will be available at the
Annual General Meeting to answer any questions about the
work of the Committee. 
On behalf of the Audit Committee.

Structure of share capital 
As at 30 June 2009, the Company’s authorised share capital
of £88,980,947 comprised 8,898,094,700 Ordinary shares

share capital of £14,640,965.66 comprised 1,464,096,566
Ordinary shares of 1 pence each. No shares were allotted
during the year. Under the Companies Act 2006, companies
will no longer need to have an authorised share capital and
a resolution will be put to the Company’s shareholders at the
forthcoming Annual General Meeting to take advantage of this
deregulating measure. 
During the year, from 1 July 2008 to 30 June 2009, the
Company purchased 1,717,597 Ordinary shares of 1 pence at a
weighted average price, including transaction costs, of 79.02
pence and the total aggregate consideration was £1,357,320.70.
The percentage of issued capital purchased was 0.1%. 
Chapter 6 of part 18 of the Companies Act allows companies
to hold shares acquired by way of market purchase in treasury,
rather than having to cancel them. The directors may use the
authority to purchase shares and hold them in treasury (and
subsequently sell or transfer them out of treasury as permitted 
in accordance with the Act) rather than cancel them, subject 
to institutional guidelines applicable at the time. The shares
purchased by the Company in the year were held in treasury.
At 30 June 2009, 82,024,582 Ordinary shares of 1 pence were
held in treasury. 27,335 shares held in treasury were transferred
during the year to 30 June 2009 to satisfy awards of shares under
the Company’s employee share schemes and a further 6,306,657
shares were transferred to the Hays plc Employee Share Trust
to satisfy future option exercises under the Hays UK Sharesave
Scheme. No dividends have been paid on shares whilst held
in treasury and no voting rights attach to the treasury shares.
Rights and obligations of Ordinary shares 
On a show of hands at a general meeting every holder of
Ordinary shares present in person or by proxy and entitled
to vote shall have one vote. On a poll, every member present
in person or by proxy, shall have one vote for every Ordinary
share held. In accordance with the provisions of the Articles
of Association, holders of Ordinary shares are entitled to a
dividend where declared or paid out of proﬁts available for
such purposes. On return of capital on a winding up, holders
of Ordinary shares are entitled to participate in such a return.
Amendments to the Company’s Articles of Association will be
proposed at the forthcoming Annual General Meeting to take
account of the provisions of The Companies (Shareholders’
Rights) Regulations 2009. These will include measures relating
to the votes of proxies and multiple corporate representatives
at general meetings of the Company. Further information can
be found in the Circular to Shareholders accompanying the
Notice of Annual General Meeting. 
Restrictions on transfers of securities 
The restrictions on the transfer of shares in the Company are
as follows: 
• The Board may, in its absolute discretion and without giving
any reason, refuse to register the transfer of a certiﬁcated
share which is not fully paid, provided that the refusal does
not prevent dealing in shares in the Company from taking
place on an open and proper basis.
• The Board may also refuse to register the transfer of a
certiﬁcated share unless the instrument of transfer is lodged,
duly stamped (if stampable), at the office or at another place
appointed by the Board accompanied by the certiﬁcate for
the share to which it relates and such other evidence as the
Board may reasonably require to show the right of the
transferor to make the transfer.
• The Board may refuse to register a transfer of shares in favour
of more than four persons jointly.
• Where a shareholder has declined to provide certain
information requested by the Company in accordance with
the Companies Act, the Board can in certain circumstances
apply to the court for an order directing that the shares in
question be subject to restrictions. If an order is so made,
any transfer of (or any agreement to transfer) the shares
will be void and no voting rights will be exercisable in
respect of them.
• Restrictions may be imposed on certain Group employees
who are required to seek approval from the Company before
dealing in shares in accordance with the requirements of the
Listing Rules of the United Kingdom Listing Authority.
• Awards of shares under the Company’s incentive arrangements,
the Performance Share Plan and Deferred Annual Bonus Plan
are subject to restrictions on transfer of shares prior to vesting.

stake in the business, there are also a number of share schemes. 
As a responsible employer of thousands of people, the
Group is committed to equal opportunities and its policy

disabled whilst working for the Group, every effort is made to
ﬁnd a suitable alternative role and to assist with any retraining.

haysplc.com 55 Dear Shareholder
I am pleased to introduce the report of the Board covering
the remuneration policy and practice for the Company. 
2009 performance and reward
This year has seen the most challenging recruitment markets
on record. As a result, most of the listed recruitment companies
have reported year-on-year reductions in proﬁt of over 70%
for trading in the 2009 calendar year so far, and some are at
or below breakeven. In our last quarter update, we reported
a year-on-year reduction in net fees of 40% on a like-for-like
basis, which gives an indication of the fall in demand in our
markets. Our ability to deliver signiﬁcant levels of proﬁts in
our main businesses in this environment underlines the speed
with which we have taken action to reduce our cost base and
the strength of the Group’s operating model. 
Whilst we have minimal visibility on the year ahead, it seems
reasonable to assume that trading conditions will continue
to be tough until there are clear signs of economic recovery
in our principal markets. In this environment, we will continue
to balance shorter-term actions to protect proﬁtability with
longer-term investment to build market share and strengthen
our business. We ﬁrmly believe that the experience of our
management teams, the early actions we have taken to reduce
the cost base, our ﬁnancial strength and strategy of continuing
to invest in the long term, position us well to deal with both
the short-term challenges and to capitalise on the longer-
term opportunities.
Bonuses for executive directors for 2009 ranged between
59% and 64% of the maximum bonus opportunity. 30% of
each bonus award is to be paid in cash and 70% of the bonus
is to be awarded in shares and deferred for a further three-year
period. Whilst the market has been very challenging in 2009,
the Remuneration Committee (Committee) believes that
the Group’s results compare favourably with those of our
competitors and it is appropriate that bonuses for targets
achieved should be paid in line with the transitional
arrangements agreed for 2009. 
2010 remuneration arrangements
Due to the market uncertainties in 2008 and the associated
difficulties in setting long-term targets based on absolute
ﬁnancial measures, the Committee implemented a one-year
structure for the 2009 ﬁnancial year that kept the total value
of the package constant, but placed greater emphasis on the
annual bonus whilst ensuring there remained a strong link
with longer-term performance through signiﬁcant deferral into
shares. When we put in place these transitional arrangements
for 2009, we informed shareholders that they were a temporary

56 Hays plc Annual Report & Financial Statements 2009 measure for one year only. The key issue for the Committee
for the 2010 ﬁnancial year was how to replace the one-year
arrangement in a time of continuing market uncertainty.
During 2009, the Committee undertook an extensive review
of the remuneration arrangements. Our review of the structure
re-conﬁrmed the following design criteria for incentive plans
for executive directors and other senior executives at Hays:
– simplicity and clarity to ensure strong line of sight
for management; 
– alignment between reward and proﬁtability and shareholder
interests; and
– motivation of management to drive operational improvement
in the short term, but also to make the strategic investment
necessary to make Hays the international leader in recruitment. 
To enable investors to see clearly the changes to executive
director remuneration, the Remuneration Report explains the
arrangements for the 2008, 2009 and 2010 ﬁnancial years on
page 59.
In making changes, the Committee has been mindful of
the current economic climate, which has a direct impact on
the recruitment sector, increasing technological change in
the industry and also shareholder concerns about executive
pay. The proposed changes are intended to provide much
greater clarity for both participants and shareholders by
simplifying arrangements. 
Given the continuing economic uncertainty, the Committee
has decided that, for 2010, it is appropriate to rebalance
the mix between the short-term and long-term elements
of the incentive package for executive directors and to:
– reduce the overall incentive package;
– maintain the cash bonus potential at the 2008 and
2009 levels;
– increase the proportion of bonus based on ﬁnancial measures
from the 2008 and 2009 levels;
– increase the total annual bonus potential from the 2008 level,
offset by a corresponding increase in the level of compulsory
deferral into shares. This change represents a decrease on
2009 maximum annual bonus levels;
– remove the share match for the element of annual bonus that
is deferred into shares; 
– adjust the long term element of the package by increasing
the award under the Performance Share Plan (PSP) compared
to 2008 levels; and,
– reduce the threshold payout under the PSP.
These proposals are designed to provide a clear link with
shareholder interests. The deferral into shares will provide
a retention mechanism, which will be necessary as the
sector recovers. 
In the light of the uncertain economic outlook, the Committee
has decided to apply a single performance measure for the
2010 PSP awards, but may revert to two performance measures
for future years. Therefore, for 2010 PSP awards, relative Total
Shareholder Return (TSR) will be the sole long-term incentive
performance condition measured against a tailored sector peer
group. In addition, vesting will be subject to satisfactory
ﬁnancial performance over the performance period as
determined by the Committee. More detail on the 2010
proposals can be found on page 61 of the Report.
Given the current economic uncertainty, the need to manage
costs effectively and remuneration trends, no base salary
increases have been awarded to executive directors and
senior executives for the 2010 ﬁnancial year. 
The Committee is keen to ensure there is an open dialogue with
shareholders about our remuneration policy and a broad based
consensus amongst our shareholders on remuneration policy
matters. Certain aspects of the 2010 arrangements are still
under consultation as at the date of the Report. Any material
changes as a result of further consultation will be explained to
shareholders in the Chairman’s letter accompanying the Notice
of the Company’s 2009 Annual General Meeting.
The Committee has considered the most recent guidance from
the ABI, NAPF and Risk Metrics and believes that its remuneration
policies are appropriate.
The Committee unanimously recommends that shareholders
vote to approve the Remuneration Report at the 2009 Annual
General Meeting.
Lesley Knox
Remuneration Committee Chairman
haysplc.com 57 REMUNERATION REPORT
This Remuneration Report has been prepared in accordance
with Schedule 8 to The Large and Medium-sized Companies
and Groups (Accounts and Reports) Regulations 2008 and will
be submitted to shareholders for their approval at the Annual
General Meeting of the Company to be held on 11 November
2009. In carrying out its functions, the Committee has followed
the provisions of Schedule A to the June 2008 Combined Code
on Corporate Governance published by the Financial Reporting
Council. Further information on the Code can be found on the
Financial Reporting Council’s website, frc.org.uk.
Composition and terms of reference of the 
Remuneration Committee
The Board has delegated to the Committee, under agreed terms
of reference, responsibility for the remuneration policy and for
determining speciﬁc packages for the executive directors, the
Chairman and other senior executives. The Company consults
with key shareholders in respect of remuneration policy and
the introduction of new incentive arrangements. The terms of
reference for the Committee are available on the Company’s
website, haysplc.com, and from the Company Secretary at the
Registered Office.
The Remuneration Committee was chaired by Mrs L M S
Knox throughout the year under review. All members of the
Committee are independent non-executive directors. Messrs
C W Eccleshare, R J Smelt , P H Stoneham and P S Harrison
were Committee members throughout the year. The Committee
receives assistance from the Chairman, the Group HR Director
and the Group Company Secretary, who attend meetings
by invitation, except when issues relating to their own
remuneration are being discussed. The Committee met eight
times during the ﬁnancial year ended 30 June 2009. Meeting
attendance is shown on page 46 of this Annual Report.
Advisers to the Remuneration Committee
The Committee continues to engage the services of
PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP (PwC) as independent
remuneration advisers. During the ﬁnancial year, PwC
advised the Committee on all aspects of remuneration policy
for executive directors and members of the Management
Board. PwC also advised the Company on administrative and
compliance issues relating to the operation of the Company’s
share schemes around the world.
Freshﬁelds Bruckhaus Deringer LLP, who act as the Company’s
principal legal advisers, provided legal advice to the Committee
in the ﬁnancial year. 
Remuneration policy
The Committee determines the remuneration policy for
executive directors and other senior executives for current
and future years and this is reviewed on an annual basis.
The remuneration policy is designed to support the strategic
objectives of the Company and to allow the business to attract,
retain and motivate the quality of senior management needed
to shape and execute strategy and deliver shareholder value. 
Reward arrangements are designed around the
following principles:
• link reward to individual director’s performance and
Company performance to align the interests of senior
executives with those of shareholders; 
• base reward on both individual achievement and Group
results to encourage a team approach;
• maintain a competitive package against businesses of a
comparable size in the FTSE and comparable peer group
businesses in the recruitment sector;
• mirror the incentive and performance philosophy in
the business;
• encourage a personal stake in the business and focus on
longer-term business objectives via a long-term incentive plan;
• encourage directors and senior executives to build and
maintain a shareholding in the Company over a reasonable
period of time;
• provide a balanced mix of remuneration – base salary,
beneﬁts, pensions, short-term cash incentives and 
longer-term equity incentives:
– set base salaries at or around market median;
– provide an annual bonus opportunity against stretching
business targets. On-target performance will be rewarded
at or around median level;
– superior performance and business returns will result
in a total reward in excess of median and towards
upper quartile;
– provide a total reward package with a high percentage
based on variable performance elements. Around 70%
of the total cash/incentive package will be variable and
based on performance elements; and
• where appropriate, the Committee will review and agree 
one-off incentive arrangements to attract and retain 
individual directors.
How the executive directors were paid in 2009
Details of the speciﬁc 2009 remuneration arrangements for
the executive directors are set out in the table opposite.
The table sets out the key elements of the Company’s
remuneration policy for the 2008, 2009 and 2010 ﬁnancial
years. The reason for including 2008 in this comparison is that,
in most respects, the policy for 2010 is an evolution of the
policy in force for 2008. In contrast, the policy in place for
2009 was, as previously explained to shareholders, a one-year
transitional arrangement.

The remuneration packages for executive directors in respect of
2009 policy contained a signiﬁcant variable element dependent
on the level of performance of the business and the individual,
as can be seen from the chart below:
Notes
1. Variable compensation includes bonus awards and the value of awards made under the
Performance Share Plan and deferred bonus arrangements and associated match as stated
on page 59.
2. Fixed compensation comprises salary, pension contribution and other beneﬁts as stated in
the table on page 59.
Summary of share-based incentive schemes
This section describes the design of the Company’s current
share-based incentive schemes and how they were used in
the 2009 ﬁnancial year. The Company’s long-term incentives
primarily comprise the Performance Share Plan and the
Deferred Annual Bonus Plan. The Long Term Co-Investment
Plan is no longer used to make awards.
The Company follows the guidelines laid down by the ABI.
These restrict the issue of new shares (and transfers of treasury
shares) under all the Company’s share schemes in any 10-year
period to 10% of the issued ordinary share capital (excluding
shares held in treasury) and under the Company’s discretionary
schemes to 5% in any 10-year period. As at 30 June 2009,
the headroom available under these limits was 22.8% and
61.9%, respectively.
Performance Share Plan
The PSP is designed to link reward to the key long-term
value drivers of the business and to align the interests of
the executive directors and the global senior management
population with the long-term interests of shareholders. PSP
awards are granted annually and vesting is dependent on the
achievement of performance conditions measured over a 
three-year period. Award levels for executive directors and
other senior executives are determined each year by the
Committee, but must not exceed 200% of a participant’s
base salary in any ﬁnancial year. Awards for the 2009 ﬁnancial
year were capped at 50% for executive directors and other
senior executives. 
Approximately 330 key executives, including Mr A R Cox, 
Mr P Venables and seven other Management Board executives,
participated in PSP awards made in October 2008. Other
employees may be eligible to participate in future years at
the discretion of the Committee.
Bonus deferral arrangements
Bonus deferral promotes a stronger link between short-term and
long-term performance through deferral of annual bonuses into
shares for a three-year period and, in recent years, has included
a matching award of up to one share for each share deferred,
subject to performance conditions set by the Committee. For
the 2010 ﬁnancial year, no matching awards will be made.
Only the executive directors and other members of the
Management Board currently participate in the Company’s
bonus deferral arrangements. Other employees may be invited
to participate in future years at the Committee’s discretion.

All-employee share schemes
The Company has continued to operate the Hays UK Sharesave
Scheme (which is HMRC approved and is open to all eligible
staff in the United Kingdom) and the Hays International
Sharesave Scheme (which is open to staff in certain other
countries where the Group has operations). In the 2009 ﬁnancial
year, options over 10,086,221 shares at a price of 69 pence
per share, representing a 10% discount to market value, were
granted to 1,299 participants under both schemes. The take-up
rate was 21.6% of eligible employees.
Both schemes will expire in 2009 and a proposal to renew
them will be put to shareholders at the Company’s forthcoming
Annual General Meeting.
The executive directors’ interests in outstanding options and
awards, including performance conditions, are detailed in the
audited section of this Report from page 63 onwards.
Performance targets on incentives 
The Committee considers that performance conditions for all
incentives are suitably demanding, having regard to the business
strategy, shareholder expectations, cyclicality of the recruitment
markets in which the Group operates and on the basis of
external advice. To the extent that any performance condition
is not met, the relevant part of the award will lapse. There is
no re-testing of performance. The bonus awards payable in
respect of the 2009 ﬁnancial year, as reported on page 63,
were agreed by the Committee having reviewed the Company’s
results and the executive directors’ performance against their
personal objectives.
Details of the targets used to determine 2009 bonuses for the
executive directors are shown in the table below. 
Targets for executive directors’ 2009 annual bonuses

2
Target 92.6% 60%
Threshold 72.6% 20%
Performance levels between threshold, target and maximum
were graduated on a straight-line basis.
Notes
1. The EPS target was based on the market consensus of 9.89 pence for Hays derived from
the top eight investment banks following the publication of Hays’ 2008 results, taking into
account the unique circumstances that existed in October 2008 and against a background
of severe economic uncertainty. The EPS result for the 2009 ﬁnancial year of 7.72 pence
was below the threshold target of 7.92 pence and, therefore, no payment has been made
in respect of this element.
2. Cash Conversion is the operating cash ﬂow of the Company, after deducting net capital
expenditure items (excluding capital expenditure incurred on the Group’s strategic IT
projects) for the ﬁnancial year, stated as a percentage of operating proﬁt before exceptional
items. The Cash Conversion result for the 2009 ﬁnancial year of 149.2% was above the
maximum target and that achieved in 2007 and 2008. Full payment has been made in
respect of this element. The cash conversion result excluded a cash inﬂow of £20 million
that was determined to be a one-off windfall, which will reverse in the 2010 ﬁnancial year.
3 The personal objectives for the Chief Executive included key milestones for the development
of business strategy, marketing and technological improvements. Those for the Group
Finance Director included a number of targets relating to debt, cost and risk management
and the implementation of key back office systems. Progress against these objectives was
good but this element did not pay out in full.
60 Hays plc Annual Report & Financial Statements 2009 The performance conditions for outstanding long-term incentive
arrangements can be found on page 65 of this Report. The
emoluments of the executive directors and their share interests
are set out on pages 63 to 66.
Proposed changes for the 2010 ﬁnancial year
The Committee Chairman’s introduction on pages 56 and 57
explains the rationale and overview of the Committee’s proposals
for the 2010 ﬁnancial year. This section provides more detail on
the bonus and share incentive arrangements for 2010.
As the Committee is, at the date of this Report, consulting with
shareholders as to the proposed changes for the 2010 ﬁnancial
year, any material changes as a result of consultation will be
explained to shareholders in the Chairman’s letter accompanying
the Notice of the Company’s 2009 Annual General Meeting.
Bonuses for 2010 ﬁnancial year
The maximum annual bonus will be 125% of base salary for
executive directors. The measures used within the scheme will
not change, but the proportion based on ﬁnancial performance
will increase from 70% to 80% of bonus opportunity. Half of
the ﬁnancial component will be based on EPS and half will
be measured against a Group cash conversion target. In
the continuing difficult economic conditions, the Committee
believes that cash conversion remains a key performance
measure. The EPS target will be set after the publication
of results, taking into account market consensus. 20% of the
bonus opportunity (reduced from 30% in 2008 and 2009)
will be based on individual personal objectives. Similar bonus
arrangements at a lower level will be put in place for the 
seven Management Board members.
Of any bonus awarded, 40% will be deferred into restricted
shares for a period of three years, subject only to continued
employment. The Committee has removed the matching
component. However, the Committee retains discretion to
reduce the number of shares vesting if the underlying ﬁnancial
performance of the Company has not been satisfactory over the
performance period. The table below shows the bonus structure
for the last three years and demonstrates that the maximum
amount of cash bonus has remained relatively constant whilst
the proportion based on ﬁnancial measures has increased.

PSP for 2010 ﬁnancial year
To ensure greater alignment with the long-term interests of
shareholders, the Committee has increased the PSP award to
175% of base salary for executive directors. Given the ongoing
market uncertainties, the Committee believes it is appropriate
to use Total Shareholder Return (TSR) relative to a sector peer
group of competitors as the sole long-term measure for the
2010 PSP awards. The Committee may revert to two
performance measures for future years. 
The intended constituents of the comparator group for the 2010
awards is shown below:
Adecco SA
Kelly Services Inc
Manpower Inc
Michael Page International Plc
MPS Group, Inc
Randstad Holdings NV
Robert Half International Inc
Robert Walters Plc
SThree plc
USG People NV
The intended constituents of the peer group have been
chosen as those most closely reﬂecting the mix of the
Company’s business.
No awards will vest for TSR performance below median. If Hays’
TSR performance is equal to the median TSR performance of
the comparator group, 25% of the award will vest (reduced from
30% in 2008). If Hays’ TSR performance is equal to, or greater
than, the upper quartile TSR performance of the comparator
group, 100% of the award will vest.
Vesting levels between median and upper quartile performance
will be calculated on a straight-line basis.
In addition, vesting will be subject to satisfactory ﬁnancial
performance over the performance period as determined by
the Committee.
Pension, beneﬁts & shareholdings
There has been no change to the policies relating to pensions,
beneﬁts or shareholdings.
haysplc.com 61 Shareholding policy
To ensure that executive directors’ and other senior executives’
interests are aligned with shareholders over a longer time
horizon, the Committee require the Chief Executive to build
and maintain a shareholding in the Company of at least two
times base salary and other executive directors to build and
maintain a shareholding of at least one times base salary over
a reasonable timeframe, which would normally be ﬁve years.
Other Management Board executives are actively encouraged
to build a signiﬁcant shareholding in the Company over a
similar timeframe.
Service contracts
The Company’s policy on service contracts is that executive
directors’ contracts should be terminable on not more than one
year’s notice. In the event of early termination of a director’s
service contract, the Company would be required to pay
compensation reﬂecting the salary and beneﬁts to which
the director would have become entitled under the contract
during the notice period. Alternatively, the Company may, at
its discretion, pay a predetermined termination sum in lieu of
notice. In the event of early termination, the Committee will
give careful consideration to what compensation should be
paid taking into account the circumstances and the
responsibility of the individual to mitigate loss.

contract Unexpired Notice 
start date term period
R A Lawson Jul 2001 Indefinite One year
A R Cox Sep 2007 Indefinite One year
P Venables May 2006 Indefinite One year
Non-executive directors
The payment policy for non-executive directors is to pay the
market rate to secure persons of a suitable calibre for a group
of this size. The remuneration of the non-executive directors
is determined by the Board. The responsibility of the role
and international nature of the Group are fully considered
when setting the fee levels, along with external benchmarking
market data on the chairmanship of, and participation in,
Board committees.
The non-executive directors’ fees are non-pensionable and 
non-executive directors are not eligible to participate in any
incentive plans. The non-executive directors do not have
service contracts with the Company, but are appointed to the
Board under letters of appointment for an initial three-year
period. They are subject to retirement and re-appointment
by shareholders after their initial period and appointments
can be terminated immediately by the Company. Letters
of appointment are available for review from the Company
Secretary and a pro forma letter of appointment can be
viewed on the Company’s website: haysplc.com.
Policy on external appointments
The Company permits its executive directors to hold one
external non-executive directorship and all fees paid are
retained by the director. 
TSR performance
The graph below shows the value of £100 invested in the
Company’s shares compared to the FTSE 350 index over 
a ﬁve-year period. The graph shows the Total Shareholder
Return generated by both the movement in share value and

The Remuneration Committee considers that the FTSE 350
is the appropriate index because the Company has been a
member of this index throughout the period.

The remuneration of the highest paid director, Mr A R Cox, was £1,765,000. In 2009, the total value of the package for the
executive directors was kept constant but, due to the market uncertainties in 2008 and the associated difficulties in setting 
long-term targets based on absolute ﬁnancial measures, transitional arrangements were put in place in 2009, for one year only,
that re-balanced the package between short-term and long-term incentives, placing greater emphasis on the annual bonus, which
was increased to 240% in respect of executive directors.
Notes:
1. One additional salaried day occurred within the period.
2. The comparative 2008 total emoluments for Mr A R Cox include a payment of £228,000 made to him on appointment for loss of bonus payment from his previous employer. Messrs Cox and
Venables are required to compulsorily defer 70% (£624,456 and £484,573 respectively) of their 2009 annual bonuses into shares for a three-year restricted period. 25% of the total bonus will
qualify for a matching share award of up to one share for each share deferred under the Deferred Annual Bonus Plan, whilst the remaining 45% of total bonus will not qualify for matching. 
3. The non-cash elements of the emoluments are disclosed as beneﬁts-in-kind in the table and comprise car beneﬁt (or equivalent), permanent health beneﬁts and medical insurance and, in respect
of Messrs Cox and Venables, also life assurance. The car beneﬁt element includes an additional one day in the annual calculation period.

Notes:
1. Mr P Venables’ Committed Shares and matching shares formed part of special arrangements implemented in connection with his recruitment as Group Finance Director. Under these
arrangements Mr Venables was granted a conditional right to receive 41,420 shares (the Restricted Share Award), as set out under ‘Other conditional share awards’ below. In return for
committing 71,005 shares on terms broadly equivalent to the Company’s Long Term Co-Investment Plan, Mr Venables became potentially entitled (without payment) to the matching shares
stated above subject to satisfaction of the performance condition described in note 2 below. The shares under the Restricted Share Award to Mr Venables counted towards the maximum
number of shares he had committed, even though he was not the beneﬁcial owner of such shares prior to their vesting.
2. The matching shares (to a maximum of ﬁve times the number of Committed Shares) were subject to a performance condition based on the Company’s Total Shareholder Return (TSR)
performance relative to a peer group of 15 recruitment companies (including Hays) based in the United Kingdom and elsewhere. The comparator companies included: Adecco SA; Corporate
Services Group Plc; Harvey Nash Group Plc; Kelly Services Inc; Manpower Inc; Michael Page International Plc; Monster Worldwide Inc; OPD Group Plc; Randstad Holdings NV; Robert Half
International Inc; Robert Walters Plc; Spring Group Plc; Vedior NV; and Whitehead Mann Group Plc. Participants were entitled to 33% of the matching shares based on the Company’s TSR
performance over a three-year period, where Hays ranked in 8th position within the peer group. In addition to the Committed Shares and the vested matching shares, Mr P Venables received
a further 9,836 in dividend equivalent shares. The shares to which Mr Venables became entitled were satisﬁed out of existing shares only. The market price per share at the time of grant was
168.75 pence and at the time of vesting was 73.3 pence.

Notes:
1. A Restricted Share Award equivalent to the market value of £600,000 was awarded to Mr A R Cox on joining the Company. Subject to the satisfaction of the conditions summarised below,
the award vests in three tranches over the ﬁrst three years of Mr Cox’s employment, starting from 1 July 2007. One sixth of the award vests each year subject to continuing employment and one
sixth vests each year if the Group PBT growth exceeds RPI + 3% measured from the 30 June 2007 base year. On 2 September 2008, the ﬁrst tranche of shares vested and were released to Mr A
R Cox. RPI over the period rose by 4.6%, the target increase being 7.6%. PBT for the year ended 30 June 2007 was £211.7m and, for the year ended 30 June 2008, was £249.1m, giving an uplift
of 17.7%, which signiﬁcantly outperformed the target increase. The market price per share at the time of grant was 160.25 pence and at the time of vesting was 93.5 pence.
2. Mr P Venables’ Restricted Share Award was granted on terms equivalent to the Company’s Deferred Equity Share Plan and was linked to his award under the Long term Co-Investment Plan
described in the above section. The market price per share at the time of grant was 168.75 pence and at the time of vesting was 73.3 pence.

Notes
1. Cumulative EPS is the consolidated fully-diluted earnings per share of the Company calculated in accordance with IAS 33 for each ﬁnancial year cumulative over the performance period.
Goodwill impairments arising from acquisitions prior to 30 June 2006 are excluded from the EPS calculation. Cumulative International Net Fees is the net fees of the Company excluding UK
and Ireland for each ﬁnancial year cumulative over the performance period. In respect of October 2008 Matching Awards only, net fees attributable to Australia and New Zealand are also
excluded. International net fees arising from any acquisition made from the start of the relevant performance period are excluded from the International Net Fees calculation. Cumulative
Economic Proﬁt is the consolidated proﬁt of the Company after 30% tax but before interest less the weighted average cost of capital multiplied by the average capital employed for each
ﬁnancial year cumulative over the performance period. Cumulative Cash Conversion is the operating cash ﬂow of the Company, after deducting net capital expenditure (excluding capital
expenditure incurred on the Group’s strategic IT projects), stated as a percentage of operating proﬁt before exceptional items, for each ﬁnancial year cumulative over the performance period.
The Remuneration Committee may make adjustments to the calculations of Cumulative EPS, Cumulative Economic Proﬁt and Cumulative Cash Conversion, including taking account of unusual
or non-recurring items that do not reﬂect underlying performance.
2. The EPS element is subject to an underpin whereby the EPS element will vest only if the Committee is satisﬁed that operating proﬁt performance outperforms that of a comparator group of
companies over the performance period.

Share options
The Company operates two executive share option plans, although grants have ceased to be made under both of these plans: the
Hays plc 1995 Executive Share Option Scheme (ESOS) (which is unapproved for HMRC purposes) and the Hays plc 1996 Company
Share Option Plan (CSOP) (which is an HMRC approved scheme).
Options cannot be exercised under the ESOS and CSOP unless performance criteria are met. The performance criteria require
growth in Earnings Per Share (EPS) to have exceeded the growth rate in the RPI by 2% per annum in a three-year period prior
to exercise.

Independent Auditors’ Report on the Consolidated 
Financial Statements
Independent Auditors’ Report to the Members of Hays plc
We have audited the Group ﬁnancial statements of Hays plc for
the year ended 30 June 2009, which comprise the Consolidated
Income Statement, the Consolidated Balance Sheet, the
Consolidated Cash Flow Statement, the Consolidated Statement
of Recognised Income and Expense and the related notes 1 to
32. The ﬁnancial reporting framework that has been applied in
their preparation is applicable law and International Financial
Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the European
Union. We have also audited the information in the directors’
Remuneration Report that is described as having been audited.
This report is made solely to the Company’s members, as a body,
in accordance with sections 495 and 496 of the Companies Act
2006. Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might
state to the Company’s members those matters we are required
to state to them in an auditors’ report and for no other purpose.
To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or
assume responsibility to anyone other than the Company and
the Company’s members as a body, for our audit work, for this
report, or for the opinions we have formed.
Respective responsibilities of directors and auditors
As explained more fully in the directors’ responsibilities
statement, the directors are responsible for the preparation
of the Group ﬁnancial statements and for being satisﬁed that
they give a true and fair view.
Our responsibility is to audit the Group ﬁnancial statements
in accordance with applicable law and International Standards
on Auditing (UK and Ireland). Those standards require us to
comply with the Auditing Practices Board’s (APB’s) Ethical
Standards for Auditors.
Scope of the audit of the ﬁnancial statements
An audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts
and disclosures in the ﬁnancial statements sufficient to give
reasonable assurance that the ﬁnancial statements are free
from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or
error. This includes an assessment of: whether the accounting
policies are appropriate to the Group’s circumstances and
have been consistently applied and adequately disclosed;
the reasonableness of signiﬁcant accounting estimates
made by the directors; and the overall presentation of the
ﬁnancial statements.
Opinion on ﬁnancial statements
In our opinion the Group ﬁnancial statements:
• give a true and fair view of the state of the Group’s affairs as
at 30 June 2009 and of its proﬁt for the year then ended;
• have been properly prepared in accordance with IFRSs
as adopted by the European Union; and
• have been prepared in accordance with the requirements
of the Companies Act 2006 and Article 4 of the
IAS Regulation.
Opinion on other matters prescribed by the Companies
Act 2006
In our opinion:
• the part of the directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited
has been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies
Act 2006; and
• the information given in the Directors’ Report for the ﬁnancial
year for which the ﬁnancial statements are prepared is
consistent with the ﬁnancial statements.
Matters on which we are required to report by exception
We have nothing to report in respect of the following:
Under the Companies Act 2006 we are required to report
to you if, in our opinion:
• certain disclosures of directors’ remuneration speciﬁed
by law are not made; or
• we have not received all the information and explanations
we require for our audit.
Under the Listing Rules we are required to review:
• the directors’ statement contained within the Directors’
Report in relation to going concern; and
• the part of the Corporate Governance Statement relating
to the Company’s compliance with the nine provisions of
the June 2008 Combined Code speciﬁed for our review.
Other matters
We have reported separately on the parent Company ﬁnancial
statements of Hays plc for the year ended 30 June 2009 and
on the information in the directors’ Remuneration Report that
is described as having been audited.

Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements
1 General information
Hays plc is a Company incorporated in England and Wales and
its registered office is 250 Euston Road, London NW1 2AF.
The consolidated ﬁnancial statements have been prepared in
accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards
(IFRSs) and International Financial Reporting Interpretation
Committee interpretations (IFRICs) as adopted by the European
Union and therefore comply with Article 4 of the European
Union International Accounting Standard (IAS) Regulation.
New standards and interpretations
There have been no alterations made to the accounting policies
as a result of considering all amendments to IFRS and IFRIC
interpretations that became effective during the ﬁnancial year,
as these were considered to be immaterial to the Group’s
operations or were not relevant. 
The Group has not yet adopted certain new standards,
amendments and interpretations to existing standards, which
have been published but are only effective for our accounting
periods beginning on or after 1 January 2009 or later periods.
These new standards are listed below:
IFRS 8 Operating Segments 
IFRIC 17* Distributions of Non Cash Assets
to Owners 
IFRIC 18* Transfers of Assets to Customers 
IAS 1 (revised) Presentation of Financial Statements 
IAS 23 (amendment) Borrowing Costs 
IFRS 3 (revised)* Business Combinations
IAS 27 (revised)* Consolidated and Separate Financial
Statements
IFRS 2 (amendment) Share-Based Payments 
IFRS 5 (amendment) Non-current Assets Held for Sale and
Discontinued Operations
IAS 28 (amendment) Investment in Associates 
IAS 32 (amendment) Financial Instruments: Presentation 
IAS 38 (amendment) Intangible Assets 
IAS 39 (amendment) Financial Instruments: Recognition and
Measurement 
* Effective for accounting periods beginning on or after 1 July 2009.
The directors are currently evaluating the impact of the
adoption of these standards, amendments and interpretations.
The Group’s principal accounting policies adopted in the
presentation of these ﬁnancial statements are set out below
and have been consistently applied to all the periods presented.
2 Signiﬁcant accounting policies
aBasis of preparation
The consolidated ﬁnancial statements have been prepared in
accordance with IFRSs adopted for use in the European Union
and therefore comply with Article 4 of the EU IAS Regulation.
The consolidated ﬁnancial statements have been prepared on
the historical cost basis.
Going concern
The Group’s business activities, together with the factors likely to
effect its future development, performance and position are set
out in the review of the business on pages 2 to 43. The ﬁnancial
position of the Group, its cash ﬂows and liquidity position are
described in the ﬁnancial review on pages 28 to 32. In addition,
notes 17 to 18 to the consolidated ﬁnancial statements include
details of the Group’s treasury activities, long-term funding
arrangements and exposure to ﬁnancial risk.
The Group has sufficient ﬁnancial resources which, together
with internally generated cash ﬂows, will continue to provide
sufficient sources of liquidity to fund its current operations,
including its contractual and commercial commitments and
any proposed dividends, and the Group is well placed to
manage its business risks. 
After making enquiries, the directors have formed the
judgment, at the time of approving the consolidated ﬁnancial
statements, that there is a reasonable expectation that the
Group has adequate resources to continue in operational
existence for the foreseeable future. For this reason, the
directors continue to adopt the going concern basis in
preparing the consolidated ﬁnancial statements.
b Basis of consolidation
Subsidiaries are fully consolidated from the date on which
power to control is transferred to the Group. They are de-
consolidated from the date on which control ceases.
The purchase method of accounting is used to account for
the acquisition of subsidiaries by the Group. On acquisition
the identiﬁable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities
are measured at their fair values at the date of acquisition.
The excess of the cost of acquisition over the fair value of the
Group’s share of the identiﬁable net assets acquired is recorded
as goodwill. The ﬁnancial statements consolidate the accounts
of Hays plc and all of its subsidiary undertakings (‘subsidiaries’).
The results of subsidiaries acquired or disposed of during the
year are included from the effective date of acquisition or up
to the effective date of disposal, as appropriate.
All intra-Group transactions, balances, income and expenses are
eliminated on consolidation.
c Turnover
Turnover is measured at the fair value of the consideration
received or receivable and represents amounts receivable for
goods and services provided in the normal course of business,
net of discounts, VAT and other sales-related taxes.
Turnover arising from the placement of permanent candidates
is recognised at the time the candidate commences full-time
employment. Provision is made for the expected cost of
meeting obligations where employees do not work for the
speciﬁed contractual period.
Turnover arising from temporary placements is recognised over
the period that temporary staff are provided. Where the Group
is acting as a principal, turnover represents the amounts billed
for the services of the temporary staff, including the salary
costs of those staff.  Where Hays acts as principal in arrangements that invoice
on behalf of other recruitment agencies, turnover represents
amounts invoiced and collected on behalf of other recruitment
agencies, including arrangements where no commission is
directly receivable by the Group.
Where the Group is acting as an agent, turnover represents
commission receivable relating to the supply of temporary
staff and does not include the salary costs of the temporary
staff. Where the Group receives income in respect of payroll
processing, only the service fee element of this service is
recognised as turnover.
d Net fees
Net fees represent turnover less the remuneration costs
of temporary workers for temporary assignments. For the
placement of permanent candidates, net fees are equal
to turnover.
e Exceptional items
Exceptional items, as disclosed on the face of the Consolidated
Income Statement, are items which due to their size and non-
recurring nature have been classiﬁed separately in order to draw
them to the attention of the reader of the ﬁnancial statements
and to show the underlying proﬁts of the Group.
f Foreign currencies
On consolidation, the tangible and intangible assets and liabilities
of foreign subsidiaries denominated in foreign currencies are
translated into sterling at the rates ruling at the balance sheet
date. Income and expense items are translated into sterling
at average rates of exchange for the period. Any exchange
differences which have arisen from an entity’s investment in
a foreign subsidiary, including long-term loans, are recognised
as a separate component of equity and are to be included in
the Group’s translation reserve.
On disposal of a subsidiary, any amounts transferred to the
translation reserve are included in the calculation of proﬁt and
loss on disposal. All other translation differences are dealt with
in the Consolidated Income Statement.
Goodwill and fair-value adjustments arising on the acquisition
of a foreign entity are treated as assets and liabilities of the
foreign entity and translated at the closing rate.
g Retirement beneﬁt costs
The expense of deﬁned beneﬁt pension schemes and other 
post-retirement employee beneﬁts is determined using the
projected-unit credit method and charged to the Consolidated
Income Statement as an expense, based on actuarial assumptions
reﬂecting market conditions at the beginning of the ﬁnancial year.
Actuarial gains and losses are recognised in full in the Consolidated
Statement of Recognised Income and Expense in the period in
which they occur. Past service costs are recognised immediately
to the extent that beneﬁts have vested or, if not vested, on a
straight-line basis over the period until the beneﬁts vest.
The Group has chosen under IFRS 1 to recognise in retained
earnings all cumulative actuarial gains and losses as at
1 July 2004, the date of transition to IFRS. The Group has
chosen to recognise all actuarial gains and losses arising
subsequent to 1 July 2004 in the Consolidated Statement
of Recognised Income and Expense.
The retirement beneﬁt obligation recognised in the Consolidated
Balance Sheet represents the present value of the deﬁned
beneﬁt obligation as adjusted for unrecognised past service
cost, and as reduced by the fair value of scheme assets. Any
asset resulting from this calculation is limited to past service
cost, plus the present value of available refunds and reductions
in future contribution to the scheme.
Payments to deﬁned contribution schemes are charged as an
expense as they fall due.
h Share-based payments
The fair value of all share-based remuneration that is assessed
upon market based performance criteria is determined at the
date of grant and recognised as an expense in the Consolidated
Income Statement on a straight-line basis over the vesting
period, taking account of the estimated number of shares that
will vest.
The fair value of all share-based remuneration that is assessed
upon non-market based performance criteria is determined
at the date of the grant and recognised as an expense in the
Consolidated Income Statement over the vesting period, based
on the number of shares that are expected to vest. The number
of shares that are expected to vest is adjusted accordingly to
the satisfaction of the performance criteria at each period end.
The fair values are determined by use of the relevant valuation
models. All share-based remuneration is equity settled.
i Borrowing costs
Borrowing costs are recognised in proﬁt or loss in the period
in which they are incurred.
j Taxation
The tax expense comprises both current and deferred tax.
The tax currently payable is based on taxable proﬁt for the
year. Taxable proﬁt differs from net proﬁt as reported in the
Consolidated Income Statement because it excludes items of
income or expense that are taxable or deductible in other years
and it further excludes items that are never taxable or deductible.
The Group’s liability for current tax is calculated using tax rates
that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance
sheet date.
Deferred tax is provided in full on all temporary differences, at
rates that are enacted or substantively enacted by the balance
sheet date. Deferred tax assets are recognised only to the
extent that it is probable that taxable proﬁts will be available
against which to offset the deductible temporary differences.
Temporary differences arise where there is a difference
between the accounting carrying value in the Consolidated
Balance Sheet and the amount attributed to that asset or
liability for tax purposes.
Deferred tax is provided on unremitted earnings of subsidiaries
and associates, where the Group is unable to control the timing
of the distribution, and it is probable that the temporary
difference will reverse in the future.
k Goodwill
Goodwill arising on consolidation represents the excess of
purchase consideration less the fair value of the identiﬁable
tangible and intangible assets and liabilities acquired.
72 Hays plc Annual Report & Financial Statements 2009
Financial Statements
Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements continued
2 Signiﬁcant accounting policies continued Goodwill is recognised as an asset and reviewed for impairment
at least annually. Any impairment is recognised immediately in
the proﬁt or loss and is not subsequently reversed.
On disposal of a business the attributable amount of goodwill
is included in the determination of the proﬁt or loss on disposal.
Goodwill arising on acquisitions before the date of transition to
IFRS (1 July 2004) has been retained at the previous UK GAAP
amounts, subject to being tested for impairment at that date.
Goodwill arising on acquisitions prior to 1 July 1998 was written
off direct to reserves under UK GAAP. This goodwill has not
been reinstated and is not included in determining any
subsequent proﬁt or loss on disposal.
l Intangible assets
Intangible assets acquired as part of a business combination are
stated in the Consolidated Balance Sheet at their fair value as at
the date of acquisition less accumulated amortisation and any
provision for impairment. The directors review intangible assets
for indications of impairment annually.
Internally generated intangible assets are stated in the
Consolidated Balance Sheet at the directly attributable cost of
creation of the asset, less accumulated amortisation. Intangible
assets are amortised systematically over their estimated useful
lives up to a maximum of 10 years. Software is amortised
between three and ﬁve years.
m Property, plant and equipment
Property, plant and equipment is recorded at cost, net of
depreciation and any provision for impairment. Depreciation
is provided on a straight-line basis over the anticipated useful
working lives of the assets, after they have been brought into
use, at the following rates:
Freehold land – No depreciation is provided
Freehold buildings – At rates varying between 2% and 10%
Leasehold properties – The cost is written off over the
unexpired term of the lease
Plant and machinery – At rates varying between 5% and 33%
Fixtures and ﬁttings – At rates varying between 10% and 25%
n Trade receivables
Trade receivables are measured at fair value after appropriate
allowances for estimated irrecoverable amounts have been
recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement where there
is objective evidence that the asset is impaired.
o Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash-in-hand and current
balances with banks and similar institutions, which are readily
convertible to known amounts of cash and which are subject
to insigniﬁcant risk of changes in value.
p Trade payables
Trade payables are measured at fair value.
q Bank borrowings
Interest-bearing bank loans and overdrafts are recorded at the
amount of the proceeds received, net of direct-issue costs.
  Finance charges, including premiums payable on settlement
or redemption and direct-issue costs, are accounted for on an
accrual basis in proﬁt or loss using the effective interest
rate method and are added to the carrying amount of the
instrument to the extent that they are not settled in the
period in which they arise.
r Leases
Leases where a signiﬁcant portion of risks and rewards of
ownership are retained by the lessor are classiﬁed as operating
leases by the lessee.
Rentals payable under operating leases are charged to the
Consolidated Income Statement on a straight-line basis over
the lease term.
Beneﬁts received and receivable as an incentive to enter into an
operating lease are also spread on a straight-line basis over the
lease term.
s Provisions
A provision is recognised when the Group has a present legal or
constructive obligation as a result of a past event for which it is
probable that an outﬂow of resources will be required to settle
the obligation and the amount can be reliably estimated. If the
effect is material, provisions are determined by discounting the
expected future cash ﬂows at a pre-tax rate that reﬂects the
current market assessments of the time value of money and
the risks speciﬁc to the liability.
3 Critical accounting judgements and key sources of
estimation uncertainty
(i) Retirement beneﬁt obligations
Under IAS 19 ‘Employee Beneﬁts’, the Group has recognised
a pension deﬁcit of £109.2 million (2008 – £88.1 million).
The change in the deﬁcit is mainly attributable to lower than
expected asset returns over the period combined with the
experience losses on the liabilities offset by the change in
assumptions between the start and end of the year due to the
bond yield increase. The main assumptions are set out in note
20 of the ﬁnancial statements.
(ii) Goodwill impairment
Goodwill is tested for impairment on an annual basis. In
performing these tests, assumptions are made in respect
of future growth rates and the discount rate to be applied
to the future cash ﬂows of income generating units. These
assumptions are set out in note 13 of the ﬁnancial statements.
(iii)Provisions in respect of disposed businesses
As described in note 21, provisions in respect of disposed
businesses have been made. In assessing the adequacy of these
provisions, estimates are made of probable cash outﬂows in
the future.
(iv)Provisions in respect of recoverability of trade receivables
As described in note 16, provisions for impairment of trade
receivables have been made. In reviewing the appropriateness
of these provisions, consideration has been given to the ageing
of the debt and the potential likelihood of default, taking into
account current economic conditions.

5 Exceptional items
There have been no items in the current year that have been classiﬁed as exceptional.
During the prior year, the Group amended the terms of its deﬁned beneﬁt pension scheme. This amendment restricts the annual
increase in pensionable pay/qualifying earnings to the lower of inﬂation or 5%. The effect of this change was a curtailment beneﬁt
that was recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement as an exceptional credit of £22.0 million. Also during the prior year, the
Group initiated a Group-wide project to transform its IT infrastructure, software and business operations. This led the directors to
conclude that the carrying value of certain intangible and tangible assets that were previously used in its operations were impaired
and they were written down by £6.7 million. The exceptional credit generated a tax charge of £4.3 million.
There was no cash impact from the exceptional items arising in the prior year.

Additions during the year – 0.3
Amounts written back in year (4.2) –
At 30 June 174.9 168.9
In the current year, the amount written back of £4.2 million represents the reversal of deferred contingent consideration for an
acquisition that was determined to be no longer required.
Goodwill arising on business combinations is reviewed and tested on an annual basis or more frequently if there is indication that
goodwill might be impaired. Goodwill has been tested for impairment by comparing the carrying amount of each cash-generating
unit (‘CGU’), including goodwill, with the recoverable amount. The recoverable amounts of the CGUs are determined from 
value-in-use calculations.
The key assumptions for the value-in-use calculations are those regarding operating proﬁt, discount rates and growth rates. The
operating proﬁt is based on the latest forecasts for the CGUs approved by management and management estimates discount rates
using post-tax rates that reﬂect current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks speciﬁc to the CGUs. The
Group prepares cash ﬂow forecasts derived from the most recent ﬁnancial forecasts approved by management and extrapolates
cash ﬂows for the following years based on the long-term growth rates. The long-term growth rates are based on management
forecasts of an average estimated growth rate of 3.0% (2008 – 3.0%), reﬂecting long-term wage inﬂation fee growth. The rate used
to discount the forecast cash ﬂows is 9.0% post tax (2008 – 9.5%). The reduction on the prior year discount rate is driven by a fall
in risk-free return.
Impairment reviews were performed at the year end by comparing the carrying value of goodwill with the recoverable amount
of the CGUs to which goodwill has been allocated. Management determined that there has been no impairment.
Given the current economic climate, a sensitivity analysis has been performed in assessing recoverable amounts of goodwill.
This has been based on changes in key assumptions considered to be possible by management. This included an increase in
the discount factor of up to 0.5% and a decrease in the long-term growth rate of up to 1%. The sensitivity analysis shows that
no impairment would arise under each scenario other than in the case of a part of Asia Paciﬁc. This has no headroom based
on current assumptions, where a reduction in the discount factor and long-term growth rate would result in an impairment
of up to £1.5 million. Management will continue to monitor this acquisition but do not consider impairment appropriate.
Goodwill acquired in a business combination is allocated, at acquisition, to the CGUs that are expected to beneﬁt from that
business combination. The carrying amount of goodwill had been allocated as follows:

Credit risk 
The Group’s credit risk is primarily attributable to its trade receivables. The amounts presented in the Balance Sheet are net of
allowances for doubtful receivables. An allowance for impairment is made where there is an identiﬁed loss event which, based
on previous experience, is evidence of a likely reduction in the recoverability of the cash ﬂows. The Group has no signiﬁcant
concentration of risk, with exposure spread over a large number of customers. 
The risk disclosures contained on page 33 within the Directors’ Report form part of these ﬁnancial statements.

(In £’s million) 2009 2008
Floating rate – Sterling 54.3 135.1
The ﬂoating rate liabilities comprise unsecured overdrafts and loan notes bearing interest at rates based on local money-market rates.
(b) Maturities of bank loans and overdrafts
(In £’s million) 2009 2008
The maturity of borrowings are as follows: 
More than one year 54.3 135.1
(c) Fair values of ﬁnancial assets and bank loans and overdrafts
The fair value of ﬁnancial assets and bank loans and overdrafts is not materially different to their book value due to the short-term
maturity of the instruments, which are based on ﬂoating rates.
(d) Committed facilities
The Group has a £460 million unsecured revolving credit facility available which expires in February 2011. The covenants in the
facility require the Group’s interest cover to be at least 4:1 and its leverage ratio (net debt to EBITDA) to be no greater than 3:1.
The interest rate on the facility is based on a ratchet mechanism with a margin payable over LIBOR in the range 0.375% to 0.525%.
At 30 June 2009, £408.0 million of the committed facility was undrawn. 
(e) Currency exposure
The Group did not have a material Income Statement exposure to foreign exchange gains or losses on monetary assets and
liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at 30 June 2009.
(f) Interest rates
The weighted average interest rates paid were as follows:

20 Retirement beneﬁt obligations
Within the UK, the Group operates one deﬁned contribution scheme and two deﬁned beneﬁt schemes. The majority of overseas
arrangements are either deﬁned contribution or government-sponsored schemes and these arrangements are not material in the
context of the Group results.
UK Deﬁned Contribution Scheme
The Hays Stakeholder Pension Plan was established on 1 July 2001. Money purchase beneﬁts are funded by contributions from
employees and, for eligible employees, from the employer. Employer contributions are in the range of 2% to 18% of pensionable
salary depending on the length of pensionable service and seniority.
The total cost charged to the Consolidated Income Statement of £1.4 million (2008 – £1.1 million) represents employers contributions
payable to the Stakeholder Pension Plan. Contributions of £0.1 million (2008 – £nil) were outstanding at the end of the year.
The assets of the Stakeholder Pension Plan are held separately from those of the Group.
UK Deﬁned Beneﬁt Schemes
(i) The Hays Pension Scheme, is a deﬁned beneﬁt scheme where the beneﬁts are based on employees’ length of service and ﬁnal
pensionable pay. It is a funded approved deﬁned beneﬁt scheme and closed to new members on 1 July 2001. It is funded
through a legally separate trustee administered fund.
(ii) The Hays Supplementary Pension Scheme is a supplementary unfunded unapproved retirement beneﬁt scheme for employees
who were subject to HMRC’s earnings cap on pensionable salary.
The last formal actuarial valuations were performed at 30 June 2006. A roll forward of the actuarial valuations of the Hays Pension
Scheme and the Hays Supplementary Pension Scheme to 30 June 2009 has been performed by the Scheme actuary, an employee
of Mercer Human Resource Consulting. The key assumptions used at 30 June 2009 are listed on the following page.
IAS 19 accounting valuation
Hays plc has applied the accounting requirements of IAS 19 as follows:
• scheme assets are measured at fair value at the balance sheet date;
• scheme liabilities are measured using a projected-unit credit method and discounted at the current rate of return on high quality
corporate bonds of equivalent term to the liability; and
• actuarial gains and losses are recognised in full in the period in which they occur, outside of the Consolidated Income Statement,
in retained earnings and presented in the Consolidated Statement of Recognised Income and Expense.

The key assumptions are as follows:
2009 2008
Inflation assumption 3.65% 3.70%
Discount rate 6.35% 5.75%
Rate of increase in salaries 3.90% 3.95%
Rate of increase of pensions in payment and deferment 3.65% 3.70%
Expected long-term rates of return on scheme assets 6.46% 6.43%
The assumption for the expected long-term returns for scheme assets is a weighted average based on the assumed expected return
for each asset class and the proportions held of each asset class at the beginning of the year.
The long-term expected rate of return on scheme assets does not affect the level of the obligation but does affect the expected
return on pension scheme assets within the net ﬁnance (charge)/income.
The mortality rates have been calculated using the PA92 generational mortality tables with a medium cohort projection. This assumes
that a 65-year old, male, current pensioner has a life expectancy of 21.9 years. 
The amounts recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement for the deﬁned beneﬁt schemes are as follows:

329.9 6.46% 386.7 6.43%
To develop the expected long-term rate of return on assets assumption used in determining the net pension cost for the year to June
2009, the Group considered the level of expected returns on risk-free investments (primarily government bonds), the rate of return
on AA rated corporate bonds, the level of risk premium associated with the other asset classes in which the portfolio is invested and
the expectations for future returns of each asset class. The expected return for each asset class was then weighted based on the
asset allocation to develop the expected long-term rate of return on asset assumption for the portfolio.

At the balance sheet date, the Group has unused tax losses of £36.1 million (2008 – £32.9 million) available for offset against future
proﬁts, of which £9.9 million relates to United Kingdom capital losses, £8.4 million relates to United Kingdom losses and £17.8
million relates to overseas losses. No material deferred tax asset has been recognised in respect of such losses (2008 – nil). These
are unrecognised tax losses of which £0.1 million is due to expire in 2012 and £36.0 million is unlikely to expire in the short term. 
The Group has unused tax credits of £3.1 million (2008 – £3.1 million) available for off set against future proﬁts. These credits are
unlikely to expire in the short term. No deferred tax asset has been recognised in respect of these credits (2008 – nil).
The aggregate amount of temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries on which deferred tax liabilities
have not been provided is £92.6 million. The reason for not providing for these liabilities, is because the Group is in a position
to control the timing of the reversal of the temporary differences. Additionally it is probable that such differences will not reverse
in the foreseeable future and the level of underlying tax credit on remitted earnings is likely to cover any UK corporation tax.

Long Term Co-Incentive Plan (LTCIP)
In previous years, employees were invited to commit a number of shares to the LTCIP. The LTCIP was based upon the Total
Shareholder Return (TSR) of the Company over a three-year period, compared to a peer group of 15 companies (including
Hays plc). Dependent upon the performance ranking, the Company was to match up to ﬁve times the number of shares committed
by the employee. If the ranking of Hays plc was ninth or less then there was to be no matching of shares by the Company.
The 2005 LTCIP award vested on 14 December 2008 and participants became entitled to 33% of the matching shares based on
the Company’s TSR performance over the three-year period to 14 December 2008, where Hays was ranked in 8th position out
of the peer group of 15 companies. A total of 0.4 million shares were matched for this award. 
All awards under this scheme have now vested and there is currently no intention of making further awards.
Performance Share Plan (PSP) and Deferred Annual Bonus (DAB)
These are the incentive arrangements that replaced the LTCIP in 2007. Only members of the Management Board participate in the
DAB and circa 330 managers participate in the PSP.
The PSP and DAB are equity settled share-based payment awards with non-market performance conditions over a three-year
period. For existing DAB awards, up to a maximum of 100% of the annual bonus is deferred into Hays shares and is matched with
free conditional shares at a maximum one for one basis, subject to the performance conditions over a three-year period. Under
the PSP, generally the awards are a maximum of 30% to 150% of a participant’s base salary and will not exceed two times a
participant’s base salary in any ﬁnancial year.
The ﬁrst PSP award, PSP 1, made in April 2007 and the ﬁrst DAB award, DAB 1, made in May 2007 have a performance period
of three years from 1 July 2006 to 30 June 2009. The second awards, PSP 2 and DAB 2, were made in September 2007 for a
three-year performance period from 1 July 2007 to 30 June 2010. The third awards, PSP 3 and DAB 3, were made in October 2008
for a three-year performance period from 1 July 2008 to 30 June 2011.
The performance criteria for the DAB awards are combinations of cumulative EPS, cumulative International Net Fees and cumulative
Cash Conversion set each year. The performance criteria for the PSP awards are combinations of Group EPS, Economic Proﬁt,
Regional Operating Proﬁt, Divisional Operating Proﬁt and Country or Sub-Regional Proﬁt, depending on the recipient’s role. 
The PSP awards are either on a one or three-year performance period, with no re-testing of performance conditions. For one-year
performance period awards there is a two-year holding period before vesting.

Financial Statements
Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements continued Independent Auditors’ Report to the Members of Hays plc
We have audited the parent Company ﬁnancial statements
of Hays plc for the year ended 30 June 2009 which comprise
the parent Company Balance Sheet and the related notes 1 to
17. The ﬁnancial reporting framework that has been applied
in their preparation is applicable law and United Kingdom
Accounting Standards (United Kingdom Generally Accepted
Accounting Practice).
This report is made solely to the Company’s members, as a
body, in accordance with sections 495, 496 and 497 of the
Companies Act 2006. Our audit work has been undertaken so
that we might state to the Company’s members those matters
we are required to state to them in an auditors’ report and for
no other purpose. To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do
not accept or assume responsibility to anyone other than the
Company and the Company’s members as a body, for our audit
work, for this report, or for the opinions we have formed.
Respective responsibilities of directors and auditors
As explained more fully in the directors’ responsibilities
statement, the directors are responsible for the preparation of
the parent Company ﬁnancial statements and for being satisﬁed
that they give a true and fair view. Our responsibility is to audit
the parent Company ﬁnancial statements in accordance with
applicable law and International Standards on Auditing (UK and
Ireland). Those standards require us to comply with the Auditing
Practices Board’s (APB’s) Ethical Standards for Auditors.
Scope of the audit of the ﬁnancial statements
An audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts
and disclosures in the ﬁnancial statements sufficient to give
reasonable assurance that the ﬁnancial statements are free from
material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or error. This
includes an assessment of: whether the accounting policies
are appropriate to the parent Company’s circumstances and
have been consistently applied and adequately disclosed; the
reasonableness of signiﬁcant accounting estimates made by the
directors; and the overall presentation of the ﬁnancial statements.
Opinion on ﬁnancial statements
In our opinion the parent Company ﬁnancial statements:
• give a true and fair view of the state of the parent Company’s
affairs as at 30 June 2009 and of its proﬁt for the year then
ended;
• have been properly prepared in accordance with United
Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice; and
• have been prepared in accordance with the requirements
of the Companies Act 2006.
Opinion on other matters prescribed by the Companies
Act 2006
In our opinion:
• the part of the directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited
has been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies
Act 2006; and
• the information given in the Directors’ Report for the ﬁnancial
year for which the ﬁnancial statements are prepared is
consistent with the parent Company ﬁnancial statements.
Matters on which we are required to report by exception
We have nothing to report in respect of the following matters
where the Companies Act 2006 requires us to report to you if,
in our opinion:
• adequate accounting records have not been kept by the
parent Company, or returns adequate for our audit have
not been received from branches not visited by us; or
• the parent Company ﬁnancial statements and the part of
the directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited are not
in agreement with the accounting records and returns; or
• certain disclosures of directors’ remuneration speciﬁed by
law are not made; or
• we have not received all the information and explanations
we require for our audit.
Other matter
We have reported separately on the Group ﬁnancial statements
of Hays plc for the year ended 30 June 2009.

Financial Statements
Hays plc Company Balance Sheet
for the year ended 30 June 1 Basis of preparation
(i) Accounting basis
The separate ﬁnancial statements of the Company are presented
as required by the Companies Act 2006. They have been
prepared under the historical cost convention and in accordance
with applicable United Kingdom Accounting Standards and Law.
As permitted by section 408 of the Companies Act 2006, the
Company’s proﬁt and loss account has not been presented.
The Company’s principal accounting policies adopted in the
presentation of these ﬁnancial statements are set out below
and have been consistently applied to all periods presented.
Cash ﬂow statement and related party disclosures
The results, assets and liabilities of the Company are included
in the consolidated ﬁnancial statements of Hays plc, which
are publicly available. Consequently, the Company has taken
exemption from preparing a cash ﬂow statement under the terms
of FRS 1 (revised) ‘Cash Flow Statements’. The Company is also
exempt under the terms of FRS 8 ‘Related Party Disclosures’
from disclosing related party transactions with entities that are
part of the Group.
(ii) Investments
Shares in subsidiaries are valued at cost less provision
for impairment. 
(iii)Property, plant and equipment
Property, plant and equipment is recorded at cost, net of
depreciation and any provision for impairment. Depreciation
is provided on a straight-line basis over the anticipated useful
working lives of the assets, after they have been brought into
use, at the following rates:
Plant and machinery – At rates varying between 5% and 33%
Fixtures and ﬁttings – At rates varying between 10% and 25%
(iv)Deferred taxation
Deferred tax is provided in full on all timing differences which
result in an obligation at the balance sheet date to pay more
tax, or a right to pay less tax, at a future date, at rates expected
to apply when they crystallise. Timing differences arise from
the inclusion of items of income and expenditure in taxation
computations in periods different from those in which they are
included in ﬁnancial statements. Deferred tax is not provided on
unremitted earnings of subsidiaries and associates where there
is no commitment to remit these earnings. Deferred tax assets
are recognised to the extent that it is regarded as more likely
than not that they will be recovered. Deferred tax assets and
liabilities are not discounted.
(v) Pension costs
For deﬁned beneﬁt schemes the amounts charged to operating
proﬁt are the current service costs and gains and losses on
settlements and curtailments. They are included as part of staff
costs. Past service costs are recognised immediately in the proﬁt
and loss account if the beneﬁts have vested. If the beneﬁts have
not vested immediately, the costs are recognised over the period
until vesting occurs. The interest cost and the expected return
on assets are shown as a net amount of other ﬁnance costs
or credits adjacent to interest. Actuarial gains and losses are
recognised immediately in the Statement of Total Recognised
Gains and Losses. 
The main deﬁned beneﬁt scheme is funded, with the assets
of the scheme held separately from those of the Group, in
separate trustee administered funds. Pension scheme assets
are measured at fair value and liabilities are measured on an
actuarial basis using the projected unit method and discounted
at a rate equivalent to the current rate of return on a high
quality corporate bond of equivalent currency and term to
the scheme liabilities. The actuarial valuations are obtained
at least triennially and are updated at each balance sheet date.
The resulting deﬁned beneﬁt asset or liability, net of the related
deferred tax, is presented separately after other net assets on
the face of the Company Balance Sheet.
(vi)Employee share option schemes
The Company operates a number of employee share option
schemes. All equity-settled, share based payments are
measured at fair value at the date of grant. All equity-settled,
share-based payment schemes are dealt within the Balance
Sheet by including them within total equity shareholders’
interests in accordance with FRS 20, ‘Share-based payments’. 
(vii) Dividends
Dividends are recognised in the period that they are declared
and approved.
2 Employee information
Details of directors’ emoluments and interests are included
in the Remuneration Report on pages 56 to 66 in the Group
Annual Report. Except for the directors there were no employees
of the Company in 2009 or 2008.
3 Proﬁt for the year
Hays plc has not presented its own proﬁt and loss account and
related notes as permitted by section 408 of the Companies
Act 2006. The proﬁt for the ﬁnancial year dealt with in the
ﬁnancial statements of the parent Company is £48.1 million
(2008 – £182.3 million). The auditors’ remuneration for audit
services to the Company was £0.3 million (2008 – £0.3 million).

11 Retirement beneﬁt obligations
The Company is the sponsoring employer for all of the Hays deﬁned beneﬁt pension schemes and recognises the full liability on
its Balance Sheet. Under FRS 17 the actual cost of providing pensions to the Company is charged to the proﬁt and loss account
as incurred during the year, net of costs paid by subsidiary companies.
The pension cost charged to the Company’s proﬁt and loss account is a charge of £0.6 million (2008 – credit of £20.7 million). 
The mortality rates have been calculated using the PA92 generational mortality tables with a medium cohort projection. This assumes
that a 65-year old, male, current pensioner has a life expectancy of 21.9 years.
The movement in the deﬁcit during the year is analysed below:
(In £’s million) 2009 2008
Deficit in the scheme brought forward (88.1) (43.5)
Current service cost (4.5) (5.7)
Past service costs/curtailments – 22.0
Contributions 7.0 7.3
Net financial return (2.4) 3.0
Actuarial loss (21.2) (71.2)
Deficit in the scheme carried forward (109.2) (88.1)
Based on actuarial advice, the ﬁnancial assumptions used in calculating the scheme’s liabilities under FRS 17 are:
2009 2008 2007 2006 2005
Rate of increase in salaries 3.90% 3.95% 5.80% 5.40% 5.10%
Rate of increase of pensions in payment and deferment 3.65% 3.70% 3.30% 2.90% 2.60%
Discount rate 6.35% 5.75% 5.57% 5.22% 4.95%
Inflation assumption 3.65% 3.70% 3.30% 2.90% 2.60%

Future proﬁle of Hays Pension Scheme
The Hays Pension Scheme was closed to new members with effect from 1 July 2001. The age proﬁle of the active membership will
rise over time and hence the future service cost (as a percentage of annual salaries) is also likely to rise. The Group has considered
the impact of the FRS 17 deﬁcit in respect of the Group, its employees and pensioners. In the context of the prudent funding structure
of the Group, the Group is in a strong position to manage this long-term liability to the satisfaction and beneﬁt of all stakeholders. 
The estimated amounts of contributions expected to be paid to the scheme during the current ﬁnancial year will be in the range
of £10-20 million subject to the triennial actuarial valuation.

Property provisions are for rents and other related amounts payable on certain leased properties for periods in which they are not
anticipated to be in use by the Company. The leases expire in periods up to 2013.
It is not possible to estimate the timing of payments against the other deferred employee beneﬁt provisions.
Other provisions include liabilities arising as a result of the business disposals and the Group transformation that concluded in 2004
in relation to businesses disposed of. It is not possible to estimate the timing of payments against these provisions.

Capital Gains Tax base cost of Hays Shares
Following the demerger of DX Services on 1 November 2004,
the original base cost of your Hays plc shares for Capital Gains
Tax purposes should be allocated between your Hays plc shares
and the DX Services plc shares that you received as follows: 
Hays plc shares 89.57%
DX Services plc shares 10.43% 
For example, suppose you held 100 Hays plc shares for which
the base cost is £100. Immediately after the demerger, you held
100 Hays plc shares and ﬁve DX Services plc shares. The £100
cost should be allocated between these shares as follows: 
Hays plc shares 89.57% x £100 = £89.57, or £0.90 per share DX
Services plc shares 10.43% x £100 = £10.43, or £2.09 per share. 
If you are in any doubt about the allocation of the base cost
between the shares of the two companies, you should consult
your tax adviser.

Introduction
I am pleased to present our annual report for the year ended  
31 March 2013.
Financial Overview
The business continues to grow in line with our expectations. 
Revenue has increased by 11.8% to £6,503,265 from 
£5,819,328 achieved last year. All of this growth has been 
achieved organically. Profit before tax of £940,104 is an increase 
of 8.9% on the previous year’s £863,093.
This profits growth has not flowed through to a corresponding 
increase in earnings per share as the tax charge has risen to 
19.4% from 13.5% last year and just 2.4% the previous year. 
This reflects the steady utilisation of our tax losses. The tax 
charge is likely to increase only modestly in the coming year, so 
that growth in profits will flow through to earnings per share.
The net assets per share continue to increase and are now 
6.4p per share up from 5.2p last year. In January 2013 we 
completed the purchase of the building housing our Crisis 
Response Management Centre in Cape Town. Slightly over half 
the purchase price was funded by a local bank loan and the rest 
provided from our available cash. Despite this, and payment 
of UK corporation tax for the first time, our available cash has 
scarcely declined.
The dividend paid to shareholders in January this year  
increased to 0.40p per share from 0.32p, which is almost four 
times covered by earnings. The Board remain committed to a 
progressive dividend policy and have decided to recommend to 
shareholders that a final dividend of 0.20p be paid. The intention 
is that this will be paid in September and that the payment of the 
interim dividend for 2014 will be pushed back to March.
The Board are pleased to note that the average share price in 
the year was 12.71p compared to 11.47p in the previous year 
and just 8.76p in the year before that, and believe this reflects 
the Board’s commitment to the sustainable long term growth of 
the business.
Outlook
We have worked hard to build up a reputation with well 
established clients for high quality work and we see future 
growth both from our existing services and also from the 
addition of other services that are likely to be of assistance to 
those clients.
The work of the past few years is now showing through in the 
group’s financial performance and this is in turn being reflected 
more closely in the share price. Although there are risks to any 
business and these are considered in the Directors’ Report, the 
Board feel encouraged by the progress of the last year and are 
confident of further progress to come.
Staff
Our staff are absolutely crucial to the quality of service provided 
and to creating an environment where we can attract good 
quality people who want to come to work for us. The Board are 
most grateful to all the staff for their hard work and are gratified 
that so many of them are choosing to build their careers with  
the group.

CHAIRMAN’S STATEMENT red24

The group is organised into two segments, security assistance and business support,  
in which we use our business model to provide services to our clients.
Business model
The red24 business model has been developed in the security industry to provide assistance 
to individuals and organisations in managing their security risks. Assistance is provided on 
an escalating basis as threats develop:
Advice Support Response
This model enables the group to add value to clients enabling 
them to select the level of assistance they wish to embed 
in their own product and the level they wish to buy in on an 
ad hoc basis. Within the security industry this approach has 
enabled us to sustain margins as the business has expanded
and has led to opportunities to utilise the model to develop 
other business support services to clients. Security 
management training for the extractive industries and product 
safety assistance to the food industry, have been particular 
fields of success.

Security

Insurance 
Response Security Assistance
This segment comprises our global security service which 
provides preventative and reactive advice to help individuals 
and businesses avoid and manage personal risks to 
themselves, their staff and their families.
In addition to the advisory and support services which we 
provide on a volume mandatory basis to clients of HSBC and 
AIG, we also act as the designated adviser to a number of 
insurance companies who insure against special security risks. 
In this segment it is usual to find that 80% of the revenues
are fixed and approximately 20% derive from incidents for 
which a response is required. This adds greatly to the forward 
visibility of the business, particularly as most of these revenues 
are contracted for a period of three years at a time. We are 
particularly pleased that our contract with HSBC has been 
renewed for a further three years and now runs until 2017.
The day to day operation of the service is based in our Crisis 
Response Management Centre in Cape Town, which houses 
some 60 staff who provide security analysis and advice, 
customer service, response co-ordination and IT. This cost is 
largely fixed and supported by the contracted revenues.
Response work is inherently less predictable and generally 
involves the use of independent consultants, most of whom 
are trusted freelancers, but in some categories of business 
retained consultants are engaged. Although there were no 
major “headline” incidents this year we continued to be active, 
particularly in Africa and the Middle East.
In January we published our Threat Forecast 2013, which is 
available on our website www.red24.com and which itself has 
been significantly enhanced.
With the launch of our red24Assist service in late 2011 as 
a much enhanced offering in the product contamination 
insurance markets, we decided to include this product in 
the business support segment rather than security. Our old 
product contamination service was included in this segment 
and the migration of clients to the new service has been 
responsible for the fall in segment revenues, without which 
there would have been 2% growth in the year. Net margins 
have been maintained despite the fixed nature of the revenues 
and the impact of South African inflation on the cost base; this 
is largely due to the Rand declining over the course of the year 
to offset that impact. Acquisition of the premises helps to fix 
the cost of our second largest overhead.
Looking forward we are pleased that almost all clients are 
renewing when the time comes; albeit sometimes at lower 
income levels if their own revenues have not reached their 
expectations. We continue to attract new clients and are 
pleased to have attracted insurers from continental Europe 
and also our first credit card issuer. We anticipate that these 
developments will restore actual top line growth to this segment.
Business Support
This segment comprises the Arc Training International 
Academy for Security Management, our product safety 
advisory service, red24Assist, our environmental advisory 
service, green24, and a new cyber crime product.
Arc Training is one of the UK’s leading providers of security 
management training courses and one of the best-known 
international security management training companies in 
the world. The courses offer a range of qualifications and 
education for full-time security professionals and for managers 
for whom security is one of their key responsibilities. Each year 
a published programme of courses, open to all, is run in the 
UK and, increasingly overseas where they may be branded 
as Arc courses or be run in conjunction with local training 
partners. Revenues from this business grew by 9.5% in the 
year and again exceeded £1m.
As we anticipated, the passing of the Food Safety 
Modernization Act in the United States has introduced 
significant legislative requirements across the food industry 
in that country. This is a significant opportunity to use our 
business model to grow a business, almost from scratch, 
which is supported by teams of food specialists in the United 
States and in Europe, and by our website. Revenues fell just 
short of £1m, a significant increase on the £360k of revenue 
produced by the earlier product contamination service.

six
Whilst our environmental service has failed to produce 
stand alone revenues, the web based advice has been well 
received and is becoming a desired part of our overall offering, 
particularly red24Assist.
We see an opportunity to use our business model to develop a 
cyber-crime service to support insurers in the UK and this went 
live with our first insurer in April 2013. In the US roughly 50% of
businesses insure against cyber-crime, in the UK this 
percentage is 5% or less and we believe this will increase in 
the next few years as awareness of the issue grows. 
Overall revenues in this segment grew by 82%, of which 10% 
came from the training business and the rest from red24Assist. 
Increasing the breadth of the business support offering has 
led to improved margins, but they are still lower than those in 
security where there is a higher fixed cost base.
To date the group has been able to expand organically by 
recruiting appropriate specialists in the desired fields without 
the need for acquisitions. However the Board is mindful that 
acquisition remains an additional avenue to growth and, 
particularly in overseas markets, may be a more effective 
means of achieving growth.
Expansion in areas outside our reporting currency is affected 
by exchange rate movements. Almost half our revenue is now 
denominated in US dollars, even where our clients are the UK 
arm of US insurers, whereas 47% of our costs are incurred 
in rand. The Board are seeking to increase the proportion of 
costs that are incurred in US dollars and endeavouring to find 
sources of rand revenues. However exchange rate movements 
are influenced by many complex factors and the Board 
continues to believe that, although we do work to minimise the 
adverse impact, it is neither practical nor desirable to hedge 
these risks fully.

CHIEF ExECUTIVE’S REVIEW red24

The red24 brand and our corporate values are the key to our 
approach to Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR). Our CSR 
strategy is focused on the following key issues:
Business Ethics
The Board is committed to maintaining high ethical standards 
across the group and expect the same commitment from our 
staff, customers and suppliers. Our reputation is vital to our 
continued business success and we do not tolerate any form 
of bribery, corruption or fraud. We have anti-bribery policies
in place of which all employees are made aware when they join 
as well as through the group intranet and through training.
Employee Engagement
The Board recognise that our employees are fundamental to 
our success. As a professional services business we have a 
highly skilled workforce who assist in delivering our strategic 
objectives. The Board aim to ensure that there are equal 
opportunities for all employees and that decisions affecting
employees are taken based on merit and not on such factors 
as race, gender, nationality or religious beliefs. In South Africa 
there are legislative requirements that expect the workforce to 
be reflective of the mix of peoples in the Western Cape. The 
board regularly monitor progress towards this.
Many of the group’s employees have become shareholders 
through the share loan scheme. The Board consider that 
this would help the spread of share ownership through the 
workforce if an employee benefit trust were to be created, to 
enable leavers, particularly those based overseas, to sell, and 
new employees to purchase shares as well as to satisfy future 
awards of share options. The Board intend to progress this 
proposal in the coming year.
During the year the Board introduced optional defined 
contribution pension schemes for all staff based in either South 
Africa or the United Kingdom, along with the introduction of a 
death in service benefit.
Health and Safety
The Board are committed to providing a safe workplace for all 
our staff and to ensure that our services are provided in a way 
that delivers our services safely for clients and staff, including
contractors. Responsibility for health and safety rests with the 
Chief Executive. 
Sustainability
The Board monitor staffing requirements to ensure that staffing 
is regularly reviewed and appropriate plans put into place to 
ensure we retain and develop the necessary levels of skills and 
take action where needed.
We monitor our impact on the environment and work to 
minimise our impact. We measure our carbon footprint and 
work to reduce it and offset the balance by supporting the 
Cochabamba reforestation project in Bolivia.
In Cape Town we work with a local school to bring up young 
people who can engage in the workplace.
CORPORATE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITy red24

The directors present their report and the audited financial 
statements of the company and of the group for the year 
ended 31 March 2013.
PRINCIPAL ACTIVITIES, BUSINESS REVIEW, FUTURE 
DEVELOPMENTS, PRINCIPAL RISKS AND KEy 
PERFORMANCE INDICATORS
red24 plc is incorporated in Scotland and domiciled in 
England. Its shares are listed on the AIM Market (“AIM”) of 
the London Stock Exchange. The company acts as a holding 
company. The principal activities of its wholly-owned trading 
subsidiaries are the provision of security risk management and 
other assistance services. These activities are expected to 
continue for the foreseeable future.
A fair review of the business, and its future prospects, is 
contained in the Chairman’s Statement on pages 3 and in the 
Chief Executive’s review on pages 4 to 6. The Board considers 
the key performance indicators to be turnover, gross profit, 
profit before tax, earnings per share and available cash and 
the Board consider that the progress made in the second half 
of the year was satisfactory. The Board intend to adopt non-
financial key performance indicators in the coming year.
The Board exercises proper and appropriate corporate 
governance for the group. It ensures that there are effective 
systems of internal controls in place to manage the 
shareholders’ interests and the group’s assets, including the 
assessment and management of the risks to which the group’s
businesses are exposed.
There are a number of principal risks and uncertainties which 
could have a material effect on the group. Some of these 
risks and uncertainties are external to the group and largely 
outside the group’s control. Foremost amongst these is the 
economic environment, which remains a challenging one 
as many governments struggle with debt constraints. This 
has implications for the relative value of currencies, not least 
sterling, which is our reporting currency. The past two years 
have seen significant growth in our dollar revenues and costs, 
and we also have a significant rand cost base in South Africa. 
The impact of currency movements on our earnings cannot be 
reliably forecast and remains an area of uncertainty.
Risks and uncertainties that are largely within the control of 
the group include the achievement and collection of sufficient 
revenue to meet the group’s objectives. The group maintains 
significant cash reserves both to mitigate against the possibility 
of periods of reduced working capital and to ensure
adequate working capital is available to meet any sudden 
increase in the level of response work clients may require. 
Internally, the dependence on one or two key accounts for a 
significant proportion of our revenue remains a key risk but the 
Board is endeavouring to reduce this risk by broadening the
customer base. Other normal business risks include 
dependence on the continued availability of key personnel 
to ensure that our clients receive the level of service they are 
entitled to expect, and the ability of the group to continue to 
provide that level of service. The reputation of the group is 
critical to its continued success and it works hard to develop 
and protect that reputation by ensuring that it only
associates itself with activities that are appropriate for a 
business in its sector.
RESULTS FOR THE yEAR
The financial result for the year ended 31 March 2013 and the 
comparative result for the year ended 31 March 2012 are set 
out on page 17. An interim dividend of 0.40p per share (2012: 
0.32p) was paid on 17 January 2013. A final dividend of 0.20p 
per share (2012: £Nil) will be recommended to the AGM on 6 
August 2013, to be paid on 19 September 2013.

DIRECTORS’ REPORT red24
Annual report & accounts for the year ended 31 March 2013
As a company listed on the AIM Market of the London Stock 
Exchange, the Directors’ policy is, as far as is possible in 
relation to the group’s size, to manage the affairs of the group 
in accordance with the Financial Reporting Council’s UK 
Corporate Governance Code 2010 (“the Code”).
APPLICATION OF THE PRINCIPLES OF GOOD GOVERNANCE
The names of the directors and their respective responsibilities 
are shown on page 8. The Board presently consists of two 
executive directors and one non-executive director. The full 
Board meets regularly and receives appropriate information 
from management in advance of its meetings. Certain 
functions are delegated to Board Committees.
The Remuneration Committee is chaired by the non-executive 
director and consists of that director and the Chairman. Its  
key role is to make recommendations to the Board, within 
agreed terms of reference, on the Company’s framework  
of executive remuneration and its cost and to determine on  
behalf of the Board specific remuneration packages for the 
Executive Directors.
The Audit Committee consists of the Chairman and the non-
executive director, both of whom are Chartered Accountants. 
The Committee, which is chaired by the non-executive director, 
meets with the independent auditor to consider the group’s 
financial reporting in advance of its publication.
The Board considers that its structure is appropriate to its 
present stage of development and that the non-executive 
director is independent of the executives in both character  
and judgement.
INTERNAL CONTROL
The Board has overall responsibility for ensuring that the 
group maintains a system of internal control to provide it with 
reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of information 
used within the business and for publication and that assets 
are safeguarded. There are inherent limitations in any system 
of internal control and, accordingly, even the most effective 
system can provide only reasonable, and not absolute, 
assurance with respect to the preparation of financial 
information and the safeguarding of assets.
The key features of the internal control system that operated 
during the year may be summarised as follows:
•  Board responsibility for overall strategy and for approving 
budgets, forecasts and plans;
•  Board and business heads participate in the annual strategic 
planning process which sets the framework for the budgets 
of individual business units;
•  clear lines of authority, responsibility and financial 
accountability within each business unit, ensuring an 
appropriate organisational structure for planning, executing, 
controlling and monitoring its business operations;
•  consideration and review by the Board of monthly 
management accounts which compare actual results with

CORPORATE GOVERNANCE STATEMENT red24
Annual report & accounts for the year ended 31 March 2013
The Audit Committee reviews the operation and effectiveness 
of this framework on a regular basis and, on behalf of the 
Board, has reviewed the half yearly report and the annual 
financial statements along with the nature and scope of the 
external audit.
The directors consider that there have been no weaknesses 
in internal financial control that have resulted in any material 
losses, contingencies or uncertainties requiring disclosure in 
the group’s financial statements. 
RELATIONS WITH SHAREHOLDERS
The Chairman and Chief Executive make themselves available 
to major shareholders on request and periodically attend 
meetings with and presentations to shareholders. The Annual 
General Meeting is normally attended by all directors and 
shareholders are invited to ask questions during the meeting
and to meet with directors after the formal proceedings  
have ended.
GOING CONCERN
Having made enquiries, the directors have a reasonable 
expectation that the company and the group as a whole will 
have adequate resources to continue in operational existence 
for the foreseeable future. For this reason they continue to 
adopt the going concern basis in preparing the accounts.
AUDITOR INDEPENDENCE
The Audit Committee undertakes a formal assessment of the 
external auditor’s independence each year which includes:
•  a review of non-audit services provided to the group and 
related fees;
•  receipt from the auditor of a written report detailing 
relationships with the company and any other parties 
that could affect independence or the perception of 
independence;
•  a review of the auditor’s own procedures for ensuring 
independence of the audit firm and partners and staff 
involved in the audit, including the regular rotation of the  
audit partner; and
•  obtaining written confirmation from the auditor that, in their 
professional judgement, they are independent.
An analysis of the fees payable to the external audit firm in 
respect of both audit and non-audit services during the year is 
set out in note 4 to the financial statements.

DIRECTORS’ INTERESTS IN SHARES AND OPTIONS
The interests of the directors holding office at 31 March 2013 
in the company’s share capital, including share options and 
also including shares held by companies controlled by the 
directors, are shown in the directors’ report on page 9. The 
directors are not eligible to participate in the group’s share  
loan scheme.
The directors continue to believe that the success of the group 
will depend to a high degree on the future performance of the 
management team. On 8 August 2012 the Board awarded 
M S H Worsley-Tonks share options to subscribe to 750,000 
ordinary shares at a price of 10.5p per share at any anytime 
between 8 August 2015 and 8 August 2018. This reflected his 
contribution both to the continued profitability of the company 
and to the development of new revenue streams, which have
been the core of the organic growth this financial year.
Managers and staff are encouraged to take advantage of the 
group’s share loan scheme and actually purchase shares. 
The Board were pleased that the scheme was used by 19 
members of staff, who made commitments of £31,875 during 
the year. This brings to 32 the number of staff in the scheme,
representing 40% of the workforce.
The Board believe that the direct participation in the equity of 
the company leads to a significant reduction in staff turnover 
and is a far more effective method than the awarding of share 
options in ensuring that the longer term interests of staff and 
shareholders coincide. However, it is inevitable that some staff 
do leave and the Board believe it would be in the interests of 
all shareholders if the group had power to buy in the shares 
of those staff members. This is particularly the case for South 
African staff who do not have ready access to an AIM broker. 
Accordingly the Board are investigating the setting up of an 
Employee Benefit Trust during the coming year.

REMUNERATION REPORT red24
Annual report & accounts for the year ended 31 March 2013
The directors are responsible for preparing the Directors’ 
Report and the financial statements in accordance with 
applicable law and regulations.
Company law requires the directors to prepare group and 
company financial statements for each financial year. The 
directors are required by the AIM Rules of the London Stock 
Exchange to prepare group financial statements in accordance 
with International Financial Reporting Standards (“IFRS”) as
adopted by the European Union (“EU”) and have elected under 
company law to prepare the company financial statements in 
accordance with IFRS as adopted by the EU.
The financial statements are required by law and IFRS adopted 
by the EU to present fairly the financial position of the group 
and the company and the financial performance of the group. 
The Companies Act 2006 provides in relation to such financial 
statements that references in the relevant part of that Act to 
financial statements giving a true and fair view are references 
to their achieving a fair presentation.
Under company law the directors must not approve the 
financial statements unless they are satisfied that they give a 
true and fair view of the state of affairs of the group and the 
company and of the profit or loss of the group for that period.
In preparing the group and company financial statements, the 
directors are required to:
a.  select suitable accounting policies and then apply them 
consistently;
b.  make judgements and accounting estimates that are 
reasonable and prudent;
c.  state whether they have been prepared in accordance with 
IFRSs adopted by the EU;
d.  prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis 
unless it is inappropriate to presume that the group and the 
company will continue in business.
The directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting 
records that are sufficient to show and explain the group’s 
and the company’s transactions and disclose with reasonable 
accuracy at any time the financial position of the group and the 
company and enable them to ensure that the financial
statements comply with the Companies Act 2006. They are 
also responsible for safeguarding the assets of the group and 
the company and hence for taking reasonable steps for the 
prevention and detection of fraud and other irregularities.
The directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity 
of the corporate and financial information included on the 
red24 plc website.
Legislation in the United Kingdom governing the preparation 
and dissemination of financial statements may differ from 
legislation in other jurisdictions.

STATEMENT OF DIRECTORS’ 
RESPONSIBILITIES red24
Annual report & accounts for the year ended 31 March 2013
We have audited the group and parent company financial 
statements on pages 17 to 50. The financial reporting 
framework that has been applied in their preparation is 
applicable law and International Financial Reporting Standards 
(“IFRSs”) as adopted by the European Union and, as regards 
the parent company financial statements, as applied in 
accordance with the provisions of the Companies Act 2006.
This report is made solely to the company’s members, as 
a body, in accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the 
Companies Act 2006. Our audit work has been undertaken so 
that we might state to the company’s members those matters 
we are required to state to them in an auditor’s report and for
no other purpose. To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do 
not accept or assume responsibility to anyone other than the 
company and the company’s members as a body, for our audit 
work, for this report, or for the opinions we have formed.
Respective responsibilities of directors and auditor
As more fully explained in the Statement of Directors’ 
Responsibilities on page 16, the directors are responsible 
for the preparation of the financial statements and for being 
satisfied that they give a true and fair view. Our responsibility is 
to audit and express an opinion on the financial statements in
accordance with applicable law and International Standards 
on Auditing (UK and Ireland). Those standards require us to 
comply with the Auditing Practices Board’s (“APB’s”) Ethical 
Standards for Auditors.
Scope of the audit of the financial statements
A description of the scope of an audit of financial statements  
is provided on the APB’s website at
www.frc.org.uk/apb/scope/private.cfm
Opinion on financial statements
In our opinion
−  the financial statements give a true and fair view of the state 
of the group’s and of the parent’s affairs as at 31 March 2013  
 
 
 
and of the group’s profit for the year then ended;
−  the group financial statements have been properly prepared in 
accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the European Union;
−  the parent financial statements have been properly prepared 
in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the European Union 
and as applied in accordance with the Companies Act 2006;
and
−  the financial statements have been prepared in accordance 
with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006.
Opinion on other matter prescribed by the Companies 
Act 2006
In our opinion the information given in the Directors’ Report 
for the financial year for which the financial statements are 
prepared is consistent with the financial statements.
Matters on which we are required to report by exception
We have nothing to report in respect of the following matters 
where the Companies Act 2006 requires us to report to you if, 
in our opinion:
-  adequate accounting records have not been kept by the 
parent company, or returns adequate for our audit have not 
been received by branches not visited by us: or
-  the parent company financial statements are not in 
agreement with the accounting records and returns: or
-  certain disclosures of directors’ remuneration specified by law 
are not made; or
-  we have not received all the information and explanations we 
require for our audit.

NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
year ended 31 March 2013
1 Accounting policies
(a) Basis of preparation
From 1 April 2007, the group and company have adopted 
International Financial Reporting Standards (“IFRS”) and 
the International Financial Report Interpretations Committee 
(“IFRIC”) interpretations as adopted by the European Union 
(“EU”) in the preparation of its financial statements and those 
parts of the Companies Act 2006 applicable to companies 
reporting under IFRS. The financial statements have been
prepared under the historical cost basis.
The accounts are prepared on a going concern basis. 
In assessing whether the going concern assumption is 
appropriate, the directors have taken into account relevant
available information about the future including profit and cash 
forecasts for the next two financial years and the assumptions 
on which they are based. After reviewing this information, the 
directors consider that it is appropriate to prepare the financial
statements on a going concern basis.
(b) Basis of consolidation
The consolidated financial statements include the financial 
statements of the company and all of the entities controlled by 
the company (its subsidiaries) made up to 31 March each year. 
Control is achieved where the company has the power to
govern the financial and operating policies of an investee entity 
so as to obtain benefit from its activities. The acquisition of 
subsidiaries is accounted for using the acquisition method. The 
cost of an acquisition is measured as the cash paid and the
fair value of other assets given, equity instruments issued 
and liabilities incurred or assumed at the date of exchange 
of contracts. Costs directly attributable to the acquisition are 
expensed as incurred.
The results of subsidiaries sold or acquired are included in 
the consolidated income statement up to, or from, the date 
control passes. Where necessary, adjustments are made to 
the financial statements of subsidiaries to bring the accounting 
policies used into line with those used by the group. All intra-
group transactions, balances, income and expenses are 
eliminated on consolidation.
The company has not presented its own income statement  
as permitted by Section 408 of the Companies Act 2006.  
The profit for the year was £302,798 (2012:£423,520).
(c) Revenue recognition
Revenue represents the fair value of the consideration received 
or receivable in respect of services provided in the normal 
course of business, net of discounts, value added tax and 
other sales related taxes. Sales of services are recognised 
when the services have been provided, services invoiced in  
advance are treated as deferred income and income is accrued 
where services have been provided but not yet invoiced.
Interest income is accrued on a time-apportioned basis. 
Dividend income is accounted for when received.
(d) Cost of sales, gross profit and operating profit
Cost of sales represent the fair value of costs directly incurred 
in the supply of goods sold and services provided. Costs are 
recognised at the time when the goods have been supplied or 
the services have been provided. Costs relating to still to be
provided services are carried forward in other receivables to 
the extent it is considered probable they will be recovered.  
Gross profit is defined as revenue recognised less cost of sales.
Operating profit is arrived at after deducting all administrative 
expenses from gross profit, including restructuring and 
impairment costs, but before investment income and  
finance costs.
(e) Borrowing costs
All borrowing costs are recognised in the income statement 
in the period in which they are incurred. Interest costs 
are accrued on a time basis by reference to the principal 
outstanding at the effective interest rate applicable. red24

NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
year ended 31 March 2013
(f) Taxation
The tax credit or expense represents the sum of the current tax 
expense and deferred tax.
The tax currently payable is based on the taxable profit for the 
year. Taxable profit differs from net profit as reported in the 
income statements because it excludes items of income and 
expense that are taxable or deductible in other years and it 
further excludes items that are never taxable or deductible. The 
group’s liability for current tax is calculated using the applicable 
rate for the period the taxable profits are earned in.
Deferred tax is provided in full, using the liability method, on  
temporary differences arising between the tax bases of  
assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts in the  
financial statements.
Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is 
probable that future taxable profits will be available against 
which the temporary differences can be utilised.
Deferred tax is measured at the average tax rates that are 
expected to apply in the periods in which timing differences are 
expected to reverse, based on tax rates and laws that have 
been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet 
date. Deferred tax is measured on a non-discounted basis. 
Deferred tax is charged or credited in the income statement, 
except where it relates to items charged or credited directly to 
equity, in which case the deferred tax is also dealt with in equity.
Deferred tax is provided on temporary timing differences arising 
on investments in subsidiary companies, except where the 
timing of the reversal of the temporary difference is controlled 
by the group and it is probable that the temporary difference 
will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
(g) Intangible assets
Goodwill, being the excess of the cost of acquisition over 
the fair value of net assets, including any intangible assets 
identified, acquired, is capitalised. Goodwill is not amortised 
but is tested at least annually for impairment and carried at 
cost less accumulated impairment provisions.
Goodwill is allocated to cash generating units for the purpose 
of impairment testing. If the recoverable amount of the cash 
generating unit is less than the carrying amount of the unit, then 
any goodwill is considered to be impaired. Impairment losses 
recognised for goodwill are not reversed in subsequent periods. 
The recoverable amounts of the cash generating units are 
determined from value in use calculations. The group prepares 
cash flow forecasts from the most recent financial budgets 
approved by management. The cash flows are then discounted 
at an appropriate interest rate to determine value in use.
Intellectual properties, including computer software licences, 
websites and training courses are capitalised at cost and are 
amortised on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful 
economic lives of between one and three years.
(h) Property, plant & equipment and depreciation
Property, plant and equipment is valued at cost less 
accumulated depreciation and less provisions for impairment. 
Depreciation is provided at the following annual rates
in order to write off each asset, on a straight-line basis, over its 
estimated useful life:
Buildings 3% per annum
Fixtures, fittings and equipment 16.67% to 50% per annum
Motor vehicles 20% per annum
The depreciation charge is time apportioned in the year of 
acquisition and disposal of assets.
(i) Product development
Product development is written off to the income statement as 
incurred unless the directors are satisfied as to the technical, 
commercial and financial viability of individual projects. In this 
situation, the expenditure is deferred and amortised over
the period during which the company is expected to benefit.
(j) Foreign currency translation
The individual financial statements of each group company 
are presented in the currency of the primary economic 
environment in which it operates (its functional currency). red24
Annual report & accounts for the year ended 31 March 2013
(j) Foreign currency translation
For the purposes of the consolidated financial statements, 
the results and financial position of each group company are 
expressed in sterling, which is the functional currency of the 
company, and the presentation currency for the consolidated 
financial statements.
In preparing the financial statements of the individual companies, 
transactions expressed in currencies other than the entity’s 
functional currency (foreign currencies) are at rates of exchange 
approximating to those ruling at the date of the transaction.  
At each balance sheet date, monetary assets and liabilities that 
are denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at rates 
ruling at the balance sheet date. Non monetary items that are 
measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are  
not retranslated.
Exchange differences arising on the settlement of monetary 
items, and on the retranslation of monetary items, are included 
in the profit or loss before tax for the period.
In presenting the consolidated financial statements the assets 
and liabilities of the overseas subsidiary are translated at the 
rate ruling at the balance sheet date. The results of the overseas 
subsidiary have been translated at the average exchange rate 
ruling during the year. Differences arising on retranslation are 
added to or deducted from the group’s translation reserve.
(k) Financial assets
Trade receivables, loans and other receivables that have fixed or 
determinable payments that are not quoted in an active market 
are classified as “Loans and receivables”. These receivables are 
initially recognised at fair value and subsequently measured at 
their amortised cost using the effective interest rate method less 
any provision for impairment.
Financial assets are assessed for indications of impairment at 
each balance sheet date. Financial assets are impaired where 
there is objective evidence that as a result of one or more events 
that occurred after the initial recognition of the financial asset the 
estimated future cash flows of the asset have been impacted. 
For trade and other receivables the carrying amount is reduced 
by an allowance reflecting the impairment. When a trade 
receivable is uncollectible it is written off against the allowance, 
subsequent recoveries of amounts previously written off are 
credited against the allowance account. Changes in the carrying 
amount of the allowance are reflected in the income statement.
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash in hand and on 
demand deposits, and other short-term highly liquid investments 
that are readily convertible to a known amount of cash and are 
subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value.
(l) Financial liabilities and equity
Financial liabilities and equity are classified according to the 
substance of the contracted arrangements entered into. An 
equity instrument is any contract that evidences a residual 
interest in the assets of the group after deducting all its
liabilities. Equity instruments are recorded at the proceeds 
received, net of direct issue costs.
The component parts of compound instruments are classified 
separately as financial liabilities and equity in accordance with 
the substance of the transaction. At the date of issue the fair 
value of the liability is estimated using the prevailing market 
interest rate for a similar non-convertible instrument. This 
amount is recorded as a liability on an amortised cost basis until 
extinguished on conversion or upon the instrument reaching 
maturity. The equity component is determined by deducting 
the amount of the liability component from the fair value of the 
compound instrument as a whole. This is recognised in equity 
through other reserves and is not subsequently remeasured.
Other financial liabilities are initially measured at fair value, net 
of transaction costs, and subsequently at amortised cost using 
the effective interest method. Interest bearing bank loans and 
overdrafts together with obligations under finance leases are
classified as “Borrowings”.

(m) Net cash
Net cash is defined as the excess of cash and cash 
equivalents over borrowings.
(n) Investments
Non-current investments representing investments in 
subsidiary undertakings are valued at cost less any provision 
for impairment in the value of the investment.
(o) Dividends
Dividend payments are recognised as liabilities once they are 
appropriately authorised and no longer at the discretion of  
the company.
(p) Share based payments
The group issues equity-settled share based payments to 
certain employees. Equity settled share based payments 
are measured at fair value at the date of grant. The fair value 
determined at the grant date is expensed on a straight line 
basis over the vesting period, based on the group’s estimate of 
options that will eventually vest. Fair value is measured by use 
of the Black Scholes model. The assumptions underlying
the number of awards expected to vest are subsequently 
adjusted to reflect conditions prevailing at the balance sheet 
date. At the vesting date of an award, the cumulative expense 
is adjusted to take account of the awards that actually vest.
The group has issued warrants to subscribers of certain equity 
issues and to a distributor and these are measured at fair value 
at the date of grant in the same way as employee related share 
based payments.
(q) Leased assets and obligations
An asset is acquired when substantially all the risks and rewards 
are transferred and is capitalised as an asset under a finance 
lease with the corresponding liability to the finance company 
included in trade and other payables. Depreciation on assets 
held under finance leases is provided in accordance with the 
policy noted in (h) above. Finance lease payments are treated 
as consisting of capital and interest elements and the interest 
is charged to the income statement on a constant rate basis 
over the period of the agreement. Finance charges are charged 
directly to income. All other leases are operating leases. 
Rentals receivable or payable under operating leases are 
credited or charged to the income statement on a straight line 
basis over the lease term.
(r) Adoption of new and revised standards
In the current financial year the group has adopted the 
following improvements to IFRSs which were effective for this 
financial period. These have had no material impact on the 
financial statements of the Group:
• Annual improvements to IFRSs 2011;
At the date of authorisation of these financial statements, the 
following Standards and Interpretations, which have not yet 
been applied in these financial statements, were in issue but 
not yet effective:
• IAS 1 ‘Amendments to accounting standards’;
• IAS 19 ‘Employee benefits’;
• IAS 27 ’Separate financial statements’;
• IAS 28 ‘Investments in associates and joint ventures’;
• IAS 32 ’Offsetting financial assets and financial liabilities’;
• IFRS 9 ’Financial Instruments’;
• IFRS 10 ’Consolidated financial statements’;
• IFRS 11 ’Joint arrangements’;
• IFRS 12 ’Disclosure of interests in other entities’;
• IFRS 13 ‘Fair value measurement’.
The directors do not anticipate that they will have a material 
impact on the financial statements.

2  Critical accounting judgements and key sources  
of estimation uncertainty
Estimates and judgements are evaluated on a continual basis  
and are based on historical experience together with 
expectations of future events believed to be reasonable at the 
time. In considering the possible impairment of intangible  
assets and in recognising deferred tax assets, estimates of 
future revenues are particularly critical. The directors have 
prepared forecasts of revenues and expenses covering the  
next two financial years to assist in the making of estimates  
and judgements.
In the process of applying the group’s accounting policies, which 
are described in note 1, the directors have made the following 
judgements that have the most significant effect on the
amounts recognised in the financial statements.
Revenue recognition
Much of the group’s revenue comes from business that relates to 
the provision of services over a period of time. Invoiced revenue 
may cover more than one accounting period and these revenues 
are time apportioned to the accounting period to which they 
relate and the obligation for future service is shown in deferred 
income. Even after recognition as revenue on a time apportioned 
basis, there may be uncertainty as to the costs relating to these 
revenues for some time afterwards and there may remain an 
obligation for future service. An estimate of this obligation has 
been made by the directors, using their experience of similar 
contracts, and deducted from recognised revenue.
3 Revenue and segment analysis
For management purposes the group is currently organised 
into two divisions – security assistance and business support. 
This reflects how the group reports its management information 
to the Chief Operating Decision Maker which is deemed to be 
the group board of directors. The security assistance segment 
provides preventative and reactive security advice to customers 
across the globe, whilst the business support segment 
comprises training in security management, the provision of 
advice on product safety with particular emphasis on food  
and the provision of web based environmental advice.

8  Share based payments
The company has issued share options to certain directors and 
employees. The options cannot be exercised in the first three 
years following their grant and, under normal circumstances, 
the options lapse if an employee leaves the group.
On 16 April 2004, the company granted 1,595,000 options to 
subscribe for ordinary shares of 1p each under the company’s 
general share option scheme, exercisable at 18.75p per share
between 16 April 2006 and 15 April 2014 and not subject to 
any performance conditions.
On 2 March 2010, the company granted 500,000 options to 
subscribe for ordinary shares of 1p each under the company’s 
executive share option scheme, exercisable at 8p per share
between 31 March 2013 and 31 March 2016 and not subject 
to any performance conditions. 
On 8 November 2011, the company granted 500,000 
options to subscribe for ordinary shares of 1p each under the 
company’s executive share option scheme, exercisable at 
10.5p per share between 8 November 2014 and 8 November 
2017 and not subject to any performance conditions. These 
options were cancelled on 8 August 2012 when a new grant 
of 750,000 options was made. The exercise price is also 
10.5p per share and is also not subject to any performance 
conditions. These options may be exercised at any time 
between 8 August 2015 and 8 August 2018.

The goodwill acquired in a business combination is allocated, 
at acquisition, to the cash generating segments that are 
expected to benefit from that business combination. At the 
date of transition to IFRS the carrying amount of goodwill 
had been allocated as red24 segment £136,020 and training 
segment £120,000.
The group tests goodwill annually for impairment or more 
frequently if there are indications that goodwill might be impaired. 
Charges for amortisation and impairment of goodwill and 
intellectual property are included within administrative expenses.
The recoverable amounts of the cash generating units are 
determined from value in use calculations. The group prepares 
cash flow forecasts from the most recent financial budgets
approved by management. The cash flows are then  discounted 
at an appropriate interest rate to determine value in use.
The forecast cash flows for the next two years, taking forecast 
revenues, based upon historical experience, and anticipated 
expenditure are then discounted at a rate of ten percent per 
annum to arrive at a recoverable amount for each cash 
generating unit. This shows that each cash generating unit 
has a recoverable amount in excess of the carrying value of 
goodwill and that no charge for impairment in necessary.
The key assumptions are those regarding discount rate, 
growth rates, expected sales and direct costs during the 
period. Growth forecasts are based on the experience of the 
past three years. A discount rate of 10% has been applied 
based on the cost of loan capital.

shares of R1 each. The company has waived its right to the dividend due on these shares up to 31 March 2013. For the year to  
31 March 2013 this would have amounted to R65,000 (£5,835).

assets of that subsidiary exceed its net liabilities. 
Each year the company reviews the carrying value of the investment in each subsidiary against the amount estimated to be recoverable 
from that subsidiary, if recovery is not reasonably foreseeable then the investment is considered impaired and a charge made.

(i) The average credit period on sales of services is 80 days 
(2012: 69 days). Trade receivables over 120 days at the 
balance sheet date, that have not been received within 60 
days of the balance sheet date, are provided for in full, less 
any element of deferred income. Other trade receivables 
over 60 days at the balance sheet date are provided for on 
estimated irrecoverable amounts. The carrying value of trade 
and other receivables is considered to be the same as their 
fair value.
Included in trade receivables are receivables with a carrying
amount of £450,550 (2012: £425,904) that are designated 
in foreign currencies, of which £440,010 (2012: £414,083) 
are designated in US dollars and £10,540 (2012: £11,821) in 
other currencies.
Included in the group’s trade receivables are debtors with a 
carrying amount of £438,719 (2012: £281,897) which are 
overdue at the balance sheet date for which the group has 
not provided as there has not been a significant change in 
credit quality and the group believes that these amounts are 
still recoverable. The group does not hold any collateral over 
these balances. The ageing of amounts past due but not 
impaired is as follows:

The red24 product is sold through key distributors, which does lead to a significant concentration of credit risk. These distributors 
are major global concerns and this limits the risk. At the balance sheet date £159,051 (2012: £372,935) was due to the group 
from key distributors and is included within trade and other receivables.

26 Financial instruments and risk summary (continued)
(a) Financial risk policies and objectives (continued)
The Board’s principal objective in managing its financial assets and liabilities is to ensure that the operating units have sufficient 
working capital for their day-to-day needs. Surplus cash is maintained on call deposits with the clearing bankers to the operating 
units, as the group is not yet sufficiently cash generative to warrant a separate treasury function or take advantage of greater returns 
that may be available from other sources or maturities. The group does derive income in overseas currencies, principally the US 
dollar, and does incur expenses in overseas currencies, principally the costs of its South African operation which is Rand based. No 
forward contracts have been entered into to hedge these exposures.
(b) Capital risk management
The directors consider the company’s capital comprises its share capital and reserves and bank and other loans. In general the 
group finances its operations from equity share issues and from the retention of profits. To ensure that equity markets remain open 
to the group as a source of capital, the market price of the group’s shares is regularly reviewed by the Board, to check it remains 
above par value. In the last year the group has increased its investment in South Africa quite considerably by purchasing the 
property there; this purchase was financed through a combination of retained earnings and locally sourced bank finance to act as a 
hedge against country and currency risk.
(c) Foreign currency risk and sensitivity
The group has two overseas subsidiaries whose functional currencies are Rand and another whose functional currency is US 
dollars. In addition the group undertakes transactions denominated in foreign currencies, principally US dollars, hence exposures 
to exchange rate fluctuations arise. The carrying amount of the group’s foreign currency denominated financial assets and financial 
liabilities at the reporting date is as follows:  
Assets Liabilities
2013
£
2012
£
2013
£
2012

Rand 143,611 180,276 512,030 69,440
Dollar 927,601 814,756 104,179 45,028
Other currencies 3,727 13,108 13,137 8,264
1,074,939 1,008,140 629,346 122,732
The company does not have any exposure to foreign currencies as all its transactions are in sterling. The group’s exposure to the 
Rand is such that were the Rand to appreciate by 10% against sterling the cost of its operations in South Africa would rise by 
£157,241 (2012: £147,842), this would be mitigated by a rise in the value in the group’s Rand assets of £66,283 (2012: £23,483). 
The group’s exposure to the US dollar is such that were the dollar to depreciate by 10% against sterling profit would be reduced 
by £100,926 (2012: £137,432). The Board are aware that these are significant risks and the impact of currency movements on 
earnings cannot be reliably forecast and remains an area of uncertainty.

26 Financial instruments and risk summary (continued)
(d) Market risk
The group’s activities expose it to the financial risks of changes in foreign currency exchange rates (see section (c)) and interest rates 
(see section (g)). As explained above, the group has, for the present, accepted exposure to these risks.
(e) Liquidity risk 
Ultimate responsibility for liquidity risk management rests with the board of directors, which regularly reviews the short, medium and 
long term funding and liquidity requirements. As a general principle the board consider that equity remains the most appropriate 
source of funds for the business and endeavours to maintain access to equity capital markets to fund medium and long term 
liquidity requirements. However, where significant overseas investments are contemplated an evaluation of currency, country and 
other risk factors are taken into account and opportunities to finance a proportion of that investment locally will be considered. 
Financial assets are maintained on short term deposit to assist with the management of day-to-day working capital requirements.
(f) Fair value of financial instruments
There is no material difference between the fair value and carrying value of financial assets and liabilities.
(g) Interest rate risk  
The group has financial assets of £3,525,849 at 31 March 2013 (2012: £3,211,018) comprising cash deposits and trade and other 
receivables. Trade and other receivables have been excluded from the following tables as they are non-interest bearing.

(h) Credit risk
Credit risk refers to the risk that a counterparty will default on its contractual obligations resulting in financial loss to the group. The 
group has a credit policy of only dealing with creditworthy counterparties as a means of mitigating this risk. The group’s exposure to 
credit risk is monitored on a monthly basis and remedial action taken where appropriate.
Despite the above policies there does remain a concentration of credit risk in that two customers, one a major bank and the other 
a major insurance company, constitute 32.8% (2012: 34.1%) of the group’s trade and other receivables. These receivables are 
within their trading terms but nonetheless present an ongoing risk. The group is endeavouring to mitigate this risk by gaining new 
customers at a faster rate than business with these two counterparties develops. 
The group’s maximum exposure to credit risk on its financial assets is £3,525,849 (2012: £3,211,018). For the company its 
maximum exposure, excluding amounts due from subsidiaries, is £777,838 (2012: £858,496). The group does not hold any 
collateral against these financial assets.
27 Contingent liabilities
The company has a contingent liability in respect of the value added tax of certain subsidiary companies under a group registration 
and is therefore jointly and severally liable for all the other group companies’ debt in this respect.  At 31 March 2013 the maximum 
potential liability was £99,381 (2012: £62,908).
The company disposed of interests in a number of leasehold properties during the 15 months to 31 March 2002 but retains a 
contingent liability in respect of one of those properties should the assignees fail to fulfil their obligations under the lease. For this 
lease, which expires in 2013 and where the annual rent is £135,000, the assignee’s obligations are guaranteed by a major clearing 
bank. The directors consider it unlikely that there will be any cost to the company.

genelenergy.com THE GENEL STORY 
1: Maintain the highest level  
of corporate governance
The strength of our management team, and an experienced 
Board, provides the expertise to grow the business and the 
governance necessary to maintain the integrity of the Company 
and effectively manage risk.
2: Maximise the value of our  
KRI oil assets and commercialise  
our KRI gas business
Our oil production in the KRI is managed to ensure long-term 
value creation, with production maximised over the life of the 
field and investment made at a level appropriate to the external 
environment. During 2015 production averaged 84,900 bopd,  
a rise of 22%. Our world-class Miran and Bina Bawi fields 
contain an estimated 11 tcf of mean raw gas resources, and  
steps have been taken to move them towards development.
3: Create value with the drill bit
We are committed to realising the value in our portfolio through  
a focused drilling programme to explore, appraise and develop 
our assets, with the flexibility in our portfolio allowing us to 
manage expenditure appropriately.
4: Pursue selective, accretive M&A 
opportunities 
Leverage the skills and knowledge of the management team to 
identify upstream assets with a view to adding reserves and/or 
resources which complement the existing KRI position.
5: Return excess cash to shareholders
We will continue to evaluate and evolve our capital structure to 
reflect the needs of the business, with a view to returning capital 
to investors when appropriate.
Our st r at egy for developing a major oil and gas business
Monetise at all points of the exploration, 
development and production cycle
Oil production in the KRI provides ongoing cash generation.  
We will aim to bring in partners to our KRI gas business with a 
view to crystallising value, reduce future funding requirements 
and delivering an appropriate balance of risk and reward.
Retain a strong balance sheet
The Company aims to retain a strong balance sheet and 
flexibility in our capital structure in order to pursue its  
strategic objectives and underpin future growth.
Leverage our unique regional relationships
Genel’s long-term presence in the Kurdistan Region of Iraq has 
allowed us to build lasting and beneficial relationships with the 
KRG and the local business community. These, allied with our 
Turkish heritage, play a vital role in creating value for 
shareholders. 
Responsible operations
The way in which we conduct ourselves with our host 
communities and governments, and our record on health,  
safety and the environment, is the bedrock for all of our 
operations, and is crucial to our success as a business.

Our oil reserves are being produced at some of the lowest costs  
in the industry and are cash flow breakeven at a Brent oil price of 
less than $20/bbl. The KRI gas development will also benefit from 
an industry leading cost structure. Our gas resources have been 
independently certified and are already committed by the KRI for 
export to Turkey, which will both diversify and lower the cost of 
energy imports.
As the economic situation in the region improves – driven by  
an improving oil price, increased oil exports, or KRG cost-cutting 
measures – regular export payments will facilitate the 
commercialisation of our gas assets. The clarity over the payment 
schedule for our oil exports allows us to explore and appraise, at  
low cost, a number of other exciting opportunities in our portfolio.
Our KRI gas business has the potential to generate a material and  
stable free cash flow stream once onstream. These cash flows, 
combined with those from the oil assets, will be redeployed to create 
value for shareholders in other upstream assets, or returned to 
shareholders if such opportunities don’t meet internal criteria. 
STRATEGIC REPORT
03
Genel Energy plc Annual Report 2015
genelenergy.com About the Kurdistan 
Region of Iraq
Robust long-term  
market fundamentals
Despite the significant challenges faced by  
the Kurdistan Regional Government, action  
is being taken to ensure a prosperous future. 
which has boosted the total population by 
30%. These displaced peoples have been 
sheltered by the KRG, whose efforts 
alongside NGOs have helped to prevent a 
full-scale humanitarian catastrophe. The 
financial strain of this support, compounded 
with the fall in the oil price and the failure  
of Baghdad to make budgetary payments, 
has left the KRG struggling to pay its salary 
obligations and recompense oil companies 
for their production.
Oil export growth
In order to compensate the Kurdistan 
Region of Iraq for the significant revenue 
shortfalls due to budgetary non-compliance 
by the Iraqi federal government, in June 
2015 the KRG resumed its policy of direct  
oil sales via the Turkish port of Ceyhan.
With oil exports absolutely vital to economic 
self-sufficiency, the export of crude oil rose 
throughout the year as upgrades to the 
pipeline network increased export capacity. 
Exports also included the flow of oil from  
the Kirkuk field, with the KRG continuing its 
cooperation with the North Oil Company to 
maximise flows.
The success of the KRI is intrinsically linked 
with the success of the oil industry, and the 
KRG has repeatedly affirmed its awareness 
that in order for IOCs to maintain and grow 
oil production, payments for oil exports 
need to be forthcoming.
Despite the severe economic difficulties,  
the KRG made payments for the last four 
With a population of 5.2 million, the 
Kurdistan Region of Iraq comprises the 
governorates of Erbil, Suleimaniah, and 
Dohuk. It covers 40,000 km
2
, bordering 
Turkey to the north and Iran to the east.  
Due to events in the region, the semi-
autonomous KRI has increasingly found 
itself the focus of the attention of the 
international community.
The fight against ISIS
The Kurdistan Regional Government has 
been a crucial partner in the global fight 
against ISIS. The KRI is on the front line  
of the fight, with the Peshmerga proving 
themselves as the most effective force,  
best able to repel ISIS, on the ground.
During and after the initial ISIS offensive  
in 2014, the KRG successfully defended  
the integrity of its borders, and the  
Region has remained safe and secure.  
Since the initial ISIS offensive, when the  
KRG prevented Kirkuk from falling into ISIS 
hands, the Peshmerga has retained control 
of 27,000 km
2
 from ISIS. Crucially, this 
included the November 2015 liberation of 
Sinjar, which split the ISIS controlled area in 
half, cutting supply lines and weakening its 
grip on Mosul and other territories in Iraq.
Challenging economic situation
The necessary fight against ISIS has been 
expensive, placing a major burden on the 
KRI’s economy, which is currently in crisis. 
As well as funding the Peshmerga, the  
KRI hosts over 1.8 million refugees and 
internally displaced persons (‘IDPs’),  
months of 2015, and has now formalised  
a payment procedure that will see 
companies paid monthly based on 
contractual entitlements, with a further 
payment towards the recovery of 
outstanding receivables.
Regional relationships
While the tentative agreement, made at the 
end of 2014, with the Federal Government  
of Iraq (‘FGI’) broke down, the relationship 
between Baghdad and Erbil remains civil. 
Both the KRG and FGI have stated their 
willingness to discuss issues and find a 
cooperative solution to any differences. 
The KRG’s relationship with Turkey remains 
strong. An inconclusive general election 
result in June 2015 was followed by the 
Justice and Development Party (AKP) 
returning to single-party government in 
November. Throughout the period the 
mutually beneficial relationship enjoyed  
by Erbil and Ankara remained strong. 
Turkey remains comfortably the KRI’s largest 
trading partner, exporting billions of dollars 
worth of goods and services. This economic 
relationship will be solidified once the KRI 
fulfils its obligations under the Turkey-KRI 
Gas Sales Agreement, which will see an initial 
10 bcma delivered to Turkey in 2019/20.
Turkey remains one of the world’s fastest 
growing, major gas markets, and this 
provision of gas, which will be supplied by 
Genel’s Miran and Bina Bawi assets, will be 
transformational for the economy of the 
Kurdistan Region of Iraq. The import of KRI 
gas, which is far more strategic than KRI oil,  
is set to significantly reduce Turkey’s gas 
import costs.
While tensions between Turkey and the PKK 
flared up in the middle of 2015, unrest did  
not spread into the Kurdistan Region,  
indeed KRG-Turkey energy cooperation 
strengthened. Sabotage of the KRI-Ceyhan 
pipeline by PKK affiliates was strongly 
condemned by the KRG, and such incidents 
became rarer, making a minimal impact  
on oil exports at the end of the year.

“We have been a partner of the KRG for many 
years, and we recognise the efforts that have 
been made to meet its commitments in difficult 
circumstances. ”
Murat Özgül
Chief Executive Officer
Well over a decade of 
operating in the Kurdistan 
Region of Iraq has allowed 
us to build meaningful and 
beneficial relationships,  
and we are proud that our 
partnership with the KRG 
has made a valuable 
contribution to the 
development of the region.
Political developments in the KRI
Relations between the parties that make up 
the KRG have come under increasing strain 
over the presidency of Massoud Barzani, 
whose mandate expired on 20 August 2015 
but remains in office. The two main parties, 
the KDP and PUK, continue to work 
together to help overcome the difficulties 
facing the KRI, and President Barzani has 
affirmed that he will meet all political 
parties in the Kurdistan Region to reach  
a consensus on outstanding issues.
Catalysts for growth
The key issue facing the Kurdistan Region  
of Iraq remains the state of the economy. 
There are three ways in which the situation 
can be mitigated. While the first one, the oil 
price, cannot be affected by the KRG, the 
government is focusing on the two things 
that it can control – the volume of oil  
exports and reducing government costs  
and energy subsidies.
The upgrading of the KRG’s export 
infrastructure, which is ongoing, has allowed 
oil exports to hit record levels, and the KRG 
has committed to cutting its costs. Prime 
Minister Nechirvan Barzani has stated that 
steps to be taken include overhauling the 
taxation system, reducing allowances of 
higher ranking staff, implementing other 
financial reforms, reforming the electricity 
sector and reducing energy subsidies.

KEY PERFORMANCE INDICATORS
NET 2P RESERVES NET UNRISKED RESERVES  
AND RESOURCES
NET PRODUCTION 
The largest holder of reserves  
and resources in the Kurdistan 
Region of Iraq
Definition
2P reserves are proved plus  
probable reserves.
Performance
A review of the Taq Taq field reserves, 
following production declines seen 
during 2015, resulted in a revision  
of gross 2P reserves at the field to  
172 mmbbls, 76 mmbbls net to Genel.  
A significant part of this reduction  
was due to a revised assumption  
on the fracture porosity within the 
Shiranish, the shallowest interval of  
the three Cretaceous producing units. 
Production at Taq Taq and Tawke  
of 42 mmbbls and 49 mmbbls 
respectively also contributed  
to the fall in 2P reserves. 
Definition
Our oil production in the KRI is 
managed to ensure long-term value 
creation, with production maximised 
over the life of the field. It is measured 
in barrels of oil produced per day.
Performance
Oil production at both Taq Taq and 
Tawke benefited from an improvement 
in production facilities and, with the 
pipeline infrastructure fully functional 
for the whole year, outflow was  
not constrained.
Definition
Net reserves and resources include 
reserves, and contingent and 
prospective resources.
Performance
The acquisition of OMV’s stake in Bina 
Bawi increased Genel’s working interest 
in the licence, in turn increasing the 
contingent resources net to Genel by 
300 mmboe. An increase in prospective 
resources of the same magnitude at the 
Sidi Moussa licence, offshore Morocco, 
was the result of integrated post-well 
analysis and the identification of 
alternative play concepts.
Limited remaining prospectivity  
in other Moroccan assets and a 
disappointing drilling result offshore 
Côte d’Ivoire resulted in the decision  
to relinquish these licences. As part  
of Genel’s portfolio management, the 
Ber Bahr and Dohuk licences were also 
exited in the Kurdistan Region of Iraq, 
as was the Adigala Block, Ethiopia.

CAPITAL EXPENDITURE LOST TIME INCIDENTS SPILLS – LOSS OF  
PRIMARY CONTAINMENT
Definition
Genel aims to derisk and increase the 
value of assets by capital development 
and exploration.
Performance
Capital expenditure outlay is  
diligently managed to ensure the 
continued strength of our balance 
sheet, and the flexibility in our  
portfolio allows expenditure to be 
focused, targeted and appropriate  
to the external environment.
In light of the ongoing weakness  
in the oil price and the delay in the  
receipt of export payments, the  
capital expenditure programme  
for 2015 was materially reduced,  
with the year-on-year fall also 
exacerbated by a significant  
reduction in expenditure on  
African exploration assets.
Definition
Loss of primary containment records 
any unplanned or uncontrolled release 
of material from a piece of equipment 
(such as a pipe, vessel or tank) used for 
containment of potentially harmful or 
hazardous substances and products.
Performance
Asset integrity is a key priority for the 
company and we plan and execute the 
operations of our business and our 
engagement of subcontractors so as  
to minimise risk and mitigate potential 
impact, aiming for zero incidents. 
In 2015 there was a single incident at 
Chia Surkh, relating to an unplanned 
gas release. The incident did not lead  
to any harm for either employees or  
the environment. As always, a full 
investigation of the incident was 
undertaken and lessons learned. 
Definition
The safety of our workforce remains  
of paramount importance. Genel  
is committed to running safe and 
reliable operations across our portfolio, 
aiming at zero fatalities and no lost  
time incidents (‘LTIs’). Lost time 
incident frequency measures the 
number of lost time incidents per 
million work hours.
Performance
The reduction in incidents, from an 
already low base - and another year  
of zero fatalities - reflects continuing 
progress achieved in our safety culture 
and performance. The figure includes 
both Genel Energy, relating to which 
there were zero incidents, and TTOPCO 
figures. Note that the previous year’s 
figure has been rebased to include  
LTIs at TTOPCO.

genelenergy.com CHAIRMAN’S STATEMENT
Resetting the business  
in challenging times
Low-cost production, flexibility in the portfolio, 
and the financial strength to pursue our strategy.
Tony Hayward 
Chairman
I am pleased to welcome you to Genel 
Energy’s fifth annual report. 2015 was  
a challenging year across the oil sector  
as a whole. The sustained low oil price  
has placed a significant strain on both  
the industry and the economy of the 
Kurdistan Region of Iraq. 
As the external environment has 
deteriorated, we have been proactive  
in ensuring that your Company remains 
robust. Our production costs are amongst 
the lowest globally, and our asset base 
allows us to flex our capital expenditure 
programme to align with our cashflow  
and to preserve a robust balance sheet. 
Despite the reserve reassessment and write 
down at Taq Taq, which is very disappointing, 
our asset base remains strong, with many 
years of production ahead of us.
Despite the difficulties of the external 
environment, 2015 saw record production for 
Genel, up 22%. Payments for pipeline exports 
in the second half of the year, followed by a 
payment mechanism being confirmed in 2016, 
both demonstrated the firm commitment of 
the Kurdistan Regional Government to fully 
compensate IOCs for all production, both in 
the past and going forward.
The Kurdistan Region of Iraq oil industry
The Kurdistan Region of Iraq remains safe 
and secure, and our operations have been 
unaffected by the ongoing presence of ISIS 
in Iraq and Syria. The ISIS offensives against 
the KRI in 2014 were successfully repelled, 
and the terrorist group was very much on 
the defensive throughout 2015. Significant 
ground was retaken by the Peshmerga, with 
the support of its allies, and ISIS has seen  
its supply lines cut and increasing pressure 
placed on those areas west of the KRI which 
remain under its control.
10
Genel Energy plc Annual Report 2015
genelenergy.com While we continue to monitor the situation, 
we do not expect ISIS to have any 
operational impact on the KRI oil industry 
going forward. The main impact ISIS has  
is on the economy of the region, with the 
funding of the Peshmerga and provision  
of support for refugees and internally 
displaced peoples (‘IDPs’) causing a  
strain on the KRG’s financial position.
2015 began with the implementation of  
an agreement between Baghdad and Erbil 
promising an end to uncertainty about the 
KRG’s economic situation, with promises  
of the transfer of a full monthly budget 
allocation to Erbil, and SOMO control of all 
sales of crude from Ceyhan. Unfortunately, 
while exports from KRI fields ramped up,  
the budget transfers stalled, forcing the  
KRG to resume independent export sales.
The KRG has since successfully increased 
exports to record levels, hitting over  
650,000 bopd and reaching a ready market  
of international purchasers. Unfortunately, the 
shortfall of revenue received in the first half  
of the year delayed payments to oil companies, 
a situation compounded by the low oil price 
and the necessity of funding the Peshmerga.
Against this backdrop, the receipt of four 
payments for pipeline exports pertaining  
to the last four months of 2015 was very 
encouraging. These initial payments, totalling 
c.$100 million, helped stabilise our receivable 
and maintain our robust balance sheet. We 
recognise the efforts that the KRG is making  
to meet its commitments to IOCs in a very 
difficult environment. The crystallisation of  
the payment mechanism in February 2016  
was a very positive move, and has provided 
clarity over the quantum and certainty  
over the timing of future payments.
As these payments are forthcoming,  
our investment in the region will continue,  
with the aim of maximising the value of  
our oil fields and facilitating the investment 
required to drive the development of the  
gas business, a business that will help 
further transform the economy of the KRI.
Management changes
At a difficult time for the industry, it is  
vital that a company has a Board with the 
experience and expertise to help navigate 
through choppy waters and to monitor 
carefully the risk across our operations.
2015 saw the retirement of people who  
were integral in the establishment of  
Genel Energy as a respected London-listed 
company. Rodney Chase, my predecessor  
as Chairman, and Julian Metherell, former 
CFO, both made invaluable contributions  
and left Genel with a strong reputation, and 
the financial strength to prosper. Mark Parris 
and Murat Yazici also stepped down in 2015, 
and we wish both well.
In order to retain the knowledge of Genel 
Energy assets, the political and oil industry 
environment, and an in depth understanding 
of operating in the KRI, the Board decided 
that I would replace Rodney as Chairman, 
with Murat Özgül, previously President, 
Turkey and KRI, becoming Chief Executive. 
Murat has overseen the development of our 
Kurdistan business to make Genel Energy 
into one of the largest independent oil 
producers on the London Stock Exchange, 
and there is nobody better qualified to 
progress the development of our world-class 
KRI gas fields.
Finally, the year also saw the retirement of 
our President, Mehmet Sepil. The Kurdistan 
Region of Iraq’s oil industry would not be 
where it is today without the foresight and 
efforts of people like Mehmet. 
Mehmet left a legacy of a company with 
unsurpassed relationships in the region, 
world-class assets, significant production 
and transformational growth opportunities. 
With Murat, and Julian’s successor Ben 
Monaghan, we have the right management 
team, with the relevant and complementary 
skills, to drive the company forward and  
take advantage of these opportunities.
Responsible operations
Supporting and sustaining the communities 
in which we operate is fundamental to Genel 
Energy’s success and our commitment to 
being a sustainable business. We take pride 
in the close relationship that we have with 
the KRG, with whom we have worked closely 
for almost 15 years.
With 1.8 million refugees boosting the 
population of the KRI by over 30%, the KRG, 
working with NGOs, has done an excellent 
job to avoid a catastrophic humanitarian 
incident. We have been glad to provide 
support to the KRG, while not ignoring the 
needs of communities we work in to ensure 
lasting benefit from our operations.
Well positioned in a low-price environment
To ensure the ongoing strength of the 
business even in a period of prolonged low 
oil prices, our focus will remain on retaining 
a strong balance sheet and robust cash 
position. The flexibility of our investment 
programme means that we have a fleet-
footed business that can take advantage  
of an improving external environment. 
With the unique potential offered by the  
gas business, and low-cost oil production 
that promises to be cash generative even  
in very low oil price scenarios, we continue 
to look to the future with confidence.

genelenergy.com CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER’S STATEMENT
Low-cost production,  
appropriate expenditure,  
and focused exploration
Genel is well positioned in the Kurdistan Region of Iraq,  
with a flexibility that provides resilience and the ability  
to capitalise on both existing and future opportunities.
Murat Özgül
Chief Executive Officer
Having been with Genel since 2008, and 
seen the Company grow significantly in  
that time, it is my pleasure to now detail the 
Company’s performance for 2015 as Chief 
Executive Officer. Unfortunately, I do not 
write at a buoyant time for the oil industry.
The decline in the oil price placed a 
significant strain on the entire oil industry  
in 2015, and the price weakness has 
continued into 2016. For the Kurdistan 
Regional Government, despite tremendous 
success in boosting oil exports, the low oil 
price and cessation of budget transfers  
from Baghdad, coupled with the necessity  
of funding the Peshmerga and averting a 
humanitarian crisis through managing the 
influx of refugees into the KRI, has created 
serious financial challenges. 
In this environment three things position 
Genel well for the future – oil production that 
is amongst the lowest cost globally, a robust 
balance sheet, and a tight control on costs. 
Despite the disappointing revision of our 
reserves at Taq Taq, Taq Taq and Tawke 
remain low-cost oil fields by any global 
benchmark. With 264 million barrels of  
net 2P reserves across our KRI portfolio, 
Genel has a robust oil business well 
positioned in the current oil price 
environment, and set to be significantly  
cash generative going forward.
12
Genel Energy plc Annual Report 2015
genelenergy.com Retaining our financial strength
Our strategy remains clear and focused,  
as we look to maximise the potential of our 
KRI oil assets and commercialise our KRI 
gas business, while seeking growth through 
the drill bit and the selective pursuit of 
value accretive M&A opportunities. This 
strategy is underpinned by our business 
model – central to which is the retention  
of a strong balance sheet.
In a challenging external environment it is 
never more important to retain financial 
strength, and ensuring that costs were  
kept to a minimum was a key focus of 
management in 2015. This focus saw a 
number of efficiency measures and cost 
reduction programmes implemented across 
the business, resulting in production costs 
and general and administrative costs falling 
by around 40% compared to 2014. Even 
without receiving full payment for our  
oil exports, cash receipts of $148 million 
local and export sales more than covered 
production costs, general and administrative 
costs, and bond interest during the year.
With the receipt of export payments in the 
fourth quarter of the year stabilising our 
receivable with the KRG and bolstering our 
cash position, we finished 2015 with cash 
balances of $455 million. 2016 cash spend  
at the Company level is forecast to average 
c.$20 million per month, showing our  
ability to withstand even a worst case oil 
price scenario. 
Capital expenditure for 2015 totalled  
$157 million, a reduction of over $500 
million on 2014, as we focused on 
development programmes at Taq Taq  
and Tawke.
Low-cost oil production
The development programmes helped drive 
production at Taq Taq and Tawke to record 
levels, with production up 22% year-on-year 
to 84,900 bopd. The low-cost nature of this 
production helps make Genel Energy a very 
resilient business, with our producing oil 
assets in the Kurdistan Region of Iraq 
benefiting from production costs forecast  
at less than $2/bbl in 2016.
While some of the lowest costs in the industry 
provide Genel with a solid foundation, in order 
to continue investing in the fields it is still vital 
that payments are received for oil produced. 
In August 2015, the Kurdistan Regional 
Government made a public statement that 
reiterated their commitment to make certain 
that oil companies are recompensed for their 
production. Despite the financial crisis facing 
the region, this commitment was matched by 
action, and we have received monthly 
payments for exports since September 2015. 
We have been a partner of the KRG for many 
years, and we recognise the efforts that have 
been made to meet its commitments in 
difficult circumstances.
Regular and predictable payments
This commitment to remunerating IOCs  
was confirmed on 1 February 2016, when  
the Ministry of Natural Resources issued  
a statement announcing that monthly 
payments will be based on the contractual 
entitlements under the production sharing 
contract governing each license. The 
statement also illustrated the mechanism 
through which IOC receivables will be  
paid off, as each month a percentage  
of the monthly netback field revenue 
(starting at 5%) will be used to reduce  
the outstanding amount. As the oil price 
rises, this percentage will increase.
The new payment schedule provides clarity 
over future revenues that was previously 
lacking, allowing us to tailor our field 
development plans and progress them  
with confidence. 
The payment mechanism removes the 
uncertainty of 2015, when the KRG’s  
ability to make sustained and predictable 
payments was hampered by the external 
environment. This uncertainty resulted  
in the prudent decision to reduce  
investment in our producing fields, 
suspending sub-surface investment.
We retain a significant level of flexibility  
over the investment that can be made at  
our producing fields, with the potential to 
insert electric submersible pumps in existing 
wells, sidetrack existing wells, and drill new 
horizontal wells. The extent of this activity 
will reflect the quantum of export payments, 
which are now largely tied to the oil price, as 
well as the technical results of the ongoing 
work programme. Our 2016 capital 
expenditure guidance of $80-120 million 
illustrates this flexibility, and we will aim  
to progress our oil development in a way 
that is broadly cash flow neutral to Genel  
in the near-term.
Production is expected to be 60,000-
70,000 bopd in 2016. The Taq Taq and 
Tawke entitlement achieves breakeven at  
a Brent oil price around $20 a barrel, and 
promises to be significantly cash generative 
as the external environment improves. 
“ The new payment 
schedule provides 
clarity over future 
revenues that was 
previously lacking, 
allowing us to 
tailor our field 
development plans 
and progress them 
with confidence. ”

Taq Taq reserves revision
Given the significant ramp-up in production 
at the Taq Taq field in recent years and 
subsequent decline during 2015, Genel took 
the decision to review its reservoir model 
and its future investment profile for Taq Taq. 
To support this analysis, we commissioned  
an updated Taq Taq competent persons 
report (‘CPR’) from McDaniel & Associates. 
This internal review and the CPR are now 
largely complete. The result is that the initial 
proven and probable reserves in place at the 
field have been revised from the estimated 
683 mmbbls (as of June 2011) to an estimated 
356 mmbbls (as of 31 December 2015).
With Taq Taq having produced a total of  
184 mmbbls up to the end of 2015, the 
remaining gross recoverable 2P reserves  
as of 31 December 2015 are therefore  
172 mmbbls.
The vast majority of the original Taq Taq  
oil in place was reservoired within fractures 
in Cretaceous carbonate formations. The 
Cretaceous has three principal producing 
units – the Qamchuga, Kometan and 
Shiranish – with the Shiranish being the 
shallowest interval. Genel’s internal Taq Taq 
review and the CPR process have focused  
on the fracture porosity within the Shiranish 
reservoir. Both processes have utilised 
recently acquired data to establish that  
the fracture porosity within the Shiranish  
is lower than estimated in the original 
McDaniel CPR from 30 June 2011.
The revision in reserves is of course 
disappointing, but Taq Taq still has 
significant low-cost production to  
come. The field has been crucial in the 
development of the Kurdistan Region  
of Iraq oil industry, and will continue  
to make an important contribution  
in the future.
Commercialising the gas business 
As well as our oil production, the 
development of our Kurdistan Region of  
Iraq gas business also benefits from low 
costs. The onshore location and scale of  
the development means that it delivers an 
industry leading cost structure - with an 
estimated upstream capital and operating 
expenditure of less than $3/boe.
In September 2015, Genel completed the 
acquisition of OMV’s 36% operated stake  
in the Bina Bawi field, consolidating the 
ownership structure across both Miran  
and Bina Bawi, streamlining project 
management and providing flexibility  
in meeting development goals.
The development of the fields is a unique 
opportunity, and promises to deliver 
significant value for shareholders. The fields 
are 300 km from Turkey, one of the world’s 
fastest growing major gas markets with 
expected demand growth of 3% per year 
until 2020 at least. Turkish gas demand 
makes the KRI’s gas reserves of far greater 
strategic importance than oil, and they 
provide Turkey with the opportunity of 
materially reducing their gas import costs.
Turkey currently consumes approximately 
50 bcma of gas, of which more than half  
is provided by Russia. With the KRG set  
to provide 20 bcma, this gas will help to 
diversify, and indeed form the baseload  
of Turkish supply, at a cheaper price than  
all current imports.
The project is underpinned by the KRI-
Turkey Gas Sales Agreement, and the 
development is now progressing on the 
ground in Turkey, with BOTAS having begun 
its tendering process for the construction  
of the Turkish stretch of the pipeline.
It is a world-class development with  
a committed government buyer for  
the gas in place. As such, the progress 
towards converting the PSC amendments 
and gas supply term sheets into fully  
termed documents has been slower than  
we anticipated, as the KRG has been  
focused on oil exports and the difficult 
economic situation. 
At Miran and Bina Bawi, 2016 activity  
will focus on delivering the upstream  
gas development plan and geological/
geophysical studies, and work will also 
commence on the front end engineering 
design and financing plans for the 
midstream gas processing. Capital 
expenditure for the gas project during  
2016 is estimated at c.$25 million.
Portfolio management 
Our portfolio benefits from not having 
expensive commitments, and our focus  
on costs meant that a restructuring of the 
asset portfolio had been undertaken even 
prior to the rebasing of expectations of 
future cash-generation from Taq Taq. 
As part of our ongoing portfolio 
management and rigorous control on costs 
and capital efficiency we are concentrating 
time and investment on our producing and 
development assets, and have reshaped  
our exploration portfolio into a focused  
and low-expenditure, high-impact potential 
asset base.
“ Despite the recent 
reserve revision  
at Taq Taq, the 
Company is well 
positioned in the 
Kurdistan Region 
of Iraq, with a 
flexibility that 
provides resilliece 
to the ongoing 
downturn and the 
ability to capitalise 
on both existing 
and future 
opportunities. ”
14
Genel Energy plc Annual Report 2015
genelenergy.com As part of this process, the Ber Bahr and 
Dohuk licence interests in the KRI are in  
the process of relinquishment, as is the 
interest in the Adigala block in Ethiopia. 
Limited remaining prospectivity in the  
Cap Juby and Mir Left Moroccan assets,  
and a disappointing drilling result offshore 
Côte d’Ivoire, also resulted in the decision  
to exit these licences.
At Chia Surkh (Genel 40% working interest), 
the CS-12 appraisal well is scheduled to be 
drilled in H1 2016. The drilling will help refine 
the contingent resource estimate for the 
Chia Surkh licence. Genel will be carried by 
its partner for the costs of the CS-12 well. 
Genel is therefore looking to the future with 
a portfolio that offers low-cost production,  
a transformational gas business, and highly 
prospective exploration acreage – with 
targeted and flexible spending allowing us  
to focus on those areas in which shareholder 
returns can be maximised. 
Outlook
Genel will continue to focus on costs, 
running operations in the KRI on a broadly 
cash neutral basis. Despite the recent 
reserve revision at Taq Taq, the Company  
is well positioned in the Kurdistan Region  
of Iraq, with a flexibility that provides 
resilience to the ongoing downturn and  
the ability to capitalise on both existing  
and future opportunities.
The quantum of cash receipts will define 
activity levels, and the KRG has provided 
clarity over the regularity of future 
payments, which are set to continue even  
in this challenging environment. Should the 
oil price recover, as we expect it will, the 
level of payments will rise along with our 
entitlement, accelerating the recovery of  
our receivable. The new payment agreement 
will also allow us to progress our field 
development plans and maximise the  
value of our producing assets.
We continue to selectively pursue  
accretive M&A opportunities, although  
any transaction that we execute will be  
the result of careful screening and a robust 
internal process. We will only proceed  
with those that meet our strict criteria 
– complementing the existing KRI position 
without being detrimental to our balance 
sheet strength.
Despite the many market challenges,  
Genel Energy remains a resilient business, 
with opportunities in the portfolio promising 
significant future cash generation.

3. Contingent resources are based on both Genel Energy’s estimates and independent reserve reports
Actual production levels during 2016  
will be subject to the level and phasing  
of investment during the year, which in  
turn will be influenced by the timing and 
quantum of payments for oil exported  
from Taq Taq and Tawke. 
Company production guidance for  
2016, which encompasses both firm  
and contingent activity at both fields, is 
60-70,000 bopd. Based on this production 
guidance and planned activity programmes, 
2016 accrued revenue is estimated at 
$200-275 million on a Brent price of  
$45/bbl. At $35/bbl Brent, 2016 accrued 
revenue is estimated at $160-220 million.
Reserves and resources
At 31 December 2015, Genel Energy’s proven 
plus probable (2P) working interest reserves 
were 264 mmbbls (2014: 429 mmbbls),  
a 39% decrease year-on-year. 
The principal factor in the downward 
revision to the Company’s 2P reserves was  
a significant downgrade at the Taq Taq field. 
Given the significant ramp-up in production 
at Taq Taq in recent years and subsequent 
declines seen during H2 2015, the Company 
announced in January 2016 a review of its 
reservoir model and future investment plans 
for the field. A Competent Person’s Report 
by McDaniel & Associates (‘McDaniel’)  
was also commissioned as a third party 
validation of the internal work. 
In its technical reserves assessment dated 
27 February 2016, McDaniel calculated 
initial gross recoverable 2P reserves 
(referred to in the industry as Estimated 
Ultimate Recovery, or EUR) of 356 mmbbls 
at 31 December 2015. This compares to  
the original McDaniel assessment (as of  
30 June 2011) of 683 mmbbls. Deducting 
gross production from the Taq Taq field  
at 31 December 2015 of 184 mmbbls 
results in gross remaining recoverable  
2P reserves for the field at 31 December 
2015 of 172 mmbbls. This figure compares 
to the 541 mmbbls remaining recoverable 
2P reserves at 31 December 2014. 
The main reason for the downgrade to the 
Taq Taq EUR was a revised assumption of 
the fracture porosity within the Shiranish 
formation, which is one of the three 
Cretaceous aged producing intervals which 
comprise the majority of the EUR in the Taq 
Taq field. This change significantly impacted 
the oil in place estimate for the Shiranish 
reservoir, in turn reducing recoverable 
reserves. In addition, McDaniel also reduced 
the expected contribution from the matrix 
porosity in the Cretaceous Shiranish, 
Kometan, and Qamchuqa reservoirs. 
Tawke gross remaining recoverable 2P 
reserves at 31 December 2015 are estimated 
at 631 mmbbls. This figure is based on  
Tawke gross remaining recoverable 2P 
reserves at 31 December 2014 of 680 
mmbbls (as published by Tawke operator 
DNO ASA) less 2015 gross production  
of 49 mmbbls. DNO ASA is currently 
performing its annual review of the  
Tawke field reserves with the results 
expected to be announced  
in March 2016.
Contingent resources increased by 21% to 
1,252 mmboe (2014: 1,031 mmboe), mainly  
as result of the acquisition of a further 36% 
operated interest in the Bina Bawi field. This 
was only partially offset by minor revisions 
to the contingent resources associated  
with the reduction of Genel’s interest in the 
Chia Surkh licence and the removal of the 
contingent resource associated with the  
Ber Bahr licence, which is in the process  
of relinquishment.
Production
Net working interest production in 2015 
averaged 84,900 bopd, versus the 85-
90,000 bopd guidance range. Production 
guidance for 2015 was originally set at 
90-100,000 bopd, although this was revised 
lower in October 2015 on the back of Taq Taq 
and Tawke production declines, which were 
partly due to a suspension of drilling and 
completion activity during the year. 
Notwithstanding these declines, 2015 
production represented growth of 22% on 
2014. This increase reflected a full year of  
oil exports by the KRG via the export pipeline 
through Turkey. In turn, this allowed both Taq 
Taq and Tawke to operate at or near surface 
processing capacity for most of the year. 
During 2015 production from Taq Taq and 
Tawke was either exported by the KRG or 
sold into domestic markets. The majority 
(75%) of production was exported in 2015, 
reflecting the KRG’s strategy of maximising 
revenues from the region’s oil output. Sales 
to traders in the domestic market totalled 
12% of total volumes sold, with the balance 
of production supplied to the Bazian refinery 
and Tawke topping plant.
Excluding volumes supplied from Taq Taq to 
the Bazian refinery, the Company expects 
that the primary sales route for production 
from Taq Taq and Tawke will continue to be 
exports by the KRG via Ceyhan in Turkey. 
However, if pipeline exports are interrupted, 
production from both fields can be sold into 
the KRI domestic market at short notice,  
for which payments have historically been 
received in advance and directly.
Sub-surface investment at both fields was 
significantly reduced during 2015, reflecting 
the uncertainty over the timing of export 
payments. Payments recommenced in 
September 2015, and development activity 
resumed at the Taq Taq field in Q1 2016.

genelenergy.com Taq Taq (44% working interest,  
joint operator)
The Taq Taq field has been producing  
since 2006 and as a result of a multi-year 
investment programme in both production 
wells and surface facilities delivered 
compound annual growth of 29% between 
2010 and 2015. As of 31 December 2015  
the field had produced 184 mmbbls.  
Gross remaining recoverable 2P reserves  
at 31 December 2015 were estimated at  
172 mmbbls by McDaniel in its technical 
reserves assessment dated 27 February 
2016. The proven plus probable plus  
possible (‘3P’) reserves at 31 December 2015 
were assessed by McDaniel at 416 mmbbls.  
Going forward, the Company’s strategy  
at Taq Taq will be to maximise recovery of 
the 2P reserves through its discretionary 
investment programme, while also exploring 
opportunities to unlock upside potential  
by targeting prospective resources in the 
Cretaceous Qamchuqa reservoir. 
The Taq Taq field produced a gross  
average of 116,000 bopd in 2015, compared 
to 103,000 bopd in 2014, representing  
13% growth year-on-year. Production 
performance was strong in the first half of 
2015, averaging 128,900 bopd on the back of 
high surface capacity utilisation as the KRG 
maximised exports through the KRI-Turkey 
pipeline. During the second half of 2015, 
production declined, averaging 104,000 
bopd and ending the year at 85,000 bopd. 
These declines reflected reservoir 
underperformance and also reflected a 
suspension of sub-surface investment in  
the second half of the year as the Company 
waited for regular export payments to be 
established. During the year 63% of Taq Taq 
output was exported by the KRG through  
the KRI-Turkey pipeline, 27% was sold to  
the Bazian refinery with the remainder  
sold into the KRI domestic market.
In H1 2015, two production wells (TT-23  
and TT-24) were drilled and brought on 
production. At end 2015, a total of 28 wells 
had been drilled across the field, 24 of which 
were in the main Cretaceous reservoir and  
4 in the shallower Tertiary Pilaspi reservoir. 
The 2016 firm activity programme envisages 
side-tracks to existing wells and workover 
operations to arrest production declines. 
Further activity, which is contingent on 
implementation of the 1 February 2016 
monthly export payment mechanism, could 
see a horizontal production well drilled in the 
Cretaceous in addition to further workover 
operations and side-tracks of existing wells. 
During 2015, good progress was made in  
the construction of the second central 
processing facility (‘CPF 2’). CPF 2 is 
designed to process 90,000 bpd of oil and 
has 45,000 bpd of water handling capacity. 
CPF 2 will commence operations in Q2 2016.
 
Tawke (25% working interest)
The Tawke field produced a gross average  
of 135,000 bopd in 2015, compared to 
91,000 bopd in 2014, representing 48% 
growth year-on-year. In H1 2015, wellhead, 
processing and pipeline capacity was 
successfully doubled to 200,000 bopd  
which allowed for a significant ramp-up in 
field production and exports through the 
KRI-Turkey pipeline. Peak production of 
180,000 bopd was achieved in May 2015. 
During the second half of 2015, production 
declined, with the field exiting the year  
at 124,000 bopd. The decline reflects the 
suspension of sub-surface investment during 
H2 2015 as the Tawke partners waited for  
a regular export payment stream to be 
established. During the year 85% of Tawke 
sales were exported by the KRG through the 
KRI-Turkey pipeline, 13% was delivered into 
the KRI domestic market with the remainder 
being sold into the Tawke refinery.
In H1 2015, the final well (Tawke-30) of the 
approved development plan was drilled  
and brought onstream. As of end-2015,  
30 production wells had been drilled at the 
field. The proposed 2016 work programme, 
which is contingent on export payments 
continuing, consists of further production 
wells and construction of water handling 
facilities at the existing central processing 
facility. The Tawke partners will also drill  
the Peshkabir-2 exploratory appraisal well  
in 2016.
KRI pipeline 
infrastructure 
During 2015, the KRG continued to 
upgrade the capacity and integrity  
of the pipeline system through which 
oil is exported from the KRI to the  
port of Ceyhan on the Mediterranean 
coast. The pipeline consists of a 
number of sections. The first, from  
the Taq Taq field to the Khurmala 
Dome, has capacity of 150,000 bopd. 
The second section, from Khurmala  
to the KRI border, has capacity of 
700,000 bopd. At the border, both the 
KRI pipeline and the dedicated export 
pipelines from the Tawke field, which 
have capacity in excess of 250,000 
bopd, are tied into the 40-inch section 
of the Iraq-Turkey pipeline. The 40-inch 
section currently has 700,000 bopd  
of capacity. Pipelines on both the KRI 
and Turkey sides of the border have 
sufficient capacity to facilitate all 
current or future oil exports from 
Genel’s fields.

OPERATING REVIEW - KRI GAS ASSETS
Developing our  
KRI gas business
The development of Miran and Bina Bawi is a unique opportunity, 
underpinned by the KRI-Turkey Gas Sales Agreement, with the  
onshore location and scale of the development delivering an  
industry leading cost structure.
KRI gas: commercial structure 
1. Assumes transfer of the KRG’s interests in Miran and Bina Bawi
20
Genel Energy plc Annual Report 2015
genelenergy.com Miran (75% working interest, operator) 
and Bina Bawi (80% working interest)
During the first half of 2015, Genel  
continued its negotiations with the KRG  
on the commercial framework for the 
development of the Miran and Bina Bawi 
fields. Detailed term sheets for the upstream 
and midstream elements of the KRI gas 
project were signed in early H2 2015, 
replacing the original documentation 
announced in November 2014. The revised 
structure delivers complete alignment along 
the value chain, from the KRI-Turkey Gas 
Sales Agreement through the midstream  
to the upstream, and helps the KRG manage 
its obligations and de-risks the wider project. 
Genel expects to convert these term sheets 
into fully termed documents during Q2 2016.
In September 2015, the Company  
acquired OMV’s 36% operated stake in  
the Bina Bawi field. Genel now has an 80% 
operated working interest in Bina Bawi.  
The consideration comprised an upfront 
payment of $5 million. A contingent 
payment of $70 million is payable once  
gas production exceeds agreed threshold 
volumes from the Miran and Bina Bawi 
fields. A further contingent payment of $75 
million is payable two years after the date of 
the second payment. In consideration of the 
KRG agreeing to the transfer of OMV’s stake 
in the Bina Bawi field, on completion Genel 
offset $25 million against monies owed by 
the KRG to Genel in respect of past expenses 
incurred on the Miran field.
Upstream
The main elements of the upstream gas 
structure are as follows:
• Genel will be sole contractor in both  
Miran and Bina Bawi with a 100% interest 
in both fields
• The responsibilities of Genel will be drilling 
of gas wells, installation of flowlines and 
first stage condensate separation at Miran 
and Bina Bawi. The Company will also be 
responsible for development of the oil 
resources at Miran and Bina Bawi
• Genel’s entitlement share of the raw gas, 
first stage condensate and oil production 
from Miran and Bina Bawi will be dictated 
by the terms of an amended upstream PSC
Gross life of field capex for the upstream  
gas development is estimated at $2.9 billion, 
with $1 billion of this expected to be incurred 
before the onset of gas and first stage 
condensate production. Gross life of  
field capex for the development of the  
oil resources at Miran and Bina Bawi is 
estimated at $400 million, with $60 million 
of this expected to be incurred before first 
oil. This represents a combined oil and gas 
unit life of field development cost of less 
than $2 per barrel of oil equivalent (’boe’). 
Upstream opex remains estimated at  
less than $1/boe. Bids for the upstream 
development plan have been received,  
are being evaluated, and the contract is 
expected to be awarded in April. 
In order to achieve the appropriate balance 
of risk and reward, as well as help fund the 
Miran and Bina Bawi upstream development, 
the Company intends to farm-down part of 
its existing equity interests in both fields.
Midstream
For the midstream gas processing plant,  
a company (’MidstreamCo’) was created 
during 2015 and will be contracted by the 
KRG on a build, own, operate and transfer 
basis for the treatment facilities. Genel is 
working with the KRG on the midstream 
development and is currently leading the 
engineering design process. 
Genel is also leading efforts to secure  
an equity consortium and debt financing. 
During 2015, Genel mandated ING Bank  
as financial advisor on the midstream  
debt financing. Genel has also commenced 
discussions with potential midstream  
equity partners. 
For the midstream, capex for two separate 
facilities, totalling 14 billion cubic metres per 
annum (‘bcma’) of raw gas (10 bcma sales 
gas) processing capacity at Miran and Bina 
Bawi, is estimated at c.$2.5 billion gross.
In December 2015, the Company initiated 
the pre-Front End Engineering Design 
(FEED) and technical consultancy study 
package tender for both the Miran and Bina 
Bawi gas treatment and processing facilities. 
Genel expects to award the pre-FEED 
contact in April 2016. The pre-FEED is 
expected to complete by end H1 2016 and 
will focus on site selection and technical 
design for the gas processing facilities at 
Miran and Bina Bawi. It will also result in  
a basic procurement matrix which will 
facilitate initial discussions with export  
credit agencies as part of the project 
financing solution. 
Assuming satisfactory completion of the 
pre-FEED studies, the project will then 
progress to a full FEED study in H2 2016. 
Expression of Interest letters have been  
sent to eligible engineering, procurement 
and construction (EPC) contractors, with  
the $2.5 billion midstream cost and 30-36 
month construction window verified by  
EPC contractor responses. The Company 
also intends to award the contract for the 
Environmental & Social Impact Assessment 
in Q2 2016.
Award of the EPC tender and final 
investment decision on the KRI gas project 
would follow successful delivery of the steps 
outlined above.
Development of the Miran and Bina Bawi  
oil resources is scheduled to commence  
in H1 2017, although sanctioning of  
this development activity is subject  
to continued export payments for oil 
production, prevailing oil prices and  
the success of any farm-down process.
During 2015, the Summail field on the Dohuk 
licence (Genel 40% working interest) ceased 
production following significant declines  
on the back of reservoir underperformance. 
The Summail facilities were subsequently 
decommissioned and the Company is in the 
process of relinquishing its interest in the 
Dohuk licence.

genelenergy.com OPERATING REVIEW - EXPLORATION AND APPRAISAL
Creating value  
with the drill bit
Genel continues to prioritise near-term spend on our KRI production  
and development assets, while our refocused exploration strategy will  
target lower cost onshore opportunities. In 2016, the focus will be on  
the upside potential in the existing KRI portfolio, where the Company  
will participate in two exploration wells on Chia Surkh and Peshkabir.
2015 EXPLORATION REVIEW 
A combination of the unsuccessful 2014 
exploration programme and falling oil prices 
led to a decision in early 2015 to prioritise 
investment on the Company’s producing and 
development assets. As a result, there was a 
significant reduction in exploration activity 
during the year, with only one well drilled 
across the portfolio. 
Exploration for new accumulations of oil and 
gas remains a key element of Genel’s 
strategy, as it has the potential to deliver 
resource to underpin future growth. In 2016, 
the focus will be on the upside potential in the 
existing KRI portfolio, where the Company 
will participate in exploratory appraisal wells 
on the Chia Surkh and Peshkabir structures. 
The Company will also continue to screen 
opportunities to acquire prospective acreage 
in its core areas, albeit with a focus on 
minimising upfront capital commitments.
KRI
In October 2015, Genel disposed of a  
20% interest in the Chia Surkh Production 
Sharing Contract to its partner Petoil, 
thereby reducing its interest to 40%.  
As consideration for the sale of the 20% 
interest, Petoil will carry Genel’s share of  
the costs associated with the Chia Surkh-12 
(‘CS-12’) appraisal well. The total cost of the 
CS-12 well is estimated at c.$50 million, with 
drilling expected to commence in April 2016. 
The drilling will help refine the contingent 
resource estimate for the Chia Surkh licence, 
which is now estimated at 225 million barrels 
of oil equivalent.
Under the terms of the disposal, Petoil has 
transferred $10 million to Genel in the form 
of security which will be released at different 
stages of well operations in accordance with 
cash calls, well completion and testing. The 
operatorship of the Chia Surkh PSC will also 
transfer from Genel to Petoil for the duration 
of the CS-12 well.

efforts to provide the appropriate level of security in order to 
conduct future operations.
On the Tawke licence, the Peshkabir-2 
exploratory appraisal well is scheduled for 
H2 2016. The operator estimates 32 mmbbls 
and 225 mmbbls of 2P reserves and 
prospective resources respectively for  
the Peshkabir structure.
The Company’s 40% working interest in  
the Ber Bahr licence is in the process of

In December 2015, Genel announced that 
the Aigle-1X exploration well on the CI-508 
licence offshore Côte d’Ivoire (Genel 24% 
working interest) had been plugged and 
abandoned after failing to encounter 
hydrocarbons. The completion of this well 
concluded Genel’s committed Côte d’Ivoire 
drilling programme. 
On the Sidi Moussa licence (Genel 60% 
working interest) offshore Morocco, work 
has continued to incorporate the results of 
the SM-1 well drilled in Q4 2014. A farm-out 
process has commenced as part of the 
Company’s ongoing portfolio management 
activities, with encouraging levels of 
interest. Genel will consider its options 
regarding future activity on the Sidi Moussa 
licence once the farm-out process is 
concluded. The Company has agreed with 
the Moroccan authorities that commitments 
associated with the Mir Left licence be 
transferred to Sidi Moussa, with Genel 
subsequently withdrawing from Mir Left.  
The Company is also withdrawing from the 
Juby Maritime licence.
Onshore Somaliland the acquisition of  
2D seismic data on the Odewayne (Genel 
50%, operator) and SL -10B/13 (Genel 75%,

results of a surface seep study completed 
early in 2015 confirmed the outstanding 
potential offered by this huge acreage 
position (41,000 km

). Genel continues to 
support the government’s efforts to provide 
the appropriate level of security in order to 
conduct future operations. Genel continues 
to seek a strategic partner for its Somaliland

balancing risk and reward and reducing 
upfront capital commitments.
After a review of licence potential, Genel  
has decided to exit its 44% working interest 
in the Adigala block onshore Ethiopia.

Results for the period
For the year ended 31 December 2105, the 
Company reported revenue of $343.9 
million (2014: $519.7 million), a loss before 
tax of $1,160.6 million (2014: $312.8 million 
loss) and a loss per share of 417.30 cents 
(2014: 112.97 cents loss). Free cash flow for 
the period was an outflow of $179.2 million 
(2014: outflow of $560.9 million). 
Revenue
Revenue of $343.9 million (2014: $519.7 
million) and EBITDAX of $279.4 million 
(2014: $410.6 million) decreased from the 
comparable period as a result of lower oil 
price despite higher production volumes. 
Operating costs
Cost of sales of $208.3 million (2014: $203.1 
million) is comprised of production costs of 
$36.3 million, reduced from $62.1 million  
in 2014 and depreciation charges of $172.0 
million (2014: $141.0 million) which increased 
broadly in line with production levels. 
Impairment of property, plant and equipment 
included $1,038.0 million relating to Taq Taq 
(2014: $80.9 million relating to Dohuk).
Exploration costs written-off of $173.0 
million (2014: $476.8 million) represent the 
write-off of expenditure principally relating 
to exploration activity in KRI, Morocco,  
Côte d’Ivoire and Ethiopia.
General and administrative costs amounted 
to $28.7 million (2014: $47.0 million) for  
the period.
Finance expense
Finance expense of $56.5 million (2014: 
$24.7 million) represents interest on the 
$730 million bonds, together with $7.7 million 
of discount unwind (2014: $1.8 million).
Taxation
In the KRI, all corporation tax due has been 
paid on behalf of the Company by the KRG 
from the KRG’s own share of revenues and 
there is no tax payment required or expected 
to be made. Tax presented in the income 
statement relates to taxation of the Turkish 
and UK service companies.
Dividend
No dividend (2014: nil) will be paid for the 
year ended 31 December 2015. 
Capital expenditure
Capital expenditure in the year amounted  
to $157.2 million (2014: $676.9 million). 
Development spend of $109.2 million  
(2014: $193.4 million) was incurred on  
the producing assets in KRI with spend  
on exploration assets amounting to  
$48.0 million (2014: $480.8 million).
Cash flow
Net cash flow from operations was $71.2 
million (2014: $134.8 million), which was 
impacted by an increase of $189.0 million  
in amounts due from the KRG. This together 
with capital expenditure of $250.4 million 
(2014: $676.9 million), which included 
significant working capital movements  
of net $93.2m relating principally to the 
payment of brought forward accruals 
relating to 2014 activity, resulted in a free 
cash outflow of $179.2 million (2014: $560.9 
million). Net cash spend on acquisitions was 
$3.9 million (2014: $76.8 million). Financing 
raised from the issue of bonds raised a net 
$196.2 million with interest costs on the 
bond of $46.1 million and foreign exchange 
loss of $0.8 million on cash. Overall there 
was a net cash outflow of $33 million  
(2014: $210.6 million outflow) in the year.
Cash
At 31 December 2015, the Comany had  
a cash balance of $455.3 million (2014: 
$489.1 million) and net debt of $238.8 
million (2014: $2.3 million). 
Acquisitions
The Company spent $5.0 million (2014: 
$76.8 million) on the acquisition of the 
additional 36% operated stake in the Bina 
Bawi field, thereby increasing the Company’s 
interest to 80%. The consideration is 
comprised of: an upfront payment of net 
$3.9 million; a contingent payment of  
$70m payable once gas production exceeds 
certain threshold volumes from the Miran 
and Bina Bawi fields; and a second payment 
of $75m payable two years after the date of 
the contingent payment.
Net assets
Net assets at 31 December 2015 were 
$2,574.8 million (2014: $3,733.5 million)  
and consist primarily of oil and gas assets  
of $926.8 million (2014: $2,010.7 million), 
exploration and evaluation assets of $1,671.0 
million (2014: $1,676.6 million) and net debt  
of $238.8 million (2014: $2.3 million net debt).
Liquidity/counterparty risk management
The Company monitors its cash position, 
cash forecasts and liquidity on a regular 
basis. The Company takes a conservative 
approach to cash management, with surplus 
cash held in government gilts or treasury 
bills or on time deposits with a number of 
major financial institutions. Suitability of 
banks is assessed using a combination of 
sovereign risk, credit default swap pricing 
and credit rating. 
Going concern
The directors have assessed that the  
cash balance held provides the Company  
with adequate headroom over forecast 
operational and potential acquisition 
expenditure for the 12 months following  
the signing of the annual report for the 
period ended 31 December 2015 for the 
Group to be considered a going concern.
Accounting policies
UK listed companies are required to comply 
with the European regulation to report 
consolidated statements that conform to 
International Financial Reporting Standards 
(IFRS) as adopted by the European Union. 
Principal accounting policies adopted by the 
Group and applicable for the period ended  
31 December 2015 can be found in the 2015

Supporting the Kurdistan Region of Iraq 
The Kurdistan Region of Iraq continued  
to face significant challenges in 2015.  
The ongoing fight against ISIS remains  
a financial drain on the Kurdistan Region  
of Iraq at a time when the sustained low  
oil price is already placing a major burden  
on the economy.
As well as the direct cost of funding the 
Peshmerga, the conflict in Iraq and Syria has 
forced a multitude of people away from their 
homes and into the sanctuary of the KRI. 
Having worked with the KRG for well over a 
decade, we at Genel Energy are keen to help 
support the region at this difficult time. 
The focus of our efforts in 2015 centred on  
the Syrian refugees and internally displaced 
persons (IDPs) seeking refuge in the KRI. To 
put the crisis into perspective, the influx of 
people has caused a 30% increase in the total 
population of the Kurdistan Region of Iraq. 
The provision of emergency support has 
helped to tackle pressing short-term needs, 
but we remain committed to our operations 
making a tangible long-term difference to 
those communities in which we operate.  
This remains a key focus of the business,  
and our ongoing work in this area central to 
what we see as the success of Genel Energy.

HEALTH AND SAFETY
We firmly believe that a safe workplace  
is fundamental to protect our people and 
our business. Our primary consideration  
is always the safety and wellbeing of our 
employees, something that we never 
compromise. Everyone at Genel has to follow 
our HSE management system requirements, 
which we appraise and review regularly. 
Genel’s HSE management system defines 
our approach to managing health, safety 
and environment matters across all of  
its facilities and activities. The system 
provides compliance requirements as  
well as practical guidance and procedures 
for all staff conducting operations or 
managing sites to achieve our health,  
safety and environmental objectives  
as an integrated part of our overall goals.
Highlights
During 2015 Genel’s HSE performance 
continued to improve. In particular, we:
• Reduced the number of lost time incidents 
to zero, compared to one in 2014
• Further developed and updated our  
HSE strategy and plans
• Improved TTOPCO’s HSE and process 
safety performance
• Continued to roll out procedures and  
tools for enhanced HSE management
• Continued to report our greenhouse  
gas emissions
Leadership
In 2015 we continued to enhance operational 
leadership by conducting a number of 
learning sessions to further embed HSE 
management systems and processes to 
assure a focused and integrated approach  
to risk management.
Process safety
We commissioned gas dispersion and 
consequence modelling studies in order 
ensure that process safety was included  
in the early stages of a project life cycle.  
This was done to ensure that the risks are 
understood and necessary risk reduction 
measures implemented in a timely fashion. 
Working with contractors
Working safely with contractors continues  
to be a priority for Genel. We continue to 
focus on rigorous and consistent on-site 
implementation of our HSE policies  
and procedures. During 2015 further 
improvements were made to our on-site 
leadership and supervision thereby ensuring 
more effective management of contractors. 
Measuring our performance
Lost time incident frequency (LTIF) measures 
the number of lost time incidents per million 
work hours and is the headline indicator of 
the success of our safety programmes. In 
2015 we achieved zero LTIF versus a 2014 
performance of 0.40. The combined Genel/
TTOPCO 2015 LTIF was 0.65 versus a 2014 
performance of 1.01. These improvements 
reflect the progress achieved in our safety 
culture and performance.
We are committed  
to conducting all  
of our operations  
in a manner that protects 
Genel’s employees and 
contractors from injuries 
and illnesses, as well as 
having regard to the

Genel Energy plc Annual Report 2015
genelenergy.com PEOPLE
Our talented, experienced and motivated 
staff are key to the success of our Company, 
and we are committed to developing our 
employees, promoting diversity, fairness  
and respect in the workplace and  
providing recognition based on success  
and achievement.
Highlights
At 31 December 2015, Genel employed  
145 people. Of these 145 employees, 74  
are based in Ankara, 25 in London, 20 in  
the Kurdistan Region of Iraq and 26 in our 
African operations. TTOPCO employed  
533 people at the end of 2015. 
Unfortunately, during the year we have had 
to re-align the business to reflect the current 
operating environment. Steps have been 
taken to reduce general and administrative 
costs, and the business has re-focused on 
our producing assets, in turn scaling back 
our African exploration programme to 
target low-cost, onshore opportunities.  
This has resulted in a large reduction in  
our workforce across all regions which,  
while a difficult decision, was the right  
one to take for the future of the business.
Training and skills
Continually investing in the technical and 
professional development of our people 
gives them the tools they need to drive  
our business forward, operate safely  
and efficiently and help Genel achieve  
our strategic and operational goals. 
Providing staff development opportunities  
is a priority, and we use an external  
provider to give employees access  
to a wide range of professional skills  
training, including geoscience, technical  
and engineering courses.
Conduct
Adherence to the highest standards of 
corporate governance is a key pillar of  
our strategy, and our commitment to  
acting responsibly, ethically and in a  
safe manner across our entire business  
is embraced by all of our operations.  
During 2015 our employees undertook 
face-to-face training on our Code of 
Conduct. We are proud of our staff and the 
way that our extremely high standards gain 
the respect and trust of the governments  
and communities that host our operations, 
underpinning the sustainability of our  
current and future business.
Pay and benefits
A transparent and competitive reward 
framework allows us to attract and retain a 
highly skilled employee base. Performance-
related-pay is available to all our staff, in line 
with a well-structured and clearly defined 
performance management process.
In 2015, the refugee crisis was putting a 
significant economic burden on the KRG, 
and this formed the focus of our 
community efforts.
Liaising with local authorities and NGOs, 
Genel Energy provided emergency aid to 
IDPs finding shelter in Erbil, Suleimaniah 
and Duhok governorates, as we focused 
on those areas in close proximity to our 
operations and those located in places 
less frequently visited by NGOs.
In the Suleimaniah governorate, Genel 
purchased and delivered essential items, 
including beds, blankets, milk, and  
fans, to local IDP sites and aid centres, 
targeting the needs of children,  
women and the elderly. 
Our key contribution in the year was  
the opening of a refugee camp near  
Koya in February. The camp, funded 
through a donation from TTPOCO, 
shelters over fifty families, providing 
them with permanent housing,  
electricity, and sanitation.
In the Koya and Taq Taq districts food 
packs, women’s items and children’s toys 
were distributed to 668 IDP families. Out 
of the 3,350 IDPs in those two districts, 
259 were children under the age of 5.
In the Erbil governorate, Genel Energy 
conducted a significant aid campaign, 
helping displaced families sheltering in 
school buildings, churches and the camp 
located within Erbil’s Ainkawa quarter. Aid 
was distributed to families belonging to 
religious minorities, including Christians, 
Yezidis, Shabaks and Kakayees. A total  
of 200 families were given food packs, 
bedding items, children’s shoes and  
baby necessities.
Our work with NGOs continued in 2015. 
With Save the Children, we helped to fund 
the provision of child resilience support 
and purchase life-saving hygiene and 
household equipment in three refugee 
camps, while our partnership with the 
International Rescue Committee saw 435 
refugee households supported with the 
provision of essential supplies, with direct 
financial support then given to a further 
2000 families, which in turn boosts the 
local economy.
This partnership, which followed a 
fundraising initiative in which Genel 
Energy matched all donations made by 
employees and friends, helps reduce the 
burden on the local community and 
supports the integration of IDP families.

in 2014. The main reasons for this significant 
decrease were the completion and 
abandonment of exploration wells in  
Africa and the exploration well at Miran  
in Kurdistan Region of Iraq.
Environmental impact assessments
During 2015 we commissioned 
environmental impact assessment studies 
during the planning phase related to 
significant activities or the management of 
projects, such as the drilling testing of wells 
and the design of early production facilities. 
The EIA process is applied prior to major 
decisions and commitments being made  
and is designed to identify, predict and 
evaluate the environmental effects of 
proposed actions and projects, including  
the identification of measures to reduce  
or avoid these effects where possible. 
This systematic process helps to ensure 
compliance with applicable legislation and  
is an effective way to maintain alignment 
with industry best practice.
COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT
We partner with and invest in communities 
close to our operations to achieve mutual 
long-term benefits, with a focus on four  
key areas.
Sustainable Economic Development
Our infrastructure development, capacity 
building payments and employee and 
contractor wages have a direct and material 
impact on development in the countries 
where we operate.
Our most significant contribution to 
economic growth so far has been in the KRI, 
where we continue to play a key part in the 
development of the oil and gas sector and 
remain the biggest oil producer and largest 
holder of reserves and resources.
It is essential for us to uphold our 
commitment to hiring local people in the 
countries where we operate and continue  
to be a responsible and attractive employer. 
To do this, we participate in salary and 
benefits benchmarking surveys within  
the various regions to ensure we remain 
externally competitive and effectively  
retain and reward all of our employees.
Diversity
Our commitment to employing a diverse and 
balanced workforce enables us to build an 
effective and talented workforce at all levels 
of the organisation, including the Board.  
The value we place on equal opportunities 
and diversity of ideas, skills, knowledge, 
experience, culture, ethnicity and gender  
is evident in our daily operations as well as 
formalised in our policies and procedures.
Our recruitment policy is to appoint 
individuals based solely on their skills, 
experience and suitability to the role.  
32% (46 employees) of our workforce  
are women. Of those, 9% (four employees) 
hold senior management positions within 
our organisation.
ENVIRONMENT
Our operations are managed in accordance 
with our policy of minimising environmental 
impacts and potential adverse effects. This 
includes a focus on effective design, efficient 
operation, and responsible energy use.
Greenhouse gas emissions
We are reporting our 2015 greenhouse gas 
(GHG) emissions in accordance with the 
requirements of the UK’s Companies Act 
2006 (Strategic Report and Directors’ 
Reports) Regulations 2013. The regulations 
require companies to report on their GHG 
emissions from activities for which they are 
responsible. To determine responsibility for 
our activities we applied the ‘operational 
control approach’ to setting organisational 
boundaries as defined by the WRI/WBCSD 
GHG Protocol Corporate Accounting and 
Reporting Standard (the GHG Protocol).  
The reported data has been sourced from 
operations where we have identified Genel 
as having operational control of the facility 
or asset during 2015.
The regulations require the reporting of 
emissions associated with: 1) the combustion 
of fuel, e.g. in stationary equipment and 
vehicles; and 2) the operation of facilities, 
e.g. through the purchase of electricity, 
execution of physical or chemical processes, 
and unintentional releases through leaks. 
These two categories are closely aligned 
with the scope 1 and scope 2 emissions 
categories as defined by the GHG Protocol. 
The majority of energy and fuel data 
collected has been based on actual, 
measured consumption. 0.26% of emissions 
(4 tonnes of CO
2
 equivalent (tCO
2
e))  
Lasting economic benefit
Our business operations in the KRI create  
an economic benefit not only for Genel but 
also for the wider region, its people and 
government. Oil production from our fields 
is of vital importance to the KRI, helping to 
provide the region with the funds to fuel its 
economy. As the gas from Miran and Bina 
Bawi begins flowing to Turkey, there is the 
clear potential for transformational 
economic growth.
At Genel we do not wish the benefit to the 
KRG to be purely the result of direct revenues 
from oil and gas, and strive to ensure that our 
operations have a long-term benefit to the 
community. Genel and TTOPCO employed 
over 550 people in the KRI, 75% of whom  
are from the local area, with many others 
employed by contractors who work for us.  
We also continue to utilise local companies 
and suppliers wherever possible.
In 2015, the refugee crisis was putting a 
significant economic burden on the KRG, 
and this formed the focus of our  
community efforts. 
Meaningful Community Relations
The development of positive and enduring 
relationships with the people and communities 
in which we operate is crucial to our success.
Our work in the community is based on 
working in partnership to identify and  
meet community needs. Proactive and 
constructive engagement with people  
living and working near our operations  
is maintained in order to develop an 
understanding of, and create a spirit of 
collaboration with, our work and the way  
it is developing their area and region. 
Aligning with local development goals
The people best placed to identify local 
community needs are local community 
members. Ongoing communication helps us 
to identify appropriate projects to support 
them and their development goals. With this 
in mind 2015 saw the development of Five 
Year Plans for communities surrounding  
the Miran and Taq Taq fields. 
The process was done through an open 
dialogue with local people, authorities  
and the KRG, listening to feedback and 
connecting with our operational teams to 
find ways to improve our interaction with 
communities and plan for the future.
Approximately 20 villages were visited, 
demographic data collected, and requests 
prioritised. Following discussion with the 
Ministry of Natural Resources the ‘Miran Five 
Year Plan’ and ‘Taq Taq Five Year Plan’ were 
successfully completed. Genel Energy has 
developed a clear picture and overview, which 
will help determine service projects that can 
be implemented over the next five years.

Genel Energy plc Annual Report 2015
genelenergy.com For further details about  
our CSR activities, including an 
educational poster developed  
for the KRI, please visit the  
Genel Energy website.
In 2016 the focus at Taq Taq will be on the 
construction of facilities to provide clean 
water to five local villages. At Miran, the 
focus is set to be on the provision of various 
training courses such as literacy, sewing, 
learning first aid and awareness-raising 
regarding health issues. A six classroom 
building is also set to be constructed. 
Garbage collection projects at local  
villages will continue around both fields.
Significant projects in 2015 carried out in  
the Taq Taq region included the maintenance 
of the Darbasar village road and electricity 
supply to Elenjakh, while rubbish collection 
was ongoing. 
At the Miran site, as well as a rubbish 
collection programme for local villages,  
over 3000 plants were planted to help  
enrich the environment surrounding the site.
Land acquisition
Genel continues to strictly adhere to the 
government process and fully support  
local landowners in receiving land and crop 
compensation payments. A roadmap for 
land acquisition and crop compensation  
has been designed by our CSR team based 
on MNR guidelines. In 2015, Genel’s CSR 
team in coordination with the administration 
department, helped landowners to receive 
appropriate land and crop compensation  
in a timely manner.
Improved Community Health
We support local health services and 
contribute to emergency refugee aid projects 
to help both local and regional communities.
Some of our operations are in regions that, 
due to their remoteness and development 
challenges, can lack consistent access to 
medical services and infrastructure. We 
have undertaken a number of projects that 
directly contribute to the development of 
the Kurdistan Region of Iraq’s health sector 
and have a direct positive impact on both 
local and regional communities.
The provision of clean drinking water is  
a key consideration in areas around our 
more remote sites. Three villages in close 
proximity to the Chia Surkh operations  
- Kani Pamu, Parwezkhan and Sarqizil -  
were provided with drinking water in 2015.
As well as ongoing projects to improve  
living conditions in local communities,  
Genel has also been providing support  
to the Hiwa Cancer Centre, located in 
Suleimaniah. The Centre is the region’s 
leading cancer specialist, and the hospital 
provides treatment to sufferers across the 
entire KRI, and Iraq as a whole. A total of  
$120,000 was provided to the Centre  
in 2015.
In the villages near the Taq Taq field, our 
medical team has continued regular visits, 
twice a month, and medical services have 
been provided to more than 10 villages 
throughout the year. The medical team  
also started to visit the newly built camp  
for refugees at Koya and launched the 
provision of immediate medical support  
to the families on a weekly basis.
Local and regional capacity building
We are helping to unlock the potential  
of our host countries’ natural resources, 
developing infrastructure and supporting 
economic growth. We also have a 
responsibility to help the people who  
live near our sites develop the skills to  
thrive and play a central part in this  
exciting process.
Employing locally
The greatest demand we have from local, 
and the most direct way we can improve the 
lives of local people, is for jobs. By employing 
and buying locally whenever possible, and 
requiring that our contractors do the same, 
we can make an immediate difference to 
local families. 
Our commitment to this was formalised  
in our policies and procedures in 2014, 
including a specific local content procedure 
for the KRI. 
Education as a priority
A focus on education remains one of  
our priorities, and we strive to help  
each and every child be given a proper  
education through creating more  
effective learning environments and 
emphasising the significance of education  
in local communities.
We continue to run educational and training 
programmes, teaching vocational skills  
that are mutually beneficial for the area  
and our company, as it helps grow a local, 
skilled workforce. 
A comprehensive graduate recruitment  
plan has also been developed and approved 
by Genel, and will be executed as operations 
commence in the Chia Surkh region. 
Donations of equipment and materials  
to the schools in the Miran area helped  
to raise the educational environment. 
It is also of vital importance to the lives  
of children in the refugee camps that their 
educational needs are met. Students at  
the Arbat Camp were provided with office 
equipment, desks, chairs, whiteboards and 
other necessary schooling items to allow 
them to continue with their education even 
in trying circumstances.

RISK DESCRIPTION AND IMPACT MITIGATION AND MANAGEMENT ASSESSMENT CHANGE
Audit Committee
Development 
and recovery  
of reserves  
and resources
Estimates of commercial reserves and contingent resources can change with time. Adjustments to estimates can arise from  
a number of circumstances, including but not limited to:
 - the inherent uncertainty in any oil and gas asset, which can impact well and reservoir performance  
and recoverable volumes;
 - sub-optimal development and use of an asset either as a result of subsurface or reservoir uncertainty  
or plans made with inadequate data; and
 - poor reservoir performance and realisation of value as a result of failure to consider the most suitable  
development option for an asset.
A change in estimates may impact field production volumes, capital expenditure, operating costs and the life of field,  
all of which contribute to the valuation of the relevant asset.
The Company’s generation of returns depends on its ability to exploit, develop and commercialise present assets successfully,  
as well as to select and acquire suitable assets for exploitation, development and commercialisation in the future.
The performance of its producing assets and commercialisation of its exploration and appraisal assets are fundamental to the 
business going forward. If the Company is unable to develop its reserves and resources there may be material and adverse 
effects on its business, financial condition, the results of operations and its prospects.
The Company has an established subsurface team responsible  
for defining workflows and modelling reservoirs and processes  
to optimise the development and use of the Company’s assets.
Allocation of spend for development of assets is assessed by  
the Executive Director and the Board.
For much of 2015, the Company was unable to invest in its 
producing assets because it was not being paid for the export 
sales made from those assets. At the same time the production 
at T aq T aq assets was below expectation.
Following the decline in production at T aq T aq, management 
commenced an internal study and commissioned a Competent 
Persons Report from McDaniel.
The result of the internal study was a reduction in assessed 
gross recoverable proven and probable reserves estimates from 
683 mmbls (as of June 2011) to 356 mmbbls (as of December 
2015), of which 172 mmbbls remains - this has been confirmed  
by the competent person. Further explanation is provided on 
page 14.
At T awke, the annual reserves review by the Operator in March 
2015 confirmed the gross recoverable proven and probable 
reserves estimates at 603 mmbls at 31 December 2014. The 
results of the Operator’s review for the year ended 31 December 
2015 are expected in March 2016.
The Completion of the Operator’s review at T awke, together  
with the Company’s own detailed analysis of T aq T aq, will provide 
management with an improved understanding of its assets.  
his understanding will be enhanced by further work planned  
for 2016, and should assist in assessing the most appropriate 
development plans for achieving the maximum realisation of 
value from both assets.
The major gas assets at Miran and Bina Bawi require significant 
spend in order to deliver value to the Company and its 
shareholders. 
Further explanation is provided in the Operating Review on 
pages 16 to 23.

Board
Major capital 
projects
The Company is reliant on the completion of major projects to achieve its planned growth. 
It is necessary to ensure that there is appropriate oversight of projects, whether outsourced to third parties or managed 
internally, to minimise the risk of projects being delayed or completed above their budgeted cost. If projects are not executed  
on time and to budget, the planned growth and profitability of the Company will be negatively impacted. 
Senior management is involved in the approval, initiation, 
planning, monitoring, testing and completion of major projects and 
the oversight of the performance of contractors, with a specific 
owner being accountable for each project of significance.
Project plans, updates, possible risks and outcomes of reviews  
are reported to the Board and appropriate actions are agreed.
The development of the Miran and Bina Bawi gas assets is  
a major focus for the business over the next few years and  
is a significant component of its planned growth.
Further explanation is provided in the Chief Executive’s 
statement on page 12 and the Operating review on pages  
20 and 21.
 Increased
M&A activity  
In accordance with Company strategy, management review selective M&A opportunities in the pursuit of value  
accretive transactions.
Execution of a transaction could adversely impact the Company’s liquidity, balance sheet, valuation, asset quality,  
and equity story, among other factors. 
An experienced Board oversees and signs off on all M&A decisions.
The Company has an established process to ensure that an 
appropriate level of due diligence (including sub-surface, 
engineering, financial, legal, tax and anti-bribery and corruption)  
is performed in order to appropriately assess each transaction 
that is considered.
The pursuit of selective, value accretive M&A opportunities  
is part of our Strategy, outlined on page 2.
 Unchanged
KRI natural 
resources 
industry
The Company is dependent on its strong relationship with the KRG in order to realise the value of its principal oil and gas assets: 
T aq T aq, T awke, Miran and Bina Bawi.
The relationship with the KRG is significant in a number of areas, including but not limited to: availability of and access  
to infrastructure and services in the KRI (including export pipelines, utilities, oilfield police force and third-party services); 
compliance and observance of the terms of the PSC agreements, including mechanism for calculation of entitlement and 
payment of monies owed; future development plans and operation of licences; and engagement with local communities.
Deterioration in the relationship with the KRG or a change in policy by the KRG may result in a significant loss of value for the 
Company either through perceived risk of operating in the region or through reduced ability to realise the value of the assets.
Internal disputes amongst the parties that form the Kurdistan Regional Government, and pressure being placed on the Ministry 
of Natural Resources, may lead to a change in the composition of the government or the removal of ministers that may have  
a detrimental effect on Genel’s relationships.
The Company has been operating in the region since 2002 and 
hence has a long history of working effectively with the KRG and 
contributing to the development of its natural resources industry. 
The Company maintains regular dialogue with the KRG and  
seeks to work collaboratively with the KRG, local communities, 
local suppliers and subcontractors to achieve mutually  
benefical objectives.
The KRI natural resources industry has made significant 
operational progress in 2015 in both establishing an independent 
oil export route and increasing production volumes.
For the Company, 2015 has seen progress made towards  
both the normalisation of payments for export sales and the 
development of the Company gas assets. The development  
of the Company’s gas assets is an important part of the KRG’s 
contractual commitment to deliver gas to Turkey.

The Completion of the Operator’s review at T awke, together  
with the Company’s own detailed analysis of T aq T aq, will provide 
management with an improved understanding of its assets.  
his understanding will be enhanced by further work planned  
for 2016, and should assist in assessing the most appropriate 
development plans for achieving the maximum realisation of 
value from both assets.
The major gas assets at Miran and Bina Bawi require significant 
spend in order to deliver value to the Company and its 
shareholders. 
Further explanation is provided in the Operating Review on

Board
Major capital 
projects
The Company is reliant on the completion of major projects to achieve its planned growth. 
It is necessary to ensure that there is appropriate oversight of projects, whether outsourced to third parties or managed 
internally, to minimise the risk of projects being delayed or completed above their budgeted cost. If projects are not executed  
on time and to budget, the planned growth and profitability of the Company will be negatively impacted. 
Senior management is involved in the approval, initiation, 
planning, monitoring, testing and completion of major projects and 
the oversight of the performance of contractors, with a specific 
owner being accountable for each project of significance.
Project plans, updates, possible risks and outcomes of reviews  
are reported to the Board and appropriate actions are agreed.
The development of the Miran and Bina Bawi gas assets is  
a major focus for the business over the next few years and  
is a significant component of its planned growth.
Further explanation is provided in the Chief Executive’s 
statement on page 12 and the Operating review on pages  
20 and 21.
 Increased
M&A activity  
In accordance with Company strategy, management review selective M&A opportunities in the pursuit of value  
accretive transactions.
Execution of a transaction could adversely impact the Company’s liquidity, balance sheet, valuation, asset quality,  
and equity story, among other factors. 
An experienced Board oversees and signs off on all M&A decisions.
The Company has an established process to ensure that an 
appropriate level of due diligence (including sub-surface, 
engineering, financial, legal, tax and anti-bribery and corruption)  
is performed in order to appropriately assess each transaction 
that is considered.
The pursuit of selective, value accretive M&A opportunities  
is part of our Strategy, outlined on page 2.
 Unchanged
KRI natural 
resources 
industry
The Company is dependent on its strong relationship with the KRG in order to realise the value of its principal oil and gas assets: 
T aq T aq, T awke, Miran and Bina Bawi.
The relationship with the KRG is significant in a number of areas, including but not limited to: availability of and access  
to infrastructure and services in the KRI (including export pipelines, utilities, oilfield police force and third-party services); 
compliance and observance of the terms of the PSC agreements, including mechanism for calculation of entitlement and 
payment of monies owed; future development plans and operation of licences; and engagement with local communities.
Deterioration in the relationship with the KRG or a change in policy by the KRG may result in a significant loss of value for the 
Company either through perceived risk of operating in the region or through reduced ability to realise the value of the assets.
Internal disputes amongst the parties that form the Kurdistan Regional Government, and pressure being placed on the Ministry 
of Natural Resources, may lead to a change in the composition of the government or the removal of ministers that may have  
a detrimental effect on Genel’s relationships.
The Company has been operating in the region since 2002 and 
hence has a long history of working effectively with the KRG and 
contributing to the development of its natural resources industry. 
The Company maintains regular dialogue with the KRG and  
seeks to work collaboratively with the KRG, local communities, 
local suppliers and subcontractors to achieve mutually  
benefical objectives.
The KRI natural resources industry has made significant 
operational progress in 2015 in both establishing an independent 
oil export route and increasing production volumes.
For the Company, 2015 has seen progress made towards  
both the normalisation of payments for export sales and the 
development of the Company gas assets. The development  
of the Company’s gas assets is an important part of the KRG’s 
contractual commitment to deliver gas to Turkey.

RISK DESCRIPTION AND IMPACT MITIGATION AND MANAGEMENT ASSESSMENT CHANGE
Board
Recovery of 
amounts owed 
for export sales
The Company sells its exported oil to the KRG and therefore is reliant on the KRG for payment. In addition to being paid for 
current sales, the Company is owed a significant balance, reported in the balance sheet as $423 million, for sales made in  
the past.
The KRG has always been fully committed to paying the Company full entitlement but has been unable to do so for a number  
of reasons, including: non-payment of monies to the KRG by the FGI for monies owed for both pre-2014 export sales and budget 
allocations; underpayment of budget allocations by the FGI in 2015; severe financial stress on the KRI fiscal regime as a result  
of decreased oil price; a significant number of displaced people coming to the region as a result of the conflict with ISIS in Syria 
and Iraq; and funding the war against ISIS.
Non-recovery of amounts owed for both past and current sales would have a significant impact on the liquidity and value of the 
business and significantly impact its access to capital markets, sources of debt or ability to refinance.
The Company’s principal management of the risk is through its 
strong relationship and regular dialogue with the KRG. 
Over the past year , management has worked with the KRG to  
put in place processes that are expected to facilitate both regular 
payment and recovery of amounts owed at a time when KRG 
finances are under significant stress.
At the same time, the Company has maintained liquidity  
and a robust balance sheet by accessing capital markets 
opportunistically.
The Company is in regular dialogue with the KRG  
and has confidence that the KRG will stand by its  
contractual commitments. 
The KRG has consistently publicly committed to full payment  
of IOCs and the Company recognises the significant progress 
that has been made in the last year at a time when oil price  
has remained low.
Firstly, five monthly payments have been received from the  
KRG between September 2015 and the end of February 2016.
Secondly, on 1 February 2016 the KRG announced a regularised 
payment mechanism that included a repayment process for the 
accrued receivable. The KRG made an additional commitment 
that the allocation of revenues to IOCs would be raised following 
an increase in oil price.
Further explanation is provided in the Chief Executive’s 
statement on page 13.
 Unchanged
Regional risk
There is a history of political and social instability in Iraq and of disputes between the FGI and the KRG. In 2015, additional 
pressure was added to the political and social instability of Iraq by the economic uncertainty caused by the fall in oil price 
relative to 2014 and the continued military conflict with ISIS. This has caused significant economic challenges to both the  
KRG and the FGI, which both parties are working to overcome. 
Deterioration in the economic, political, diplomatic or social circumstances of Iraq and the KRI, or in the security of the KRI 
border with Iraq, would represent an increased risk to the operations, revenue, security and development of the Company.
The KRG is dependent on its continuing good relationship with Turkey to maintain its export route for its oil production and also 
intends to market its gas to Turkey in the future. Both these arrangements are underpinned by the energy deal between Turkey 
and the KRG that was signed in 2013.
The Company is a significant producer of the oil that is exported through Turkey and will be a cornerstone provider of the  
gas that the KRG intends to supply to Turkey. Should diplomatic relations between the KRG and Turkey deteriorate, this may 
have a negative impact on the Company’s operations and potentially impact the cash flows, planned growth and valuation  
of the Company. 
The Company assesses political, social, legal and economic risks  
as part of its business model and in the evaluation of its projects 
and investment decisions. 
The Company actively monitors developments in Iraq and the KRI, 
as well as the economic and political relationship between Turkey 
and the KRG so that it is positioned to make the appropriate 
decisions that mitigate risks as much as possible.
The Company has taken measures to protect its employees, 
equipment and other assets from security risks. Steps include  
the provision of security personnel and surveillance equipment, 
and the imposition of security checks and procedures at the sites 
that it operates. However , there can be no guarantee that such 
measures will prove effective against all safety risks.
The war in Iraq and increased economic risk in the region 
increased the risk of social and political instability. Against  
this difficult backdrop, the KRI borders have remained safe  
and secure. In May 2015, following underpayment of budget 
allocations by the FGI, the KRG returned to the independent 
export sales that it had established in 2014. The success of its 
independent oil exports has been facilitated by the continued 
strength of the KRG’s relationship with Turkey.
Throughout the second half of 2015, the KRG and FGI reiterated 
their intentions to work together and dialogue between the two 
governments is ongoing.

Risk of new 
hydrocarbon 
legislation  
in the KRI
There remains an ongoing dialogue between the KRG and the FGI in relation to both monies owed to the KRG for past exports 
and awarding of new PSCs, and there is an ongoing risk that new laws may be enacted in the future, governing the regulation  
of Iraqi oil and gas resources.
The enactment of any new law may alter the regulation of oil and gas resources in Iraq and the KRI, reduce the value of the 
Company’s existing PSCs and increase the regulatory requirements placed on the Company. Additionally, depending on the 
content of any future enacted law, the Company’s existing PSCs with the KRG may be subject to review or revision of terms.
In the past, the Iraqi Ministry of Oil has disputed the validity of PSCs entered into by the KRG, which granted the licences to the 
Company’s principal assets. If the validity of the Company’s PSCs were successfully challenged, the Company could be required 
by the KRG to accept contractor entitlements that may be materially less favourable than the current PSCs.
The Company has regular dialogue with the KRG and is not aware 
of any current plans for the enactment of new oil and gas laws 
that would impact its assets.
Based on legal advice obtained by the Company, the directors 
believe that the Company has good title to its oil and gas assets.
Throughout the second half of 2015, the KRG and FGI reiterated 
their intentions to work together and resolve differences. There 
have been no new laws or regulations implemented in 2015 that 
might impact the Company’s PSCs.

rights may be suspended, terminated or revoked prior to their expiration.
The Company conducts its exploration, development and production operations pursuant to drilling rights under a wide variety 
of licences. There can be no assurance that the host government will not significantly alter the conditions of, or that any 
third-party will not challenge, the licences held by the Company.
The Company continues to maintain a regular dialogue with  
its key stakeholders in the region, such as the KRG, the Turkish 
government and other regional public bodies, and expects  
to obtain and maintain all approvals necessary to operate  
its business.
There have been no new laws or regulations introduced in 2015

Local 
communities
Local communities may regard IOC operations as detrimental to their environmental, economic or social circumstances.
Currently the economic challenges faced by the KRG have led to a backlog in salary payments to public sector workers at  
a time that payments have been made to IOCs. Failure to manage relationships with local communities, government and 
non-government organisations could adversely affect the Company, and negatively impact the Company’s ability to operate 
efficiently or its ability to finance an operation. A loss of local community support could give rise to disruption to projects  
or operations, or cause material reputational damage, which could in turn affect the Company’s revenues, operations,  
and cash flows. 
An ongoing community investment and education programme, 
and commitment to providing local employment.
The financial strain of supporting the significant influx of refugees 
and IDPs into the KRI, compounded with the fall in the oil price  
and the failure of the FGI to make full budgetary payments, has 
worsened the financial situation of the KRG. The consequent 
failure by the KRG to pay salaries of civil servants has led to 
sporadic civil disturbances in the KRI, and increased the risk  
of local community unrest in the last 12 months.
Examples of work done by the Company with local communities 
is provided on pages 30 and 31.
 Increased
Health and  
safety risks
The Company’s operations are subject to general and specific regulations and restrictions governing workplace health and 
safety requirements, environmental requirements, social impacts, and other laws and regulations.
The Company’s primary operational safety risks are those inherent in the oil and gas industry, including the release of hydrogen 
sulphide gas during flaring, fires, blowouts, explosions, equipment or system failures and transportation accidents, which may 
result in death or injury to staff or local residents.
Certain of the Company’s operations may also create environmental risks in the form of spills, the release of gas or soil 
contamination from site operations, recycling and waste disposal. 
Unexpected disruptions in the supply of essential utility services, such as water and electricity, could halt or delay the 
recommencement of Company’s production operations. A health, safety or environmental incident could lead to the Company 
having to make material changes to its facilities or processes and pay compensation to any injured parties. There can be  
no assurance that the Company will not incur substantial financial obligations, which may lead to an adverse effect on the 
Company’s business, financial condition and prospects.
The Company has implemented health, safety and environmental 
policies and complies with international standards for crude oil 
exploration and production, for example those issued by the 
International Association of Oil and Gas Producers. 
The Company monitors compliance with its health, safety and 
environment policies regularly through a reporting system, 
inspections, third-party audits and management site inspections 
as overseen by the Company HSSE Committee.
The Company has put in place production operation and 
maintenance procedures to minimise the impact of unexpected 
disruptions to the supply of essential utility services.

The Directors considered these cash flow scenarios using a base 
case oil price outlined in our impairment note on page 89. The 
underlying assumptions were stress tested and reviewed, in the 
context of the Company’s liquidity and the principal risks of the 
region and industry in which it operates and with regard to the  
risks set out in the Principal Risks on pages 34 to 38 including:
 - Recovery of amounts owed for export sales
 - Development and recovery of reserves and resources
 - Major capital projects
 - KRI natural resources industry
 - Regional risk
The Directors also considered the Company’s outstanding $730 
million bond and the likely refinancing options on its maturity in 
2019, together with the results of interim covenant tests, again in the 
context of the Company’s current cash balance of $455 million and 
the expected recovery of the $423 million receivable from the KRG.
Based on their assessment of this analysis, the Directors have a 
reasonable expectation that the Company will be able to continue  
in operation and manage its liabilities as they fall due over the 
three-year period to June 2019.
Our 2015 strategic report, as set out on pages 1 to 39, has been 
reviewed and approved by the Board of Directors on 2 March 2016.

Chief Executive Officer
Viability statement
In accordance with provision C.2.2 of the 2014 revision of the  
Code, the Directors have assessed the prospects of the Company 
over a longer period than the 12 months required by the ‘Going 
Concern’ provision. 
The Directors conducted this review for the period up to June 2019, 
which was felt to be an appropriate period for the following reasons:
•  it aligns with the Board’s strategic activity plan
• it captures the maturity of the Company’s senior unsecured bonds 
• forecasting further than three years is likely to be inaccurate given 
oil price volatility 
The Company benefits from a proven producing oil reserves base 
that allows us to create production and associated cash flow 
scenarios covering the forecast period. The low-cost onshore nature 
of our oil business, together with the terms of our Production 
Sharing Agreements, results in an asset cash flow profile that is 
resilient to commodity prices below current market levels. In 
particular, we benefit from asset level operating costs of less than 
$2 per barrel and currently forecast asset level cash flow neutrality 
after capital expenditures at an oil price under $20 per barrel. 
The Company has ownership of a material gas development project 
that has not yet progressed to a final investment decision and so  
has limited committed cash spend. The project is expected to be 
financed predominantly through asset farm-outs and project 
financing and is expected to generate material positive cash  
flows for the Company after the forecast period.

genelenergy.com Committed to operating  
to the highest standards  
of corporate governance
CORPORATE GOVERNANCE
I am pleased to present my first Corporate 
Governance Report to shareholders as your 
new Chairman. 
This has been a year of significant transition 
in the composition of your Board. Julian 
Metherell and Mark Parris stood down  
as Directors at the end of our 2015 AGM.  
In July, Rodney Chase stood down as 
Chairman and Murat Özgül, a longstanding 
member of the Genel executive team, was 
appointed CEO. The Board felt that as a 
founding member of the Company it was 
appropriate that, on this occasion and as  
an exception to the Code, I be appointed to 
the role of Chairman in order to continue 
supporting the development of the Company 
in the challenging environment that we  
are operating in. Murat Özgül has overseen  
the growth of our KRI oil production and  
is very well qualified as CEO to progress  
the development of our world class KRI  
gas fields.
Furthermore, on 19 January 2016 and 23 
February 2016 respectively, we announced 
that as part of the ongoing evolution of the 
Board, Sir Graham Hearne would stand 
down as an Independent Non-Executive 
Director and Jim Leng would stand down as 
the Senior Independent and Non-Executive 
Director, both at the conclusion of the 2016 
AGM. George Rose would be appointed 
Senior Independent Director in Jim’s stead. 
Simon Lockett was appointed on 19 January 
2016 as an Independent Non-Executive 
Director and has also joined the HSSE and 
Remuneration Committees.
Mehmet Sepil, Genel’s founder, retired  
from his position as President in October to 
pursue other interests. In December, Murat 
Yazici also stood down as a Non-Executive 
Director as Mehmet Sepil reduced his 
shareholding to below 10%, thereby losing 
his right to nominate a Director to the Board. 
Following my appointment as Chairman,  
I have ensured that we remain committed  
to operating at the highest standards of 
corporate governance to support us in 
delivering on our business objectives. 
The Board, assisted by the work of the  
Audit Committee, keeps under review the 
governance framework, risk management 
and internal controls.
We comply with the UK Corporate 
Governance Code as appropriate to support 
our business and as such, and in accordance 
with our shareholder approved Remuneration 
Policy, have voluntarily applied malus  
and clawback to all performance related 
remuneration made to executives during the 
year. Details of how we have applied malus 
and clawback to our remuneration 
arrangements are set out in the annual 
report on remuneration on pages 58 and 62.
In April/May 2015 we successfully issued  
and listed a further $230m 7.5% senior 
unsecured bonds on the Nordic ABN 
Exchange adding further strength to  
our balance sheet.
We have continued to monitor our 
performance as a Board. In last year’s 
annual report we had undertaken to 
complete an external effectiveness review  
in 2015, however, given the Board changes 
during the year it was felt appropriate to 
complete an internal effectiveness review 
for 2015.
More details of the findings and our 
improvement programme are set out  
in this report.

DIRECTORS’ REPORT AND GOVERNANCE
45
Genel Energy plc Annual Report 2015
genelenergy.com CORPORATE GOVERNANCE
Corporate governance 
Our objective remains to create long-term 
value for shareholders through the 
exploration, development and production of 
oil and gas resources. We have high quality 
assets that are important to the growth of 
the Kurdistan region and Turkey. In doing 
this, we have committed to a high level of 
governance and to developing a culture  
that values exemplary ethical standards, 
personal and corporate integrity and 
respect for others. The Board governs  
the Company consistent with our business 
strategy and commitment to a transparent 
and high-quality governance system.
Our view is that governance is not just a 
matter for the Board and that a strong 
governance culture must be fostered 
throughout the organisation. Our 
expectations of our employees and of  
those with whom we conduct business  
are set out in our code of conduct, which  
is summarised below and is available on  
our website at www.genelenergy.com
This report aims to provide shareholders with 
a comprehensive summary of our governance 
arrangements and an explanation of how the 
Company has approached the main principles 
of the UK Corporate Governance Code (the 
‘Code’) during 2015.
Genel Energy plc is a Jersey incorporated 
company with a standard listing on the 
London Stock Exchange. Notwithstanding  
our standard listing, we are committed to 
complying with the regulatory requirements 
in both Jersey and the UK, together with 
prevailing standards of best practice, as if  
we were a premium listed company. We are  
in full compliance with the provisions of the 
Code with the exception of A.3.1 due to Tony 
Hayward being appointed Chairman of Genel 
on 12 July 2015 having previously served as 
CEO. Accordingly, he was not independent  
on appointment. Whilst in his role as CEO, 
Tony Hayward was also appointed Chairman 
of Glencore plc and as such, for the period  
to 12 July 2015 we were not in compliance 
with provision B.3.3. of the Code. It has  
also been decided to undertake an internal 
effectiveness review rather than an externally 
facilitated review for 2015 due to the changes 
on the Board during the year as described on 
page 47. A copy of the Code can be found at 
www.frc.org.uk/corporate/ukcgcode.cfm 
As corporate governance principles continue 
to evolve, we will continue to adopt best 
practice guidelines as appropriate to our 
business. For example, in 2015, in line with 
our undertaking to adopt the changes to  
the Code, we applied malus and clawback  
to performance related remuneration for 
our executive management team.
Model code
We have voluntarily adopted the model code 
for share dealing as set out in the Listing Rules. 
The Board is responsible for taking all proper 
and reasonable steps to ensure compliance 
with the model code, including training staff  
in the requirements set out in the model code.
We will be reviewing our share dealing policies 
during the course of the upcoming year to 
align with the new Market Abuse regime 
coming into effect in July 2016.
Code of conduct
Our code of conduct defines what we stand 
for as a Company and sets out the principles 
that guide all of our business activities.  
All staff have received training on how to 
represent Genel in accordance with the 
principles of the code of conduct. We strive 
for operational excellence and aim to 
conduct our business in a responsible, 
ethical and safe manner with the highest 
standards of financial reporting, corporate 
governance, and compliance with applicable 
laws. The code of conduct sets guidelines  
by which we conduct our business and how 
we expect our board, employees, suppliers, 
partners and others to behave. As a result, 
being able to demonstrate behaviours 
aligned with the code of conduct forms  
part of the performance objectives for  
every employee.
SpeakUp
All employees are encouraged to raise any 
concerns they may have and to report any 
suspected or known violations of the code  
of conduct without fear of retaliation. We 
operate an independently run and confidential 
‘SpeakUp’ hotline. All issues raised via this 
route are reported to the Audit Committee.
Business conduct
We conduct our business in an open, honest 
and ethical manner. We do not tolerate any 
form of bribery. We aim to ensure that all 
financial and non-financial information we 
create is complete and accurate, and we 
strive to provide accurate and timely 
information to external stakeholders, 
including governments, in the locations in 
which we operate. We take steps to protect 
against inappropriate use of confidential and 
privileged information and we aim to protect 
and use our business assets appropriately.
Our policy is not to make political donations 
and we have not done so in the period under 
review (2014: nil).
Conflicts of interest
We seek to avoid conflicts of interest 
wherever possible. We believe it is important 
that the decision making process is not 
impaired by an individual being conflicted  
by either an actual or a potential conflict. 
However, we recognise that from time to  
time situations may arise which could result in 
actual or potential conflicts and, accordingly, 
we have a formal system in place enabling 
Directors and members of the executive team 
to declare any such conflicts and for those 
conflicts to be reviewed and, if appropriate, 
authorised by the Board. A register of 
conflicts is maintained by the Company 
Secretary. The Audit Committee and the 
Board have applied the principles and 
processes set out above during 2015 and 
confirm that they have operated effectively.
Third parties
We maintain high standards of business 
conduct in our dealings with all third parties 
in order to promote mutually beneficial 
46
Genel Energy plc Annual Report 2015
genelenergy.com relationships and protect our reputation.  
We do not seek to win or maintain business 
by acting illegally or contrary to our 
contractual agreements. Our relationships 
with third parties are conducted on a fair 
and honest basis. We expect our third 
parties to maintain the same standards  
of business conduct as we adhere to.
Communities and environment
Protecting and sustaining the communities 
and environment in which we operate  
is fundamental to maintaining our  
operating licences and to creating a 
long-term sustainable business. We strive  
to maintain high standards of environmental 
protection and we do not compromise  
our environmental values for profit or 
production. We seek to maintain proactive 
and constructive engagement with the local 
communities affected by our operations and 
assets, and invest to help them develop in  
a sustainable manner. We contribute to 
socio-economic development and provide 
transparency in respect of our contributions 
and their impact. Further information on 
how we engage with communities can be 
found in the community engagement and 
investment section of this report on pages 
26 to 31.
The role of the Board
The Board’s role is to provide leadership in 
delivering on the long-term success of the 
Company. It is responsible for approving the 
Company’s strategy and the business plan 
and keeping under review the financial and 
operational resources of the Company.  
It monitors the performance of the business 
and management against those strategic 
objectives with the overall objective of 
creating and delivering value to shareholders.
The performance of the Board and the 
contributions of Directors to the Board’s 
decision making processes are essential  
to fulfilling this role. The Directors may 
exercise all the powers of the Company 
subject to the provisions of relevant law, 
the Company’s articles and any special 
resolution of the Company in the 
furtherance of their role. 
The Board has reserved certain matters for 
its own consideration and decision making. 
Authorities have been delegated to Board 
Committees and these are set out clearly in 
each Committee’s terms of reference which 
are available on our website.
Specific matters reserved for the Board 
include setting the Company’s objectives and 
business strategy and its overall supervision. 
Significant acquisitions, divestments and other 
strategic decisions will all be considered and 
determined by the Board in accordance with 
the Company’s delegated authorities matrix. 
The Board provides leadership within  
a framework of prudent and effective controls.
The Board reviews the matters reserved  
for its decision annually, subject to the 
limitations imposed by the Company’s 
constitutional documents and applicable law.
The Board and its Committees have access 
to the advice and services of the Company 
Secretary and the General Counsel and may 
seek advice from independent experts at  
the expense of the Company as appropriate. 
Individual Directors may also seek 
independent legal advice at the expense of 
the Company, in accordance with the Board’s 
agreed procedure.
In addition, the Board has extensive access 
to members of senior management, who 
attend Board meetings by invitation from 
time to time, and present to the Board on 
the performance of the business.
Board composition
There are ten Directors on the Board, of 
whom one is Executive and nine (including 
the Chairman) Non-Executive. Six are 
independent under the Code and four are 
considered not independent (including the 
Chairman) who was not considered 
independent on appointment.

Graham Hearne and Jim Leng would  
retire as Director’s of the Company at the 
conclusion of the 2016 AGM. Simon Lockett

Roles and responsibilities
There is a clear division of roles between the Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and Senior Independent Director of the Company.
Further details of the Directors and their 
experience are set out on pages 42 to 44  
of this annual report.
Each Director will be submitted for  
re-election at the 2016 AGM (save  
for Sir Graham Hearne and Jim Leng,  
who will retire as Director’s on the  
date of the 2016 AGM).
Meetings of the Board
The Board meets around seven times  
each year and schedules other meetings  
as necessary to fulfil its role. During the year 
we held eight meetings in various locations. 
One of those meetings was in addition to 
those scheduled. The Board receives 
updates from management inbetween 
meetings on the performance  
of the business against the agreed strategy  
and on its operations and has a rolling 
agenda that sets out the key topics for 
consideration at each meeting.
Independence of the Board
Following the retirement of Graham Hearne 
and Jim Leng as Directors, the Independent 
Non-Executive Director’s (George Rose, 
Chakib Sbiti, Simon Lockett and Mehmet 
Ög ˘ütçü) make up exactly half the Board  
and are responsible for ensuring that the 
management and decisions of the Board 
are properly checked and balanced. The 
Independent Directors meet in private 
session at the end of each scheduled Board 
meeting of which there were seven such 
meetings during 2015.

Genel Energy plc Annual Report 2015
genelenergy.com The Directors who are not independent 
comprise the founders of the Company 
(Nathaniel Rothschild, Non-Executive 
Director and Tony Hayward, Chairman)  
plus Gulsun Nazli Karamehmet Williams 
who has been nominated for appointment 
to the Board by Focus Investments.
The Board considers that there is an 
appropriate balance between Executive  
and Non-Executive, independent and 
non-independent Directors, with a view  
to promoting shareholder interests and 
governing the business effectively.
Skills, knowledge, experience and 
attributes of Directors 
The Board considers that a diversity of  
skills, background, knowledge, experience, 
perspective and gender is required in order 
to govern the business effectively. The 
Board and its Committees work actively  
to ensure that the Executive and Non-
Executive Directors continue to have  
the right balance of skills, experience, 
independence and group knowledge 
necessary to discharge their responsibilities 
in accordance with the highest standards  
of governance.
The Non-Executive Directors bring  
with them international and operational 
experience gained both in the sectors in 
which we operate and in other areas of 
business and public life. Murat Özgül brings 
additional perspectives to the Board’s  
work through a deep understanding of  
the business. Together they oversee the 
strategy of the Group and monitor the 
pursuit of the corporate strategy. All 
Directors are required to devote sufficient 
time and demonstrate commitment to  
their role.
Operation of the Board
The Chairman is responsible for  
ensuring that the Board operates 
effectively. The Board has an open style  
of communication and debates issues  
openly and constructively within an 
environment that encourages healthy 
debate and challenge both inside and 
outside the boardroom.
The Directors receive board papers and 
other relevant information in a timely 
manner ahead of meetings. Board papers 
are delivered through an electronic portal 
that enables Directors to access them 
wherever they are in the world. The timely 
provision of relevant information to 
Directors is vital in ensuring they are  
able to fulfil their role of effective  
oversight and challenge and for enabling 
the Board to make effective decisions.
Directors’ induction and ongoing 
development
In order to govern the Group effectively, 
Non-Executive Directors must have a  
clear understanding of the overall strategy, 
together with a sound knowledge of the 
business and the industry within which  
it operates.
The Chairman, together with the Company 
Secretary, is responsible for ensuring that 
all new directors receive a full, formal and 
tailored induction upon appointment to the 
Board. This includes a detailed overview of 
the Company and its governance practices 
and meetings with key personnel from 
across the Group in order to develop a full 
understanding of the business, its strategy 
and business priorities in each area.
Upon his appointment Simon Lockett 
received a full and comprehensive 
induction on the operations, processes, 
policies and procedures across the 
business. The induction included a 
comprehensive schedule of meetings  
with senior management on the  
operations and controls of the business.
Risk monitoring and reporting
The Group keeps under constant scrutiny 
the major risks to which its operations in all 
regions are exposed by leveraging its local 
expertise, industry knowledge and strategic 
relationships. In particular, the Group 
continues to have a regular dialogue  
with its key stakeholders in the Kurdistan 
Region of Iraq, such as the KRG, the Turkish 
government and other regional public 
bodies. We maintain similar relationships 
within the Africa region to ensure the risks 
across the organisation as a whole are  
fully understood and mitigated.
The Group’s risk management process, 
established by the executive management 
and endorsed by the Board, is used to 
identify the key risks to the business,  
the controls by which these are managed, 
and how these controls are monitored. The 
executive management review and update 
the risk management process and the risks 
identified on a quarterly basis. The Board 
undertakes a robust assessment of the 
principal risks facing the Company at least 
annually. It focuses its assessment on those 
risks that could impact our business model, 
solvancy, liquidity or future performance. 
The Board also reviews and monitors the 
risk management and internal control 
systems and each such review covers  
all material controls, including financial, 
operational and compliance controls.
Further details of the principal risks  
and uncertainties to which the Group’s 
operations are exposed, and the framework 
within which these risks are managed,  
are set out on pages 34 to 39 of this  
annual report.

continued
Board effectiveness
In our last annual report we indicated our intention to commission an external effectiveness review in 2015. However, given the number of 
changes at Board level, including at the Chairman and CEO level, it was felt appropriate to conduct an additional internal review in 2015 to 
allow the Board to embed. The 2015 review was facilitated by the Company Secretary. 
2014 actions for the year Progress made against the actions
Board composition and balance The Nomination Committee will continue  
to keep under review the composition of  
the Board with the aim of ensuring that an 
appropriate balance of skills and experience  
is present in the boardroom.
Simon Lockett was appointed to the Board on 19 January 
2016, strengthening oil & gas representation on the Board. 
Sir Graham Hearne and Jim Leng will stand down as 
Director’s at the 2016 AGM. 
The Nomination Committee keeps under review the 
composition of the Board to ensure that it remains 
appropriate both in size and skill set.
Strategy It was recognised that whilst the business  
had a clear strategic agenda for business 
development, in the context of a falling oil  
price and tensions in the region, the strategic 
agenda would be kept under close scrutiny  
in light of the risks facing the business.
The Board has closely monitored the risks faced by the 
business during the year, including the impact of a falling 
oil price. Internal Audit also conducted a review of security 
in light of the potential security risks posed by the 
instability in the region. The Board was satisfied that the 
risks were being managed and mitigated appropriately.
Risk management During the year, a Head of Internal Audit was 
appointed to reflect the growing complexity  
of the business. The Directors will keep under 
review the internal audit programme and the 
effectiveness of bringing internal audit 
in-house.
The Head of Internal Audit reported to the Audit Committee 
on the first full year’s work since his appointment. The 
business had been supportive of the work of Internal Audit 
and had responded well to any audit findings taking swift 
remedial action in a timely manner. The Committee is of the 
opinion that the appointment of a full time Head of Internal 
Audit has proved effective.
2015 actions
Board development Given the significance of the gas development to the Company, the Board would focus its development plan 
for the year on the development cycle of the gas project, including project financing.
Board effectiveness It was recognised that following the changes to Board composition during the year, the need to ensure that 
the new Board operated effectively was a priority for 2016.
Political risk During the year, the Political Risk Committee was disbanded as it was felt that given the importance of 
political risk to the Company, this should be a matter for the whole Board. As this is a complex region in 
which to operate regular updates would be provided to Directors from appropriate commentators.
Remuneration Whilst the Remuneration Committee scrutinises management targets when considering remuneration 
payouts to the executives, it will pay particular attention to this area given the difficult economic 
environment the Company is operating in.
The Board considers that each of the Directors continues to make an effective and valuable contribution and demonstrates their 
commitment to the role. Accordingly, the Board recommends the election/ re-election of each Director with the exception of Sir Graham 
Hearne and Jim Leng who will both stand down at the 2016 AGM.

Internal controls
The Board is responsible for maintaining and 
reviewing the effectiveness of the Group’s 
system of internal control. This system is 
designed to identify, evaluate and manage 
the significant risks to which the Group is 
exposed. The Board has established 
processes to meet the expectations of the 
UK Corporate Governance Code and those of 
a premium listed company. These processes 
were developed further during 2015 to 
reflect the most recent changes to the Code 
requiring companies to publish long-term 
viability statements and to continually 
monitor systems of risk management and 
internal control. Our long-term viability 
statement can be found on page 38. These 
processes include having clear lines of 
responsibility, documented levels of 
delegated authority and appropriate 
operating procedures. We recognise that  
the system is designed to manage, rather 
than eliminate, the risk of failure to achieve 
business objectives, and can only provide 
reasonable, and not absolute, assurance 
against misstatement or loss.
The Audit Committee supports the Board  
in the performance of its responsibilities by 
reviewing those procedures that relate to 
risk management processes and financial 
controls. The Audit Committee considers the 
reports of the internal audit function and the 
external auditor and reports to the Board on 
such matters as it feels should be brought to 
the Board’s attention.
A detailed budget is produced annually  
in accordance with our financial processes 
and reviewed and approved by the Board. 
Operational reports are provided to 
executive management on a monthly basis 
and performance against the budget kept 
under regular review in accordance with  
the Group’s financial procedures manual.  
The Chief Executive Officer reports to the 
Board on performance and key issues as 
they arise.
The assessment of controls and risk 
management processes provide a reasonable 
basis for the Board to make proper 
judgements on an ongoing basis as to the 
financial position and prospects of the Group.
The Board has conducted a review of the 
effectiveness of the system of internal 
control for the year ended 31 December 
2015 and up to the date of the signing of  
the financial statements, and is satisfied  
that it remains appropriate to the business.
Communication with stakeholders
Part of the Group’s code of conduct sets  
a framework for how it partners with, and 
invests in, communities (local, regional and 
global) to achieve mutual long-term benefits. 
The Group contributes to socio-economic 
development through taxes, royalties and 
other local payments and donations. Further 
details of our community programmes can be 
found on pages 26 to 31 of this annual report.
2016 AGM
The 2016 AGM will be held on Wednesday,  
27 April 2016 at Linklaters LLP, One Silk 
Street, London, EC2Y 8HQ UK at 11.00am. 
The notice of AGM accompanies this annual 
report and sets out the business to be 
considered at the meeting. The AGM will 
provide an opportunity for shareholders  
to meet with the Directors and senior 
management. Both this annual report  
and the notice of AGM are available on  
our website at www.genelenergy.com
Communication with institutional investors
We communicate on a regular basis with our 
shareholders via presentations, calls and 
scheduled investor trips as part of our 
annual investor calendar. We also liaise  
with them on an ad hoc basis as and when 
questions arise. 
Our major shareholders are also encouraged 
to meet with the Chairman to discuss any 
matters that they would like to raise outside 
the formal investor calendar. Tony Hayward 
has maintained a regular dialogue with 
major shareholders following his 
appointment as Chairman.
The Board receives investor relations 
updates at each scheduled Board meeting 
covering key investor meetings and 
activities, as well as shareholder and 
investor feedback.
We also engage with our shareholders  
at our AGM and via our website at  
www.genelenergy.com
Board committees
The Board has established four committees: 
the Audit Committee, the Remuneration 
Committee, the Nomination Committee  
and the Health, Safety, Security and 
Environment Committee. 
The Political Risk Committee was disbanded 
during the year as it was felt political risk 
was a matter for the whole Board.
These Committees have adopted terms  
of reference under which authority is 
delegated by the Board and copies of  
which are available on our website at  
www.genelenergy.com. Each Committee 
consists only of Independent Non-Executive 
Directors (with the exception of the 
Nomination Committee which is chaired  
by Tony Hayward who was not independent 
on his appointment as Chairman).

Genel Energy plc Annual Report 2015
genelenergy.com The significant issues considered by the 
Committee in relation to the 2015 accounts 
and how these were addressed were:
• Impairment triggers were reviewed 
following the announcement on  
29 February of a revision in the estimate  
of the initial gross recoverable proven  
and probable reserves from 683 to 356 
mmbbls as well as significant change  
in the oil price
• Reserves and resources – an internal 
review of the reserves and resources was 
conducted following production declines 
seen at the field during 2015. The updated 
McDaniel Competent Person’s Report will 
be completed shortly
• Risk reporting – the Committee considered 
and endorsed a paper prepared by 
management setting out further 
enhancements to the process for oversight 
and the reporting of risk, controls and 
assurance to the Committee and the Board
Internal audit
In September 2014, a full time Head of 
Internal Audit was appointed. Each year the 
Committee approves an internal audit plan 
for the year ahead which is aligned to the 
Group’s risk matrix, the outcome of the 
previous year’s audit and the outcome of  
the annual assessment of the effectiveness 
of internal control. In November 2015 the 
Committee reviewed the internal audit 
output for the first full year operating under 
the new model and was satisfied that the 
internal audit process had been enhanced  
as a result of the change in approach. 
External audit
The effectiveness and the independence of 
the external auditor are key to ensuring the 
integrity of the Group’s published financial 
information. Prior to the commencement  
of the audit, the Committee reviews and 
approves the external auditor’s audit plan. 
PwC present to the Committee their 
proposed plan of work which is designed  
to ensure that there are no material 
misstatements in the financial statements.
The Committee monitors and approves  
the provision of non-audit services by  
the Company’s external auditors and has  
in place a policy on non-audit services.  
The provision of non-audit services is 
generally limited to services that are  
closely connected to the external audit  
or to projects that require a detailed 
understanding of the Group (for  
example, taxation advice) which require 
pre-authorisation by the Committee  
under the terms of the policy.
The level of non-audit fees for 2015 was 
$0.2m, further details of which can be found 
on page 92 of the notes to the financial 
statements. These fees reflect the services 
and advice provided by PwC in respect of tax 
during the year. PwC have been appointed 
as the Company’s auditors for the past four 
years following a tendering process in 2011. 
When considering the re-appointment of  
the Company’s external auditors, the 
Committee reviewed the external auditor’s 
independence and objectivity and the  
overall effectiveness of the audit process.
At its meeting in November 2015, the 
Committee reviewed the effectiveness  
of the external audit process. It reviewed 
papers from both management and the 
external auditors, which set out the planning 
and execution of the audit process. The 
Audit Committee met privately with the 
external auditors in the absence of 
management. Following this review, the 
Audit Committee was satisfied that the 
external auditor remains both effective  
and independent and on that basis we  
will be recommending their reappointment 
at the forthcoming AGM.
The Committee reviewed its own 
effectiveness during the year. The 
Committee has also reviewed its terms  
of reference to ensure they reflect its 
responsibilities in the context of the review 
of internal financial control systems and 
financial risk management systems. The 
Committee terms of reference can be found 
on our website at www.genelenergy.com

Spencer Stuart, an independent external 
search agency, to assist with the refreshing 
of the Board over time. As part of their  
remit they were asked to provide a pool  
of candidates from a diverse range of 
backgrounds and with due regard to gender 
diversity. Spencer Stuart have no other 
connection with the Company.
When considering the appointment of Simon 
Lockett to the Board all candidates were 
assessed on merit with the express desire  
to retain oil and gas expertise on the Board.
The Board and the Company are committed 
to employing a diverse and balanced 
workforce. Diversity of ideas, skills, 
knowledge, experience, culture, ethnicity 
and gender are important when building an 
effective and talented workforce at all levels 
of the organisation, including the Board.

and accordingly we comply with the 
remuneration aspects of the Code. As a 
consequence we have introduced clawback 
provisions for both the annual bonus and  
the PSP in respect of performance periods 
commencing in 2015.
Changes to Management Team
During the year the Company has seen 
changes to the executive director team. 
Julian Metherell, the Company’s CFO,  
retired on 21 April 2015, Tony Hayward 
stepped down as CEO on 12 July 2015 and 
was subsequently appointed as Chairman. 
Murat Özgül was appointed as Tony’s 
sucessor as a Director and CEO, also on  
12 July 2015.
Details of the remuneration arrangements 
regarding these Executive Director  
changes is set out in the annual report  
on remuneration on page 60. In summary,  
their salaries and cash supplements ceased 
on their respective departure dates and 
annual bonus opportunities were pro-rated  
to their periods in office as detailed below. 
On the appointment of Murat Özgül as CEO, 
the Committee were conscious of the need 
 to provide him with appropriate incentives 
during this critical time in the life of the 
Company and to more closely align his 
interests with those of shareholders.  
The Committee accordingly granted  
him an award of shares in respect of  
his appointment as CEO. Further details  
of this award are set out in the annual  
report on remuneration on page 60.
Remuneration for 2015
The past year was a very difficult one for  
the oil industry in general, with brent crude 
oil prices falling by 34%. Genel with its oil 
resources located in Kurdistan – Northern 
Iraq, had to deal with operating in a region 
with significant political and security 
challenges. In addition, in February 2016, 
following a review of the Taq Taq reservoir 
model, Genel announced an impairment  
of $1,038 million to the carrying value  
of the Taq Taq field, based on the revised 
assumptions on recoverable reserves and 
the impact of lower oil prices.
In the face of all these challenges the 
Committee has sought to ensure that 
remuneration. The Committee recognises 
that the Company did achieve strong 
performance in several areas, particularly 
operationally, which in normal circumstances 
would have resulted in a 2015 annual bonus 
outcome of 72.5% of maximum for Executive 
Directors (see page 59 for details of how 
Genel performed against these targets).  
However, having regard to the announcement 
of the 2015 impairment, the Committee 
determined that awards of this size would not 
be an appropriate outcome and so exercised 
its discretion to reduce the outcome by half. 
Consequentially the 2015 annual bonus 
outcome for Murat Özgül was 36.25%  
of maximum opportunity, pro-rated for  
the period he served as an Executive  
Director of the Company. Tony Hayward  
and Julian Metherell were eligible to be 
considered to receive pro-rated bonus awards 
for 2015 but elected to waive such eligibility.
Regarding the PSP awards granted in  
2013, Genel’s Total Shareholder Return  
(TSR) performance relative to the 13  
peer companies over the three years to 31 
December 2015 resulted in Genel finishing 
7th. This would normally have resulted in 
30% of the shares vesting. However, given 
the current challenges, and in particular the 
announcement of the 2015 impairment, the 
Committee, again exercised their discretion 
under the PSP, determining that no shares 
would vest and, as a result, the 2013 PSP 
awards lapsed in full.
Approach to 2016
The Committee has reviewed Murat Özgül’s 
salary for 2016 and, taking into account his 
recent appointment as CEO, and the difficult 
operating environment, it was agreed that no 
salary increase would be awarded in 2016.
Regarding PSP awards for 2016, the normal 
policy would be for the CEO to receive an 
award of 150% of salary. However, given the 
announcement of the 2015 impairment, the 
Committee intends to review its approach to 
the 2016 annual award in the coming months.
Further details of how we will apply our 
remuneration policy throughout the coming 
year are set out on page 62.
Structure of the report
This report is in two sections:
• The Directors’ annual report on 
remuneration on pages 58 to 62, sets  
out the details of how our remuneration 
policy was implemented during 2015  
and will be implemented during 2016.  
This report will be put to an advisory 
shareholder vote at our 2016 AGM; and
• The Directors’ remuneration policy report 
on pages 63 to 69. This contains details  
of the remuneration policy which was 
approved by Shareholders at the 2014 
AGM. As there are no changes to our 
approved policy, this policy will not be  
put to Shareholders at this year’s AGM.
On behalf of the Remuneration Committee,  
I am pleased to present the Directors’ 
Remuneration Report for the year ended  
31 December 2015.
Although as a Jersey registered company 
there is no legal requirement for us to 
prepare our remuneration report in 
accordance with the UK legislation on  
the disclosure of executive remuneration,  
it remains the policy of Genel to comply  
with the highest standards of corporate 
governance and we continue to do so 
voluntarily. Once again we have prepared 
our report in accordance with the Large  
and Medium-sized Companies and Groups 
(Accounts and Reports) Regulations 2008 
(as amended), as well as the provisions  
of the UK Corporate Governance Code  
(the Code) and the UK Listing Rules as  
they apply to premium listed companies.
Our remuneration policy continues to  
offer a clear remuneration structure for  
our executives with four components:  
base salary, a cash supplement in lieu  
of all benefits (including pension), an  
annual cash bonus and awards under the 
performance share plan (PSP). Furthermore, 
any shares vesting under the PSP are 
normally retained for an additional three 
years, making this a six year period from 
award to unrestricted ownership.
Our remuneration policy has been designed 
to appropriately support the delivery of  
our strategic objectives. Both the annual 
bonus and PSP awards have stretching 
performance targets that have to be met 
and are aligned to the Company’s strategy.

is satisfied that the advice they have 
received has been objective and 
independent. Deloitte’s fees in respect  
of advice to the Committee in the year  
under review were £41,050 and were

subsequently Tony Hayward), CEO (Tony 
Hayward and subsequently Murat Özgül),

Genel Energy plc Annual Report 2015
genelenergy.com Annual bonus
The 2015 annual bonus scorecard was based on the Company’s 
performance against key business objectives (with a weighting  
of 70%) and individual performance (with a weighting of 30%).  
Key business objectives included financial and operational targets 
(45%), health and safety (15%) and people (10%).
Although Genel delivered strong performance against operational, 
safety and people capability objectives, inevitability the Company’s 
financial performance was impacted by the extremely difficult 
trading environment, both globally and in Kurdistan, as well as the 
Taq Taq reserves. Overall, the performance delivered would have,  
in normal circumstances, resulted in a 2015 annual bonus outcome 
of 72.5% of maximum. Details of the Company’s performance 
against each of the objectives are set out below.
However, in the context of the Taq Taq review the Committee 
determined that awards of this size would not be an appropriate 
outcome and so exercised their discretion to reduce the outcome  
by 50%. Consequentially the 2015 annual bonus outcome for  
Murat Özgül was 36.25% of maximum opportunity, pro-rated for  
the period he served as an Executive Director of the Company.  
Tony Hayward and Julian Metherell were eligible to be considered  
to receive pro-rated bonus awards for 2015 but elected to waive  
that eligibility and consequently received no bonus.

Performance share plan awards made in 2015
PSP awards are granted in the form of nil-cost options over shares  
in the Company with the number of options granted determined  
by reference to a percentage of base salary. The 2015 awards were 
based on a face value of 150% of salary for the CEO and 140% of 
salary for the CFO at the time of award.
The Committee decided that, for the 2015 awards, it would continue 
to measure the performance of the Company against that of its 
sectoral peers using a relative TSR measure. The Committee 
consider that TSR is the most appropriate measure to create 
maximum alignment with shareholders and encourage long-term 
value creation. The sectoral peer group for the 2015 PSP awards 
was reviewed in November 2014 to ensure that it remained 
appropriate. Following that review the Companies highlighted  
in bold below were added to the peer group.

CEO Award
On 21 August 2015 Murat Özgül was granted a share award over 375,000 shares in respect of his appointment to the role of CEO of the 
Company on 12 July 2015. The award was made under Listing Rule 9.4.2(2) and was granted in the form of a nil-cost option. The award will 
normally become exercisable in three tranches: 25% on the first anniversary of his appointment as CEO, 25% on the second anniversary 
and 50% on the third anniversary of appointment. Vesting is subject to his continued employment with the Company. To the extent that 
awards vest, his award will be exercisable until the tenth anniversary of his appointment. The award is non-pensionable.
Upon vesting, the acquired shares will be subject to a further holding period of three years from the vesting date. The other terms of the 
award are consistent with awards made under the RSP described in the Directors’ Remuneration Policy stated on page 64.
Retaining Murat Özgül as CEO is critical to the future success of the Company, in particular in navigating the exceptional circumstances 
related to our operations in Kurdistan. This award is intended to support the retention of the CEO and to more closely align his interests with 
those of shareholders over the next four to six years.
Payments to past Directors
Tony Hayward stepped down as CEO on 12 July 2015 and was appointed as Chairman. For the period 1 January to 12 July 2015 he received 
his base salary and benefits allowance as CEO. He was also eligible to be considered to receive a pro-rated annual bonus for this period but 
has since waived his eligibility. From 12 July 2015 onwards he received a fee for his role as Chairman. He did not receive a benefits allowance 
and was not eligible for an annual bonus in respect of his role as Chairman. In accordance with our remuneration policy, his outstanding PSP 
awards will continue, with performance assessed at the normal time and will remain subject to a three year holding period following vesting. 
He will not be granted any share awards in respect of his role as Chairman.
Julian Metherell retired as a Director on 21 April 2015. For the period 1 January to 21 April 2015 he received his base salary and benefits 
allowance. He was also eligible to be considered to receive a pro-rated annual bonus for this period but has since waived his eligibility. In 
accordance with our remuneration policy, his outstanding PSP awards were pro-rated based on the proportion of the performance period 
completed prior to his retirement. The performance conditions for these awards will be assessed at the normal time and vested awards will 
remain subject to a holding period which will expire three years after his retirement date.

Historical TSR performance and CEO remuneration outcomes
The following graph shows the Company’s TSR since trading of 
Genel Energy plc’s shares began on the London Stock Exchange on 
21 November 2011 against the FTSE 350 Oil & Gas Producers Index. 
The Committee believes that the FTSE 350 Oil & Gas Producers 
Index remains the most appropriate Index as these companies are 
Genel’s direct UK listed comparators.
Percentage change in remuneration of the Chief Executive Officer
The table below shows the percentage change in the Chief Executive 
Officer’s salary, benefits and annual bonus between the financial 2015 
compared to the average for permanent employees of the Group.

The percentage change in base salary for the CEO for 2015 includes 
data for Tony Hayward up to 12 July 2015 and Murat Özgül thereafter. 
The percentage change in base salary and annual bonus for all 
employees reflects a significant decrease in the number of 
employees at all levels in the organisation during the year.
Relative importance of the spend on pay
The table below illustrates the current year and prior year overall 
expenditure on pay. The regulations require that we report 
distributions received by Shareholders through dividends and share 
buy backs. It is currently the Company’s policy not to pay dividends. 
We did not buy back shares during 2015.

Remuneration paid to all employees represents total staff costs 
from continuing operations. The $31.1 million decrease in staff costs 
relates to a decrease in the number of employees (41% reduction 
during 2015).
Payments for loss of office
In 2015, there were no payments to directors for loss of office.
Statement of Directors’ shareholding and share interests
The beneficial interests of the Directors in the Company’s shares as at 31 December 2015 are shown in the table below. There have been  
no changes in the Directors’ shareholdings and interests since 31 December 2015.
The Company does not currently operate a formal shareholding guideline as Executive Directors must normally hold any vested shares 
under the PSP for three years following vesting and are expected to build up their holding over time.

Implementation of remuneration policy in 2016
This section provides an overview of how the Committee is 
proposing to implement our remuneration policy in 2016.
Base salary
In determining Executive Director salary increases for 2016, the 
Committee took into consideration a number of factors including:
• The individual’s skills and experience
• Business performance
• Salary levels for similar roles within the industry
• Pay and conditions elsewhere in the Company
The Committee has decided that no salary increase would be made 
for Murat Özgül in 2016. At the time of his appointment as CEO in 
July 2015 a salary increase was awarded commensurate to the 
change in his role. The table below shows base salaries for 2016.
Base
salary from
1 Jan 2016
Murat Özgül £625,000
Benefits
As outlined above, Murat Özgül receives a cash supplement in lieu  
of all benefits, including pension, private health insurance, life 
assurance and company car provision. The cash supplement is not 
included in calculating bonus and long-term incentive quantum.
For 2016, the cash supplement remains set at 25% of base salary. 
2016 Benefits

Murat Özgül £156,250
2016 – Annual bonus targets
The target bonus for Murat Ozgul for 2016 remains at 100% of base 
salary, with a maximum bonus of 150% of base salary.
For 2016, the performance of the Executive Director will be 
measured 70% against company metrics and 30% against 
individual performance. The metrics have been changed to place a 
greater emphasis in 2016 on operational and financial performance, 
55% of the company metric’s will relate to operational and financial 
performance compared to 40% in 2015.

Performance share plan
PSP awards are granted in the form of nil-cost options over shares  
in the Company with the number of options granted normally 
determined by reference to a percentage of base salary.
For 2016 awards, given the fall in share price in February 2016 
following announcement of the 2015 impairment charge, the 
Committee intends to review whether a normal award of 150%  
of salary is appropriate in the current circumstances.
The Committee continues to consider that relative TSR is the  
most appropriate measure to create maximum alignment with 
shareholders and encourage long-term value creation. The vesting 
of the PSP award will therefore continue to be determined based  
on the Company’s relative TSR against a sectoral peer group.  
The Committee has reviewed the TSR peer group and accordingly 
the peer group for the 2016 award will be as follows:
BP   Ophir Energy  
Cairn Energy Premier Oil 
DNO  Royal Dutch Shell 
Dragon Oil  Seplat Petroleum 
Enquest   SOCO International 
Gulf Keystone  Tullow Oil 
Nostrum Oil & Gas   
The vesting schedule will remain the same as for awards made  
in 2015, as outlined on page 59.
Clawback provisions
The Committee has considered clawback in the context of the Code 
and will apply clawback provisions to both the annual bonus and the 
PSP where it is considered appropriate. Such circumstances may 
include a material misstatement of the Company’s audited results, 
misconduct of the individual and any error in the calculation of any 
performance condition. Clawback may be applied up to one year 
after payment for bonus awards and three years after vesting for 
PSP awards. In compliance with the UK Corporate Governance Code, 
PSP awards are subject to malus provisions. Details of these 
provisions are set out in the policy report on page 65.
Chairman and Non-Executive Director remuneration
The fee policy for the Chairman and Non-Executive Directors 
remains unchanged in 2016.
Role Fee
Non-Executive Chairman £260,000
Senior Independent Director No additional fee
Non-Executive Director fee £80,000
Additional fee for membership of
two Board Committees £20,000
Additional fee for Committee chairmanship:

genelenergy.com REMUNERATION POLICY REPORT
This part of the report sets out a summary of the Directors’ remuneration policy as determined by the Remuneration Committee  
(“the Committee”) and approved by shareholders at the 2014 Annual General Meeting. A copy of the shareholder approved Policy  
is available at www.genelenergy.com in the Investors Relations section. 
The Company is incorporated in Jersey rather than the UK. Accordingly, the Company does not have the benefit of the statutory 
protections afforded by the UK Companies Act 2006 in the event that there were to be any inconsistency between this Policy and any 
contractual entitlement or other rights of a Director. Therefore, in the event that there were to be any payment which was inconsistent 
with this Policy, the Company would not have the statutory right, under section 226E of the UK Companies Act 2006, to recover such 
payments from its Directors.

Genel Energy plc Annual Report 2015
genelenergy.com Notes to the policy table
The Committee reserves the right to make any remuneration 
payments and payments for loss of office notwithstanding that they 
are not in line with the Policy set out above, where the terms of that 
payment were agreed:
• before the Policy came into effect; or
• at a time when the relevant individual was not a Director of  
the Company and, in the opinion of the Committee, the payment 
was not in consideration for the individual becoming a Director of 
the Company
For these purposes ‘payments’ includes the Committee satisfying 
awards of variable remuneration (including awards under any of the 
Company’s share plans) and, in relation to an award or option over 
shares, the terms are ‘agreed’ at the time the award is granted.
Performance measures and targets
Annual bonus
The annual bonus performance measures are designed to provide 
an appropriate balance between incentivising Executive Directors to 
meet financial targets for the year and to deliver specific strategic, 
operational and personal goals. This balance allows the Committee 
to review the Company’s performance in the round against the key 
elements of our strategy and appropriately incentivise and reward 
Executive Directors. 
Bonus targets are set by the Committee each year to ensure that 
Executive Directors are focused on the key objectives for the next  
12 months. In doing so, the Committee takes into account a number 
of internal and external reference points, including the Company’s 
business plan.
PSP
The ultimate goal of our strategy is to provide long-term sustainable 
returns to shareholders. The Committee currently considers that 
relative TSR is the most appropriate measure to assess the 
underlying financial performance of the business while creating 
maximum alignment with Shareholders and encouraging long-term 
value creation.
Malus provisions
Under the PSP and RSP, prior to vesting, the Committee may cancel 
or reduce the number of shares awarded or impose additional 
conditions on an award in circumstances where the Committee 
considers it to be appropriate. Such circumstances may include a 
material misstatement of the Company’s audited financial results, a 
material breach of health and safety regulations, a material failure of 
risk management or serious reputational damage to the Company.
The Committee has considered malus provisions in the context of 
the annual bonus and is satisfied that malus is appropriately taken 
into account at the time the Committee approves a bonus payment.
Plan rules
The PSP and RSP shall be operated in accordance with the rules of 
the plans as approved by Shareholders and amended from time to 
time in accordance with those rules. In particular:
• The plan rules provide for adjustments in certain circumstances, 
for example, awards may be adjusted in the event of variation of 
the Company’s share capital, demerger, special dividend, 
reorganisation or similar event;
• In the event of a change of control of the Company, existing share 
awards will vest in line with the plan rules to the extent the 
Committee determines, taking into account the extent to which 
any performance conditions (where applicable) have been satisfied 
and, unless the Committee determines otherwise, the time elapsed 
since that time. The Committee may, in the event of a winding-up 
of the Company, demerger, delisting, special dividend or other 
event which the Committee considers may affect the price of 
shares, allow awards to vest on the same basis;
• The performance conditions may be replaced or varied if an event 
occurs or circumstances arise which cause the Committee, acting 
fairly and reasonably, to determine that a substituted or amended 
performance condition would be more appropriate (taking into 
account the interests of the Shareholders of the Company) 
provided that the amended performance condition would not be 
materially less difficult to satisfy; and
• The Committee may elect, prior to vesting or exercise in the case 
of options, to deliver the value of vested awards as cash. 
Remuneration arrangements throughout the Company
The remuneration policy for Executive Directors is designed in line 
with the remuneration principles that underpin remuneration across 
the Company. When making decisions in respect of Executive 
Director remuneration arrangements, the Committee takes into 
consideration the pay and conditions for employees throughout the 
Company, including the local inflationary impact for the countries in 
which we operate. As stated in the policy table, salary increases are 
normally made with reference to the average increase for the wider 
employee population.
The Company places a significant focus on variable remuneration, 
ensuring that a meaningful proportion of remuneration across all 
employees is based on performance, through its operation of the 
annual bonus plan throughout the Company and participation in 
share incentive plans. 
Genel is committed to strengthening and widening employee share 
ownership by the use of share incentives granted under our share 
plans. As a result approximately 90% of employees participate in 
our share plans.
The Committee does not directly consult with our employees as part 
of the process of determining executive pay. However, there is wide 
employee participation in our share plans.

Genel Energy plc Annual Report 2015
genelenergy.com Non-Executive Directors may receive professional advice in respect 
of their duties with the Company which will be paid for by the 
Company. Non-Executive Directors will also be covered by the 
Company’s directors and officers insurance policy.
Recruitment policy
In determining remuneration for new appointments to the Board, 
the Committee will consider all relevant factors including, but not 
limited to, the calibre of the individual and their existing package, the 
external market and the existing arrangements for the Company’s 
current Executive Directors, with a view that any arrangements 
offered are in the best interests of the Company and shareholders 
and without paying any more than is necessary.
Where the new appointment is replacing a previous Executive 
Director, salaries and total remuneration opportunity may be higher 
or lower than the previous incumbent. If the appointee is expected 
to develop into the role, the Committee may decide to appoint the 
new Executive Director to the Board at a lower than typical salary. 
Larger increases (above those of the wider employee population) 
may be awarded over a period of time to move closer to market level 
as their experience develops.
Benefits will normally be limited to those outlined in the 
remuneration policy table above. However, additional benefits may 
be provided by the Company where the Committee considers it 
reasonable and necessary to do so. Such circumstances may include 
where an Executive Director is required to relocate in order to fulfil 
their duties. In such cases, a cash payment higher than the 25% of 
salary that is ordinarily paid would normally be provided under the 
Company’s standard expatriate policy in lieu of certain benefits, 
which may include the provision of a housing allowance, education 
support, health insurance, tax advice, a relocation or repatriation 
allowance and a home leave allowance.
It is expected that the structure and quantum of the variable pay 
elements would reflect those set out in the policy table above. 
However, the Committee recognises that, as an independent oil and 
gas company, it is competing with global firms for its talent. As a 
result, the Committee considers it important that the recruitment 
policy has sufficient flexibility in order to attract the calibre of 
individual that the Company requires to grow a successful business.
Therefore:
• Under the annual bonus, the Committee reserves the right to provide 
either a one-off or ongoing maximum bonus opportunity of up to 
200% of salary if this is required to secure an external appointment
• The Committee would also retain the discretion to flex the balance 
between annual and long-term incentives and the measures used 
to assess performance for these elements, whilst maintaining the 
intention that a significant portion of variable pay would be 
delivered in shares
• Variable pay could, in exceptional circumstances, be delivered via 
alternative structures, again with the intention that a significant 
portion would be share-based, but in all circumstances subject to 
an ongoing over-riding cap of 600% of salary. This cap excludes 
any awards made to compensate the director for incentive awards 
or any other remuneration arrangements forfeited from their 
previous employer (see below)
The above flexibility will only be used if the Committee believes such 
action is absolutely necessary to recruit and motivate a candidate 
from the global market. The Committee commits to explain to 
shareholders the rationale for the relevant arrangements following 
any appointment.
Where an Executive Director is appointed from within the Group,  
the normal policy of the Company is that any legacy arrangements 
would be honoured in line with the original terms and conditions. 
Similarly, if an Executive Director is appointed following an 
acquisition of or merger with another company, legacy terms and 
conditions would be honoured.
The Committee retains the discretion to make appropriate 
remuneration decisions outside the standard policy to meet the 
individual circumstances of the recruitment, when an interim 
appointment to fill an Executive Director role is made on a short-
term basis or a Non-Executive Director or the Chairman takes on an 
executive function on a short-term basis.
Buy-outs
In order to facilitate recruitment, the Committee may make a one-off 
award to ‘buy-out’ incentive awards and any other compensation 
arrangements that a new hire has had to forfeit on leaving their 
previous employer. In doing so, the Committee will take into account 
all relevant factors including any performance conditions attached to 
the forfeited awards, the likelihood of those conditions being met, the 
proportion of the vesting/performance period remaining and the form 
of the award (e.g. cash or shares). Where possible, the forfeited 
awards will normally be bought out on an estimated like-for-like basis.
The Committee is at all times conscious of the need to pay no more 
than is necessary, particularly when determining any possible 
buy-out arrangements.

Recruitment of Chairman and Non-Executive Directors
In the event of the appointment of a new Chairman and/or  
Non-Executive Director, remuneration arrangements will normally 
be in line with those detailed in the relevant table above. The  
service contract of an Executive Director may also be terminated 
immediately and with no liability to make payment in certain 
circumstances, such as the Executive Director bringing the  
Group into disrepute or committing a fundamental breach of  
their employment obligations.
Unless otherwise approved, an Executive Director may accept  
only one position as a Non-Executive Director (but not as a  
Non-Executive Chairman) of a FTSE 100 company that is not a 
competitor of the Company, subject to prior notification to the 
Chairman of the Company and the approval of the Board or  
duly authorised Committee thereof.
Policy on payment for loss of office
In the event that the employment of an Executive Director is 
terminated, any compensation payable will be determined in 
accordance with the terms of the service contract between the 
Company and the employee, as well as the rules of any incentive plans.
The Company considers a variety of factors when considering 
leaving arrangements for an Executive Director, including  
individual and business performance, the obligation for the  
Director to mitigate loss (for example by gaining new employment) 
and other relevant circumstances (e.g. ill health).
If the Executive Director’s employment is terminated by the 
Company, the Executive Director may receive a time pro-rated 
bonus, subject to remuneration committee discretion. 
The treatment of outstanding share awards is governed by the 
relevant share plan rules. The following table summarises the  
leaver provisions of share plans under which Executive Directors 
may currently hold awards.

• Awards will vest to the extent determined by the 
Committee taking into account the achievement of any 
performance conditions at the relevant vesting date 
and, unless the Committee determines otherwise, the 
period of time which has elapsed between grant and 
cessation of employment
• The vesting date for such awards will normally be the 
original vesting date, although the Committee has the 
flexibility to determine that awards can vest upon 
cessation of employment 
• In the event of death, all unvested awards will normally 
vest at that time to the extent determined by the 
Committee taking into account the achievement of any 
relevant performance conditions as at the date of death 
and, unless the Committee determines otherwise, the

• Upon termination by the Company, an Executive Director has a duty to mitigate, and use reasonable endeavours to secure 
alternative employment as soon as reasonably practicable. In Murat Özgül’s service contract, there are specific provisions 
requiring a reduction in any phased PILON payments in the event that he finds alternative employment

genelenergy.com OTHER STATUTORY AND REGULATORY INFORMATION
Principal activities
The Company is the holding company for the Group. The Group  
is principally engaged in the business of oil and gas exploration  
and production.
Results and dividends
Ordinary activities after taxation of the Group for the period  
1 January 2015 to 31 December 2015 amounted to a loss of  
$1,161.6 million. No interim dividend was paid and the Directors  
are not recommending a final dividend for the period ended  
31 December 2015.
Subsequent events
There have been no subsequent events since 31 December 2015.
Share capital
As at 2 March 2016, the Company had allotted and fully paid up 
share capital of 280,248,198 ordinary shares of 10 pence each with 
an aggregate nominal value of £28,024,819.80. 1,865,720 shares 
are held as treasury shares.
Founder securities
Prior to admission, the Founders (including Nathaniel Rothschild, 
Tony Hayward and Julian Metherell) were issued C shares in Vallares 
Holding Company Limited (since renamed Genel Energy Holding 
Company Limited), known as founder securities.
These founder securities were put in place to encourage the 
Founders to grow the Company following an acquisition in order  
to maximise value for holders of ordinary shares by entitling the 
Founders to a share of the upside in the Company’s value once 
certain performance has been achieved. The exchange of founder 
securities for ordinary shares was subject to certain performance 
conditions which were required to be met by 21 November 2015.
These performance conditions were not met by this date and 
accordingly the right to exchange founder securities for ordinary 
shares in Genel Energy plc has now lapsed.
Resolutions in relation to share capital
At the AGM of the Company held on 21 April 2015, the Shareholders 
granted the Company authority to make market purchases of up to 
24,870,080 voting ordinary shares (representing approximately 
10% of the aggregate issued voting ordinary share capital of the 
Company at 17 March 2015) and hold as treasury shares any voting 
ordinary shares so purchased.
Shareholders will be asked to renew this authority at the 
forthcoming AGM. Full details are included in the notice of AGM.
The right of Founders to exchange founder securities for ordinary 
shares in the Company lapsed on 21 November 2015. Accordingly, 
authorities granted on 16 June 2011 for: (a) the allotment of relevant 
securities; and (b) the disapplication of pre-emption rights for the 
purposes of the allotment of equity securities, for the purposes of  
or in connection with: (i) satisfying the share matching award; or  
(ii) satisfying the rights of Founders to exchange founder shares  
and founder securities for ordinary shares, have now lapsed and  
will not be renewed.
Rights attaching to the voting ordinary shares
Holders of voting ordinary shares are entitled to attend, speak and 
vote at general meetings of the Company and may receive a dividend 
and, on a winding-up, may share in the assets of the Company.
As at 24 February 2016 the Company no longer has any suspended 
voting ordinary shares in issue, however they were in issue during 
2015 and accordingly the rights attaching to the suspended voting 
ordinary shares are set out below. 
Except as set out below, the suspended voting ordinary shares rank 
pari passu with the voting ordinary shares (and any other suspended 
voting ordinary shares issued on substantially equivalent terms to 
the suspended voting ordinary shares) in all respects and no action 
may be taken by the Company in relation to, or offer made by the 
Company to the holders of, the voting ordinary shares (or any other 
suspended voting ordinary shares issued on substantially equivalent 
terms to the suspended voting ordinary shares) unless the same 
action is taken in respect of, or the same offer is made to the holders 
of, the suspended voting ordinary shares.
On the 23 October 2015 the Code Committee of the Takeover Panel 
punlished its response statement followng the consultation on PCP 
2015/2 in relation to restrictions and suspensions of voting rights 
(‘RS 2015/2’).
As stated in RS 2015/2, with effect from 23 November 2015 the 
definition of ‘Voting Rights’ in the Takeover Code will change, so that 
any shares which are subject to a suspension of voting rights will 
normally be regarded as having voting rights which are currently 
exercisable at a general meeting.
Paragraph 1.8 of RS 2015/2 provides that companies that have in the 
past issued suspended voting shares, which remain in issue, should 
consult with the Panel Executive in order to obtain a ruling regarding 
the application of the Takeover Code to the Company, taking 
account of the facts of the particular case.
The Company had 29,621,685 existing suspended voting shares in 
issue and it had consulted with the Panel Executive in accordance 
with paragraph 1.8 of RS 2015/2.
The Panel Executive has confirmed to the Company that its 
suspended voting shares would not be treated as having ‘Voting 
Rights’ for the purposes of the Takeover Code.
The following rights attach to the suspended voting ordinary  
shares as set out in a statement of rights submitted to the Jersey 
Financial Services Commission by the Company on 8 April 2013  
(the ‘Statement of Rights’).

or any person acting in concert with a Seller or any of its 
Affiliates, to wind up the Company or to present a petition to wind 
up the Company, other than for the purposes of a reconstruction 
or amalgamation whilst solvent;
(ii)  proposed by any person other than a Seller or any of its Affiliates 
or any person acting in concert with a Seller or any of its

or to approve any arrangement with the Company’s creditors;
(iii)  proposed by the board for the purposes of, or in connection with, 
any scheme of arrangement of the Company under the Jersey 
Companies Law (or its equivalent in any other jurisdiction) under 
which a body corporate (Newco) will acquire the Company and 
the holdings of the members of Newco following the scheme 
becoming effective will be substantially the same as the holdings 
of the members of the Company immediately before the scheme 
becoming effective; or

suspended voting ordinary shares, in which case each holder of 
suspended voting ordinary shares on a show of hands shall have 
one vote, and on a poll shall be entitled to vote on the resolution 
on the basis of one vote for each suspended voting ordinary 
share held. For the purposes of any resolution of a type referred

voting ordinary shares issued on substantially equivalent terms 
to the suspended voting ordinary shares) and no separate 
meeting or resolution of the holders of the suspended voting 
ordinary shares shall be required to be convened or passed.
The rights attaching to the suspended voting ordinary shares  
shall not be, and shall not be deemed to be, varied or abrogated in 
any way by the creation, allotment or issue of any voting ordinary 
shares and the rights attaching to the voting ordinary shares shall 
not be,  and shall not be deemed to be, varied or abrogated in any 
way by the creation, allotment or issue of any suspended voting

such suspended voting ordinary shares shall convert into voting  
ordinary shares (on a one-for-one basis) automatically upon,  
and contemporaneously with, registration by the Company (or its 
registrars) of the transfer in the register of members of the Company.
Upon:
(i)  a transfer of voting ordinary shares to a person who is not a Seller 
or an Affiliate of any Seller as a result of which the Seller’s Voting 
Shareholding is reduced below the Maximum Voting Percentage; 
or
(ii)  any issue of further shares by the Company or conversion of 
suspended voting ordinary shares as referred to below, as a 
result of which the Sellers’ Voting Shareholding is reduced below 
the Maximum Voting Percentage,
such number of suspended voting ordinary shares as, immediately 
following conversion, will result in the Sellers’ Voting Shareholding 
being equal to the Maximum Voting Percentage, shall convert into 
voting ordinary shares (on a one-for-one basis) automatically upon, 
and contemporaneously with, registration by the Company (or  
its registrars) of the transfer in the register of members of the 
Company or the issue of such further shares or conversion of such 
suspended voting ordinary shares. In any such case, each Seller and 
its Affiliates’ holding of suspended voting ordinary shares (whether 
held directly or on their behalf by an escrow agent) at the time of 
such transfer, issue or conversion shall be subject to conversion  
into voting ordinary shares in accordance with a written notice of 
instructions as to the proportion of the suspended voting ordinary 
shares held by each of them (including by an escrow agent on their 
behalf) to be converted. Such notice shall be executed by each Seller 
(or such nominee of a Seller as the relevant Seller may notify the 
Company in writing from time to time) and must be received by the 
Company at its registered address not less than five business days 
before registration by the Company (or its registrar) of the transfer 
in the register of members of the Company or the issue of such 
further shares or conversion of such suspended voting ordinary 
shares (the “Conversion Notice”) (in each case rounded up or down 
to the nearest whole number as determined by any Director of the 
Company in his absolute discretion). The Company shall be under  
no obligation to verify the validity of any Conversion Notice  
(or notification of nominees) or the authority and capacity of the 
relevant signatory.
(c) Conversion at the instance of a Seller (or any Affiliate)
At any time, a Seller (or any of its Affiliates) shall be entitled (but 
shall not be bound) to require the Company to convert suspended 
voting ordinary shares held by such Seller (or such Affiliate) into 
voting ordinary shares, on a one-for-one basis, so long as such 
conversion does not result in the Sellers’ Voting Shareholding being 
more than the Maximum Voting Percentage.
(d) Conversion following a pre-emptive offer
If the Company makes an offer of suspended voting ordinary shares 
in accordance with the provisions of the articles of association,  
it shall be entitled to convert into voting ordinary shares, on a one 
for-one basis, any suspended voting ordinary shares issued to 
persons other than the Sellers or any of their respective Affiliates  
in connection with such offer.
Within 21 days after the conversion of any suspended voting 
ordinary shares into voting ordinary shares, the Company shall 
forward to the relevant Seller (or relevant Affiliate) at its own risk, 
free of charge, a definitive certificate for the appropriate number  
of fully paid up voting ordinary shares and a new certificate for any 
unconverted suspended voting ordinary shares comprised in the 
certificate surrendered by it. Pending the despatch of definitive 
certificates, transfers shall be certified against the register of 
members of the Company.

ordinary shares arising on conversion of the suspended voting 
ordinary shares are admitted to the Official List and to trading

suspended voting ordinary shares whilst they remain suspended 
voting ordinary shares.

Articles of association of the Company
Under the Jersey Companies Law, the capacity of a Jersey company 
is not limited by anything contained in its memorandum or articles 
of association. Accordingly, the memorandum of association of  
a Jersey company does not contain an objects clause.
Certain provisions have been incorporated into the articles  
of association to enshrine rights that are not conferred by  
the Jersey Companies Law, but which the Company believes 
shareholders would expect to see in a company listed on the  
London Stock Exchange.
Provisions in the articles of association also require Shareholders  
to make disclosures pursuant to chapter 5 of the Disclosure and 
Transparency Rules, and require the Directors to comply with 
chapter 3 of the Disclosure and Transparency Rules and themselves 
to require any persons discharging managerial responsibilities 
(within the meaning ascribed in the Disclosure and Transparency 
Rules) in relation to the Company who are not Directors to do so, 
and to use reasonable endeavours to procure that their own and 
such persons’ connected persons do so. The articles of association 
may be amended by a special resolution of the Shareholders.
Appointment and replacement of directors
The rules for the appointment and replacement of Directors are  
set out in the articles of association. Certain additional provisions 
relating to the appointment of Directors are included in the 
Relationship Agreement between the Company, Elysion and  
Focus Investments.
Directors
The biographical details of the Directors of the Company who were 
in office during the year and as at the date of this annual report are

Details of the Directors’ interests in the ordinary shares of the 
Company and in the Group’s long-term incentive schemes are set 
out in the remuneration report on page 61 of this annual report. 
Details of Directors submitting themselves for election and

of the Company.
Directors’ indemnities

liability insurance cover, the level of which is reviewed annually.
Related party transactions

Agreements with substantial shareholders
Merger Agreement
On 7 September 2011, the Company, Elysion Energy Holding B.V. 
(formerly Genel Energy Holdings B.V.), Focus Investments and PRM 
entered into a merger agreement (the “Merger Agreement”) 
pursuant to which the Company agreed to purchase, and the  
Sellers agreed to sell, the entire issued ordinary share capital of 
Genel Energy International Limited in consideration for the issue  
of 130,632,522 ordinary shares (the “Consideration Shares”).  
The Merger Agreement was amended by a deed of amendment 
entered into on 29 October 2011.
Due to the size of the interest the Sellers have in the Company 
following completion, the Sellers agreed that part of the 
consideration they received under the Merger Agreement would be 
in the form of suspended voting ordinary shares in order to ensure 
that the Sellers’ aggregate holding of voting ordinary shares does  
not exceed the Maximum Voting Percentage. The suspended voting 
ordinary shares will automatically convert into voting ordinary 
shares in the event of further equity issues by the Company, 
provided that, following conversion, the Sellers’ holding of voting 
ordinary shares does not exceed the Maximum Voting Percentage.
Notwithstanding any other restriction or obligation under the 
Merger Agreement, PRM was permitted to distribute all ordinary 
shares owned by it to its shareholders in proportion to the shares in 
PRM held by such shareholders, which it duly made on 8 April 2013. 
In connection with this distribution, the relevant PRM shareholders 
agreed to be bound by the terms of the Merger Agreement.
Relationship Agreement
On 7 September 2011, the Company, Elysion and Focus Investments 
entered into a relationship agreement which regulates the ongoing 
relationship between Elysion, Focus Investments and the Company 
(the ‘Relationship Agreement’).
The principal purpose of the Relationship Agreement is to ensure 
that the Company is capable at all times of carrying on its business 
independently of Elysion and Focus Investments (and their 
respective Associates) and that all transactions and relationships 
between the Company, Elysion and Focus Investments are at arm’s 
length and on a normal commercial basis. For the purposes of the 
Relationship Agreement, the term ‘Associate’ includes, in the case  
of Elysion, Mehmet Sepil and, in the case of Focus Investments, 
Mehmet Emin Karamehmet.
On 12 February 2015 the Relationship Agreement was amended  
to reflect changes to the Listing Rules that apply to controlling 
shareholders. Whilst the Relationship Agreement reflected the 
majority of the requirements we felt it prudent to amend it to align  
it to the specific obligations under Listing Rule 6.1.4(d).
The Relationship Agreement will terminate upon the earlier of (i)  
the Company ceasing to have any of its ordinary shares listed on the 
Official List and admitted to trading on the London Stock Exchange’s 
main market for listed securities, and (ii) Elysion and Focus 
Investments together with their respective Associates ceasing 
between them to be entitled to exercise, or control the exercise of,  
in aggregate 10% or more of the Voting Rights.

amendment to the articles of association of the company 
which would be inconsistent with or breach any provision

or Focus Investments or any of their Associates as the

and Transparency Rules, the requirements of the London

Associates are, between them, entitled to exercise or control the 
exercise of, in aggregate, 10% or more of the Voting Rights, each

of its Associates will:
i. conduct all transactions and arrangements with any 
member of the Group on arm’s length and on normal 
commercial terms;
ii. not take any action that would have the effect of preventing 
the Company from complying with its obligations under the 
Listing Rules; and

resolution which is intended or appears to be intended to 
circumvent the proper application of the Listing Rules;
(c)  Provided that Focus Investments and its Associates are entitled

Rights, Focus Investments shall be entitled to nominate for

the Company;
(d)  Provided that Elysion and its Associates are entitled to exercise 
or control the exercise of 10% or more of the Voting Rights, 
Elysion shall be entitled to nominate for appointment to the 
Board one director by giving notice to the Company;
(e)  For as long as Elysion and Focus Investments and their respective 
Associates are between them entitled to exercise or control  
the exercise of 10% or more of the Voting Rights, but provided

with its Associates) is entitled to exercise or control the exercise

Elysion and Focus Investments are provided with financial and 
other information as is necessary or reasonably required by  
them for the purposes of their accounting or financial control 
requirements or to comply with their legal or tax obligations  
as a shareholder of the Company.
The rights described at (b)–(g) above will terminate and cease to be 
of any effect:

defined in the Merger Agreement) of Elysion that holds any 
ordinary shares) ceases to be controlled by Mehmet Sepil; or
ii. in the case of Focus Investments, in the event that Focus 
Investments (or any Affiliate (as defined in the Merger 
Agreement) of Focus Investments that holds any ordinary 
shares) ceases to be controlled by Mehmet Emin 
Karamehmet.
In addition, certain rights and/or obligations (as the case may be)  
of Elysion under the Relationship Agreement (subject to certain 
exceptions) shall cease to be of any effect in the event that Mehmet 
Sepil ceases to beneficially own (directly or indirectly through other 
entities controlled by Mehmet Sepil) ordinary shares carrying,  
in aggregate, 10% or more of the Voting Rights.

INDEPENDENT AUDITORS’ REPORT TO THE MEMBERS  
OF GENEL ENERGY PLC
REPORT ON THE GROUP FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Our opinion
In our opinion, Genel Energy plc’s group financial statements (the “financial statements”):
• give a true and fair view of the state of the group’s affairs as at 31 December 2015 and of its loss and cash flows for the year then ended;
• have been properly prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (“IFRSs”) as adopted by the European Union; 
and
• have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies (Jersey) Law 1991.
What we have audited
The financial statements, included within the Annual Report, comprise:
• the consolidated balance sheet as at 31 December 2015;
• the consolidated statement of comprehensive income for the year then ended;
• the consolidated cash flow statement for the year then ended;
• the consolidated statement of changes in equity for the year then ended; and
• the notes to the financial statements, which include a summary of significant accounting policies and other explanatory information.
The financial reporting framework that has been applied in the preparation of the financial statements is applicable law and IFRSs as 
adopted by the European Union.
Overview
•   Overall group materiality: $5 million which represents 1% of total assets.
• We performed an audit of the complete financial information of two reporting units  
due to their size and risk characteristics. These reporting units are the producing assets  
in Kurdistan.
•  Specific audit procedures on certain balances and transactions were performed on 10 
other reporting units, relating to exploration activity in the African territories, operating 
expenses and the bond accounting in the UK.
• Risk of impairment of oil and gas properties.
• Risk of recoverability of debtors.
• PSC revenue recognition and interpretation
The scope of our audit and our areas of focus
We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland) (“ISAs (UK & Ireland)”).
We designed our audit by determining materiality and assessing the risks of material misstatement in the financial statements. In 
particular, we looked at where the directors made subjective judgements, for example in respect of significant accounting estimates  
that involved making assumptions and considering future events that are inherently uncertain. As in all of our audits we also addressed 
the risk of management override of internal controls, including evaluating whether there was evidence of bias by the directors that 
represented a risk of material misstatement due to fraud. 
The risks of material misstatement that had the greatest effect on our audit, including the allocation of our resources and effort, are 
identified as “areas of focus” in the table below. We have also set out how we tailored our audit to address these specific areas in order  
to provide an opinion on the financial statements as a whole, and any comments we make on the results of our procedures should be 
read in this context. This is not a complete list of all risks identified by our audit.

Genel Energy plc Annual Report 2015
genelenergy.com IFRS 6 and IAS 36 impairment reviews of oil and gas properties 
(Note 9 and Note 10)
In 2015, world oil prices continued to decline significantly with  
the performance of the Company’s producing assets being  
below expectation, partly caused by lack of investment. Both  
are indicators of potential impairment in the company’s assets.
Management performed an impairment assessment of each of its 
assets in accordance with the requirements of IFRS 6 – Exploration 
for and evaluation of mineral resources (“IFRS 6”) and IAS 36 – 
Impairment of assets (“IAS 36”) as at 31 December 2015.
A number of exploration assets in Africa and Kurdistan were either 
relinquished or no hydrocarbons were encountered during test well 
drilling in 2015. Full write offs totalling $3 million were recorded in 
the income statement relating to these exploration assets. 
The oil producing assets, Taq Taq and Tawke, were assessed for 
impairment by management and a charge of US$,038 million was 
recorded in accordance with IAS 36 reflecting the fall in oil prices 
and a reduction in 2P reserves in the Taq Taq oil field.
We assessed management’s evaluation of each of the exploration 
assets in both the Africa and Kurdistan portfolios and corroborated 
this evaluation by making enquiries of management and reading 
information in the public domain such as press releases from joint 
venture partners. 
Based on our assessment, we agreed with management on the 
impairment triggers and resulting impairment charges recorded 
against the Ethiopia concession, Mir Left in Morocco and the 
concession in Côte d’Ivoire. We also agreed with the full write off  
of Ber Bahr in Kurdistan after the decision to relinquish the licence.
For the Miran/Bina Bawi exploration and evaluation assets we 
evaluated management’s plans for the business, the underlying 
resource model and management’s estimate of the associated costs 
and volumes of gas available for development by agreeing these 
assumptions to the competent person’s reports and assessing the 
competent persons’ qualifications, experience and independence to 
determine whether there were any impairment indicators. We also 
assessed management’s pricing assumptions by referencing them to 
consensus broker prices. We agreed with management’s assessment 
that there are no significant indicators of impairment and that 
therefore no impairment assessment was required.
We evaluated management’s assessment for impairment triggers in 
its producing assets in Kurdistan and agreed with management that 
impairment triggers exist.
For both Taq Taq and Tawke we agreed the cash flow forecast used  
in the impairment models for 2016 to Board approved budgets. These 
budgets were also approved by both the joint venture partners and 
the Kurdistan Regional Government (“KRG”). We agreed the cash  
flow forecast for periods after 2016 to management’s business plans 
which are based on management’s update of the reserves. For Taq 
Taq, 2P reserves have been downgraded since the last year-end.  
We checked that the oil reserve estimates incorporated in the model 
were consistent with the estimates prepared by qualified reservoir 
engineers. We considered the directors’ expectations in respect of 
cash receipts from the KRG from the sale of oil in Taq Taq and Tawke 
under the terms of the production sharing contracts and the recent 
announcement made by the KRG on 1 February 2016 and consider  
the assumptions to be aligned with this 2016 announcement. 
We compared short and long term price assumptions used by 
management to the assumptions used by a collection of 13 brokers 
and 5 independent consultants. We found that management’s 
assumptions were close to consensus prices.
We independently calculated a weighted average cost of capital by 
making reference to market data and verified the long term growth 
rate market data. The discount rate of 12.5% falls within what we 
considered a reasonable range.
We assessed the mathematical accuracy of the model and assessed 
the compliance of the model with the requirements of IAS 36.
We assessed the sufficiency of the impairment charge and the  
extent of disclosure made in note 10 of the financial statements.  
We considered the impairment charges and the disclosure provided  
to be appropriate.

Genel Energy plc Annual Report 2015
genelenergy.com INDEPENDENT AUDITORS’ REPORT TO THE MEMBERS  
OF GENEL ENERGY PLC
Risk of recoverability of trade receivable (Note 1 and Note 11)
The trade receivable has increased to $423 million from $233 
million since December 2014. 
Cash receipts totalling approximately $74 million were received for 
export sales in September 2015, October 2015 and December 2015. 
In January 2016 a payment of $4 million was received and on  
1 February 2016, the Ministry of Natural Resources of the KRG 
released an announcement explaining that 2016 payments would  
be based on the entitlement revenue derived from each field on a 
netback basis, adjusting for crude quality differentials compared to 
Brent prices plus a deduction for applicable transportation charges. 
The amount is based on the contractual entitlements under the 
Production Sharing Contract for each licence. In addition, the KRG 
will make further monthly payments equivalent to 5% of the 
respective monthly netback revenue derived from each field. 
The KRG envisages raising the allocation of netback revenues as  
oil price levels rebound to permit an accelerated recovery of 
outstanding receivable balances. 
The timing of the recovery of the trade receivable at 31 December 
2015 is uncertain and there is a risk that it is impaired.
Management has made significant judgements and estimates  
in calculating the present value of the receivable. The principal 
judgement is in estimating the timing and quantum of the acceleration 
of payments by the KRG to international oil companies which is driven 
by the pace of recovery of oil prices, the KRG’s financial budget,  
the ability of the KRG to raise finance, and oil production within the 
Kurdistan Region of Iraq (“KRI”) as a whole which management has 
disclosed in note 1 of the accounts. Management has used information 
available in the market, has relied on dialogue with the Minister for 
Natural Resources and estimated when oil prices are going to recover 
in forecasting the timing of the recovery of the outstanding trade 
receivable balance. This is estimated between two and four years 
from the balance sheet date. The impact of discounting is offset 
principally by management including full PSC entitlements in the 
present value calculation whereas the receivable itself is recognised 
on the balance sheet after deducting netback costs (principally selling, 
transportation and handling costs) at the higher end of a likely range.
PSC revenue recognition and interpretation (Note 1)
The Production Sharing Contracts (“PSCs”) to which the  
Group is party are complex in nature and subject to potential 
alternative interpretation.
The terms of the PSCs dictate the amount of revenue recognised by 
the Group. The Group maintains a revenue model which is developed 
from the terms in the PSCs. The main inputs into this model are 
volumes, price and capital expenditure. Certain assumptions and 
estimates are made within the PSC model. There is an inherent risk 
that these inputs, assumptions and estimates are inaccurate and 
that the interpretations and calculations made are not appropriate.
This complexity of the PSCs and alternative interpretations could 
result in misstatements in various balances (revenue, cost of sales, 
property plant and equipment, trade and other receivables, trade 
and other payables and income taxes) in the financial statements.
We reconciled the opening trade receivable balance to the closing trade 
receivable balance by testing revenue (as described in our area of focus, 
‘PSC revenue recognition and interpretation’) and vouching cash 
receipts in 2015 to bank statements. No misstatements were noted.
We assessed management’s review of the recoverability of the 
receivable and note that a number of significant assumptions were 
made in concluding that the trade receivable is recoverable and is  
not impaired. 
Based on the recent payment profile by the KRG and the 1 February 
2016 announcement we agreed with management that the trade 
receivable is recoverable and is not materially impaired. There is  
also uncertainty in the pace of recovery of the debtor and we agreed 
that the judgements made by management are significant and that 
appropriate disclosure has been made in note 1 and note 17 to the 
financial statements. We evaluated management’s judgements  
and estimates by agreeing the KRG’s production targets to those 
reported publicly, future oil prices to broker consensus data that we 
independently verified, KRG cash costs to publicly available 
information and checked that the assumptions used in the recovery  
of the trade receivable were consistent with the assumptions used  
in the impairment discounted cash flow models.
We also assessed the classification of the trade receivable between 
current and non-current and checked that the current portion 
represents amounts already received in 2016 that relate to the  
31 December 2015 receivable and amounts forecasted for the 
remainder of 2016 under the 1 February 2016 payment mechanism 
(being Genel’s share of 5% of the respective netback revenue  
derived for each field). 
AREA OF FOCUS
 
HOW OUR AUDIT ADDRESSED THE AREA OF FOCUS
 
We designed our procedures to test that the revenue recorded is  
in accordance with the PSCs and tested the calculations in the PSC 
model. We tested the capital expenditure by agreeing a sample of 
transactions to third party evidence. We tested the volumes sold  
and prices as follows:
 —Volume of oil sold – for a sample of domestic and export sales, 
we agreed the internal daily production reports to third party 
signed volume reports and third party signed loading 
documents. Our testing did not identify any material 
misstatements.
 —Pricing of oil sold – for a sample of domestic sales, we agreed 
the price recognised to KRG ministerial pricing orders. For 
export sales, we assessed the pricing assumptions made  
by management. We compared the pricing estimates to  
the historical pricing information provided by third parties  
and to industry and market data available. We found that 
management’s estimates fell within a reasonable range 
indicated by this data, noting that an element of contingency  
in the pricing reflects the uncertainty in the amount that  
is expected to be received in cash. 
78
Genel Energy plc Annual Report 2015
genelenergy.com Management continued to account for export sales on an accruals 
basis in 2015. The key pricing assumptions on transportation and 
other netback costs are based on management estimates owing  
to the absence of formal pricing agreements with the KRG. 
Management has reassessed accrual accounting for export sales 
and continues to be able to estimate revenue earned and has 
confidence that cash receipts on export and Bazian refinery  
sales from the KRG will continue. 
AREA OF FOCUS
 
HOW OUR AUDIT ADDRESSED THE AREA OF FOCUS
We reconciled the financial statements to the revenue calculated in 
the PSC models. We did not identify any material misstatements.
We checked the disclosure provided by management in note 1, 
significant estimates and judgements. We agreed with management 
that the pricing assumption is a significant judgement that leads to 
an estimate in the amount of revenue recorded. 
How we tailored the audit scope
We tailored the scope of our audit to ensure that we performed enough work to be able to give an opinion on the financial statements as  
a whole, taking into account the geographic structure of the group, the accounting processes and controls, and the industry in which the 
group operates. 
The group is structured along two business segments being the geographic areas in which it operates: Kurdistan and Africa. The group 
financial statements are a consolidation of reporting units, comprising the Group’s operating businesses in these segments  
and centralised functions.
In establishing the overall approach to the Group audit, we determined the type of work that needed to be performed at the reporting units 
to be able to conclude whether sufficient appropriate audit evidence had been obtained as a basis for our opinion on the Group financial 
statements as a whole.
We performed an audit of the complete financial information of two reporting units. Because of its size, the majority of our audit work was 
performed on one of these – the main trading entity for Kurdistan assets. The other reporting unit relates to the gas assets, Miran and Bina 
Bawi. We also performed specified procedures on certain account balances within the other reporting units, including the audit of the 
following items: exploration expenses within the entities that hold the Africa exploration licences, operating expenses and related payables 
within the UK and Ankara companies, and cash and cash equivalents and the bond in the UK.
Materiality
The scope of our audit was influenced by our application of materiality. We set certain quantitative thresholds for materiality. These, 
together with qualitative considerations, helped us to determine the scope of our audit and the nature, timing and extent of our audit 
procedures on the individual financial statement line items and disclosures and in evaluating the effect of misstatements, both individually 
and on the financial statements as a whole. 
Based on our professional judgement, we determined materiality for the financial statements as a whole as follows:
Overall group materiality $5 million (2014: $45 million).
How we determined it 1% of total assets.
Rationale for benchmark applied In 2015, we calculated materiality using a total assets benchmark and applied a ‘rule of thumb’ of 1%.  
We benchmarked our materiality level against published materiality thresholds used by auditors of  
other mid-size exploration and production companies and noted that the materiality level we selected  
is consistent with those benchmarked. 
We considered using an income statement benchmark in determining materiality; however, as a significant 
portion of the value of the Company is locked up in exploration/development oil and gas assets, we believe  
an asset measure remains more relevant. When the Company begins production on its significant oil and  
gas exploration/development assets, we will revisit our determination of materiality. 
We applied a lower specific materiality of $ million (2014: $10 million) for the following areas: Revenue,  
Cost of Sales, Exploration Expense, Operating Expense and Interest Expense. 
Additionally we applied a threshold of $.5 million on the Remuneration Report and related party transactions.
We agreed with the Audit Committee that we would report to them misstatements identified during our audit above $.75 million  
(2014: $.5 million) as well as misstatements below that amount that, in our view, warranted reporting for qualitative reasons.
Going concern
The directors have voluntarily complied with Listing Rule 9.8.6(R)(3)(a) of the Financial Conduct Authority and provided a statement  
in relation to going concern, set out on page 75, required for companies with a premium listing on the London Stock Exchange.

As noted in the directors’ statement, the directors have concluded that it is appropriate to adopt the going concern basis in preparing  
the financial statements. The going concern basis presumes that the group has adequate resources to remain in operation, and that the 
directors intend it to do so, for at least one year from the date the financial statements were signed. As part of our audit we have concluded 
that the directors’ use of the going concern basis is appropriate. However, because not all future events or conditions can be predicted, 
these statements are not a guarantee as to the group’s ability to continue as a going concern.

Responsibilities for the financial statements and the audit
Our responsibilities and those of the directors
As explained more fully in the Directors’ Responsibilities Statement set out on page 75, the directors are responsible for the preparation  
of the financial statements and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view.
Our responsibility is to audit and express an opinion on the financial statements in accordance with applicable law and ISAs (UK & Ireland). 
Those standards require us to comply with the Auditing Practices Board’s Ethical Standards for Auditors.
This report, including the opinions, has been prepared for and only for the company’s members as a body in accordance with Article 113A  
of the Companies (Jersey) Law 1991 and for no other purpose. We do not, in giving these opinions, accept or assume responsibility for any 
other purpose or to any other person to whom this report is shown or into whose hands it may come save where expressly agreed by our 
prior consent in writing.
What an audit of financial statements involves
An audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements sufficient to give reasonable assurance 
that the financial statements are free from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or error. This includes an assessment of: 
• whether the accounting policies are appropriate to the group’s circumstances and have been consistently applied and adequately 
disclosed; 
• the reasonableness of significant accounting estimates made by the directors; and 
• the overall presentation of the financial statements. 
We primarily focus our work in these areas by assessing the directors’ judgements against available evidence, forming our own judgements, 
and evaluating the disclosures in the financial statements.
We test and examine information, using sampling and other auditing techniques, to the extent we consider necessary to provide a 
reasonable basis for us to draw conclusions. We obtain audit evidence through testing the effectiveness of controls, substantive procedures 
or a combination of both. 
In addition, we read all the financial and non-financial information in the Annual Report to identify material inconsistencies with the audited 
financial statements and to identify any information that is apparently materially incorrect based on, or materially inconsistent with,  
the knowledge acquired by us in the course of performing the audit. If we become aware of any apparent material misstatements or 
inconsistencies we consider the implications for our report.

Genel Energy plc Annual Report 2015
genelenergy.com NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
1. Summary of significant accounting policies
Basis of preparation
The consolidated financial statements of Genel Energy Plc (the 
Company or the Group) have been prepared in accordance with 
International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the 
European Union (IFRS) and interpretations issued by the IFRS 
Interpretations Committee (IFRIC) are prepared under the historical 
cost convention and comply with Jersey company law. The 
significant accounting policies are set out below and have been 
consistently applied throughout the period.
Items included in the financial information of each of the Company‘s 
entities are measured using the currency of the primary economic 
environment in which the entity operates (the functional currency). 
The consolidated financial statements are presented in US dollars to 
the nearest million ($m) rounded to one decimal place, except where 
otherwise indicated.
For explanation of the key judgements and estimates made by 
management in applying the Company’s accounting policies, refer to 
significant accounting estimates and judgement on pages 86 to 88.
Going concern
At the time of approving the consolidated financial statements,  
the directors have a reasonable expectation that the Company  
has adequate resources to continue in operational existence for  
the foreseeable future and therefore its consolidated financial 
statements have been prepared on a going concern basis.
Foreign currency
Foreign currency transactions are translated into the functional 
currency of the relevant entity using the exchange rates prevailing 
at the dates of the transactions or at the balance sheet date where 
items are re-measured. Foreign exchange gains and losses resulting 
from the settlement of such transactions and from the translation at 
period-end exchange rates of monetary assets and liabilities 
denominated in foreign currencies are recognised in the statement 
of comprehensive income within finance income or finance costs.
Consolidation
The consolidated financial statements consolidate the Company and 
its subsidiaries. These accounting policies have been adopted by all 
Group companies.
Subsidiaries
Subsidiaries are all entities (including structured entities) over  
which the Company has control. The Company controls an entity 
when the it is exposed to, or has rights to, variable returns from  
its involvement with the entity and has the ability to affect those 
returns through its power over the entity. Subsidiaries are fully 
consolidated from the date on which control is transferred to the 
Company. They are deconsolidated from the date that control 
ceases. Transactions, balances and unrealised gains on  
transactions between Group companies are eliminated.
Joint arrangements
Arrangements under which the Company has contractually agreed  
to share control with another party or parties are joint ventures 
where the parties have rights to the net assets of the arrangement, 
or joint operations where the parties have rights to the assets  
and obligations for the liabilities relating to the arrangement. 
Investments in entities over which the Company has the right to 
exercise significant influence but neither control nor joint control  
are classified as associates.
Investments in joint ventures and associates are accounted for using 
the equity method, under which the investment is initially recognised 
at cost and subsequently adjusted for the Company’s share of 
post-acquisition income less dividends received and the Company’s 
share of other comprehensive income and other movements in 
equity, together with any loans of a long-term investment nature. 
Where necessary, adjustments are made to the financial statements 
of joint ventures and associates to bring the accounting policies 
used into line with those of the Company. In an exchange of assets 
and liabilities for an interest in a joint venture, the non-Group share 
of any excess of the fair value of the assets and liabilities transferred 
over the pre-exchange carrying amounts is recognised in income. 
Unrealised gains on other transactions between the Company and 
its joint ventures and associates are eliminated to the extent of the 
Company’s interest in them; unrealised losses are treated similarly  
but may also result in an assessment of whether the asset 
transferred is impaired.
The Company recognises its assets and liabilities relating to its 
interests in joint operations, including its share of assets held jointly 
and liabilities incurred jointly with other partners.
Acquisitions
The Company uses the acquisition method of accounting to account 
for business combinations. Identifiable assets acquired and liabilities 
and contingent liabilities assumed in a business combination are 
measured at their fair values at the acquisition date. The Company 
recognises any non-controlling interest in the acquiree at fair  
value at time of recognition or at the non-controlling interest‘s 
proportionate share of net assets. Acquisition-related costs are 
expensed as incurred.
Farm-in/farm-out
Farm-out transactions relate to the relinquishment of an interest in 
oil and gas assets in return for services rendered by a third party or 
where a third party agrees to pay a portion of the Company’s share 
of the development costs (cost-carry). Farm-in transactions relate to 
the acquisition by the Company of an interest in oil and gas assets in 
return for services rendered or cost-carry provided by the Company.
Farm-in/farm-out transactions undertaken in the development or 
production phase of an oil and gas asset are accounted for as an 
acquisition or disposal of oil and gas assets. The consideration given 
is measured as the fair value of the services rendered or cost-carry 
provided and any gain or loss arising on the farm-in/farm-out is 
recognised in the statement of comprehensive income. A profit is 
recognised for any consideration received in the form of cash to the 
extent that the cash receipt exceeds the carrying value of the 
associated asset.
Farm-in/farm-out transactions undertaken in the exploration phase 
of an oil and gas asset are accounted for on a no gain/no loss basis 
due to inherent uncertainties in the exploration phase and 
associated difficulties in determining fair values reliably prior to the 
determination of commercially recoverable proved reserves.
Significant accounting judgements and estimates
The preparation of the financial statements in accordance with IFRS 
requires management to make judgements and assumptions that 
affect the reported results, assets and liabilities. Where judgements 
and estimates are made, there is a risk that the actual outcome 
could differ from the judgement or estimate made. Management  
has assessed the following as being areas where changes in 
estimates or assumptions could have a significant impact on the 
financial statements.
86
Genel Energy plc Annual Report 2015
genelenergy.com Estimation of oil and gas reserves
Reserves and resources impact the Company’s financial statements 
in a number of ways, including: the calculation of depreciation and 
amortisation; testing for impairment; determining the timing of 
decommissioning activity and associated costs and going concern 
and viability.
Estimates of oil and gas reserves are inherently imprecise, require 
the application of judgement and are subject to future revision. 
Proven and probable reserves are estimates of the amount of oil  
and gas that can be economically extracted from oil and gas assets. 
The Company estimates its reserves using standard recognised 
evaluation techniques. Proven and probable reserves are 
determined using estimates of oil and gas in place, recovery factors 
and future commodity prices, the latter having an impact on the 
total amount of recoverable reserves. Future development costs are 
estimated taking into account the level of development required to 
produce the reserves.
In general, estimates of resources for undeveloped or partially 
developed fields are subject to greater uncertainty over their future 
life than estimates of reserves for fields that are substantially 
developed and being depleted. As a field goes into production, the 
amount of proved reserves will be subject to future revision once 
additional information becomes available through, for example, the 
drilling of additional wells or the observation of long-term reservoir 
performance under producing conditions. As those fields are further 
developed, new information may lead to revisions. 
Future development costs used in impairment testing and 
depreciation of oil and gas properties
Certain classes of property, plant and equipment related to oil and 
gas exploration and production activities are depreciated using a 
unit-of-production method over 2P reserves. Since 2P reserves 
assume future development cost to access the proved and probable 
reserves, an estimate of future development costs is required for the 
calculation of depreciation.
The Group’s estimation of future development costs is based on past 
costs, experience and data of similar in the region, future petroleum 
prices and the Company’s plans to develop its assets. However, 
actual costs may be different from those estimated. Changes in 
estimates of reserve quantities and/or estimates of future 
development expenditure are reflected prospectively in the 
depreciation and amortisation calculation.
Estimation of realised export price used to calculate reported 
revenue and trade receivables
Export sales are accrued using a netback, principally comprised of the 
estimated realised sales price for each barrel of oil sold, less selling, 
transportation and handling costs and estimates to cover additional 
costs. The Company does not have direct visibility on the components 
of netback because sales are managed by the KRG. As no 
reconciliation has been performed and agreed with the KRG, 
management has estimated the price or cost for each component of 
netback. For each component of netback, management has made its 
best estimate of prices or costs based on a range communicated by 
the KRG. Management has estimated the costs outlined above at the 
higher end of the likely range, reflecting uncertainties in actual 
realised netback.
Actual realised sales price used to calculate netback and entitlement 
when a reconciliation is performed with the KRG may be different to 
the estimate made by management.
Trade receivables
The Company reported trade receivables of $422.9 million owed by 
the KRG principally for export sales that were made after 2014. The 
KRG has stated publicly on a consistent basis that it intends to fully 
repay the debt and has demonstrated its commitment by making 5 
monthly payments between September 2015 and the end of February 
2016. On 1 February 2016, the KRG announced an interim measure 
whereby monthly payments to IOCs would be made based on an 
agreed mechanism. The mechanism has been put in place with the 
objective of simplifying the calculation of a monthly payment that will 
include an element that is a proxy for entitlement for the month, 
together with an element that is intended to contribute towards 
repayment of the receivable. The KRG has stated that it intends to 
increase the repayment contribution as the oil price improves.
Management expect that ultimately a reconciliation calculating full 
entitlement under the terms of the PSC will be agreed with the KRG 
– this reconciliation will form the basis for calculating amounts owed 
and the final settlement of the balance.
The Company assess the receivable balance as fully recoverable, with 
management expectation that it will be settled with cash, although it 
is possible that the debt could be settled in a number of ways. The 
success and pace of the recovery of the balance depends on some or 
all of a number of factors, including: the financial environment in the 
KRI and the financial budget of the KRG; oil price; volumes of 
production from the KRI as a whole; and ongoing negotiations with 
regard to various sources of potential finance. Management does not 
have direct visibility on the working capital of the KRG or its budget 
constraints, but continues to monitor the position based on its regular 
conversations with the KRG. 
Management has compared the carrying value of trade receivables 
reported in the balance sheet to its fair value. When assessing fair 
value, management has taken into account a range of inputs related 
to likely pricing of domestic, government refinery and export sales, 
interest accruing at LIBOR plus 2% in line with the PSC and 
management’s assessment of the likely timing of discounted  
cash flows. 
No revenue or receivable has been recognised for export sales that 
were made before 2014 (including exports marketed by SOMO) where 
payment is outstanding), the total unrecognised receivable balance is 
estimated of circa $340 million.

Genel Energy plc Annual Report 2015
genelenergy.com NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

1. Summary of significant accounting policies 
continued
Decommissioning costs
Provision for decommissioning represents the present value of 
decommissioning costs relating to the Kurdistan oil and gas 
interests, which are expected to be incurred at the end of field life, 
currently estimated to be in the period 2031 – 2039. These provisions 
have been created based on the Company’s internal estimates. 
Assumptions, based on the current economic environment, have 
been made which management believe are a reasonable basis upon 
which to estimate the future liability. Those estimates are reviewed 
regularly to take into account any material changes to the 
assumptions. However, actual decommissioning costs will  
ultimately depend upon future market prices for the necessary 
decommissioning works required, which will reflect market 
conditions at the relevant time. Furthermore, the timing of 
decommissioning is likely to depend on when the fields cease  
to produce at economically viable rates. This in turn will depend 
upon future oil and gas prices, which are inherently uncertain. 
Business combinations
The recognition of business combinations requires the excess of the 
purchase price of acquisitions over the net book value of assets 
acquired to be allocated to the assets and liabilities of the acquired 
entity. The Company makes judgements and estimates in relation to 
the fair value allocation of the purchase price.
The fair value exercise is performed at the date of acquisition. Owing 
to the nature of fair value assessments in the oil and gas industry, 
the purchase price allocation exercise and acquisition-date fair value 
determinations require subjective judgements based on a wide 
range of complex variables at a point in time. Management uses  
all available information to make the fair value determinations. 
In determining fair value for the acquisition, the Company has 
utilised valuation methodologies including discounted cash flow 
analysis. The assumptions made in performing these valuations 
include assumptions as to discount rates, foreign exchange rates, 
commodity prices, the timing of development, capital costs, and 
future operating costs. Any significant change in key assumptions 
may cause the acquisition accounting to be revised.
Segmental reporting
IFRS 8 requires the Company to disclose information about its 
business segments and the geographic areas in which it operates. It 
requires identification of business segments on the basis of internal 
reports that are regularly reviewed by the entity’s chief operating 
decision maker in order to allocate resources to the segment and 
assess its performance. The Company has two reportable business 
segments: Kurdistan and Africa. These are described in note 2.
Intangible assets
Exploration assets
Exploration assets are explained under oil and gas assets in 
property, plant and equipment below.
Other intangible assets
Other intangible assets (predominantly software) that are acquired 
by the Company are stated at cost less accumulated amortisation 
and less accumulated impairment losses.
Amortisation is charged to the statement of comprehensive income 
on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of intangible 
assets from the date they are available for use, unless such lives are 
indefinite. Intangible assets with an indefinite useful life and goodwill 
are systematically tested for impairment at each balance sheet date.
Property, plant and equipment
Property, plant and equipment comprises the Company’s tangible  
oil and gas assets together with leasehold improvements and other 
assets and is carried at cost, less any accumulated depreciation and 
accumulated impairment losses. Costs include purchase price and 
construction costs together with borrowing costs where applicable 
for qualifying assets. Depreciation of these assets commences when 
the assets are available for their intended use.
Oil and gas assets
Costs incurred prior to obtaining legal rights to explore are 
expensed immediately to the statement of comprehensive income.
Exploration, appraisal and development expenditure is accounted 
for under the successful efforts method. Under the successful 
efforts method only costs that relate directly to the discovery and 
development of specific oil and gas reserves are capitalised as 
exploration and evaluation assets within intangible assets. Costs  
of activity that do not identify oil and gas reserves are expensed.
All lease and licence acquisition costs, geological and geophysical 
costs and other direct costs of exploration, evaluation and 
development are capitalised as intangible assets or property, plant 
and equipment according to their nature. Intangible assets comprise 
costs relating to the exploration and evaluation of properties which 
the directors consider to be unevaluated until reserves are appraised 
as commercially viable, at which time, following an impairment review, 
they are transferred to property, plant and equipment and reclassified 
as development assets. Where properties are appraised to have no 
commercial value, the associated costs are expensed as an 
impairment loss in the period in which the determination is made.
Development expenditure on producing assets is accounted for in 
accordance with IAS 16–Property, plant and equipment.
Assets are depreciated once they are available for use and are 
depleted on a field-by-field basis using the unit of production 
method. Depreciation takes account of book costs and estimated 
future development costs and uses the unit of production method  
by dividing production for the period by 2P reserves by production. 
Changes to depreciation rates as a result of changes in reserve 
quantities and estimates of future development expenditure are 
reflected prospectively.
Depreciation is charged so as to write off the cost, less estimated 
residual value, over the estimated useful lives of the assets using the 
straight-line method:
Motor vehicles 5 years  
Computer equipment 3 years  
Other equipment 3-5 years
The estimated useful lives of property, plant and equipment and 
their residual values are reviewed on an annual basis and, if 
necessary, changes in useful lives are accounted for prospectively. 
The gain or loss arising on the disposal or retirement of an asset is 
determined as the difference between the sales proceeds and the 
carrying amount of the asset and is recognised in the statement of 
comprehensive income for the relevant period.
Where exploration licences are relinquished or exited for no 
consideration or exploration expenses are neither derisking an asset 
nor adding value to the asset, the associated costs are expensed to 
the income statement as exploration costs written-off.
88
Genel Energy plc Annual Report 2015
genelenergy.com Subsequent costs
The cost of replacing part of an item of property and equipment is 
recognised in the carrying amount of the item if it is probable that 
the future economic benefits embodied within the part will flow to 
the Company, and its cost can be measured reliably. The net book 
value of the replaced part is expensed. The costs of the day-to-day 
servicing and maintenance of property, plant and equipment are 
recognised in the statement of comprehensive income.
Leases
Leases in which a significant portion of the risks and rewards of 
ownership are retained by the lessor are classified as operating 
leases. Payments made under operating leases (net of any 
incentives received from the lessor) are charged to the statement 
of comprehensive income on a straight-line basis over the period  
of the lease.
Financial assets and liabilities
Classification
The Group assesses the classification of its financial assets on initial 
recognition as either at fair value through profit and loss, loans and 
receivables; or available for sale. The Group assesses the 
classification of its financial liabilities on initial recognition as fair 
value through profit and loss or amortised costs.
Recognition and measurement
Regular purchases and sales of financial assets are recognised at fair 
value on the trade date – the date on which the Group commits to 
purchase or sell the asset. Loans and receivables are subsequently 
carried at amortised cost using the effective interest method.
Trade and other receivables
Trade receivables are amounts due from crude oil sales, sales of  
gas or services performed in the ordinary course of business. If 
collection is expected in one year or less (or in the normal operating 
cycle of the business if longer), they are classified as current assets. 
If not, they are presented as non-current assets.
Trade receivables are recognised initially at fair value and 
subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective 
interest method, less provision for impairment.
Cash and cash equivalents
In the consolidated balance sheet and consolidated statement  
of cash flows, cash and cash equivalents includes cash in hand, 
deposits held on call with banks, other short-term highly liquid 
investments with original maturities of three months or less and 
includes the Group’s share of cash held in joint operations.
Interest-bearing borrowings
Borrowings are recognised initially at fair value, net of transaction 
costs incurred. Borrowings are subsequently carried at amortised 
cost; any difference between the proceeds (net of transaction costs) 
and the redemption value is recognised in the statement of 
comprehensive income over the period of the borrowings using the 
effective interest method.
Fees paid on the establishment of loan facilities are recognised as 
transaction costs of the loan to the extent that it is probable that 
some or all of the facility will be drawn down. In this case, the fee  
is deferred until the draw-down occurs. To the extent there is no 
evidence that it is probable that some or all of the facility will be drawn 
down, the fee is capitalised as a pre-payment for liquidity services and 
amortised over the period of the facility to which it relates.
Borrowings are presented as long or short-term based on the 
maturity of the respective borrowings in accordance with the loan or 
other agreement. Borrowings with maturities of less than twelve 
months are classified as short-term. Amounts are classified as 
long-term where maturity is greater than twelve months. Where no 
objective evidence of maturity exists, related amounts are classified 
as short-term.
Trade and other payables
Trade and other payables are recognised initially at fair value. 
Subsequent to initial recognition they are measured at amortised 
cost using the effective interest method.
Provisions
Provisions are recognised when the Company has a present 
obligation as a result of a past event, and it is probable that the 
Company will be required to settle that obligation.
Provisions are measured at management’s best estimate of the 
expenditure required to settle the obligation at the balance sheet 
date, and are discounted to present value where the effect is material.
The unwinding of any discount is recognised as finance costs in the 
statement of comprehensive income.
Decommissioning
Provision is made for the cost of decommissioning assets at the  
time when the obligation to decommission arises. Such provision 
represents the estimated discounted liability for costs which are 
expected to be incurred in removing production facilities and  
site restoration at the end of the producing life of each field. A 
corresponding item of property, plant and equipment is also  
created at an amount equal to the provision. This is subsequently 
depreciated as part of the capital costs of the production facilities. 
Any change in the present value of the estimated expenditure 
attributable to changes in the estimates of the cash flow or the 
current estimate of the discount rate used are reflected as an 
adjustment to the provision.
Offsetting
Financial assets and liabilities are offset and the net amount 
reported in the balance sheet when there is a legally enforceable 
right to offset the recognised amounts and there is an intention to 
settle on a net basis or realise the asset and settle the liability 
simultaneously.
Impairment
Property, plant and equipment
The carrying amounts of the Company’s non-financial assets are 
reviewed at each reporting date to determine whether there is any 
indication of impairment. If any such indication exists then the 
asset’s recoverable amount is estimated.
The recoverable amount of an asset or cash-generating unit is the 
greater of its value in use and its fair value less costs of disposal. In 
assessing fair value, an estimation is made of the price that would  
be received to sell an asset. In assessing value in use, the estimated 
future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a 
pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments  
of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset. 
Key assumptions in the discounted cash flows used to assess the fair 
value of property, plant and equipment are oil price, reserves and 
resources, operating expenditure and government deductions from 
revenue and discount rate.

1. Summary of significant accounting policies 
continued
For the purpose of impairment testing, assets are grouped together 
into the smallest group of assets that generates cash inflows from 
continuing use that are largely independent of the cash inflows  
of other assets or groups of assets (cash generating unit).
The estimated recoverable amount is then compared to the carrying 
value of the asset. Where the estimated recoverable amount is 
materially lower than the carrying value of the asset an impairment 
loss is recognised if the carrying amount of an asset or its cash-
generating unit exceeds its recoverable amount.
Non-financial assets that suffered impairment are reviewed for 
possible reversal of the impairment at each reporting date.
Financial assets
A financial asset is assessed at each reporting date to determine 
whether there is any objective evidence that it is impaired. A 
financial asset is considered to be impaired if objective evidence 
indicates that one or more events have had a negative effect on the 
estimate of future cash flows of that asset.
An impairment loss in respect of a financial asset measured at 
amortised cost is calculated as the difference between its carrying 
amount, and the present value of the estimated future cash flows 
discounted at the original effective interest rate. All impairment 
losses are recognised as an expense in the statement of 
comprehensive income.
An impairment loss is reversed if the reversal can be related 
objectively to an event occurring after the impairment loss  
was recognised.
Share capital
Ordinary shares are classified as equity.
Revenue
Revenue for petroleum sales are recognised when the significant 
risks and rewards of ownership have passed to the buyer and the 
associated revenue can be reliably measured. Revenue is measured 
at the fair value of the consideration received excluding discounts, 
rebates, value added tax (VAT) and other sales tax or duty.
The significant risks and rewards of ownership are deemed to have 
passed on delivery of crude oil to the customer at the point of 
loading and revenue is recognised accordingly to the extent that the 
receipt of cash is assessed as sufficiently probable and the amount 
of revenue can be reliably measured.
Where income tax arising from the Group’s activities under 
production sharing contracts is settled by a third party at no cost 
and on behalf of the Group and where the Group would otherwise  
be liable for such income tax, the associated sales are shown gross 
including the notional tax and a corresponding income tax charge  
is presented in the statement of comprehensive income.
Employee benefits
Short-term benefits
Short-term employee benefit obligations are expensed to the 
statement of comprehensive income as the related service is 
provided. A liability is recognised for the amount expected to be paid 
under short-term cash bonus or profit-sharing plans if the Group has 
a present legal or constructive obligation to pay this amount as a 
result of past service provided by the employee and the obligation 
can be estimated reliably.
Share-based payments
The Group operates a number of equity-settled, share-based 
compensation plans. The economic cost of awarding shares and 
share options to employees is recognised as an expense in the 
statement of comprehensive income equivalent to the fair value  
of the benefit awarded. The fair value is determined by reference  
to option pricing models, principally Monte Carlo and adjusted 
Black-Scholes models. The charge is recognised in the statement  
of comprehensive income over the vesting period of the award.
At each balance sheet date, the Group revises its estimate of  
the number of options that are expected to become exercisable.  
Any revision to the original estimates is reflected in the statement  
of comprehensive income with a corresponding adjustment to 
equity immediately to the extent it relates to past service and the 
remainder over the rest of the vesting period. The proceeds received 
net of any directly attributable transaction costs are credited to 
share capital (nominal value) and share premium when the options 
are exercised.
Finance income and finance costs
Finance income comprises interest income on funds invested and 
foreign currency gains. Interest income is recognised as it accrues, 
using the effective interest method.
Finance expense comprises interest expense on borrowings, and 
foreign currency losses. Borrowing costs directly attributable to the 
acquisition of a qualifying asset as part of the cost of that asset are 
capitalised over the respective assets.
Borrowing costs, including the accretion of any discount on initial 
recognition of borrowings, incurred for the construction of any 
qualifying asset are capitalised during the period of time that is 
required to complete and prepare the asset for its intended use  
or sale. Other borrowing costs are expensed in the consolidated 
statement of comprehensive income.
Taxation
Under the terms of the Kurdistan PSCs, under which oil sales are 
made, any tax due is paid directly from the government’s take of 
revenues. This would normally be presented for as a gross up of 
revenue with a corresponding taxation expense in the statement of 
comprehensive income. No gross up of revenue and presentation of 
taxation expense has been accounted for in the period because, as a 
consequence of the uncertainty over the payment mechanism for oil 
sales in Kurdistan, it has not been possible to measure the quantum 
of taxation that has been paid on behalf of the Group by the KRG.
Related parties
Parties are related if one party has the ability, directly or indirectly, 
to control the other party or exercise significant influence over the 
party in making financial or operational decisions. Parties are also 
related if they are subject to common control. Transactions between 
related parties are transfers of resources, services or obligations, 
regardless of whether a price is charged and are disclosed 
separately within the notes to the consolidated financial information.
New standards
The following standards have been adopted by the Group for  
the first time for the financial year beginning on or after 1 January 
2014 and do not have a material impact on the group: IFRS 10, 
‘Consolidated financial statements’, IFRS 11, ‘ Joint arrangements’ 
and IFRS 12, ‘Disclosures of interests in other entities’.
A number of new standards and amendments to standards and 
interpretations have been issued but are not yet effective and not 
early adopted. None of these are expected to have significant effect 
on the consolidated financial statements of the Group.

The Group has two reportable business segments, which are its oil and gas exploration and production business in the KRI and its oil and gas 
exploration business in Africa. Capital expenditure decisions for the KRI business segment are considered in the context of the cash flows 
expected to be made from the production and sale of crude oil. Capital expenditure for the African segment is considered in the context of 
the available cash of the Group.
Finance income is not considered part of a business segment and forms part of the reconciliation to reported numbers. For the period ended

genelenergy.com 7. Income tax expense
A taxation charge of $1.0 million (2014: $1.5 million) was made in the Turkish and UK services companies. All other corporation tax due in KRI 
is deemed paid on behalf of the Group by the KRG from it’s own share of revenues. There is no tax payment required or expected to be made 
by the Group as revenue is received after tax.
The tax paid by the government in accordance with the terms of the KRI PSCs would usually be presented as a gross up of revenue and  
a corresponding taxation expense in the statement of comprehensive income with no cash outflow. In the Group’s results for the periods 
ended 31 December 2015 and 31 December 2014, no presentation of taxation expense with an equivalent gross up for revenue has been 
accounted for because it has not been possible to measure reliably the amount of taxation paid on behalf of the Group because of 
uncertainties over how the amount of taxation should be calculated. This is an accounting presentational issue and there is no taxation  
to be paid. For the same reason, it has not been possible to assess whether it is necessary to gross up the acquired assets for deferred tax.
8. Earnings per share

of shares in issue during the period.

Diluted
For diluted earnings per share, the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue is adjusted to include all potential dilutive ordinary 
shares. The Group has four types of potential dilutive ordinary shares:
• Shares granted to directors and employees under the performance share plan, to the extent that performance conditions have been met 
at the period end
• Share options granted to employees under the share option plan, where the exercise price is less than the average market price of the 
Company’s ordinary shares during the period
• Shares granted to employees under the restricted share plan
• Shares and securities issued to the founders of the Company, to the extent that performance conditions have been met at the period end

Oil and gas assets comprise principally the Group’s share of oil assets at the Taq Taq and Tawke producing fields in the Kurdistan Region of 
Iraq. Other assets include leasehold improvements, office furniture and motor vehicles.
Property, plant and equipment is assessed annually for impairment indicators and if impairment indicators exist the assets are then 
assessed for impairment. In the current year, sustained low oil price and production that was lower than expectation represented indicators 
of impairment for the Company’s two producing oil assets: Taq Taq and Tawke. Impairment assessments for both assets were prepared on a 
value in use basis using discounted future cash flows based on estimated 2P reserves profiles. The key assumptions used for the impairment 
testing were:
Discount
rate 
Short-term
Brent oil price 
assumption
2016/2017
Long-term
Brent oil price 
assumption 
from 2020
Kurdistan 12.5% $40–45/bbl $75/bbl
The Taq Taq asset was impaired by $1,038 million following a reduction in reserves and long term oil price. For the Tawke asset, where there 
was no impairment, a $5/bbl change in Brent oil price assumption would result in an impairment of circa $50 million; and a 1% change in 
discount rate assumption would result in an impairment of circa $25 million.

Trade receivables are monies owed by the KRG, principally for export sales. Although the trade receivable balance is due for payment, 
management has assessed that, based on current price of oil and the current payment mechanism in place, it is unlikely that the full balance 
will be recovered before the end of 2016. Management has therefore classified the balance expected to be recovered in the year, based on 
current oil prices, as current, with the remainder of the balance presented as non-current. The pace of recovery of the balance owed may

Trade receivables
The Company reported trade receivables of $422.9 million owed by the KRG principally for export sales that were made after 2014. The KRG 
has stated publicly on a consistent basis that it intends to fully repay the debt. On 1 February 2016, the KRG announced an interim measure 
whereby monthly payments to IOCs would be made based on an agreed mechanism. The mechanism has been put in place with the 
objective of simplifying the calculation of a monthly payment that will include an element that is a proxy for entitlement for the month, 
together with an element that is intended to contribute towards repayment of the receivable. The KRG has stated that it intends to  
increase the repayment contribution as the oil price improves.
Management expect that ultimately a reconciliation calculating full entitlement under the terms of the PSC will be agreed with the KRG  
– this reconciliation will form the basis for calculating amounts owed and the final settlement of the balance.
The Company assess the receivable balance as fully recoverable, with management expectation that it will be settled with cash, although it 
is possible that the debt could be settled in a number of ways. The success and pace of the recovery of the balance depends on some or all 
of a number of factors, including: the financial environment in the KRI and the financial budget of the KRG; oil price; volumes of production 
from the KRI as a whole; and ongoing negotiations with regard to various sources of potential finance. Management does not have direct 
visibility on the working capital of the KRG or its budget constraints, but continues to monitor the position based on its regular 
conversations with the KRG. 
Management has compared the carrying value of trade receivables reported in the balance sheet to its fair value. When assessing fair value, 
management has taken into account a range of inputs related to likely pricing of domestic, government refinery and export sales, interest 
accruing at LIBOR plus 2% in line with the PSC and management’s assessment of the likely timing of discounted cash flows. 
No revenue or receivable has been recognised for export sales that were made before 2014 (including exports marketed by SOMO), where 
payment is outstanding the total recognised recievable balance is estimated at circa $340 million.
Cash
The Company takes a conservative approach to its cash management. Cash is deposited in treasury bills or term deposits with banks that 
are assessed as appropriate based on, among other things, sovereign risk, CDS pricing and credit rating. 
All of the Company’s financial assets are payable on demand. Generally the timing of the cash flows associated with the assets results in the 
carrying value being a reasonable estimation of their fair value. 
Liquidity risk
The Group is committed to ensuring it has sufficient liquidity to meet its payables as they fall due. At 31 December 2015 the Group had cash 
and cash equivalents of $455.3 million (2014: $489.1 million). 
Commodity price risk
The revenue of the Company is sensitive to oil price, although impact is somewhat reduced by the PSC mechanism of calculating revenue 
based on cost oil and profit oil.
Interest rate risk 
The Group had borrowings of $694.1 million (2014: $491.4 million) as of 31 December 2015. Interest is payable at a fixed coupon rate of 7.5% 
on the nominal value of $730 million. 
Capital management
The Company manages its capital to ensure that it remains sufficiently funded to support its business strategy and maximise shareholder 
value. The funding needs of the Company are met principally from the cash flows generated from its operations, with a robust balance sheet 
and cash at year-end of $455.3 million.

genelenergy.com Fair value was measured either by use of the Black-Scholes pricing model or by use of a formula based on past calculations. The model  
takes into account assumptions regarding expected volatility, expected dividends and expected time to exercise. In the absence of sufficient 
historical volatility for the Company, expected volatility was estimated by analysing the historical volatility of FTSE-listed oil and gas 
producers over the three years prior to the date of grant. The expected dividend assumption was set at 0%. The risk-free interest rate 
incorporated into the model is based on the term structure of UK Government zero coupon bonds. The inputs into the fair value calculation 
for RSP and PSP awards granted in 2015 and fair values per share using the model were as follows:

20. Acquisitions
On 22 September 2015 the group acquired a 36% operated stake in the Bina Bawi field, thereby increasing its interest to 80%. The 
consideration comprises an upfront payment of $5 million; a contingent payment of $70 million is payable once gas production exceeds 
certain threshold volumes from the Miran and Bina Bawi fields; a second contingent payment of $75 million is payable two years after the 
date of the second payment. In addition, in consideration for the KRG approving the transaction, the Company released the KRG from 
monies owed of $25 million, which was owed in relation to past expenses incurred on the Miran field that accured after KRG exercised it back 
in right in September 2013.

In order to recognise the deferred consideration at its fair value, the balance has been discounted using an estimate for the credit risk of the 
Company by using the implied cost of debt of the Company at the time of the transaction of circa 13%. This has resulted in a balance of 
$70.6 million being recognised at the acquisition date.

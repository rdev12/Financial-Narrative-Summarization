Despite challenges we 
faced during the year, 
we’ve taken concrete 
action in line with  
our strategy.
Throughout this Annual Report  
we explain our vision and 
strategy for growth.  We are dedicated to serving our 
customers from over 30 locations 
worldwide
Our operations include a network of corn wet mills in the US and Europe which 
are shared by our two business divisions. We also operate two SPLENDA
®
 
Sucralose facilities in the US and Singapore, and a number of other ingredient 
processing plants and blending facilities worldwide. We work closely with 
customers all over the world through our network of applications and technical 
facilities, centred around our global innovation hub, the Commercial and Food 
Innovation Centre in Chicago, USA.
Americas Europe, Middle East and Africa Asia Pacific
Our principal manufacturing assets in  
the US include four major corn wet mills. 
Three are located in the Midwest, and one 
in Tennessee. Other key sites include our 
SPLENDA
®
 Sucralose facility in McIntosh, 
Alabama, a citric acid plant in Ohio and  
a Food Systems blending facility in Illinois. 
We have expanded our presence in  
Latin America by the acquisition of a 
majority stake in Gemacom Tech in Brazil. 
This Food Systems business includes  
both blending facilities and a customer-
facing applications laboratory. Other 
manufacturing assets in the region include 
our citric acid plant in Brazil and our 
joint-venture corn wet mill in Mexico. 
In Europe, our operations include five major 
corn wet mills, including our wholly-owned 
plant in the Netherlands and four joint-
venture plants located mainly in the Eastern 
European corn belt. In April 2015, we 
announced the re-alignment of this joint 
venture, see page 10 for more details. 
Our oat-based fibres facility in Sweden has 
been key to enhancing Tate & Lyle’s health 
and wellness portfolio. Other assets in Europe 
include our four Food Systems facilities in 
Italy, Germany and the UK.
In the Middle East and Africa, we operate  
a corn wet mill in Morocco and a Food 
Systems blending facility in South Africa.
In line with our strategy to grow our 
speciality food ingredients business in 
emerging markets, we have in recent years 
significantly enhanced our presence in 
China through our Food Systems business, 
Tate & Lyle Howbetter. During the year,  
we completed the acquisition of Winway 
Biotechnology – a business in the 
fast-growing fibre category in China. 
In April 2015 we announced the closure  
of our SPLENDA
®
 Sucralose plant in 
Singapore from spring 2016, as part  
of re-focusing and re-structuring our 
SPLENDA

STRATEGIC REPORT FINANCIAL STATEMENTS GOVERNANCE USEFUL INFORMATION
Tate & Lyle PLC | Annual Report 2015 | 0 3   Innovation and Commercial 
Development (ICD)
ICD is a key enabler of Tate & Lyle’s growth strategy. It brings 
together open innovation, research and development, global 
marketing and platform management into one global team,  
to provide an integrated approach towards developing and 
commercialising innovative new products and technologies.
While ICD supports both of Tate & Lyle’s divisions, it 
concentrates particularly on SFI. As a result, ICD’s resources 
are predominantly focused on three broad platforms within  
the global speciality food ingredients market – sweeteners, 
texturants and health and wellness.
Ideas are generated from both internal and external sources. 
Internally, these come from work done by our own scientists. 
Externally, we generate ideas from engagement with our 
customers and from our dedicated Open Innovation team  
which seeks to develop partnerships with universities, research 
institutions and start-ups specialising in food science and  
novel ingredients.
Global Operations 
Global Operations, established in November 2014, is responsible  
for safety, manufacturing, transportation and logistics, sales  
and operations planning, customer service, corn procurement, 
sustainability, and process technology.
The creation of Global Operations represents an important step 
towards simplifying our global structure and allowing the different 
parts of the business to focus on what they do best – our 
commercial divisions on serving customers, and Global Operations 
on delivering operational and supply chain excellence.
The Group also has a Global Quality team which is responsible for 
overseeing the application of strict quality control procedures and 
testing of all product lines. The Global Quality team is independent 
of the Global Operations group.
Global Shared Services Centre
Our Global Shared Services Centre, based in Łód´ z, Poland, 
supports a common way of working across our business. We have 
standardised our systems and financial processes, to provide a 
platform to deliver efficiency gains by eliminating the unnecessary 
duplication of resources. Our team of over 220 multilingual 
employees, scalable office space and team structure mean  
it can be a centre of excellence that grows with the business. 
Global IS/IT system
The core of our business operates a single integrated information 
systems and information technology (IS/IT) system, which was 
specifically designed for the increasingly global nature of our 
business and the progressively more complex supply chains we 
have around the world. The new system will allow us to gather  
and process information more quickly, enabling us to be more 
responsive to customers.

STRATEGIC REPORT FINANCIAL STATEMENTS GOVERNANCE USEFUL INFORMATION USEFUL INFORMATION FINANCIAL STATEMENTS GOVERNANCE STRATEGIC REPORT Summary
This has been a very challenging year  
for the Group as we have experienced a 
number of challenges which have had  
a significant impact on our financial and 
operating performance. In the face of these 
challenges, Javed and his team are taking 
the necessary actions to identify and 
address the root causes, and minimise  
our exposure in the future.
Notwithstanding this, I am pleased the 
Group continues to make progress against 
our strategic objective set out in 2010 of 
building a foundation on which to deliver 
steady, sustainable growth in Speciality 
Food Ingredients. 
Safety
Once again, I am greatly saddened to have 
to report a fatality at one of our facilities. In 
June, one of our employees died in a tractor 
accident at one of our grain storage facilities 
in the US. This was in addition to two 
fatalities, as a result of the accident that  
I reported last year that occurred in 
Singapore in April 2014. The tragic loss of 
these lives reminds us yet again why safety 
is, and must always be, our first priority. 
While extensive analysis of the five fatalities 
which have occurred over the last two years 
has not revealed any common cause, during 
the year we undertook a thorough review 
across the Group of our safety management 
programme and accident prevention 
initiatives. This included the use of external 
safety auditors to review safety management 
and controls at our major manufacturing 
sites. Based on the findings of the review,  
a number of actions have been taken to 
further strengthen our safety processes, 
details of which are set out in the Corporate 
Responsibility section on page 39.
Dividend
The Board recognises the importance  
of dividends to shareholders and remains 
committed to the dividend policy it 
implemented in 2009. Underpinned by  
the confidence it has in the strategy of the 
business, the Board intends to recommend 
an unchanged final dividend for the year 
ended 31 March 2015 of 19.8p to make a 
total for the year of 28.0p, an increase of 
1.4%. Further, the Board intends to maintain 
the total dividend payment at 28.0p for the 
year ending 31 March 2016.
Subject to shareholder approval, the 
proposed final dividend will be due and 
payable on 31 July 2015 to all shareholders 
on the Register of Members at 3 July 2015. 
It has been a very challenging 
year for the Group but the 
determination of our employees 
across the business to  
improve our performance  
has been unwavering.
 
06 | Tate & Lyle PLC | Annual Report 2015
How would you 
sum up the year?
STRATEGIC REPORT | CHAIRMAN’S STATEMENT  Strategic progress 
During the year, we further strengthened our 
Speciality Food Ingredients business with the 
launch of two major new products and by 
the completion of two ‘bolt-on’ acquisitions. 
On 21 April 2015, just after the year end,  
we announced two major actions to re-align 
our business to further strengthen and focus 
on Speciality Food Ingredients. 
The first is reaching an agreement to re-align 
our European Eaststarch joint venture with 
Archer Daniels Midland Company. Through 
this re-alignment, which is subject to 
regulatory clearances and is expected to 
close in the summer, we will exit the 
predominantly Bulk Ingredients plants in 
Bulgaria, Turkey and Hungary and acquire 
full ownership of the more speciality-focused 
plant in Slovakia. 
The second is our decision to re-focus  
and re-structure our SPLENDA
®
 Sucralose 
business. As a result of significantly changed 
industry economics, we decided to make 
some fundamental changes to how we 
approach the sucralose market and our 
manufacturing footprint. More specifically,  
in addition to pursuing a rigorous value-
based approach to securing volume,  
we will materially lower our cost base by 
consolidating all SPLENDA
®
 Sucralose 
production into our US facility, and by 
closing our Singapore facility in spring 2016. 
These actions will position SPLENDA
®
 
Sucralose as a more focused, low-cost and 
sustainable business. 
The decision to close the Singapore facility, 
which has played an important role in 
establishing the prominent position of 
SPLENDA
®
 Sucralose in the global high-
intensity sweetener market, was not taken 
lightly by the Board. While this decision 
results in an impairment charge of 
£113 million, even taking into account the 
anticipated closure costs, the facility has 
provided strong returns to investors over  
its life-cycle which have been well in excess 
of our cost of capital.
I would like to thank all our employees in  
the Eaststarch joint venture and at our 
Singapore facility who will be leaving the 
Group, for their support and commitment 
over the years. I wish them well for the future.
Operational performance 
The particularly prolonged and severe 
2013/14 winter in the US meant that we 
entered the year with significantly reduced 
inventory levels which impacted our ability  
to fulfil customer orders. Our ability to meet 
orders for SPLENDA
®
 Sucralose was also 
impacted by the extended shutdown of the 
Singapore plant following the accident in 
April 2014. These factors, together with 
unexpectedly strong demand in emerging 
markets, placed significant pressure on our 
global supply chain, leading to additional 
costs of fulfilment and some missed sales 
opportunities. 
As a result of these issues, a detailed review 
of our global planning and supply chain 
processes was conducted. We have also 
confirmed that, although no material 
incremental capital investment was required 
to better manage customer needs beyond 
the programme of capital expenditure 
announced as part of our May 2014 full year 
results, improvements were needed in  
our operating and supply chain planning 
capabilities and to other internal planning 
processes. A programme to implement 
these improvements is underway.
Board composition 
On 1 September, Nick Hampton joined  
Tate & Lyle as Chief Financial Officer having 
spent 20 years working at PepsiCo. Nick 
brings extensive financial, commercial and 
technical experience to Tate & Lyle and is  
a very welcome addition to our executive 
team and our Board.
We are very grateful to Tim Lodge for his 
important contribution in his six years as 
Chief Financial Officer and throughout his 
25-year career with Tate & Lyle. We wish him 
every success in the next stage of his career.
At the end of December, Robert Walker 
stepped down from the Board following the 
completion of his term of appointment and  
I would like to thank Robert for his 
commitment and hard work during his 
tenure.
In January, we welcomed Paul Forman to  
the Board as a non-executive director and  
a member of the audit, remuneration and 
nominations committees. Paul’s wide 
experience of managing international 
businesses, developing business-to-business 
customer and market-led strategies, and 
commercialising innovation pipelines will be 
of significant benefit to the Board. 
Capital allocation policy
The effective use of capital on behalf of 
shareholders is our primary objective. To 
support our growth strategy we believe in 
maintaining an efficient, but prudent, capital 
structure, while retaining the flexibility to 
invest in growing the business. As such, our 
balance sheet will continue to be managed 
to maintain debt ratios within an investment 
grade credit rating. Our priorities for the 
allocation of capital are as follows: 
• First of all we want to ensure that we  
have sufficient resources to invest in the 
business to fund working capital and 
growth in Speciality Food Ingredients
• Second, is our commitment to a 
progressive dividend policy, where we aim 
to grow the dividend over time taking into 
account the earnings prospects of the 
business
• Third, we will look to maintain flexibility to 
accelerate our strategy through selective 
acquisitions.
Conclusion
It has been a very challenging year for the 
Group but the determination of our 
employees across the business to improve 
our performance has been unwavering.  
I would like to acknowledge their hard work 
and, on behalf of the Board, thank them for 
their outstanding commitment and support.

STRATEGIC REPORT | CHIEF EXECUTIVE’S REVIEW 
How did we address 
the challenges faced 
this year?
We put in place a programme 
to implement improvements 
required to operating and supply 
chain planning capabilities and  
to internal planning processes.
  Overview of the Group’s performance
The Group’s performance for the year was 
significantly held back by three main factors: 
first, the impact of operational and supply 
chain issues experienced mainly in the first 
half of the financial year; secondly, the 
continued extremely competitive market  
for SPLENDA
®
 Sucralose; and thirdly, the 
impact in the second half of the financial 
year of volatility and lower pricing in some  
of the commodity markets in which our Bulk 
Ingredients business operates.
Adjusted sales for the year were £2,694 
million (2014 – £3,147 million), 14% lower 
than the prior year (11% in constant 
currency), with adjusted sales in Speciality 
Food Ingredients down 8% (4% in constant 
currency) to £908 million (2014 – £983 
million) and 17% lower in Bulk Ingredients 
(14% in constant currency) at £1,786 million 
(2014 – £2,164 million). Adjusted operating 
profit was 29% lower (27% in constant 
currency) at £247 million (2014 – £349 
million), with adjusted operating profit in 
Speciality Food Ingredients down 30%  
(29% in constant currency) to £149 million  
(2014 – £213 million), and 23% lower (19%  
in constant currency) in Bulk Ingredients at 
£133 million (2014 – £172 million). Adjusted 
profit before tax was 30% lower (28% in 
constant currency), at £224 million (2014 – 
£322 million), and adjusted diluted earnings 
per share was 32% lower (29% in constant 
currency) at 37 .7p (2014 – 55.7p). 
Balance sheet and financial 
management
Net debt of £504 million at 31 March 2015 
was higher than at the end of the prior year 
(2014 – £353 million), resulting mainly from 
lower earnings, capital investments in 
growth of Speciality Food Ingredients, 
dividend payments and adverse exchange 
movements of £46 million (including 
£7 million from joint ventures), primarily as  
a result of an increase in the value of dollar- 
denominated debt due to the strengthening 
of the US dollar against sterling.
The key performance indicators (KPIs) of  
our financial strength, the ratio of net debt  
to pre-exceptional earnings before interest, 
tax, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) 
and interest cover, remain well within our 
internal thresholds. At 31 March 2015,  
the net debt to EBITDA ratio was 1.3 times  
(2014 – 0.8 times), against our internal 
threshold of 2.0 times, and interest cover  
on total operations was 10.7 times,  
(2014 – 11.6 times), comfortably ahead  
of our minimum threshold of 5.0 times.
The return we generate on our assets 
decreased during the year due to lower 
earnings with a return on capital employed 
of 13.9% (2014 – 19.2%), although this 
remains well ahead of our weighted average 
cost of capital.
Our average quarterly cash conversion  
cycle worsened by eight days to 47 days 
(2014 – 39 days) resulting primarily from 
higher inventory days, as we rebuilt inventory 
and recovered from supply chain disruption, 
and higher receivables days, partially offset 
by higher payables days. 
Safety
As a result of the four tragic accidents that 
occurred in the 2013 and 2014 calendar 
years which led to five fatalities, during the 
year we undertook a thorough review of our 
safety management and accident prevention 
programmes across the Group. This 
included the use of external safety auditors 
to review safety management and controls 
at all of our major manufacturing sites. 
Based on these reviews, we have further 
strengthened our safety and accident 
prevention programmes, which are being 
overseen by the Corporate Responsibility 
Committee of the Board. Our clear priority 
going forward is to re-establish the 
consistently high level of safety performance 
we have achieved in previous years.
New supplementary disclosure 
framework
To provide more detail on our business 
performance, in addition to the segmental 
disclosure required under IFRS (which 
remains unchanged), and given the evolving 
nature of the business including the changes 
announced in April, we intend to disclose 
additional information regarding the 
performance of our operating segments.  
We believe this will provide a clearer 
understanding of the drivers of performance, 
better highlight the impact of commodity 
volatility, and drive a greater understanding 
of the sustainable growth potential of the 
business. Details of the additional 
disclosures are set out on page 31.
Operational and supply chain 
disruption
Internal operational and supply chain 
disruption significantly impacted our 
business during the year, leading both to 
additional costs of order fulfilment totalling 
£20 million and some missed sales 
opportunities. This disruption occurred due 
to a combination of factors. The unusually 
prolonged and severe 2013/14 winter in  
the US caused operational difficulties in our 
US plants which led us to enter the 2015 
financial year with much lower inventories 
than usual. Then, in the first quarter of the 
financial year, following an industrial 
accident, our SPLENDA

in Singapore had to take an extended 
shutdown. These events materially disrupted 
our supply chain as we had to manage a 
combination of operational challenges in  
our plant network, low absolute levels of 
inventory, and misalignments between 
customer demand and inventory location.
As a result of these issues, in September 
2014, we initiated a detailed review of our 
global demand, supply and planning 
processes. This review, which was 
completed in February 2015, confirmed  
that the programme of incremental capacity 
expansion announced as part of our May 
2014 full year results, together with ongoing 
actions to increase inventory held closer  
to our customers, will allow us to better 
manage customer needs. The additional 
capacity is expected to come on stream  
in the second half of the 2016 financial year 
as planned. The review also highlighted that 
improvements were required to operating 
and supply chain planning capabilities and 
to the robustness of internal planning 
processes. A programme to implement 
these improvements is progressing well and 
a number of actions are already in place. We 
will continue to execute these improvements 
during the course of the 2016 financial year. 
SPLENDA
®
 Sucralose
Adjusted operating profit from SPLENDA
®
 
Sucralose for the year ended 31 March 2015 
was £16 million, 73% lower than the prior 
year (2014 – £62 million). As a result of this 
significant deterioration in profitability, during 
the year we undertook a detailed analysis  
of this business to evaluate how best to 
maximise returns. This analysis found that, 
while demand for sucralose remains strong 
driven largely by consumer desire for more 
calorie-reduced food and drink and by the 
superior taste and functionality that 
sucralose delivers, a substantial increase in 
industry capacity, particularly over the past 
two years, had led to supply being well in 
excess of demand. This had caused 
industry behaviour and economics to 
change significantly and we do not expect 
this situation to change materially in the 
medium term. 
Accordingly, on 21 April 2015, we 
announced our SPLENDA
®
 Sucralose 
business would be re-focused in two ways. 
First, by taking a rigorous valued-based 
approach to securing volume by focusing  
on the areas where we see value with 
customers who fully value the benefits  
of our SPLENDA
®
 Sucralose product  
including quality, provenance, food safety 
and responsible manufacturing and 
environmental practices. Secondly, by 
materially lowering the manufacturing cost 
base of the business by consolidating all 
production into our McIntosh, Alabama 
facility in the US from spring 2016. After a 
phased transition over the next 12 months, 
the Singapore facility will close permanently. 
We expect to invest around £18 million  
to consolidate production in McIntosh.  
This mainly relates to the transfer of 
equipment from Singapore to McIntosh  
and for additional equipment at McIntosh  
to produce all our SPLENDA
®
 Sucralose 
Tate & Lyle PLC | Annual Report 2015 | 0 9  
STRATEGIC REPORT FINANCIAL STATEMENTS GOVERNANCE USEFUL INFORMATION product forms. When the transfer is 
complete in spring 2016, McIntosh will be 
capable of supplying our customers’ existing 
and ongoing needs. 
The Singapore facility has played an 
important role in establishing the prominent 
position of SPLENDA
®
 Sucralose in the 
global high-intensity sweetener market and 
has provided strong returns to investors over 
its life-cycle which have been well in excess 
of our cost of capital. However, the 
combined effect of lower market pricing and 
higher energy and other production costs  
at the location, led us to conclude that the 
facility will not be cost competitive going 
forward. The McIntosh facility operating  
at a higher scale and utilisation level than  
it does currently will provide a materially 
lower-cost manufacturing position from 
which to operate. 
SPLENDA
®
 Sucralose is an integral 
ingredient in many of our customers’ 
products, and sucralose continues to be  
the most incorporated high-intensity 
sweetener in new product launches globally. 
The fundamental changes we are making  
to how we approach the market and our 
manufacturing footprint will position 
SPLENDA
®
 Sucralose as a more focused, 
low-cost and sustainable business. We 
expect this business to be around 
breakeven before the impact of exceptional 
items in the year ending 31 March 2016, with 
some anticipated transition costs offsetting 
a lower depreciation charge, and looking 
further ahead, we expect the business to 
return to modest profitability  
in the 2017 financial year.
Re-alignment of the Eaststarch 
European joint venture
On 21 April 2015, we signed an agreement 
with Archer Daniels Midland Company 
(ADM) to re-align our Eaststarch C.V. 
(Eaststarch) joint-venture corn wet milling 
business in Europe in which we each own  
a 50% equity share. Under the terms of the 
agreement, we will:
• Strengthen our Speciality Food 
Ingredients business by acquiring full 
ownership of the more speciality-focused 
plant in Slovakia
• Substantially reduce our European Bulk 
Ingredients footprint by exiting the 
predominantly Bulk Ingredients plants  
in Bulgaria, Turkey and Hungary which  
will transfer to ADM
• Receive a cash sum of €240 million at 
closing, subject to customary closing 
adjustments, including for net cash and 
working capital, and an additional payment 
of up to €20 million in 2019 conditional on 
future corn and sugar pricing
• Continue to supply our European 
customers with crystalline fructose, a 
speciality sweetener, by being appointed 
as exclusive distributor for crystalline 
fructose produced from the plant in Turkey 
under a long-term agreement
• Focus our European business on 
speciality food ingredients by appointing 
ADM as exclusive agent for bulk 
ingredients produced from the plant in 
Slovakia and Tate & Lyle’s wholly-owned 
corn wet mill in the Netherlands under  
a long-term agreement. 
Completion of the agreement is conditional 
upon regulatory clearances which we 
expect in summer 2015. 
The reform of the EU Sugar Regime in 
October 2017 opens the way to greater 
competition between isoglucose and sugar 
in the EU that will bring with it the need for 
potentially significant capital investment in 
bulk sweeteners. Our strategy since 2010 
has been to invest for growth in Speciality 
Food Ingredients and, therefore, the 
re-alignment of the joint venture enables  
us to realise good value from our European 
Bulk Ingredients’ assets before a decision 
on capital investment is required.
In the year ended 31 March 2014, Eaststarch 
had adjusted operating profit of £107 million 
of which the Group has a 50% share. Due  
to lower EU sugar prices, the results of 
Eaststarch for the year ended 31 March 
2015 were around 23% lower at £83 million.
Had the transaction taken effect from 1 April 
2014, Group adjusted operating profit in the 
year ended 31 March 2015 would have been 
reduced by £32 million and diluted earnings 
per share would have been reduced by  
5.5 pence. Depending on the timing of 
completion of the transaction and the final 
transition arrangements, we anticipate the 
reduction on Group earnings will be 
somewhat lower in the year ending 31 March 
2016. We anticipate that, following the 
impact of re-structuring the European 
operations, from the start of the year ending 
31 March 2017 the dilution in earnings as a 
result of the transaction will be around  
3 pence per share. 
The re-alignment of Eaststarch represents 
another important step in the evolution of 
Tate & Lyle into a global speciality food 
ingredients business. The plant in Slovakia 
provides a solid base from which to grow 
our speciality food ingredients business  
in Europe, and we intend to increase the 
production of speciality food ingredients  
at the plant over time. As a result of the 
re-alignment, the proportion of Group 
adjusted operating profit from Speciality 
Food Ingredients (excluding SPLENDA
®
 
Sucralose) will increase from 47% to around 
55%, and in Europe, Speciality Food 
Ingredients will effectively contribute all  
of the profit.
Reducing volatility in Bulk Ingredients 
Our strategy is to progressively re-position 
our Bulk Ingredients division to dampen 
volatility and create a more stable, cash-
generative business. The re-alignment  
of the Eaststarch joint venture, which will  
result in the Group substantially exiting  
bulk sweeteners in Europe and therefore 
reducing our exposure to volatility in the  
EU sugar market (which impacted our profits 
in the second half of the 2015 financial year), 
is fully in line with that strategy. 
Following the re-alignment, Bulk Ingredients 
will become a predominantly North 
American business. In North America,  
Bulk Ingredients benefits from strong 
positions in mature but large markets such 
as bulk sweeteners and industrial starches, 
long-standing customer relationships, and 
scale, efficient manufacturing assets. In the 
US, these manufacturing assets (corn wet 
mills) are integrated with the production of 
speciality food ingredients and therefore 
also provide an efficient manufacturing  
base from which to support growth in  
that business.
North America also has structural 
advantages which enable better 
management of the volatility inherent in this 
business. For example, in the US, unlike in 
Europe, we have access to a corn futures 
market which allows us to hedge US corn 
exposures. In addition, we continue to 
proactively manage the business to  
dampen volatility where possible, such  
as by moving more customers in the US  
to tolling contracts which now represent 
around 75% of US bulk sweetener volumes. 
Increasing the number of toll customers 
helps to reduce the risk of underlying 
commodity movements.

Chief Executive’s Review continued
STRATEGIC REPORT Solid strategic progress in Speciality 
Food Ingredients
While the financial performance of the 
Speciality Food Ingredients division during 
the year was held back by supply constraints 
and price erosion in SPLENDA
®
 Sucralose, 
the underlying business and demand for our 
products remains strong, and we made good 
progress on a number of fronts.
We continue to build our technical expertise 
and infrastructure in the higher growth 
markets of Asia Pacific and Latin America,  
in which adjusted sales for the business 
excluding SPLENDA
®
 Sucralose and Food 
Systems now represent 15% of total adjusted 
sales in Speciality Food Ingredients, up from 
8% in 2011. Asia Pacific and Latin America 
(excluding Food Systems) now represent 
nearly 20% of the employees in Speciality 
Food Ingredients. 
We executed two ‘bolt-on’ acquisitions in 
Asia Pacific and Latin America during the 
year. In August, we completed the acquisition 
of Winway Biotechnology Nantong Co., Ltd 
based in Nantong, China. Winway is a 
producer of polydextrose fibre in China and 
this acquisition provides a strong base from 
which to accelerate the growth of our dietary 
fibres business in Asia Pacific. In December, 
we acquired a majority equity interest in 
Gemacom Tech Indústria e Comércio S.A. 
(Gemacom), the leading domestically-owned 
food systems business in Brazil. During 
December, we paid £12 million to terminate 
distribution rights previously held by a  
third party to sell our crystalline fructose  
to customers primarily in Asia Pacific.  
We continue to actively explore further 
opportunities, including acquisitions and 
partnerships, with a strong focus on Asia 
Pacific and Latin America.
Robust innovation pipeline
Innovation is a key driver of long-term growth 
for Tate & Lyle. Our innovation approach 
starts with a deep understanding of the 
consumer and to ensure that changing 
consumer perceptions and trends influence 
the categories we operate in. Our 
understanding of these long-term global 
consumer trends drives our innovation 
approach and priorities, such as the 
increasing demand for convenience food,  
a much greater focus on health and wellness 
particularly in light of the rising incidence of 
obesity and diabetes worldwide, and an 
increasing preference for ‘natural’ and 
‘clean-label’ foods. Our aim is to help 
consumers make healthier and tastier 
choices whenever they eat or drink and to 
deliver this we focus our resources and 
expertise in three main areas of market 
opportunity: calorie, sugar, salt and fat 
reduction; fibre enrichment; and ‘clean label’. 
These are attractive spaces to operate  
in given growing strong consumer demand. 
For example, global product launches 
containing fibres between calendar years 
2011 and 2014 increased by a compound 
annual growth rate (CAGR) of 33%, reflecting 
increased consumer awareness of the 
importance of fibre in diets.
During the year, we launched two major  
new products which directly address two  
of the consumer trends we are focusing  
on – calorie reduction and ‘clean label’.  
Both these new products were developed  
at our three year-old global Commercial and 
Food Innovation Centre in Chicago, USA, 
demonstrating the innovation capabilities  
we are steadily beginning to build.
In September, we launched our new 
CLARIA
®
 line of functional ‘clean-label’ 
starches. CLARIA
®
 starches, developed 
through a proprietary patent-pending 
process, provide food manufacturers  
with functionality similar to modified food 
starches but with the benefits of a cleaner 
colour, a cleaner taste, and a ‘clean label’  
(ie they label simply as ‘starch’). 
Then, in February, we launched DOLCIA 
PRIMA
TM
 Allulose, a low-calorie sugar in the 
US. DOLCIA PRIMA
TM
 is our brand name for 
allulose, a sugar that exists in nature but that 
has 90% fewer calories than sucrose (table 
sugar). To produce allulose, we developed a 
unique, patent-protected process to convert 
basic agricultural raw materials (currently 
corn in the US) into allulose. DOLCIA 
PRIMA
TM
 is expected to allow food and 
beverage manufacturers to significantly 
reduce the calories in products while 
maintaining the same great taste and texture 
of sugar which consumers enjoy. 
Both these new product launches have 
attracted strong customer interest reflecting 
the health and wellness benefits they bring 
to consumers and their relevance to our 
customers’ development priorities. A range of 
projects with customers are underway giving 
us confidence in their long-term potential.
New products, although still relatively small, 
are growing strongly with an 86% volume 
CAGR rate between the 2011 and 2015 
financial years, and volume in the 2015 
financial year almost double the prior year. 
The pipeline remains robust with a number 
of projects at various stages of development 
including four in the final stages with 
expected launches in the next 12-24 months. 
Strengthening the executive 
management team
The senior leadership team was substantially 
strengthened during the year with the 
objective of leading the Group into the next 
stage of its development. During the year, 
the following appointments were made to 
the Group Executive Committee:
i) Gabriella Parisse was appointed 
President, Innovation and Commercial 
Development from 1 May 2014. Gabriella 
joined Tate & Lyle in September 2012 as 
Senior Vice President, Global Marketing, 
having previously spent 25 years at 
Johnson & Johnson. 
ii) Nick Hampton was appointed Chief 
Financial Officer (and a member of the 
Board of Directors) from 1 September 
2014. Nick joined Tate & Lyle from 
PepsiCo where he worked for 20 years.
iii) Joan Braca was appointed President, 
Speciality Food Ingredients from  
1 November 2014. Joan joined Tate & Lyle 
in January 2013 as Senior Vice President 
& General Manager, Asia Pacific, 
Speciality Food Ingredients. Prior to 
joining Tate & Lyle, Joan spent nearly  
20 years in the speciality chemicals 
industry mainly with Rohm and Haas  
(part of the Dow Chemical Company 
since 2009).
iv) Rowan Adams was appointed Executive 
Vice President, Corporate Affairs from  
13 November 2014 with global 
responsibility for communications and risk 
management. Rowan joined Tate & Lyle 
from National Westminster Bank in 2001.
v) Pierre Schoumacher was appointed 
President of the newly formed Global 
Operations unit from 13 November 2014 
with responsibility for activities from  
raw material procurement through to 
manufacturing, supply chain and 
logistics. Pierre joined Tate & Lyle from 
Procter & Gamble in 2000. 
vi) Jim Stutelberg joined Tate & Lyle on 
1 December 2014 and was appointed 
President, Bulk Ingredients. Jim joined  
from PPG Industries where he led its 
Automotive Coatings business. Prior to  
that, he spent 13 years with Dow Corning.
Delivering a global IS/IT system
In August, we successfully rolled out our 
single, global IS/IT system to our North 
American business. This followed the 
upgrade of this system in our European 
business (not including the Food Systems 
business) in May. We are now focused  
on fully embedding the new processes  
and systems.
Tate & Lyle PLC | Annual Report 2015 | 11  
STRATEGIC REPORT FINANCIAL STATEMENTS GOVERNANCE USEFUL INFORMATION Conclusion
The long-term transformation of Tate & Lyle 
continues to be a major undertaking with 
nearly all areas of the global business 
impacted in some way. Infrastructure, 
systems, processes and the organisation 
have all been materially changed. In some 
areas such as innovation, our customer-
facing capabilities, our presence in Asia 
Pacific and Latin America, and the strength 
of our people, we have made very good 
progress. In others, such as our global 
supply chain, we have faced major 
challenges and work is underway to address 
these. I would like to thank all employees 
across Tate & Lyle for their continued hard 
work and dedication during what has been  
a challenging year.
While our financial performance in the year 
has been disappointing, the underlying 
business and demand for our products 
remains strong. With a portfolio of products 
with strong market positions, an expanding 
global footprint, and a steady flow of new 
products targeted at addressing major 
consumer trends, particularly in the health 
and wellness space, our Speciality Food 
Ingredients business is structurally well-
positioned for the future. 
By re-aligning the Eaststarch joint venture, 
Bulk Ingredients will reduce its exposure to 
volatility in the form of European sugar price 
fluctuations, and become a predominantly 
North American business with strong market 
positions and scale, efficient assets. These 
assets also provide a low cost manufacturing 
base from which to support continuing 
growth in Speciality Food Ingredients.
We are firmly focused on improving our 
performance and continuing the evolution  
of Tate & Lyle into a global Speciality Food 
Ingredients business supported by cash 
generated from Bulk Ingredients. As we enter 
the new financial year, we believe Tate & Lyle 
is a more streamlined, focused and higher 
quality business, capable of generating 
sustained growth over the long term. 
Key performance indicators (KPIs)
Our KPIs for the year ended 31 March 2015 
are detailed on pages 22 and 23.
Outlook
The year ahead will be one of structural 
change as we re-align the Eaststarch joint 
venture and SPLENDA
®
 Sucralose, embed 
changes to improve our global supply chain 
capabilities, and bring on line additional 
growth capacity for Speciality Food 
Ingredients. We anticipate that, in this year of 
change, adjusted profit before tax for the year 
ending 31 March 2016 will be broadly in line 
with the 2015 financial year on a pro-forma
1
 
basis assuming the Eaststarch transaction 
completes in the summer as expected.
The longer term outlook for the business 
remains positive. We expect the global 
market for speciality food ingredients to 
grow at mid-single digits and our objective  
is to grow modestly ahead of the market via 
organic growth supplemented by ‘bolt-on’ 
acquisitions. We continue to target sustained 
cash flows from Bulk Ingredients and to 
dampen volatility where possible. As the  
mix of the Group moves towards our higher 
margin Speciality Food Ingredients business 
augmented by operational improvements, 
over time we expect to steadily enhance 
Group profit and returns on capital.

SPECIALITY FOOD INGREDIENTS
Strong consumer trends
The global market for speciality food 
ingredients is large and growing, underpinned 
by strong consumer trends: increasing demand 
for convenience food; and also for ingredients 
with health and wellness benefits; and 
consumers requiring ‘clean-label’ ingredients.
Focus and depth
Our strategy is to focus on three core 
platforms and to have deep expertise within 
each one:
• Sweeteners
• Texturants
• Health and wellness.
BULK INGREDIENTS
Mature consolidated industry
Bulk Ingredients operates in a mature, 
consolidated industry, manufacturing largely 
commodity products, where the level of 
profitability is related to the level of industry 
capacity utilisation.
Steady sustained cash generation
Our strategy is to generate sustained  
long-term cash flows to help fund growth  
in Speciality Food Ingredients: 
• Optimise margins 
• Optimise and fill grind capacity 
• Ensure security of raw material supply
• Dampen volatility.

What does the global  
marketplace look like?
STRATEGIC REPORT | OUR MARKETPLACE Convenience
• Changes in consumer lifestyles continue  
to increase the demand for packaged and 
convenience foods.
• Product launches with a ‘convenient’ claim  
in 2014 were nearly 50% higher than three 
years ago. 
• 77% of global convenience product launches 
in 2014 had a ‘health and wellness’ claim.
• Tate & Lyle’s ingredients and expertise in 
convenience foods draw on decades of 
development across a wide range of 
products, including ready meals, soups, 
sauces, dressings, fillings, toppings and 
instant powder concepts.
Health and wellness
• Consumers are increasingly aware of the  
link between diet and health and are seeking 
products enhanced or fortified with 
ingredients such as fibre.
• The number of product launches containing 
fibres increased by 12% globally in 2014. 
Since 2012, the increase is around 75% 
globally. 
• In addition to our strong fibres portfolio,  
we address another important health and 
wellness trend – salt reduction – through  
our SODA-LO
®
 Salt Microspheres.
‘Clean label’
• Food and beverage manufacturers are 
launching more ‘clean-label’ products in 
response to increasing consumer demand 
across a broad range of categories for 
products which are seen as more ‘natural’  
or ‘free from’. 
• Around 25% of new product launches 
globally were positioned as label-friendly  
in 2014.
• We offer manufacturers a portfolio of 
label-friendly solutions; the most recent 
addition is our CLARIA
®
 Functional 
Clean-Label Starches launched in  
September 2014.
Corn market dynamics
• The US corn wet milling industry processes 
around 11% of the US crop annually. 
• The 2014/15 corn harvest in the US delivered 
a record crop with production slightly ahead 
of the previous harvest. As a result, US corn 
prices trended lower in the first half of the 
year and were at an average of around  
$4 a bushel in the second half. 
• The industry’s returns depend on capacity 
utilisation. The closure of a competitor plant in 
January 2015 has tightened industry capacity.
• In Europe, corn prices declined in the first 
half of the year but increased slightly in the 
second half and are currently lower than a 
year ago.

Bulk corn sweeteners
• Demand for US bulk corn sweeteners, 
including HFCS, is closely linked to the 
consumption of regular sweetened 
carbonated soft drinks (CSDs).
• During the year, demand for regular CSDs  
in the US was relatively stable, although 
production challenges in the 2013/14 winter 
meant sweeteners supply was tight.
• Demand for US HFCS in Mexico was lower 
due to continued low Mexican sugar prices  
(a substitute for HFCS) and the effect of 
calorie consumption taxes.
• In Europe, the market operates under a 
volume quota system. The continued decline 
in EU sugar prices placed significant 
pressure on EU sweetener prices.
Industrial markets
• Starch demand in the paper industry was 
steady, with a decline in printing and writing 
paper demand offset by growth in packaging 
papers and tissue.
• In Europe, additional starch capacity, 
particularly from wheat processors, was 
balanced by a robust packaging sector.
• Whilst US ethanol margins were healthy in 
the first half of the year, conditions in the 
industry deteriorated in the second half as 
inventories rose to a three-year high towards 
the end of financial year 2015.

How do we deliver value 
to our customers?
Consumer insights drive our product development, 
and, together with the sector knowledge of our food 
scientists, differentiate us from our competitors and 
help our customers meet consumer needs. We apply 
our manufacturing know-how to turn agricultural raw 
materials into high-quality food ingredients for delivery  
to our customers worldwide. 
Sourcing raw materials
Most of our ingredients are produced from crops, 
predominantly corn, and we have a sustainable 
agriculture programme in place. Ensuring we have  
a reliable source of corn is essential. This involves 
understanding commodity markets and developing 
long-term, mutually beneficial relationships with 
producers to secure supply.

Sustainable agriculture
OUR BUSINESS MODEL
We use our know-how,  
built up over many years, to 
transform raw materials into 
high-quality food ingredients. 
These ingredients are used 
by our customers to create 
foods consumed by millions 
of people every day.

Producing high-quality 
ingredients in a  
sustainable way
During the year our production facilities included: 
• A network of corn wet mills in North America and Europe  
that manufacture both bulk and speciality ingredients
• Two large-scale continuous SPLENDA

Environmental sustainability
• We work to address environmental considerations  
across the life-cycle of our products
• We seek to improve environmental  
sustainability by using resources such as  
energy and water more efficiently, and  
reducing waste.
Provenance, quality  
and ethical standards
Food safety, quality, provenance and traceability are 
very high priorities for our business. Our manufacturing 
facilities are externally certified to the Global Food Safety 
Initiative each year. Supply chain ethics are important  
to us and our customers. We work with our suppliers to 
help them achieve our clear standards, both operational 
and ethical, and meet our compliance needs. We use 
the Sedex social and ethical compliance system across 
our manufacturing facilities and increasingly in our 
supply chain.

What differentiates us?
Customer relationships
We work closely with customers to provide them with high quality 
ingredients and solutions to address the challenge of creating great 
tasting, healthy food that meets the needs of consumers. Our local 
customer teams work in regional application centres to solve 
customers’ taste, ingredient and formulation challenges locally. 
A truly global operating model
We operate through two global divisions – Speciality Food 
Ingredients and Bulk Ingredients. Each division has its own sales 
force and commercial operations to provide the necessary focus 
and expertise to customers in their respective end markets.  
Both divisions are supported by a single manufacturing network 
producing high-quality ingredients. 
How has our business  
model evolved this year?
We established Global Operations, a single global organisation with 
responsibility for raw material procurement, manufacturing, supply

STRATEGIC REPORT FINANCIAL STATEMENTS GOVERNANCE USEFUL INFORMATION Strengthening customer relationships
During the year we have been working more 
closely with customers in a number of ways. 
Our main customer facing facility in Chicago, 
USA, has been the centre for a number of 
significant projects, including CLARIA
®
 
Functional Clean-Label Starches, launched 
in September 2014. We involved customers 
very early in the development of CLARIA
®
, 
which was essential for ensuring its 
commercial viability. Six months on, we have 
customer wins in North America, Asia Pacific 
and Latin America and, at the date of this 
Annual Report, are conducting a joint trial of 
the product with one of the world’s largest 
fruit preparation manufacturers. 
Meanwhile, in Europe, our innovation 
centres have been working together to host 
customers. One key highlight was a visit to 
our European centres by a major Asian dairy 
customer, reinforcing our strategic 
partnership.
Working with customers is not limited to  
our innovation centres and our sales 
organisation, however, we also encourage 
customers to visit our plants, which helps 
deepen the relationship at every level. This 
year, US manufacturing sites hosted senior 
executives and employees from across 
marketing, manufacturing and supply chain 
functions, to meet with their counterparts  
at Tate & Lyle. This provides a valuable 
opportunity to learn more about our 
operations, share best practices and 
develop ideas for how we can further 
strengthen our partnerships in the future. 
Bringing new products to market
In February 2015, we launched our exciting 
new ingredient, DOLCIA PRIMA™ Allulose,  
a low-calorie sugar. Because of the 
challenges of replacing standard table sugar 
with sweeteners, low-calorie sugar is a very 
attractive proposition for the food industry, 
but one that, until now, has not been 
technically possible on a commercial scale. 
Allulose is a sugar that exists in nature, but 
has 90% fewer calories than sucrose (table 
sugar), and to launch DOLCIA PRIMA™,  
we have developed an innovative production 
process that is unique to Tate & Lyle.  
We worked closely with selected customers  
at various stages in the development  
of DOLCIA PRIMA™ to obtain their 
invaluable input.
We also expect to launch a number of other 
products over the next 12-24 months –  
our innovation pipeline includes a range  
of projects across the various stages of 
development, from original concept,  
through to more developed commercial, 
manufacturing and execution planning,  
and includes several projects in the later 
stages. We aim for a balanced pipeline,  
with a combination of next-generation, 
breakthrough projects and line extensions 
across our three platforms. We aim to 
engage customers at an early stage of the 
development cycle, which helps ensure we 
have the right technical and commercial 
strategy for each product.

Delivering growth in Asia Pacific and 
Latin America 
We continued to invest in Asia Pacific and 
Latin America by acquiring businesses that 
will help accelerate our growth. In December 
2014, we acquired a majority equity interest  
in Gemacom Tech, the leading domestically-
owned food systems business in Brazil. 
Established in 1990, and strategically located 
close to the key markets of São Paulo, Rio de 
Janeiro and Belo Horizonte, Gemacom Tech 
has built a reputation for quality and customer 
service with its range of food quality 
standards and certifications. Its commitment 
to safety also makes the company an 
excellent partner for Tate & Lyle. 
In Asia, we completed the acquisition of 
Winway Biotechnology Nantong Co., Ltd,  
a Chinese producer of polydextrose dietary 
fibre based in Nantong, China, and also 
re-purchased certain distribution rights to  
sell crystalline fructose directly to customers 
primarily in Asia Pacific. 
Our investments in the higher growth Asia 
Pacific and Latin America have generated 
strong returns, with adjusted sales for the 
business, excluding SPLENDA
®
 Sucralose 
and Food Systems, now representing  
15% of total adjusted sales of Speciality 
Food Ingredients. 
Providing stable long-term cash flow
We have continued to pursue a strategy  
to dampen volatility in our Bulk Ingredients 
division and deliver sustained cash 
generation. We have progressively  
re-positioned our US business such that 
tolling contracts (contracts often 12 months 
or longer, in which the customer pays a 
manufacturing margin and takes on the 
primary corn commodity price risk) now 
represent around 75% of US corn sweetener 
volumes. In Europe, where tolling is less 
common and sweetener prices are 
referenced to EU sugar prices, prices and 
margins are more volatile, particularly given 
the absence of an efficient futures market to 
hedge corn prices such as exists in the US. 
This price volatility, especially ahead of the 
reform of the EU Sugar Regime (which 
comes into effect from October 2017) and the 
future capital investment that this is expected 
to require, were key factors in our decision  
to substantially exit this business in Europe.
In light of the operational challenges 
experienced as a result of the prolonged 
and severe winter in the US in 2013/14, we 
have carried out a number of preventative 
measures to protect our plants from the 
effects of severe winter weather. These 
actions included the implementation of 
specific operating protocols as part of our 
plants’ winterisation programme, as well  
as engaging with other industries that have 
significant operating experience in extreme 
cold conditions.
Sustainable cash generation from Bulk 
Ingredients to support Speciality Food 
Ingredients’ growth is a critical element of 
our strategy. The actions we have taken to 
minimise manufacturing disruption, together 
with the investment made over the past few 
years in an expanded corn elevator storage 
network to further strengthen our security  
of supply, provide key underpins to this.

STRATEGIC REPORT | SPECIALITY FOOD INGREDIENTS 
How did the division  
perform this year? Market conditions and trends
The global market for speciality food 
ingredients is worth around US$42 billion
1
, 
approximately half of which we currently 
address. The areas of the market where we 
compete continue to benefit from strong 
underlying global consumer trends including 
convenience, health and wellness, natural 
and ‘clean label’.
Changes in consumer lifestyles have 
increased the demand for packaged and 
convenience foods, for consumption both  
at home and ‘on the go’. In the 2014 calendar 
year, product launches with a ‘convenient’ 
claim were nearly 50% higher than three 
years previously
2
. Convenience products  
are also increasingly catering to consumer 
demands for healthier foods, with 77%  
of global convenience product launches in 
2014 also making a ‘health and wellness’ 
claim
2
. Demand for convenience is a global 
trend, with demand growing in developed 
markets, as well as in developing markets 
with increasing urbanisation and associated 
lifestyle changes. Convenience foods are a 
key driver for speciality food ingredients that 
provide functionality such as stability, texture 
and extended shelf-life.
The rising incidence of diabetes and obesity 
in both developed and developing markets  
is one of a number of global health concerns 
driving both consumers and governments  
to focus on the link between diet and health. 
In response to heightening consumer 
awareness, manufacturers are responding 
to the demand for ‘healthier’ products. In 
addition to products which address sugar, 
calorie and weight management, consumers 
are also increasingly seeking solutions for 
digestive health, including fibre-enhanced 
products, and for heart health including 
lower sodium products. 
In response to increasing consumer demand 
for more natural products across a wide 
range of categories, and to concerns around 
the provenance of finished and unfinished 
goods, and ingredient labelling, food and 
beverage manufacturers are launching more 
‘clean-label’ products. Around 25% of all 
new products launched globally in 2014 
were positioned as label-friendly
3
.
Against the backdrop of continuing 
challenging macroeconomic conditions  
in many countries and tighter household 
budgets, cost optimisation also continues  
to be a theme with food and beverage 
customers looking at ways to reduce costs 
and provide more value-based alternatives 
for consumers without compromising taste.
Our Speciality Food Ingredients business, 
with its deep technical expertise and 
portfolio of sweetener, texturising and health 
and wellness products, supplemented by 
new products launched from the innovation 
pipeline, is well-placed to benefit from these 
global consumer trends.
Financial performance
Within Speciality Food Ingredients, volumes 
grew by 2%. Although constrained by the 
impact of supply chain disruption, we 
delivered volume growth in all regions 
except North America. We estimate supply 
disruption impacted volume growth by 
approximately three to four percentage 
points. Adjusted sales decreased by 8%  
(4% lower in constant currency) to £908 
million (2014 – £983 million) reflecting the 
pass through of lower corn prices and the 
lower prices for SPLENDA
®
 Sucralose. 
Adjusted operating profit was lower than the 
prior year (down 29% in constant currency) 
at £149 million (2014 – £213 million) mainly 
as a result of lower selling prices for 
SPLENDA
®
 Sucralose and the impact of 
supply chain disruption. The prior year also 
included the majority of the £6 million one-off 
gain from the purchase, sale and leaseback 
of our building in Hoffman Estates, Illinois, 
and £7 million representing the final annual 
payment received from McNeil Nutritionals 
as part of the re-alignment of the sucralose 
business in 2004. The effect of currency 
translation was to decrease adjusted 
operating profit by £5 million.
Volume from new products nearly doubled 
in the year and adjusted sales reached 
£43 million or around 5% of total adjusted 
sales for the Speciality Food Ingredients 
division.
This division comprises three broad product 
categories: starch-based speciality 
ingredients, high-intensity sweeteners, and 
Food Systems.
Starch-based speciality ingredients
In starch-based speciality ingredients, 
adjusted sales decreased by 5% (3% in 
constant currency) to £562 million (2014 – 
£595 million). Volumes increased by 1% 
despite supply constraints, with strong 
growth in Asia Pacific and particularly strong 
demand for texturants. The lower value of 
sales reflects the impact of passing through 
the significant lower corn prices following 
the record 2013/14 corn crop. 
In food starches we saw overall volume 
growth, with strong growth in Asia Pacific, 
particularly in dairy applications, and 
broad-based European growth offset by 
North America where volume was 
particularly constrained.
In speciality corn sweeteners, volume was 
lower due to supply constraints. We saw 
good growth in Asia Pacific, where our 
business also benefited from the decision  
in December to terminate distribution rights 
previously held by a third party to sell our 
crystalline fructose primarily in the region. 
Volume for fibres was slightly lower than  
the comparative period due to supply 
constraints.
During the year we completed the acquisition 
of Winway Biotechnology Nantong Co., Ltd. 
a polydextrose fibre business in China.  
We also launched two major new products 
– the new CLARIA
®
 Functional Clean-Label 
Starches and DOLCIA PRIMA
TM
 Allulose,  
a low-calorie sugar.
High-intensity sweeteners
Adjusted sales in this product category, 
which comprises SPLENDA
®
 Sucralose  
and our no-calorie natural sweeteners, were 
18% lower than the prior year (15% lower  
in constant currency) at £162 million (2014 – 
£198 million) driven primarily by SPLENDA
®
 
Sucralose price declines. Volumes were  
1% higher. 
Food Systems
Adjusted sales were 3% lower than the  
prior year (4% higher in constant currency)  
at £184 million (2014 – £190 million), with 
volumes 15% higher. In December, we 
acquired a majority equity interest in 
Gemacom, the leading domestically-owned 
food systems business in Brazil, thereby 
adding to our Food Systems presence in  
the higher growth Latin American region. 
Excluding Gemacom, and on a constant 
currency basis, adjusted sales and profit 
were in line with the prior year, with the 
business continuing to benefit from the 
decision taken two years ago to focus  
on higher margin blends.

by 2%. This was due to supply 
constraints driven by the  
unusually prolonged and severe

our US plants and led us to enter 
the 2015 financial year with much

STRATEGIC REPORT | BULK INGREDIENTS 
How did the division  
perform this year? Market conditions and trends
The 2014/15 corn harvest in the US delivered 
a record crop with production slightly higher 
than the previous harvest which itself was a 
record crop. The stocks-to-use ratio remains 
healthy at around 13%. As a result, US corn 
prices trended lower through the first half, 
and market prices were low at an average  
of about $4 a bushel in the second half.  
The latest production estimate for the 
2015/16 corn harvest from the USDA
1
 is  
13.6 billion bushels or 4% lower than the 
previous year. However, corn supplies in 
2015/16 are projected at a record 15.5 billion 
bushels, up slightly from the previous year, 
as higher opening stocks more than offset 
lower production. 
Demand in the US for regular carbonated 
soft drinks, a key end-market for high 
fructose corn syrup (HFCS), recovered in 
summer 2014 following weak demand in the 
prior year. In the three-month period to end 
June 2014, regular carbonated soft drinks 
sales in the US grew by 1.4%
2
 against the 
weaker comparative period, with sales 
volume over the full year 0.1% higher. 
However, the prolonged and severe 2013/14 
US winter caused operational and supply 
chain challenges across the industry 
through the first half of the 2014 calendar 
year which, when combined with relatively 
firmer beverage demand, led to tight supply 
of bulk sweeteners. Despite the more stable 
demand in the 2015 calendar year, we 
continue to regard the US market for regular 
carbonated soft drinks to be in gradual, 
long-term structural decline.
Low Mexican sugar prices and the 
introduction, in January 2014, of calorie 
consumption taxes resulted in a 6%
3
 volume 
reduction in exports of US HFCS to Mexico 
in the 2014 calendar year. 
Sugar prices in Europe, which provide  
a reference price for our European bulk 
sweeteners, declined markedly reflecting 
volatile market conditions in anticipation  
of the reform of the EU Sugar Regime in  
October 2017 . 
The North American paper industry, a key 
source of demand for industrial starches, 
experienced healthy utilisation rates with a 
continued decline in printing and writing 
paper demand offset by growth in packaging 
and tissue. In Europe, whilst additional starch 
capacity, particularly from wheat plants, 
entered the market, a robust packaging 
sector helped mitigate this impact.
Conditions in the US ethanol industry 
deteriorated sharply in the second half of  
the financial year on the back of US ethanol 
inventories rising to a three-year high 
towards the end of the 2015 financial year, 
and lower retail gasoline prices.
Two consecutive strong corn crops in the 
US have led to a healthy supply situation. 
During the first half, as the strength of the 
2014/15 harvest became more evident, 
prices for co-products fell, with corn gluten 
meal and corn gluten feed both ending the 
first half at significantly lower prices. During 
the second half, prices were more stable.
Financial performance
Adjusted sales were 17% lower (14% lower  
in constant currency) at £1,786 million  
(2014 – £2,164 million) largely due to the pass 
through of lower corn prices. Volumes 
decreased by 2%. Adjusted operating profit 
was 23% lower (19% lower in constant 
currency) at £133 million (2014 – £172 million) 
as a result of supply chain issues caused by 
the unusually prolonged and severe 2013/14 
winter in the US, and lower EU sugar prices 
which affected bulk sweetener prices in 
Europe. We were also impacted by capacity 
constraints in the wider US transportation 
network. The prior year also included a 
one-off gain of £3.5 million from the on-sale 
of Orsan China (a monosodium glutamate 
producer in which Tate & Lyle previously held 
a stake and which was sold in 2009). The 
effect of currency translation was to decrease 
adjusted operating profit by £7 million.
This division comprises three product 
categories: bulk sweeteners; industrial 
starches, acidulants and ethanol; and 
co-products. 
Bulk sweeteners
In the Americas, bulk corn sweetener volumes 
decreased by 2%. This was due to supply 
constraints driven by the unusually prolonged 
and severe 2013/14 winter in the US which 
caused operational difficulties in our US plants 
and led us to enter the 2015 financial year with 
much lower inventories than usual. Adjusted 
sales decreased by 20% (down 17% in 
constant currency) to £711 million (2014 – 
£889 million) as a result of the lower volumes 
and the significant reduction in corn prices 
following the record corn crop. The supply 
constraints resulted in profits well below the 
prior year. We have increased tolling contracts 
to around 75% of US corn sweetener volumes 
as another vehicle to dampen volatility. 
Contracts in the 2015 calendar year pricing 
round for the remaining 25% of corn 
sweetener volumes were renewed at higher 
unit margins.
Operating profits from Almex, our Mexican 
joint venture, were lower than the 
comparative period reflecting reduced 
volumes and lower margins as a result of 
greater competition from Mexican sugar. 
In Europe, bulk corn sweetener volumes 
increased by 3% while adjusted sales 
declined by 19% (11% in constant currency) 
to £120 million (2014 – £148 million), as lower 
EU sugar pricing (which sets the reference 
price for isoglucose in Europe) and the pass 
through of lower EU corn prices impacted 
sales. Profits for the year were below the 
prior year due to the impact of lower EU 
sugar pricing in the second half.
Industrial starches, acidulants and 
ethanol
Adjusted sales were 14% lower than the 
comparative period (down 12% in constant 
currency) at £543 million (2014 – £635 million).
In industrial starches, volumes were 3% 
lower. In the US, where we contract for 
longer periods than in Europe, profit was 
ahead of the prior year as a result of firmer 
pricing and favourable product mix, more 
than offsetting lower volumes. In Europe, 
lower volumes, reflecting the continued 
diversification of capacity to Speciality Food 
Ingredients along with the pricing pressure 
from increased industry capacity, drove a 
decrease in profits. This business remains 
particularly sensitive to changes in the 
macroeconomic environment.
Profit in our citric acid business was lower 
than the prior year, with reduced volumes 
partially mitigated by higher selling prices. 
The performance of our Bio-PDO
TM
 joint 
venture improved in the year as a result of 
slightly higher volumes and lower corn costs.
In US ethanol, the sharp deterioration in 
margins reduced profits in the second half  
of the year largely offsetting improved 
market conditions and a stronger profit 
performance earlier in the year. Overall 
performance for the year was somewhat 
stronger than the prior year. 
Co-products
Sales of co-products decreased by 16% 
(13% in constant currency) to £412 million 
(2014 – £492 million). Overall returns on 
co-products were broadly in line with our 
expectations at the start of the year.

Five key factors have combined to reduce 
adjusted operating profit by £97 million in 
this financial year. Firstly, on a constant 
currency basis, the adjusted operating profit 
of our SPLENDA
®
 Sucralose business was 
lower by £43 million due principally to price 
erosion in an extremely competitive market. 
The second significant factor was the  
impact of the operational and supply chain 
disruption which led to costs totalling around 
£20 million in the year. These costs exclude 
the impact of lost sales which constrained 
volume growth in Speciality Food 
Ingredients in the year by approximately 
three to four percentage points. Thirdly, 
adjusted operating profit in our Bulk 
Ingredients business in Europe was £13 
million lower than the previous financial year 
as pricing for EU sugar, which provides the 
reference price for isoglucose in Europe fell,

China, a business in which we previously 
held a stake and which was sold in 2009.  
In addition, adjusted operating profit for  
the year ended 31 March 2014 included  
a number of further one-off gains totalling 
£9 million, the largest item of which was  
the profit of £6 million on the purchase,  
sale and leaseback of our Hoffman Estates

£142 million of exceptional costs, primarily 
the £113 million impairment charge in 
respect of the Singapore sucralose plant. 
Profit for the year from total operations 
decreased to £30 million (2014 – £273 
million), with the prior period benefiting from 
an exceptional income tax credit of £28 
million following the favourable resolution  
of outstanding tax matters in Spain. 
Central costs 
Central costs, which include head office, 
treasury and reinsurance activities, 
decreased by £1 million to £35 million.  
One-off costs in the first half of the 2015 
financial year (primarily driven by captive 
insurance costs relating to the impact of the 
Singapore extended shut down) were offset 
by lower share-based payments charges.
Exceptional items from continuing 
operations
During the year the Group recognised  
an exceptional charge of £142 million, 
comprising £12 million of business 
transformation costs associated with 
completing the implementation of the 
common global IS/IT system; £12 million to 
terminate distribution rights previously held 
by a third party to sell our crystalline fructose 
to customers primarily in Asia Pacific; and 
£118 million of costs associated with the 
business re-alignment exercise announced 
on 21 April 2015. Further detail can be found 
in Note 6 to the Group Financial Statements. 
Net finance expense
After excluding net retirement benefit 
interest, adjusted net finance expense  
from continuing operations decreased to 
£23 million (2014 – £27 million) with a 
reduction in underlying net interest expense 
following the repayment of our $500 million 
bond in November 2014.
Taxation
Our tax policy is to manage our obligations 
in compliance with all relevant tax laws, 
disclosure requirements and regulations.  
We seek to ensure that our approach to  
tax and the tax payments we make in all 
territories in which we have operations are 
fully consistent with local requirements, 
taking into account available tax incentives 
and allowances, and are aligned with the 
Group’s wider business strategy. 
We seek to develop good, open working 
relationships with tax authorities and to 
engage with them proactively, recognising 
that tax legislation can be complex and may 
be subject to differing interpretations. In 
instances where this might arise, we seek  
to engage with the relevant tax authorities in 
open discussion of any such differences as 
early as possible to remove uncertainty and 
obtain resolution.
Tate & Lyle’s tax strategy and the 
management of tax risk is primarily the 
responsibility of the Chief Financial Officer 
and the Vice President, Group Tax and it  
is reviewed by the Board and the Audit 
Committee to ensure responsible tax 
practices are maintained across the  
Group’s businesses.
Our tax rate is sensitive to the geographic 
mix of profits and reflects a combination of 
higher rates in certain jurisdictions such as 
the US, nil effective rates in Singapore (due 
to pioneer status which we were granted in 
2008 to reflect our investment in innovative 
technology) and the UK, and rates that lie 
somewhere in between, for example, in 
certain East European countries. The 
adjusted effective tax rate for the year

STRATEGIC REPORT FINANCIAL STATEMENTS GOVERNANCE USEFUL INFORMATION increased to 21.2%. (2014 – 18.5%), driven 
by the geographic mix in profits shifting 
away from lower tax jurisdictions, notably 
Singapore, partially offset by the settlement 
of some outstanding tax issues in the year 
which benefited the headline rate by around 
100 basis points. As a result of the 
continued shift in geographic mix of our 
profits, we anticipate that the effective tax 
rate in the 2016 financial year will be slightly 
above the underlying 2015 rate.
Our UK earnings are now relatively small 
following the sale of our legacy sugars and 
molasses businesses. Less than 1% of our 
total Group sales (2015 – £21 million) are 
derived from UK operations which are offset 
by our corporate costs, primarily the interest 
we pay on our borrowings. As a result, we 
pay no corporation tax in the UK.
Discontinued operations and legacy 
issues
The Group did not report any operations  
as being discontinued during the year ended  
31 March 2015. Continuing operations 
include the results of Eaststarch which is not 
treated as a discontinued operation for the 
financial year ended 31 March 2015.  
During the year ended 31 March 2014, the 
Group recognised a non-cash exceptional 
income tax credit of £28 million following  
the favourable resolution of outstanding  
tax matters associated with the starch 
facilities which formed part of the Group’s 
former Food and Industrial Ingredients, 
Europe segment. 
Earnings per share 
Adjusted diluted earnings per share from 
continuing operations at 37 .7p (2014 – 55.7p) 
were 32% lower (29% in constant currency). 
Adjusted basic earnings per share from 
continuing operations decreased by 33% 
(down 30% in constant currency) to 38.0p. 
Total basic earnings per share decreased to 
6.6p (2014 – 58.8p).
Dividend 
The Board recognises the importance  
of dividends to shareholders and remains 
committed to the dividend policy it 
implemented in 2009. Underpinned by  
the confidence it has in the strategy of the 
business, the Board intends to recommend 
an unchanged final dividend of 19.8p  
(2014 – 19.8p) making a full-year dividend  
of 28.0p (2014 – 27 .6p) per share, an 
increase of 1.4% on the prior year. Subject  
to shareholder approval, the proposed final 
dividend will be due and payable on 31 July 
2015 to all shareholders on the Register  
of Members on 3 July 2015. In addition  
to the cash dividend option, shareholders 
will continue to be offered a Dividend 
Reinvestment Plan (DRIP) alternative. 
Net debt
Net debt increased to £504 million (2014 – 
£353 million). Adjusted free cash flow from 
continuing businesses of £66 million was 
offset by dividend payments of £130 million 
and the repurchase of ordinary shares to 
satisfy the Group’s share option schemes. 
An adverse exchange rate impact increased 
net debt by £46 million (including £7 million 
from joint ventures) principally as a result of 
the stronger US dollar. During the year, net 
debt peaked at £567 million in January 2015 
reflecting the normal seasonal increase in 
payments to farmers in the US. The average 
net debt was £404 million, an increase of 
£32 million from £372 million in the prior year. 
Retirement benefits 
We maintain pension plans for our 
employees in a number of countries. Some 
of these arrangements are defined pension 
schemes and, although we have now closed 
the main UK scheme and the US salaried 
hourly paid schemes to future accrual at 
most locations, certain obligations remain.  
In the US, we also provide medical benefits 
as part of the retirement package.
The net deficit on our retirement benefit  
and health plans increased by £7 million  
to £227 million (2014 – £220 million): the  
net deficit on the Group’s pension plans 
decreased by £8 million; and the liabilities 
associated with unfunded retirement medical 
plans in the US increased by £15 million.
The main UK pension scheme showed a 
reduction in liability of £52 million where the 
impact of a lower discount rate was more 
than offset by the return on assets and 
Company cash contributions. The liability 
associated with the US pension plan 
increased by £42 million with the impact of 
the longer mortality assumptions and lower 
discount rate partially offset by the return  
on assets and Company contributions. 
Other plan liabilities increased by £2 million. 
The liabilities associated with unfunded 
retirement medical plans in the US increased 
by £15 million to £69 million (2014 – £54 
million) due to the adverse effect of exchange 
translation (£6 million), and a decrease in the 
applicable discount rate and higher claims 
experience (£9 million).
Employer contributions in respect of pension 
and post retirement schemes totalled 
£52 million (2014 – £47 million), comprising 
£28 million in respect of the main UK 
schemes, £1 million in respect of the other 
UK schemes, £19 million in respect of US 
pension schemes and £4 million in respect  
of US retirement medical plans. 
As previously announced, the funding 
arrangements in connection with the  
31 March 2013 actuarial valuation for the 
main UK Scheme were agreed with the 
Scheme Trustee during the year. Under  
the new arrangements core funding 
contributions remain at £12 million per year. 
A new secured funding account was 
established, whereby supplementary 
contributions of £6 million per year will be 
made during the first six years, payable to 
the Trustee on certain triggering events  
such as under-performance of the Scheme’s 
investments or a deterioration in the strength 
of Tate & Lyle PLC’s financial covenant. The 
first two annual payments amounting to 
£12 million were credited to the secured 
funding account upon its establishment in 
October 2014 and have been accounted for 
as additional contributions to the Scheme  
in the second half of the year.

STRATEGIC REPORT 
Group Financial Results continued To provide more details on our business performance, in addition to the segmental disclosure required under IFRS (which remains unchanged),  
and given the evolving nature of the business including the changes announced in April, we intend to disclose additional information regarding the 
performance within our operating segments. We believe the revised approach will provide a clearer understanding of the drivers of performance; better 
highlight the impact of commodity volatility on performance; and drive a greater understanding of the sustainable growth potential of the business. 
For Speciality Food Ingredients, we will disclose our business through the major components of SPLENDA
®
 Sucralose, our full Food Systems 
business and the rest of the business. For these, we will disclose volume growth as a percentage, adjusted sales in millions of pounds, and adjusted 
operating profit in £ millions. We will provide additional information on the geographical split of the business excluding Food Systems and SPLENDA
®
 
Sucralose, specifically North America, the combination of Asia Pacific and Latin America, and Europe, Middle East and Africa (EMEA). For these 
geographic regions we will disclose volume growth as a percentage and adjusted sales in £ millions. On the same basis, to provide greater insight 
into the progress we are making on innovation, we will also disclose innovation-related growth within Speciality Food Ingredients. 
For Bulk Ingredients, we will disclose the performance of the division as a single segment, but also provide volume growth for the key North 
American bulk sweetener and North American industrial starches businesses as we believe volume growth rather than sales value is the key metric  
for the business, with sales values being clouded by the pass through of corn costs. We also want to give greater insight into the impact that 
commodities volatility has on this business. We aim to dampen volatility in Bulk Ingredients wherever we can. We actively do this through raw 
material hedging, the use of tolling contracts and decisions on forward co-product sale commitments. As a result, for most of our business we are 
generally able to generate solid cash flows. However, there are some parts of the business, mainly in ethanol and co-product pricing, where our 
ability to dampen volatility is limited and no viable hedging options exist. While we expect conditions in the commodity markets will vary from year  
to year, for these commodities our approach will continue to be to plan for a normal year, and we will provide guidance as the year progresses on  
the expected impact of these commodities on the performance of Bulk Ingredients.
In the new supplementary disclosure framework information for the year ended 31 March 2015, which is presented on a pro-forma basis, Group 
adjusted sales and adjusted operating profit have been reduced by £101 million and £32 million respectively to reflect the pro-forma impact of 
re-alignment of the Eaststarch European joint venture, assuming that the transaction had taken effect from 1 April 2014.

these items into account the adjusted profit before tax for the year ended 31 March 2015 on a consistent basis becomes £208 million

STRATEGIC REPORT FINANCIAL STATEMENTS GOVERNANCE USEFUL INFORMATION
New supplementary disclosure framework and pro-forma adjustment  
for Eaststarch re-alignment Assets 
Gross assets of £2,423 million at 31 March 
2015 were £45 million lower than the prior 
year on a statutory basis, with capital 
expenditure above depreciation and the 
positive impact of the strengthening US 
dollar more than offset by lower levels of 
cash and cash equivalents and the 
impairment of the Singapore sucralose 
facility. Net assets decreased by £114 million 
to £936 million, with profits generated in the 
year being more than offset by dividend 
payments and share re-purchases. 
Cash flow
Adjusted operating cash flow from 
continuing operations was £279 million 
(2014 – £440 million). Working capital was 
broadly flat in the 2015 financial year, as 
higher inventories (driven by an increase in 
finished goods) and higher receivables were 
broadly offset by higher payables. The cash 
flow impact from the Group’s retirement 
benefit plans amounted to £47 million  
(2014 – £43 million).

Capital expenditure of £166 million,

in intangible assets, was 1.5 times the 
depreciation and amortisation charge of 
£113 million. Net interest paid decreased  
by £2 million to £29 million, principally as a 
result of the repayment of our $500 million 
bond in November 2014. Net income  
tax payments were £18 million  
(2014 – £23 million).
Adjusted free cash inflow (representing cash 
generated from continuing operations after 
working capital, interest, taxation, and capital 
expenditure) at £66 million was £161 million 
lower than the prior year largely as a result  
of lower earnings and working capital  
(£5 million outflow from working capital 
versus a £38 million inflow in the prior year).
During the year we spent £12 million on  
the repurchase of ordinary shares to satisfy 
obligations under share option schemes. 
Parent Company cash dividends paid were 
£130 million, £6 million higher than the  
prior year.
Post balance sheet events
On 21 April 2015, the Group announced  
a major business re-alignment to further 
focus on and strengthen our Speciality  
Food Ingredients segment. The re-alignment 
includes the restructuring of our Eaststarch 
European joint venture and steps to  
re-focus and restructure our SPLENDA
®
 
Sucralose business. Further detail and 
pro-forma financial information can be  
found on page 31.
Financial risk factors
Our key financial risk factors are market 
risks, such as foreign exchange, transaction 
and translation exposures, and credit and 
liquidity risks, as explained in Note 20.
Off balance sheet arrangements
In the ordinary course of business, to 
manage our operations and financing, we 
enter into certain performance guarantees 
and commitments for capital and other 
expenditure. The aggregate amount of 
indemnities and other performance 
guarantees, on which no material loss has 
arisen, including those related to joint 
ventures and associates, was £nil million at 
31 March 2015 (2014 – £1 million). We aim  
to optimise financing costs in respect of  
all financing transactions. Where it is 
economically beneficial, we choose to lease 
rather than purchase assets. Leases for 
property, plant and equipment where the 
lessee does not assume substantially all the 
risks and rewards of ownership are treated 
as operating leases, with annual rentals 
charged to the income statement over the 
term of the lease. Commitments under 
operating leases to pay rentals in future years 
totalled £194 million (2014 – £174 million) and 
related primarily to railcar leases in the US. 
Rental charges for the year ended 31 March 
2015 in respect of continuing operations 
were £18 million (2014 – £17 million).
Use and fair value of financial 
instruments 
In the normal course of business we use 
both derivative and non-derivative financial 
instruments. The fair value of Group net 
borrowings at the year end was £528 million 
against a book value of £504 million (2014 – 
fair value £387 million; book value £353 
million). Derivative financial instruments used 
to manage the interest rate and currency of 
borrowings had a fair value of £18 million 
asset (2014 – £29 million asset).
The main types of instrument used are 
interest rate swaps, interest rate options 
(caps or floors), and cross-currency interest 
rate swaps. The fair value of other derivative 
financial instruments hedging future 
currency and commodity transactions was 
£4 million liabilities (2014 – £1 million assets). 
When managing currency exposure, we use 
spot and forward purchases and sales, and 
options. The fair value of other derivative 
financial instruments accounted for as held 
for trading was a £38 million asset (2014 – 
£20 million asset).
Fair value estimation
The fair value of derivative financial 
instruments is based on the market price  
of comparable instruments at the balance 
sheet date if they are publicly traded. The  
fair value of the forward currency contracts 
was determined based on market forward 
exchange rates at the balance sheet date. 
The fair values of short-term deposits, 
receivables, payables, loans and overdrafts 
with a maturity of less than one year are 
assumed to approximate their book values. 
The fair values of bonds, bank and other 
loans, including finance lease liabilities due  
in more than one year, are estimated by 
discounting the future contractual cash flows 
at the current market interest rate available 
to the Group for similar financial instruments, 
adjusted for the fair valuation effects of 
currency and interest rate risk exposures, 
where those instruments form part of related 
hedging relationship agreements, financial 
and commodity forward contracts and 
options, and commodity futures. The values 
of certain items of merchandisable 
agricultural commodities that are included  
in inventories are based on market prices.

STRATEGIC REPORT FINANCIAL STATEMENTS GOVERNANCE USEFUL INFORMATION
Going concern
The Group’s business activities, together  
with the factors likely to affect its future 
development, performance and position are 
set out in this Strategic Report. The financial 
position of the Group, its cash flows, liquidity 
position and borrowing facilities are described 
in the same sections. In addition, Note 20 
includes the Group’s objectives, policies and 
processes for managing capital; financial risk 
management objectives; details of financial 
instruments and hedging activities; and 
exposures to credit risk and liquidity risk.
As set out in the sections and Notes 
referenced above, the market conditions of 
the areas in which the Group operates have 
been affected, and are likely to continue to 
be affected, by large movements in input 
prices. However, with some 70% of revenues 
from food and beverage ingredients, the 
Group has a measure of resilience (although 
not immunity) to economic challenges.  
In addition, the Group has access to 
considerable financial resources through its 
facilities as described in Note 20. In making 
their assessment of the going concern basis, 
the Directors have reviewed the maturities of 
these facilities, the headroom available from 
them and the Group’s ability to meet the 
covenant requirements of certain of them. 
As a consequence, the directors believe that 
the Group is well placed to manage its 
business risks successfully.
After making enquiries, the Directors have  
a reasonable expectation that the Company 
and the Group have adequate resources  
to continue in operational existence for the 
foreseeable future. Accordingly, they 
continue to adopt the going concern basis  
in preparing this Annual Report.
Basis of preparation 
At the beginning of the year, the Group 
adopted IFRS 11 ‘Joint Arrangements’. While 
not affecting the Group’s profit for the year 
or net assets, the adoption has affected a 
number of the individual line items disclosed 
in the Group’s financial statements. 
Previously, the Group had accounted for 
interest in joint ventures on a proportionate 
consolidation basis, whereby the Group’s 
share of the income and expenses, assets 
and liabilities and cash flows of joint ventures 
was combined on a line-by-line basis with 
those of Tate & Lyle PLC and its subsidiaries. 
IFRS 11 prohibits the use of proportionate 
consolidation and requires that joint 
ventures are accounted for using the equity 
method of accounting. Under the equity 
method of accounting, the Group’s share  
of the after-tax profits and losses of the joint 
ventures is shown on a single line of the 
consolidated income statement; its share  
of their net assets is shown on one line of 
the consolidated statement of financial 
position; and the consolidated statement  
of cash flows reflects cash flows between 
the Group and the joint ventures within  
cash flows from investing activities. Trading 
balances with joint ventures and associates 
are included within current payables or 
receivables. Accordingly, the Group has 
restated comparative financial information 
where appropriate. The Group also adopted  
IFRS 12 ‘Disclosures of Interests in Other 
Entities’ at the beginning of the year,  
which stipulates enhanced disclosure 
requirements for non-controlling interests, 
joint ventures, and associates. Enhanced 
disclosure of the Group’s joint-venture 
holdings and associates can be found in 
Note 16 to the Financial Statements. There 
are no material non-controlling interests in 
the Group. 
With the exception of the changes arising 
from the adoption of IFRS 11 and IFRS 12 
the Group’s principal accounting policies are 
unchanged compared with the year ended 
31 March 2014. 
Adjusted performance measures
We report adjusted performance measures 
because they provide both management and 
investors with valuable additional information 
on the performance of the business. The 
Group has presented adjusted financial 
information on a proportionate consolidation 
basis, as this reflects the management of its 
joint ventures on an integrated basis with  
the Group’s subsidiaries, and the basis upon 
which management information is reported 
to the Board (the designated Chief Operating 
Decision Maker). Accordingly, performance 
measures such as adjusted sales, adjusted 
operating profit, adjusted profit before tax 
and adjusted diluted earnings per share are 
unaffected by the adoption of IFRS 11.
In addition to the adjustment for 
proportionate consolidation, the following 
items are excluded from these adjusted 
measures:
• Exceptional items (Note 6) 
• Amortisation of intangible assets acquired 
through business combinations
• Net retirement benefit interest (Note 9)
• Tax on the adjusting items (Note 10)
• Results of discontinued operations  
(Note 11).
This adjusted information is used internally 
for analysing the performance of the 
business. A reconciliation of reported and 
adjusted information is included in Note 41.
Impact of changes in exchange rates
In comparison to the prior year, the Group’s 
reported financial performance was 
adversely affected by currency translation.  
A weakening of the average US dollar and 
euro exchange rates against sterling has 
reduced profits. The movement in period-
end exchange rates, particularly the 
strengthening US dollar, led to an increase  
in net debt as a result of the translation of 
dollar-denominated debt. The average and 
closing exchange rates used to translate 
reported results were as follows: 
Average rates Closing rates
2015 2014 2015 2014
US dollar:sterling 1.61 1.59 1.49 1.67
Euro:sterling 1.28 1.19 1.38 1.21

a number of risks which 
could have a material 
adverse effect on our 
reputation, operations  
and financial performance.
The Board has overall responsibility for the 
Group’s system of risk management and 
internal control. The schedule of matters 
reserved to the Board ensures that the 
Directors control, among other matters,  
all significant strategic, financial and 
organisational risks.
Approach
Annual process to identify risks
The Group-wide risk management and 
reporting process helps us to identify, 
assess, prioritise and mitigate risk. It follows 
the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations 
of the Treadway Commission (COSO) 
Enterprise Risk framework. 
Our process is both bottom-up and 
top-down. The bottom-up aspect of the 
process involves a rolling programme of 
workshops, facilitated by the risk 
management team, held around the Group. 
During these workshops, we identify current 
and forward-looking risks which are collated 
and reported through functional and 
divisional levels to the Group Executive 
Committee. The top-down aspect involves 
the Board assessing what it believes to be 
the key risks facing Tate & Lyle. We combine 
the results of these processes to identify the 
Group’s key business, financial, operational 
and compliance risks, and then develop 
action plans and controls to mitigate them 
as far as possible, to the extent deemed 
appropriate taking account of the Group’s 
risk appetite. These risks are then reviewed 
again by the Board. This process takes 
place annually. As part of this annual risk 
assessment process, the Board also reviews 
emerging and ‘black swan’ risks facing the 
Group. The process reviews risks over a 
time period of between two and five years.
Managing risks
Individual executives in each division are 
assigned responsibility for managing  
key risks and their associated mitigating 
controls. As part of the process, senior 
executive management formally confirms 
once a year that these key risks are being 
managed appropriately within their 
operations and that controls have been 
examined and are effective. The 
confirmations and any exceptions are 
discussed at the Audit Committee and 
Corporate Responsibility Committee, and, 
where appropriate, reported to the Board.
The Board and the Group Executive 
Committee undertake an annual exercise  
to consider the nature and extent of the 
Group’s risk appetite. The results of this 
exercise, which includes a review of how  
the previous year’s risk appetite had been 
applied in practice, are used as part of our 
strategic planning activities, and in setting 
ongoing mitigating actions.
Key risks
Key risks and uncertainties identified as part 
of the risk management process undertaken 
during the year, together with some of the 
mitigating actions we are taking, are set out 
on pages 35 and 36. However, it is not 
possible to identify or anticipate every risk 
that may affect the Group.
The individual risks in relation to the 
operational and supply chain disruption 
which occurred during the year were 
identified as part of the risk management 
process. However, the scale, velocity and 
combination of these risks significantly 
increased their overall impact on the Group. 
As a result, we reviewed our processes and 
made some enhancements, for example, by 
placing a greater focus on those areas and 
behaviours which could potentially trigger 
risk combinations in the future.

Safety
Failure to act safely and to maintain the safe operation  
of our facilities
The safety of our employees, contractors, suppliers, and  
the communities in which we operate is paramount. We must 
operate within local laws, regulations, rules and ordinances relating 
to health, safety and the environment, including emissions. Failure  
to act safely may give rise to fines or penalties for breach of safety 
laws, interruptions in operations or loss of licence to operate, liability 
payments and costs arising from injuries or damage and damage  
to reputation.
• Health and safety policies and procedures at all facilities with  
dedicated staff to ensure they are embedded and measured
• Regular review of performance and policies by the Corporate 
Responsibility Committee
• Maintenance of suitable insurance programme
• Programme of global compliance audits; senior executives also 
undertake annual executive audits at most sites
Following a challenging year, in mid-2014 we hired external safety auditors 
to carry out a thorough audit of safety at all our major locations. This 
allowed us to understand how each site was following our procedures 
and permit systems, and what improvements were needed. During the 
year we began carrying out their recommendations, particularly with 
regards to behavioural safety and leadership by example. This is helping 
our teams improve their understanding of and approach to safety.
Strategy
Failure to grow in speciality food ingredients
Tate & Lyle’s strategy is to become the leading global provider of 
speciality food ingredients and solutions. Our ability to deliver the 
strategy may be affected by a number of factors such as delivering 
growth in emerging markets, acquisitions, customer readiness to 
adopt new ingredients and incorporate them in new product 
launches, competitor actions, and growing key product or product 
families. Failure to deliver our strategy over the longer term would 
negatively affect our credibility, reputation and profitability.
• Investments to increase our sales and technical resources,  
including in emerging markets
• New staff recruited and development of existing staff to upgrade  
skill sets, particularly in customer-facing areas and innovation
• Enhancement of internal capabilities to help promote growth through 
acquisition
• Establishment of a global programme to enhance customer  
account management, planning and execution
Innovation
Failure to innovate and commercialise new products
Failure to identify important consumer trends and provide innovative 
solutions, and the inability to successfully commercialise new 
products, could impact the delivery of our strategy. This would affect 
our performance and reputation.
• Innovation and Commercial Development (ICD) team works closely with 
customers and other external organisations to identify emerging trends
• Open innovation team actively scouts for breakthrough technologies 
and opportunities across industries and universities
• Global Marketing organisation in place to provide support for new 
product launches as well as core business
• Prioritisation of ‘partnership’ opportunities with customers to accelerate 
development cycles and time to market for new ingredients
• Tate & Lyle Ventures invests in early-stage companies in the areas  
of food sciences and technologies by partnering with research 
institutions, other venture funds, universities and entrepreneurs
Quality
Failure to maintain the quality of our products  
and high standards of customer service
The safety of consumers of our products is critical. Poor quality  
or sub-standard products or poor customer service could have a 
negative impact on our reputation and relationships with customers.
• Strict quality control procedures and testing of all product lines to 
ensure products are released only with full quality control clearance
• Quality policies, procedures and performance reviewed regularly  
by the Corporate Responsibility Committee
• Third-party audit programme supplemented by internal global 
compliance audits
• Recall simulation exercises undertaken
People
Failure to attract, develop, engage and retain key personnel
Performance, knowledge and skills of employees are central to our 
success. We must attract, integrate, engage and retain the talent 
required to deliver our strategy, and have the appropriate processes 
and culture in place. Being unable to retain key people and 
adequately plan for succession could have a negative impact  
on the Company’s performance.
• Remuneration policies designed to attract, retain and reward 
employees with ability and experience to execute Group strategy
• Talent development strategy to provide opportunities for employees,  
as well as training to close skill gaps
• Single global performance management system and talent planning 
processes in place
• Greater focus by the Board on succession planning for business-critical 
roles
• Measurement of progress against cultural objectives (for example, 
global employee surveys)

STRATEGIC REPORT FINANCIAL STATEMENTS GOVERNANCE USEFUL INFORMATION Risks How do we manage the risk?
Legal, IS/IT and compliance
Failure to comply with legislation and regulation and to 
protect the integrity of our data and information systems 
We operate in a variety of markets and are therefore exposed  
to a wide range of legal and regulatory frameworks. We must 
understand and comply with all applicable legislation. Any breach 
could have a financial impact and damage our reputation.
• Regular monitoring and review of changes in law and regulation  
in such areas as health and safety, environment, quality, food safety  
and corporate governance
• Legal teams maintain compliance policies in areas such as anti-trust 
and anti-corruption law; and provide ongoing training to employees
• Cyber security enhancement programme in place
Operations
Failure to maintain the continuous operation of our plant 
network and supply chain
The operation of plants involves many risks, which could cause 
temporary or permanent breaks in production. We must have a 
robust sales and operations planning system to avoid disruption  
to the supply chain and an inability to service our customers. Failure  
to do so could have a material adverse effect on our performance.
• Business continuity capabilities in place to enable supply, as quickly  
as practicable, of product to customers from alternative sources in  
the event of a natural disaster or major equipment or plant failure
• Dedicated internal resources allocated to key projects in conjunction 
with business teams to ensure business continuity is not compromised. 
External resources and expertise used where required
• Programme in place to improve global supply chain processes
• New protocols implemented to enhance plants’ ability to operate in 
extreme cold conditions
Raw materials
Fluctuations in prices and availability of raw materials, 
energy, freight and other operating inputs 
Margins may be affected by fluctuations in crop prices due to factors 
such as alternative crops, co-product values and the variability of 
local or regional harvests caused by, for example, weather 
conditions, crop disease, climate change, and crop yields. In some 
cases, due to the basis for pricing in sales contracts, or due to 
competitive markets, we may not be able to pass on to customers 
the full increase in raw material prices or higher energy, freight or 
other operating costs. Additionally, margins may be affected by 
customers not taking expected volumes.
• Strategic relationships with suppliers and trading companies including 
multi-year agreements
• Balanced portfolio of supply and tolling contracts in operation with 
customers to manage balance of raw material prices and product sales 
prices and volume risks
• Raw material and energy purchasing policies to provide security  
of supply
• Expanding network of corn elevators to enhance security of supply
• New or back-up supply sources in place in case primary suppliers face 
localised challenges
• Use of derivatives and forward contracts (where possible) to hedge  
and manage raw materials and co-product price exposures
Food regulation/consumer concerns
Changes in consumer or government perception of our 
products and regulatory risks impacting freedom to operate
Our freedom to operate may be affected by changes in food 
regulation, consumer concerns, political campaigns targeted at 
specific ingredients or technologies or other factors that may impact 
the regulatory status or perception of our products or of their 
functionality, efficacy or use. We must ensure that the science 
behind our ingredients (for example, health claims, nutritional impact, 
biotechnology in crops or other material for food use) is supported 
by credible sources, clearly communicated and understood by 
relevant regulatory authorities. Failure to do so may restrict the 
markets for our products.
• Global regulatory team, supported by external consultants, monitors 
local regulatory requirements affecting our products 
• Global nutrition team initiates and monitors research and publications 
concerning the use and functionality of our ingredients and maintains 
global network of health and nutrition clinicians, academics and experts
• Membership of trade organisations to provide access to broader sources 
of information and to ensure, where appropriate, a single voice for the 
industry on regulatory and public interest issues affecting our ingredients
• Maintenance of relations with regulatory authorities
• Providing clear information on ingredients provenance and traceability 
• Research Advisory Group chaired by a non-executive director 
comprising leading scientific experts to review selected critical aspects 
of the Group’s innovation activities and provide guidance
Finance
Failure to manage the balance sheet, particularly during 
periods of economic uncertainty
We must manage our finances within strictly controlled parameters, 
particularly when external financial conditions are uncertain and 
volatile. Our existing transformation programme consists of a 
number of capital expenditure projects which, if not delivered 
successfully, could negatively affect our performance and reputation.
• Capital expenditure procedures to control and monitor allocation  
and spend
• All new investments evaluated against clear strategic and financial 
criteria; those approved are reviewed for execution against milestones
• External resources and expertise used where required
• Exposure to liquidity risk is managed by maintaining access to a wide 
range of funding sources, and by effective management of our cash 
resources
Finance
Failure to maintain an effective system of internal  
financial controls
Without effective internal financial controls, we could be exposed  
to financial irregularities and losses from acts which could have a 
significant impact on the ability of the business to operate. We must 
safeguard business assets and ensure the accuracy and reliability  
of our records and financial reporting.
• Finance policies and standards are in place supported by procedures 
for key finance processes, for example, capital expenditure
• Finance risk assessments are undertaken and key finance risks 
monitored through the Treasury Risk Committee
• Chief Executive and Chief Financial Officer undertake detailed quarterly 
business and financial reviews
• Additional control oversight, monitoring and processes are introduced 
through periods of significant change, for example, the implementation 
of the new global IS/IT system
• Core controls embedded in systems and processes are routinely 
reviewed for effectiveness, for example, segregation of duties to control 
access rights within Group systems
Shareholder expectations
Failure to manage shareholders’ expectations
We must communicate a clear strategic vision, deliver the annual 
operating plan and provide accurate and timely information to the 
market to enable the investment community to efficiently assess the 
Company’s value, and reduce the risk of uncertainty and volatility  
in the share price. Failure to do so could impact our reputation and 
credibility with shareholders.
• Implementation of new business performance management capability 
and cycle to improve performance management and steer 2016  
Annual Operating Plan delivery
• New forward disclosure framework to improve presentation of  
business results
• Investor Relations team in place with improved communications and 
disclosure framework

Safety
We have no higher priority than safety, for 
our employees and for everyone who comes 
to our sites. Our Executive Safety Steering 
Committee, chaired by our Chief Executive, 
meets throughout the year to review our 
safety performance and improvement 
programmes. Our senior executives 
undertake annual executive safety audits  
at the majority of our sites around the world 
each year.
Our ultimate goal is to have no accidents 
and no injuries. We have undertaken a 
thorough review of our safety management 
programme during the year, including the 
introduction of external auditors to review 
safety management and control at our major 
manufacturing sites. As a result, we have 
overhauled our safety programme and 
accident prevention arrangements at  
Group and site level, as explained below.
Performance
As reported in last year’s Annual Report, 
three contractor employees working at our 
Singapore facility were severely burned 
when performing a steam line break 
procedure in April 2014: two of them later 
died. Then, in June 2014, the site manager 
of one of our grain elevators died when a 
farm utility tractor he was driving overturned. 
We very deeply regret these tragic 
accidents. They have been thoroughly 
investigated, both internally and externally. 
Actions, based on findings, have been taken 
to prevent these types of accidents from 
reoccurring, as explained below.

conduct regular ‘contractor safety summits’, 
to discuss expectations and share best 
practice with contractors, and to support  
our plant-level contractor safety programme.

overhauling our  
safety programme?
Current key initiatives include:
• Global implementation of the 
‘SafeStart’ training programme
• Elimination and engineering out  
of hazards
• Reinforcing administrative controls 
(for example, Permits to Work for 
higher risk activities)
• Improving behavioural safety and  
a strong safety culture
• Contractor safety programme
• Ergonomics, manual handling and 
hand safety initiatives.

Tate & Lyle
Taking action to prevent accidents
Early in 2014 we analysed 10 years of safety 
data. This analysis indicated that 47% of  
our serious incidents were related to working 
at height. Therefore, we implemented a fall 
prevention/protection campaign across  
all sites, using external experts on the 
‘hierarchy of safety controls’ to address 
hazards and prevent incidents, and installed 
new equipment to make it safer to work at 
height. For example, we replaced barrier 
chains with self-closing gates; installed 
platforms instead of using ladders and 
scaffolding; and installed pedestrian 
barricades/anchorage points near potential 
floor and wall openings.
During the year, we appointed external 
auditors to carry out a thorough review of 
our safety systems and procedures at our 
major manufacturing sites. This has been 
very helpful in identifying improvements both 
at global and site level. Overall, the auditors 
concluded that Tate & Lyle does have a 
good safety management programme, and 
that people generally know what is expected 
of them; whilst key areas on which to focus 
for ongoing improvement were identified  
as eliminating and engineering out hazards, 
ensuring the safe design of process 
equipment and improving behavioural 
safety. Below we report on some of the 
actions we have taken so far in these areas.
Eliminating and engineering out hazards 
Looking for ways to eliminate and engineer 
out hazards – so preventing accidents before 
they occur – is a key area of activity, and we 
used external experts to improve our 
understanding of ‘prevention through design’ 
– for example, by removing hazards before 
new equipment is installed. We reviewed  
and updated our minimum standards on 
equipment safety and communicated these 
to all sites, and launched a ‘Lifesaver’ 
campaign to eliminate hazards of severe 
injury. We also looked at vehicle safety, and 
have implemented an on-site vehicle safety 
programme globally, including with our 
contractors, based on the US Occupational 
Safety & Health Administration (OSHA) 
standard for powered industrial trucks. 
Ensuring the safe condition and design 
of process equipment
We work hard to ensure that all equipment  
is checked thoroughly through preventative 
maintenance programmes and periodic  
risk assessments. We carry out internal  
risk assessments on driers and storage 
systems, and integrity checks on concrete 
silos, tall structures and other process 
equipment. We also brought in external 
trainers to help us with mechanical integrity, 
combustible dust, flammable liquids and 
vapours, static electricity hazards, 
hazardous area classifications, and process 
safety management.
Behavioural safety and safety culture
How people behave each and every day  
is at the heart of staying safe. Many of our 
plants had previously been trained on the 
‘SafeStart’ (www.safestart.com) behavioural 
safety programme, and we have been 
holding refresher training and also 
introducing the programme at those sites 
not previously covered. We also developed  
a ‘PAR’ campaign, communicating that 
everyone has the ‘permission, ability and 
responsibility’ to act by stopping operations 
and processes if they see an unsafe act or 
condition. Using these two programmes,  
we reinforced the importance of conducting 
thorough pre-job hazard assessments.
Occupational health and well-being
We contract with external occupational 
health professionals to monitor and 
safeguard the health of employees at work, 
and to provide information, advice and 
support to them on general health and 
wellness matters.
Relationship with employees
We believe in equal opportunities for all, 
regardless of gender, sexual orientation, 
age, marital status, disability, race, religion  
or other beliefs and ethnic or national origin. 
Our policies, practices and procedures  
for recruitment, training and career 
development promote equality of opportunity. 
We are committed to treating people with 
disabilities fairly in all respects, including 
regarding applications, training, promotion 
and career development. An employee who 
becomes disabled would, where appropriate, 
be offered retraining for a more suitable role.
Diversity and inclusion
We believe in a culture where all employees 
contribute to the performance of the Group 
and have the opportunity to develop fully 
according to their individual abilities. We aim 
to attract a diverse workforce that reflects 
the communities in which we operate. Our 
Diversity and Inclusion Council works on 
creating awareness of diversity and inclusion 
issues, tracking inclusion metrics, and 
championing our diversity and inclusion 
programme across the Group.

STRATEGIC REPORT FINANCIAL STATEMENTS GOVERNANCE USEFUL INFORMATION Progress during the year included:
• Appointment of two women to the Group’s 
Executive Committee
• Establishing Employee Resource Groups 
across five different areas of interest; and 
providing platforms for employees to 
support and celebrate our unique 
strengths
• Enhanced cultural diversity from the 
acquisition of Winway Biotechnology, the 
Chinese manufacturer of polydextrose and 
the formation of Tate & Lyle Gemacom 
Tech in Brazil
• Further embedding diversity and inclusion 
into our recruitment practices.
Employee engagement
We believe that employees who are 
committed to Tate & Lyle, our goals, Values 
and strategy, and to each other, are happier 
and ultimately deliver better results. 
Good internal communication is essential to 
this. We communicate with our employees in 
a number of ways, from Group-wide media 
including our intranet and our quarterly 
employee magazine which is published in  
13 languages, to face-to-face dialogue such 
as site-wide meetings, functional meetings 
and small group or team meetings. 
We continue to invest in helping employees 
and managers stay up to date with the latest 
requirements of their roles. Courses provided 
during the year included a supervisors’ 
development programme, a people 
management development programme, 
stakeholder management and influencing, 
and sales training. A significant amount of 
training was provided to further embed our 
performance management principles and 
our refreshed employee induction process.

Environment 
We aim to operate our business with  
a strong regard for environmental 
sustainability. By using resources such  
as energy and water more efficiently, and 
reducing waste, we seek to improve our 
environmental sustainability while also 
controlling operating costs. We work to 
address environmental considerations 
across the life-cycle of our products, from 
our agricultural supply chain to how our 
products are packaged and transported.
Implementing our strategy, by growing  
our Speciality Food Ingredients business,  
is gradually changing the shape of our 
manufacturing operations. We are 
producing more speciality products which 
involve additional manufacturing steps 
compared with Bulk Ingredients products, 
and this generally means using more energy 
and water resources and producing more 
waste. We are working to mitigate this 
through continual improvements in resource 
and operational efficiency, and waste 
reduction programmes.
Policy and standards
Our environmental policy and standards 
apply to all our activities globally and we aim 
to integrate environmental considerations 
into all major decisions. We review our 
environmental policy annually and undertake 
communication and awareness across the 
Group, including through induction and 
other training at our manufacturing facilities. 
Our policy is available on our corporate 
website www.tateandlyle.com.
Our facilities operate under local 
environmental authorisations and permits 
and we require strict compliance with these 
at all times. If a site breaches an operating 
limit, we seek to take steps immediately to 
resolve the issue and prevent reoccurrence.
Our internal global compliance audit 
programme confirms conformity with our 
environmental and food safety, quality and 
health and safety management standards. 
Additionally, our rolling programme of 
external, independent environmental 
compliance audits assures compliance  
with regulatory requirements.
Within our own operations and joint ventures, 
we focus on those aspects of our activities  
that have the greatest potential impact on  
the environment, namely the use of energy 
(and consequent air emissions and carbon 
footprint), water use, and waste management.
Beyond our own operations we focus our 
attention on our agricultural raw material and 
ingredient supply chain, the transportation 
of our products to our customers, and our 
product packaging.

Corporate Responsibility continued
STRATEGIC REPORT Operational performance
Our biggest challenge is that our strategy 
– to grow our Speciality Food Ingredients 
business – means producing a greater 
proportion of speciality ingredients, which 
are generally more resource-intensive to 
manufacture than bulk ingredients. We are 
working therefore on capital projects and 
operational practices that will help us control 
this in terms of our direct environmental 
performance; whilst also working on 
transport and packaging, and sustainable 
agriculture in our supply chain.
Energy use and carbon emissions
In calendar year 2014, compared with 2013, 
energy use per tonne of production was flat. 
Since 2008 we have reduced energy use 
per tonne of production by 6%. Our carbon 
footprint from energy use reduced slightly 
(down 0.3%) per tonne of production in 
2014. Since 2008 we have reduced CO 2e 
emissions per tonne of production by 10%.
Group greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions for 
the period 1 January to 31 December 2014 
in tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent 
(tCO 2e) were:
• From combustion of fuel and operation  
of facilities (Scope 1) – 2,266,975 tCO 2e
2 
(2013 – 2,291,999
1
)
• From electricity, heat, steam and cooling 
purchased (Scope 2) – 1,247 ,700 tCO 2e
2 
(2013 – 1,213,099
1
)
• In total (Scope 1 and 2) – 3,514,675 tCO 2e
2
 
(2013 – 3,505,098
1
) which equates to an 
intensity of 0.375 tCO 2e
2
 (2013 – 0.376
1
) 
per tonne of production.
Environmental sustainability targets and achievements
We have four medium-term environmental sustainability targets.
Target by end of 2016 Calendar year 2014 status Examples
Reduce CO 2e emissions 
from energy use by 12.5% per 
tonne of production (baseline 
year 2008)
1
10% reduction in CO 2e emissions 
per tonne of production versus 
2008
In October 2014 our Sagamore plant in Lafayette, US changed from 
coal to gas, to fuel its combined heat and power (CHP) energy 
system; thereby reducing CO 2e emissions by up to 56,000 tonnes 
per year.
Implement packaging 
reduction programmes with 
customers representing >50% 
of sales (£)
Programmes initiated with 
customers representing >35%  
of sales (£)
Recent projects include changing from shrink wrap to stretch wrap 
to secure pallet loads at a Food Systems manufacturing facility in 
Europe, reducing their wrapping film use by about 75%; and moving 
additional product sacks from bleached to unbleached paper stock.
Implement transport 
efficiency programmes with 
customers representing >50% 
of sales (£)
Programmes initiated with 
customers representing >35%  
of sales (£)
We have implemented several projects shifting regional product 
distribution from road to rail in the US.
Implement sustainable 
agricultural sourcing 
programmes for our top 20 
agricultural raw materials and 
ingredients by volume
We are on track to surpass our 
sustainable agriculture target, 
with programmes currently being 
implemented for 24 agricultural 
raw materials/ingredients (see 
Our Marketplace section for  
more details)
Corn is by far our largest agricultural raw material/ingredient by 
volume. We buy corn from the ‘corn belts’ of the US and Europe.  
We are engaging with the US National Corn Growers Association 
(NCGA), with other growers’ representatives, and with corn growers 
directly, on sustainable agriculture – alongside other matters such as 
food safety and quality.
1 We recognise that installing new air emissions control equipment at several locations over the next few years, and the manufacture of more speciality products, 
will make it more challenging to reduce our energy use and CO 2e emissions in the medium term.

STRATEGIC REPORT FINANCIAL STATEMENTS GOVERNANCE USEFUL INFORMATION During 2014, we saw a significant increase in 
interest from customers around two of these 
areas in particular, in terms of how we can 
help them meet their own objectives and 
targets on sustainable agriculture, and our 
use of the Sedex (www.sedexglobal.com) 
ethical compliance platform within our own 
business and our supply chain.
Product safety, quality and 
sustainability
Our products adhere to the highest 
standards of food safety, quality and 
traceability. Each year, all of our 
manufacturing facilities are externally 
certified to the Global Food Safety Initiative, 
and the international quality standard 
ISO 9000, and we have well-established 
global processes and procedures to ensure 
that we comply with these standards. Our 
control arrangements include: in-process 
testing; our global compliance audit 
programme; annual product traceability and 
recall testing, both globally and locally at 
each facility; and independent food safety 
audits of every manufacturing site.
We consider sustainability criteria in the 
development of new products, and use a 
sustainability evaluation tool as part of our 
innovation pipeline to: 
• Identify any potential sustainability 
concerns early in the product 
development process 
• Evaluate sustainability issues as product 
development progresses, to avoid or 
reduce any potential adverse impacts 
such as the use of energy and non-
renewable resources, and to leverage 
positive impacts such as health and 
wellness benefits.
Our aim is to help our customers provide 
consumers with healthy, nutritious foods 
and beverages as part of a normal balanced 
diet. We aim to ensure that our ingredients, 
and any claims we make regarding their 
benefits or efficacy, are supported by clear, 
demonstrated science. 
In line with our strategy, we focus particularly 
on growing our Speciality Food Ingredients 
division, and as such the majority of our new 
product development is in this area. Many of 
our speciality sweeteners and fibres improve 
stability, thereby helping to extend consumer 
product shelf life and assist in avoiding food 
waste, which is an important food industry 
sustainability issue. Our platforms deliver 
innovative ingredients with substantiated 
health benefits to customers worldwide.  
For example, DOLCIA PRIMA
TM
 Allulose, a 
new product we launched in February 2015, 
is a monosaccharide (simple sugar) found  
in nature and made from corn, and has  
90% fewer calories than, and is 70% as 
sweet as sucrose (normal table sugar),  
but tastes just like it. 
Sustainable agriculture
Our products are derived from agricultural 
raw materials, principally corn, and it is 
important that we have a robust, sustainable 
supply chain. In 2012 we announced a 
sustainable agriculture target, to implement 
sustainable agricultural sourcing 
programmes for our top 20 agricultural raw 
materials/ingredients by volume, by the end 
of 2016. We are on track to surpass this 
target, with programmes currently being 
implemented for 24 agricultural raw 
materials/ingredients.
Our programme has five steps:
1.  Initial sustainability (social, environmental 
and economic) risk assessment for each 
of our agricultural raw materials/
ingredients
2.  Requests to individual suppliers for 
ingredient-specific information on social, 
ethical and environmental matters, 
standards and certifications
3.  Follow-up discussions with suppliers on 
their responses
4.  Establishing sustainable sourcing criteria 
for each material/ingredient
5.  Monitoring of compliance against the 
agreed criteria; whilst seeking continuous 
improvement in management, reporting 
and performance.
Our customers are increasingly interested  
in this area, and we are working closely with 
several key customers to support them in 
their own targets and ambitions around 
sustainable agriculture.
In 2014 we joined Field to Market  
(www.fieldtomarket.org), the US alliance  
for sustainable agriculture, to help define, 
measure and advance sustainability in US 
agriculture, particularly with regard to corn. 
Conduct of commercial relationships
We are committed to ensuring a safe, open 
and responsible culture in all our business 
dealings wherever we operate, in line with 
our Code of Ethics (our Code), and we 
expect the same standards of our business 
partners and suppliers as we do of our own 
employees. Our Code is made available  
in 13 languages and is communicated 
internally via our intranet, through local 
‘Ethics and Values Ambassadors’ across  
the business, and via training programmes. 
Externally, we require all our suppliers and 
business partners to comply with the 
standards set out in the Code. 
We have reported on all of the material 
emission sources required under The 
Companies Act 2006 (Strategic Report  
and Directors’ Report) Regulations 2013.  
We report GHG emissions in line with the 
GHG Protocol Corporate Accounting and 
Reporting Standard. The scope, principles 
and methodologies we use in reporting  
CR performance are provided in ‘CR 
Reporting Criteria Annual Report 2015’  
at www.tateandlyle.com/CR2015.
Water use
Water use per tonne of production increased 
by 3.8% in 2014, due to the increased 
production of speciality ingredients, and 
one-off site-specific factors such as the 
replacement of a cooling tower at our 
Decatur, US facility, which caused a 
significant but temporary increase in water 
use. Since 2008 we have reduced water use 
per tonne of production by 2%. During the 
year, new water re-use and recycling projects 
were implemented across many of our sites, 
including Dayton and McIntosh, US.
Waste to landfill
Our waste to landfill increased significantly 
by 21% per tonne of production in 2014. This 
was due to a number of factors, including: 
process changes at our Decatur, US facility 
that, whilst improving the operational 
efficiency of process equipment, led to a 
significant increase in the volume of inert 
waste going to landfill; severe winter 
conditions in the first quarter of 2014 that 
disrupted our waste water treatment plant at 
Lafayette Sagamore, US; and construction 
waste being created by expansion work at 
several sites including Loudon and 
Sagamore, US. Since 2008 we have 
reduced waste to landfill per tonne of 
production by 8%.
Marketplace
The food and beverage industry is our 
largest market sector and accounts for 70% 
of Group sales. Other industry sectors we 
sell into include industrial, animal feed and 
personal care. 
Over the last few years, stakeholders such 
as customers and investors have been 
looking for increasing volumes of information 
around sustainability and corporate 
responsibility matters. In 2013, we carried 
out a review with the help of an independent 
consultant to confirm our understanding  
of the CR issues of most interest to our 
stakeholders. The most important issues  
for external stakeholders are: the safety, 
integrity and functionality of our products; 
the sustainability of our agricultural raw 
materials/ingredients; and the CR standards 
within our own business and supply chain.

Corporate Responsibility continued
STRATEGIC REPORT Community 
We have a strong history of community 
involvement and during the year we 
continued to support communities both 
local to our operations and globally. 
Our approach
For Tate & Lyle, community involvement  
is about having a positive and lasting 
relationship with the community: changing 
lives for the better. We focus on three 
specific areas:
• Well-being: to provide practical assistance 
in the area of well-being from health issues 
including nutrition through to general 
welfare, such as supporting food banks 
• Education: to develop young people’s 
knowledge and understanding of science, 
technology, engineering and mathematics 
(STEM subjects), and their preparedness 
for a career in a STEM-based discipline, 
either academically or vocationally
• Environment: to promote environmental 
sustainability and good environmental 
management, addressing issues of 
climate change, natural resources and 
conservation.
Overview of the year
In the year ended 31 March 2015, charitable 
donations were £435,000 (2014 – £501,000).
Local programmes/partnerships
We seek to engage with local communities 
where our principal facilities are located. 
Employees at each location can make their 
own decisions as to the specific projects 
they support and the partnerships that they 
develop. As a result, we support a range of 
initiatives and organisations in our local 
communities worldwide.
• Well-being: we supported a wide variety 
of well-being initiatives this year, including: 
child community care centres in 
Johannesburg, South Africa; and local 
hospices, healthcare and food aid 
charities in Europe and the US.
• Education: this year, support provided, 
included enhanced maths and science 
delivery in the Decatur, Lafayette, Loudon 
and McIntosh school districts in the US; 
road safety events for children near Mold, 
UK for the second year running; and, 
bursary/scholarship funds to help students 
access higher education.
• Environment: this year we supported  
a number of environmental initiatives, 
including improvement works to local park 
and conservation areas, and the provision 
of a rejuvenated local parking and 
community information area in Koog, 
Netherlands.
Global partnerships
We have further developed our global 
partnership programmes during the year.
• Well-being: for the third year running,  
we have supported the homeless charity 
Crisis (www.crisis.org.uk) in the UK  
and the Northern Illinois Food Bank  
(www.solvehungertoday.org) in the US. 
Both organisations provide immediate, 
practical assistance to those in need.
• Education: we are progressing 
development of a wider bursary/
scholarship programme across selected 
universities internationally, assisting 
undergraduates to access courses in 
STEM disciplines. This year we provided 
the first four (of eight) fellowships to 
University leaders in Vietnam, building 
capacity in higher education by increasing 
skills in educational leadership and 
governance. We also provided bursaries/
scholarships to the University of Illinois, 
Purdue University and Richland 
Community College, US; and, ran a US 
National Merit scholarship programme.
• Environment: we are entering our  
third year as a corporate partner  
of the environmental research and  
engagement charity Earthwatch  
(www.eu.earthwatch.org), with whom  
we are working on the ecology, 
conservation and sustainable  
harvesting of seaweed in Asia.

Our Code is supported by a set of Standards 
on particular subjects, and this year we 
carried out a review and updated several  
of these, including the Group Competition 
(Anti-trust) Standard, the Group Gifts and 
Hospitality Standard, and the Group 
Standard on the Engagement of Agents and 
Payment of Commissions. We also carried 
out ‘train-the-trainer’ meetings for our local 
Ethics and Values Ambassadors in the US 
and in Europe, Middle East and Africa, to 
enable them to help their colleagues uphold 
the Code both internally and with our 
business partners and suppliers. 
Standards in our supply chain
We communicate our Code to our suppliers 
through our contracts and other 
engagement with them. Our purchase 
contract terms and conditions include the 
requirement that suppliers comply with the 
standards set out in our Code, and that they 
should require similar standards from their 
own suppliers. Specifically, suppliers must 
uphold international business standards and 
be fully compliant with all applicable laws 
and regulations, including but not limited to 
those regarding freedom of association and 
collective bargaining, non-discrimination, 
anti-corruption/anti-bribery, and the 
prevention of child or forced labour.
Our procurement function has a process to 
assesses the environmental, social and 
governance risks of suppliers based on their 
source country (where independent ratings 
of human rights risk are applied), and the 
item itself being supplied (with reference to 
an external sustainability risk assessment  
of our agricultural raw materials/ingredients). 
As set out above, our sustainable agriculture 
programme specifically addresses these 
issues in our agricultural raw materials/
ingredient supply chain (see page 42). 
In addition, having used the Sedex social 
and ethical compliance system  
(www.sedexglobal.com) across our own 
manufacturing facilities for almost 10 years, 
we are now using it with our suppliers as 
one of the tools to promote and assure  
good practices.
Reporting concerns
We encourage our employees and  
business partners to come forward with  
any information concerning actual or  
alleged breaches of our Code. We provide 
an independent, anonymous third-party 
reporting service through free phone 
numbers in 47 countries and by email.  
We promote this ‘Speak Up’ service across 
the Group, and externally via our corporate 
website. Any issues reported are 
investigated by members of our Speak Up 
Committee (see page 52).

We regularly review the Board’s areas of 
focus. The key areas to which we will 
continue to devote significant time at Board 
and Committee level are as follows:
• Safety, including the ongoing 
implementation of initiatives to improve 
hazard identification and accident 
prevention at all our sites
• The implementation of the new planning 
and forecasting system
• The execution of action plans relating  
to the restructuring of our SPLENDA
®
 
Sucralose business and the re-alignment  
of our Eaststarch European joint venture
• The performance of the Speciality Food 
Ingredients and Bulk Ingredients divisions
• Communications with shareholders, 
employees, customers and other 
stakeholders
• Talent management, senior recruitment 
and succession planning activities 
• The Group’s innovation pipeline.
I look forward to meeting shareholders  
at our forthcoming AGM.
Sir Peter Gershon 
Chairman
Dear shareholder
As discussed in this Annual Report,  
Tate & Lyle has faced a number of challenges 
in our operations and our business 
environment which have significantly 
impacted on our performance over the 
course of the past year. 
We have discussed our individual and 
collective learnings from this experience  
and have implemented actions to address 
the issues that have arisen over the year.
Board effectiveness review
Following on from the 2014 review which 
was facilitated by Schneider Ross, the 
Board agreed that the 2015 review should 
be facilitated by our Senior Independent 
Director, Liz Airey. The review identified  
a number of improvements that could be 
made to how we manage ourselves as a 
Board during times of turbulence in our 
business environment and change within  
the organisation itself. Further details are 
contained in the section on the Board 
effectiveness review on page 49.

The Board
The role of the Board
The Board is collectively responsible for

for providing entrepreneurial leadership within 
a framework of prudent and effective controls 
that enable risk to be assessed and 
managed. It sets the Company’s objectives, 
ensures that the Company has the necessary 
financial resources and people to meet them, 
and reviews management’s performance. 
The Board also sets the Company’s Values 
and ensures that its obligations to 
shareholders and others are met. 
There is a schedule of matters reserved  
to the Board for decision, which includes 
approval of:
• Group strategy
• Annual budget and operating plans
• Major capital expenditure, acquisitions  
or divestments
• Interim dividends
• Full-year and half-year results
• Board and Company Secretary 
appointments
• Senior management structure and 
responsibilities
• Treasury policies
• Directors’ conflicts of interest
• Systems of internal control and risk 
management.
Board committees
The Board has delegated certain 
responsibilities to committees, details of 
which can be found on pages 53 to 57  
and on page 70.
Research Advisory Group
The Research Advisory Group (RAG) is 
chaired by Dr Ajai Puri and comprises 
external subject matter experts and senior 
Tate & Lyle managers. The RAG’s remit 
covers reviewing the innovation pipeline  
and providing insight into how leading-edge 
science and technology can be applied  
to enhance the Group’s speciality food 
ingredients portfolio. The RAG meets 
regularly, principally at the global Commercial 
and Food Innovation Centre in Chicago,  
USA and Dr Puri provides regular updates  
to the Board on the work of the RAG.
Operation of the Board
Board meetings
The Board and its Committees meet 
regularly according to a schedule linked  
to key events in the Company’s corporate 
calendar. Ad hoc meetings are also arranged 
to consider matters requiring review and 
decision outside the scheduled meetings. 
Six scheduled Board meetings were held 
during the year ended 31 March 2015, 
including one held at the global Commercial 
and Food Innovation Centre in Chicago, 
USA. Three additional Board meetings were 
also held to consider proposals relating  
to the Group’s business transformation 
programme and to review business 
performance and the impact of changes  
in the business environment on the Group’s 
performance. The Board also met on one 
other occasion during the year under review 
to focus on strategy. It has also met twice 
since the end of the financial year and prior 
to the signing of this Annual Report.
The rolling programme of items for 
discussion by the Board is reviewed at each 
Board meeting and updated to reflect 
topical matters. All substantive agenda items 
have comprehensive briefing papers which 
are distributed via the electronic Board 
portal, generally five working days before  
the meeting. In the few instances where a 
director is unable to attend a meeting, his  
or her comments on the briefing papers  
are given in advance to the Chairman.
Meetings are structured to facilitate open 
debate, and all directors participate in 
discussing safety, strategy, trading, financial 
performance and risk management. 
Members of executive management attend 
Board meetings and regularly make 
presentations. 
The Chairman continued to hold a short 
discussion with the non-executive directors 
collectively both immediately before and 
after each scheduled Board meeting.

Division of responsibilities
The roles of the Chairman, Chief Executive 
and Senior Independent Director are 
separated and their responsibilities are set 
out in writing and agreed by the Board.
The Chairman
Key responsibilities include:
• The effective operation, leadership and 
governance of the Board
• Ensuring the effectiveness of the Board, 
and each director individually
• Setting the style and tone of Board 
discussions
• Ensuring the directors receive accurate, 
timely and clear information.
The Chief Executive
Key responsibilities include:
• Proposing strategy to the Board and 
delivering it
• Running the business
• Communicating the Board’s expectations 
with regard to culture, values and 
behaviours
• Ensuring the Board is aware of the 
executive directors’ views on business 
issues.
The Senior Independent Director
Key responsibilities include:
• Acting as a sounding board for the 
Chairman
• Conducting an annual review of the 
Chairman’s performance
• Being available to shareholders if they 
have any concerns that they have been 
unable to resolve through the normal 
channels.
Board effectiveness
Board diversity
As set out in the Board’s statement on 
diversity, published on the Group’s website, 
the Directors believe that Board composition 
is a key element of Board effectiveness and 
each member, and potential member, of  
the Board must be able to demonstrate the 
skills, experience and knowledge required 
to contribute to the effectiveness of the 
Board. Subject to that overriding principle, 
the Directors believe that the Board’s 
perspective and approach can be greatly 
enhanced through gender, age and cultural 
diversity. It is the Board’s policy to consider 
overall Board balance and diversity when 
appointing new directors.
Board composition
At the date of this Annual Report, the Board 
comprised ten directors with deep 
knowledge and experience in diverse 
business sectors within global markets: the 
Chairman, who has no executive 
responsibilities; two executive directors; and 
seven non-executive directors. The names 
and biographies of the directors are on 
pages 44 and 45.
Independence
With the exception of the Chairman, who  
is presumed under the Code not to be 
independent, the Board considers all the 
non-executive directors to be independent. 
The Senior Independent Director, Liz Airey, 
is available to shareholders if they have any 
issues or concerns which they have not 
resolved through the usual channels, and 
leads the annual review of the Chairman’s 
performance.
The non-executive directors have a wide 
range of skills and knowledge and combine 
broad business and commercial experience 
with independent and objective judgement. 
The terms and conditions of appointment  
of the non-executive directors can be 
inspected at the Company’s registered 
office and will be available for inspection  
at the Annual General Meeting (AGM). 
As part of the annual Board effectiveness 
review, each director goes through a formal 
performance review process. All directors 
completed this process during the year and, 
in line with the Code, Sir Peter Gershon and 
Liz Airey, who have served for over six years, 
have been subject to a particularly rigorous 
review.
Time commitment
All directors have disclosed any significant 
external commitments to the Board and 
confirmed that they continue to have 
sufficient time to discharge their duties  
to Tate & Lyle. The other significant 
commitments of the Directors are set out on 
pages 44 and 45. The time commitment of 
all non-executive directors and the Chairman 
is reviewed annually and the Board is 
comfortable that all Directors continue to 
devote the necessary time to the Company.
Advice and support
The appointment and removal of the 
Company Secretary is a matter for the 
Board as a whole. All directors have access 
to the advice and services of the Company 
Secretary, Lucie Gilbert, who is responsible 
for ensuring that Board processes are 
followed and that applicable rules and 
regulations are complied with. 
There is also a formal procedure whereby 
directors can obtain independent 
professional advice, if necessary, at the 
Company’s expense.
Information and professional 
development
The Chairman, assisted by the Company 
Secretary, is responsible for ensuring that 
the directors receive accurate, timely and 
clear information on all relevant matters. 
Directors receive ongoing training and 
updates on relevant issues as appropriate, 
taking into account their individual 
qualifications and experience. The Company 
Secretary helps directors undertake any 
other professional development they 
48 | Tate & Lyle PLC | Annual Report 2015
GOVERNANCE
Corporate Governance continued consider necessary to assist them in 
carrying out their duties. Visits to external 
events are also arranged to help non-
executive directors in particular to gain a 
deeper insight into the Group’s operating 
environment. During the year, in addition to 
the Board’s visit to Chicago, the Chairman 
and the non-executive directors visited five 
of the Group’s sites in Europe and the US  
as part of their independent site visit 
programme. These visits provide directors 
with the opportunity to interact with local 
management and gain in-depth knowledge 
about the challenges being faced by the 
Group’s operations across the world. Over 
the past three years, the Chairman and 
non-executive directors have visited 20  
of the Group’s principal locations as part  
of this programme.
Directors’ induction programme
Two new directors joined the Board during 
the financial year, Nick Hampton, Chief 
Financial Officer, and Paul Forman, 
non-executive director. On appointment to 
the Board, each of the directors received 
background reading about the Group and 
details of Board procedures and other 
matters related to governance. The Company 
Secretary then worked with Paul Forman to 
deliver a tailored induction programme, and 
the VP , Global Talent worked with Nick 
Hampton to develop and implement an 
appropriate induction programme reflecting 
his executive responsibilities.
Director Aim of induction programme Details of programme
Paul Forman  
Non-executive director
To increase Paul’s knowledge of the Group’s 
business, processes and its people.
Paul visited the global Commercial and Food Innovation 
Centre in Chicago, USA, the Group’s plants in Lafayette, 
Indiana, and the London head office where he met with 
senior operational management and key functional heads.
Nick Hampton
Chief Financial Officer
To accelerate Nick’s transition into the CFO role 
and to increase his understanding of the Group’s 
business and operations, in particular the global 
finance team and support functions.
Nick met with the external auditors, external advisers and 
Group lawyers. He has also visited the Global Commercial 
and Food Innovation Centre in Chicago, USA, and group 
sites in the US, Brazil, Germany and Poland.
Performance evaluation
A review of the Board’s effectiveness is undertaken each year. The process is conducted by an external facilitator at least every third year 
and internally in the intervening years. In 2013, the process was led by the Chairman and in 2014 by an external facilitator, Schneider Ross. 
For the 2015 review, the Board decided that the Senior Independent Director, Liz Airey, should facilitate an internal review, supported by the 
Company Secretary, Lucie Gilbert. The objective was to introduce a fresh approach and a new perspective.
2014 Board effectiveness review
The actions undertaken after the 2014 Board effectiveness review are set out below.
Recommendations Actions taken
Board dynamics
• Chief Executive to meet with executives who attend 
Board meetings immediately afterwards to discuss 
how the Board operated as a whole and to reflect  
on any learnings
• Thinking styles of candidates for the Board and 
Executive Committee to be taken into consideration 
once skill set and experience have been confirmed
• Undertake an externally-facilitated session for the 
Board focusing on boardroom dynamics, relationships 
and how to make even better use of Board diversity
• The practice of a post-meeting review with executive attendees is now well 
embedded and feedback is provided to the Chairman via the Chief Executive. 
• The Nominations Committee considered the need for diversity of thinking 
styles when leading the process which led to the appointment of Paul 
Forman as a director
• In March 2015, all Directors participated in a project to review and build upon 
the diversity of thinking and behavioural styles across the Board. See page 
50 for more details 
Board specifics
• Building on the progress made in 2013, further 
proposals to be developed to drive customer-
centricity in the boardroom
• Board Committees to oversee the executive focus  
on building an inclusive culture
• Revisit the timing and location of the scheduled Board 
meetings, in particular the timing of the annual Board 
strategy day
• The Board’s insights into customers’ perceptions, needs and behaviours 
continued to evolve during the year with interactions with customer-facing 
managers within and outside formal Board meetings. The Board also met 
with representatives from a major customer during its visit to the global 
Commercial and Food Innovation Centre in Chicago, USA
• The CR, Remuneration and Nominations Committees have reviewed actions 
to support and drive forward an inclusive culture through their work during 
the year
• The location of one Board meeting and the timing of the Board strategy day 
have been changed, as recommended
Board mechanics
• Ways to further improve the support for incoming 
presenters to be considered and implemented
• A working party to be established to identify ways  
to enhance site visits 
• Incoming presenters are offered a one-to-one session with committee 
chairmen, the Chairman of the Board, or the Company Secretary before  
their first attendance at a meeting
• A Board group has been established to support interaction at site visits
Tate & Lyle PLC | Annual Report 2015 | 4 9  
 STRATEGIC REPORT FINANCIAL STATEMENTS GOVERNANCE USEFUL INFORMATION learnt from the experiences of the past year. 
These actions are now being implemented 
and include the following:
• Improving the robustness of our investor 
communications and processes
• Improving the way information is 
presented to the Board to allow more time 
for discussion of key issues during Board 
and Committee meetings
• Ensuring issues are fully surfaced in Board 
presentations through pre- and post- 
Board meeting reviews
• Applying additional disciplines to 
operational or strategic proposals that are 
submitted to the Board for consideration
• Driving forward succession planning  
and talent development at senior 
management levels.
Progress will be monitored by the Chairman, 
the Senior Independent Director and the 
Company Secretary throughout the 2016 
financial year and regular updates will be 
provided to the Board. 
Whilst the discussion focused on areas  
for improvement, the Board acknowledged 
that the feedback from the participants 
recognised that the Board operates 
effectively and works well as a team in  
many areas. Numerous positive attributes 
were also identified, including the recent 
changes to the Board, and the actions  
taken during the year to refresh the senior 
management team. 
How are we 
leveraging our 
diverse thinking 
styles?
A key recommendation from the 2014 
Board effectiveness review was that,  
in addition to the annual effectiveness 
review, an externally-facilitated session 
should be carried out focusing on 
boardroom dynamics, relationships  
and how to make better use of the 
Board’s diversity. 
Accordingly, in February 2015, each 
director completed a number of 
questionnaires on their psychological 
preferences, how they make decisions 
and their personal thinking styles. Their 
responses were analysed by a business 
psychologist, Voula Grand, who 
presented her findings to the Board in 
March 2015. This formed the basis of an 
engaged Board discussion, facilitated by 
Voula, during which the Board reviewed 
collective and individual experiences and 
agreed how the findings could be used  
to enhance the Board’s effectiveness. 
A number of actions were agreed, 
including: a review of how the Board 
allocates its time when it is together for 
meetings; obtaining feedback from 
meeting attendees; and building 
relationships outside the boardroom. This 
was considered to be a valuable exercise 
and Voula will be invited back during the 
2016 financial year to review progress.
2015 Board effectiveness review
Review of the Board
The process involved the preparation of a 
short questionnaire by Liz Airey, the Senior 
Independent Director, working with Lucie 
Gilbert, the Company Secretary. This was 
then circulated to all directors, the Executive 
VP General Counsel and the Company 
Secretary. The results were then analysed 
and a report produced. 
The Board’s discussions primarily focused 
on: the Group’s recent under-performance; 
specific challenges faced within the business 
environment over the year; and how 
effectively the Board had handled these.  
It also discussed feedback from investors 
and other stakeholders on how the Board 
had responded to, and communicated,  
the consequential under-performance. A 
number of individual and collective actions 
were developed to address the lessons 
Review of the committees
The effectiveness of the Board’s committees 
was also reviewed, with each of the 
individual committee chairmen facilitating 
their own committee’s review. It was 
confirmed that all committees continue  
to provide effective support to the Board. 
Areas for further focus are noted in the 
individual committee reports.
Review of individual directors
The review of the Chairman was carried out 
by Liz Airey, who sought the individual views 
of each of the executive and non-executive 
directors, led a meeting of the non-executive 
directors to discuss the feedback and then 
provided feedback to the Chairman. 
The Chairman led performance reviews  
of the non-executive directors and the 
performance of the Chief Executive and 
Chief Financial Officer was considered by 
the Nominations Committee, in line with its 
terms of reference. These reviews confirmed 
that each director continues to make an 
effective contribution to the Board’s work 
and is well-prepared and informed about 
issues they needed to consider. In every 
case, their commitment remains strong.
2015 Board effectiveness review
In this review, we were 
determined to address the 
hard lessons we had learnt 
during this very difficult year 
 
When the Board asked me to lead this 
year’s effectiveness review, we all agreed 
that it was imperative that a clear, frank  
and honest assessment of the Board’s 
performance during the past year should  
be conducted. It was also agreed that the 
review should specifically assess whether 
the lessons from the events of this year  
had been fully taken on board. 
My boardroom colleagues provided an 
invaluable array of thoughtful and 
constructive comments and these, together 
with comments from other stakeholders, 
formed the basis of my discussion paper for 
the Board. The Board fully engaged with the 
issues raised in a healthy debate (which  
I led) at our March 2015 Board meeting. 
Whilst we agreed that the Board is generally 
effective, our discussion focused on what 
we had learnt from the events of the last 
year and what we needed to do to improve 
our performance as a Board going forward. 
This includes: how we address and follow 
up key concerns which surface during 
discussions in the boardroom; how 
proposals are presented to us; and how we 
communicate both externally and internally.
We will be taking a number of steps to 
address the personal and collective actions 
that we agreed this year and I will be 
working with the Chairman, the Chief 
Executive and the Company Secretary to 
ensure that these actions are appropriately 
implemented. Our progress will be reported 
in next year’s Annual Report.

GOVERNANCE
Corporate Governance continued Re-election of directors
The Company’s Articles of Association 
require all directors to seek re-election  
by shareholders at least once every three 
years. In addition, any directors appointed 
by the Board must stand for re-election  
at the first AGM following his or her 
appointment. Any non-executive directors 
who have served for more than nine years 
are subject to annual re-election. 
The Code provides that all directors should 
seek re-election on an annual basis and  
all directors will seek re-election at the 
forthcoming AGM. The directors standing 
for re-election, with the exception of Javed 
Ahmed and Nick Hampton, do not have 
service contracts.
At no time during the year has any director 
had any material interest in a contract with 
the Group, being a contract of significance in 
relation to the Group’s business. A statement 
of directors’ interests in Company shares is 
set out on page 78. 
Directors’ conflicts of interest
As permitted under the Companies Act 
2006, the Company’s Articles of Association 
allow directors to authorise conflicts of 
interest and the Board has a policy and 
procedures for managing and, where 
appropriate, authorising, actual or potential 
conflicts of interest. Under those 
procedures, directors are required to 
declare all directorships or other 
appointments to organisations that are not 
part of the Group and which could result  
in actual or potential conflicts of interest,  
as well as other situations which could result 
in a potential conflict of interest. The Board  
is required to review directors’ actual or 
potential conflicts of interest at least 
annually. Directors are required to disclose 
proposed new appointments to the 
Chairman before taking them on, to ensure 
that any potential conflicts of interest can  
be identified and addressed appropriately. 
Any potential conflicts of interest in relation 
to proposed directors are considered by  
the Board prior to their appointment.
Directors’ indemnities and  
insurance cover
As at the date of this Annual Report, 
indemnities are in force under which the 
Company has agreed to indemnify the 
directors, to the extent permitted by the 
Companies Act 2006, against claims from 
third parties in respect of certain liabilities 
arising out of, or in connection with, the 
execution of their powers, duties and 
responsibilities as directors of the Company 
or any of its subsidiaries. The directors are 
also indemnified against the cost of 
defending a criminal prosecution or a claim 
by the Company, its subsidiaries or a 
regulator provided that where the defence is 
unsuccessful the director must repay those 
defence costs. These indemnities are 
qualifying indemnity provisions for the 
purposes of Sections 232 to 234 of the 
Companies Act 2006 and copies are 
available for inspection at the registered 
office of the Company during business 
hours on any weekday except UK public 
holidays. Equivalent indemnities remain in 
force for Tim Lodge and Robert Walker who 
ceased to be directors on 31 August 2014 
and 31 December 2014 respectively.
The Company also maintains directors’ and 
officers’ liability insurance cover, the level of 
which is reviewed annually.
Accountability
Internal control
The Board has overall responsibility for  
the Group’s system of internal control and 
risk management and for reviewing its 
effectiveness. The objective of internal 
control within Tate & Lyle is to support 
efficient implementation of the Group’s 
strategy and effective operations whilst 
enabling it to respond appropriately to 
significant business, operational, financial, 
compliance and other risks to achieving  
the Company’s objectives. The system of 
internal controls is designed to safeguard 
the assets of the Group and to ensure the 
reliability of financial information for both 
internal use and external publication and  
to comply with guidance published by the 
Financial Reporting Council, ‘Internal 
Control: Revised Guidance for Directors’ 
(formerly the Turnbull Guidance). The Board 
recognises that internal control systems are 
designed to identify and manage, rather 
than eliminate, the risk of failure to achieve 
business objectives, and can only provide 
reasonable and not absolute assurance 
against material mis-statement or losses 
and the breach of laws and regulations.
Internal control system
The Board determines the level of risk that  
it is prepared to accept in the business (risk 
appetite) and oversees the strategies for 
significant risks that have been identified. 
Executive management works within the  
risk appetite and develops the mechanisms 
and processes to direct the organisation, 
through setting the tone and expectations 
from the top, delegating authority and 
monitoring compliance. Line management 
has primary responsibility for compliance 
with Group policies, principles and 
compliance requirements. In certain 
functions, notably safety and product 
quality, executive management has also 
established separate assurance teams to 
oversee the effective execution of controls. 
The risk management function works with 
executive management and the divisions to 
help identify, measure, monitor and report 
significant risks. The units report regularly  
on progress with the implementation of the 
Group’s strategy, including its impact on  
the risk environment. Key risks are reviewed 
regularly by the Board. Further information 
on the Group’s risk management process 
can be found on page 34.
The internal audit function provides 
independent and objective assessment of 
the appropriateness and effectiveness of the 
Group’s internal control systems to the Audit 
and CR Committees, and to the Board. It 
has the authority to review any relevant 
aspect of the business and a duty to report 
on any material weaknesses. The Group  
has a risk-based internal audit plan which is 
approved by the Audit and CR Committees. 
It is updated regularly to reflect changes to 
the control environment.
The findings from audits are discussed with 
executive management and action plans  
put in place where appropriate. Progress 
against these plans is monitored regularly  
by the internal audit function. Summaries  
of both audits and progress on any actions 
are discussed regularly at meetings of the 
Audit and CR Committees.
The Board also commissions external 
specialists to supplement internal processes 
as appropriate. Given the significant 
business transformation activity undertaken 
during the year, in addition to regular reports 
from the internal audit function, the Board 
received reports from external specialists 
retained to review key elements of the 
transformation programme.
Key features of the internal  
control system
The Group’s internal control system has a 
number of key features which ensure that 
risk is monitored and managed throughout 
the year, including those listed below.
• The schedule of matters reserved to the 
Board which ensures that the directors 
control, among other matters, all 
significant strategic, financial and 
organisational issues.
• A clear organisational structure and limits 
of authority in respect of items such as 
capital expenditure, pricing and contract 
authorisation.
• A comprehensive planning and budgeting 
system for all items of expenditure with  
an annual budget approved by the Board. 
Performance is reported monthly against 
budget and prior year results; significant 
variances are investigated; and revised 
forecasts for the current financial year and 
financial projections for future years are 
prepared regularly.
• The Group has comprehensive safety, 
product quality assurance and 
environmental management systems. 
Where appropriate, these are 
independently certified to internationally 
recognised standards; they are also subject 
to a regular independent audit process.
Tate & Lyle PLC | Annual Report 2015 | 51  
 STRATEGIC REPORT FINANCIAL STATEMENTS GOVERNANCE USEFUL INFORMATION • The Audit and CR Committees oversee 
the operation of controls and report 
regularly to the Board. If a failure of control 
has a material impact, then a detailed 
investigation, analysis and action plan 
would be provided to and considered by 
the Audit Committee, the CR Committee 
and the Board (as appropriate).
Speak Up (whistleblowing)
Speak Up, the Group’s whistleblowing 
programme, has been in place for a number 
of years in all operations controlled by the 
Group. This programme, which is monitored 
by the Audit and CR Committees, is 
designed to enable employees, contractors, 
customers, suppliers and other stakeholders 
to raise concerns confidentially in cases 
where conduct is deemed to be contrary  
to the Group’s Values. It may include, for 
example, actions that may endanger safety; 
unethical practices; or criminal offences.
The Speak Up programme provides a 
number of alternative ways to raise concerns 
including a telephone reporting line, email, 
and a web-based reporting facility. The 
multilingual communication facilities are 
operated by independent service providers 
who submit a report to the Speak Up 
Committee for investigation. 
Reports received during the year were  
kept strictly confidential and the concerns 
identified were referred to appropriate 
managers within the Group for resolution. 
Where appropriate, action was taken to 
address the issues raised. The reports were 
analysed and monitored to ensure the 
process continued to be effective. There 
were no cases of fraud that were significant 
or that demonstrated material weaknesses 
in internal controls. 
Controls over financial reporting
The financial reporting control system 
covers the financial reporting process  
and the Group’s process for preparing 
consolidated accounts, and includes 
policies and procedures which provide for: 
• The maintenance of records that, in 
reasonable detail, accurately and fairly 
reflect transactions including the 
acquisition and disposal of assets 
• Reasonable assurance that transactions 
are recorded as necessary to permit 
preparation of financial statements in 
accordance with International Financial 
Reporting Standards 
• Reasonable assurance regarding the 
prevention or timely detection of 
unauthorised use of the Group’s assets. 
In addition, specific disclosure controls  
and procedures are in place to support the 
approval of the Group’s financial statements. 
Twice a year, representatives from SFI and 
BI certify that their reported information 
provides a true and fair view of the state  
of the financial affairs of their division and  
its results for the period. The results of this 
financial disclosure process are reported  
to the Audit Committee.
Joint ventures
All material joint ventures, as set out in Note 
16, follow either the Group’s formal systems 
of internal control, or their own internal 
control procedures. These separate 
procedures are subject to review by the 
Group’s internal audit function, and the 
Group works with its partners to ensure  
that action plans are in place to address  
any issues identified during those reviews.
2015 review of the effectiveness of the 
system of internal control
The effectiveness of the Group’s internal 
control system is monitored throughout the 
year. Once a year the Board, with the 
assistance of the Audit and CR Committees, 
conducts its own review of the effectiveness 
of the systems of risk management and 
internal control. In 2015, this review was 
once again facilitated by the internal audit 
function and covered the period from the 
start of the financial year to the date of this 
Annual Report. The process included a 
two-stage review to facilitate discussion, 
with the Audit and CR Committees 
discussing the results of the review at their 
meetings in March and May 2015. The 
Board then discussed the output at its 
meeting in May 2015. 
The 2015 review covered financial, 
operational and compliance controls, Values 
and behaviours, and the risk management 
process, and included questionnaires and 
representation letters completed by 
management. The internal audit function 
monitored and selectively checked the 
results of the review, ensuring that the 
responses from management were 
consistent with the results of its work during 
the year. As part of this process, areas for 
enhancements to internal controls, and 
associated action plans to deliver them, were 
identified. Delivery of these enhancements  
is being monitored by the Audit Committee 
or CR Committee as appropriate. 
As set out in the Chief Executive’s Review, 
supply chain disruption significantly affected 
our business in the financial year, leading to 
both additional costs of order fulfilment and 
missed sales opportunities. The Board 
asked Nick Hampton to lead a full diagnostic 
review of global demand, supply and 
planning processes, details of which are  
on page 9. The review confirmed that 
improvements were needed to operating 
and supply chain planning capabilities and 
to the robustness of internal planning 
processes and a programme to implement 
these improvements is progressing well,  
with a number of actions already in place.
The Board considers that no other areas 
identified for enhancement constituted a 
significant weakness.
Remuneration
The Board has delegated to the 
Remuneration Committee responsibility  
for agreeing the remuneration policy for the 
Chairman, Chief Executive, Chief Financial 
Officer and senior executives. The Chairman 
was a member of the Remuneration 
Committee during the year but was not 
involved in any aspect of his own 
remuneration. The Directors’ Remuneration 
Report on pages 58 to 78 sets out the 
remuneration policy and the way in which  
it has been implemented.
Relations with shareholders
Shareholder communications
The Chief Executive, Chief Financial Officer 
and Group VP , Investor and Media Relations 
maintain a regular programme of visits and 
presentations to institutional shareholders 
both in the UK and overseas. The Chairman 
also undertook separate visits to institutional 
shareholders and Liz Airey also met with  
a number of institutional shareholders 
following her appointment as Senior 
Independent Director. Feedback on 
interaction with institutional shareholders  
is provided to all directors. The Investor 
Relations team provides the Board with  
a report on any meetings with major 
institutional shareholders at each scheduled 
Board meeting. All directors receive copies 
of analysts’ reports on the Company. In 
addition, the Company’s external advisors 
give an annual briefing on investors’ 
perceptions of Tate & Lyle and its investor 
relations activities. The non-executive 
directors are encouraged to attend the 
full-year and half-year results presentations. 
The Company aims to present a balanced 
and clear assessment in all its 
communications with shareholders. Key 
announcements, financial reports and  
other information about the Group can  
be found on the Company’s website,  
www.tateandlyle.com.
Annual General Meeting
The 2015 AGM will be held at The QEII 
Centre in London on Wednesday 29 July 
2015 at 11.00 am. Full details are set out in 
the Notice of Meeting. Shareholders have 
the opportunity to put questions to the 
Board at the AGM on matters relating to  
the Group’s operations and performance. 
Resolutions are decided by means of a poll 
and the votes received in respect of each 
Resolution, together with the level of 
abstentions, are notified to the London 
Stock Exchange and published on the 
Company’s website. Shareholders are 
offered the choice of receiving shareholder 
documentation, including the Annual 
Report, electronically or in paper format,  
as well as the choice of submitting proxy 
votes either electronically or by post.

Corporate Governance continued Audit Committee 
Report
Dear shareholder
I am pleased to present the activities of  
the Audit Committee during the year. 
On 1 January 2015, we welcomed Paul 
Forman to the Board and this Committee; 
and I succeeded Liz Airey as Committee 
Chairman on 1 March 2015. I would like  
to thank Liz for her diligent leadership.
During the year, in addition to our usual 
matters, including the financial results for  
the full year and half year and the interim 
management statements, applicable 
accounting policies and going concern 
assumptions, we continued to undertake 
in-depth reviews of key topics. These 
included a review of the functional and 
presentational currencies used by the 
Group, the finance controls used in 
Speciality Food Ingredients and 
commodities risk management.
Earlier in the Annual Report, we set out the 
issues relating to the supply chain disruption 
that significantly affected our business 
during the financial year under review. While 
this would ordinarily be an area of focus for 
both the Committee and the CR Committee, 
the directors agreed that the issue would be 
addressed and monitored by the Board. 
Further information is set out on page 52.
I led a review of the Committee’s 
effectiveness which concluded that the 
Committee continued to operate effectively 
and identified a number of topics for 
additional focus this year. 
I look forward to meeting with shareholders 
at the forthcoming AGM on 29 July 2015.
Douglas Hurt
Chairman of the Audit Committee
Composition and constitution 
The Audit Committee, which comprises  
four non-executive directors, oversees the 
Group’s financial reporting and internal 
controls and provides a formal reporting link 
with the external auditors. The Committee’s 
terms of reference, which are reviewed 
annually, are available on the Company’s 
website, www.tateandlyle.com.
Main responsibilities of the Audit 
Committee
These include:
• Overseeing the Group’s financial reporting 
process and monitoring the integrity of  
the financial statements and formal 
announcements relating to the Group’s 
financial performance
• Reviewing significant financial reporting 
issues and accounting policies and 
disclosures in financial reports
• Reviewing the effectiveness of the Group’s 
internal control procedures and risk 
management systems
• Reviewing the effectiveness of the internal 
audit function
• Overseeing the Group’s relationship with 
the external auditors including the level  
of fees
• Reviewing and monitoring the external 
auditors’ independence and objectivity 
and the effectiveness of the audit process
• Making recommendations to the Board  
on the appointment or reappointment of 
the Group’s external auditors.
Meetings during the year
The Committee met six times during the 
year and the minutes of each meeting are 
made available to all directors via the Board 
portal. Membership of the Committee and 
attendance during the year were as follows:

1 Succeeded Liz Airey as Chairman of the Audit 
Committee on 1 March 2015.
2 Appointed as director and a member of the Audit 
Committee with effect from 1 January 2015.
The Committee also met twice since the end 
of the financial year and prior to the signing 
of this Annual Report.
All the Committee members have extensive 
management experience in large international 
organisations. It is a requirement of the Code 
that at least one Committee member has 
recent and relevant financial experience.  
Two members meet this requirement: 
Douglas Hurt was Finance Director at IMI plc 
until 28 February 2015 and is a member of 
the Institute of Chartered Accountants in 
England and Wales and Liz Airey was an 
investment banker and former finance 
director of Monument Oil and Gas plc.
The Chief Financial Officer; VP , Group Audit 
and Assurance; Group VP , Finance and 
Control; Executive VP , General Counsel;  
and representatives of the external auditors 
are normally invited to attend each meeting.  
The Chairman of the Board and Chief 
Executive attend meetings of the Committee 
by invitation. In addition, the Committee 
continues to enhance its exposure to the 
business through its programme of key 
topics for in-depth review, which involves 
operational and other key senior managers 
presenting to the Committee.
The VP , Group Audit and Assurance and  
the external auditors have direct access to, 
and meet regularly with, the Chairman of  
the Committee outside formal Committee 
meetings.
Independence of the external auditors 
The Group’s external auditors are 
PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP (PwC) and  
the Committee operates a policy to safeguard 
their objectivity and independence.  
This policy sets out certain disclosure 
requirements by the external auditors to the 
Committee; restrictions on the employment 
of the external auditors’ former employees; 
and partner rotation. During the year, the 
Committee reviewed the processes that the 
external auditors have in place to safeguard 
their independence, and received a letter 
from the external auditors confirming that,  
in their opinion, they remained independent.
The policy also sets out the circumstances  
in which the external auditors may be 
permitted to undertake non-audit services. 
The Chief Financial Officer and Chairman of 
the Committee have authority to approve the 
provision of certain services up to £100,000 
or £250,000 respectively. The Committee 
must approve any proposed non-audit 
services that exceed those thresholds.  
Such proposals must be justified and, if 
appropriate, be subject to tender. In addition, 
the policy specifies the services which are 
not permitted under any circumstances, 
such as the provision of remuneration advice 
and internal audit outsourcing.
The Committee reviews the policy on an 
annual basis and considers quarterly reports 
which set out the ongoing non-audit 
services provided by the auditors and the 
fees incurred. 
In June 2014, restrictions around the 
provision of non-audit services by the 
auditors and a 70% non-audit services fee 
cap came into effect at EU level. These 
proposals are likely to come into force at  
UK level during 2016 and the Committee  
will revise the policy to reflect the new 
requirements as they take effect.
Tate & Lyle PLC | Annual Report 2015 | 5 3  
STRATEGIC REPORT FINANCIAL STATEMENTS GOVERNANCE USEFUL INFORMATION A breakdown of the fees paid to the external 
auditors in respect of audit- and non-audit-
related work is included in Note 7 . The total 
amount paid in respect of the Group audit, 
audit of subsidiaries and the half-year review 
was £2.0 million, and £0.2 million was paid in 
respect of non-audit-related services. Fees 
paid in respect of non-audit-related services 
therefore comprised 10% of the total fees 
paid to PwC.
Work undertaken during the year
The Committee maintains a calendar of 
items for consideration at each meeting.  
In addition to the activities outlined in the 
statement from the Committee Chairman, 
during the year and up to the date of this 
Annual Report, the work undertaken by  
the Committee fell under four main areas: 
financial reporting; oversight of the external 
auditors; oversight of the internal audit 
function; and internal control and risk 
management. 
Financial reporting
At each of its meetings, the Audit Committee 
reviewed accounting papers prepared by 
management and determined, with the 
perspective of the external auditors, the 
appropriateness of key accounting policies, 
estimates and judgements. The significant 
issues considered by the Committee in 
relation to the financial statements for the 
year ended 31 March 2015 are listed below.
Sucralose assets
As explained in the Chief Executive’s Review, 
the Group undertook a detailed analysis of 
our SPLENDA
®
 Sucralose business to 
evaluate how to maximise returns in a 
competitive market. The Board agreed to 
re-focus the SPLENDA
®
 Sucralose business 
in two ways: by taking a rigorous valued 
based approach to securing volume, and  
by materially lowering the manufacturing 
cost base of the business by consolidating 
all production into the McIntosh, Alabama 
facility and closing the facility in Singapore. 
The Committee reviewed the carrying value 
of the Group’s SPLENDA
®
 Sucralose assets 
and determined that the full carrying value  
of the Singapore facility should be written off 
in advance of the closure of the facility. The 
Committee further determined, that based 
on the analysis of the business and future 
cost base, no impairment was required in 
respect of the McIntosh assets.
Commodity risk
The Group uses corn commodity contracts 
to manage and hedge its corn positions in 
the US. The valuation of the corn book, which 
is underpinned by a number of judgements, 
has a material impact on the reported results 
of the Group. The Committee received 
regular updates on the key commodity risks 
and the risk management framework in place 
to mitigate these risks. In addition, the 
Committee considered the work performed 
by the external auditors before concluding 
that the judgments made in determining the 
valuation were appropriate. This will continue 
to be a key area of focus for the Committee 
going forward.
Implementation of Common IS/IT system
As set out in the Chief Executive’s Review, 
the Group deployed its global IS/IT platform 
in the North American business and in 
Singapore during the year, following 
deployment in Europe in 2012. The 
Committee closely monitored plans to 
mitigate the risk of breakdown in internal 
financial controls during the transition and 
the increased risk of inaccurate or 
incomplete migration of financial data. 
Following implementation, the Committee 
continues to monitor the controls in place  
as part of its ongoing oversight role. 
Taxation 
The Group operates in a number of tax 
jurisdictions and provision for potential direct 
tax exposures with local tax authorities is 
underpinned by a range of judgements.  
The Committee reviewed the Group’s 
principles and processes for managing tax 
risks during the year and reviewed the key 
judgements made in estimating the Group’s 
tax charge along with the key disclosures, 
including a statement of tax principles, 
included in the Annual Report (set out on 
page 29 and in Notes 10 and 28). The 
Committee was satisfied that the judgements 
made in estimating the Group’s tax charge 
were reasonable, and that the disclosures  
in the Annual Report were appropriate.
Retirement obligations
The Group has significant retirement benefit 
obligations in the UK and the US, including 
unfunded retirement medical plans in the  
US and a number of judgements have to  
be made when calculating the fair value of 
the Group’s legacy retirement obligations.  
The Committee reviewed the assumptions 
proposed by management (reflecting advice 
from the Group’s external actuary) which 
have driven an increase in the pension  
and healthcare net liability (see Note 29)  
and considered reports from the external 
auditors before agreeing that the 
assumptions were reasonable. 
Reported and adjusted earnings 
The Committee considered management’s 
review of reported and adjusted earnings, 
and satisfied itself that significant one-off 
items of income and expense had been 
correctly classified and that external 
disclosure of these items was appropriate.
The Committee also reviewed 
management’s annual goodwill impairment 
assessment paper, considering future 
performance of the underlying divisions, 
including discussion of the discount rates 
used and forecast assumptions and 
sensitivities. The Committee was satisfied 
that, other than in respect of the SPLENDA
®
 
Sucralose plant in Singapore, no impairment 
charges, or reversal of impairments, were 
required. Papers on the Group’s existing and 
emerging litigation risks were considered. 
External auditors
PwC (or its predecessor firms) have been 
the Company’s auditors since 1989. The 
lead audit partner is rotated on a five-yearly 
basis. The current lead audit partner, John 
Waters, has been in place since the audit for 
the year ended 31 March 2014. Accordingly, 
he is due to rotate off at the conclusion of 
the audit for the year ending 31 March 2018.
Following the conclusion of the audit for the 
year ended 31 March 2014, the Committee 
conducted an internal review of the 
effectiveness of the auditors (the last 
external review being in 2010). As part of  
the process, the Committee reviewed the 
auditors’ performance against criteria set at 
the start of the audit, together with feedback 
from management at Group level and at 
divisional level and considered the most 
recent public report on the inspection of 
PwC which was issued by the FRC in May 
2014. The Committee concluded that the 
external audit process was operating 
effectively and that PwC continued to 
provide effective and independent challenge 
to management. The review identified a 
number of areas for process enhancements 
which were implemented and incorporated 
into the criteria set for the audit in respect  
of the year ended 31 March 2015.
The Code states that FTSE 350 companies 
should tender the provision of audit services 
at least every ten years or explain their 
approach, if different. The Competition & 
Markets Authority has published additional 
proposals which came into effect in January 
2015. These require FTSE 350 companies  
to put their statutory audit engagement out 
to tender at least every ten years. In addition 
to this, the European Parliament’s 
proposals, which include the requirement 
that audit firms of all EU companies listed  
on a regulated market are subject to 
retender after ten years and rotate off after 
20 years, came into force at EU level in June 
2014. The Committee continues to keep 
under review the legal and regulatory 
developments in this regard.

Corporate Governance continued Nominations 
Committee Report
Dear shareholder
This year, the Committee continued to focus 
on both Board succession plans and 
executive succession planning and the 
outcomes are set out in this report.
I led the review of the Committee’s 
effectiveness. The review concluded that the 
Committee was functioning effectively and 
recommended some process changes that 
we have already implemented. 
Looking ahead, this year, we plan to focus  
in particular on talent management and 
succession planning for critical roles outside 
the Board and Group Executive Committee 
to ensure that our talent pipeline is 
appropriately resourced and supported.
Sir Peter Gershon
Chairman of the  
Nominations Committee
Composition and constitution
The Nominations Committee comprises  
the Chairman of the Company, the Chief 
Executive and all the non-executive 
directors. It ensures that the balance of  
skills and experience of the Board remains 
appropriate for the needs of the Group.  
The Committee’s terms of reference, which 
are reviewed annually, are available on the 
Company’s website, www.tateandlyle.com.
Main responsibilities of the Committee
These include:
• Reviewing the size and composition of the 
Board, including succession planning, and 
the leadership needs of the Group generally
• Recommending candidates for 
appointment as executive and non-
executive directors and as Company 
Secretary, taking into account the balance 
of the Board and the required blend of 
skills and experience, bearing in mind the 
need for diversity
• Making recommendations on the process 
for the appointment of the Chairman of  
the Board
• Reviewing annually the performance of 
each member of the Group Executive 
Committee and reporting on that review  
to the Remuneration Committee.

the signing of this Annual Report.
Work undertaken during the year
During the year and up to the date of this 
Annual Report, in addition to the work set 
out in the Chairman’s letter above, the work 
undertaken by the Nominations Committee 
included:
Under the transitional provisions attached to 
the EU rules, the Group would be required 
to change auditors for the next audit 
appointment after 17 June 2020. As a result, 
the final year that PwC could be appointed 
would be the year ending 31 March 2020 
and an audit tender to appoint new external 
auditors would need to take place in time for 
the Group’s Annual General Meeting in 2020 
at the latest.
The Committee discussed the timing of a 
tender on a regular basis during the financial 
year ended 31 March 2015. In light of the 
change in Chief Financial Officer and the 
ongoing embedding of the global IS/IT 
system, the Committee agreed to revisit 
timing of the tender during the year ending 
31 March 2016. The Committee has 
recommended to the Board that PwC 
continue to act as auditors to the Group. 
PwC has indicated its willingness to 
continue in office; a resolution that PwC be 
reappointed will be proposed at the AGM. 
Internal audit function
The Committee reviewed the remit, 
organisation, annual plan and resources  
of the internal audit function and concluded 
that the function continued to operate 
effectively. The last external review was 
undertaken in November 2013.
Internal control and risk management
The Committee continued to receive and 
consider regular reports from management 
and the VP , Group Audit and Assurance  
on the effectiveness of the Group’s risk 
management system. The reports from  
the latter included the findings from reviews 
of internal financial controls and actions to 
address any weaknesses in those controls. 
The Committee also reviewed the operation 
of the independent confidential reporting line.
Throughout the year, the Committee 
focused in particular on the impact of the 
implementation of the new IS/IT system  
and associated changes to the control 
environment, together with any potential 
impact on financial reporting processes.  
It also reviewed controls to mitigate fraud 
risk and the Group assurance map outlining 
the key risks and associated assurance 
processes. In addition, the Committee 
reviewed the output from the annual review 
of the effectiveness of internal financial 
reporting controls and then reported to  
the Board on that review.

 STRATEGIC REPORT FINANCIAL STATEMENTS GOVERNANCE USEFUL INFORMATION Corporate 
Responsibility 
Committee Report
Dear shareholder
Last year, I wrote of our deep shock and 
sadness at the tragic fatalities at three of  
our sites. 
As explained on page 6, very sadly, two 
contractors died in an accident that 
occurred in April 2014 and then in June 
2014, one of our colleagues died in a tractor 
accident at one of our grain elevators.  
We are extremely saddened by these losses 
at our sites. These accidents have been 
thoroughly investigated internally and 
externally and we have ensured that the 
families and others affected by the accidents 
have been supported.
Against this tragic backdrop, the Group’s 
safety performance has improved 
significantly since June 2014. We have 
overseen management’s efforts to re-focus 
and refresh our approach to safety which is 
set out on page 38, and I have personally 
visited a number of our sites in the US during 
the year to meet local safety management 
and review safety activities. We continue to 
review safety at each Committee meeting.
On 1 March 2015, we welcomed Douglas 
Hurt to the Committee as he succeeded Liz 
Airey as Chairman of the Audit Committee.  
I would like to thank Liz for her contribution 
to the Committee since its inception and 
look forward to working with Douglas on  
the Committee.
I look forward to meeting shareholders at 
our AGM.
William Camp
Chairman of the CR Committee
Senior Independent Director 
In addition, the Committee recommended 
that Liz Airey, with eight years of Board 
service and having very good experience  
of the UK market and institutional 
shareholders, should be appointed as 
Senior Independent Director with effect  
from 1 January 2015. 
Chairmanship of Committees 
The Committee reviewed the chairmanship 
of the Board committees and recommended 
that Anne Minto, who has significant 
remuneration experience, be appointed 
chairman of the Remuneration Committee 
with effect from 1 January 2015. The 
Committee also recommended that  
Douglas Hurt, with his extensive experience 
as the former Finance Director of IMI plc,  
be appointed as Chairman of the Audit 
Committee with effect from 1 March 2015.
Committee membership 
With regard to the composition of the Board’s 
Committees, the Committee recommended 
that Sir Peter Gershon step down as a 
member of the Remuneration Committee 
with effect from 1 June 2015, in line with 
practice in other large listed companies. 
All recommendations were approved by  
the Board.
Succession planning – Group Executive 
Committee
Another key area of focus this year was  
the refreshment of the Group Executive 
Committee. Members of the Committee 
participated in the interview processes and 
met with the Chief Executive and Executive 
VP , Human Resources to provide feedback. 
The Committee agreed that Gabriella 
Parisse, Joan Braca, Jim Stutelberg,  
Pierre Schoumacher and Rowan Adams  
be appointed to the Group Executive 
Committee during the year and these 
appointments were subsequently approved 
by the Board. 
Talent management
The Committee also reviewed the wider 
succession plans and talent management 
process and the progress made to embed 
HR processes to assist in retaining and 
developing existing employees while 
attracting new talent into the Group.
Performance evaluation
The Committee undertook a performance 
evaluation of each member of the Group 
Executive Committee and reported its 
conclusions to the Remuneration Committee.
Board succession planning
Appointment of Nick Hampton 
Following Tim Lodge’s indication that he was 
ready for a new challenge, the Committee, 
supported by the Executive VP , Human 
Resources, appointed The Zygos 
Partnership to assist them in the search  
for a new Chief Financial Officer. Zygos 
Partnership, which is a signatory to the 
Executive Search Firms Voluntary Code of 
Conduct, has worked on other assignments 
with the Group and proposed a number of 
candidates who were interviewed by the 
Chief Executive and Executive VP , Human 
Resources. The final candidate, Nick 
Hampton, was then interviewed by the 
Chairman and four non-executive directors. 
In line with our standard process for senior 
executive recruitment, an independent 
external assessment of capabilities was 
undertaken by YSC, a specialist business 
psychology company, before the Committee 
recommended that Nick Hampton be 
appointed Chief Financial Officer from  
1 September 2014. The recommendation 
was approved by the Board.
Appointment of Paul Forman
As explained last year, the Committee 
retained Spencer Stuart to assist the 
Committee with the search for an additional 
non-executive director who could serve on 
the Audit and Remuneration Committees. 
Spencer Stuart is a signatory to the 
Executive Search Firms Voluntary Code  
of Conduct and has a good understanding  
of the Group’s business as it has previously 
assisted in the identification of individuals  
to fill other senior executive roles. Spencer 
Stuart prepared a ‘long list’ comprising  
a diverse range of potential candidates 
meeting the specification. The search 
consultants and the Chairman then 
identified a subset of this long list to meet 
face-to-face with the Chairman. Following 
these initial interviews, the Chairman 
recommended a short list of candidates  
to be interviewed by a working party 
comprising the Chief Executive and two 
other members of the Committee.
The Committee subsequently discussed  
the results of these interviews and also 
reviewed the candidates’ anticipated ability  
to provide the necessary time commitment 
to Tate & Lyle. The Committee recommended 
that Paul Forman be appointed as an 
additional non-executive director. This 
recommendation, together with the 
Committee memberships proposed for  
Paul, was approved by the Board and  
he joined the Board on 1 January 2015.

During the year and up to the date of this 
Annual Report, in addition to the work 
outlined in the Committee Chairman’s letter, 
the work undertaken by the CR Committee 
included the following:
Safety
The Committee undertook a series of 
detailed reviews focusing first on proposals 
to re-focus and refresh the approach to

STRATEGIC REPORT FINANCIAL STATEMENTS GOVERNANCE USEFUL INFORMATION Dear shareholder
As Chairman of the Remuneration 
Committee, I am pleased to present our 
Remuneration Report for the financial year 
ended 31 March 2015. This introduction 
provides context for the Committee’s 
decision-making during the year, and 
summarises key points from the Report, 
including those relating to performance and 
incentive plan outcomes, and Committee 
activities during the year. 
I succeeded Robert Walker as Chairman  
of the Committee on 1 January 2015, and  
I would like to thank him for his stewardship.
Business performance context
The year under review has been very 
challenging, with financial performance  
held back by some key factors which are 
discussed in the Chief Executive’s Review 
and Chairman’s Statement, primarily:
• Significant disruption to our supply chain 
resulting from prolonged and severe 
winter conditions in the US which led to 
the Company starting the financial year 
with much lower inventory than usual
• Supply constraints, resulting from an 
extended shutdown of the SPLENDA
®
 
Sucralose facility in Singapore at the start 
of the financial year, coupled with 
extremely competitive market conditions.
Notwithstanding these challenges, the 
fundamentals of the business remain strong 
and the Company continues to make clear 
strategic progress: 
• We completed two bolt-on acquisitions in 
the emerging markets during the year, 
including a joint venture with Gemacom 
Tech, the leading domestically-owned 
Food Systems business in Brazil.
• We continue to see the benefits of the 
investment we have made in our 
innovation capabilities with two major new 
product launches: CLARIA
®
 Functional 
Clean-Label Starches, boosts our 
texturant offering; and in February, we 
launched in the US, DOLCIA PRIMA™ 
Allulose, a low-calorie sugar that provides 
many of the same attributes as table 
sugar, but with 90% fewer calories.  
Remuneration outcomes for the year
As set out in this report, remuneration 
outcomes for the year were as follows: 
• Annual Bonus Plan: No bonus is 
payable to executive directors for the year 
ending 31 March 2015, as profit fell below 
the threshold level that was set by the 
Committee at the start of the year.
• Performance Share Plan: Our 
published adjusted return on capital 
employed in the year to 31 March 2015 
was 13.9%, which exceeds the threshold 
requirement of 13.4% and is in excess of 
our cost of capital. Earnings per share 
(EPS) targets have not been achieved. 
Accordingly, a vesting level just above 
threshold was achieved. Javed Ahmed 
has informed the Committee  
that, having taken into account financial 
performance in the round, he would waive 
his entitlement to the award. 
Key Committee activities during  
the year
In addition to the responsibilities of the 
Committee (which are described in 
summary on page 70), the Committee spent 
significant time on matters relating to the 
following key items during the year:
• Executive director changes: Nick 
Hampton was appointed Chief Financial 
Officer and joined the Group on  
1 September 2014; Tim Lodge stepped 
down as Chief Financial Officer on  
31 August 2014. The Committee 
considered and approved remuneration 
terms in respect of these transitions, 
operating within the remuneration policy 
that shareholders approved at the 
Company’s Annual General Meeting 
(AGM) on 24 July 2014. Further details  
are provided in this Report and key terms 
are summarised on page 71.
• Senior executive appointments: 
During the year, a number of changes  
at Executive Committee level were made 
to strengthen the broader executive team. 
The Committee has carefully considered 
appropriate remuneration terms for each 
of these appointments, taking account  
of individual skills and experience,  
in conjunction with the Nominations 
Committee.
• Review and planning: The remuneration 
framework has essentially been in place  
in its current form since 2010. In January 
2015, the Committee set aside time to 
consider, with input from management 
and our external advisor, whether there 
were opportunities to improve the 
effectiveness of our arrangements. Based 
on this review, the Committee noted that: 
 – The overall framework is considered to 
be fit for purpose, providing for a clear 
alignment between Company 
performance and Directors’ 
remuneration
 – The remuneration policy conforms to a 
number of ‘good practice’ expectations, 
and is supported by shareholders
 – Both the Annual Bonus Plan and 
Performance Share Plan require careful 
calibration of targets against the business 
strategy and outlook, to ensure the 
continued effectiveness of these plans
 – The inclusion of non-financial objectives 
within the Annual Bonus Plan (consistent 
with our remuneration policy) would 
provide an opportunity to align the 
organisation behind some critical 
strategic and operational priorities to 
strengthen the business through the 
year ending 31 March 2016 and beyond. 
Accordingly, I can confirm that no changes 
are proposed to the remuneration policy 
which was approved by shareholders at the 
2014 AGM.
In March 2015, I led the annual review of  
the Committee’s effectiveness. The review 
concluded that the Committee appropriately 
fulfilled its role and carried out its duties 
against the responsibilities described in its 
terms of reference.

GOVERNANCE 
Directors’ Remuneration Report Business re-alignment to focus on and 
strengthen Speciality Food Ingredients
On 21 April 2015, we announced a 
restructuring of our European and SPLENDA
®
 
Sucralose businesses to establish a more 
focused Company through which to 
accelerate the delivery of our strategy.
These actions improve our strategic 
positioning and are expected to improve  
our long-term outlook and ability to maximise 
returns in a competitive market. However,  
the structural and mid-term financial 
considerations will also impact the 
appropriateness of the performance 
conditions attached to future incentive 
awards. We therefore expect to review the 
PSP conditions that will apply for awards 
made in 2015, in keeping with our approved 
remuneration policy, and to consult with 
shareholders, as appropriate, later in the year.
Remuneration Report and 
implementation of policy for the  
year ahead
Our Remuneration Policy was approved  
by shareholders at last year’s AGM with 
97 .87% of votes in favour. 
The Committee is satisfied that this  
policy provides for a strong alignment 
between Company performance and the 
remuneration of executive directors and,  
as stated in this Report, we intend to 
continue to operate within this approved 
remuneration policy during the financial  
year ending 31 March 2016.

Remuneration Committee
About these Reports 
The information regarding directors’ 
remuneration is presented in two Reports: 
the first relates to our remuneration policy 
(the Directors’ Remuneration Policy Report), 
and the second relates to the way in which 
our established policy has been 
implemented during the year under review 
(the Annual Report on Remuneration). 
A resolution to approve the Annual Report 
on Remuneration will be proposed at the 
AGM on 29 July 2015.
The Directors’ Remuneration Policy Report 
was formally approved by shareholders at 
the AGM in 2014 and it remains our intention 
that the policy will apply for a period of three 
years from the date of that AGM.
These Reports have been prepared in 
accordance with the requirements of  
the Companies Act 2006 (the Act) and 
Schedule 8 of the Large and Medium Sized 
Companies and Groups (Accounts and 
Reports) (Amendment) Regulations 2013  
(the Regulations), the Listing Rules of  
the UK Listing Authority and the UK  
Corporate Governance Code. 
PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP has audited 
such content as required by the Act  
(the information on pages 73 to 78 marked  
as ‘(audited)’). 
Directors’ 
Remuneration 
Policy Report
Introduction
This Report sets out the Company’s policy 
in relation to directors’ remuneration, which 
was approved by shareholders at the 2014 
AGM. This approach was originally 
established in 2010 in connection with the 
review of the business strategy following 
Javed Ahmed’s appointment as Chief 
Executive, and the policy and remuneration 
framework we have today is fundamentally 
unchanged from that set out in the Annual 
Reports since 2011. 
Specifically, no changes have been made  
to the Remuneration Policy which was 
approved by our shareholders at the 2014 
AGM (and which is included in this Report).
We intend to operate within this policy 
during the financial year ending  
31 March 2016.
The Committee retains discretion on specific 
aspects of policy and implementation, as 
described in this Report, along with an 
overriding discretion to determine bonus 
outcomes and judge the level at which  
share awards vest, in order to ensure that 
payments are consistent with the underlying 
health and performance of the business, 
within the maximum opportunity stated in 
the policy tables.
The Committee may make minor changes 
to the policy without seeking shareholder 
approval, for example, to benefit the 
administration of arrangements, or to take 
account of changes in legislation. Any such 
changes would be disclosed in the relevant 
Annual Report.

 STRATEGIC REPORT FINANCIAL STATEMENTS GOVERNANCE USEFUL INFORMATION Remuneration strategy and key principles
The Company’s remuneration strategy, and supporting principles which apply consistently across employee, management and executive 
populations, is summarised in the table below.
Remuneration strategy Key principles
The Company’s 
remuneration strategy  
is to provide packages  
that enable the Company 
to recruit, retain and 
motivate high-calibre 
individuals in the  
markets in which  
we operate to deliver 
superior operational 
performance and 
outstanding  
financial results 
• Base pay and benefits are generally positioned at local market ‘median’ levels
• For all employees, our pay for performance framework provides for meaningful differentiation in salary 
progression and opportunities for career progression, based on each individual’s contribution
• The total package opportunity should provide meaningful reward for superior performance and encourage 
the achievement of genuinely stretching short-term and long-term objectives
• Below executive level, key individuals who have a specific accountability for driving annual and longer-term 
performance may be selected to participate variously in our sales incentive plan, the Annual Bonus Plan, 
and/or the Performance Share Plan
• Alignment with shareholders’ long-term interests is carefully preserved, for example, through: a significant  
proportion of pay being based on performance; effective governance around remuneration decisions;  
a considered approach to setting performance targets; the adoption of shareholding guidelines at senior  
executive levels; and malus and claw back provisions on incentive awards
• All aspects of remuneration are designed to encourage a focus on long-term, sustained performance  
and risk management
• Our approach is intended to be equitable and transparent and operate across the Group, recognising  
that we recruit talented individuals and operate in an international market
• Outcomes must be achieved in a way that is consistent with the Group’s core Values and Code of Ethics,  
and that fosters sustainable, profitable growth
The charts below illustrate the international nature of our business – although we are UK-listed and headquartered in London, a very 
significant proportion of our people, our shareholders, and our customers are based outside the UK. Accordingly, it is important that  
our remuneration arrangements are appropriately competitive in that international context.

GOVERNANCE
Directors’ Remuneration Report continued A clear link between our strategy and directors’ remuneration
The Company’s remuneration arrangements place a clear emphasis on driving Company performance, through incentives that are directly 
linked to the key performance indicators (KPIs) which come from our business strategy. In this way, we maintain a keen focus on delivering 
long-term growth, thereby enhancing long-term value for shareholders.
The table below summarises the KPIs that we use to measure the Group’s success against our strategy. The right-hand column describes 
how these KPIs link directly to remuneration arrangements.
p22
Key Performance Indicators
Key performance indicators Link to directors’ remuneration
Financial results 
Adjusted operating profit This is a key determinant of awards under the Annual Bonus Plan
Adjusted diluted EPS growth Awards under the Performance Share Plan depend on this metric
Dividend per share The dividend has a direct impact through individual executive share ownership  
and dividend equivalents on deferred bonus awards
Net debt Objectives are reflected in incentive plan target setting, but this metric does not 
directly impact remuneration
Performance and financial strength (in addition to the above)
Speciality Food Ingredients sales growth Informs the sales target in the Annual Bonus Plan that is set by the Committee  
each year
Return on capital employed Awards under the Performance Share Plan depend on this metric
Cash conversion cycle This is a performance metric in the Annual Bonus Plan
Net debt to EBITDA and interest cover Objectives are reflected in Annual Bonus Plan targets, but this metric does not 
directly impact remuneration
Corporate responsibility
Safety metrics Safety and broader corporate responsibility matters are specific factors that the 
Committee may factor into decisions on pay and annual incentive plan outcomes 
Key components of directors’ remuneration
As a Committee, we believe that our approach to remuneration provides a relatively simple but effective overall framework that is aligned  
with long-term success and returns to shareholders.
The executive directors’ remuneration consists of base salary, annual bonus, long-term incentives, and retirement and other benefits as 
described in the table overleaf. Malus and claw back provisions apply to incentive awards following release (as described in the policy table 
on pages 62 to 65), and a strong alignment with shareholders’ interests is maintained through significant personal shareholding 
requirements imposed on each director.
The key components of the remuneration framework for executive directors are summarised in the table below, and the full policy in relation 
to each item is described in the tables that follow.
Key components of directors’ remuneration
Fixed Variable (short-term) Variable (long-term)
Base salary: providing fixed remuneration 
which reflects the market value of the role
Annual bonus: to deliver the Company’s 
annual financial performance objectives
Long-term share incentive: to deliver 
shareholder value linked to efficient use of 
capital and profitable long-term growth
Employment/retirement benefits: 
consistent with local market practice
Malus and claw back provisions mean cash and share incentives may be recouped  
in specific circumstances
Personal share ownership: strengthens alignment between executives  
and shareholders

 STRATEGIC REPORT FINANCIAL STATEMENTS GOVERNANCE USEFUL INFORMATION Executive directors’ remuneration policy table
Purpose and alignment with strategy Operation Opportunity Performance framework Commentary
Base salary (short-term, fixed remuneration)
To provide fixed remuneration that reflects 
the market value of the individual, his or her 
skills and experience and performance
• Base salaries are positioned at around the 
median of the relevant market based on 
company size and operations (for UK 
directors, the Committee currently has 
regard to the 50th to 130th largest 
UK-listed companies), and taking account 
of personal performance, as well as 
individual circumstances (for example 
following promotion into a new role)
• Base salary reviews take into account 
increases awarded to employees 
below executive level, and the impact 
on pension and other consequences  
of increases
• Increases arising from the normal 
annual review will normally be limited  
to the local market increase applicable 
to employees at the same location 
generally. However, the Committee 
may use its discretion to award a higher 
or lower increase to ensure that salaries 
remain appropriately aligned with the 
external market, and to reflect changes 
in experience, role or responsibility
• Base salary is a fixed element of the remuneration package, paid monthly
• Employees generally participate in a merit-based review, which means that the  
general market increase which applies will be sufficient to maintain competitiveness 
against the local market, while individual high performers may be rewarded with higher 
salary increases
• A consistent framework applies to 
employees generally – salaries are 
positioned by reference to the local  
market median, and salary reviews  
take into account local market  
increases, external benchmarking,  
and personal performance 
• No changes to the policy for executive 
directors have been made in the year  
or are proposed for the year ahead
Employment and retirement benefits (short-term, fixed remuneration)
• To provide employment and retirement 
benefits in line with the relevant local 
market
• Retirement benefits are provided by way  
of defined contribution arrangements,  
or an equivalent cash allowance
• Other employment benefits include car  
(or car allowance), health insurance, group 
income protection and, where appropriate, 
life cover
• The value of retirement and/or cash 
benefits in lieu of pension is set by 
reference to external market practice 
(using the same market reference point 
as for base salary), and is subject to 
periodic review
• The value of non-cash benefits is 
determined by the cost of provision,  
for example, third-party health 
insurance premiums
• Benefits are a fixed part of the remuneration package, and typically accrue monthly
• Retirement benefits are defined contribution in nature, limiting the financial risk and 
potential costs to the Company
• The provision of employment and 
retirement benefits to executive directors 
is consistent with our policy and approach 
for employees generally: appropriate 
benefits are provided in line with local 
competitive market practice 
• No changes to the policy for executive 
directors have been made in the year  
or are proposed for the year ahead
Annual bonus (short-term, performance-related remuneration)
• To support the Company’s strategy by 
rewarding the achievement of the 
Company’s annual performance 
objectives 
• The discretionary Annual Bonus Plan 
rewards the achievement of financial and 
other objectives established by the 
Committee for the relevant financial year
• The bonus award is made, subject to  
the Committee’s approval, following the  
end of the financial year and the audit  
of full-year results 
• The bonus award may comprise cash and 
deferred shares, depending on the level of 
award that is made
• No bonus is payable if performance  
is below ‘threshold’, regardless of 
performance against other metrics
• The ‘target’ bonus is 75% of base 
salary for the Chief Executive, and 50% 
of base salary for the Chief Financial 
Officer
• The maximum cash bonus is 100%  
of base salary; any annual bonus above 
100% of base salary is delivered in  
Tate & Lyle PLC shares which are 
deferred for two years 
• The maximum cash and share bonus  
is 175% of base salary
• Deferred shares carry the right to 
receive a cash payment in lieu of the 
dividend that would have been paid  
on those shares between award  
and release 
• Performance is assessed over the relevant financial year
• Performance metrics are selected by the Committee at the start of the relevant year,  
and are drawn from key financial metrics. Additionally, the Committee may select  
quantifiable metrics that are aligned with our strategic and/or operational objectives  
on a personal or collective basis 
• Targets for each metric are set at the start of each financial year, taking account of  
the business strategy, performance in previous years, market expectations and the 
prevailing economic climate
• The greatest weighting will be given to financial performance; specifically, a minimum 
profit hurdle applies before any bonus is payable against any of the metrics
• The final bonus award is made at the Committee’s discretion. Subject to the overall 
maximum, the Committee may make appropriate adjustments to ensure that the bonus 
outcomes are a fair reflection of the underlying performance of the Company and may 
also take into account factors such as Group safety, operational performance, and 
personal performance
• Malus and claw back provisions apply, 
which means cash and share elements 
may be recouped in specific circumstances 
during the two-year period following the 
end of the financial year to which the  
bonus relates
• The discretionary Annual Bonus Plan 
applies to a broad population who have 
roles which allow them to contribute 
materially to the successful delivery  
of the Company’s annual performance 
objectives. The Annual Bonus Plan 
operates within a consistent framework  
for all participants, with financial targets 
typically set by reference to the business 
area that is most relevant to the 
employee’s role
• No changes to the policy for executive 
directors have been made in the year  
or are proposed for the year ahead

• Retirement benefits are provided by way  
of defined contribution arrangements,  
or an equivalent cash allowance
• Other employment benefits include car  
(or car allowance), health insurance, group 
income protection and, where appropriate, 
life cover
• The value of retirement and/or cash 
benefits in lieu of pension is set by 
reference to external market practice 
(using the same market reference point 
as for base salary), and is subject to 
periodic review
• The value of non-cash benefits is 
determined by the cost of provision,  
for example, third-party health 
insurance premiums
• Benefits are a fixed part of the remuneration package, and typically accrue monthly
• Retirement benefits are defined contribution in nature, limiting the financial risk and 
potential costs to the Company
• The provision of employment and 
retirement benefits to executive directors 
is consistent with our policy and approach 
for employees generally: appropriate 
benefits are provided in line with local 
competitive market practice 
• No changes to the policy for executive 
directors have been made in the year

Annual bonus (short-term, performance-related remuneration)
• To support the Company’s strategy by 
rewarding the achievement of the 
Company’s annual performance 
objectives 
• The discretionary Annual Bonus Plan 
rewards the achievement of financial and 
other objectives established by the 
Committee for the relevant financial year
• The bonus award is made, subject to  
the Committee’s approval, following the  
end of the financial year and the audit  
of full-year results 
• The bonus award may comprise cash and 
deferred shares, depending on the level of 
award that is made
• No bonus is payable if performance  
is below ‘threshold’, regardless of 
performance against other metrics
• The ‘target’ bonus is 75% of base 
salary for the Chief Executive, and 50% 
of base salary for the Chief Financial 
Officer
• The maximum cash bonus is 100%  
of base salary; any annual bonus above 
100% of base salary is delivered in  
Tate & Lyle PLC shares which are 
deferred for two years 
• The maximum cash and share bonus  
is 175% of base salary
• Deferred shares carry the right to 
receive a cash payment in lieu of the 
dividend that would have been paid  
on those shares between award  
and release 
• Performance is assessed over the relevant financial year
• Performance metrics are selected by the Committee at the start of the relevant year,  
and are drawn from key financial metrics. Additionally, the Committee may select  
quantifiable metrics that are aligned with our strategic and/or operational objectives  
on a personal or collective basis 
• Targets for each metric are set at the start of each financial year, taking account of  
the business strategy, performance in previous years, market expectations and the 
prevailing economic climate
• The greatest weighting will be given to financial performance; specifically, a minimum 
profit hurdle applies before any bonus is payable against any of the metrics
• The final bonus award is made at the Committee’s discretion. Subject to the overall 
maximum, the Committee may make appropriate adjustments to ensure that the bonus 
outcomes are a fair reflection of the underlying performance of the Company and may 
also take into account factors such as Group safety, operational performance, and 
personal performance
• Malus and claw back provisions apply, 
which means cash and share elements 
may be recouped in specific circumstances 
during the two-year period following the 
end of the financial year to which the  
bonus relates
• The discretionary Annual Bonus Plan 
applies to a broad population who have 
roles which allow them to contribute 
materially to the successful delivery  
of the Company’s annual performance 
objectives. The Annual Bonus Plan 
operates within a consistent framework  
for all participants, with financial targets 
typically set by reference to the business 
area that is most relevant to the 
employee’s role
• No changes to the policy for executive 
directors have been made in the year

• Awards over Tate & Lyle PLC shares may 
be made, at the Committee’s discretion, 
on an annual basis taking an individual 
executive’s contribution and performance 
into account
• Awards will only vest to participants  
if demanding financial performance 
requirements have been achieved over  
a period of at least three financial years 
commencing with the financial year  
in which the award is made
• The Committee has the flexibility to 
make awards of up to 300% of base

appropriate to ensure market 
competitiveness and taking account  
of the Company’s performance
• The award will lapse entirely if threshold 
performance targets are not achieved
• Only 15% of any award made to

• Awards are subject to the achievement of financial performance metrics which are 
confirmed by the Committee in advance of each new grant. Two performance metrics 
have applied to awards made since 2010, and equal weight has been given to each: 
 – Growth in adjusted diluted earnings per share from continuing operations (EPS) over 
the three-year performance period 
 – Adjusted return on capital employed (ROCE) achieved at the end of the  
performance period
• These metrics were selected because together they represent key determinants  
of shareholder value creation: measuring the effectiveness of strategic investment 
decisions and the quality of earnings generated. If material changes to the metrics  
or weightings are proposed, the Committee would consult with key shareholders  
in advance of making a new award
• Targets for each new award are carefully considered by the Committee ahead of the 
grant of awards in any year, to ensure these remain appropriately stretching over the 
three-year performance period, taking into account: the business strategy and 
long-term financial plan, market expectations and the prevailing economic climate
• Before any shares are released at the end of the performance period, the Committee 
must also be satisfied that the level of vesting determined by performance against these 
targets is justified by the broader underlying financial performance of the Company
• Malus and claw back provisions apply

 STRATEGIC REPORT FINANCIAL STATEMENTS GOVERNANCE USEFUL INFORMATION Status of previously approved 
Remuneration policy statements
It is intended that provisions consistent  
with previously disclosed directors’ 
remuneration policies and/or incentive plans 
previously approved by shareholders will 
continue to apply after the resolution to 
adopt the remuneration policy set out  
in this Policy Report is approved. Such 
provisions will allow, without limitation: 
• Contractual commitments entered into 
before the policy takes effect, or before  
an individual was subject to this policy on 
directors’ remuneration, to be honoured 
• The satisfaction of awards and/or 
commitments made in relation to 
short-term and long-term incentive plan 
awards (providing they were consistent 
with the policy in effect at the time the 
original award/commitment was made). 
Such arrangements shall remain in effect 
and be included in the current remuneration 
policy by reference, even if they are not 
specifically provided for within the policy set 
out in this Policy Report.
Executive directors’ external 
appointments 
The Board believes that the Company  
can benefit from executive directors holding 
external non-executive directorships. Such 
appointments are subject to approval by  
the Board and are normally restricted to  
one position for each executive director. 
Fees may be retained by the executive 
director concerned. 
Additional share plan disclosures
Potential impact of mergers and 
acquisitions or other corporate activity
In the context of a merger or acquisition,  
or other relevant corporate activity, any 
potential impact on the incentive plans 
would be specifically considered by the 
Committee. In such circumstances, the 
Committee retains the authority to vary the 
performance target or the vesting outcome 
to ensure that outcomes are equitable for 
both the participant and shareholders.
Change of control and voting
All of the Company’s share plans contain 
provisions relating to a change of control. 
Outstanding awards would normally vest 
and become exercisable on a change of 
control, subject to the satisfaction of any 
performance conditions at that time, and  
in proportion to the time served during  
the performance period.
Service contracts
The Company’s policy regarding  
executive directors’ service contracts  
and appointment terms is to take account  
of market practice, and to ensure that 
provisions in relation to notice periods  
or termination payments are not excessive,  
as well as to ensure that contracts provide 
appropriate protection for the Company,  
for example, in relation to restrictions on 
competition, solicitation of customers  
or employees, and the protection of 
intellectual property. 
Executive directors are employed under 
service contracts commencing on dates  
as follows: Javed Ahmed (Chief Executive) 
– 10 October 2009; Nick Hampton (Chief 
Financial Officer) – 1 September 2014. The 
contracts provide for six months’ notice from  
the executive and 12 months’ notice from  
the Company. 
Service contracts for executive directors  
and letters of appointment for the Chairman 
and non-executive directors are available  
for inspection at the Company’s  
registered office. 
Beyond the items disclosed in this Report, 
there are no further obligations on the 
Company which could give rise to a 
remuneration or loss of office payment  
to a director.
Policy on the terms of directors’ 
appointment
In order to ensure the continued growth  
and success of the business over time,  
the Company must have the flexibility to 
appoint new individuals to the Board, either 
by way of internal promotion or external 
appointment, on terms that are sufficient  
to attract and motivate individuals of the 
highest calibre.
Remuneration policy for the Chairman 
and non-executive directors
Terms of appointment
The Chairman and non-executive 
directors have letters of appointment and 
do not have service contracts or notice 
periods. Under the terms of their 
appointment, they are usually expected 
to serve on the Board for between three 
and nine years, subject to their re-
election by shareholders. The Company 
Chairman and non-executive directors 
receive a fee for their services, and do 
not participate in the Group’s incentive  
or pension schemes, do not receive any 
other benefits, and have no right to 
compensation if their appointment 
is terminated.
Chairman and non-executive  
directors’ fees
Non-executive directors’ fees (excluding  
the Chairman) are reviewed annually  
by the Chairman and executive directors 
of the Board. The Chairman’s fee is 
reviewed annually by the Committee 
(excluding the Chairman).
Aggregate fees depend on the 
responsibilities assumed by each 
non-executive director. A basic fee is 
paid to the Chairman, to the Senior 
Independent Director and to each 
non-executive director. In addition, 
supplemental fees are payable to each 
Committee chairman. Accordingly, 
supplemental fees are paid to the 
chairmen of the Audit, Corporate 
Responsibility, Remuneration 
Committees, and the Research Advisory 
Group, to reflect the extra responsibilities 
required by each of these positions. 
Increases in fees arising from the normal 
annual review will generally be limited to 
the market increase applicable to UK 
employees generally. However, a higher 
or lower increase may be awarded to 
ensure that fees paid are commensurate 
with those paid by other UK-listed 
companies over time and are set at a 
level to retain individuals with the 
necessary experience and ability to make 
a substantial contribution to the Group.
66 | Tate & Lyle PLC | Annual Report 2015
Directors’ Remuneration Report continued
GOVERNANCE  The following key principles describe our 
intended approach in these circumstances 
(and are consistent with the principles that 
apply to the broader employee population).
• The starting point for negotiating any 
package on appointment will be the 
structure of the annual package within  
the remuneration policy that has been 
approved by shareholders and is current 
at the time of the appointment.
• We will review the appropriateness of  
the total package (both fixed and variable 
elements), to ensure that it is appropriate 
in the context of relevant external market 
practice, the complexity and scope of  
the role, the particular needs and 
requirements of the Company at the time, 
internal relativities, and the appointee’s 
skills, experience and qualifications.
• To respond to specific circumstances  
and/or to allow for differences in practice 
over time and by location, the Committee 
accepts that employment benefits may 
need to be structured differently from  
the specific provisions in place for current 
directors. The Committee therefore retains 
flexibility to make appropriate adjustments 
in provision, as considered appropriate, to 
provide market-referenced benefits which 
are necessary or appropriate in the proper 
performance of the role, for example in 
relation to: healthcare and insurance; 
transport and security; and provision  
for retirement. 
• Where an appointment requires an 
individual to relocate, internationally  
or otherwise, the Company may agree  
to make payment(s) to offset certain 
expenses incurred as a consequence of 
relocation or may provide benefits in line 
with our global/domestic mobility policy, 
on appointment and on an ongoing basis, 
depending on the circumstances. Such 
benefits may include, without limitation: 
travel; relocation and tax-related 
assistance; and similar benefits  
on repatriation at the end of the term.
• The current policy provides for a maximum 
level of variable remuneration that is 
equivalent to 475% of base salary in the 
financial year of appointment. This is 
consistent with the aggregate current 
maximum award under the Annual Bonus 
Plan (including any deferred shares) and 
the maximum award value under our 
Performance Share Plan, although the 
balance between short-term and 
long-term elements may be different from 
the current policy, and awards may be 
made on different terms. 
• Where an internal candidate is appointed, 
contractual commitments that have been 
made prior to appointment to the Board, 
along with any benefits and/or incentive 
awards that have been awarded at that 
time, may remain in effect and be 
honoured, even if they would not 
otherwise be consistent with the 
shareholder-approved remuneration  
policy in effect at the time. 
• In order to secure the appointment  
of a suitable external candidate, the 
Committee retains the flexibility to provide 
additional compensation for the value of 
incentive awards or other benefits that are 
forfeited on leaving a former employer. In 
such circumstances, the Committee may 
make use of cash and/or shares, as it 
considers appropriate in the 
circumstances. The Committee will 
exercise careful judgement in formulating 
the terms on which such a compensatory 
award will be made, taking into account 
the form of award(s) that are forfeited,  
the timeframes over which they may 
otherwise have been earned and any 
performance conditions that would  
have applied. 
This policy is intended to enable the 
Committee to structure an offer on terms 
that it considers to be in the best interests  
of the Company and its shareholders. 
Depending on the circumstances, and  
any restrictions or requirements that may 
apply, the Company may consult with  
key shareholders as part of this process  
and/or disclose terms on which a  
new appointment is made through  
the Regulatory Information Service,  
or in the following Annual Report.
Policy on payments in connection  
with loss of office
It is the Company’s policy that executive 
directors are normally employed on 
contracts that provide for not more than  
12 months’ notice from the Company  
and at least six months’ notice from the 
executive. To protect the Company’s 
interests, restrictive covenants (non-
compete/non-solicitation) apply for a period 
of 12 months following termination, less  
any period of ‘garden leave’. The Chief 
Executive and Chief Financial Officer are 
each employed on contracts consistent with 
this policy.
The Committee’s policy in respect of the 
treatment of executive directors leaving the 
Company is summarised in this section.  
The key principles are that the framework  
is designed to support a smooth transition 
from the Company, encouraging an orderly 
transfer of responsibilities, and taking into 
account the interests of shareholders in 
securing the sustained performance of the 
business beyond the executive’s departure.
Termination for dishonesty or misconduct 
are circumstances in which the executive 
would retain the minimum contractual 
entitlements on departure (as described  
in column ‘A’ of the table on page 68), 
consistent with the need to avoid providing 
any element of reward for failure. An 
executive’s departure in compassionate 
circumstances such as death or permanent 
disability would generally result in the  
most beneficial terms being received  
(as described in column ‘B’ of the table  
on page 68). 
The terms that will apply if an executive 
departs from the Company in other 
circumstances would be considered at  
the Committee’s discretion and approved  
on a case-by-case basis, in keeping with  
the principles above. Such circumstances 
would potentially result in treatment that  
is more favourable than the minimum but  
no more generous than that which applies  
in the compassionate circumstances 
described above. 
Tate & Lyle PLC | Annual Report 2015 | 67  
 STRATEGIC REPORT FINANCIAL STATEMENTS GOVERNANCE USEFUL INFORMATION Summary of policy on payments in connection with loss of office
(A) Termination for dishonesty or misconduct (B) Death or permanent disability
Fixed elements of 
remuneration:
• Base salary
• Pension
• Benefits
Cash elements, including accrued holiday pay, are 
paid pro rata to the termination date. Non-cash 
benefits may continue to be provided until the 
termination date, or paid as a cash equivalent 
(based on the cost of provision) on a pro rata basis. 
Cash elements, including accrued holiday pay, are paid  
pro rata to the end of the relevant notice period. Non-cash 
benefits may continue to be provided until the end of the notice 
period, or paid as a cash equivalent (based on the cost  
of provision) on a pro rata basis.
Annual bonus 
awards
No discretionary bonus would be awarded in  
these circumstances. More generally, no 
discretionary bonus will normally be awarded 
unless an individual is in active employment on  
the payment date (for cash awards) and/or the 
award date (for deferred share awards).
Dishonesty or misconduct may lead to the 
operation of malus and/or claw back provisions 
within the terms of the plan.
Any discretionary bonus that is payable will be approved  
on a case-by-case basis by the Committee.
Any bonus will normally be pro-rated to reflect the portion  
of the financial year prior to cessation, and would be paid  
at the normal time, reflecting the extent to which the original 
performance targets have been met. 
However, within a discretionary bonus framework, the 
Committee retains the flexibility to approve the timing and 
amount of the bonus on some other basis.
Deferred share 
awards
Unvested deferred shares will lapse.
Vested awards that have not been transferred/ 
released/exercised prior to cessation will lapse.
Dishonesty or misconduct may lead to the 
operation of malus and/or claw back provisions 
within the terms of the plan.
Previously vested but unexercised awards may be released  
in the normal way.
In respect of unvested awards: 
• If a participant dies, a deferred bonus award will vest in full  
on that date
• In the event of permanent disability, a deferred bonus award  
will continue on its existing terms, unless the Committee 
exercises its discretion to approve the release of the award

In the event of a change of control, an award may, at the 
Committee’s discretion, be released on or prior to the event,  
or be exchanged for a replacement award with an acquiring 
company.

Unvested awards will lapse.
Vested awards that have not been transferred,

Dishonesty or misconduct may lead to the 
operation of malus and/or claw back provisions 
within the terms of the plan.
Previously vested but unexercised awards may be released 
during a period ending six months following cessation.
In respect of unvested awards:
• Awards made in prior years will remain in effect and, unless 
the Committee determines that awards should vest on some 
other basis, an individual may receive a proportion of the 
potential award depending on the extent to which the original 
performance conditions have been achieved at the end of the 
normal performance period
• Other than in the case of death or permanent disability, 
awards will generally be reduced to reflect the proportion of 
the performance period which has elapsed prior to cessation.
The same provisions apply in the event of a change of control, 
but for the fact that the achievement of performance conditions 
will be assessed when the change of control is effective.
Provision for 
payments in lieu of 
notice, and 
requirements for 
mitigation
The Company has the option to make a payment in lieu of notice in relation to the fixed elements of remuneration only 
(base salary, pension, and contractual benefits). Depending on the circumstances, such a payment may be subject  
to a duty of mitigation. The Chief Financial Officer’s contract gives the Company the contractual right to phase the 
payments and to reduce them if the executive mitigates his loss. 
Other elements of remuneration described in the table are not affected by these provisions.
1  Savings-related share options granted under the HMRC-approved Sharesave Plan will vest or lapse in keeping with HMRC regulations applicable to the 
circumstances at the relevant date.

Directors’ Remuneration Report continued
GOVERNANCE  In addition to contractual rights to any payment on loss of office, any employee, including executive directors, may have statutory and/or 
common law or other rights to certain additional payments, for example in a redundancy situation. Similarly, additional consideration may  
be provided, if necessary, to secure specific agreements following separation (for example an enhanced non-compete provision) that protect 
the Company’s interests.
Depending on the role and circumstances of departure, a director who has been relocated may be repatriated in accordance with previously 
agreed terms. The Company may pay some or all of the costs incurred by the executive in respect of legal, financial, outplacement or other 
relevant personal advisory services and/or expenses in connection with relocation. The Committee will approve such arrangements on a 
case-by-case basis, with a view to maintaining compliance with regulatory requirements and consistency with internal Company policies 
that may apply.

(details are given in the Annual Report on Remuneration). 
Consideration of shareholder views
The remuneration strategy and policy described here were established in 2010 following a review and extensive consultation with major 
shareholders. Shareholders overwhelmingly approved the continuing use of the Performance Share Plan as our long-term incentive  
at the AGM in 2012, and formally approved the Remuneration Policy at the AGM in 2014. 
The Committee (led by the Committee Chairman) engages with our major institutional shareholders each year specifically on remuneration 
topics, alongside the Board’s wider-ranging shareholder engagement programme. 
The Committee also receives regular updates on investors’ views and corporate governance matters. These lines of communication ensure 
that emerging best practice principles are factored into the Committee’s decision making during the year.
Statement of consideration of employment conditions elsewhere in the Company
The principles on which we base remuneration decisions for executives (as described on page 60) are broadly consistent with those on 
which we base remuneration decisions for all employees. In particular, the Committee takes into account the general pay and employment 
conditions of other employees of the Company when making decisions on executive directors’ remuneration. This includes considering  
the levels of base salary increase for employees below executive level, and ensuring that the same principles apply in setting performance 
targets for executives’ incentives as for other employees of the Group. The Committee also reviews information on bonus payments and 
share awards made to the broader management of the Group when determining awards and outcomes at executive director level.

Introduction
As explained on page 59, this Report sets out how our established remuneration policy has been implemented during the year. The Report 
also covers details relating to the composition and key responsibilities of the Remuneration Committee and provides more information on how 
our incentive plans have operated. 
Implementation of the remuneration policy in the financial year ending 31 March 2016
The Company intends to continue to operate within this approved directors’ remuneration policy for the financial year ending 31 March 2016.
Meetings during the year
The Remuneration Committee comprises independent non-executive directors and the Chairman of the Board. The Committee met five times 
during the year. In addition, the Committee held a review and planning meeting in January 2015, as referenced in the Chairman’s introduction 
on page 58. Membership and attendance during the year were as follows:

3 Robert Walker ceased to be a director and Chairman of the Remuneration Committee on 31 December 2014.
The Committee also met twice since the end of the financial year, and before the signing of the Annual Report. The Company Secretary serves 
as secretary to the Committee. The Chief Executive; the Executive VP , Human Resources; the VP , Global Compensation and Benefits; and the 
Executive VP , General Counsel are normally invited to attend meetings to assist the Committee, although none is present or involved when his 
or her own remuneration is discussed.
Main responsibilities of the Remuneration Committee 
The main responsibilities of the Committee include:
• Assessing the appropriateness of executive remuneration in the context of the Company’s strategy and priorities as well as overall 
competitiveness, taking into account data from independent, external sources
• Setting the detailed remuneration of the executive directors, designated members of senior management, and the Company Chairman  
(in consultation with the Chief Executive), including: base salary or fees; annual bonus; long-term incentives; benefits; and contractual terms
• Setting performance targets for awards made to senior executives under the Annual Bonus Plan and the long-term incentive plan, and 
reviewing performance outcomes
• Reviewing the broader operation of the Annual Bonus and Performance Share Plans, including participation and overall award levels
• Reviewing the effectiveness of the Committee on an annual basis.
The Committee has a formal calendar of items for consideration. The Committee’s terms of reference, which are reviewed annually,  
are available on the Company’s website, www.tateandlyle.com. 
Committee advisor
The Committee appointed Deloitte LLP as its external advisor following a review and competitive tender process during 2012. As part of  
its annual processes, the Committee considered and confirmed that advice received during the year from Deloitte LLP was objective and 
independent. Deloitte LLP is a signatory to the Remuneration Consultants’ Code of Conduct; this gives the Committee additional confidence 
that the advice received is objective and independent of conflicts of interest.
Fees charged by Deloitte LLP for the provision of remuneration advice to the Committee amounted to £65,650 for the year ended 31 March 2015, 
with fees being charged on a time incurred basis. During the year, Deloitte LLP also provided services to the rest of the Group on corporate 
finance, consulting, internal audit, systems, tax compliance and accounting.
Statement of shareholder voting 
Resolutions to approve the Directors’ Remuneration Policy Report and the Annual Report on Remuneration were passed at the AGM on  
24 July 2014. The voting outcome, which was disclosed following the AGM, was as follows:

Executive director changes during the year
Appointment of Nick Hampton as Chief Financial Officer
Nick Hampton’s appointment as Chief Financial Officer was announced on 24 June 2014, along with details of the remuneration terms on 
which he was appointed. Nick’s remuneration, benefits and incentives are consistent with the policy on directors’ remuneration approved  
by shareholders.
Consistent with our remuneration policy relating to the terms of directors’ appointment, as approved by shareholders, we have made 
provision to compensate Nick for specific short-term and long-term incentives given up by him as a consequence of him leaving his former 
employer. As announced at the time of his appointment, these compensatory awards comprised a one-off Restricted Stock Award (RSA) of 
£1,200,000 worth of shares in Tate & Lyle PLC (subject to employment and specified performance conditions) and an award of £1,440,000 
worth of shares in Tate & Lyle PLC (subject to the same EPS and ROCE performance conditions that are applicable to 2014 awards under 
Tate & Lyle PLC | Annual Report 2015 | 7 1  
 STRATEGIC REPORT FINANCIAL STATEMENTS GOVERNANCE USEFUL INFORMATION the Performance Share Plan). Nick joined the Board on 1 September 2014 and, in light of the matters covered in the trading updates issued  
on 23 September 2014 which had their origins prior to his arrival and the associated market reaction, the Committee re-considered the 
compensatory awards. Following consultation with a number of the Company’s largest shareholders which indicated a broad level of support, 
and in keeping with our shareholder approved policy in relation to the terms of directors’ appointments, the Company has agreed to make a 
restricted stock award to Nick with a face value of £700,000 on grant, to honour the agreed value of the compensatory awards. This award will 
vest following the announcement of results for the year ending 31 March 2017 . As a condition of the grant of this award, Nick will be required to 
surrender the award that was made over £1,440,000 worth of shares.
Tim Lodge 
As announced on 24 June 2014, and to enable an orderly transition of responsibilities, Tim Lodge stepped down as Chief Financial Officer  
on 31 August 2014 and ceased employment with the Group on 31 December 2014. Arrangements relating to his departure were disclosed  
at the time and are set out on page 75.
Base salary
Executive directors’ salaries are reviewed annually, with effect from 1 April. At the 2015 review, the Committee agreed executive director 
salaries for the year ahead, taking current market positioning into account. The average increase awarded to employees across the Group  
was approximately 3%.

and by the Chairman and the executive directors in respect of other non-executive directors’ fees. 
At the 2015 review, taking into account the competitiveness of current fees against the comparable market position, and the time commitment

Annual bonus
The bonus structure described here applied during the year ended 31 March 2015 and will be retained for the year ending 31 March 2016  
with a change to the cash metric, as described below.
The bonus focused performance on three objectives: profitability; sales performance; and cash conversion. Before any bonus is payable,  
a minimum level of profit has to be achieved by the Company, regardless of performance against other metrics. 
For each performance metric, there is a corresponding multiplier, which varies between threshold, target and stretch levels of performance. 
Once the minimum profit threshold is achieved, bonuses are calculated by applying the multipliers which have the effect of increasing or 
decreasing the value of the bonus depending on performance against each metric in turn. To achieve the maximum payout, performance 
against all three metrics must be at or above the stretch level.

Profit performance is the most important of the three metrics, so multipliers for the profitability factor are more heavily geared than for the other 
two metrics, that is, improvements in profitability have the greatest impact on bonus payments. All multipliers and their weightings are agreed 
by the Committee when targets are set at the start of the year, reflecting the importance of each of the metrics in the context of the progress 
made against the Company’s long-term business strategy.

The table below provides further information on each metric. The Board considers that bonus targets are commercially sensitive because 
they may reveal information about the business plan in the year ahead that may damage our competitive advantage, and accordingly does 
not disclose these on a prospective basis. However, we continue our practice of reporting the level of performance required to achieve 
maximum bonus for the year just ended relative to the prior year’s performance, and the level of performance actually achieved against 
those targets.

SPLENDA
®
 Sucralose pricing as 
well as exchange rate movements
Our average quarterly cash 
conversion cycle worsened by eight 
days, primarily as a result of higher 
inventories (driven by an increase  
in finished goods year on year) and 
higher receivables following the 
deployment of our upgraded IS/IT 
system in North America
Performance is measured on the basis of constant exchange rates for the Group’s continuing operations. The Committee reviews and 
approves the performance outcomes, considers the Group’s safety performance, and then may make adjustments on an exceptional basis 
to ensure that the results are a true reflection of the underlying strength and performance of the Company.
On the basis of these performance outcomes, no annual bonus (0% of base salary) was awarded by the Committee to either the Chief 
Executive or the Chief Financial Officer for the year ended 31 March 2015.
Arrangements for the coming year
As described above, this framework is retained for the year ahead, with a change to the cash metric. Having considered the effectiveness  
of the cash conversion cycle metric over the past few years, the Committee has agreed that targets for the year ahead will be set against 
Adjusted Group Operating Cash Flow. The Committee believes this simpler metric will have greater impact on promoting effective overall 
cash management in the business, and is more closely aligned with shareholders’ interests.
Deferral and malus/claw back provisions
Any bonus amount up to 100% of base salary is paid in cash. Any excess above 100% of base salary is paid in the form of deferred shares. 
The shares are released after two years subject to the executive director remaining in service with the Company, and carry the right to 
receive a payment in lieu of dividend between award and release.
Both the cash and share elements are subject to malus and claw back provisions for a period of 24 months following award, which mean 
that they may be recouped in whole or in part, at the discretion of the Committee, in the exceptional event that results were found to have 
been misstated or if an executive director commits an act of gross misconduct.
Long-term incentive – Performance Share Plan
The Performance Share Plan (PSP) was reviewed in 2010 to provide a long-term incentive that is consistent with the business strategy.  
We consulted with shareholders in detail at that time and again when we renewed the PSP on the same key terms in 2012. The PSP closely 
aligns executive directors’ and senior executives’ interests with the strategy and with the interests of shareholders over the long term, and  
is therefore an important component of the overall package. At the 2012 AGM, 98% of shareholder votes cast supported the resolution to 
approve the PSP .
Tate & Lyle PLC | Annual Report 2015 | 73  
 STRATEGIC REPORT FINANCIAL STATEMENTS GOVERNANCE USEFUL INFORMATION Maximum award level
Since the 2010 AGM, awards to executive directors and other senior executives have been granted at the discretion of the Committee, with 
flexibility for the Committee to make awards of up to 300% of base salary where necessary to ensure market competitiveness, while taking  
into account Company performance.
Performance conditions
The release of awards depends on the Group’s performance during the three-year performance period beginning on 1 April in the year  
of the award. For awards made since 2010, the performance conditions comprised two elements, explained in the table below, consistent 
with the principles established following the review and consultation with shareholders at that time.
Metric Adjusted diluted earnings per share (EPS) Adjusted return on capital employed (ROCE)
Definition Performance is measured by comparing the compound 
annual growth rate (CAGR) of the Company’s adjusted 
diluted EPS from continuing operations over the 
performance period against pre-determined targets
Performance is measured by the adjusted ROCE  
on continuing operations achieved at the end of the 
three-year performance period against the pre-
determined targets

1  The ROCE outcome may be adjusted downward in the event of an asset impairment (adding this back into capital employed); this is to encourage a prudent investment 
strategy. For this reason, in the event of there being an impairment of assets during the performance period, the ROCE figure for PSP purposes can be significantly 
lower than the unadjusted ROCE number reported in the Company’s accounts. In relation to the closure of Singapore, no adjustments have been made to the reported 
ROCE on the basis that the impairment is a non-cash item and the underlying investment has delivered strong cash returns to the business over the full life-cycle.
The Committee reviews the appropriateness of metrics and targets ahead of the grant of awards in any year to ensure these remain 
sufficiently stretching. In practice, no changes to the performance targets have been made since they were established in 2010, and 
accordingly shares awarded under the PSP in 2012, 2013 and 2014 may vest in accordance with the schedule set out in the table above.
Before any shares are released, the Committee must also be satisfied that the level of vesting determined by performance against these 
targets is justified by the broader underlying financial performance of the Company. 
2015 awards
As noted in the Chairman’s introduction, our review of current arrangements indicated that incentive awards require careful calibration  
of targets against the business strategy and outlook, to ensure their continued effectiveness.
On 21 April 2015, we announced a restructuring of our European and SPLENDA
®
 Sucralose businesses to establish a more focused 
company from which to accelerate the delivery of our strategy.
These actions improve our strategic positioning and are expected to improve our long-term outlook and ability to maximise returns in a 
competitive market. However, the structural and mid-term financial considerations will also impact the appropriateness of the performance 
conditions attached to future incentive awards. We therefore expect to review the PSP conditions that will apply for awards made in 2015,  
in keeping with our approved remuneration policy, and to consult with shareholders, as appropriate, later in the year.
2012 PSP awards vesting by reference to the period ended 31 March 2015 (audited)
PSP awards made in 2012 were dependent on EPS growth and ROCE targets as described above, with each condition applicable to half  
of the award. Performance against these conditions and the vesting outcome is indicated in the table below.

having taken into account financial 
performance in the round, he has waived  
his entitlement to the award.

Awards made under the PSP from 1 April 2013 are subject to malus and claw back provisions for a period following the vesting date and 
extending to the fifth anniversary following the date of grant. During this period, the Committee may determine that an award will lapse wholly 
or in part (or may require that a participant shall repay up to 100% of the value of any award that has vested by virtue of performance), in  
the event of circumstances including the following: material misstatement of financial results; misconduct which justifies, or could justify, 
summary dismissal of the participant; or if information has emerged which would have affected the value of the original award that was 
granted to a participant, or the level at which the performance conditions were judged to have been satisfied.

4 Tim Lodge stepped down as Chief Financial Officer and as a director on 31 August 2014 and ceased to be an employee of the Group on 31 December 2014.  
The amounts shown in the single figure table above relate to the period while he was in office as a director. Arrangements on departure were included in our 
announcement on 24 June 2014, and are set out below in detail.
5 Robert Walker ceased to be a director on 31 December 2014.
Total pension entitlements (audited)
Directors participate in arrangements that are defined contribution in nature. Contributions made to or in lieu of pension in respect of each 
director during the year are shown in the single figure table.
As a deferred member of the Group Pension Scheme, Tim Lodge’s total accrued pension from the Group Scheme at the end of the year 
amounted to £198,088 per annum (31 March 2014 – £193,340). The Scheme was closed to future accrual from April 2011; the year-on-year 
change relates only to the inflation-linked contractual uplift in deferred pension values that applies under the Scheme rules. Tim’s normal 
retirement date is the end of the month in which he attains age 62. No additional benefits arose when he ceased to be an employee of the 
Group on 31 December 2014.
Termination and loss of office and payments to past directors (audited)
As announced on 24 June 2014, and to enable an orderly transition of responsibilities, Tim Lodge stepped down as Chief Financial Officer 
on 31 August 2014 and ceased employment with the Group on 31 December 2014. As previously announced, Tim received his normal 
contractual remuneration until 31 December 2014, and received a contractual payment of salary in lieu of the six-month balance of his notice 
period from that date. Remuneration earned in the period to 31 August 2014 as a director is shown in the single figure table above. 
Remuneration relating to his employment in the period 1 September to 31 December 2014 amounted to £135,273 in salary, £4,896 in 
benefits, and £33,818 in pension contributions. The payment in relation to the balance of his notice period was £203,000.
As we announced at the time, and in keeping with our shareholder approved policy, the Committee determined that Tim would retain rights to 
previously granted PSP awards which may vest subject to the rules of the Performance Share Plan and the relevant performance criteria, on 
a time prorated basis reflecting the proportion of the three-year vesting period during which he was employed (as shown in the table on page 
77). The Committee has not exercised any discretion in relation to the assessment of performance conditions or the timing of such vesting.
There have been no other payments to past directors other than as disclosed in this Report. No loss of office payments have been made 
during the year.

1 Under the terms of the Plan approved by shareholders, the number of shares comprising an award in any year is calculated based on the average share price 
over the last three months of the preceding financial year, being 707.83 pence per share for the 2014 award. During the year, the Committee approved an award 
of 300% of salary, in accordance with our approved remuneration policy.
2 Performance conditions are described on page 74.
3 Savings-related share options are options granted under the HMRC-approved Sharesave Plan. Options are granted on the same terms to all participating 
employees, are not subject to performance conditions, and are normally exercisable during the six-month period following the end of the relevant three- or 
five-year savings contract. The exercise price per share for these shares under option is 510.00 pence, reflecting a 20% discount to market value permitted under  
HMRC rules, which is applicable to all participants. The share price value on the date of grant was 637.00 pence. 
4 These awards are the compensatory awards made in connection with Nick Hampton’s appointment, as previously disclosed to shareholders and described  
on page 72, being:
• A one-off ‘Share Award’ award of £1,440,000 worth of shares in Tate & Lyle PLC, subject to the same EPS and ROCE performance conditions that are 
applicable to 2014 awards under the Performance Share Plan
2
.
• A one-off ‘Restricted Share Award’ (RSA) of £1,200,000 worth of shares in Tate & Lyle, PLC vesting in two equal tranches on the first and second anniversary  
of appointment, subject to employment and specified performance conditions. 
 As these awards are intended to compensate for incentives forfeited with his previous employer, specific provisions were agreed at the time of Nick’s appointment 
in relation to the minimum value that may be realisable in the specific circumstances relating to a change in control prior to 31 March 2016. The performance 
conditions attached to the RSA relate to strategic and operational milestone activities agreed by the Committee, the detailed disclosure of which would be 
commercially sensitive at this time. 
 These awards have been made based on an average share price over the five days prior to the date of award, being 620.60 pence per share.
 As described on page 72, the Committee has agreed to make a restricted stock award to Nick, with a face value of £700,000 on grant, to honour the agreed 
value of the compensatory awards. This follows a consultation with our largest shareholders, which indicated broad support, and is in keeping with our 
shareholder-approved policy in relation to the terms of directors’ appointments. As a condition of the grant of this award, Nick will be required to surrender  
the share award shown in the table above that was made over £1,440,000 worth of shares.

1  This award, to compensate Javed Ahmed for certain long-term incentives given up by him as a consequence of leaving his former employer, is not subject to 
performance conditions. The shares were available to exercise from 1 October 2011, being the second anniversary of Javed Ahmed joining the Company, and 
will remain exercisable until 30 September 2017. Pending delivery, he receives a payment in lieu of dividend on these shares which is subject to the deduction  
of tax. In the event of a change in control, the shares would be delivered immediately.
2  The three-year performance period for these awards begins on the first day of the financial year in which the award is granted.
3  This award is subject to the same performance conditions as PSP awards made in 2009.
4  This award is subject to the same performance conditions as PSP awards made in 2010.
5 This award is subject to the same performance conditions as PSP awards made in 2011.
6 This award vested by 67.7%, based on the achievement of adjusted diluted EPS growth, and adjusted ROCE performance, as described in the Annual Report 2014.
7 The performance conditions for PSP awards made in 2012, 2013 and 2014 are 50% adjusted diluted EPS and 50% adjusted ROCE, as described in this Report.
8 The PSP award made in 2012 will vest at just above threshold, following the Committee’s assessment of performance conditions (as described on page 74).  
As described on page 74, Javed Ahmed has informed the Committee that he has elected to waive his award.
9 Deferred shares are granted under the annual bonus scheme (as described on page 73). The full value of these awards has been disclosed previously in the 
emoluments table(s) in the relevant bonus year(s). For example, the values of deferred shares relating to performance in the year ended 31 March 2012 are 
included in the emoluments table for the year ended 31 March 2012 (contained within the Annual Report 2012). 
10 Tim Lodge’s awards have been adjusted to reflect the proportion of the performance period during which he was employed, and accordingly, this number 
represents the number of shares that are no longer capable of vesting.

 STRATEGIC REPORT FINANCIAL STATEMENTS GOVERNANCE USEFUL INFORMATION Statement of directors’ shareholding and share interests (audited)
Personal share ownership requirements (policy on executive share ownership)
The Committee and executive management believe that personal investment in Company shares is an important part of our overall 
remuneration framework. Material personal investment in Company shares serves to strengthen the long-term alignment of interests 
between senior executives and shareholders.
Our executive shareholding requirements are more demanding and extend to a greater number of senior executives in the Group when 
compared with similar UK-listed companies.
• The Chief Executive has a target share ownership requirement of four times base salary, and his shareholding currently exceeds  
this target. 
• The Chief Financial Officer has a target shareholding of three times base salary, to be achieved within five years of appointment. In this 
capacity, Tim Lodge’s shareholding exceeded this target. Nick Hampton joined Tate & Lyle in September 2014, and therefore has until 
September 2019 to meet this target.
• Other Executive Committee members are subject to the share ownership policy, with target holdings at three times salary. 
• This policy extends to a broader group of executives who have senior leadership roles within the Company. The shareholding targets  
for this group is equal to their base salary.
The Committee monitors progress against the share ownership requirements annually.
Directors’ interests (audited)
The interests held by each person who was a director during the financial year in the ordinary shares of 25 pence each in the Company  
are shown below. All of the interests set out in the table are beneficially held and no director had interests in any class of shares other than 
ordinary shares. The table also summarises the interests in shares held through the Company’s various share plans.

US$11,500; (£7 ,000) (2014 – US$14,000; 
£9,000) was also contributed by the  
Tate & Lyle Political Action Committee (PAC). 
Change of control
The Company has a committed bank facility 
of US$800 million, which matures in 2019. 
Under the terms of this facility, the banks 
can give notice to Tate & Lyle to prepay 
outstanding amounts and cancel the 
commitments where there is a change of 
control of the Company. The Company is 
the guarantor of a £200 million bond issue 
by its subsidiary, Tate & Lyle International 
Finance PLC, dated 25 November 2009, 
which is repayable in 2019. Under the terms 
of the bond issue, noteholders have the 
option to request an early repayment where 
there is a change of control of the Company. 
All of the Company’s share plans contain 
provisions relating to a change of control. 
Further information is on page 66.
Eight separate donations were made, the 
largest being of $2,500 and the smallest 
$500. The PAC is funded entirely by US 
employees. Employee contributions are 
entirely voluntary and no pressure is placed 
on US employees to participate. No funds are 
provided to the PAC by Tate & Lyle but under 
US law, an employee-funded PAC must bear 
the name of the employing company.
The Directors are responsible for preparing 
the Annual Report, the Directors’ 
Remuneration Report and the Financial 
Statements in accordance with applicable 
law and regulations.
Company law requires the Directors to 
prepare financial statements for each 
financial year. Under that law the Directors 
have prepared the Group Financial 
Statements in accordance with International 
Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as 
adopted by the EU, and the Parent 
Company Financial Statements in 
accordance with United Kingdom Generally 
Accepted Accounting Practice (United 
Kingdom Accounting Standards and 
applicable law). Under company law the 
Directors must not approve the financial 
statements unless they are satisfied that they 
give a true and fair view of the state of affairs 
of the Company and the Group and of the 
profit or loss of the Group for that period.
In preparing these financial statements,  
the Directors are required to:
• Select suitable accounting policies and 
then apply them consistently
• Make judgements and accounting 
estimates that are reasonable and prudent
• State whether IFRSs as adopted by  
the EU and, with regard to the Parent 
Company Financial Statements, applicable 
UK Accounting Standards have been 
followed, subject to any material 
departures disclosed and explained in  
the Group and Parent Company Financial 
Statements respectively
• Prepare the financial statements on  
the going concern basis unless it is 
inappropriate to presume that the 
Company will continue in business.
The Directors are responsible for keeping 
adequate accounting records that are 
sufficient to show and explain the Company’s 
transactions and disclose with reasonable 
accuracy at any time the financial position  
of the Company and the Group and enable 
them to ensure that the financial statements 
and the Directors’ Remuneration Report 
comply with the Companies Act 2006 and, 
as regards the Group Financial Statements, 
Article 4 of the IAS Regulation. They are also 
responsible for safeguarding the assets of 
the Company and the Group and hence for 
taking reasonable steps for the prevention 
and detection of fraud and other irregularities.
The Directors are responsible for the 
maintenance and integrity of the Company’s 
website. Legislation in the UK governing the 
preparation and dissemination of financial 
statements may differ from legislation in 
other jurisdictions.
Each of the directors, whose names and 
functions are listed on pages 44 and 45, 
confirm that, to the best of his or her 
knowledge:
• The Annual Report, taken as a whole, is 
fair, balanced and understandable and 
provides the information necessary for 
shareholders to assess the Company’s 
and the Group’s performance, business 
model and strategy
• The Group Financial Statements, which 
have been prepared in accordance with 
IFRSs as adopted by the EU, and the 
Parent Company Financial Statements  
in accordance with UK Accounting 
Standards, give a true and fair view of  
the assets, liabilities, financial position and 
profit of the Group and Parent Company 
• The Strategic Report and the Directors’ 
Report include a fair review of the 
development and performance of the 
business and the position of the Group, 
together with a description of the principal 
risks and uncertainties that it faces.
Disclosure of information to auditors
So far as each director is aware, there is  
no relevant audit information of which the 
Company’s auditors are unaware; and he  
or she has taken all the steps that he or she 
ought to have taken as a director in order  
to make himself or herself aware of any 
relevant audit information and to establish 
that the Company’s auditors are aware  
of that information. 
The Directors’ Report on pages 44 to 57 , 
pages 79 and 80 and pages 156 to the 
inside back cover and the Directors’ 
Remuneration Report from pages 58 to 78 
of this Annual Report were approved by  
the Directors on 27 May 2015.

Commodity risk
Refer to Notes 3, 18 and 19 in the Group financial 
statements.
The Group’s accounting policy for its US business is to mark 
to market its commodity positions at each balance sheet 
date, including forward sales and purchase contracts with 
customers and grain suppliers, and physical inventory,  
in line with common industry practice. The Group manages 
the commodity price risk on sales and purchase contracts 
by taking certain long and short positions of physical 
contracts, and through the use of derivative financial 
instruments, primarily futures and options contracts. This  
is an area of focus due to the complexity of the calculations 
and the judgement involved in the valuation of certain 
commodities, most notably co-products that do not have an 
actively traded futures market. These co-products include 
corn gluten feed, corn gluten meal and corn oil. Additionally, 
basis adjustments are made to certain commodity 
valuations to reflect market conditions, which necessitate 
further management judgement. 
The fair values of commodities pricing contracts were 
assets of £58 million and liabilities of £25 million. 
We understood and evaluated management’s process for managing the 
commodity price risk inherent within its commodity positions, and compared it to 
management’s underlying risk management and accounting policy. No matters 
were identified that would indicate the risk management and accounting policies 
are not being followed.
We obtained management’s forward pricing sheet for all commodities used in the 
fair value calculations. For those commodities with an actively traded market, we 
assessed the consistency of the forward prices with those published by the Chicago 
Mercantile Exchange or similar exchange. For those commodities where an active 
futures market does not exist (principally co-products) and for the basis adjustments 
made, we have understood and challenged management’s methodology for 
determining these valuations, including the inputs and assumptions used. To further 
assess the reasonableness of the estimated forward prices, we have performed 
trend analyses against similar market or exchange traded commodities and 
compared certain ratios of co-product prices against historical ratios. In addition to 
testing the forward price estimates, we have audited the calculations of the fair value 
and associated unrealised gains and losses on the commodity-based positions. We 
found that management’s forward price estimates and the calculation of fair value  
of these contract positions were reasonable and supported by market observable 
data, where appropriate. Where management had calculated values by reference  
to non-market observable data, we found that these were within acceptable ranges.
Where derivative financial instruments, including futures and options contracts  
with third-party brokers were used to manage the commodity price risk, we 
independently confirmed these positions with the brokerage houses, and 
recalculated the confirmed fair value of the positions held. We found that the fair 
values of these derivative financial instruments were supported by these 
confirmations and recalculations.
Report on the Group financial 
statements 
Our opinion
In our opinion, Tate & Lyle PLC’s Group 
financial statements (the ‘Group financial 
statements’) defined below:
• give a true and fair view of the state of the 
Group’s affairs as at 31 March 2015 and of its 
profit and cash flows for the year then ended;
• have been properly prepared in accordance 
with International Financial Reporting 
Standards (‘IFRSs’) as adopted by the 
European Union; and
• have been prepared in accordance with the 
requirements of the Companies Act 2006 
and Article 4 of the IAS Regulation.
What we have audited
The Group financial statements comprise:
• the consolidated statement of financial 
position as at 31 March 2015;
• the consolidated income statement and 
consolidated statement of comprehensive 
income for the year then ended;
• the consolidated statement of cash flows  
for the year then ended;
• the consolidated statement of changes  
in equity for the year then ended; and
• the notes to the consolidated financial

Our audit approach
Overview
Materiality
• Overall Group materiality: £10 million which 
represents 5% of profit before tax adding 
back the share of tax of joint ventures and 
associates and exceptional items, as defined 
in Note 2 in the Group financial statements.
Audit scope
• Our audit included full-scope audits of six 
reporting components (Tate & Lyle PLC,  
Tate & Lyle International Finance, the US 
Bulk Ingredients business, the US Speciality 
Food Ingredients business, Sucralose 
Singapore and Food Systems Germany) 
with specified audit procedures performed 
at a further 13 reporting components.
• Taken together, the components at which 
audit work was performed accounted for 
87% of consolidated sales and 66% of 
consolidated profit before tax and covered 
all components that individually contributed 
more than 15% of sales and profit before tax.
Areas of focus
• Commodity risk
• SAP implementation
• Uncertain tax positions
• Retirement benefit obligations
• Impairment of SPLENDA
®
 Sucralose assets
The scope of our audit and our areas  
of focus
We conducted our audit in accordance with 
International Standards on Auditing (UK and 
Ireland) (‘ISAs (UK & Ireland)’).
We designed our audit by determining 
materiality and assessing the risks of material 
misstatement in the Group financial statements. 
In particular, we looked at where the Directors 
made subjective judgements, for example in 
respect of significant accounting estimates that 
involved making assumptions and considering 
future events that are inherently uncertain.  
As in all of our audits, we also addressed the 
risk of management override of internal controls, 
including evaluating whether there was evidence 
of bias by the directors that represented a risk  
of material misstatement due to fraud. 
The risks of material misstatement that had  
the greatest effect on our audit, including the 
allocation of our resources and effort, are 
identified as ‘areas of focus’ in the table below. 
We have also set out how we tailored our audit 
to address these specific areas in order to 
provide an opinion on the Group financial 
statements as a whole, and any comments we 
make on the results of our procedures should 
be read in this context. This is not a complete 
list of all risks identified by our audit.
For each area of focus below, where 
appropriate, we evaluated the design and 
tested the operating effectiveness of key 
internal controls over financial reporting, 
including testing the operation of IT systems 
from which financial information is generated.

GOVERNANCE STRATEGIC REPORT
Independent Auditors’ Report to the Members  
of Tate & Lyle PLC Area of focus How our audit addressed the area of focus
SAP implementation
The Group continues to rationalise and simplify its finance 
processes. As part of this, the Group has designed and 
developed a common SAP system. During the current year, 
this common system was implemented in the US Bulk 
Ingredients and US Speciality Food Ingredients businesses. 
These represent the two largest components of the  
Group audit.
The implementation introduced heightened risk as controls 
and processes that have been established and embedded 
over a number of years were updated and migrated into  
the new environment.
There was an increased risk of breakdown in internal 
financial controls during the transition and an increased  
risk of inaccurate or incomplete migration of financial data, 
which in turn increased the risk of material misstatements  
in the Group financial statements.
We understood and evaluated management’s project governance and data 
migration plan, and validated certain controls over the migration and go-live 
processes, and found these to be operating effectively. We understood and 
evaluated IT general controls and segregation of duties within the new 
environment. While IT general controls were largely operating effectively, we did 
not place reliance on automated controls in respect of managing segregation of 
duties risks, and instead we validated management’s mitigating manual controls 
which we found to be operating effectively.
In addition to the validation of management’s controls we also independently 
verified the migration of data for a sample of general ledger, sub-level and 
transaction level items. Based on the procedures performed, we did not identify 
any material unresolved matters in respect of the system implementation that  
had an impact on the Group financial statements.
Uncertain tax positions
Refer to Notes 3, 10 and 28 in the Group financial statements.
The nature of the Group’s multinational and cross-border 
operations exposes the Group to complicated tax 
regulations. This requires management to exercise 
judgement in determining the appropriate amount of tax  
to provide in a number of jurisdictions. In particular, certain 
financing arrangements that the Group has entered into, 
while not uncommon or unduly aggressive, have been 
previously subject to enquiry by tax authorities. Changes in 
management’s estimates of the likely result of enquiries by 
tax authorities could materially affect the quantum of tax 
provisions recognised in the Group financial statements.
Using our specialist tax knowledge, we evaluated and challenged management’s 
judgements in respect of estimates of tax exposures and contingencies in order 
to assess the adequacy of the Group’s tax provisions. This included obtaining a 
detailed understanding of the Group’s key technical tax matters and risks related 
to business and legislative developments.
We recalculated management’s valuations of direct tax provisions and 
determined whether the calculations were in line with the Group’s methodology 
and principles and whether they had been applied consistently with previous 
years. We also examined management’s ongoing analysis of its financing 
arrangements and considered recent correspondence with the tax authorities. 
From the evidence obtained, we considered the level of provisioning to be at  
the prudent end of an acceptable range.
Retirement benefit obligations
Refer to Notes 3 and 29 in the Group financial statements.
The Group has significant retirement benefit obligations in 
the UK and the US, including unfunded retirement medical 
plans in the US. At 31 March 2015 the present value of 
these obligations was £1,761 million (2014 – £1,525 million).
These obligations were determined based on a number of 
actuarial assumptions and calculations, which were subject 
to significant judgement and estimate. Changes in these 
assumptions can have a material impact on the quantum  
of obligations recognised.
We understood and evaluated the assumptions used by the Group’s actuaries 
and management in calculating the retirement benefit obligations for the defined 
benefit pension plans in the UK and the US, and the unfunded retirement medical 
scheme in the US.
We challenged each of the actuarial assumptions by comparing these to 
benchmark ranges based on market conditions and expectations at 31 March 
2015. In each case we found that the actuarial assumption used was reasonable, 
sat within our acceptable range, and was applied consistently with the prior year. 
In addition, we independently confirmed the pension assets held by the UK and 
US schemes with third-party investment custodians and fund managers. We did 
not identify any exceptions in this work.
Carrying value of SPLENDA
®
 Sucralose assets
Refer to Notes 6 and 37 in the Group financial statements.
As part of the re-focus and restructure of its SPLENDA
®
 
Sucralose business, the Group took the decision to write-off 
the assets of its Singapore facility in advance of the 
anticipated closure of this facility in Spring 2016. At the same 
time, given the continued competitive pricing pressure on 
this business, the Group undertook an impairment 
assessment of the carrying value of the SPLENDA
®
 
Sucralose assets at McIntosh, which had a carrying value of 
£103 million at 31 March 2015, which principally comprises 
property, plant and equipment and working capital.
We focused on this area, as the impairment review contains 
a number of significant judgements and estimates, of which 
the most significant is the anticipated future pricing the 
Group will achieve on sales of SPLENDA
®
 Sucralose.
Leveraging our specialist valuations knowledge, we obtained the Group’s 
impairment analysis and tested the reasonableness of key assumptions, including 
anticipated future pricing within the revenue assumption, the terminal growth rate 
applied and the determination of the discount rate. We challenged management 
to substantiate its assumptions, including considering the output of external 
advice the Group took as part of its strategic review of the SPLENDA
®
 Sucralose 
business.
We obtained and evaluated management’s sensitivity analyses to ascertain the 
impact of reasonably possible changes and we performed our own independent 
sensitivity calculations to quantify the downside changes to management’s model 
required to result in impairment. 
As a result of our work, we determined that the decision to fully write-off the 
Singapore facility at 31 March 2015 was appropriate and that management’s 
conclusion that the McIntosh facility was not impaired was also appropriate. We 
found that this judgement was supported by reasonable assumptions that would 
require significant downside changes before any impairment was necessary.

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
Independent Auditors’ Report to the Members  
of Tate & Lyle PLC continued How we tailored the audit scope
In identifying these areas of focus, we tailored the scope of our audit to ensure that we performed sufficient work to be able to issue an opinion  
on the Group financial statements as a whole, taking into account the geographic structure of the Group, the accounting processes and controls 
and the industry in which the Group operates.
The Group is primarily structured across two divisions; Speciality Food Ingredients and Bulk Ingredients, with a central support function. The 
Group financial statements are a consolidation of the Group’s reporting units, spread across these two divisions, which comprise the Group’s 
operating businesses and centralised functions covering more than 250 individual components.
In establishing the overall approach to the Group audit, we determined the type of work that needed to be performed at the reporting units by us,  
as the Group engagement team, or component auditors from other PwC network firms operating under our instructions. Where the work was 
performed by component auditors, we determined the level of involvement we needed to have in the audit work at those components to be able  
to conclude whether sufficient and appropriate audit evidence had been obtained as a basis for our opinion on the Group financial statements as  
a whole. This involvement included oversight visits and review of working papers at the Group’s significant components in the US and at the Global 
Shared Services audit in Poland, and attendance at clearance meetings. In addition, we met with component management in China and Singapore.
Materiality
The scope of our audit was influenced by our application of materiality. We set certain quantitative thresholds for materiality. These, together with 
qualitative considerations, helped us to determine the scope of our audit and the nature, timing and extent of our audit procedures and to evaluate 
the effect of any misstatements, both individually and on the financial statements as a whole. 
Based on our professional judgement, we determined materiality for the financial statements as a whole as follows:
Overall Group materiality £10 million (2014 – £15 million)
How we determined it 5% of profit before tax (£51 million) adding back the share of tax of joint ventures and associates  
(£14 million) and exceptional items (£142 million), as defined in Note 2 in the Group financial statements.
Rationale for benchmark applied The Group’s principal measure of earnings is adjusted profit before tax, which excludes exceptional 
items, amortisation of acquired intangible assets and net retirement benefit interest from profit before 
tax. The Group adjusts for exceptional items as it believes that doing so is necessary to provide an 
understanding of financial performance. We have not used adjusted profit before tax, as defined above, 
as our benchmark since the amortisation of acquired intangible assets and net retirement benefit 
interest are recurring items. Materiality is lower than last year due to the reduction in the Group’s profit.
We agreed with the Audit Committee that we would report to it misstatements identified during our audit above £750,000 (2014 – £1 million) as well 
as misstatements below that amount that, in our view, warranted reporting for qualitative reasons.
Going concern
Under the Listing Rules we are required to review the Directors’ statement, set out on page 33, in relation to going concern. We have nothing to 
report having performed our review.
As noted in the Directors’ statement, the Directors have concluded that it is appropriate to prepare the Group financial statements using the going 
concern basis of accounting. The going concern basis presumes that the Group has adequate resources to remain in operation, and that the 
Directors intend it to do so, for at least one year from the date the financial statements were signed. As part of our audit we have concluded that  
the Directors’ use of the going concern basis is appropriate.
However, because not all future events or conditions can be predicted, these statements are not a guarantee as to the Group’s ability to continue 
as a going concern.

Responsibilities for the financial 
statements and the audit
Our responsibilities and those of the 
Directors
As explained more fully in the Directors’ 
Statement of Responsibilities set out on page 
80, the Directors are responsible for the 
preparation of the Group financial statements 
and for being satisfied that they give a true and 
fair view.
Our responsibility is to audit and express an 
opinion on the Group financial statements in 
accordance with applicable law and ISAs (UK 
& Ireland). Those standards require us to 
comply with the Auditing Practices Board’s 
Ethical Standards for Auditors.
This report, including the opinions, has been 
prepared for and only for the Company’s 
members as a body in accordance with 
Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies Act 
2006 and for no other purpose. We do not,  
in giving these opinions, accept or assume 
responsibility for any other purpose or to  
any other person to whom this report is  
shown or into whose hands it may come  
save where expressly agreed by our prior  
consent in writing.
What an audit of financial statements 
involves
An audit involves obtaining evidence about  
the amounts and disclosures in the Group 
financial statements sufficient to give 
reasonable assurance that the Group financial 
statements are free from material 
misstatement, whether caused by fraud  
or error. This includes an assessment of: 
• whether the accounting policies are 
appropriate to the Group’s circumstances 
and have been consistently applied and 
adequately disclosed; 
• the reasonableness of significant accounting 
estimates made by the Directors; and
• the overall presentation of the Group 
financial statements. 
We primarily focus our work in these areas  
by assessing the Directors’ judgements 
against available evidence, forming our own 
judgements, and evaluating the disclosures  
in the Group financial statements.
We test and examine information, using 
sampling and other auditing techniques, to  
the extent we consider necessary to provide  
a reasonable basis for us to draw conclusions. 
We obtain audit evidence through testing  
the effectiveness of controls, substantive 
procedures or a combination of both. 
In addition, we read all the financial and 
non-financial information in the Annual Report 
to identify material inconsistencies with the 
audited financial statements and to identify 
any information that is apparently materially 
incorrect based on, or materially inconsistent 
with, the knowledge acquired by us in the 
course of performing the audit. If we become 
aware of any apparent material misstatements 
or inconsistencies we consider the 
implications for our report.
Other matter
We have reported separately on the Parent 
Company financial statements of Tate & Lyle 
PLC for the year end 31 March 2015 and on

Report that is described as having been 
audited.

USEFUL INFORMATION FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Tate & Lyle PLC | Annual Report 2015 | 8 9  
GOVERNANCE STRATEGIC REPORT
Consolidated Statement of Changes in Equity 1 Basis of preparation
Description of business
Tate & Lyle PLC (the Company) is a public 
limited company incorporated and domiciled  
in the United Kingdom. The Company’s  
ordinary shares are listed on the London  
Stock Exchange.
The Company, and its subsidiaries, joint 
ventures and associates (together ‘the Group’) 
provides ingredients and solutions to the food, 
beverage and other industries. The Group 
operates from more than 30 production 
facilities around the world. 
The Group’s continuing operations comprise 
two operating segments: Speciality Food 
Ingredients and Bulk Ingredients. Segment 
information is presented in Note 4.
Accounting period
The Group’s annual financial statements  
are drawn up to 31 March. These financial 
statements cover the year ended  
31 March 2015 with comparative amounts  
for the year ended 31 March 2014. The Group 
has also presented a statement of financial 
position as at 1 April 2013 following the 
adoption of IFRS 11 ‘Joint Arrangements’. 
Basis of accounting
The consolidated financial statements on 
pages 85 to 148 have been prepared on the 
going concern basis in accordance with 
International Financial Reporting Standards 
(IFRS) and related interpretations as adopted 
for use in the European Union and those parts 
of the Companies Act 2006 that are applicable 
to companies reporting under IFRS. The 
consolidated financial statements have been 
prepared under the historical cost convention, 
modified in respect of the revaluation to fair 
value of available-for-sale financial assets, 
derivative financial instruments, assets 
classified as held for sale and assets held  
by defined benefit pension plans.
The Group’s principal accounting policies are 
set out in Note 2.
Company financial statements
The Company has not adopted IFRS and 
prepares its separate financial statements  
in accordance with applicable law and UK 
Accounting Standards (UK GAAP). The 
Company’s separate financial statements  
are set out on pages 150 to 155.
Going concern
For the reasons set out on page 33, the 
Directors have adopted the going concern 
basis in preparing the Company’s and the 
Group’s financial statements.
Discontinued operations
In the Group’s financial statements, the  
results, assets and liabilities and cash flows  
of discontinued operations are presented 
separately from those of continuing 
operations. An operation is classified as 
discontinued if it is a component of the Group 
that: (i) has been disposed of, or meets the 
criteria to be classified as held for sale; and (ii) 
represents a separate major line of business  
or geographic area of operations or will be 
disposed of as part of a single co-ordinated 
plan to dispose of a separate major line of 
business or geographic area of operations.  
As the Eaststarch disposal transaction was 
not highly probable at the balance sheet date, 
the assets are not classified as held for sale. 
Continuing operations therefore include the 
results of Eaststarch. 
Fair value measurement
Fair value is the price that would be received 
from the sale of an asset, or paid to transfer  
a liability in an orderly transaction between 
market participants at the measurement date, 
regardless of whether that price is directly 
observable or estimated using another 
valuation technique. In estimating the fair value 
of an asset or a liability, the Group takes into 
account the characteristics of the asset or 
liability if market participants would take those 
characteristics into account when pricing the 
asset or liability at the measurement date. 
Fair value measurements are categorised into 
Level 1, 2 or 3 based on the degree to which  
the inputs to the fair value measurements are 
observable and the significance of the inputs  
to the fair value measurement in its entirety, 
as follows:
•  Level 1 inputs are quoted prices  
(unadjusted) in active markets for identical 
assets or liabilities that the entity can  
assess at the measurement date
•  Level 2 inputs are inputs, other than  
quoted prices included in Level 1, that  
are observable for the asset or liability  
either directly or indirectly
•  Level 3 inputs are unobservable inputs  
for the asset or liability.
Use of adjusted measures
Tate & Lyle presents adjusted performance 
measures including adjusted sales, operating 
profit, profit before tax and earnings per share 
that are used for internal performance analysis 
and incentive compensation arrangements for 
employees and are presented because they 
provide investors with valuable additional 
information about the performance of the 
business. For the periods presented, adjusted 
performance measures exclude, where 
relevant, exceptional items, the amortisation  
of acquired intangible assets, net retirement 
benefit interest and tax on those adjustments. 
Adjusted measures are also presented using 
proportionate consolidation reflecting the 
Group’s management of its joint ventures on 
an integrated basis with its subsidiaries. 
Adjusted performance measures reported by 
the Group are not defined terms under IFRS 
and may therefore not be comparable with 
similarly-titled measures reported by other 
companies. The Directors do not regard these 
measures as a substitute for, or superior to, 
the equivalent measures presented in 
accordance with IFRS.
Reconciliations of the adjusted performance 
measures to the most directly comparable 
measures presented in accordance with IFRS 
are presented in Note 41.
Accounting standards adopted during 
the year
In the current year, the Group has adopted  
a number of new or revised accounting 
standards that are outlined below. With the 
exception of the changes arising from the 
adoption of IFRS 11 ‘Joint Arrangements’,  
and IFRS 12 ‘Disclosure of Interests in Other 
Entities’ the Group’s principal accounting 
policies are unchanged compared with  
the year ended 31 March 2014. 
IFRS 10 Consolidated Financial 
Statements 
IFRS 10 replaces the parts of IAS 27 
‘Consolidated and Separate Financial 
Statements’ that deal with consolidated 
financial statements and SIC-12 ‘Consolidation 
– Special Purpose Entities’. IFRS 10 
establishes a single control model for 
consolidation that applies to all entities, 
including special purpose entities.
IFRS 11 Joint Arrangements
With effect from 1 April 2014, the Group 
adopted IFRS 11 ‘Joint Arrangements’ which 
has significantly changed the basis of 
accounting for its interests in joint ventures 
while not affecting the Group’s earnings or  
net assets. 
Previously, the Group had accounted for its 
interests in joint ventures on a proportionate 
consolidation basis, whereby the Group’s 
share of the income and expenses, assets  
and liabilities and cash flows of joint ventures 
are combined on a line-by-line basis with 
those of Tate & Lyle PLC and its subsidiaries.  
IFRS 11 prohibits the use of proportionate 
consolidation and requires that joint ventures 
are accounted for using the equity method  
of accounting. Under the equity method of 
accounting, the Group’s share of the after tax 
profits and losses of joint ventures is shown on 
one line of the consolidated income statement, 
its share of their net assets is shown on one 
line of the consolidated statement of financial 
position and the consolidated statement of 
cash flows reflects cash flows between the 
Group and the joint ventures within cash flows 
from investing activities. 
Comparative amounts for 2014 have been 
restated on a consistent basis. An explanation 
and analysis of the effect of IFRS 11 on the 
Group’s financial information is presented in 
Note 42. In accordance with IAS 1, the Group 
has also presented a third statement of 
financial position as at 1 April 2013.
IAS 27 (Revised 2011) Separate Financial 
Statements 
IAS 27 (Revised 2011) now only deals with the 
requirements to prepare separate financial 
statements because the requirements to 
prepare consolidated financial statements are 
now contained in IFRS 10. 
90 | Tate & Lyle PLC | Annual Report 2015
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements IAS 28 (Revised 2011) Investments in 
Associates and Joint Ventures
IAS 28 was revised as a consequence of the 
issuance of IFRS 11 in order to set out the 
requirements for the application of the equity 
method when accounting for joint ventures.
IFRS 12 Disclosure of Interests in Other 
Entities
IFRS 12 is a new standard that prescribes 
disclosure requirements for all forms of 
interests in other entities, including joint 
ventures and associates. 
• Interest in subsidiaries
  IFRS 12 requires disclosures for each of  
an entity’s subsidiaries that have material 
non-controlling interests. As of 31 March 
2015, the Group did not have any subsidiaries 
with a material non-controlling interest.
• Interest in Joint Ventures and Associates
  IFRS 12 has significantly changed the way 
that the Group presents and discloses 
information about its interests in joint 
ventures and associates. The disclosures for 
individual joint ventures and associates are 
more prescriptive than previously required by 
IAS 31 ‘Interests in Joint Ventures’, and IAS 
28 ‘Investments in Associates’. As presented 
in Note 16, for those joint ventures which are 
material to the Group, summarised financial 
information has been provided. The 
information disclosed reflects the amounts 
required to be presented in the financial 
statements of the joint ventures, together 
with the Group’s share of those amounts. 
Comparative amounts for 2014 have also 
been provided on a consistent basis.
Other standards
Amendment to IAS 32 Financial Instruments: 
Presentation on offsetting financial assets and 
financial liabilities. This amendment clarifies that 
the right of set-off must not be contingent on a 
future event. It must also be legally enforceable 
for all counterparties in the normal course of 
business, as well as in the event of default, 
insolvency or bankruptcy. The amendment also 
considers settlement mechanisms. 
Amendments to IAS 36 Impairment of Assets 
on the recoverable amount disclosures for 
non-financial assets. This amendment 
removed certain disclosures of the recoverable 
amount of CGUs which had been included in 
IAS 36 by the issue of IFRS 13.
Amendment to IAS 39 Financial Instruments: 
Recognition and measurement on the novation 
of derivatives and the continuation of hedge 
accounting. This amendment considers 
legislative changes to ‘over-the-counter’ 
derivatives and the establishment of central 
counterparties. Under IAS 39 novation of 
derivatives to central counterparties would 
result in discontinuance of hedge accounting. 
1 Basis of preparation
continued 
The amendment provides relief from 
discontinuing hedge accounting when 
novation of a hedging instrument meets 
specified criteria. 
2 Principal accounting policies
Basis of consolidation
(a) Subsidiaries
Subsidiaries are all entities (including 
structured entities) over which the Group has 
control. The Group controls an entity when the 
Group is exposed to, or has rights to, variable 
returns from its involvement with the entity and 
has the ability to affect those returns through 
its power over the entity. Subsidiaries are fully 
consolidated from the date on which the Group 
obtains control. They are deconsolidated from 
the date that control ceases. 
A non-controlling interest in a subsidiary 
represents the share of the net assets of the 
subsidiary that is attributable to the equity 
interest in the subsidiary that is not owned  
by the Group. 
The Group’s income and expenses, assets 
and liabilities and cash flows include those of 
each of its subsidiaries from the date on which 
the Company obtains control until such time 
as control is lost. Inter-company transactions, 
balances and unrealised gains on transactions 
between group companies are eliminated. 
Unrealised losses are also eliminated. When 
necessary, amounts reported by subsidiaries 
have been adjusted to conform with the 
Group’s accounting policies.
(b) Joint ventures
A joint venture is a contractual arrangement 
under which the Group and other parties 
undertake an activity that is subject to joint 
control, whereby strategic financial and 
operating policy decisions require unanimous 
consent of the Group and the other parties. 
The Group’s interests in joint ventures are 
accounted for under the equity method, 
whereby the Group’s share of the profit or loss, 
other comprehensive income and net assets 
are shown on one line of the relevant primary 
financial statements. 
Losses of a joint venture in excess of the 
Group’s interest in the entity are not 
recognised, except to the extent that the 
Group has incurred obligations or made 
payments on behalf of the joint venture. 
Unrealised profits or losses on transactions 
between the Group and its joint ventures are 
normally eliminated to the extent of the 
Group’s interest in the joint venture. Losses 
are, however, recognised in full where they 
represent a reduction in the net realisable 
value of a current asset or an impairment loss.
(c) Associates
An associate is an entity over which the Group 
has significant influence. Significant influence 
is the power to participate in financial and 
operating policy decisions but not to control  
or jointly control them. Significant influence 
generally exists where the Group holds more 
than 20% and less than 50% of the 
shareholders’ voting rights. Associates are 
accounted for under the equity method, 
whereby the Group’s share of the profit or loss, 
other comprehensive income and net assets 
are shown on one line of the relevant primary 
financial statements. 
Losses of an associate in excess of the 
Group’s interest in the entity are not 
recognised, except to the extent that the 
Group has incurred obligations or made 
payments on behalf of the associate. 
Unrealised profits or losses on transactions 
between the Group and its associates are 
normally eliminated to the extent of the 
Group’s interest in the associate. Losses  
are, however, recognised in full where they 
represent a reduction in the net realisable 
value of a current asset or an impairment loss.
Business combinations
A business combination is a transaction or 
other event in which the Group obtains control 
over a business.
Business combinations are accounted for  
using the acquisition method.
Goodwill arising in a business combination 
represents the excess of the sum of the 
consideration transferred, the amount of  
any non-controlling interest in the acquired 
business and, in a business combination 
achieved in stages, the fair value at the 
acquisition date of the Group’s previously  
held equity interest, over the net total of the 
identifiable assets and liabilities of the acquired 
business at the acquisition date. Any shortfall 
is recognised immediately as a gain in the 
income statement. 
Consideration transferred represents the  
sum of the fair values at the acquisition date  
of the assets given, liabilities incurred or 
assumed and equity instruments issued by  
the Group in exchange for control over the 
acquired business.
Acquisition-related costs are charged to the 
income statement in the period in which they 
are incurred.
Identifiable assets and liabilities of the acquired 
business are measured at their fair value at the 
acquisition date, except for certain items that 
are measured in accordance with the relevant 
Group accounting policy, including retirement 
benefit obligations and deferred tax assets  
and liabilities.
Any non-controlling interest in the acquired 
business is measured either at fair value or  
at the non-controlling interest’s proportionate 
share of the identifiable assets and liabilities  
of the business.
Tate & Lyle PLC | Annual Report 2015 | 91  
USEFUL INFORMATION FINANCIAL STATEMENTS GOVERNANCE STRATEGIC REPORT Put options issued by the Group over 
non-controlling interests are initially recognised  
as a liability measured at fair value with a 
corresponding charge directly to equity. 
Subsequently, the liability is measured at 
amortised cost using the effective interest 
method and changes in its carrying amount  
are recognised in the income statement.
Changes in the Group’s ownership interest in a 
subsidiary that do not result in a loss of control 
are accounted for within equity. Any gain or 
loss on loss of control is recognised in the 
income statement.
Foreign currency translation 
At entity level, transactions in foreign  
currencies are translated into the entity’s 
functional currency at the exchange rate ruling 
at the date of the transaction. Monetary assets 
and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies 
are translated at the exchange rate ruling at  
the period-end date. Currency translation 
differences arising at entity level are 
recognised in the income statement.
The consolidated financial statements are 
presented in pounds sterling which is the 
Company’s functional currency. 
On consolidation, the results of foreign 
operations are translated into pounds sterling  
at the average rate of exchange for the period 
and their assets and liabilities are translated 
into pounds sterling at the exchange rate ruling 
at the period-end date. Currency translation 
differences arising on consolidation are 
recognised in other comprehensive income  
and taken to the currency translation reserve. 
Goodwill and fair value adjustments arising  
on the acquisition of a foreign operation are 
treated as assets and liabilities of the foreign 
operation and translated accordingly. 
In the event that a foreign operation is sold,  
the gain or loss on disposal recognised in the 
income statement is determined after taking 
into account the cumulative currency translation 
differences arising on consolidation of the 
operation subsequent to the adoption of IFRS.
In the cash flow statement, the cash flows of 
foreign operations are translated into pounds 
sterling at the average exchange rate for 
the period.
Revenue recognition
(a) Sales of goods and services
Sales comprise the amount receivable in  
the ordinary course of business, net of value 
added and sales taxes, for goods and services 
provided. It comprises the fair value of the 
consideration received or receivable for the 
sale of goods and services. Sales are 
recognised at the point or points at which  
the Group has performed its obligations in 
connection with the contractual terms of the 
sales agreement, primarily at the point of 
delivering to the customer, and in exchange 
obtains the right to consideration.
2 Principal accounting policies
continued 
(b) Interest income
Interest income is recognised on a time-
proportion basis using the effective interest 
rate method.
(c) Dividend income
Dividend income is recognised when the right 
to receive payment is established.
Exceptional items
Exceptional items comprise items of income 
and expense, including tax items, that are 
material in amount and unlikely to recur and 
which merit separate disclosure in order to 
provide an understanding of the Group’s 
underlying financial performance. Examples of 
events giving rise to the disclosure of material 
items of income and expense as exceptional 
items include, but are not limited to, 
impairment events, significant business 
transformation activities, disposals of 
operations or significant individual assets, 
litigation claims by or against the Group and 
the restructuring of components of the 
Group’s operations. 
Borrowing costs
Borrowing costs directly arising from the 
purchase, construction or production of an 
asset are capitalised as part of the cost of 
that asset. 
Goodwill
Goodwill arising in a business combination  
is recognised as an intangible asset and is 
allocated to the cash-generating unit (CGU)  
or group of CGUs that is expected to benefit 
from the synergies of the business 
combination.
Goodwill is not amortised but is tested for 
impairment annually and whenever there are 
events or changes in circumstances that 
indicate that its carrying amount may not 
be recoverable.
Goodwill is carried at cost less any recognised 
impairment losses. 
Other intangible assets
Other intangible assets are stated at cost less 
accumulated amortisation and any recognised 
impairment losses. Other than goodwill, all 
intangible assets recognised by the Group 
have finite useful lives. 
(a) Acquired in business combinations
An intangible resource acquired in a business 
combination is recognised as an intangible 
asset if it is separable from the acquired 
business or arises from contractual or legal 
rights. Acquired intangible assets, for example, 
patents and customer relationships, are 
amortised on a straight-line basis so as to 
charge their cost, which represents their fair 
value at the date of acquisition, over the 
periods of their expected benefit to the Group, 
which are in the range three to 15 years.
(b) Other intangibles
Other intangible assets mainly comprise 
certain product development expenditure, 
marketing-related intangibles, computer 
software costs and capitalised costs relating 
to the common global IS/IT system.
Costs incurred on the development,  
design and testing of new or improved  
products are capitalised only when the 
technical and commercial feasibility of the 
product has been proven and prior to the 
product going into full production. Research 
and other development expenditures are 
charged to the income statement in the  
period in which they are incurred.
Other intangibles include marketing-related 
intangibles relating to several key customers.
Other intangible assets are amortised on a 
straight-line basis so as to charge their cost 
over the periods of their expected benefit to  
the Group, which are in the range of three to  
10 years.
Capitalised costs in respect of the global IS/IT 
system are being amortised over seven years.
Property, plant and equipment
Land and buildings mainly comprise 
manufacturing sites and administrative facilities. 
Plant and machinery mainly comprises 
equipment used in the manufacturing and 
operating process. Assets under the course  
of construction comprise property, plant and 
equipment which is in the process of being 
completed and not ready for use.
Property, plant and equipment is stated at 
historical cost less accumulated depreciation 
and impairment. Historical cost includes 
expenditure that is directly attributable to the 
acquisition of the items. Subsequent costs  
are included in the asset’s carrying amount  
or recognised as a separate asset, as 
appropriate, only when it is probable that 
future economic benefits associated with the 
expenditure will flow to the Group and the cost 
of the item can be measured reliably. All 
repairs and maintenance expenditures are 
charged to the income statement during the 
period in which they are incurred.
Depreciation is calculated using the straight-
line method to allocate the cost of each asset 
to its residual value over its useful economic 
life as follows:
Freehold land No depreciation 
Freehold buildings 20 to 50 years 
Leasehold property Period of the lease 
Bulk liquid storage tanks 12 to 20 years 
Plant and machinery 3 to 28 years
Residual values and useful lives are reviewed  
at each period-end date and adjusted if 
appropriate. An asset’s carrying amount is 
written down immediately to its recoverable 
amount if the asset’s carrying amount is 
greater than its estimated recoverable amount.
Gains and losses on disposals are determined 
by comparing the disposal proceeds with  
the carrying amount and are included in the 
income statement.

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements 
continued Leased assets
Leases of property, plant and equipment 
where the Group assumes substantially all the 
risks and rewards of ownership are classified 
as finance leases. Assets held under finance 
leases are capitalised at the lower of the fair 
value of the leased asset and the present  
value of the minimum lease payments. The 
corresponding leasing commitments, net  
of finance charges, are included in liabilities.
Leasing payments are analysed between 
capital and interest components so that the 
interest element is charged to the income 
statement over the period of the lease at a 
constant periodic rate of interest on the 
remaining balance of the liability outstanding.
Depreciation on assets held under finance 
leases is charged to the income statement,  
and depreciated over the shorter of the lease 
term and its useful life. All other leases are 
treated as operating leases with annual rentals 
charged to the income statement, net of any 
incentives granted to the lessee, over the term 
of the lease with incentives recognised over the 
period of the lease at a constant periodic rate.
Impairment of non-financial assets
Goodwill, other intangible assets and property, 
plant and equipment are tested for impairment 
whenever events or circumstances indicate 
that their carrying amounts may not be 
recoverable. Additionally, goodwill and 
intangible assets not subject to amortisation 
are subject to an annual impairment test.
An asset is impaired to the extent that its 
carrying amount exceeds its recoverable 
amount. An asset’s recoverable amount 
represents the higher of the asset’s value in  
use and its fair value less costs of disposal.  
An asset’s value in use represents the present 
value of the future cash flows expected to  
be derived from continued use of the asset.  
Fair value less costs of disposal is the  
amount obtainable from the sale of the asset  
in an arm’s length transaction between 
knowledgeable, willing parties, less the costs  
of disposal.
Where it is not possible to estimate the 
recoverable amount of an individual asset,  
the recoverable amount is determined for  
the CGU to which the asset belongs. An 
asset’s CGU is the smallest group of assets 
that includes that asset and generates cash 
inflows that are largely independent of the cash 
inflows from other assets or groups of assets. 
Goodwill does not generate cash inflows 
independently of other assets and is, therefore, 
tested for impairment at the level of the CGU or 
group of CGUs to which it is allocated.
Value in use is based on estimates of pre-tax 
cash flows discounted at a pre-tax discount 
rate that reflects the risks specific to the CGU 
to which the asset belongs.
Where necessary, impairment of non-financial 
assets other than goodwill is recognised before 
goodwill is tested for impairment. When 
goodwill is tested for impairment and the 
carrying amount of the CGU or group of CGUs 
to which it is allocated exceeds its recoverable 
amount, the impairment is allocated first to 
reduce the carrying amount of the goodwill and 
then pro-rata to the other non-financial assets 
belonging to the CGU or group of CGUs on  
the basis of their respective carrying amounts.
Impairment losses are recognised in the 
income statement. Impairment losses 
recognised in previous periods for assets other 
than goodwill are reversed if there has been  
a change in the estimates used to determine 
the asset’s recoverable amount, but only to the 
extent that the carrying amount of the asset 
does not exceed its carrying amount had  
no impairment been recognised in previous 
periods. Impairment losses recognised in 
respect of goodwill cannot be reversed.
Inventories
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and 
net realisable value with the exception of 
certain items of merchandisable agricultural 
commodities in the US which are stated at 
market value, in line with regional industry 
accounting practices.
Cost comprises direct materials and, where 
applicable, direct labour costs and those 
overheads that have been incurred in bringing 
the inventories to their present location and 
condition. Cost is calculated using the ‘first in/
first out’ or ‘weighted average’ cost methods, 
appropriate to the materials and production 
processes involved. Net realisable value 
represents the estimated selling price less all 
estimated costs to completion and costs to be 
incurred in marketing, selling and distribution. 
Provisions are made for any slow moving, 
obsolete or defective inventories.
Financial instruments
(a) Trade receivables
Trade receivables are recognised initially  
at fair value and subsequently measured at 
amortised cost using the effective interest 
method, less provision for impairment. A 
provision for impairment of trade receivables  
is established when there is objective evidence 
that the Group will not be able to collect all 
amounts due according to the original terms of 
the receivables. Significant financial difficulties  
of the debtor, probability that the debtor will 
enter bankruptcy or financial reorganisation, 
and default or delinquency in payments are 
considered indicators that the trade receivable 
is impaired. The amount of the provision is  
the difference between the asset’s carrying 
amount and the present value of estimated 
future cash flows, discounted at the original 
effective interest rate. The carrying amount  
of the asset is reduced through the use of an 
allowance account, and the amount of the loss 
is recognised in the income statement within 
operating expenses. When a trade receivable  
is uncollectable, it is written off against the 
allowance account for trade receivables. 
Subsequent recoveries of amounts previously 
written off are credited against operating 
expenses in the income statement.
(b) Trade payables
Non-current and current trade payables  
are recognised initially at fair value and 
subsequently measured at amortised cost 
using the effective interest rate method. 
(c) Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents include cash in 
hand, deposits held at call with banks and 
other short-term highly liquid investments with 
original maturities of three months or less and, 
for the purposes of the cash flow statement 
only, bank overdrafts where the legal right of 
offset exists.
(d) Available-for-sale financial assets 
and other financial assets
Equity instruments held by the Group and 
designated as available-for-sale are carried  
at fair value, with movements in fair value 
recognised in other comprehensive income. 
Where fair value cannot be reliably measured, 
the assets are approximated at cost. 
Cumulative fair value gains or losses on an 
asset are recycled through the income 
statement when the asset is disposed or 
impaired. A significant or prolonged decline  
in the fair value of a security below its cost is 
considered as an indicator that the securities 
are impaired. Impairments are recognised  
in the income statement. Other financial assets 
represent cash held in an escrow account and 
are carried at fair value.
(e) Borrowings
Borrowings are initially measured at fair value, 
net of transaction costs incurred. Borrowings 
are subsequently measured at amortised cost 
using the effective interest rate method, 
whereby any difference between the proceeds 
(net of transaction costs) and the initial fair 
value is recognised in the income statement 
over the period of the borrowings. As explained 
under ‘Hedge accounting’ (see following page), 
the carrying amount of a borrowing may be 
subject to adjustment where it is a hedged 
liability in a fair value hedge. 
Borrowings are classified as current liabilities 
unless the Group has an unconditional right  
to defer settlement of the liability for at least  
12 months after period-end date. 
Dividends on preference shares are recognised 
in the income statement as interest expense.
(f) Derivative financial instruments
The Group uses derivative financial instruments 
to reduce its exposure to commodity price, 
currency exchange rate and interest rate 
movements. The Group does not hold or issue 
derivatives for speculative purposes.
All derivative financial instruments held by the 
Group are recognised as assets or liabilities 
measured at their fair values at the period-end 
date. As explained under ‘Hedge accounting’ 
below, unless and to the extent that a 
derivative is in a designated and effective cash 
flow or net investment hedging relationship,

Tate & Lyle PLC | Annual Report 2015 | 9 3  
USEFUL INFORMATION FINANCIAL STATEMENTS GOVERNANCE STRATEGIC REPORT fair value gains and losses on derivatives are 
recognised in the income statement.
Derivative financial instruments that are not  
in a designated hedging relationship are 
classified as held for trading. 
(g) Embedded derivatives
Where an embedded derivative is not closely 
related to the host contract and where the 
host contract itself is not already recognised  
at fair value, movements in the fair value of the 
embedded derivative are separated from the 
associated transaction and, except where the 
embedded derivative is designated as a cash 
flow hedging instrument, recognised in the 
income statement.
(h) Offsetting financial instruments
Financial assets and financial liabilities are 
offset and the net amount presented in the 
statement of financial position where there  
is a legally enforceable right to offset the 
recognised amounts and there is an intention 
to settle on a net basis or realise the asset and 
settle the liability simultaneously.
Hedge accounting
For a hedging relationship to qualify for  
hedge accounting, it must be documented  
at inception together with the Group’s risk 
management objective and strategy for 
initiating the hedge and it must both be 
expected to be highly effective in offsetting the 
changes in cash flows or fair value attributed 
to the hedged risk and actually be highly 
effective in doing so.
(a) Cash flow hedges
Hedging relationships are classified as cash 
flow hedges where the hedging instrument 
hedges exposure to variability in cash flows  
that are attributable either to a particular risk 
associated with a recognised asset or liability 
(such as interest payments on variable rate 
debt), a highly probable forecast transaction 
(such as commodity purchases) or the foreign 
currency risk in a firm commitment (such as 
the purchase of an item of equipment).
Where a hedging relationship is classified as a 
cash flow hedge, to the extent that the hedge 
is effective, changes in the fair value of the 
hedging instrument are recognised in other 
comprehensive income rather than in the 
income statement. When the hedged item 
affects the income statement, the cumulative 
fair value gain or loss recognised in other 
comprehensive income is transferred to the 
income statement. When a hedged firm 
commitment results in the recognition of a 
non-current asset, the initial carrying amount  
of the asset is adjusted for the cumulative fair 
value gain or loss.
If the hedging instrument expires or is sold, or 
if the hedging relationship no longer meets the 
conditions for hedge accounting, the cumulative 
fair value gain or loss remains in equity until the 
forecast transaction is recognised in the income 
statement. If a hedged forecast transaction is 
no longer expected to occur, the cumulative 
fair value gain or loss is immediately transferred 
to the income statement.
(b) Net investment hedges
A net investment hedge is the hedge of the 
currency exposure on the retranslation of the 
Group’s net investment in a foreign operation.
Net investment hedges are accounted for 
similarly to cash flow hedges. Changes in the 
fair value of the hedging instrument are, to the 
extent that the hedge is effective, recognised  
in other comprehensive income.
In the event that the foreign operation is 
disposed of, the cumulative fair value gain or 
loss recognised in other comprehensive 
income is transferred to the income statement 
where it is included in the gain or loss on 
disposal of the foreign operation.
(c) Fair value hedges
Hedging relationships are classified as fair 
value hedges where the hedging instrument 
hedges the exposure to changes in the fair 
value of a recognised asset or liability that is 
attributable to a particular risk (such as the fair 
value of fixed rate debt).
Where the hedging relationship is classified as  
a fair value hedge, the carrying amount of the 
hedged asset or liability is adjusted by the 
change in its fair value attributable to the hedged 
risk and the resulting gain or loss is recognised 
in the income statement where, to the extent 
that the hedge is effective, it offsets the fair 
value gain or loss on the hedging instrument.
Provisions
A provision is a liability of uncertain timing or 
amount that is recognised when the Group 
has a present obligation (legal or constructive) 
as a result of a past event, it is more likely than 
not that a payment will be required to settle the 
obligation and the amount can be estimated 
reliably. 
Where the effect is material, the expected 
future payments are discounted using a 
pre-tax discount rate that reflects current 
market assessments of the time value of 
money and, where appropriate, the risks 
specific to the liability. The unwinding of any 
discount is recognised in the income statement 
within finance expense.
Provision is made for restructuring costs  
when a detailed formal plan for the 
restructuring has been determined and  
the plan has been communicated to those 
affected by it. Gains from the expected 
disposal of assets are not taken into account 
in measuring restructuring provisions.
Provisions are not recognised for future 
operating losses. 
Provisions are recognised for onerous 
contracts to the extent that the benefits 
expected to be derived from a contract are 
lower than the unavoidable cost to the Group 
of meeting its obligations under the contract. 
Income taxes
Current tax is the amount of tax payable or 
recoverable in respect of the taxable profit or 
loss for the period. Taxable profit differs from 
accounting profit because it excludes income 
and expenses that are recognised in the 
period for accounting purposes but are either 
not taxable or not deductible for tax purposes 
or are taxable or deductible in earlier or 
subsequent periods. Current tax is calculated 
using tax rates that have been enacted or 
substantively enacted at the period-end date.
Deferred tax is tax payable or recoverable on 
temporary differences between the carrying 
amount of an asset or liability in the financial 
statements and its tax base used in the 
computation of taxable profit. Deferred tax  
is accounted for using the liability method, 
whereby deferred tax liabilities are generally 
recognised for all taxable temporary 
differences and deferred tax assets are 
recognised to the extent that it is probable  
that taxable profits will be available in the 
foreseeable future against which deductible 
temporary differences can be utilised. 
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are not 
recognised if the temporary differences arise 
from the initial recognition of goodwill or from 
the initial recognition of other assets and 
liabilities in a transaction other than a business 
combination that affects neither accounting 
profit nor taxable profit.
Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for 
taxable temporary differences arising on 
investments in foreign subsidiaries and 
associates, and interests in joint ventures, 
except where the Group is able to control  
the reversal of the temporary difference and  
it is probable that it will not reverse in the 
foreseeable future.
Deferred tax is calculated using the enacted or 
substantively enacted rates that are expected  
to apply when the asset is recovered or the 
liability is settled. 
Current tax assets and liabilities are offset  
when there is a legally enforceable right to set 
off the amounts and management intends to 
settle on a net basis. Deferred tax assets and 
liabilities are offset when they relate to income 
taxes levied by the same taxation authority 
and the Group intends to settle its current tax 
assets and liabilities on a net basis.
Current and deferred tax is recognised in  
the income statement unless it relates to  
an item that is recognised in the same or a 
different period outside the income statement, 
in which case it too is recognised outside the 
income statement, either in other 
comprehensive income or directly in equity.

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements 
continued Retirement benefits
As described in Note 29, the Group operates 
pension plans in most of the countries in which 
it operates. Defined benefit pension plans are 
principally in the UK and the US and, until 
December 2013, were also in the Netherlands, 
and the Group operates a number of defined 
contribution pension plans. The Group also 
operates defined benefit retirement medical 
plans in the US.
(a) Defined benefit plans
A valuation of each of the defined benefit plans 
for accounting purposes is carried out 
annually at 31 March by independent qualified 
actuaries. Benefit obligations are measured 
using the projected unit credit method and  
are discounted using the market yields on high 
quality corporate bonds denominated in the 
same currency as, and of similar duration to, 
the benefit obligations. Plan assets are 
measured at their fair value at the period-end 
date. Where a plan holds a qualifying 
insurance policy, the fair value of the policy is 
deemed to be equivalent to the present value 
of the related benefit obligations. A deficit or 
surplus is recognised on each plan which 
represents the difference between the present 
value of the benefit obligation and the fair value 
of the plan assets. Where a plan is in surplus, 
the surplus recognised is limited to the present 
value of any amounts that the Group expects 
to recover by way of refunds or a reduction in 
future contributions. 
The defined benefit cost recognised in the 
income statement comprises the current 
service cost, any past service cost and the  
net interest on the deficit or surplus. Gains  
or losses on curtailments or settlements of  
the plans are also recognised in the income 
statement in the period in which the  
curtailment or settlement occurs. 
Remeasurements of the deficit or surplus are 
recognised in other comprehensive income. 
Current service cost represents the increase  
in the present value of the benefit obligation 
due to benefits accrued during the period, less 
employee contributions. Past service cost 
represents the change in the present value of 
the benefit obligation that arises from benefit 
changes that are applied retrospectively to 
benefits accrued in previous years. Any past 
service cost is recognised in full in the period  
in which the benefit changes are made. 
Net interest on the deficit or surplus is 
calculated by applying the discount rate that  
is used in measuring the present value of  
the benefit obligation to the deficit or surplus. 
Plan administration costs incurred by the 
Group are also recognised in the income 
statement. 
Remeasurements comprise differences 
between the actual return on plan assets (less 
asset management expenses) and the interest 
on the plan assets and actuarial gains and 
losses. Actuarial gains and losses represent 
the effect of changes in the actuarial 
assumptions made in measuring the present 
value of the benefit obligation and experience 
differences between those assumptions and 
actual outcomes. Actuarial gains and losses 
are recognised in full in the period in which 
they occur.
(b) Defined contribution plans
Contributions made by the Group to defined 
contribution pension schemes are recognised 
in the income statement in the period in which 
they fall due.
Share-based incentives
As described in Note 25, the Company 
operates share-based compensation plans 
under which it grants awards over its ordinary 
shares to its own employees and to those of 
its subsidiaries. All of the awards granted 
under the existing plans are classified as 
equity-settled awards. The Group recognises 
a compensation expense that is based on the 
fair value of the awards measured at the grant 
date using the Black-Scholes option pricing 
formula. Fair value is not subsequently 
remeasured unless relevant conditions 
attaching to the award are modified. 
Fair value reflects any market performance 
conditions and all non-vesting conditions. 
Adjustments are made to the compensation 
expense to reflect actual and expected 
forfeitures due to failure to satisfy service 
conditions or non-market performance 
conditions.
Generally, the resulting compensation expense 
is recognised in the income statement on  
a straight-line basis over the vesting period 
and a corresponding credit is recognised in 
equity. In the event of the cancellation of an 
award, whether by the Group or a participating 
employee, the compensation expense  
that would have been recognised over the 
remainder of the vesting period is recognised 
immediately in the income statement.
Dividends
Dividends on the Company’s ordinary  
shares are recognised when they have been 
appropriately authorised and are no longer at 
the Company’s discretion. Accordingly, interim 
dividends are recognised when they are paid 
and final dividends are recognised when they 
are declared following approval by 
shareholders at the Company’s AGM. 
Dividends are recognised as an appropriation 
of shareholders’ equity.  
Own shares
Own shares represent the Company’s ordinary 
shares that are held by the Company in treasury 
or by a sponsored Employee Benefit Trust that 
are used to satisfy awards made under the 
Company’s share-based incentive plans. When 
own shares are acquired, the cost of purchase 
in the market is deducted from equity. Gains  
or losses on the subsequent transfer or sale  
of own shares are also recognised in equity.
Assets held for sale 
An asset or group of assets is classified as held 
for sale if its carrying amount will be principally 
recovered through a sale transaction rather 
than through continuing use in the business,  
it is available for immediate sale in its present 
condition and management has committed to, 
and has initiated, a plan to sell the asset which, 
when initiated, was expected to result in a 
completed sale within 12 months. Assets that 
are classified as held for sale are measured at 
the lower of their carrying amount when they 
were classified as held for sale and their fair 
value less costs to sell. 
Accounting standards issued but not 
yet adopted
A number of new standards and amendments 
to standards and interpretations have been 
issued that are relevant to the Group but had 
not been adopted at 31 March 2015.
(a) IFRS 9 Financial instruments
IFRS 9 addresses the classification, 
measurement and recognition of financial 
assets and financial liabilities. The complete 
version of IFRS 9 was issued in July 2014.  
It replaces the guidance in IAS 39 that relates 
to the classification and measurement of 
financial instruments. IFRS 9 retains but 
simplifies the mixed measurement model  
and establishes three primary measurement 
categories for financial assets: amortised  
cost, fair value through other comprehensive 
income and fair value through the income 
statement. The standard is effective for 
accounting periods beginning on or after  
1 January 2018. Early adoption is permitted 
subject to EU endorsement.
(b) IFRS 15 Revenue from contracts with 
customers 
IFRS 15 deals with revenue recognition and 
establishes principles for reporting useful 
information to users of financial statements 
about the nature, amount, timing and 
uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising 
from an entity’s contracts with customers. 
Revenue is recognised when a customer 
obtains control of a good or service and  
thus has the ability to direct the use and  
obtain the benefits from the good or service. 
The standard will replace IAS 18 Revenue  
and IAS 11 Construction contracts and  
related interpretations. The IASB is  
considering deferring the adoption until  
at least 1 January 2018.
(c) IAS 19 Defined Benefit Plans: 
Employee Contributions (Amendments) 
The Amendments clarify how employee 
contributions that are linked to service should 
be attributed to periods of service and when 
such contributions may be treated as a 
reduction in the service cost that is recognised 
in the income statement. Subject to its 
endorsement for use in the EU, the Group  
will adopt the Amendments with effect from  
1 April 2015.

USEFUL INFORMATION FINANCIAL STATEMENTS GOVERNANCE STRATEGIC REPORT (d) Other pronouncements
Various minor improvements to accounting 
standards arising from the IASB’s 2010-2012, 
2011-2013 and 2012-2014 review cycles. 
The directors do not expect that the adoption 
of the Standards listed above will have a 
material impact on the financial statements  
of the Group in future periods, except that 
IFRS 9 will impact both the measurement and 
disclosures of financial instruments and IFRS 15 
may have an impact on revenue recognition 
and related disclosures. Beyond the information 
above, it is not practical to provide a reasonable 
estimate of the effect of IFRS 9 and IFRS 15 
until a detailed review has been completed.
3 Critical accounting estimates  
and judgements
In order to prepare these consolidated financial 
statements in accordance with the accounting 
policies set out in Note 2, management has 
used estimates and judgements to establish 
the amounts at which certain items are 
recorded. Critical accounting estimates and 
judgements are those that have the greatest 
impact on the financial statements and require 
the most difficult, subjective and complex 
judgements about matters that are inherently 
uncertain. Estimates are based on factors 
including historical experience and 
expectations of future events that management 
believes to be reasonable. However, given the 
judgemental nature of such estimates, actual 
results could be different from the assumptions 
used. The critical accounting estimates and 
judgements are set out below.
Taxation
The Group operates in a large number of tax 
jurisdictions around the world. Tax regulations 
generally are complex and in some jurisdictions 
agreeing tax liabilities with local tax authorities 
can take several years. Consequently, at the 
period-end date, tax liabilities and assets are 
based on management’s best estimate of the 
future amounts that will be settled. While the 
Group aims to ensure that the estimates 
recorded are accurate, the actual amounts 
could be different from those expected.
Deferred tax assets mainly arise from asset 
impairments and retirement benefit obligations 
that the Group expects to recover at some 
time in the future and by their nature the 
amounts recorded are therefore dependent on 
management’s judgement about future events.
Further details are set out in Notes 10 and 28. 
Derivatives and hedge accounting
The Group uses derivative financial 
instruments to reduce its exposure to 
commodity price, currency exchange rate and 
interest rate movements.
In particular, the Group uses corn and other 
commodity contracts to manage and hedge 
its corn book in the US. The US corn book 
comprises the commodity contracts, inventory 
and contracts for the purchase and sale of 
corn and co-products, some elements of 
which are expected to mature in more than  
12 months’ time, and is measured at fair value 
at each period-end date. The valuation of the 
corn book, which is underpinned by a number 
of judgements, has a material impact on the 
reported results of the Group. 
At 31 March 2015, the Group recognised 
derivative assets of £92 million (including 
commodity pricing contracts of £58 million) 
and derivative liabilities of £40 million (including 
commodity pricing contracts of £25 million). 
The fair value of derivatives continually 
changes in response to changes in prevailing 
market conditions affecting future corn and 
other commodity prices, currency exchange 
rates and interest rates. Where practicable,  
the Group uses hedge accounting to mitigate 
the impact of changes in the fair value of its 
hedging instruments on the income statement, 
but the Group’s results may be affected by 
these fair value changes where hedge 
accounting cannot be applied or due to hedge 
ineffectiveness.
Retirement benefits
The Group operates defined benefit pension 
plans principally in the UK and the US and 
unfunded retirement medical plans in the US. 
Generally, a deficit or surplus is recognised  
on each plan which represents the difference 
between the present value of the benefit 
obligation and the fair value of the plan assets 
(any surplus may be restricted in certain 
circumstances). 
At 31 March 2015, the present value of the 
benefit obligations on the plans was  
£1,761 million (2014 – £1,525 million), including 
£69 million (2014 – £54 million) in respect of 
the unfunded medical plans. The present value 
of the benefit obligations is based on actuarial 
estimates of the future benefits that will be 
payable to the members of the plans. As such, 
the benefit obligations are based on a number 
of assumptions, changes to which could have 
a material impact on the reported amounts. 
With regard to the pension plans, the present 
value of the benefit obligations is most 
sensitive to the discount rate applied to the 
benefit obligations, assumed life expectancies, 
and expected future price inflation rates. At  
31 March 2015, a reduction in the discount rate 
of 100 basis points would have increased the 
obligations by £304 million, an increase of one 
year in life expectancy would have increased 
the obligations by £74 million, and an increase 
in future price inflation of 50 basis points would 
have increased the obligations by £78 million.
At 31 March 2015, the assets held by the 
pension plans amounted to £1,534 million  
(2014 – £1,305 million), of which £367 million 
(2014 – £346 million) comprised qualifying 
insurance policies. Plan assets are measured 
at their fair value at the period-end date. The 
fair values of qualifying insurance policies held 
by the plans are deemed to be equivalent  
to the present value of the related benefit 
obligations. Otherwise, the carrying amounts 
of the plan assets are affected more by market 
risks, including interest rate risk, and other 
risks than by assumptions made in estimating 
the fair values of unquoted assets. 
Whilst changes in the assumptions used in 
determining the present value of the benefit 
obligations will have an impact on the Group’s 
income statement through their effect on the 
service cost and the net interest on the deficit 
or surplus in the plans, most of the impact  
of such changes, together with fluctuations  
in the actual return on the plan assets, will be 
reflected in other comprehensive income.
Full details of the assumptions made, which 
are based on advice from the Group’s 
actuaries, are set out in Note 29.
Impairment of assets
Asset impairments have the potential to 
significantly impact operating profit. In order  
to determine whether impairments are 
required the Group estimates the recoverable 
amount of the asset. This calculation is usually 
based on projecting future cash flows over a 
five-year period and using a terminal value to 
incorporate expectations of growth thereafter. 
A discount factor is applied to obtain a present 
value (‘value in use’). The ‘fair value less costs 
of disposal’ of an asset is used if this results  
in an amount in excess of ‘value in use’.
Estimated future cash flows for impairment 
calculations are based on management’s 
expectations of future volumes and margins 
based on plans and best estimates of the 
productivity of the assets in their current 
condition. Future cash flows therefore exclude 
benefits from major expansion projects 
requiring future capital expenditure where  
that expenditure has not been approved  
on the dates the assets are tested.
Future cash flows are discounted using a 
discount rate based on the Group’s weighted 
average cost of capital, adjusted if appropriate 
for circumstances specific to the asset being 
tested. The weighted average cost of capital is 
impacted by estimates of interest rates, equity 
returns and market and country-related risks. 
The Group’s weighted average cost of capital  
is reviewed on an annual basis.
If the cash flow or discount rate assumptions 
were to change because of market conditions, 
the level of impairment could be different  
and could result in the asset impairment  
being increased or reversed, in part or in full,  
at a future date. Goodwill impairment is 
never reversed.
Sensitivities are performed around the  
discount rate and operating profit growth  
which are considered the critical assumptions  
in the review.
Further details are set out in Notes 14 and 15.

Provisions
The Group recognises a provision where a legal or constructive obligation exists at the period-end date and a reliable estimate can be made of the 
likely outcome. Where appropriate, future cash outflows that are expected to arise over a number of years are discounted to a present value using 
a relevant discount rate.
At 31 March 2015, provisions included amounts for insurance claims payable by the Group’s reinsurance company, legal matters, employee 
termination and other restructuring costs.
Although provisions are reviewed on a regular basis and adjusted for management’s best current estimates, the judgemental nature of these items 
means that future amounts settled may be different from those provided. Further details are set out in Note 30.
4 Segment information
Segment information is presented on a consistent basis with the information presented to the Board (the designated Chief Operating Decision 
Maker) for the purposes of allocating resources within the Group and assessing the performance of the Group’s businesses. Continuing operations 
comprise two operating segments: Speciality Food Ingredients and Bulk Ingredients. Central, which comprises central costs including head office, 
treasury and re-insurance activities, does not meet the definition of an operating segment under IFRS 8 ‘Operating Segments’ but no sub-total is 
shown for the Group’s operating segments in the tables below so as to be consistent with the presentation of segment information to the Board. 
Both segments are served by a single manufacturing network, and receive services from a number of global support functions. The segmental 
information presented in Note 4 and Note 8 reflects the allocation of assets and costs based on the most appropriate methodology in each case, 
consistently applied over time. 
The Board uses adjusted operating profit as the measure of the profitability of the Group’s businesses. Adjusted operating profit is, therefore,  
the measure of segment profit presented in the Group’s segment disclosures. Adjusted operating profit represents operating profit before specific 
items that are considered to hinder comparison of the trading performance of the Group’s businesses either year-on-year or with other businesses. 
During the years presented, the items excluded from operating profit in arriving at adjusted operating profit were the amortisation of acquired 
intangible assets and exceptional items. The Group has presented segment and adjusted financial information on a proportionate consolidation 
basis, as this reflects the management of its joint ventures on an integrated basis with the Group’s subsidiaries. The segmental classification of 
exceptional items is defined in Note 6. 
An analysis of total assets and total liabilities by operating segment is not presented to the Board but it does receive segmental analysis of net working 
capital (inventories, trade and other receivables, less trade and other payables). Accordingly, the amounts presented for segment assets and segment 
liabilities in the tables below represent those assets and liabilities that comprise elements of net working capital. The segment results were as follows:

Continuing operations
(a)   During the year, the Group completed the implementation of a common global IS/IT system, and recognised costs of £12 million (2014 –  
£14 million) which did not meet the criteria to be capitalised. These costs are classified within Central costs in each of the above disclosed 
periods. During the year, in total we incurred £22 million of costs associated with the implementation of the common global IS/IT system.  
This brings total expenditure on the project to £146 million, including £5 million of hardware, software and associated costs. 
(b)   As part of the major business re-alignment announced on 21 April 2015, the Group announced its intention to consolidate all SPLENDA
®
 
Sucralose production into our facility in the US, and close the Singapore facility which will not be cost competitive going forward. The Group 
recognised an impairment charge of £113 million within the Speciality Food Ingredients segment, comprising a full impairment of the property, 
plant and equipment (£108 million) and associated intangible assets (£5 million). In addition the Group incurred £5 million of one-off costs 
associated with the business re-alignment (primarily consultancy and redundancy costs) which were classified as Central costs.
(c)   The Group made a payment of £12 million in December 2014 to terminate distribution rights previously awarded to a third party to sell  
our crystalline fructose principally in Asia Pacific. The expense was recognised within the Speciality Food Ingredient segment. 
The tax impact on exceptional items was a £8 million credit (2014 – £9 million credit). Tax credits on exceptional costs are only recognised  
to the extent that losses incurred will result in tax recoverable in the future. 
Discontinued operations
The Group did not recognise any exceptional items in respect of discontinued operations during the year to 31 March 2015.
During the year to 31 March 2014, the Group recognised an exceptional tax credit of £28 million in discontinued operations (see Note 11) following 
the favourable resolution of outstanding tax matters associated with the starch facilities which formed part of the Group’s former Food & Industrial 
Ingredients, Europe segment.

The Group’s adjusted effective tax rate is sensitive to the geographic mix of profits and losses and reflects a combination of higher tax rates in 
certain jurisdictions such as the US, nil effective tax rates in the UK (due to brought forward tax losses) and in Singapore (due to having ‘pioneer 
status’ awarded by the government in 2008) and rates that lie somewhere in between, for example, in certain eastern European countries. Our tax 
rate is favourably affected by our internal financing which involves borrowing by our US operations from the UK, the interest on which has the effect  
of reducing the amount of tax payable in the US.
The Group’s adjusted effective tax rate on continuing operations, calculated on the basis of the adjusted income tax expense of £48 million  
(2014 – £60 million) as a proportion of adjusted profit before tax of £224 million (2014 – £322 million) was 21.2% (2014 – 18.5%).

Diluted
Diluted earnings per share is calculated by adjusting the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue to assume conversion of all 
potentially dilutive ordinary shares. Potentially dilutive ordinary shares arise from awards made under the Group’s share-based incentive plans. 
Where the vesting of these awards is contingent on satisfying a service or performance condition, the number of potentially dilutive ordinary shares 
is calculated based on the status of the condition at the end of the period. Potentially dilutive ordinary shares are actually dilutive only when the 
average market price of the Company’s ordinary shares during the period exceeds their exercise price (options) or issue price (other awards).  
The greater any such excess, the greater the dilutive effect. The average market price of the Company’s ordinary shares during the year was 640p 
(2014 – 788p). The dilutive effect of share-based incentives was 3.8 million shares (2014 – 6.4 million shares).

(i) Impairment tests carried out during the year
Goodwill is tested for impairment annually and whenever there is an indication of impairment at the level of the cash-generating unit (CGU) or group  
of CGUs to which it is allocated. Tate & Lyle is principally managed as an integrated network in the United States and Europe, with a large amount  
of interdependency between plants servicing both the Speciality Food Ingredients and Bulk Ingredients segments. Goodwill is therefore tested  
for impairment on a geographical basis, except where it can be allocated to a specific CGU or group of CGUs.
A description of the impairment tests conducted in relation to the most significant goodwill amounts are set out on the following page. In each 
case, the recoverable amount was calculated based on value in use. Value in use was calculated based on budgets and plans covering the next 
five years that have been reviewed by the Board. Cash flows were projected during the five-year period based on budgeted operating profit and 
management’s expectations of market developments. Beyond the five-year plan, cash flows were generally assumed to grow at the long-term 
growth rate for the relevant geographical markets based on forecasts included in industry reports. Cash flows were discounted using pre-tax rates 
that are based on the Group’s weighted average cost of capital adjusted, where appropriate, to reflect differences between the risk profile of the 
geographical areas or CGUs concerned and that of the Group as a whole.

USEFUL INFORMATION FINANCIAL STATEMENTS GOVERNANCE STRATEGIC REPORT 14 Goodwill and other intangible assets continued
Goodwill allocated by geographical area
United States
Goodwill allocated to the US single ingredients operations of £62 million (2014 – £55 million) relates to the Staley acquisition in 1988. The key 
assumptions in the model are derived from the Group’s Annual Operating Plan for 2016, which includes mid-single digit volume growth in Speciality 
Food Ingredients and flat volumes in Bulk Ingredients. From 2017 onwards, volumes are projected to grow broadly in line with 2016 expectations, 
and operating profit is assumed to increase by 3% for Speciality Food Ingredients and 1% for Bulk Ingredients thereafter, based on management’s 
long term industry expectations. Cash flows were discounted using a pre-tax rate of 10.0% (2014 – 10.1%). Significant headroom exists and 
management concluded that no impairment is required. 
Goodwill allocated by operating segment
Speciality Food Ingredients
Goodwill allocated to the Speciality Food Ingredients segment includes £53 million (2014 – £61 million) that relates to the European Food Systems 
acquisitions of G.C. Hahn and Company in June 2007 and that of Cesalpinia Foods in December 2005. As these businesses are operationally 
integrated, they are tested for impairment as one CGU. The key assumptions in the model are derived from the Group’s Annual Operating Plan for 
2016, with mid-single digit operating profit growth assumed over a five year period. Cash flows were discounted using a pre-tax rate of 10.0% (2014 
– 10.1%). Management concluded that no impairment is required.
The only other CGU within the Speciality Food Ingredients operating segment with individually material goodwill is the Brazilian Food Systems 
business (Gemacom), which contains provisional goodwill of £24 million (see Note 36). Cash flows in 2016 are based on the Annual Operating Plan 
approved by the Board. Cash flows are then expected to grow at a compound annual rate of around 40% over the subsequent four years, and at 
5% thereafter reflecting the long-term growth rate for this market. Cash flows were discounted using a pre-tax rate of 16.7% (2014 – N/A). The value 
in use of this CGU exceeds its carrying value, and management concluded that no impairment is required.
There are no other individually material elements of goodwill allocated to either the Speciality Food Ingredients or Bulk Ingredients operating 
segments.
(ii) Possibility of impairment in the near future
Management considers that there is no reasonably possible change in one or more of the key assumptions used in the impairment tests for 
goodwill and other intangible assets that would give rise to an impairment loss during the coming year.
(b) Other intangible assets
Other intangible assets include capitalised development costs with a carrying amount of £72 million (net of impairment and amortisation) (2014 – 
£77 million) relating to the common global IS/IT platform. 
During the year, the system was successfully deployed across our US operations (having previously been deployed in our European Single 
Ingredient operations). As part of the major business re-alignment, the Group recognised a £5 million impairment charge relating to these assets in 
our SPLENDA
®
 Sucralose facility in Singapore. The charge was recognised as an exceptional item (see Note 6).

In December 2013, the Group completed the back-to-back purchase, sale and leaseback under an operating lease of its building at the global 
Commercial and Food Innovation Centre in Chicago, USA. The transaction generated a one-off gain of £6 million in the 2014 financial year, which 
comprised a gain of £3 million on the recognition of the remainder of the lease incentive on the original lease and a gain of £3 million on the sale of 
the property. The majority of the gain was included in the results of the Speciality Food Ingredients segment. 
Impairment reviews
As part of the major business re-alignment the Group recognised a £108 million impairment charge relating to the property, plant and equipment in 
our SPLENDA
®
 Sucralose facility in Singapore. The charge was recognised as an exceptional item (see Note 6). 
Management conducted impairment reviews of other property, plant and equipment during the year and concluded that there was no further 
impairment. 
Leased assets
Property, plant and equipment includes plant and machinery held under finance leases with a net book value of £10 million (2014 – £15 million).

Set out on page 115 is how the Group’s financial instruments measured at fair value, fit within the following fair value hierarchy:
• Quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1)
• Inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly (Level 2)
• Inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data (Level 3).
The following tables illustrate the Group’s net financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value at 31 March 2015 and 31 March 2014:

Level 1 financial instruments
The fair value of financial instruments traded in active markets (commodity futures) is based on quoted market prices at the period-end date.  
A market is regarded as active if quoted prices are readily and regularly available from an exchange, dealer, broker, industry group, pricing service,  
or regulatory agency, and those prices represent actual and regularly occurring market transactions on an arm’s length basis.
Level 2 financial instruments
The fair values of financial instruments that are not traded in an active market (interest rate swaps, cross currency swaps, commodity pricing 
contracts and forward foreign exchange contracts) are determined by using valuation techniques. These valuation techniques maximise the use  
of observable market data where it is available and rely as little as possible on entity-specific estimates.
The fair value of interest rate swaps, currency swaps and forward foreign exchange contracts is calculated as the present value of the future  
cash flows based on observable inputs drawn from interest yield curves sourced from a reputable third-party source.
Level 3 financial instruments
The fair value of financial instruments is based on unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity at the statement of financial 
position date. These inputs generally reflect the entity’s own assumptions about how a market participant would reasonably be expected to 
determine the price of a financial instrument.
For commodity pricing contracts, in evaluating the significance of fair value inputs, the Group generally classifies assets or liabilities as Level 3 when 
their fair value is determined using unobservable inputs that individually, or when aggregated with other unobservable inputs, represent more than 
10% of the fair value of the observable inputs of the assets or liabilities. An explanation of the key inputs used in calculating the fair value of these 
contracts is set out in Note 3 under the heading ‘Derivatives and hedge accounting’.
Available-for-sale financial assets which are analysed at Level 3 primarily represent investments in unlisted securities. The fair values of the unlisted 
securities are principally approximated at cost. Values are adjusted for permanent impairments and fair value movements as disclosed in Note 17.
For financial instruments in Level 3, the Group does not consider that changes to inputs to reasonable alternatives would have a material impact  
on the income statement or equity.

Gains and losses recognised in the hedging reserve in equity (Note 24) on forward foreign exchange and commodity pricing contracts at  
31 March 2015 are expected to be reclassified to the income statement at various dates until December 2016.
Fair value hedges
The Group employs interest rate swap contracts to hedge interest rate risks associated with its borrowings. The notional principal amounts of the 
outstanding interest rate swap contracts applied in fair value hedging relationships as of 31 March 2015 were £204 million (2014 – £345 million).
Net investment hedges
The Group employs currency swap contracts to hedge the currency risk associated with its net investments in subsidiaries located primarily  
in the US and Europe. The notional principal amounts of the outstanding currency swap contracts applied in net investment hedging  
relationships as of 31 March 2015 were £154 million (2014 – £147 million). Within net investment hedging gains/losses, a fair value loss of  
£7 million (2014 – £12 million gain) on translation of the currency swap contracts to pounds sterling at the period-end date was recognised  
in the translation reserve in shareholders’ equity (Note 24).
In addition, at 31 March 2015, of the Group’s borrowings, a total of £373 million (2014 – £456 million) are designated as hedges of the net 
investments in overseas subsidiaries.
Debt-related derivatives held for trading
Some of the Group’s interest rate swap contracts hedge the Group’s exposure to interest rate risk, but do not qualify for hedge accounting. The 
notional amounts of the outstanding interest rate swap contracts not designated within hedge relationships as of 31 March 2015 were £nil (2014 – 
£210 million).
Trading contracts
Commodity pricing contracts held for trading relate to the Group’s commodity trading activities which are undertaken for the purposes of 
supporting underlying operations. 
20 Financial risk factors
Management of financial risk
The key financial risks faced by the Group are credit risk, liquidity risk, and market risks, which include interest rate risk, foreign exchange risk and 
certain commodity price risks. The Board regularly reviews these risks and approves written policies covering the use of financial instruments to 
manage these risks and sets overall risk limits. The derivative financial instruments approved by the Board of Tate & Lyle PLC to manage financial 
risks include swaps, both interest rate and currency, swaptions, caps, forward rate agreements, foreign exchange and commodity forward 
contracts and options, and commodity futures.
The Chief Financial Officer retains the overall responsibility for management of financial risk for the Group. Most of the Group’s financing, interest 
rate and foreign exchange risk are managed through the Group treasury company, Tate & Lyle International Finance PLC, whose operations are 
controlled by its board. Group interest rate and currency exposures are concentrated either in the treasury company or in appropriate holding 
companies through market-related transactions with Group subsidiaries. Tate & Lyle International Finance PLC arranges funding and manages 
interest rate, foreign exchange and bank counterparty risks within limits approved by the Board of Tate & Lyle PLC.
Commodity price risks are managed through divisional commodity trading functions in the US and Europe. These functions are controlled by 
divisional management who are responsible for ratifying general strategy and overseeing performance on a monthly basis. Commodity price 
contracts are categorised as being held either for trading or for hedging price exposures. Commodity contracts held for trading within the Group 
are limited, confined only to tightly controlled areas within the corn pricing areas.
Market risks
Foreign exchange management
Tate & Lyle operates internationally and is exposed to foreign exchange risks arising from commercial transactions (transaction exposure),  
and from recognised assets, liabilities and investments in overseas operations (translation exposure).
Transaction exposure
The Group’s policy requires subsidiaries to hedge transactional currency exposures against their functional currency once the transaction is 
committed or highly probable, mainly through the use of forward foreign exchange contracts. The amounts deferred in equity from derivative 
financial instruments designated as cash flow hedges are released to the income statement and offset against the movement in underlying 
transactions only when the forecast transactions affect the income statement.

Tate & Lyle PLC | Annual Report 2015 | 11 7  
USEFUL INFORMATION FINANCIAL STATEMENTS GOVERNANCE STRATEGIC REPORT 20 Financial risk factors continued
Translation exposure
The Group manages the foreign exchange exposure to net investments in overseas operations, particularly in the US and Europe, by borrowing 
principally in US dollars and euro, which provide a partial match for the Group’s major foreign currency assets. The Group also manages some of 
its foreign exchange exposure to net investments in overseas operations through the use of currency swap contracts and borrowings. The amount 
deferred in equity from derivative financial instruments designated as net investment hedges is offset against the foreign currency translation effect 
of the net investment in overseas operations, and is released to the income statement upon disposal of those investments.
A weakening of the US dollar and euro against sterling would result in exchange gains on net debt denominated in these currencies which would 
be offset against the losses on the underlying foreign currency assets. 
At the year end, net debt amounting to £504 million (2014 – £353 million) was held in the following currencies: net borrowings of US dollars 105% 
(2014 – 112%), euro net deposits 1% (2014 – net deposits 2%), net borrowing of pounds sterling 1% (2014 – net deposits 9%) and other currencies 
net deposits 5% (2014 – net deposits 1%). The Group’s interest cost through the income statement is impacted by changes in the relevant 
exchange rates.
The following table illustrates only the Group’s sensitivity to the fluctuation of the major currencies on its financial assets and liabilities, as defined 
and set out in Note 18:

Sterling/US dollar 10% change 1 47 – 37
Sterling/euro 10% change 3 5 3 6
Interest rate management
The Group has an exposure to interest rate risk, arising principally from changes in US dollar, sterling and euro interest rates. This risk is managed 
by fixing or capping portions of debt using interest rate derivatives to achieve a target level of fixed/floating rate net debt, which aims to optimise net 
finance expense and reduce volatility in reported earnings. The Group’s policy is that between 30% and 75% of Group net debt (excluding the 
Group’s share of joint-venture net debt) is fixed for more than one year and that no interest rates are fixed for more than 12 years. At 31 March 2015, 
the longest term of any fixed rate debt held by the Group was until November 2019 (2014 – November 2019). The proportion of net debt at 31 
March 2015 (excluding the Group’s share of joint-venture net debt) that was fixed or capped for more than one year was 31% (2014 – 40%). 
The Group considers a 100 basis point change in interest rates a reasonably possible change except where rates are less than 100 basis points. In 
these instances it is assumed that the interest rates increase by 100 basis points and decrease to zero for the purpose of performing the sensitivity 
analysis. The impact is calculated with reference to the gross debt and cash held as at 31 March 2015 assuming that other variables remain 
unchanged.
As at 31 March 2015 if interest rates increase by 100 basis points, Group’s profit before tax will decrease by £3 million (2014 – no impact). If interest 
rates decrease by 100 basis points, or less where applicable, Group profit before tax will increase by £2 million (2014 – £1 million increase). 
Price risk management
Tate & Lyle participates mainly in four markets: food and beverage; industrial ingredients; pharmaceutical and personal care; and animal feed. Food 
and beverage and industrial ingredients are the most significant. All ingredients are produced from renewable crops, predominantly corn (maize).
Tate & Lyle is exposed to movements in the future prices of commodities in those domestic and international markets where the Group buys and 
sells corn (and related co-products) and energy for production. Commodity futures, forwards and options are used where available to hedge 
inventories and the costs of raw materials for unpriced and prospective contracts not covered by forward product sales. In most cases, these 
hedging contracts mature within one year and are either traded on recognised exchanges or over the counter.
The table below illustrates the sensitivity of the Group’s commodity pricing contracts as at 31 March to the price movement of commodities:

The majority of the Group’s commodity pricing contracts are held for trading and changes in mark-to-market values of these contracts are taken 
directly into the income statement. Amounts deferred in equity from commodity pricing contracts designated as cash flow hedges are released  
to the income statement and offset against the movement in underlying transactions when they occur.
Credit risk management
Counterparty credit risk arises from the placing of deposits and entering into derivative financial instrument contracts with banks and financial 
institutions, as well as credit exposures inherent within the Group’s outstanding receivables.
The Group manages credit risk by entering into financial instrument contracts only with highly credit-rated authorised counterparties which are 
reviewed and approved annually by the Board.

The Group has Board approved maximum counterparty exposure limits for specified banks and financial institutions based on the long-term credit 
ratings of Standard & Poor’s and Moody’s (typically single A long-term credit ratings or higher). Trading limits assigned to commercial customers 
are based on ratings from Dun & Bradstreet and Credit Risk Monitor. In cases where published financial ratings are not available or inconclusive, 
credit application, reference checking, and obtaining of customers’ financial information such as liquidity and turnover ratio, are required to evaluate 
customers’ credit worthiness.

Analysis of maximum credit exposure
Counterparties’ positions are monitored on a regular basis to ensure that they are within the approved limits and there are no significant 
concentrations of credit risks.
The Group considers its maximum exposure to credit risk at the year end date is as follows:

The Group’s trade receivables are short term in nature and largely comprise amounts receivable from business customers. Concentrations of 
credit risk with respect to trade receivables are limited due to the Group’s having a number of key quality customers and a customer base which  
is large, unrelated and internationally dispersed.

Liquidity risk management
The Group manages its exposure to liquidity risk and ensures maximum flexibility in meeting changing business needs, by maintaining access  
to a wide range of funding sources, including capital markets and bank borrowings. Capital market issues outstanding at 31 March 2015 include 
the US$250 million 6.625% 144A bond maturing in June 2016, and the £200 million 6.75% bond maturing in November 2019.
The Group ensures that it has sufficient undrawn committed bank facilities to provide liquidity back-up to cover its funding requirements for the 
foreseeable future. The Group has a core committed bank facility of US$800 million which was renewed in July 2014 and matures in July 2019. 
This facility is unsecured and contains common financial covenants for Tate & Lyle and its subsidiary companies that the pre-exceptional and 
amortisation interest cover ratio should not be less than 2.5 times and the multiple of net debt to EBITDA, as defined in our financial covenants, 
should not be greater than 3.5 times. The Group intends to refinance the core committed bank facility no later than 12 months prior to the facility’s 
maturity in July 2019. The Group monitors compliance against all its financial obligations and it is Group policy to manage the consolidated 
statement of financial position so as to operate well within these covenanted restrictions. In both the current and comparative reporting period,  
the Group complied with its financial covenants at all measurement points. The majority of the Group’s borrowings are raised through the Group 
treasury company, Tate & Lyle International Finance PLC, and are then on-lent to the business units on an arm’s length basis.
Current Group policy is to ensure that, after subtracting the total of undrawn committed facilities, no more than 10% of gross debt matures within 
12 months and at least 35% has a maturity of more than 2.5 years. At 31 March 2015, after subtracting total undrawn committed facilities, there 
was no debt maturing within 12 months (2014 – none) and 24% maturing within two and a half years (2014 – 29%). The average maturity of the 
Group’s gross debt was 4.2 years (2014 – 3.9 years). At the year end the Group held cash and cash equivalents of £195 million (2014 – £346 million) 
and had committed facilities of £539 million (2014 – £480 million) of which £539 million (2014 – £480 million) was undrawn. These resources are 
maintained to provide liquidity back-up and to meet the projected maximum cash outflow from debt repayment, capital expenditure and seasonal 
working capital needs foreseen for at least a year into the future at any one time.
The table below analyses the Group’s non-derivative financial liabilities and derivative assets and liabilities based on the remaining period at the 
statement of financial position date to the contractual maturity date. The amounts disclosed in the table are the contractual undiscounted cash flows.

Included in borrowings are £2,394,000 of 6.5% cumulative preference shares. Only one year’s worth of interest payable on these shares is included

Interest on borrowings is calculated based on borrowings held at year end without taking into account future issues. Floating-rate interest  
is calculated using forward interest rates derived from interest rate yield curves as at year end.
Derivative contracts include currency swaps, forward exchange contracts and interest rate swaps. All commodity pricing contracts such as options 
and futures are shown separately under commodity contracts.
Commodity contracts include only net settled commodity derivative contracts and gross settled commodity purchase contracts with negative fair 
values. Purchase contracts outflows represent actual contractual cash flows under the purchase contracts and not their fair values. Cash outflows 
from the purchase contracts are offset by cash inflows received from sale contracts; however, these inflows are not included as part of this analysis.
Financial assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than pounds sterling are converted to pounds sterling using year end exchange rates.

Capital risk management
The Group’s primary objectives in managing its capital are to safeguard the business as a going concern; to maintain the dividend policy; to 
maintain sufficient financial flexibility to undertake its investment plans and to retain as a minimum an investment grade credit rating which enables 
consistent access to debt capital markets. The Group’s financial profile and level of financial risk is assessed on a regular basis in the light of 
changes to the economic conditions, business environment, the Group’s business profile and the risk characteristics of its businesses.
Tate & Lyle has contractual relationships with Moody’s and Standard & Poor’s (S&P) for the provision of credit ratings, and it is the Group’s policy  
to keep them informed of all major developments. At 31 March 2015, the long-term credit rating from Moody’s was Baa2 (stable outlook) and from 
S&P was BBB (stable outlook). The Group is committed to maintaining investment grade credit ratings.
The Group regards its total capital as follows:

The Board has set two ongoing key performance indicators (KPIs) to measure the Group’s financial strength. The target levels for these financial  
KPIs are that the ratio of net debt/EBITDA should not exceed two times and interest cover should exceed five times. These ratios are calculated  
on the same basis as the external financial covenants noted above. The ratios for these KPIs for the financial years ended 31 March 2015 and

Allowance for doubtful debts
Trade receivables are subject to limited credit risk because the Group has a number of key customers of good credit quality and a large  
number of internationally dispersed customers. Trade receivables are regularly reviewed for collectibility and an allowance has been established for 
doubtful debts against which trade receivables are written-off when they are no longer considered to be collectible. Movements on the allowance 
for doubtful debts were as follows:

25 Share-based incentives
The Company operates share-based incentive arrangements for the executive directors, senior executives and other eligible employees under 
which awards and options are granted over the Company’s ordinary shares. All of the arrangements under which awards and options were 
outstanding during the 2015 and 2014 financial years are classified as equity-settled. During the year, the compensation expense recognised  
in profit or loss in respect of share-based incentives was £nil million (2014 – £8 million). 
Background
Performance Share Plan
The Group’s principal ongoing share-based incentive arrangement is the Performance Share Plan (PSP). Participation in the PSP is restricted  
to the executive directors and other senior executives. Awards made under the PSP normally vest provided the participant remains in the Group’s 
employment during the performance period and the Group achieves earnings per share (EPS) and return on capital employed (ROCE) targets.  
Up to 50% of each award vests dependent on the compound annual growth rate of the Group’s adjusted diluted EPS from continuing operations 
reaching specified levels over the performance period. Up to 50% of each award vests dependent on the Group’s adjusted ROCE from continuing 
operations reaching specified levels at the end of the performance period. The performance period is the period of three financial years beginning 
with the financial year in which the award is granted. During the 2015 and 2014 financial years, the Group recognised an expense in relation to 
share-based incentives that were awarded to the Chief Executive Officer in 2010 and 2011 that were subject to the same performance conditions 
that applied to awards made under the PSP in those years. From 2012, the Chief Executive Officer has participated in the PSP.
Further information on the PSP is set out in the Directors’ Remuneration Report on pages 58 to 78.
Group Bonus Plan – Deferred Element
Bonuses earned under the Group Bonus Plan are normally paid in cash up to 100% of the base salary of the participating executive. Any excess 
above 100% of base salary is paid in the form of deferred shares that are released after two years subject to the executive remaining in the Group’s 
employment. During the vesting period, payments in lieu of dividends are made in relation to the deferred shares. 
Further information on the Group Bonus Plan is set out in the Directors’ Remuneration Report.
Sharesave Plan
Options are granted from time to time under the Company’s Sharesave Plan, which is open to all employees in the UK. It offers eligible employees 
the option to buy shares in the Company after a period of three or five years funded from the proceeds of a savings contract to which they 
contribute on a monthly basis.
Executive Share Option Scheme
Options are outstanding under the Company’s legacy executive share option scheme. The last grant of options was made under this scheme in 
2004 and those options vested in 2007.
Restricted Share Awards
The Company has made restricted share awards to a number of eligible employees. Awards made normally vest provided the participant remains 
in the Group’s employment during the performance period and other conditions, specific to the individual awards are met.
Further information for these awards made in relation to executive directors are set out in the Directors’ Remuneration Report on page 58 to 78.

Credit facilities and arrangements
Tate & Lyle International Finance PLC holds a US$800 million five year committed multi-currency club facility with a core of highly-rated banks

28 Deferred tax
Deferred tax is calculated on temporary differences arising between the carrying amount of assets and liabilities for accounting purposes and  
their respective tax values. Deferred tax liabilities arise where the carrying amount is higher than the tax value (more tax deduction has been taken).  
This can happen where we invest in capital assets, as governments often encourage investment by allowing tax depreciation to be recognised 
faster than accounting depreciation. This reduces the tax value of the asset relative to its carrying amount. Deferred tax liabilities are generally 
provided on all taxable temporary differences. Deferred tax assets arise where the carrying amount is lower than the tax value (less tax benefit  
has been taken). This can happen where we have trading losses, which cannot be offset in the current period but can be carried forward and we 
consider it probable that we will be able to offset the losses against future taxable profits.
Movements in deferred income tax net assets/(liabilities) in the year are as follows:

At 31 March 2015 (28)
Of the amounts of deferred tax charged to the income statement and other comprehensive income, a charge of £nil million (2014 – £1 million) arose 
from changes in tax rates. There was no impact from the imposition of new taxes.
Deferred tax assets in respect of unutilised tax losses of £664 million (2014 – £614 million) have not been recognised to the extent that they exceed 
taxable profits against which these assets may be recovered. No unrelieved tax losses expired under current tax legislation in the year ended 
31 March 2015.
The total deferred tax on unremitted earnings is £3 million (2014 – £3 million) of which £nil (2014 – £nil) has been recognised. The Group has not 
recognised the amount as it is able to control the timing of the reversal of these temporary differences and it is probable that they will not reverse  
in the foreseeable future. The aggregate amount of temporary differences arising from unremitted profits at the period-end date was approximately 
£3 million (2014 – £3 million).
Other deferred tax liabilities principally relate to deferred tax on acquired intangible assets.
Other deferred tax assets principally relate to deferred tax on provisions.

(a) Plan information
(i) Pensions
The Group operates a number of defined benefit pension plans, principally in the UK and the US and, until December 2013, in the Netherlands. 
Generally, the pension benefits provided under these plans are determined based on the pensionable salary and period of pensionable service  
of the individual members. Most of the plans are funded and the plan assets held separately from those of the Group in funds that are under the 
control of trustees. The extent of the powers of the trustees, in particular in respect of funding and investment strategy, varies and is dependent  
on local regulations and the rules of each plan. Payments made by the Group to the plans principally comprise funding contributions agreed with  
the trustees that are determined in accordance with local regulations to ensure that appropriate funding levels are maintained and funding deficits  
are eliminated over a reasonable period of time. All of the significant defined benefit pension plans operated by the Group are closed to new 
entrants and most are closed to future accrual. 
The Group operates defined contribution pension plans in a number of countries. Contributions payable by the Group to these plans during the 
year amounted to £5 million (2014 – £3 million).       
(ii) Other benefits
The Group’s subsidiaries in the US provide unfunded retirement medical plans to the majority of their employees. Such plans provide financial 
assistance in meeting various costs including medical, dental and prescription drugs. Employees are required to contribute to the cost of benefits 
received under the plans. The Group meets the remaining costs of providing these benefits in the period in which they are incurred.

During the year ended 31 March 2014, the assets and liabilities of the defined benefit pension plan in the Netherlands were transferred to a new 
collective defined contribution plan and the defined benefit plan was closed. For accounting purposes, this transfer was treated as a settlement  
on which the Group recognised a gain of £4 million (of which £2 million was attributed to the Bulk Ingredients segment and £2 million was attributed  
to the Speciality Food Ingredients segment).

During the year ended 31 March 2014, the trustees of the Amylum UK Pension Scheme agreed a full buy-in of its benefit obligations at a cost of 
£82 million (which was partially funded by an additional contribution from the Group of £6 million). For accounting purposes, the related benefit 
obligation was valued at £69 million such that there was a loss on plan assets of £13 million.

(c) Defined benefit obligations
(i) Principal assumptions
Pensions
For accounting purposes, the benefit obligation of each plan has been calculated in accordance with IAS 19 based on data gathered for the most 
recent actuarial valuation and by applying assumptions made by the Group on the advice of independent actuaries. 
As required by local regulations, actuarial valuations of the US pension plans are carried out each year and those of the UK pension plans are 
carried out at least every three years. An actuarial valuation at 31 March 2013 of the Tate & Lyle Group Pension Scheme (Scheme) has been 
concluded. Under the new arrangements core funding contributions remain at £12 million per year. A new secured funding account was 
established where supplimentary contributions of £6 million per year will be made during the first six years, payable to the Trustee on certain 
triggering events such as under performance of the Scheme’s investments or a deterioration in the strength of Tate & Lyle’s financial covenant.  
The first two annual payments amounting to £12 million were credited to the secured funding account upon its establishment in October 2014 and 
have been accounted for as additional contributions to the Scheme in the second half of the year. An actuarial valuation of the Amylum UK Pension 
Scheme was last carried out at 30 June 2011.
Principal assumptions used in calculating the benefit obligation were as follows:
At 31 March 2015
UK US Other 
CPI 2.0%
Inflation rate RPI 3.0% 2.5% n/a
Expected rate of salary increases n/a 3.5% n/a
Expected rate of pension increases:
– Deferred pensions 2.0% n/a n/a
– Pensions in payment 2.8% n/a n/a

Expected rate of pension increases:
– Deferred pensions 2.4% n/a 1.6%
– Pensions in payment 3.2% n/a 1.6%
Discount rate 4.2% 4.3% 3.5%
Assumptions regarding future mortality rates of members of the Group’s pension plans are based on published statistics and taking into account 
the profile of the plan members. On this basis, the average life expectancies assumed for members of the plans are as follows:
At 31 March 2015 At 31 March 2014
UK US UK US 
Male aged 65 now 23 years 22 years 23 years 19 years
Male aged 65 in 20 years’ time 26 years 23 years 26 years 20 years
Female aged 65 now 24 years 24 years 24 years 21 years
Female aged 65 in 20 years’ time 27 years 25 years 27 years 22 years
Shorter longevity assumptions are used for members who retire on grounds of ill health.
Tate & Lyle PLC | Annual Report 2015 | 13 1  
USEFUL INFORMATION FINANCIAL STATEMENTS GOVERNANCE STRATEGIC REPORT 29 Retirement benefit obligations continued 
Medical benefits
Principal assumptions used in calculating the benefit obligation are medical cost inflation and the discount rate applied to the expected benefit 
payments. Management assumed medical cost inflation at 6.0% per annum (2014 – 6.0%), grading down to 5% by 2016, and used a discount rate  
of 3.5% (2014 – 4.1%).

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements 
continued 29 Retirement benefit obligations continued 
(d) Plan assets
(i) Investment strategy
Principal risks
The defined benefit pension plans expose the Group to actuarial risks such as interest rate, longevity, inflation and investment risk. 
Interest rate risk Inflation risk
Volatility in the financial markets can have a significant effect on the 
benefit obligation as the calculation of the obligation involves 
discounting based on yields on AA-rated corporate bonds. A 
decrease in the bond yield will increase the benefit obligation.
Inflation risk arises where pensionable salaries, deferred pensions or 
pensions in payment are subject to inflation increases. A higher rate of 
inflation will lead to a higher benefit obligation.
Longevity risk Investment risk
Longevity (or life expectancy) represents a risk because the longer 
members of the plans live the higher benefit payments to them will be. 
An increase in life expectancy beyond that assumed will increase the 
benefit obligation. 
If the return on the plan assets is lower than the discount rate applied 
to the benefit obligation, there will be an increase in the deficit (or 
reduction in the surplus) on the plan. 
Mitigation of risk
The Group encourages the trustees of the plans to adopt an investment policy that seeks to mitigate these risks, which involves investing a 
significant proportion of the plan assets in liability-driven investment portfolios that mitigate interest rate, inflation and investment risks. The Group 
seeks to ensure that, as far as is practicable, the investment portfolios of the funded plans are invested in long-term fixed interest securities with 
maturities and in currencies that match the expected future benefit payments as they fall due. In the UK, interest rate derivatives are used to 
achieve close matching where matching fixed-interest securities are not available in the market. Most of the inflation risk for the Group arises in the 
UK since deferred pensions and pensions in payment in the US do not attract inflation increases. Inflation risk is mitigated by holding index-linked 
government bonds and corporate bonds and, in the UK, inflation derivatives. At 31 March 2015, £367 million (2014 – £346 million) of the benefit 
obligation was matched by qualifying insurance policies that also mitigate longevity risk. The plans also maintain a portfolio of return-seeking 
investments, principally in the form of equities and property.

Employer contributions to the pension plans for the year ended 31 March 2015 were £48 million (2014 – £43 million). The Company also paid an 
additional £4 million (2014 – £4 million) to the US unfunded retirement medical plans to meet the cost of providing the benefits in the financial year. 
(e) Funding of the plans
A full valuation is performed by actuaries for the trustees of each plan to determine the level of funding required. Employer contributions are agreed 
between the trustees of each plan and the Group on the basis of these valuations. The assumptions used by the trustees for funding purposes may 
differ from the assumptions made by the Group for accounting purposes. As a result, the funding deficits or surpluses on the plans may be very 
different from the accounting deficits or surpluses. 
During the year ending 31 March 2016, the Group expects to contribute approximately £41 million to its defined benefit pension plans and to pay 
approximately £5 million in relation to retirement medical benefits.
(f) Sensitivity analysis
At 31 March 2015, the sensitivity of the net deficit on the plans to changes in the principal assumptions was as follows (assuming in each case that

performance bonds.
Sale of EU Sugars
As previously announced, American Sugar Holdings (ASR) raised a number of claims totalling in the region of £40 million that it believes it has  
under the Share and Business Sale Agreement relating to its acquisition of the Group’s EU Sugars business in September 2010. These claims in 
large part relate to the turbulence in the supply of raw sugar to the EU during the period prior to closing and the increase in certain rolling re-export 
commitments of the business. Some, but not all, of these issues were considered in the expert adjudication on the closing accounts in which,  
as noted in the 2012 Annual Report, the expert strongly supported Tate & Lyle’s position. ASR (through its subsidiary T&L Sugars Limited) has 
commenced formal proceedings in respect of these claims which the Group intends to defend vigorously. A trial of these proceedings was held  
in the Commercial Court in London in early May 2015, with the judge’s verdict expected later in the year.
Other claims
The Group is subject to claims and litigation generally arising in the ordinary course of its business, some of which are for substantial amounts. All 
such actions are strenuously defended but provision is made for liabilities that are considered likely to arise on the basis of current information and 
legal advice and after taking into account the Group’s insurance arrangements. While there is always uncertainty as to the outcome of any claim or 
litigation, it is not expected that claims and litigation existing at 31 March 2015 will have a material adverse effect on the Group’s financial position.

Acquisitions
On 1 August 2014, the Group completed its acquisition of the trade and assets of Winway Biotechnology Nantong Co., Ltd, a polydextrose 
producer in China. Total consideration was £8 million, of which £2 million has been deferred in escrow as security against a number of general 
warranties and representations detailed in the acquisition agreement. The provisionally determined fair value of net assets acquired totalled 
£5 million, with provisional goodwill of £3 million recognised.
On 4 December 2014, the Group acquired a 90% equity interest in Gemacom Tech Indústria E Comércio S.A., a leading Food Systems business  
in Brazil. The new venture, Tate & Lyle Gemacom (Gemacom), provides the Group with local infrastructure and capabilities to accelerate the growth 
of its Food Systems business in Brazil. At the acquisition date, the Group entered into put and call option arrangements, whereby at a future date it 
could be required to purchase, or could itself opt to purchase the remaining 10% equity interest in the company for a fixed £3 million option price 
(present value £2 million). In addition, deferred cash consideration of £9 million which is payable at the end of five years from acquisition date had 
been recognised at its present value of £6 million. No non-controlling interest was recognised as the risks and rewards of the ownership had been 
assumed by the Group. Contingent consideration of £2 million in relation to the expected profit share payable to the minority shareholders over five 
years from the acquisition date has been recognised, representing the present value of the relevant share of forecast profits of Gemacom for the 
next five years. Therefore, total consideration was £27 million (consisting of cash consideration of £19 million, deferred consideration of £6 million, 
and contingent consideration of £2 million). The contingent consideration has been disclosed as a ‘Level 3’ financial instrument (see Note 18). The 
fair value of net assets acquired totalled £5 million, with provisional goodwill of £24 million recognised.

Businesses acquired during the year contributed sales of £8 million and profit before tax of £nil to the Group’s results. Had they been acquired  
at the beginning of the year, the Group’s financial results would not have been materially different. 
Acquisition related costs were around £1 million.

Acquisitions
On 17 May 2013, the Group acquired a 100% equity interest in Biovelop, an early-stage Swedish manufacturer of oat beta glucan. The acquisition 
broadened the Group’s health and wellness offering and added an oat-based ‘clean label’, speciality fibre with strong health claims to its existing 
corn-based portfolio.
On 8 October 2013, the Group acquired a 51% equity interest in Jiangsu Howbetter Food Co., Ltd, a leading Food Systems business in China. 
The new venture, Tate & Lyle Howbetter, provides the Group with local infrastructure and capabilities to accelerate the growth of its Food Systems 
business in China. At the acquisition date, the Group entered into put and call option arrangements whereby at a future date it could be required 
to purchase, or could itself opt to purchase, the 49% non-controlling interest in Tate & Lyle Howbetter for an amount in cash based on the future 
results of that business. The Group initially recognised a liability of £2 million in relation to the put option and a corresponding debit to equity 
attributable to owners of the Company reflecting the non-controlling interests of the minority shareholders. Aggregate goodwill of £10 million was 
recognised on business combinations during the year which was determined as follows:

Cash flows:

Goodwill recognised during the year was attributable to the broadening of the Group’s product offering and other synergies expected to be 
achieved with the Group’s existing businesses. None of the goodwill recognised during the year is expected to be deductible for tax purposes.
Business acquired during the year contributed revenue of £2 million and a loss before tax of £2 million to the Group’s results. Had they been 
acquired at the beginning of the year, their contribution to the Group’s results would not have been materially different. 
Acquisition-related costs were less than £1 million. 
Disposal
On 31 May 2013, the on-sale by the acquirer of Orsan (a monosodium glutamate producer in which Tate & Lyle held a stake that was sold in 2009) 
resulted in a one-off operating gain of £3 million.

Major business re-alignment
Re-alignment of Eaststarch European joint venture
On 21 April 2015, the Group announced the exit from the substantial part of its European Bulk Ingredients business. Tate & Lyle and Archer Daniels 
Midland Company (ADM) signed an agreement to re-align Eaststarch C.V. (Eaststarch), their joint venture corn wet milling business in Europe in 
which each owns a 50% equity share. Eaststarch owns and operates three corn wet mills located in Slovakia, Bulgaria and Turkey, and has a 50% 
equity share in Europe’s largest corn wet mill in Hungary. Tate & Lyle will:
• Acquire full ownership of the plant in Slovakia
• Exit the predominantly Bulk Ingredients plants in Bulgaria, Turkey and Hungary which will be acquired by ADM
• Receive a cash sum of €240 million at closing, subject to customary closing adjustments, including for net cash and working capital, and an 
additional payment of up to €20 million in 2019 conditional on future corn and sugar pricing
• Continue to supply its European customers with crystalline fructose, a speciality sweetener, by being appointed as distributor for crystalline 
fructose produced from the plant in Turkey under a long-term agreement
• Appoint ADM as exclusive agent for Bulk Ingredients produced from the plant in Slovakia and Tate & Lyle’s wholly-owned corn wet mill in  
the Netherlands under a long-term agreement.
Completion is conditional upon regulatory clearances which are expected in the summer. Net cash proceeds from this agreement to be received 
by Tate & Lyle will be retained to provide flexibility to invest for growth in Speciality Food Ingredients. In the year ended 31 March 2015, Eaststarch 
had adjusted operating profit of £83 million, 23% lower than in 2014 reflecting lower EU sugar prices. The pro-forma impact on the adjusted income 
statement for 2015 (assuming the transaction occurred at 1 April 2014) is disclosed as additional financial information on page 158.

Re-focus and restructure SPLENDA
®
 Sucralose
On 21 April 2015, the Group announced that it had decided to consolidate SPLENDA
®
 Sucralose production into its facility in the US, and close  
its Singapore facility by Spring 2016. 
Exceptional cost impact of the business re-alignment
The re-structuring of the European Bulk Ingredients business is expected to give rise to a pre-tax exceptional profit on disposal of approximately 
£60 million subject to exchange rate movements and the timing of completion.
In total, exceptional charges of up to around £185 million will be recognised from these business re-alignment actions. These include charges of 
£118 million recognised in the year ended 31 March 2015, and a further exceptional charge to be recognised in the year ending 31 March 2016  
of around £65 million. These exceptional charges consist of:
• An exceptional charge of around £163 million for the re-structuring of the SPLENDA
®
 Sucralose business. This consists of £113 million for the 
impairment of the full carrying value of the Singapore facility recognised in the year ended 31 March 2015. The impairment charge comprises  
a full write-down of the property, plant and equipment (£108 million) and associated intangible assets (£5 million). Anticipated cash closure costs  
of up to £50 million will be recognised in the year ending 31 March 2016.
• An exceptional charge of up to £20 million in relation to the restructuring of our European operations to be predominantly recognised in the year 
ending 31 March 2016. This consists of up to £15 million of anticipated exceptional cash costs (of which £5 million have been recognised in the 
year ended 31 March 2015) and around £5 million of non-cash items.

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements 
continued 42 Adoption of IFRS 11 ‘Joint Arrangements’
With effect from 1 April 2014, the Group adopted IFRS 11 ‘Joint Arrangements’ which changed significantly the accounting for its interests in joint 
ventures. Before adoption of the standard, the Group’s interests in joint ventures were accounted for by proportionate consolidation, whereby the 
Group’s share of the income and expenses, assets and liabilities and cash flows of joint ventures were combined on a line-by-line basis with those 
of Tate & Lyle PLC and its subsidiaries. IFRS 11 prohibits the use of proportionate consolidation and requires that joint ventures are accounted for 
using the equity method of accounting. Under the equity method of accounting, the Group’s share of the after tax profits and losses of the joint 
ventures has been shown on one line of the consolidated income statement, its share of their net assets has been shown on one line of the 
consolidated statement of financial position and the consolidated statement of cash flows reflects cash flows between the Group and the joint 
ventures within cash flows from investing activities. While these changes have not affected the Group’s earnings or its net assets, they have 
affected many of the individual line items presented in the Group’s financial statements. In accordance with IAS 1, the Group has also presented  
a third statement of financial position (as at 1 April 2013) following the adoption of this accounting policy.
Comparative financial information for 2014 has been restated to adopt the new standard. An analysis of the effect of the impact on the Group’s 
results for 2015 and 2014 is presented below:

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements 
continued Report on the Parent Company 
financial statements
Our opinion  
In our opinion, Tate & Lyle PLC’s Parent 
Company financial statements (the ‘financial 
statements’):
• give a true and fair view of the state of the 
Parent Company’s affairs as at 31 March 
2015;
• have been properly prepared in accordance 
with United Kingdom Generally Accepted 
Accounting Practice; and
• have been prepared in accordance with the 
requirements of the Companies Act 2006.
What we have audited
Tate & Lyle PLC’s financial statements 
comprise:
• the Parent Company Balance Sheet as at  
31 March 2015; and
• the notes to the financial statements, which 
include a summary of significant accounting 
policies and other explanatory information.
Certain required disclosures have been 
presented elsewhere in the Annual Report, 
rather than in the notes to the financial 
statements. These are cross-referenced from 
the financial statements and are identified  
as audited.
The financial reporting framework that  
has been applied in the preparation of the 
financial statements is applicable law and 
United Kingdom Accounting Standards 
(United Kingdom Generally Accepted 
Accounting Practice).
In applying the financial reporting framework, 
the Directors have made a number of 
subjective judgements, for example in respect 
of significant accounting estimates. In making 
such estimates, they have made assumptions 
and considered future events.
Other required reporting
Consistency of other information
Companies Act 2006 opinion
In our opinion, the information given in the 
Strategic Report and the Directors’ Report  
for the financial year for which the financial 
statements are prepared is consistent with  
the financial statements.
ISAs (UK & Ireland) reporting
Under International Standards on Auditing  
(UK and Ireland) (‘ISAs (UK & Ireland)’) we are 
required to report to you if, in our opinion, 
information in the Annual Report is:
• materially inconsistent with the information  
in the audited financial statements; or
• apparently materially incorrect based on, or 
materially inconsistent with, our knowledge 
of the Parent Company acquired in the 
course of performing our audit; or
• otherwise misleading.
We have no exceptions to report arising from 
this responsibility.
Adequacy of accounting records and 
information and explanations received
Under the Companies Act 2006 we are 
required to report to you if, in our opinion:
• we have not received all the information  
and explanations we require for our audit; or
• adequate accounting records have not been 
kept by the Parent Company, or returns 
adequate for our audit have not been 
received from branches not visited by us; or
• the financial statements and the part of the 
Directors’ Remuneration Report to be 
audited are not in agreement with the 
accounting records and returns.
We have no exceptions to report arising from 
this responsibility.
Directors’ remuneration
Directors’ remuneration report – 
Companies Act 2006 opinion
In our opinion, the part of the Directors’ 
Remuneration Report to be audited has been 
properly prepared in accordance with the 
Companies Act 2006.
Other Companies Act 2006 reporting
Under the Companies Act 2006 we are 
required to report to you if, in our opinion, 
certain disclosures of Directors’ remuneration 
specified by law are not made. We have no 
exceptions to report arising from this 
responsibility. 
Responsibilities for the financial 
statements and the audit
Our responsibilities and those  
of the Directors 
As explained more fully in the Directors’ 
Statement of Responsibilities set out on page 
80, the Directors are responsible for the 
preparation of the financial statements and  
for being satisfied that they give a true and  
fair view.
Our responsibility is to audit and express  
an opinion on the financial statements in 
accordance with applicable law and ISAs  
(UK & Ireland). Those standards require us  
to comply with the Auditing Practices Board’s 
Ethical Standards for Auditors.
This report, including the opinions, has  
been prepared for and only for the Parent 
Company’s members as a body in 
accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of  
the Companies Act 2006 and for no other 
purpose. We do not, in giving these opinions, 
accept or assume responsibility for any other 
purpose or to any other person to whom this 
report is shown or into whose hands it may 
come save where expressly agreed by our 
prior consent in writing.
What an audit of financial statements 
involves
We conducted our audit in accordance with 
ISAs (UK & Ireland). An audit involves obtaining 
evidence about the amounts and disclosures 
in the financial statements sufficient to give 
reasonable assurance that the financial 
statements are free from material 
misstatement, whether caused by fraud  
or error. This includes an assessment of: 
• whether the accounting policies are 
appropriate to the Parent Company’s 
circumstances and have been consistently 
applied and adequately disclosed; 
• the reasonableness of significant accounting 
estimates made by the Directors; and 
• the overall presentation of the financial 
statements. 
We primarily focus our work in these areas  
by assessing the Directors’ judgements 
against available evidence, forming our own 
judgements, and evaluating the disclosures  
in the financial statements.
We test and examine information, using 
sampling and other auditing techniques, to  
the extent we consider necessary to provide  
a reasonable basis for us to draw conclusions. 
We obtain audit evidence through testing the 
effectiveness of controls, substantive 
procedures or a combination of both. 
In addition, we read all the financial and 
non-financial information in the Annual Report 
to identify material inconsistencies with the 
audited financial statements and to identify 
any information that is apparently materially 
incorrect based on, or materially inconsistent 
with, the knowledge acquired by us in the 
course of performing the audit. If we become 
aware of any apparent material misstatements 
or inconsistencies we consider the 
implications for our report.
Other Matter
We have reported separately on the Group 
financial statements of Tate & Lyle PLC for the 
year ended 31 March 2015.

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
Parent Company Balance Sheet 1 Principal accounting policies
Accounting basis
Tate & Lyle PLC (the Company) is a public 
limited company incorporated and domiciled  
in the United Kingdom. The Company’s  
ordinary shares are listed on the London  
Stock Exchange.
The Company’s financial statements are 
prepared under the historical cost convention  
in accordance with the Companies Act 2006 
and applicable UK accounting standards. 
The Company’s principal accounting policies 
are unchanged compared with the year ended 
31 March 2014.
For the reasons set out on page 33, the 
Company’s financial statements are prepared 
on a going concern basis.
As permitted by Section 408(2) of the 
Companies Act 2006, the Company’s profit 
and loss account and statement of total 
recognised gains and losses are not presented 
in these financial statements. Profit and loss 
account disclosures are presented in Note 14.
Tangible fixed assets
Tangible fixed assets are stated at historical 
purchase cost less accumulated depreciation. 
Cost includes the original purchase price of 
the asset and the costs attributable to bringing 
the asset to its working condition for its 
intended use. Depreciation is provided on  
a straight-line basis to write off the cost of 
tangible fixed assets over their estimated 
useful life. Tangible fixed assets comprise 
furniture, fixtures, fittings and computer 
software which are depreciated over a period 
of five to ten years. Impairment reviews are 
undertaken if there are indications that the 
carrying values may not be recoverable.
Investments
An undertaking is regarded as a subsidiary 
undertaking if the Company has control over  
its operating and financial policies.
An undertaking is regarded as an associate if 
the Company holds a participating interest and 
has significant influence, but not control, over  
its operating and financial policies. Significant 
influence generally exists where the Company 
holds more than 20% and less than 50% of 
the shareholders’ voting rights.
Investments in subsidiary undertakings and in 
associates represent interests that are directly 
owned by the Company and are stated at cost 
less amounts written-off for any permanent 
diminution in value.
Amounts owed by or to subsidiary 
undertakings
Amounts owed by or to subsidiary 
undertakings are stated at amortised cost 
using the effective interest method. Amounts 
owed by subsidiary undertakings are written 
off where deemed unrecoverable. 
Research and development
All expenditure on research and development  
is charged to the profit and loss account  
when incurred.
Leases
Operating lease payments are charged to the 
profit and loss account on a straight-line basis 
over the lease term.
Retirement benefits
The Company participates in a defined benefit 
pension scheme in which certain of its 
subsidiaries also participate. The Company, 
which is not the principal employer, cannot 
identify its share of the underlying assets and 
liabilities of the scheme. Accordingly, as 
permitted by FRS 17 Retirement Benefits ,  
the Company accounts for the scheme as  
a defined contribution scheme and charges  
its contributions to the scheme to the profit  
and loss account in the periods in which  
they fall due.
Deferred tax
Deferred tax is recognised on a discounted full 
provision basis on timing differences between 
the recognition of gains and losses in the 
financial statements and their recognition for  
tax purposes that have arisen but not reversed 
at the balance sheet date. Deferred tax is not 
recognised on permanent differences or on 
timing differences arising on unremitted profits 
of overseas subsidiaries. Deferred tax assets 
are recognised only to the extent that it is 
considered more likely than not that there will 
be sufficient future taxable profits to permit tax 
relief of the underlying timing differences.
Foreign currency translation
Transactions denominated in foreign  
currencies are translated into pounds sterling  
at the exchange rate ruling on the date of the 
transaction. Monetary assets and liabilities 
denominated in foreign currencies are 
retranslated into pounds sterling at the 
exchange rate ruling on the balance sheet date. 
Currency translation differences are credited or 
charged to the profit and loss account.
Non-monetary assets denominated in  
foreign currencies are not usually retranslated. 
An investment in an overseas subsidiary 
undertaking or associate is, however, 
retranslated if it is financed by foreign currency 
borrowings and the borrowings are designated 
as a hedging instrument in relation to the 
investment. If this is the case, the resulting 
translation gain or loss on the investment is 
recognised in the profit and loss account 
where, to the extent that the hedge is effective, 
it will be offset by the translation gain or loss 
on the related borrowings.
Share-based incentives
As described in Note 25 to the Group financial 
statements, the Company operates share-
based incentive plans under which it grants 
awards over its ordinary shares to its own 
employees and to those of its subsidiary 
undertakings. All of the awards granted  
under the existing plans are classified  
as equity-settled awards.
For awards granted to its own employees,  
the Company recognises an expense that is 
based on the fair value of the awards measured 
at the grant date using the Black-Scholes 
option pricing formula. Fair value reflects any 
market performance conditions and all 
non-vesting conditions. Adjustments are  
made to the compensation expense to reflect 
actual and expected forfeitures due to failure  
to satisfy service conditions or non-market 
performance conditions.
Generally, the expense is recognised in the 
profit and loss account on a straight-line basis 
over the vesting period and a corresponding 
credit is recognised in the profit and loss 
account reserve. 
For awards granted to employees of  
its subsidiary undertakings, the Company 
recognises a capital contribution to the 
subsidiary and a corresponding credit  
to equity calculated on the same basis as  
the expense that it recognises for awards  
to its own employees. 
Provisions
Provisions are recognised when the Company 
has a present obligation as a result of a past 
event, it is probable that a transfer of 
economic benefits will be required to settle  
the obligation, and a reliable estimate can be 
made of the amount of the obligation.
Guarantees
From time to time, the Company provides 
guarantees to third parties in respect of the 
indebtedness of its subsidiary undertakings 
and joint ventures. The Directors consider 
these guarantees to be insurance 
arrangements and, therefore, the Company 
recognises a liability in respect of such 
guarantees only in the event that it becomes 
probable that the guarantee will be called 
upon and the Company will be required to 
make a payment to the third party.
Own shares
Own shares represent the Company’s ordinary 
shares that are held by the Company in 
treasury or by a sponsored Employee Benefit 
Trust that are used to satisfy awards made 
under the Company’s share-based incentive 
plans. When own shares are acquired, the 
cost of purchase in the market is deducted 
from the profit and loss account reserve. 
Gains or losses on the subsequent transfer  
or sale of own shares are also recognised  
in the profit and loss account reserve.
Dividends 
Dividends on the Company’s ordinary 
shares are recognised when they have been 
appropriately authorised and are no longer 
at the Company’s discretion. Accordingly, 
interim dividends are recognised when they 
are paid and final dividends are recognised 
when they are declared following approval 
by shareholders at the Company’s AGM. 
Dividends are recognised as an appropriation 
of shareholders’ funds. Details of dividends 
paid and proposed are set out in Note 12.

documents in this way. This approach enables the Company to reduce printing and distribution 
costs and its impact on the environment. 
Shareholders who have not elected to receive paper copies are sent a notification whenever 
shareholder documents are published, to advise them how to access the documents via the  
Tate & Lyle website, www.tateandlyle.com. Shareholders may also choose to receive this 
notification via email with a link to the relevant page on the website. Shareholders who wish  
to receive email notification should register online at www.shareview.co.uk, using their  
shareholder reference number that is either on their share certificate or other correspondence.
Beware of share fraud
Shareholders should be very wary of any unsolicited calls or correspondence offering to buy  
or sell shares at a discounted price. These calls are typically from fraudsters operating ‘boiler 
rooms’. Boiler rooms use increasingly sophisticated means to approach investors and often leave 
their victims out of pocket. If you are concerned that you may have been targeted by fraudsters 
please contact the FCA Consumer Helpline on 0800 111 6768.

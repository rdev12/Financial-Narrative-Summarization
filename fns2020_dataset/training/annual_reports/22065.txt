Caledonia is one of the UK’s largest 
investment trusts and is self-managed.  
We aim to be a core investment for  
those seeking a store of increasing  
value, by investing for the longer term  
in a range of assets and providing an 
increasing dividend.
Our ability to identify opportunities 
through our extensive network, invest  
in significant stakes for the longer  
term and involve ourselves with the 
managements of investee companies 
underpins our investment approach.

NAV per share growth over the year –  
1.0% outperformance against FTSE All-Share
 6 .4 % 2 Caledonia Investments plc Annual report 2011 Overview
Results
Against a background of market volatility over  
the past year, Caledonia’s net asset value per share 
increased by 6.4% compared with the FTSE All-
Share increase of 5.4%, an outperformance of 1.0%.
Over the longer term, Caledonia’s net asset value per 
share has significantly outperformed this index 
both over the last five years and since Caledonia 
became an investment trust in April 2003.
However, on a total return basis including dividends, 
our net asset value per share has underperformed 
over the last five years. This underperformance  
has been more marked in the case of our share  
price total return over the last five years, with a 
significant widening of the share price discount  
to net asset value, although we have strongly 
outperformed over ten years.
While we cannot directly control the share price 
and discount, sustained superior long term net asset 
value growth and a progressive dividend will be key 
influencing factors. In providing further details of 
Caledonia’s performance in his report, Will Wyatt 
gives strong emphasis to those objectives.
Dividend
The board has recommended a 5.3% increase in  
the final dividend to 26.0p per share, which will be 
payable on 11 August 2011. The total dividend for 
the year will therefore amount to 37.1p per share,  
an increase of 5.1% over the previous year. This 
represents the 44th successive year of annual 
dividend increases. It is the board’s intention to 
raise the dividend to a higher base level in due 
course, when income from the portfolio allows,  
and to continue its progressive dividend policy.
Investment strategy
The Chief Executive’s half-year and full-year  
reports set out in some detail the recommendations 
he and his management team have made to the 
board for building on Caledonia’s past success  
and achieving strong performance in the future.  
The board has agreed both the overall strategy  
and the strategy proposed for the component  
parts of the investment portfolio.
The Caledonia investment philosophy is tried and 
tested and will continue to be followed. However, 
within that model the board fully endorses, for 
instance, the moves towards managing Caledonia’s 
investments as pools of capital with enhanced 
accountability for relevant members of the 
investment team and towards the inclusion of  
a pool to yield higher income as well as growth.  
In furtherance of these moves, the management 
team has been strengthened in recent months  
by the recruitment of two senior executives.
Board
The board has seen a number of changes since  
the sad death of Peter Buckley in December  
2008, when I took over as Chairman. A year later,  
Stephen King joined the board as Finance Director, 
in succession to Jonathan Cartwright, and last  
July Will Wyatt succeeded Tim Ingram as Chief 
Executive. Charles Gregson joined the board as  
an additional independent non-executive director  
in September 2009.
Over the last two and a half years, Caledonia has 
therefore seen changes in the Chairman, Chief 
Executive and Finance Director. In view of this,  
the board sees the need for some continuity and 
stability, but is also conscious of the length of  
tenure of certain non-executive directors and  
thus intends to undertake a process of gradual 
board refreshment.
In the meantime, David Thompson will take over 
from Charles Allen-Jones, the Senior Independent 
Director, as Chairman of the Audit Committee. 
Charles has served as a non-executive director for 
over nine years and Mark Davies will soon have 
done so. However, each of them contributes a  
wealth of knowledge and experience to the board’s 
deliberations in a manner which, in the board’s  
view, enables them to continue to be regarded  
as independent, notwithstanding this milestone.

Staff
I would like to thank the members of our management 
team for the expertise and diligence they have 
brought to bear on Caledonia’s affairs, and all of  
our staff for the dedicated and professional way  
in which they have worked throughout the year.
Outlook
In most of the developed world low economic 
growth seems likely to persist for some time to 
come, including in the UK. The main drivers of  
the world economy will continue to be elsewhere, 
notably China and India, though policy moves to 
control inflation in those countries may well be  
a limiting factor. Whilst the outlook for Western 
stock markets is bound to be affected by sluggish 
domestic growth, it will also be influenced by the 
major exposure of companies based in developed 
countries to higher growth economies.
With the strategies described above in place and 
ably led by the Chief Executive and his strengthened 
management team, Caledonia will be in a good 
position to take advantage of the investment 
opportunities ahead, as well as benefitting from  
the strengths in its existing portfolio.
James Loudon 
Chairman
AIFM Directive
I mentioned in my report last year that Caledonia 
was making concerted efforts to persuade EU  
policy makers to exclude investment trusts from  
the scope of the Alternative Investment Fund 
Managers Directive. The principal purpose of the 
Directive was to impose greater transparency  
and accountability on private equity and hedge 
funds following the financial crisis. However, it 
encompassed investment trusts within its definition 
of an alternative investment fund, but without any 
recognition of the differences in their nature and 
characteristics. The Directive was approved by  
the European Parliament in November 2010 and, 
while regrettably the adopted version did not 
exclude investment trusts, it did incorporate 
significant amendments to the original text drafted 
by the European Commission. These should enable 
self-managed investment trusts to continue in their 
current form without substantial changes to their 
governance structures, though there will inevitably 
be some additional cost.
However, the European Commission is now to  
draft implementation measures which will then 
have to be incorporated by Member States into 
national law, probably in 2013. As always, the devil 
will be in the detail. We shall therefore continue  
to monitor closely and, where necessary, try to 
influence the progress of the Directive through its 
remaining stages in order to seek the best possible 
outcome for Caledonia and other self-managed 
investment trusts.

Overview
Main themes from the review
Caledonia’s aims are:
● ● to provide an increasing store of wealth for 
shareholders
● ● to provide an increasing annual income for 
shareholders.
Caledonia’s core investment philosophy is:
● ● to invest in listed and unlisted companies  
and funds
● ● to invest in the UK and overseas
● ● to back high quality management teams
● ● to take significant minority positions with board 
representation if possible
● ● to take a long term supportive approach
● ● to invest in a value orientated style
● ● to maintain a concentrated portfolio.
We will also maintain an income portfolio,  
as described below.
Caledonia will avoid:
● ● start up or very early stage companies
● ● highly leveraged companies
● ● companies whose business we do not understand.
We will continue to measure ourselves against the 
FTSE All-Share capital and total return indices.
Key areas that required attention
● ● The way in which our management resource was 
deployed, whilst seeking to keep our total expense 
ratio to about 1%.
● ● The number of investments in our portfolio (68) 
was too large and too many were sub-scale so 
unlikely to make a significant impact. In the 
future, we will aim to keep the minimum size  
of new investments above £10m.
● ● Caledonia’s portfolio yield of 1.9% and dividend 
yield of about 2% were too low compared with  
the FTSE All-Share at 3%. Our portfolio yield 
therefore needs to increase.
● ● Our investment and divestment process  
needed refining.
Performance summary
Caledonia’s net asset value (‘NAV’) per share grew 
from 2034p to 2165p over the year to 31 March 
2011. This represented an increase of 6.4% and  
a welcome return to outperformance against the 
FTSE All-Share index, albeit by a modest 1.0%.  
Our five year record also remains positive with  
an outperformance of 5.3%. However, we should  
not ignore the deterioration in our total return 
performance in the medium term, both on an NAV 
per share total return (‘NAV TR’) and share price 
total return (‘TSR’) basis. Our NAV TR has 
underperformed the FTSE All-Share Total Return 
index by 5.0% over the past five years and our TSR 
has underperformed by 24.4% over this same 
period reflecting, to a large extent, the significant 
widening of the discount from a small premium in 
2006 to its year end of 20.3%. Over the longer term, 
on all measures, we have delivered strong 
outperformance, but in particular our TSR exceeded 
our benchmark by 113.5% over a ten year period.
Review of strategy
As I mentioned in the half-year report, I took the 
opportunity on my appointment as Chief Executive 
to conduct a review of our strategy. My review 
confirmed that much at Caledonia is fit for purpose, 
but also that we need to address certain issues  
and this work is underway. The review concluded 
that we had too many investments which were  
too small, we were not using our management 
resource efficiently and that we could enhance our 
investment process. I have recommended to the 
board a series of proposals specifically aimed at 
improving, over time, our overall returns, including 
the introduction of a specific allocation to income 
producing assets. The structure of this year’s annual 
report reflects these strategic initiatives and they 
are described in more detail below. In summary, 
they involve the re-orientation of our portfolio into 
pools of capital, each reflecting an investment theme 
with clearer management responsibilities and 
objectives. We have strengthened our management 
team to introduce specific skills to manage these 
pools of capital and have refreshed our investment 
and divestment criteria, which will in due course 
result in a core portfolio of 40 to 50 investments.
Chief Executive’s report Caledonia Investments plc Annual report 2011 5
Overview Business review Governance Financial statements Other information
To address these issues, we implemented the 
following changes:
Pools of capital
The investment portfolio has been reorganised  
into six distinct pools of capital, details of which  
are described on pages 11 to 16. These pools,  
which will form the basis of our reporting from  
now on, are:
Pool Investment manager
Current
Portfolio
Possible 
allocation
in 3-5 years
Quoted Mat Masters 34% 20-30%
Unquoted Duncan Johnson 22% 20-30%
Asia John May 13% 15-20%
Property Charles Cayzer 8% 5-10%
Funds Jamie Cayzer-Colvin 16% 10-15%
Income and 
Growth Stephen Mitchell 1% 15-20%
Cash/(debt) 6% 10-(10)%
Each pool is headed by an investment executive  
who has clear objectives and an agreed strategy. 
However, most of our existing investments continue 
to be managed by the executive responsible for its 
origination. The transition to the new pool format 
will take some time to complete. We will NOT 
manage the portfolio by strict allocation to each 
pool, though the board will review on a regular 
basis the absolute amounts with regard to upper 
limits. The probable shape of the portfolio in the 
future is shown above though, of course, events  
will continue to play a large part in our decisions. 
Geography
Caledonia’s style of investment, in taking significant 
minority positions often allied to a board seat, 
works effectively in the UK and, to a certain extent, 
Europe, but is more difficult to execute further  
afield due to differences in culture, distance and 
communication. We will however continue to invest 
directly in India. Caledonia will tend to use indirect 
means, such as funds or holding companies, to 
invest in other regions.
Dividend and the income portfolio
Caledonia is one of only a handful of companies in 
the UK that has increased its dividend every year  
for more than four decades. Over time, our strong 
capital growth has meant that our current dividend 
yield at around 2% is now too low and lags the 
market significantly. We have decided therefore to 
invest in a portfolio of large capitalisation global 
companies that offer a significant yield whilst 
retaining good medium term growth prospects.  
We believe that income will be an increasing part of 
overall return in what is likely, in the medium term, 
to be a challenging investment environment. Despite 
the considerable level of distributable reserves on 
our balance sheet, we would not consider it prudent 
to pay an uncovered dividend. Whilst it remains  
the board’s intention to raise the dividend to a 
higher base level and to continue its progressive 
nature, we will only do so when income from the  
portfolio allows.
I am confident that these initiatives will form a 
sound basis for Caledonia to improve its returns  
in the future.

Investment activity
In the year to 31 March 2011, we invested  
£106.7m and realised £180.1m. We made five new 
investments (excluding Income and Growth pool 
investments), seven follow-on investments and 
seven full disposals during the year. On the pool 
basis by which we now categorise and manage our 
portfolio, Quoted, Unquoted and Fund investments 
have been the main drivers of our performance  
over the past year, with Property producing a 
disappointing fall in value.

In a concentrated and long term portfolio such as 
ours, the main drivers of performance are the larger 
investments. To highlight the concentrated nature  
of the portfolio, we hold two investments that 
exceed £100m in value, three between £50m and 
£100m and 14 that are worth between £20m and 
£50m, together comprising 75.7% of the portfolio.  
As might be expected, most of the larger ones have 
been held for some time, though of the 19 mentioned 
above, 12 were investments made in the past eight  
years, including four within the past five years, the 
investments being sourced and made by the existing 
management team. On an individual investment 
basis, the table below highlights the principal

There are further details on the portfolio and each

pages 8 to 16.
Discount
Our discount has ranged between 13% and 23% 
during the course of the year. With the Cayzer  
family concert party owning just over 46% of our 
issued share capital, we only have limited capacity 
to undertake share buy-backs. We acknowledge  
that buy-backs are immediately NAV per share 
enhancing and will use them when there is 
exceptional value on offer for shareholders, though 
we question their longer term effect as a discount 
control mechanism. We believe that it is 
performance of the portfolio that attracts new 
investors to our register. This creates demand  
for our shares which will reduce the discount  
and I am confident that the strategic initiatives 
discussed in detail in this report will help to 
enhance our performance record.
Outlook
Caledonia retains a strong, ungeared balance sheet 
with over £100m of cash. We will continue the 
process of rebalancing the portfolio, exiting the 
smaller investments and looking in particular for 
new opportunities for the Unquoted and Asia pools. 
There is still value to be found in certain equity 
markets and we would anticipate adding 
significantly to the Income and Growth pool 
throughout the year. In the UK, the FTSE 250 looks 
expensive by historical standards, but, should there 
be a major correction in markets, we might use our 
facilities to build stakes in a number of UK quoted 
businesses that we follow closely. We have put 
significant effort into stimulating deal flow, which 
should lead to a good list of opportunities, though 
we note the very high prices currently being paid  
in unquoted markets by those needing to get funds 
deployed. This has never been our way and we will 
seek value in sound, well managed companies. We 
will continue to look for new opportunities in Asia, 
with the aim of increasing further our exposure to 
this fast growing region.
We are confident that our shareholders will benefit 
in the long run, despite a difficult economic climate.  
I would like to thank our staff for their contribution 
over the past year and welcome to our team the new 
joiners whose impact is already being felt.

Chief Executive Caledonia Investments plc Annual report 2011 7
Investment model
Attract preferential deal flow
Our reputation, network of deal originators and 
family tradition enables us to access premium 
investment opportunities not always available  
to others. This derives from both tracking quality 
management teams in proven businesses and 
through the contacts we make through our 
extensive board representation network. 
Identify best opportunities
We seek businesses with established business 
models, strong cash flows and proven management 
teams. Such opportunities are not reliant on 
leverage for returns and offer long term  
growth potential. 
Invest in significant stakes
We invest directly in both quoted and unquoted 
opportunities across the world where the 
opportunity exists to invest a meaningful 
proportion of the equity base for an investment  
size of between £20m and £50m. We expect to  
take stakes of 10% or more.
Manage and support investees
We manage our investments as pools of capital, 
focussing ownership and responsibility to our 
executive team. Through a board seat, we can both 
actively monitor the development of our investment 
and provide long term support and governance.
Develop business network
Maintaining our reputation as a supportive and 
constructively involved long term investor enables 
us to develop our network of contacts who will give 
us priority consideration when new deal 
opportunities arise. 
The Caledonia team
At its heart, our investment process is focussed on 
recruiting and retaining high quality investment 
executives to maintain deal flow and investment 
continuity, who understand and are able to execute 
Caledonia’s investment philosophy.
Our investment model has been successfully 
developed and deployed over many years to 
demonstrate both a growing long term store  
of wealth and income. 
It is based on maintaining and developing  
our extensive network, carefully filtering the 
investment opportunities that arise from our 
contacts and an active monitoring of investment 
performance and value.

After the collapse of markets in 2008 and early 
2009, conditions have generally improved over  
the year. Real global GDP growth in 2010 was  
driven by high growth in India, China and other 
significant developing economies, together with 
recovery in some industrialised countries, including 
Germany, Japan and the US. This offset the sluggish 
performance of the UK, France and smaller 
European countries.
Equity markets ended the year at moderately higher 
levels than at the start. For example, the FTSE 
All-Share index started the year at 2910 and ended 
at 3068. However, there was a considerable amount 
of volatility during the year and the FTSE All-Share 
had a high and low of 3158 and 2486 respectively.
Portfolio movements
At the beginning of the year, the value of our 
investment portfolio was £1,184.6m. This reduced 
marginally to £1,183.2m (including derivatives)  
at the year end after substantial net realisations,  
the proceeds of which were largely held in cash  
of £101.2m. The following chart illustrates the 
components of this movement:

During the year, we began a process of realigning 
our portfolio across the new pools of capital.  
This has necessitated a period of higher than usual 
liquidity as we make the transition. In the process, 
we have reduced our investments in funds and  
sold our holding in Rathbone Brothers. Most of  
the proceeds from these realisations were retained  
in cash at the year end, pending redeployment, 
principally through the Income and Growth pool.

Geography 
The following chart shows the distribution of net 
assets between geographical regions. The basis of 
this analysis is the country of listing, country of 
residence for unlisted investments and underlying 
regional analysis for funds.

Cash and other 6% –
At the year end, UK investments accounted for 58% 
of net assets, principally held in listed companies, a 
reduction from 64% at the last year end, reflecting 
the realisation of a number of UK investments to 
provide liquidity to invest in global equities through 
the Income and Growth pool.
Asset class
The following chart shows the distribution of net 
assets by asset class. Listed securities represented 
57% of net assets at the year end and unlisted 
investments (companies and funds) in total 
accounted for 37%.

Currency
The following chart analyses net assets by currency 
exposure, based on the currency in which securities 
are denominated or traded, net of any currency 
hedges.
Currency distribution
  
       2011 2010
Pound sterling 79% 77%
US dollar 11% 8%
Indian rupee 7% 7%
Euro 2%    7%
Other currencies 1% 1%
Pound sterling represented 79% of the exposure at 
the year end, a rise from 77% at the end of last year. 
This differs from the geographic distribution and 
shows a rise rather than a fall reflecting both the 
inclusion of uninvested cash and a £75.1m forward 
contract taken out during the year to provide a 
currency hedge against the euro denominated 
investment in Cobepa. In addition, the currency 
distribution differs from the geographical 
distribution as a number of investments in Asia are 
denominated in US dollars and pound sterling.

Quoted investments pool
The Quoted pool contains significant investments  
in UK and foreign quoted companies in which 
Caledonia holds a greater than 3% stake, excluding 
quoted companies principally operating in the Asian 
region, property sector, investment companies  
or large cap companies contained in the Income  
and Growth pool. These are generally UK 
headquartered companies with whom we can 
establish and develop good long term relationships.
The pool started the year with a portfolio valued  
at £444.2m and ended the year with a value of 
£427.0m, principally resulting from net realisations 
of £35.7m and revaluation gains of £18.5m.
The principal activity in the pool was the sale  
of our holding in Rathbone Brothers, a wealth 
management business, for £29.9m. We received 
repayment of our £11.2m loan to Avanti 
Communications, a satellite business, and reinvested 
£5.0m of these proceeds in a share placing to help 
Avanti finance the expansion of its satellite fleet.  
We also added to our holding in Avanti with market 
purchases of £3.7m towards the end of the year.
The portfolio provided a positive return of 7.1% 
over the year, which comprised an increase in 
valuation of £18.5m and income of £11.5m.  
Close Brothers, a banking, asset management and 
securities group, increased in value by £13.8m 
(9.1%), which is in line with the continued good 
performance of its banking business, and paid  
£7.7m of dividends to us. Bristow Group, the US 
quoted helicopter services group, increased in value 
by £11.2m (18.4%), with both improved earnings 
and market rating being tempered by a weakening 
of the pound against the dollar. A.G.Barr, the soft 
drinks manufacturer, increased in value by £9.7m 
(30.0%), with both its earnings improving and the 
market rewarding its consistent performance with  
a higher rating over the year. A.G.Barr paid us  
£0.8m of dividends during the year. Serica Energy, 
the oil and gas exploration and production company, 
declined in value by £13.5m (61.8%), as the business 
failed to find significant commercial oil or gas 
reserves from an extensive drilling campaign 
during the year.
We continue to look for interesting and robust 
businesses run by good management teams in which 
to invest over the longer term, with an appropriate 
degree of caution given both uncertain economic 
times and the high valuations in the smaller  
cap markets.

Unquoted investments pool
The Unquoted pool contains investments in UK and 
foreign unquoted companies, excluding unquoted 
companies principally operating in Asia or the 
property sector.
The Unquoted pool had a good year, increasing  
in value by 19.6%, compared with a 8.7% increase  
in the FTSE All-Share Total Return index. This 
performance was driven principally by increases  
in earnings, as the recovery seen earlier in the 
larger quoted markets fed through to these 
companies. The Unquoted pool was valued at 
£264.1m at the start of the year and £281.2m  
at the end, after net realisations of £24.0m.
We received £14.1m from Penta Geronimo on the 
sale of Geronimo Inns to Youngs, a 27.7% IRR on our 
investment. Geronimo Inns was started 15 years 
ago and Caledonia co-invested with Penta Capital  
in 2006 to provide growth capital to the business.
The specialist industrial cleaning products division 
of Amber Group, a wholly-owned subsidiary, was 
sold to Berner Group, a private Germany based 
international logistics company, for which  
Caledonia received a net £9.6m in sale proceeds  
and capital dividends.
The Unquoted portfolio increased in value over  
the year by £41.1m. The principal contributors  
were Cobepa, the Belgium private investment 
company, Sterling Industries, the UK based, wholly-
owned, industrial engineering business, Satellite 
Information Services, the UK broadcasting  
services business, Celerant Consulting, the UK based 
management consultancy business, Amber Group, 
the UK based, wholly-owned, specialty chemicals 
business, and Penta Geronimo, the UK pubs group. 
These increases were partially offset by a decline  
in the value of, and investment provision against, 
Ermitage, the majority-owned, Jersey based funds  
of hedge funds manager.

Asia investments pool
The Asia pool contains investments based in, or 
selected through their focus on trading or investing 
in, the Asia region. These investments are typically 
locally listed or unlisted companies and funds 
investing in the Asia region. 
Caledonia has been assessing investment 
opportunities in Asia since 2004, attracted by  
the underlying demographic profiles, high growth 
rates and prospects of economies in the region.  
At 31 March 2011, the value of our Asia pool was 
£159.0m, invested principally in India, China  
and Vietnam. 
Generally, the Indian and Chinese economies have 
been well managed – they did not suffer the same 
degree of collapse as the Western developed 
economies in 2008 and 2009 and are less heavily 
indebted. Progress is constrained in India by 
inadequate infrastructure and the inflation rate is 
uncomfortably high, but the country enjoys the 
benefits of democracy, rule of law and a widespread 
use of the English language. China seems to power 
ahead whilst facing different challenges arising from 
its centrally planned economy and political system. 
Longer term prospects for both look attractive 
compared with Europe and many other parts of the 
world. Vietnam’s economy continued to suffer into 
2011, with significant current account deficits, 
inflation and devaluations all contributing to a loss of 
both international and domestic investor confidence.
Three new investments were made in Asia during 
the year. We invested £20.6m to acquire a 13.9% 
holding in Deutsche Postbank Home Finance,  
the fourth largest private sector housing finance 
provider in India. This was to support the expansion 
of Dewan Housing Finance, in which we hold a stake 
of 9.6%, and which is the third largest private  
sector housing finance provider in India. Dewan 
Housing Finance and its promoter group bought the 
rest of DP Home Finance. We have a board seat and it 
is likely that the businesses will merge in due course. 
We provided £9.8m of seed finance to establish a 
track record for Gateway to India, a fund managed 
through Mauritius by India Investment Partners  
(in which we held a 40% stake), which we expect in 
due course to be converted into an open-ended fund 
available to outside investors. It invests principally 
in Indian listed large and mid-cap equities. We also 
committed $20m to the second growth capital fund 
established by the Capital Today team, which has 
been making very encouraging progress in its 
strategy of investing in consumer facing private 
companies in China. We reduced our stake in  
Alok Industries, a major Indian integrated textiles 
producer, from 12.3% to 11.8%. Our exposure  
to Vietnam continues, but we sold two of our 
Vietnamese investments, reducing our portfolio 
exposure to £6.9m.
The principal contributors to the increase in value 
of the Asia pool was £7.3m from Dewan Housing 
Finance and £6.8m from our cornerstone 
investments in the Capital Today China growth 
funds, where the valuation of our stake in its first 
fund rose strongly, principally through the success 
of its investment in Jing Dong, a leading online 
retailer of IT and digital products.

The Property pool contains investments holding  
or trading in property, typically UK listed and 
unlisted property companies and funds investing in 
property assets.
Our Property pool has had a disappointing year, 
falling in value by £8.4m. The underperformance 
has principally arisen from a £7.1m decline in the 
value of our investment in Quintain Estates, the  
UK listed property investment, management and 
development company, with major projects at 
Wembley and the Greenwich Peninsular, as a result 
of both a slow pace of development and its continued 
debt burden.
In October 2010, London & Stamford underwent 
significant structural change. The management 
company was bought in for new shares which, 
although NAV dilutive, will show benefits to both 
revenues and expenses. This, combined with 
becoming a more tax efficient real estate investment 
trust, should help improve profitability. Although 
not yet fully invested, London & Stamford is  
paying a steadily increasing dividend. 
During the year, we invested a further £6.9m in 
Edinmore Investments, a wholly-owned subsidiary, 
to purchase commercial properties in the north of 
England with a high yield and good growth prospects.

The Funds pool contains investments in collective 
investment vehicles, other than in Asia, including 
listed and unlisted investment companies, private 
equity and hedge funds. Our objective in using fund 
structures is to access exceptional managers and to 
seek exposure to geographies where we may have 
limited experience, such as North America.
During the year, we realised £32.5m from the sale  
of part of our holding in British Empire Securities, 
the UK listed investment trust, taking advantage  
of the opportunity to reduce our holding in a strong 
market and at an attractively narrow discount to  
net asset value. This company has been a strong  
long term performer in our portfolio and remains  
a core investment. We realised £29.2m on the 
redemption of most of our investment in the 
Eddington Capital fund of hedge funds, which  
was closed due to the lack of critical mass in assets 
under management. We realised £13.6m on the 
redemption of two Polar Capital funds, as they  
came out of their seed periods.
We invested $13.0m (£8.5m) of a $20.0m 
commitment in Perlus Microcap, a fund managed  
by Perlus Investment Management and investing  
in global (principally US) publicly-traded  
micro-cap companies.
During 2010, Greenhill Capital Partners raised their 
third fund and we committed $20m at its first close. 
Since 2000, we have invested $27m in their first two 
funds, which so far have provided a net IRR of 35% 
and a net return on investment of some 2.0x.
The Funds pool performance of 10.2% derived 
mainly from a £13.8m increase in the value of  
British Empire Securities.

Business review 16 Caledonia Investments plc Annual report 2011 Business review
The Income and Growth pool contains investments 
focussing on yield and capital appreciation from 
worldwide markets. These investments are typically 
large cap listed equities, represent smaller stakes 
than our significant minority investments and are 
therefore more liquid. Such investments are 
typically multinational in nature and will therefore 
also provide us with an increased look-through 
exposure to world markets. The Income and Growth 
pool will expect to comprise 35 to 45 investments.
The Income and Growth pool has been created with 
three purposes in mind. First, to create a globally 
diversified, but focussed, portfolio of dividend 
paying companies. Second, to achieve an income 
from the portfolio that is significant enough to make 
a positive contribution to the overall dividend 
income that Caledonia receives and to contribute 
towards its own distributions. The third aim is to 
achieve growth, both in the operating businesses 
invested in, and also the stream of dividends 
received, the latter of which correlates very highly 
with good investment returns. Companies with high 
returns on equity, that grow book value per share, 
are those that are likely to pass the screening 
process and be eligible for more fundamental 
assessment of the business prospects and the 
management team. Good corporate governance  
is very important to Caledonia – particularly for 
investments outside the UK.
The overall target gross yield of the pool is 4.5%, 
which is at the upper end of most global income  
and growth funds’ achieved results. 
Stock selection will be firmly value orientated  
and in line with Caledonia’s disciplined investment 
process, looking for entry at a fair or better  
price and selecting names with very prudent 
balance sheet leverage and strong free cash flow 
characteristics. In terms of geography, the UK,  
US, Canada, Australia, northern Europe and 
Scandinavia are all natural areas for a conservative 
global income and growth fund to be investing. 
Some diversification into Asia, Brazil and China  
is also achievable, but India lacks good higher 
yielding companies.
In terms of the timing of establishment of the pool, 
the opportunity to move out of cash into stock 
markets, which are trading at valuations around 
their long term averages, looks a sensible 
proposition and the desired yields are obtainable. 
The investment process will be a gradual one,  
with thorough stock selection and company visits 
covering the geography of the investments as  
a key part of the process. Selecting stocks for  
income inevitably means that, to realise that 
income, holding periods need to be reasonably  
long and the margin of safety to do that is  
embedded within the process. A gradual start  
has been made, first in the UK and European 
markets since late March 2011, and we look  
forward to reporting in more detail at the half-year 
the progress on constructing a globally diversified 
portfolio of above average – and growing – dividend  
yielding companies.

Company total return
The company generates returns through both 
revenue earnings, net of expenses, and capital 
growth. For the year ended 31 March 2011, the total 
return was £84.1m (2010 – £311.7m), comprising 
earnings equivalent to 145.1p (2010 – 539.6p) per 
share, of which 40.4p (2010 – 41.1p) was derived 
from revenue and 104.7p (2010 – 498.5p) from 
capital growth.
Company revenue performance
Revenue earned from the company’s investments 
increased by 0.6% to £33.2m (2010 – £33.0m)  
over the year. The income for the year included  
an £8.3m dividend from Amber Group, a £2.4m 
income distribution from Penta Geronimo on the 
repayment of loans from Geronimo Inns, and a 
£2.0m dividend from TGE Marine. Income in the 
previous year included a £3.2m dividend paid by 
Satellite Information Services not repeated in 2011, 
dividends from a number of investments realised 
during the year, with the proceeds held in low 
yielding cash pending reinvestment, together with  
a number of dividends accelerated into 2010 in 
advance of last year’s increase in the higher rate  
of income tax.
The yield on the company’s portfolio increased over 
the year to 2.81%, which compares with 2.79% for 
last year. By comparison, the yield on the FTSE 
All-Share fell over the year by 6.3%, from 3.16%  
to 2.96%.
Company capital performance
The recovery in the markets and improved 
underlying earnings led to a 6.4% increase in  
NAV per share over the year. Net gains on 
investments and derivatives totalled £71.7m  
(2010 – £295.3m) and a £10.0m investment 
provision was established in relation to a guarantee 
for a subsidiary’s bank loan. The principal gains 
were £13.8m from Close Brothers, £13.8m from 
British Empire Securities, £11.9m from Cobepa and 
£11.2m from Bristow Group. These were partially 
offset by a £13.5m loss in the value of Serica Energy.

investments
Unlisted investments (companies and funds) 
contributed £47.3m to the valuation increase.  
The company maintains a prudent valuation 
approach to these investments. Unlisted property 
and fund investments are usually based on external 
valuations and internal valuations of other 
investments conducted in accordance with  
the IPEV Guidelines.
Company expenses
The total expense ratio (‘TER’) for the year was 
0.81% (2010 – 1.14%), compared with an industry 
average of 1.40% (2010 – 1.40%). We calculate our 
TER on an industry standard basis, comprising 
published management expenses over the monthly 
average NAV, to aid comparability.
Overall, the company’s expenses allocated to the 
revenue reserve were 21.1% lower than last year  
at £9.7m (2010 – £12.3m). This was due mainly  
to a £1.5m reduction in the share-based payment 
expense in 2011 compared with 2010, principally 
arising on the lapsing of the 2008 share option and 
deferred bonus matching share awards, together 
with other savings in staff-related costs.
Dividend
The company’s policy is to maintain a progressive 
dividend. We recognise that a reliable source of 
growing dividends is an important part of 
shareholder return and are pleased to extend our 
record of growing annual dividends to 44 years.
We paid an interim dividend of 11.1p per share on  
6 January 2011 and have proposed a final dividend 
of 26.0p per share, up 5.3% on last year. The total 
dividend for the year of 37.1p is an increase of 5.1% 
on the 35.3p last year (paid as interim and second 
interim dividends).
If approved by shareholders, the final dividend will 
be payable on 11 August 2011 to holders of shares 
on the register on 8 July 2011. The ex-dividend date 
will be 6 July 2011.

Consolidated results
The consolidated results differ from the company 
results in incorporating the group’s share of  
the earnings and net assets of subsidiaries and joint 
ventures, as opposed to their investment returns 
and fair value. The consolidated diluted earnings 
per share were 118.7p (2010 – 517.0p).
Cash flows, liquidity and facilities
The company started the year with net cash of 
£8.3m and ended with £101.2m. During the year, 
liquidity has been increased in preparation for  
an orderly deployment into the new Income and 
Growth pool, in which investment commenced  
just before the year end and will continue over  
the course of the coming year.
The company has committed bank facilities of 
£100m in place at the year end and has strong 
covenant cover. It had no borrowings at 31 March 
2011 or 2010 and did not draw on its facilities 
during the year.

Prior to 2005, profits, earnings and net assets were prepared in accordance with UK GAAP , however, NAVs per share have been adjusted as appropriate to exclude accrued 
dividends. Net assets and NAVs per share for 2002 and 2003 were based on the company total return pro forma published in the annual report 2003, restating results  
as though the company had been an investment trust throughout the year. NAVs per share prior to 2006 reported on an undiluted basis have been restated on a diluted 
basis. Profits and earnings for 2002 have not been included as the company was not an investment trust during that year.
Subsidiaries had borrowings totalling £79.0m  
at 31 March 2011 (2010 – £86.2m) to finance 
operations. Caledonia provided guarantees and 
letters of comfort in respect of £70.0m (2010 – 
£76.7m) of these borrowings.
Treasury management
The Treasury department provides a central service 
to group companies and conducts its operations in 
accordance with clearly defined guidelines and 
policies, which have been reviewed and approved  
by the board. Treasury transactions are only 
undertaken as a consequence of underlying 
commercial transactions or exposures and do not 
seek to take active risk positions. It is Treasury’s 
role to ensure that the group has sufficient available 
funds to meet its needs in the foreseeable future.
During the year, the company took out a forward 
currency contract to sell €85.9m to hedge against 
the euro exposure of our investment in Cobepa.

Business review
Caledonia has a risk management framework  
that provides a structured process for identifying, 
assessing and managing risks associated with the 
company’s business objectives and strategy.  
The board has overall responsibility for setting the 
level of risk that the company is prepared to accept 
and this is regularly reviewed. The principal risks 
and mitigating actions are set out below. 20 Caledonia Investments plc Annual report 2011 Business review
Caledonia considers the impact of its business  
in the following areas:
Marketplace
As an investment company, we are committed to a 
long term investment strategy and to maintaining 
effective relationships with those companies in 
which we invest. We generally hold a board seat in 
our significant investments and use this to maintain 
a close relationship with managements of those 
companies. Additionally, we hold frequent meetings 
with managements and review internal documents, 
such as management accounts and reports.
We also make considered use of our voting rights. 
As a consequence of our involved investment style, 
we would expect to vote in line with management 
recommendations, but are prepared to abstain or 
vote against recommendations where we consider 
they are not in the interests of our shareholders.
We continue to meet with our institutional and 
individual shareholders and listen to any concerns 
they may have.
Workplace
Caledonia has in place a set of polices intended to 
protect employees from unlawful discrimination, 
offer them a working environment where they have 
a right to be treated fairly, with consideration and 
respect, and support high standards of conduct  
and performance. These policies assist in ensuring 
that the company meets applicable health and  
safety standards and treats disabled employees  
in accordance with its statutory obligations. These 
policies are communicated to employees by way  
of a staff handbook provided at the time of joining 
and periodically thereafter.
In addition to a grievance procedure, which  
allows employees to raise concerns either formally 
or informally, there are formal whistleblowing 
arrangements in place, which enable members  
of staff to raise any issue of concern regarding 
possible impropriety in the conduct of the 
company’s business, confidentially and 
independently of line management.
A formal performance appraisal process, through 
which employees may be set objectives on an annual 
basis and their achievement against those objectives 
assessed at the end of the year, is intended to  
ensure that employees have a clear view of their 
performance and the ability to develop their 
potential within the company through additional 
training where necessary. Together with team 
meetings and company-wide briefings, this provides 
staff with the opportunity to be closely involved in 
the success of the business.
Community
Caledonia encourages employees to support local 
voluntary organisations and charitable causes and 
provides matched sponsorship to their fundraising 
activities. This and other charitable donations made 
at the company’s own initiation in the year 
amounted to £60,800.
The company also supports the work of the Royal 
Horticultural Society and contributions to the  
RHS’s campaigns to promote gardening, through 
sponsorship of the RHS Chelsea Flower Show 
Charity Gala Preview, amounted to £103,200  
in the year.
Environment
Caledonia’s environmental impact is limited. 
However, any measures taken to reduce this  
impact demonstrate the company’s commitment  
to improve the environment and can have direct 
benefits through reductions in costs for energy  
and consumables. A number of measures have  
been and will be taken in this area:
● ● encouragement of the use of electronic 
communications to save paper, printing 
consumables and energy
● ● usage of video-conferencing and telephone 
conference calls rather than travelling to 
meetings
● ● recycling of office waste, used paper and  
other consumables.
Corporate responsibility Caledonia Investments plc Annual report 2011 21
Overview Business review Governance Financial statements Other information
Valuation methodology
Investments are measured at the directors’ estimate 
of fair value at the reporting date, in accordance 
with IAS 39 ‘Financial Instruments: Recognition and 
Measurement’. Fair value is the amount for which an 
asset could be exchanged between knowledgeable, 
willing parties in an arm’s length transaction.
Publicly traded securities
Investments listed in an active market are valued  
at their bid price on the reporting date. When a bid 
price is unavailable, the price of the most recent 
transaction will normally be used.
Unlisted companies
Unlisted company investments are valued by 
applying an appropriate valuation technique, which 
makes maximum use of market-based information, 
is consistent with models generally used by market 
participants and is applied consistently from period 
to period, except where a change would result in a 
better estimation of fair value.
The value of an unlisted company investment is 
generally crystallised through the sale or flotation 
of the entire business, rather than the sale of an 
individual instrument. Therefore, the estimation of 
fair value is based on the assumed realisation of the 
underlying business at the reporting date, based on 
the International Private Equity and Venture Capital 
Valuation Guidelines (September 2009). Recognition 
is given to the uncertainties inherent in estimating 
the fair value of unlisted companies and appropriate 
caution is applied in exercising judgments and 
making the necessary estimates.
Enterprise value is normally determined using one 
of the following valuation methodologies:
Price of recent investment
Where the investment being valued was recently 
acquired or a recent transaction has taken place,  
its cost or transaction price will generally provide  
a good indication of fair value. This methodology  
is likely to be appropriate only for a limited period 
after the date of the relevant transaction.
Multiples
This methodology involves the application of an 
earnings multiple to the maintainable earnings of 
the business and is likely to be appropriate for an 
investment in an established business with an 
identifiable stream of continuing earnings.
The earnings multiple used is determined by 
reference to market-based multiples appropriate  
for the business and correlating to the period and 
calculation of earnings of the company being valued. 
The aim is to identify comparator companies that 
are similar in terms of risk and growth prospects  
to the company being valued. Earnings multiples  
are adjusted for points of difference between the 
comparator and the company being valued where 
appropriate, including the ability of Caledonia to 
effect change in the company and risks associated 
with holding an unlisted share.
Maintainable earnings balance reliability  
and relevance. Generally, the latest historical 
accounts are used unless reliable forecast results  
for the current year are available. Earnings are 
adjusted where appropriate for exceptional or 
non-recurring items and an average of more  
than one year’s earnings may be used to better 
estimate maintainable earnings for cyclical or 
volatile businesses.
Net assets
The net assets methodology is likely to be appropriate 
for a business whose value derives mainly from the 
underlying value of its assets rather than its earnings, 
such as a property holding company and an 
investment business. It may also be appropriate for 
a business that is not making an adequate return on 
assets and for which a greater value can be realised 
by liquidating the business and selling its assets.  
A third party valuation may be used to give the  
fair value of a certain asset or group of assets.
Fund interests
Fund interests refer to participations in 
arrangements to create a designated pool of  
capital to invest in a wider range of assets than  
is feasible for an individual investor and to share  
the costs and benefits.
Open-ended funds, including investment companies 
with variable capital, typically report regular net 
asset values, which usually provide a reliable  
basis to estimate fair value. If the price reported  
by the fund is not available at the reporting date,  
the latest available price is used and may be 
adjusted to take account of changes or events  
to the reporting date.
Closed-ended funds include unlisted investment 
companies and limited partnerships. For these 
investments, the fair value estimate is based on  
a summation of the estimated fair value of the 
underlying investments. Fund manager valuation 
reports may be used where there is evidence that 
the valuation is derived using fair value principles 
and may be adjusted to take account of changes or 
events to the reporting date. Adjustment may also 
be necessary for features of the fund agreement  
not captured in the valuation report, such as 
performance fees or carried interest.
Other investments
Other investments include preference shares, loan 
notes or facilities, options, warrants and treasury 
instruments that are not publicly traded and do not 
form part of an investment in an unlisted company. 
For such investments, appropriate valuation 
techniques are adopted and used consistently.

Governance Governance 24 Caledonia Investments plc Annual report 2011
The directors present their report and accounts for the year ended  
31 March 2011. The directors’ remuneration report and the 
corporate governance report form part of this report.
Principal activities and results
Caledonia is an investment trust company. A review of the activities 
of the company, together with the results for the year, is given in the 
business review, which should be regarded as part of this report.  
In February 2011, the specialist industrial chemical products division 
of the Amber group was sold to Berner Group. There have been no 
other significant changes in the activities of its operating 
subsidiaries, principally comprising engineering, chemicals, 
property, support services, leisure, financial services and investment.
The company has been approved by Her Majesty’s Revenue and 
Customs (‘HMRC’) as an investment trust for its relevant financial 
years up to 31 March 2009 and continues to manage its affairs so  
as to comply with the requirements for investment trust status. 
Confirmation of investment trust status is granted retrospectively by 
HMRC for each financial year. An application for approval for the year 
ended 31 March 2010 has been made to HMRC and an application for 
approval for the year ended 31 March 2011 will be made subsequent 
to the approval of these accounts by shareholders of the company.
Dividends
An interim dividend of 11.1p per share (2010 – 10.6p) was paid on  
6 January 2011 and the board has proposed that a final dividend of 
26.0p per share (2010 – second interim dividend of 24.7p) be paid  
on 11 August 2011. This will result in total dividends for the year  
of 37.1p per share (2010 – 35.3p).
Annual general meeting
The eighty-second annual general meeting of the company will  
be held at Cayzer House, 30 Buckingham Gate, London SW1E 6NN

These shares ceased to be restricted on 1 April 2011. There have been 
no other changes in the directors’ interests shown above notified up 
to the date of approval of these accounts.
Details of the directors’ options to acquire ordinary shares in the 
company and awards over ordinary shares under the company’s 
deferred bonus plan as at 31 March 2011 are set out in the directors’ 
remuneration report on pages 31 to 38.
Directors’ indemnity
Each of the directors has the benefit, under the company’s articles  
of association, of an indemnity, to the extent permitted by the 
Companies Act 2006, against any liability incurred by him for 
negligence, default, breach of duty or breach of trust in relation  
to the affairs of the company.
Share capital structure
The company has two classes of share capital – ordinary shares  
of 5p each and deferred ordinary shares of 5p each.
The holders of the ordinary shares are entitled to receive dividends 
as declared from time to time and are entitled to one vote per share 
at meetings of the company. All voting rights are however suspended 
in respect of the company’s shares that are held in treasury or by 
group companies.
The deferred ordinary shares carry no voting rights and are not 
redeemable. They carry the right to a fixed cumulative preference 
dividend of 1% per annum (exclusive of any associated tax credit) of 
the nominal value of such deferred ordinary shares, being 0.05p per 
share, or £4,000 in aggregate, for all such shares currently in issue. 
The company is required to pay the dividend to the extent that it has 
distributable profits. On a winding-up or other return of capital, the 
deferred ordinary shares carry the right to the payment of the 
amount paid up on such shares only after holders of the ordinary 
shares have received the sum of £100,000 in respect of each such 
ordinary share. All of the deferred ordinary shares are held by 
Sterling Industries PLC, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Caledonia.
At 31 March 2011, 58,794,781 ordinary shares and 8,000,000 
deferred ordinary shares were in issue. The ordinary shares 
therefore represented approximately 88%, and the deferred ordinary 
shares approximately 12%, of the total issued share capital. Of the 
ordinary shares in issue at 31 March 2011, 572,230 shares were held 
in treasury and 3,000 shares held by a group company. As stated 
above, all voting rights are suspended on these shares.
Restrictions on the transfer of shares
There are no specific restrictions on the transfer of the company’s 
shares, although the articles of association contain provisions 
whereby the directors may refuse to register a transfer of a 
certificated share which is not fully paid, provided that such refusal 
does not prevent dealings in the share from taking place on an open 
and proper basis. The directors may also refuse to register the 
transfer of a certificated share unless it is (i) lodged, duly stamped,  
at the registered office or at such other place as the directors may 
appoint, accompanied by the certificate for the shares to which it 
relates and such other evidence as the directors may reasonably

require to show the right of the transferor to make the transfer;  
(ii) in respect of only one class of shares; and (iii) in favour of not 
more than four transferees.
The directors may refuse to register a transfer of shares if a 
shareholder has not supplied information to the company in default of  
a request duly served under section 793 of the Companies Act 2006 and 
such shares represent at least 0.25% of the class of shares concerned.

Employee share schemes
The Caledonia Investments plc Employee Share Trust acquires and 
holds ordinary shares in the company for subsequent transfer to 
employees exercising options under the company’s executive share 
option schemes or calling for awards vesting under the company’s 
deferred bonus plan. The voting rights of shares held by the trust are 
exercisable by the independent trustee. The trustee has also waived 
all dividends payable in respect of the ordinary shares held by the 
trust, except to the extent of 0.0001% of such dividends. At 31 March 
2011, the trust held 350,293 ordinary shares.
Restrictions on voting rights
The directors may direct that a shareholder shall not be entitled to 
attend and vote either personally or by proxy or exercise any other 
right conferred by membership in relation to general meetings of the 
company in respect of some or all of the shares held by him, if he or 
any person with an interest in such shares has been duly served with 
a notice under section 793 of the Companies Act 2006 and is in default 
for the prescribed period in supplying to the company the information 
required or, in purported compliance with such a notice, has made  
a statement which is false or inadequate in a material particular.
Agreements which may restrict the transfer of shares or exercise  
of voting rights
The company is not aware of any arrangements which may restrict 
the transfer of any of its shares or the exercise of any voting rights.
Appointment and removal of directors and the articles  
of association
The appointment and replacement of directors is governed by the 
company’s articles of association and prevailing company law. 
The articles of association provide that at every annual general 
meeting one-third of the directors, or if not a multiple of three, the 
number nearest to one-third, shall retire by rotation and therefore  
be required to seek re-election by shareholders. New directors may 
be appointed by the board, but are subject to election by shareholders  
at the next annual general meeting of the company following their 
appointment. However, to comply with the provisions of The UK 
Corporate Governance Code, which applies to the company from  
1 April 2011, the company now requires that all directors should be 
subject to annual election by shareholders. Shareholders may also 
appoint new directors by ordinary resolution. The articles of 
association limit the number of directors to not less than two and  
not more than twelve, unless the shareholders resolve otherwise.
A director may be removed from office if requested to resign by not 
less than three-quarters of the other directors or by an ordinary 
resolution of the shareholders.
Any amendment of the articles of association requires the approval  
of shareholders by a special resolution.
Authority to allot and purchase shares
At the annual general meeting of the company held on 21 July 2010, 
shareholders granted to the directors authority to allot ordinary 
shares up to a nominal amount of £970,375, representing 
approximately one-third of the ordinary share capital then in issue, 
excluding ordinary shares held in treasury, with authority to allot 
additional ordinary shares up to a nominal value of £970,376, 
representing approximately a further one-third of the issued 
ordinary share capital then in issue, excluding ordinary shares  
then held in treasury, by way of pre-emptive rights issues only,  
in accordance with guidance issued by the Association of British 
Insurers. The directors were further authorised to issue ordinary 
shares up to a nominal amount of £145,556 other than pro rata  
to existing ordinary shareholders. These authorities last until  
21 October 2011 or, if earlier, the conclusion of the next annual  
general meeting. 
At the annual general meeting held on 21 July 2010, shareholders also 
granted authority for the company to make market purchases of up 
to 5,822,255 of its own ordinary shares, being approximately 10% of 
the ordinary share capital then in issue, excluding ordinary shares 
held in treasury, at a price not more than the higher of (a) 5% greater 
than the average of the middle market quotations for such ordinary 
shares during the five business days preceding any such purchase; 
and (b) the higher of (i) the price of the last independent trade in such 
ordinary shares; and (ii) the highest current independent bid relating 
thereto on the trading venue where the purchase is carried out, nor  
at a price less than 5p, being the nominal value of an ordinary share. 
This authority lasts until 21 October 2011 or, if earlier, the conclusion 
of the next annual general meeting. At the same time, shareholders 
who were not members of the Cayzer family concert party  
(‘Cayzer Concert Party’) gave their approval for a waiver by  
the Panel on Takeovers and Mergers of the obligation that could  
arise on the Cayzer Concert Party under Rule 9 of the City Code on 
Takeovers and Mergers to make a general offer for Caledonia on the 
implementation by the company of the above authority to purchase 
its own shares. The approval was subject to the maximum percentage 
of voting rights in which the Cayzer Concert Party is interested not 
exceeding 49.9% as a result of purchases by the company. This 
waiver expires on 21 October 2011 or, if earlier, the conclusion  
of the next annual general meeting.
Change of control agreements
There are no special control rights in relation to the company’s 
shares.
Options granted under the company’s executive share option 
schemes and awards made under the company’s deferred bonus plan 
may become exercisable or vest as a result of a change of control, 
although the number of shares comprised in those options or awards 
may be reduced. The service contracts of certain directors and 
associate directors also contain provisions whereby a liquidated sum 
is payable by the company in the event of termination within one year 
following a change of control. Any such liquidated sum would be 
equivalent to no more than one year’s total emoluments. 
Customers and suppliers
The group’s policy in relation to all of its suppliers is to settle the 
terms of payment when agreeing the terms of the transaction. The 
group will abide by those terms on condition that it is satisfied that 
the supplier has provided the goods or services in accordance with 
the agreed terms and conditions. The group does not follow any code 
or statement on payment practice and Caledonia itself does not have 
any trade payables. Governance 26 Caledonia Investments plc Annual report 2011

Statement of directors’ responsibilities
The directors are responsible for preparing the annual report and  
the financial statements in accordance with applicable law and 
regulations.
Company law requires the directors to prepare financial statements 
for each financial year. Under that law, the directors are required  
to prepare the group financial statements in accordance with 
International Financial Reporting Standards (‘IFRSs’) as adopted by 
the European Union and Article 4 of the IAS Regulation and have also 
chosen to prepare the parent company financial statements under 
IFRSs as adopted by the EU. Under company law, the directors must 
not approve the accounts unless they are satisfied that they give a 
true and fair view of the state of affairs of the company and of the 
profit or loss of the company for that period. In preparing these 
financial statements, International Accounting Standard 1  
requires that directors:
● ● properly select and apply accounting policies
● ● present information, including accounting policies, in a manner 
that provides relevant, reliable, comparable and understandable 
information
● ● provide additional disclosures when compliance with the specific 
requirements in IFRSs are insufficient to enable users to 
understand the impact of particular transactions, other events  
and conditions on the entity’s financial position and financial 
performance
● ● make an assessment of the company’s ability to continue as  
a going concern.
The directors are responsible for keeping proper accounting records 
that are sufficient to show and explain the company’s transactions 
and disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial 
position of the company and enable them to ensure that the financial 
statements comply with the Companies Act 2006. They are also 
responsible for safeguarding the assets of the company and hence  
for taking reasonable steps for the prevention and detection of fraud 
and other irregularities.
The directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity  
of the corporate and financial information included on the  
company’s website. Legislation in the United Kingdom governing  
the preparation and dissemination of financial statements may  
differ from legislation in other jurisdictions.
Going concern
The company’s and group’s business activities, together with the 
factors likely to affect its future development, performance and 
position are set out in the Chief Executive’s report on pages 4  
to 6 and the investment review on pages 8 to 16. The financial  
position of the company and group, its cash flows, liquidity position 
and borrowing facilities are described in the financial review on pages 
17 to 18. In addition, note 21 to the financial statements includes the 
company’s and group’s objectives, policies and processes for managing 
capital, financial risk management objectives, details of financial 
instruments and hedging activities, and exposures to currency risk, 
interest rate risk, price risk, credit risk and liquidity risk.
The company and group have cash resources and committed  
bank facilities available to meet existing and new investment 
commitments. As a consequence, the directors believe that  
the company and group are well placed to manage business  
risks successfully.
The directors have a reasonable expectation that the company  
and group have adequate resources to continue in operational 
existence for the foreseeable future. Accordingly, they continue  
to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the annual report  
and accounts.
Auditors
Resolutions will be proposed at the annual general meeting to 
re-appoint Deloitte LLP as auditors of the company and to authorise 
the directors to agree their remuneration. A description of how  
the Audit Committee ensures the objectivity and independence  
of the auditors is set out on page 28 within the corporate  
governance report. 
The directors who held office at the date of approval of this directors’ 
report confirm that, so far as each is aware, there is no relevant  
audit information of which the company’s auditors are unaware and 
each director has taken all the steps that he ought to have taken as  
a director to make himself aware of any relevant audit information  
and to establish that the company’s auditors are aware of  
that information.

Corporate governance report
Statement of compliance
The board recognises the importance of good corporate governance 
and this report describes how the company has applied the main 
principles of good corporate governance as set out in section one  
of the Combined Code issued in June 2008 (the ‘Combined Code’) 
throughout the year. It also identifies, and provides an explanation 
for, those provisions of section one of the Combined Code with which 
the company did not comply for the whole of the year.
Shareholders registered on the company’s New Zealand branch 
register should note that the principles of good corporate governance 
set out in the Combined Code may materially differ from the New 
Zealand Exchange Ltd’s corporate governance rules and the 
principles of its Corporate Governance Best Practice Code.
A copy of the Combined Code is available on the website of the 
Financial Reporting Council at www.frc.org.uk/corporate/
combinedcode.cfm.
The board
Overall responsibility and operation
The board as a whole is collectively responsible for the success of  
the company. It has adopted a Schedule of Authorities which sets out 
those matters which it specifically reserves for its own decision and 
those which are delegated to board committees and to executive 
management. The roles of the Chairman and the Chief Executive  
are separated and clearly defined in the Schedule of Authorities 
adopted by the board. The Chairman is primarily responsible for  
the efficient operation of the board and the Chief Executive for  
the implementation of the board’s strategy and policies and the 
management of the company’s activities, other than those matters 
specifically reserved to the board. The Schedule of Authorities is 
reviewed annually by the board.
All directors receive detailed papers in advance of board meetings  
to enable them to discharge their duties and also have unlimited 
access to senior management should further information be required. 
Presentations by senior executives of investee companies are also 
arranged periodically to enable the board, and the non-executive 
directors in particular, to gain a closer understanding of some of the 
company’s significant investments.
Appointment, induction and training
Under the Combined Code, all new directors appointed by the board 
were required to seek election by shareholders at the next annual 
general meeting of the company following their appointment and 
subsequently all directors were required to retire by rotation at least 
every three years. Any non-executive director who had served on the 
board for over nine years was subject to annual re-election. The 
company complied with these provisions for its year ended 31 March 
2011, however for its 2011 annual general meeting and for future 
years, it will adopt the recommendation of The UK Corporate 
Governance Code issued in June 2010 that all directors of FTSE 350 
companies should be subject to annual election by shareholders.
On appointment, new directors are offered induction and training 
considered appropriate by the board and subsequently as necessary. 
The Company Secretary provides details of, and where requested 
arranges attendance at, external courses to assist in directors’ 
professional development.
Board composition
The biographies of the directors appear on pages 22 and 23.
The board currently comprises eleven directors. Excluding the 
Chairman, five of the directors are executive and five non-executive. 
The board considers all of the non-executive directors to be 
independent. In assessing Mr Goblet d’Alviella’s independence, the 
board took account of his position as Chief Executive Officer of Sofina 
S.A., whose wholly-owned subsidiary, Rebelco S.A., has a 4.9% 
shareholding in Caledonia. Mr Goblet d’Alviella’s position at Sofina 
has not given rise to any conflicts of interest and his circumstances 
very much accord with the importance that Caledonia attaches to  
its own executives having board positions at investee companies. On 
27 November 2010, Mr Allen-Jones reached the point where he had 
served as a non-executive director for nine years and on 27 May 2011 
Mr Davies will achieve the same milestone. The board (with neither 
director taking any part in the discussions) has specifically 
considered each of these non-executive directors’ independence in 
the context of the Combined Code and The UK Corporate Governance 
Code and does not believe that either’s status is compromised simply 
by length of service. Rather, the experience, character and conduct of 
each director were the board’s determinants of their independence. 
The board has recognised that succession planning is of particular 
importance in the context of their long service, however, as stated  
in the Chairman’s statement, there have been a number of changes  
in key positions on the board in the past two and a half years. 
Accordingly, the Nomination Committee intends to undertake a 
process of gradual refreshment of the non-executive representation 
on the board, whilst balancing the need for continuity and stability.
Prior to 21 July 2010, the board, excluding the Chairman, comprised 
six executive directors and five independent non-executive directors 
and therefore did not comply with provision A.3.2 of the Combined 
Code which requires that, excluding the Chairman, at least half of the 
board should comprise non-executive directors determined by the 
board to be independent. The retirement of Mr Ingram as Chief 
Executive at the annual general meeting held on 21 July 2010 meant 
that, from that date, the composition of the board has complied with 
provision A.3.2. 
Board committees
The board has delegated certain specific areas of responsibility to  
the following standing committees, the terms of reference of which 
are reviewed annually and are available on the company’s website. 
The current membership of these committees, which has remained 
unchanged throughout the year, is noted on page 65.
Nomination Committee
The Nomination Committee, chaired by Mr Loudon, is responsible for 
the regular review of the structure, size and composition (including 
the skills, knowledge and experience) of the board and for giving 
consideration to succession planning for directors and, if requested 
by the board, for other senior executives. It is responsible for 
identifying, using external search consultants where necessary, 
candidates to fill board vacancies as and when they arise, for making 
recommendations to the board in relation thereto and for keeping 
under review the leadership needs of the company, both executive 
and non-executive. It reviews the time required of the non-executive 
directors and ensures that they receive formal letters of appointment 
setting out clearly what is expected of them in terms of time 
commitment, committee service and involvement outside  
board meetings.
The Nomination Committee met twice during the year and the 
principle business undertaken included a formal review of the size 
and composition of the board following the 2010 annual board 
performance evaluation and consideration of the contribution of the 
non-executive directors retiring at the 2010 annual general meeting, 
prior to giving recommendations for their election and re-election.
Remuneration Committee
The Remuneration Committee, chaired by Mr Davies, is responsible 
for the review of executive remuneration policy. Within that policy, 
the Remuneration Committee determines the remuneration packages 
of executive directors and reviews those of other senior executive 
management. It is also responsible for the design of, and grant of 
awards under, the company’s share incentive schemes and for the 
determination of the policy for and scope of pension arrangements, 
service agreements, termination payments and compensation 
commitments for executive directors and, if requested by the board, 
for other senior executives. Governance 28 Caledonia Investments plc Annual report 2011
The Remuneration Committee met four times during the year.  
The matters considered by the Remuneration Committee included:
● ● the approval of the 2010 directors’ remuneration report
● ● the grant of options under the company’s executive share  
option scheme
● ● the determination of Mr Wyatt’s remuneration on his appointment 
as Chief Executive
● ● the exercise of discretions in respect of Mr Ingram’s share awards 
on his retirement in accordance with the rules of the company’s 
executive share option scheme and deferred bonus plan
● ● the determination of basic salaries for executive directors and 
review of salaries for other senior executives for the year 
commencing 1 April 2011
● ● consideration of a review of the company’s executive remuneration 
structures and approval of revised arrangements in relation 
thereto.
Further information on the company’s executive remuneration  
policy and the work of the Remuneration Committee is included in 
the directors’ remuneration report set out on pages 31 to 38.
Audit Committee
The Audit Committee, currently chaired by Mr Allen-Jones, although 
Mr Thompson will be appointed as Chairman of this committee for 
the 2012 financial year, is responsible for the monitoring of the 
integrity of the financial statements of the company and any 
announcements relating to the company’s financial performance  
and for reviewing any significant financial reporting judgements 
contained therein. It also reviews the company’s systems of internal 
control and risk management procedures and considers annually 
whether an internal audit function is required. The Audit Committee 
believes that, in the context of the company’s business as an 
investment trust, the key issues on which it has to satisfy itself are 
the integrity of the application of the company’s policy for the 
valuation of its investments, particularly those which are unlisted, 
and the robustness of the group’s internal controls. The valuations  
of the company’s unlisted investments are subject to formal six 
monthly reviews by an internal Challenge Committee, independent  
of the relevant investment executives, whose meetings are also 
attended by the Chairman of the Audit Committee and the auditors. 
The Audit Committee then selects a number of valuations for specific 
review. A ‘risk dashboard’ highlighting the key business risks facing 
the company and the controls, monitoring procedures and further 
actions needed to mitigate these is maintained by the Finance 
Director and reviewed by the Audit Committee every six months.  
A formal report on the effectiveness of the group’s internal controls 
and risk management procedures is prepared annually for the board 
by the company’s Risk Manager. It is the Audit Committee’s current 
opinion that, in view of these control processes, the size of the 
entities controlled by Caledonia and the relatively straightforward 
control considerations in relation to other investments, a separate 
internal audit function is not necessary.
It is also the Audit Committee’s responsibility to review and monitor 
the independence and objectivity of the external auditors and the 
effectiveness of the audit process and to develop and implement 
policy on the engagement of the external auditors to supply non-audit 
services. In this regard, the Audit Committee has approved a schedule 
of specific non-audit activities which may not be undertaken by  
the external auditors, within the broad principles that the external 
auditors should not audit their own work, should not make 
management decisions on behalf of the company, should not be  
put into the role of advocate for the company and that no mutuality  
of interest should be created between the company and the external 
auditors. The Audit Committee believes that, by applying these 
principles, the objectivity and independence of the auditors is 
maintained, notwithstanding that non-audit work may be 
undertaken. On an annual basis, the Audit Committee considers  
and makes a recommendation to the board as to the appointment, 
re-appointment or removal of the external auditors. The Audit 
Committee is also responsible for the company’s formal whistle 
blowing arrangements, whereby members of staff may raise any 
issues of concern regarding possible impropriety in the conduct  
of the company’s business and whereby any such concerns are 
properly investigated and appropriate action taken.
The Combined Code recommends that at least one member of  
the Audit Committee should have recent and relevant financial 
experience and the Financial Services Authority’s Disclosure  
Rules and Transparency Rules similarly require that one member 
should have competence in accounting and/or auditing. The  
Audit Committee considers that Mr Allen-Jones has met these 
requirements, given his extensive involvement in financial 
transactions as a corporate lawyer and that he is a member  
of the Financial Reporting Review Panel and was previously  
a member of the Financial Reporting Council.
The Audit Committee met three times during the year, and each  
of the meetings included a discussion with the auditors without  
any of the executive directors present. During the year, the business 
undertaken by the Audit Committee included:
● ● a review of the performance of the external auditors, Deloitte LLP, 
and the level of fees charged for their services
● ● scrutiny of valuations of unlisted investments selected by the Audit 
Committee following the half-year and full-year Challenge 
Committee meetings
● ● consideration of the reports from the external auditors concerning 
their audit of the 2010 annual financial statements of the company 
and their review of the 2010 half-year report
● ● consideration of the financial disclosures contained in the 2010 
annual and half-year reports to shareholders and financial 
reporting issues for the 2010 annual report
● ● consideration of the scope of the 2011 annual audit and agreement 
with the external auditors of the key areas of focus
● ● the review of the risk dashboard and reports from the company’s 
Risk Manager on the effectiveness of the group’s internal  
controls and risk management procedures for the year ended  
31 March 2011
● ● consideration of the need or otherwise for an internal  
audit function
● ● a review of the independence and objectivity of the external 
auditors, including their system of quality controls and the  
level and nature of non-audit services provided by them
● ● an evaluation of the performance of the Audit Committee itself 
including a review of its role and responsibilities
● ● consideration of the Bribery Act 2010 and the company’s proposed 
anti-bribery and corruption policy procedures
● ● assurance of the company’s compliance with the requirements  
for approval as an investment trust.
Governance Committee
The Governance Committee, chaired by Mr Allen-Jones, keeps under 
review corporate governance issues relating to the company and  
is responsible for the monitoring and review of the ability of each 
director to act in the interests of shareholders as a whole and to 
exercise independence of judgement free from relationships or 
circumstances which are likely to, or could appear to, affect his 
judgement. The Governance Committee also reviews conflict or 
potential conflict situations relating to directors which may require 
the prior authorisation of the board under the Companies Act 2006 
(the ‘Act’) and makes recommendations to the board as to whether 
such conflict or potential conflict situations should be authorised 
and, if so, whether any conditions, such as duration or scope of the

Board performance evaluation
The board conducts an annual formal evaluation of its performance 
and that of its committees and individual directors. For the year 
ended 31 March 2011, the evaluation of the board as a whole and  
of its committees was led by the Chairman and was conducted by 
inviting individual board members to complete a questionnaire 
regarding the operation and effectiveness of the board as a whole  
and of its committees, the responses from which were collated  
by the Company Secretary and discussed. The evaluation of the 
performance of the Chairman was led by the Senior Independent 
Non-Executive Director and involved individual private discussions 
with all other members of the board (and, in particular, members of 
the Governance Committee) on his performance, the results of which 
were then considered at a meeting of the non-executive directors, 
without the Chairman present. The evaluation of the performance  
of the Chief Executive was undertaken by the Chairman and the 
non-executive directors. The performance of the non-executive 
directors was reviewed by the Chairman, the Chief Executive and  
the Senior Independent Non-Executive Director, with the Senior 
Independent Non-Executive Director absent in respect of his own 
performance appraisal. As part of this review, non-executive 
directors were invited to complete self-assessment questionnaires  
in relation to their own effectiveness. The performance of the 
executive directors, which included further consideration of that  
of the Chief Executive, was undertaken by the Remuneration 
Committee as part of the annual executive salary review process.
The results of the evaluation of the board as a whole and of its 
committees for the year ended 31 March 2011 were presented  
in a report to the board. The main action points arising from  
the evaluation process were the need to undertake a gradual 
refreshment of the board and to improve the company’s total return 
performance as described in the Chairman’s statement and Chief 
Executive’s report. The Nomination Committee also reviewed the 
size, structure and composition of the board in the light of the  
report to the board but in the context that the need for a gradual 
refreshment had already been agreed.
Directors’ conflicts of interest
Each director has a duty under the Act to avoid a situation where  
he has, or could have, a direct or indirect interest which conflicts,  
or may possibly conflict, with the company’s interests. The Act 
however allows directors of public companies to authorise conflicts 
and potential conflicts where the articles of association contain a 
provision to this effect. The Act also allows the articles to contain 
other provisions for dealing with directors’ conflicts of interest to 
avoid a breach of duty.
There are safeguards in the company’s articles which apply when the 
directors decide whether to authorise a conflict or potential conflict 
of interest. First, only independent directors, being those who have 
no interest in the matter being considered, are able to take the 
relevant decision and, second, in taking the decision, the directors 
must act in a way which they consider, in good faith, will be most 
likely to promote the success of the company. The directors are able 
to impose time limits or conditions when giving authorisations if they 
think this is appropriate.
The board has adopted procedures to address the requirements of 
the Act in relation to directors’ conflicts of interest. Each director is 
required to declare any potential conflict situations which may relate 
to him and his connected persons. If necessary, these are reviewed  
by the Governance Committee (with each member taking no part in 
the consideration of his own declaration), which then puts forward 
recommendations to the board as to whether these situations should 
be authorised and, if so, whether any conditions to such authority 
should be attached. The board then considers and approves these 
recommendations, again with each director taking no part in relation 
to his own potential conflict situations.
authority, should be attached. The Governance Committee  
reviews annually all authorisations previously granted by the  
board to ensure that they remain appropriate. If the Governance 
Committee believes that a director may be subject to a conflict of 
interest which may prejudice his ability to exercise independence  
of judgement, it may make such recommendations to the board  
as it may think fit, including that the director abstains from 
participating in any decision of the board or any of its committees  
on the matter concerned.
The Governance Committee met twice during the year, principally  
to review and approve the corporate governance report for the  
year ended 31 March 2010, to review potential conflict situations 
notified by directors in accordance with the Act and to make 
recommendations to the board in relation thereto. The Governance 
Committee also formally considered whether the influence of the 
Cayzer Concert Party on Caledonia’s board was in the general interest 
of the non-Concert Party shareholders and concluded that it was.

Specific control procedures are in place to ensure that the company 
continually monitors and complies with the requirements for 
investment trust status. The board receives monthly compliance 
reports evidencing that the company is meeting the various tests  
for investment trust status and also confirming that the investment 
activities undertaken by executive management are within the policy 
limits set by the board. A Compliance Committee, comprising the 
Company Secretary (Chairman), the Finance Director, the three 
associate directors with responsibility for tax, treasury and finance 
and the Group Financial Controller/Risk Manager, meets weekly  
to review the company’s ongoing compliance with its investment 
trust status and to review and approve all investment activity  
from an investment trust compliance perspective. The Compliance 
Committee also monitors the potential impact of legal and  
regulatory reforms.
Financial performance is continuously measured by comparing total 
shareholder returns and net asset value movements against the FTSE 
All-Share index. Performance statistics are reported monthly to the 
board. Income and expenses are monitored by the board against an 
approved annual budget and regularly updated forecasts. Valuations 
of unlisted investments are subject to a rigorous six monthly review 
process undertaken by a Challenge Committee independent of the 
relevant investment executives, whose meetings are also attended  
by the Chairman of the Audit Committee and auditors, and a selection 
of valuations are then reviewed by the Audit Committee. Where 
appropriate, adjustments are made to the valuations of unlisted 
investments on a monthly basis. All new investment activity and 
disposals are subject to formal approval by an Approvals Committee 
comprising the Chairman, the executive directors and the  
Company Secretary.
Since the year end, the directors have concluded their annual review 
of the operation and effectiveness of the group’s system of internal 
control. No material control failings or weaknesses were identified.
Relations with shareholders
The company welcomes dialogue with institutional shareholders  
in order to achieve a mutual understanding of objectives. The Chief 
Executive and the Finance Director seek meetings with larger 
institutional shareholders and private client stockbrokers after  
the announcement of year end and half-year results. The Senior 
Independent Non-Executive Director attends some of these meetings. 
The annual general meeting also provides a forum for shareholders 
to meet the directors, both formally and informally.
The Chairmen of all of the board’s committees will be available to 
answer questions at the annual general meeting of the company.
Each board meeting includes a standing agenda item on conflicts  
of interest to ensure that directors disclose any new potential  
conflict situations. These are then reviewed, if necessary also  
by the Governance Committee, and authorised by the board as 
appropriate. A register of directors’ conflicts of interest is 
maintained by the Company Secretary and reviewed annually  
by the Governance Committee.
Internal control
The board has overall responsibility for the group’s systems of risk 
management and internal control, although the detailed review of 
risk management procedures and internal controls is delegated to 
the Audit Committee. The group’s system of internal control is 
designed to manage, rather than eliminate, risk of failure to achieve 
business objectives. It is recognised that such a system can only 
provide reasonable, but not absolute, assurance against material 
misstatement or loss. The board confirms that the system of internal 
control operated by the group accords with the Turnbull Guidance 
2005 and has been in place throughout the year and up to the date  
of approval of these financial statements.
The board monitors the key risks facing the company through a  
‘risk dashboard’ maintained by the Finance Director, which identifies 
the significant business risks to which the company is exposed at  
any particular time (broadly categorised under company strategy, 
market risk, operational risk, financial risk and subsidiary company 
risk) and the controls and monitoring procedures in place to  
mitigate these, together with any outstanding actions and progress 
undertaken in relation thereto. Each risk is scored according to 
potential impact and likelihood, from which an overall risk factor  
is derived and compared against a target score, with changes in the 
risk assessment continuously updated by way of an agenda item at 
the weekly meetings of the Investment Management Committee.  
The risk dashboard is formally reviewed in detail by the Audit 
Committee and then by the board on a six monthly basis.
Major business risks facing group and key investee companies  
are identified and assessed by local management and procedures  
are agreed to address these as appropriate. The boards of these 
companies review business risk and controls regularly to ensure  
the system of risk management operates effectively. Caledonia’s 
investment executives then confirm, through Caledonia’s Risk 
Manager, to the Audit Committee that the system of risk  
management is operating effectively for these group companies  
and key investments.
Key investment and market risks identified are regularly monitored 
at company level by members of the Investment Management 
Committee, who have clear mandates to assess and report on risk  
in their particular areas of responsibility. All of the company’s 
significant investments are reviewed at least annually by the board 
and the smaller portfolio holdings reviewed at least annually by the 
Investment Management Committee. The Risk Manager produces 
reports for the Audit Committee on specific risk areas as and  
when requested.

Directors’ remuneration report
This report has been prepared in accordance with Part 15 of the 
Companies Act 2006 and related regulations. The tables included in 
the statements below on directors’ remuneration, pensions, share 
options and deferred share awards have been audited.
The Remuneration Committee
The Remuneration Committee is a standing committee of the board 
whose current members are Mr Davies (Chairman), Mr Allen-Jones, 
Mr Gregson and Mr Thompson. All of the members served throughout 
the year. 
The Remuneration Committee, whose written terms of reference are 
published on the company’s website, has been established for the 
following purposes:
● ● To determine and agree with the board the framework and broad 
policy for the remuneration of the executive directors and such 
other members of the executive management as it is requested by 
the board to consider and to review the on-going appropriateness 
and relevance of the remuneration policy.
● ● To approve the design of, and determine targets for, any 
performance related pay schemes operated by the company and  
to approve the total annual payments made under such schemes.
● ● To review the design of all share incentive plans for approval by the 
board and shareholders and, for any such plans, to determine each 
year whether awards will be made and, if so, the overall amount  
of such awards, the individual awards to executive directors and 
other senior executives and the performance targets to be used.
● ● Within the terms of the agreed policy, to determine the total 
individual remuneration packages of each executive director  
and, if requested by the board, other senior executives, including, 
where appropriate, bonuses, incentive payments, share options 
and other awards.
● ● To determine the policy for, and scope of, pension arrangements, 
service agreements, termination payments and compensation 
commitments for executive directors and, if requested by the 
board, other senior executives.
● ● To review and assess annually the remuneration trends across  
the company.
The Remuneration Committee also determines the fees of the 
Chairman.
During the year, the Remuneration Committee received advice from 
Towers Watson, independent remuneration consultants appointed  
by the Remuneration Committee, who undertook a review of the 
company’s executive remuneration structures in the context of 
current market practice, which included an assessment of the 
comparability of senior executive remuneration packages with  
the market place for the purpose of setting executive directors’ 
salaries for the year commencing 1 April 2011. In addition, Towers 
Watson undertook a review of the company’s long term incentive 
arrangements as described further below. Towers Watson principally 
advised in relation to the remuneration of executive directors and 
senior management. The Remuneration Committee also consulted 
with the Chairman and the Chief Executive in relation to the 
remuneration of the executive directors. Internal support was 
provided to the Remuneration Committee by the Company Secretary.
Remuneration policy for executive directors
During the year, the Remuneration Committee conducted a review  
of the company’s executive remuneration arrangements with the 
assistance of its independent remuneration consultants, Towers 
Watson. The purpose of the review was (a) to ensure that the 
company’s remuneration structures remained aligned to the risk/
reward characteristics of Caledonia’s objective of providing a long 
term store of wealth for its shareholders, (b) to continue to provide  
a suitable framework to incentivise the company’s senior executive 
team and (c) to reflect current market practice, but within its existing 
policy that:
● ● Performance related remuneration should seek to align the 
interests of the executive directors with those of the shareholders.
● ● A significant portion of the executive directors’ remuneration 
packages should be linked to the performance of the company.
● ● Remuneration packages for the executive directors should be 
competitive, but not excessive, in terms of market practice, in order 
to attract, retain and motivate executive directors of the quality 
needed to manage and grow the company successfully.
As a result of this review, the Remuneration Committee is proposing 
to replace the current executive share option scheme and deferred 
bonus plan with a new performance share scheme and an updated 
deferred bonus plan, shareholder approval for both of which will  
be sought, under separate resolutions, at the forthcoming annual 
general meeting.
In order to align further the interests of the executive directors with 
those of shareholders, the Remuneration Committee has adopted 
guidelines for minimum shareholdings which executive directors  
will be expected to attain over a reasonable period of time. For these 
purposes, shareholdings include the value to executive directors, net 
of associated income tax and national insurance, of options granted 
under the company’s executive share option schemes for which the 
performance targets have been met and bonus deferred into shares, 
both compulsorily and voluntarily, under the company’s deferred 
bonus plan. For the Chief Executive, the minimum guideline 
shareholding has been set at a value of 200% of basic salary and  
for all other executive directors 150% of basic salary. The current 
shareholdings of all of the executive directors meet these guidelines, 
other than of Mr King, who has only recently joined the company.
In determining executive directors’ remuneration, consideration is 
given to matters specific to the company, such as the performance  
of its net asset value (‘NAV’) per share, both in absolute terms and as 
measured against the FTSE All-Share index, to the experience and 
performance of individual directors and to their areas of responsibility. 
The Remuneration Committee also gives consideration to a report 
prepared by the Company Secretary on pay and employment 
conditions through the Caledonia group, although, given that 
Caledonia’s trading subsidiaries operate in a number of diverse 
industries and geographical locations using both skilled and 
unskilled workforces, the executive directors’ pay is principally set 
by the Remuneration Committee in the context of that of Caledonia’s 
head office staff. Comparable external market data is also taken into 
account as a point of reference to determine appropriate 
remuneration packages for specific roles.
It is currently intended that the policy statement set out in this report 
will apply for the year to 31 March 2012 and for subsequent years. 
However, the Remuneration Committee considers that an effective 
remuneration policy needs to be sufficiently flexible and kept under 
review in order to take account of future changes in the company’s 
business environment and in remuneration practice. Accordingly,  
the policy may be amended in future years. Any changes in policy  
for financial years after 31 March 2012 will be described in future 
directors’ remuneration reports, which will continue to be subject  
to an advisory vote of shareholders. All statements in this report in 
relation to remuneration policy for years after 31 March 2012 should 
be read in this light. Governance 32 Caledonia Investments plc Annual report 2011
Policy on individual components of executive directors’ 
remuneration
Basic salary
Basic salary is determined by the Remuneration Committee by 
reference to the experience and responsibilities of the director 
concerned and taking into account external market research. The 
company’s policy is to pay salaries and other benefits which are 
competitive, but not excessive, in relation to the marketplace.
Benefits
The company provides a range of benefits, including cash allowances 
in lieu of company cars, life insurance, permanent health insurance 
and private medical cover.
Bonus
The company operates a discretionary annual bonus scheme for 
executive directors, which takes into account both the performance 
of individual directors and the performance of the company. At the 
determination of the Remuneration Committee, and subject to the 
compulsory deferral provisions of the company’s deferred bonus 
plan, bonuses may either be paid in cash or as employer contributions 
to registered pension schemes.
The maximum potential bonus that may currently be awarded is 
100% of basic salary, of which a maximum of 50% of basic salary  
is determined by reference to the company’s performance and 50%  
by reference to individual performance. The company performance 
related element of bonus is determined by reference to the 
performance of the company’s diluted NAV per share compared  
with that of the FTSE All-Share index over the financial year.  
Bonus payments commence if the performance of the company’s  
NAV per share matches that of the FTSE All-Share index, increasing 
incrementally to the maximum entitlement payable if NAV per share 
outperforms the FTSE All-Share index by 6% or more. The individual 
performance element is measured by reference to performance 
objectives set at the start of the financial year.
For the financial year ending 31 March 2012, and for future years,  
the Remuneration Committee intends to change the existing bonus 
arrangements in two respects – first by adopting the relative 
performance of the company’s diluted NAV per share on a total 
return basis against the FTSE All-Share Total Return index as the 
measure of the company performance related element and second, 
for executive directors with responsibility for specific pools of 
capital, to link a significant proportion of bonus to the performance 
and objectives of their individual pools. For these directors, the 
maximum potential bonus of 100% of basic salary will be determined 
as to 25% by reference to the company’s performance, 60% to pool 
performance and objectives and 15% to individual performance.
All bonus payments are subject to the overriding discretion of the 
Remuneration Committee and circumstances where such discretion 
may be used to reduce the amount of bonus payable include where 
NAV per share growth in the financial year is negative and/or  
NAV per share outperformance over the relevant financial year 
merely represents recovery from previous underperformance.  
In exceptional circumstances, the Remuneration Committee may  
also award bonuses outside the terms of the company’s annual bonus 
scheme. No bonus payments are pensionable.
Deferred bonus plan
The company’s bonus arrangements are also designed to align the 
interests of directors with those of shareholders and to encourage 
retention by requiring, in the Remuneration Committee’s absolute 
discretion, that a proportion of any bonus paid to a director is 
compulsorily invested in shares under the company’s deferred bonus 
plan. The Remuneration Committee’s current policy is that any 
annual bonus paid, the amount of which is above 50% of a director’s 
basic salary for the financial year to which the bonus relates, must  
be so compulsorily invested. Shares derived from the compulsory 
deferral of bonus are matched on a one for one basis, the vesting of 
which is subject to the satisfaction of performance conditions over 
a period of three years.
In addition, the deferred bonus plan entitles directors to convert 
voluntarily a proportion of any remaining cash bonus to an 
entitlement to shares. The Remuneration Committee’s current policy 
is that up to half of any bonus not subject to compulsory deferral  
may be voluntarily converted into shares. The shares awarded for 
voluntary bonus deferral are also eligible for matching, on a one  
for one basis, the vesting of which is subject to the satisfaction of 
performance conditions over a period of three years. Bonuses 
awarded for the 2012 financial year will be subject to a new deferred 
bonus plan, if approved by shareholders, details of which are set out 
below. Awards under the deferred bonus plan are not pensionable.
In connection with the review of the company’s executive 
remuneration structures, the Remuneration Committee wishes to 
obtain shareholder approval for a new deferred bonus plan (‘2011 
Plan’) to replace the existing deferred bonus plan operated by the 
company. The 2011 Plan will first be used in 2012 in relation to 
bonuses awarded for the 2012 financial year and, if the 2011 Plan is 
approved by shareholders, no further awards will be granted under 
the existing deferred bonus plan. The terms of the 2011 Plan will be 
the same as the current deferred bonus plan (details of which are set 
out on pages 35 to 36) but the 2011 Plan will introduce revised 
performance targets for the matching share awards which are 
considered to be more relevant to Caledonia’s current strategy  
and objectives. Under these targets, the vesting of matching shares 
will be dependent on the company’s performance over a three year 
period by reference to two separate performance conditions. Both 
conditions will relate to the performance of Caledonia’s diluted  
NAV per share on a total return basis over the three financial years 
starting with the year in which the award is made. For two-thirds  
of the matching shares awarded, the performance of diluted NAV  
per share on a total return basis will be compared against the FTSE 
All-Share Total Return index and, for the other one-third, the 
comparison will be against the FTSE Actuaries UK Index-linked Gilts 
(all stocks) Total Return index. Vesting of matching shares will be on 
a graduated basis, commencing with 10% vesting on the achievement 
of 0.5% outperformance of the relevant index, rising on a straight line 
basis to 100% vesting on 3.5% outperformance of the relevant index. 
There will be no re-testing of either of the performance conditions.
The Remuneration Committee may amend the performance targets  
if events occur that would make the amended targets a fairer 
measure of performance and provided that any amended targets are 
no more difficult to satisfy. The Remuneration Committee will also 
have the ability to impose different performance targets in the 
future, provided that any targets imposed are no less demanding 
than described above. Any such amended or different performance 
targets will be described in the directors’ remuneration report for 
the relevant year. A detailed summary of the 2011 Plan is set out in 
the circular to shareholders containing the notice of the annual 
general meeting and which accompanies this annual report.

order to bring the company’s long term incentive arrangements more 
into line with current market practice and also to address the key 
conclusions of the review that:
● ● the structure and level of grants made under the 2005 executive 
share option scheme (under which the exercise price is equal to the 
share’s market value at the date of grant) is out of line with market 
practice and that the performance targets applicable to those 
options are such that there is a low likelihood of options vesting
● ● the company should move to a performance share scheme, under 
which, to the extent that a performance condition is satisfied, 
shares could be called (without payment) under a nil-cost option
● ● the expected value of options granted under the 2005 executive 
share option scheme (that is, taking account of the intrinsic value 
of the options) was too low when set against market comparables.
To address this, the Remuneration Committee intends to increase  
the expected value of the long term incentive element of the 
remuneration package.
Under the 2011 Scheme, participants will be awarded nil-cost options 
over shares, rather than options based on the current market value  
of those shares. The maximum value of nil-cost options that may  
be granted in any year will be increased to 200% of basic salary, 
although, because nil-cost options have a higher expected value than 
market-value options, the Remuneration Committee’s policy will be 
typically to grant awards of no more than 125% of basic salary.
Nil-cost options awarded under the 2011 Scheme will be subject  
to performance targets related to the company’s diluted NAV per 
share on a total return basis measured against a benchmark index. 
For two-thirds of the shares comprised in a nil-cost option, the 
benchmark will be the FTSE All-Share Total Return index and, for  
the remaining one-third, the benchmark will be the FTSE Actuaries 
UK Index-linked Gilts (all stocks) Total Return index. In each case  
the performance period will be a period of three financial years 
measured at the end of the third financial year following the date of 
grant of the nil-cost options. Nil-cost options will vest on a graduated 
basis, with 10% vesting on 0.5% outperformance of the relevant 
benchmark, rising on a straight line basis to maximum vesting on 
3.5% outperformance of the relevant benchmark. There will be no 
re-testing of either performance target and, to the extent that a 
performance target is not met, the relevant nil-cost options will lapse.
The Remuneration Committee may amend the performance targets  
if events occur that would make the amended targets a fairer measure 
of performance and provided that any amended targets are no more 
difficult to satisfy. The Remuneration Committee will also have the 
ability to impose different performance targets in the future, provided 
that any targets imposed are no less demanding than described above. 
Any such amended or different performance targets will be described 
in the directors’ remuneration report for the relevant year.
To the extent that a performance target is met, nil-cost options may 
be exercised between the date of vesting and the tenth anniversary  
of the date of grant, except that only two-thirds of the shares that 
have vested may normally be exercisable after three years from 
grant, with the remaining one-third normally becoming exercisable 
five years after grant. On exercisable, the participant will also receive 
an amount equal to the dividends that would have accrued on the 
shares comprised in the nil-cost options during the relevant three  
or five year period.
A detailed summary of the terms of the 2011 Scheme is set out in the 
circular to shareholders containing the notice of the annual general 
meeting and which accompanies this annual report.
Pensions
The company’s policy on pensions is to provide a means whereby 
executive directors either receive a pension at retirement age from 
the company, or are funded to operate their own personal pension 
plans or other arrangements. The Hon C W Cayzer is a member  
of the Caledonia Pension Scheme, which is a defined benefits scheme 
and is contributory for employees who joined the company after  
1 April 1988, but which is now closed to new members. This scheme 
provides a pension of up to two-thirds of final pensionable salary on 
retirement dependent on length of service and age and also provides 
for dependants’ pensions. The Hon C W Cayzer transferred into the 
scheme from The Union-Castle Line Superannuation Scheme which 
was non-contributory, and this status has been preserved.
None of Messrs King, May or Wyatt participate in a company pension 
scheme, but instead a fixed percentage of basic salary is paid into 
personal pension arrangements or may, at their choice, be paid as a 
cash supplement, which is reduced by such amount as is necessary  
to ensure that the cash payment is cost neutral for the company after 
taking into account the company’s national insurance contributions. 
The percentage of basic salary for the year ended 31 March 2011  
was 12.5% for each director, although Mr Wyatt’s contribution  
was increased to 20% of basic salary on his appointment as Chief 
Executive on 21 July 2010. Mr Cayzer-Colvin participates in the 
Caledonia Group Personal Pension Plan (‘GPPP’), a defined 
contribution scheme into which employer contributions of 12.5% of 
basic salary were made on his behalf. For the portion of the financial 
year until his retirement on 21 July 2010, Mr Ingram was entitled to 
receive an employer pension contribution or cash alternative based 
on 25% of his basic salary. For the year ending 31 March 2012 
onwards, the Remuneration Committee has agreed that the employer 
pension contributions or cash alternatives should be based on 22.5% 
of basic salary for Mr Wyatt and 17.5% for Messrs Cayzer-Colvin, 
King and May.
It is the company’s policy that any future executive directors 
recruited from outside the company will be funded to operate their 
own pension arrangements or offered participation in a company 
sponsored defined contribution scheme and that the company will 
not offer participation in any defined benefits arrangements.
Share options
A key objective of the company’s remuneration policy is to motivate 
executive directors to deliver long term shareholder value. The 
Remuneration Committee believes that this is best achieved  
through the grant of share options, exercisable only if demanding 
performance conditions are met. The grant of options is considered 
to be a key element of the remuneration package, alongside annual 
salary, annual bonus and the deferred bonus plan.
Under the 2005 executive share option scheme (under which the 
exercise price is equal to a share’s market value at the date of grant), 
the maximum value of options that may be granted in any year  
to a director is 150% of basic salary, measured by reference to  
the aggregate exercise price of such options. The Remuneration 
Committee may exceed this limit for individual directors where it 
considers it necessary to do so to secure their appointment, provided 
that the maximum value that may be granted in such circumstances 
shall not exceed 250% of basic salary. No options are granted  
at a discount.
As a consequence of its review of Caledonia’s executive remuneration 
structures, the Remuneration Committee is seeking shareholder 
approval to establish a new executive performance share scheme 
‘2011 Scheme’) to replace the existing executive share option scheme 
which was established in 2005. The 2011 Scheme is proposed in  Governance 34 Caledonia Investments plc Annual report 2011

Policy on executive directors’ service contracts
It is the policy of the company that no executive director should be 
offered a service contract that cannot be terminated on more than 
one year’s notice or which contains provision for predetermined 
compensation in excess of one year’s total emoluments. All  
existing directors’ service contracts comply with this policy. The 
Remuneration Committee has regard to compensation commitments 
and believes that these are best addressed by restricting the term  
of the contract. In the event of a termination, the Remuneration 
Committee would consider all the relevant factors and circumstances 
and seek a just solution. It is the Remuneration Committee’s intention 
that all future executive directors’ service contracts should include 
provisions enabling the company to reduce compensation payments 
in the event that the director takes up alternative employment within 
the notice period to which such payments relate.
Policy on external non-executive directorships held by  
executive directors
It is the company’s policy to allow executive directors to hold 
external non-executive directorships unrelated to the company’s 
business, provided that the time commitment required is not 
material. Normally the company will retain any fees arising from 
such non-executive directorships, but may permit the executive 
director to retain fees in certain circumstances. Details of any such 
fees retained by executive directors are disclosed in the statement  
on directors’ remuneration below.
Policy on the Chairman’s and non-executive directors’ terms  
of appointment and remuneration
It is the company’s policy that the Chairman and the non-executive 
directors should be appointed for fixed periods of no more than  
three years (from the next annual general meeting following  
initial appointment in the case of new appointments) and that  
re-appointment at the end of such periods should not be automatic.
The Chairman receives an annual fee determined by the 
Remuneration Committee but does not receive any other emoluments. 
Non-executive directors are paid an annual fee determined by the 
board within the overall limit contained in the articles of association, 
but do not receive any other benefits from the company for their 
services as non-executive directors. For the year ended 31 March 
2011, the fee for the Chairman was £162,000. The basic fee for the 
non-executive directors was £35,000 and additionally fees of £4,900 
and £4,300 respectively were paid to the Chairmen of the Audit and 
Remuneration Committees and £2,000 and £1,400 respectively to  
the other members of those committees. A further £4,500 was paid  
to Mr Allen-Jones for his roles as Senior Independent Non-Executive 
Director and Chairman of the Governance Committee. For the year 
ending 31 March 2012, the basic non-executive directors’ fee will be 
£36,250, the fee for the Chairmen of the Audit and Remuneration 
Committees will be £5,100 and £4,450 respectively and membership 
fees for these Committees will be £2,100 and £1,450 respectively.  
The Senior Independent Non-Executive Director/Governance 
Committee Chairman’s fee will be £4,650.
Non-executive directors may also be paid additional fees agreed by 
the board where they have performed services that, in the opinion  
of the board, are over and above their normal duties. 
The company is entitled to terminate the Chairman’s or a non-
executive director’s appointment at any time without compensation.
Performance graph
The graph below shows the company’s total shareholder return 
(‘TSR’) against that of the FTSE All-Share Total Return index for  
the five financial years ending on 31 March 2011. TSR has been 
calculated assuming that all dividends are reinvested on their 
ex-dividend date. The FTSE All-Share Total Return index has been 
chosen as it is the benchmark by which the company measures its 
delivery of shareholder value over the longer term.

Overview Business review Governance Financial statements Other information
earlier of three years from the first day of the financial year in which 
the award is made or the date the director ceases to be an employee 
of the Caledonia group for any reason.
Matching share awards
The vesting of the matching shares is dependent on the company’s 
performance over a three year period, by reference to two separate 
performance conditions. Both performance conditions relate to the 
performance of Caledonia’s NAV per share over the three financial 
years starting with the year in which the award is made (‘Prescribed 
Period’). This performance of NAV per share will be compared 
against different indices as follows:
● ● 50% of the matching shares will only vest if NAV per share over  
the Prescribed Period outperforms the Retail Prices Index by at 
least 9%
● ● 50% of the matching shares will only vest if NAV per share over  
the Prescribed Period outperforms the FTSE All-Share index by  
at least 3%.
There will be no re-testing of either performance condition.
The Remuneration Committee may amend the performance target  
if events occur that would make the amended target a fairer measure 
of performance and provided that any amended target is no more 
difficult to satisfy. The Remuneration Committee will also have  
the ability to impose different performance targets in the future, 
provided that any targets that are imposed are no less demanding 
than those described above. Any such amended or different 
performance targets will be described in the directors’  
remuneration report for the relevant year.
Deferred share awards held as at 31 March 2011 (or date of 
retirement if earlier) by directors who served during the year are 
shown in the following table. Other than in respect of Mr Ingram, the 
awards shown as lapsed are all of the matching awards granted on 
3 June 2008 and 29 July 2008 which failed to meet their performance 
targets tested as at 31 March 2011. In the case of Mr Ingram, the 
Remuneration Committee determined at his retirement on 21 July 
2010 that, based on the measurement of the performance targets 
from the relevant grant date to his retirement, all of his matching 
awards granted in 2008 should lapse.
There have been no changes in directors’ deferred share awards  
up to the date of this report.
In addition to the amounts shown in the table above, Messrs  
Wyatt, King and May respectively were paid amounts of £17,655, 
£35,383 and £39,411 before tax (2010 – £nil, £10,704 and £37,677 
respectively) in lieu of contributions to their personal pension 
arrangements as described in the statement on directors’ pensions 
below. Mr King also held an external non-executive directorship of 
Weir Group during the year, which was unrelated to the company’s 
business and where it had been agreed that he could retain the fees 
arising therefrom, as he took up the appointment before he joined 
Caledonia. Mr King received fees from Weir Group of £52,500  
(2010 – £16,523 from date of appointment as a director of Caledonia).
For the part of the year until his retirement on 21 July 2010, in 
addition to the emoluments shown in the table above, Mr Ingram  
was paid an amount in lieu of pension contributions of £18,419  
(2010 – £68,521). Mr Ingram was also a non-executive director  
of Sage Group during this period, an external directorship from 
which he received and retained fees of £19,945 (2010 – £65,000).
Directors’ deferred share awards
The deferred bonus column in the table of directors’ emoluments 
shows the amount (if any) of bonus to be compulsorily and 
voluntarily deferred into shares under the company’s deferred bonus 
plan. The number of shares awarded for both the compulsory and 
voluntary deferral of bonus is determined by reference to the market 
value of a share at the time the award is made, which occurs shortly 
after the announcement of the company’s results for the financial 
year to which the bonus relates (or following the occurrence of 
exceptional circumstances justifying the making of awards). In both 
cases, the number of shares is set on a pre-tax basis (as the shares 
will be subject to income tax and national insurance on release). 
Matching shares are awarded in respect of compulsory and  
voluntary deferral of bonus on a one for one basis.
Compulsorily deferred share awards
The shares comprised in a compulsory deferral will normally only 
vest (together with an amount equal to the dividends that would have 
accrued on those shares) if the director remains an employee of the 
Caledonia group for a three year period commencing on the first day 
of the financial year in which the award is made. The vesting of these 
shares is not subject to a further performance condition.
Voluntarily deferred share awards
The shares comprised in a voluntary deferral are not subject to a 
performance condition and will vest (together with an amount equal 
to the dividends that would have accrued on those shares) at the

Statement on directors’ pensions (audited)
Pension benefits accrued by The Hon C W Cayzer during the year 
under the company’s defined benefits scheme were as follows:
Row 
ref £ 
Accrued pension at 31 March 2011 a 149,143 
Increase in accrued pension during the year b 18,476 
Increase in accrued pension during the year,

Transfer value of accrued pension  
at 31 March 2010 f 1,791,350 
Change in transfer value over the year g 286,553 
1.  The accrued pension shown in row (a) was the amount which would be paid at normal 
retirement age, ignoring any revaluation, if The Hon C W Cayzer had left service at 31 March 2011.
2.  The transfer value shown in row (d) represented the value of the increase in accrued pension 
(net of inflation) during the year, as set out in row (c).
3.  The change in transfer value over the year shown in row (g) (calculated as row (e) less row (f)) 
reflected the impact on the transfer value of factors beyond the control of the company and the 
directors, such as movements in stock markets. These can cause transfer values at different 
points in time to fluctuate significantly. Disclosed changes in value may therefore be subject to 
a large degree of volatility and may even be negative.
4.  The transfer value was the present value of the accrued deferred pension and associated 
benefits at 31 March 2011, calculated using the transfer basis then in force. Transfer values are 
calculated using the transfer value basis as determined by the trustees of the Caledonia 
Pension Scheme.
Mr Wyatt has established his own money purchase pension 
arrangements, into which the company made employer contributions 
of £55,275 (2010 – £30,625) and in addition to which, and in 
accordance with his service contract, he was paid cash in lieu of 
pension contributions of £17,655. In accordance with their service 
contracts, Mr King and Mr May elected to receive their pension 
entitlements by way of cash payments in lieu of pension contributions 
of £35,383 and £39,411 respectively (2010 – £10,704 and £37,677 
respectively). Mr Cayzer-Colvin is a member of the GPPP, a defined 
contribution scheme into which employer contributions of £33,750 
(2010 – £30,625) were paid during the year on his behalf. For the part 
of the year until his retirement on 21 July 2010, and in accordance 
with his service contract, the company paid £20,000 into Mr Ingram’s 
personal pension plan, in addition to which he was paid cash in lieu  
of pension contributions of £18,419 (2010 – £55,208 and £68,521 
respectively).
Statement on directors’ share options (audited)
Options to acquire ordinary shares in the company held by those 
directors who served during the year ended 31 March 2011, or to 
date of retirement if earlier, and gains on the exercise of share 
options were as shown in the following table. The options shown  
as lapsed are those granted on 3 June 2008 which failed to meet 
either of their performance targets, tested as at 31 March 2011.  
In the case of Mr Ingram, the lapsed options also include HMRC 
approved options over 864 shares granted on 29 May 2009 which  
the Remuneration Committee determined should lapse at the date  
of his retirement on 21 July 2010, based on the performance targets 
measured up to that date.
In respect of Mr Ingram’s retirement, the Remuneration Committee 
exercised its discretion under the 2005 executive share option 
scheme such that all of the share options granted to him up to 2006, 
which had satisfied their performance targets prior to his retirement 
date (being an aggregate of 52,848 shares), would become fully 
exercisable for a period of one year following his retirement date.  
The Remuneration Committee further agreed that unapproved 
options over a total of 93,401 shares granted to Mr Ingram in 2008 
and 2009 should, subject to satisfying their performance targets  
at the end of their normal three year performance measurement 
period, be exercisable within one year from the date on which the 
performance targets calculations are determined. As stated above, 
the performance targets for options granted in 2008 were tested  
as at 31 March 2011 and were not achieved. Accordingly, the options 
over 40,151 shares granted to Mr Ingram on 3 June 2008 have lapsed. 
The Remuneration Committee also exercised its discretion in respect 
of HMRC approved options over 1,729 shares granted to Mr Ingram 
on 29 May 2009 and, based on the measurement of the performance 
targets up to the date of his retirement, determined that options over 
865 shares should become fully exercisable within twelve months of 
his retirement date and the balance, being options over 864 shares, 
should, as stated above, lapse.
There have been no changes in directors’ options to acquire ordinary 
shares up to the date of this report.
The company currently has two executive share option schemes –  
a 1998 scheme under which option grants were made from 
September 1998 to May 2004 and a 2005 scheme under which  
option grants commenced in August 2005.
Under the terms of both schemes, options may be exercised between 
three and ten years after the date of grant, although only one-third of 
the shares comprised in an option may be exercised after three years 
from grant, with the remaining two-thirds becoming exercisable six 
years after grant. Options may only be exercised if performance 
targets are met. On 25 March 2010, the Remuneration Committee 
amended the rules of the 1998 scheme such that certain options 
granted on 26 May 2004 (which had already met their performance 
targets and would ordinarily have become fully exercisable on  
26 May 2010), became exercisable on or after 25 March 2010 and 
therefore shortly before their normal sixth anniversary date.
For options granted in 2002 and 2003 under the 1998 scheme, the 
performance target requires the company’s adjusted NAV per share 
to outperform either the Retail Prices Index by 9%, or the FTSE 
All-Share index, over any consecutive three financial years prior  
to expiry. For options granted in 2004, the performance target is  
such that 50% of the shares comprised in an option will vest if the 
company’s NAV per share outperforms the Retail Prices Index by  
at least 9% over the relevant measurement period, with the other 
50% vesting if the company’s NAV per share outperforms the  
FTSE All-Share index over the relevant measurement period.  
The performance measure has to be achieved either over the first 
three years, or over the first four years, after the date of grant.  
If the performance measure is not achieved four years after the  
date of grant, the options will lapse.
The performance target for the 2005 scheme requires that 50%  
of the shares comprised in an option will vest if Caledonia’s NAV per 
share outperforms the Retail Prices Index by at least 9% over the 
measurement period. The other 50% of the shares comprised in the 
option will vest if NAV per share outperforms the FTSE All-Share 
index by at least 3% over the measurement period. The measurement 
period for these purposes is the period of three financial years 
measured at the end of the third financial year following the date  
of grant of the options. There is no re-testing of the performance 
targets. To the extent that the performance target is not met over  
this three year period, the options will lapse.

appropriate benchmark for the company’s other objective of 
achieving a positive total return over rolling five year periods.  
As stated above, for the financial year ending 31 March 2012 and  
for future years, the Remuneration Committee intends to change the 
performance benchmark to the FTSE All-Share Total Return index  
for both the company’s annual bonus scheme and its longer term 
share plans as it regards a total return basis as a more appropriate 
measure of the company’s objectives. The Remuneration Committee 
is also proposing to replace the Retail Prices Index with the FTSE 
Actuaries UK Index-linked Gilts (all stocks) Total Return index as  
the other benchmark for its longer term share plans as it regards  
the latter as more reflective of the company’s aim to provide a long 
term store of wealth for its shareholders.
As at 31 March 2011, the market price of the company’s shares was 
1725p (2010 – 1625p) and the range during the year was 1532p

1. Mr Ingram retired as a director on 21 July 2010. Included within the options granted on 29 May 2009 are 865 HMRC approved options which are only exercisable until 21 July 2011.
The performance targets have been met for all outstanding options 
shown in the table above granted up to 2006. The options granted in 
2008 have failed to achieve either of their performance targets and 
accordingly all have lapsed.
The Remuneration Committee has selected the FTSE All-Share index 
as the performance measure for both the company’s shorter term 
annual bonus scheme and its longer term share plans as it believes 
that this is the best way to incentivise executives to deliver continued 
strong NAV per share performance, which underpins Caledonia’s

Return index over five and ten year periods. TSR itself has not  
been chosen as a measure of executive management performance,  
as this may be affected by the level of Caledonia’s share price 
discount, which can be influenced by factors outside the company’s 
control. The Retail Prices Index has also been chosen as a 
performance measure for the company’s longer term incentive  
plans, as the Remuneration Committee believes that this is an  Governance 38 Caledonia Investments plc Annual report 2011
Statement on executive directors’ service contracts and the 
Chairman’s and non-executive directors’ letters of appointment
Executive directors have service contracts with Caledonia Group 
Services Ltd, a wholly-owned subsidiary of the company, details of 
which are summarised below:
Name Date of contract Notice period Unexpired term
W P Wyatt 02.06.05 12 months Rolling 12 months
The Hon C W Cayzer 11.06.02 12 months Rolling 12 months
J M B Cayzer-Colvin 19.04.05 12 months Rolling 12 months
S A King 19.11.09 12 months Rolling 12 months
J M May 01.09.03 12 months Rolling 12 months
Directors’ service contracts contain provisions whereby the company 
may, at its discretion, terminate the contract without notice and 
make a lump sum payment in lieu of notice and (other than in the case  
of Mr King’s service contract) whereby a liquidated sum is payable  
in the event of termination within one year following a change of 
control. Any such payment in lieu of notice or liquidated sum would 
be equivalent to no more than one year’s total emoluments. Mr King’s 
service contract contains provisions whereby, as an alternative  
to the payment of a lump sum in lieu of notice, the company may elect 
to pay the equivalent amount in equal monthly instalments, such 
instalments to be reduced by 50% of one-twelfth of the basic salary 
in excess of £20,000 that Mr King receives from any alternative 
employment that he takes up during the notice period.
The service contract of The Hon C W Cayzer is also subject to a 
provision whereby, in the event of a payment in lieu of notice or 
payment of a liquidated sum on termination, he would be entitled  
to an increase in his pensionable service equivalent to the unexpired 
period of notice under his contract.
The Chairman and the non-executive directors do not have service 
contracts, but are appointed under letters of appointment which 
provide for termination without notice or compensation.
Executive directors’ service contracts and the Chairman’s and 
non-executive directors’ letters of appointment are available  
for inspection at the registered office of the company.
The directors’ remuneration report was approved by the board  
on 25 May 2011 and signed on its behalf by:

Financial statements
We have audited the financial statements of Caledonia Investments 
plc for the year ended 31 March 2011 which comprise the group and

of cash flows, and the related notes 1 to 33. The financial reporting 
framework that has been applied in their preparation is applicable 
law and International Financial Reporting Standards (‘IFRSs’) as 
adopted by the European Union.
This report is made solely to the company’s members, as a body, in 
accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies Act 2006.  
Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might state to the 
company’s members those matters we are required to state to them

permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility to 
anyone other than the company and the company’s members as a 
body, for our audit work, for this report, or for the opinions we have 
formed.
Respective responsibilities of directors and auditors
As explained more fully in the statement of directors’ responsibilities, 
the directors are responsible for the preparation of the financial 
statements and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view. 
Our responsibility is to audit and express an opinion on the financial 
statements in accordance with applicable law and International 
Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland). Those standards require  
us to comply with the Auditing Practices Board’s Ethical Standards 
for Auditors.
Scope of the audit of the financial statements
An audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts and 
disclosures in the financial statements sufficient to give reasonable 
assurance that the financial statements are free from material 
misstatement, whether caused by fraud or error. This includes an 
assessment of: whether the accounting policies are appropriate to  
the group’s and the parent company’s circumstances and have been 
consistently applied and adequately disclosed; the reasonableness  
of significant accounting estimates made by the directors; and the 
overall presentation of the financial statements.
In addition, we read all the financial and non-financial information  
in the annual report to identify material inconsistencies with the 
audited financial statements. If we became aware of any apparent 
material misstatements or inconsistencies we consider the 
implications for our report.
Opinion on financial statements
In our opinion:
● ● the financial statements give a true and fair view of the state of the 
group’s and of the parent company’s affairs as at 31 March 2011 
and of the group’s and the parent company’s profit for the year  
then ended;
● ● the financial statements have been properly prepared in 
accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the European Union; and
● ● the financial statements have been prepared in accordance with 
the requirements of the Companies Act 2006 and, as regards the 
group financial statements, Article 4 of the IAS Regulation.
Opinion on other matters prescribed by the Companies Act 2006
In our opinion:
● ● the parts of the directors’ remuneration report to be audited has 
been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 
2006; and
● ● the information given in the directors’ report for the financial year 
for which the financial statements are prepared is consistent with 
the financial statements.
Matters on which we are required to report by exception
We have nothing to report in respect of the following:
Under the Companies Act 2006, we are required to report to you if,  
in our opinion:
● ● adequate accounting records have not been kept by the parent 
company, or returns adequate for our audit have not been received 
from branches not visited by us; or
● ● the parent company financial statements and the part of the 
directors’ remuneration report to be audited are not in agreement 
with the accounting records and returns; or
● ● certain disclosures of directors’ remuneration specified by law are 
not made; or
● ● we have not received all the information and explanations we 
require for our audit.
Under the Listing Rules we are required to review:
● ● the directors’ statement contained within the directors’ report in 
relation to going concern;
● ● the part of the corporate governance report relating to the 
company’s compliance with the nine provisions of the June 2008 
Combined Code specified for our review; and
● ● certain elements of the report to shareholders by the board on 
directors’ remuneration.

Overview Business review Governance Financial statements Other information
General information
Caledonia Investments plc is an investment trust company domiciled 
in the United Kingdom and incorporated in England in 1928, under 
the Companies Acts 1908 to 1917. The address of its registered  
office is Cayzer House, 30 Buckingham Gate, London SW1E 6NN.  
The ordinary shares of the company are listed on the London Stock 
Exchange and the New Zealand Exchange.
These financial statements were authorised for issue by the directors 
on 25 May 2011.
These financial statements are presented in pounds sterling because 
that is the currency of the primary economic environment in which 
Caledonia operates.
In the current year, the group has adopted:
● ● IFRIC 17 ‘Distributions of Non-cash Assets to Owners’, providing 
guidance on accounting for such transactions.
● ● IFRIC 18 ‘Transfers of Assets from Customers’, providing guidance 
on accounting for such transactions.
The adoption of these Interpretations had no impact on these 
financial statements.
At the date of authorisation of these financial statements, the 
following Standard and Interpretation, which have not been applied 
in these financial statements, were in issue but not yet effective:
● ● IFRS 9 ‘Financial Instruments: Classification and Measurement’
● ● IFRIC 19 ‘Extinguishing Financial Liabilities with  
Equity Instruments’.
The directors anticipate that the adoption of the Standard and 
Interpretation in future periods will have no material impact  
on the financial statements of the company.
Significant accounting policies
Basis of accounting
These financial statements have been prepared in accordance with 
International Financial Reporting Standards (‘IFRSs’) as adopted for 
use in the EU and therefore the group financial statements comply 
with Article 4 of the EU IAS Regulation. IFRSs comprise accounting 
standards issued by the International Accounting Standards Board 
and its predecessor body as well as interpretations issued by the 
International Financial Reporting Interpretations Committee and  
its predecessor body.
Caledonia is an investment trust company. However, because it  
holds majority stakes and therefore has the power to control, it is 
required to prepare group accounts that consolidate the results  
of such investments. In order to present information that is 
comparable with other investment trust companies, Caledonia  
also publishes financial statements of the company, which include 
investments in subsidiaries regarded as part of the company’s 
investing business at fair value.
The financial statements have been prepared on an historical cost 
basis, except for the revaluation of certain financial instruments  
and properties. Where presentational guidance set out in the 
Statement of Recommended Practice: Financial Statements of 
Investment Trust Companies and Venture Capital Trusts (‘SORP’)  
issued by the Association of Investment Companies in January 2009 
is consistent with the requirements of IFRSs as adopted by the 
European Union, the directors have sought to prepare the financial 
statements on a basis compliant with the recommendations of  
the SORP. The recommendations of the SORP have been applied  
to the company, but not to the group, financial statements, as the 
directors believe that it would be misleading to present a three 
column income statement for the group. 2011 is the first year in 
which the presentational guidance in the SORP has been adopted.
Under the Combined Code and applicable regulations, the directors 
are required to satisfy themselves that it is reasonable to presume 
that the company is a going concern. The directors have a reasonable 
expectation that the company and the group have adequate  
resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable 
future, as discussed in the directors’ report on page 26. Accordingly,  
they continue to adopt the going concern basis of preparing the 
financial statements.
The principal accounting policies are set out below.
Foreign currency translation
Transactions in foreign currencies are recorded at the rate of 
exchange ruling at the date of the transaction. Monetary assets and 
liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at the reporting date  
are translated to the functional currency at the foreign exchange rate 
ruling at the reporting date. Foreign exchange differences arising  
on translation are recognised in the statement of comprehensive 
income. Non-monetary assets and liabilities that are measured in 
terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are translated to the 
functional currency using the exchange rate at the date of the 
transaction. Non-monetary assets and liabilities denominated  
in foreign currencies that are stated at fair value are translated  
to the functional currency at foreign exchange rates ruling at the 
dates the fair values were determined.
In the company financial statements, foreign exchange gains or losses 
are recognised in capital or revenue reserve depending on whether 
the gain or loss is of a capital or revenue nature respectively.
Assets and liabilities of the group’s overseas operations are measured 
using their functional currency, being the currency of the primary 
economic environment in which they operate.
On consolidation, the assets and liabilities of the group’s overseas 
operations are translated at exchange rates prevailing on the 
reporting date. Income and expense items are translated at the 
average exchange rates for the period unless exchange rates fluctuate 
significantly. Exchange differences arising, if any, are classified as 
equity and transferred to the group’s foreign exchange translation 
reserve. Such exchange differences are recognised in the statement  
of comprehensive income in the period in which the operation is sold.
Goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on the acquisition  
of a foreign entity are treated as assets and liabilities of the foreign 
entity and translated at the closing rate at the reporting date.
Investments
Investments are recognised and derecognised on a trade date where 
a purchase or sale of an investment is under a contract whose terms 
require delivery of the investment within the timeframe established 
by the market concerned, and are initially measured at cost, 
excluding transaction costs.
Investments held as part of the group’s business of investing in 
financial assets are designated as measured at fair value through 
profit or loss in both the consolidated financial statements and  
the company financial statements. Other investments held by 
subsidiaries are designated as available for sale in the consolidated 
financial statements. Other investments in subsidiaries held by  
the company are accounted for at cost in the financial statements  
of the company.
Investments designated as held at fair value through profit or loss  
or as available for sale are measured at subsequent reporting dates  
at fair value. Gains and losses arising from changes in the value of 
investments designated as held at fair value through profit or loss, 
including foreign exchange movements, are included in net profit  
or loss for the period as a capital return. For available for sale 
investments, gains and losses arising from changes in fair value  
are recognised in other comprehensive income until the investment 
is disposed of or is determined to be impaired, at which time  
the cumulative gain or loss previously recognised in other 
comprehensive income is included in the net profit or loss for the 
period. If, in the subsequent period, the fair value of the available for 
sale investments, for which impairment was previously recognised, 
increases in value, the impairment loss is reversed through the 
statement of comprehensive income.
Accounting policies Financial statements 46 Caledonia Investments plc Annual report 2011
Listed investments are valued at bid price or the last traded  
price when a bid price is not available. Unlisted investments are 
valued using recognised valuation methodologies, based on the 
International Private Equity and Venture Capital Guidelines,  
which reflect the amount for which an asset could be exchanged 
between knowledgeable, willing parties on an arm’s length basis.  
The portfolio valuation methodology is detailed on page 21.
Distributions from investment limited partnerships are treated as 
disposal proceeds or income in accordance with the nature of the 
distribution. Any surplus capital distributions after repaying any 
partner’s loans and capital are treated as realised gains.
Income
Dividends receivable on equity shares are recognised as revenue 
when the shareholders’ right to receive payment has been 
established, normally the ex-dividend date. Where no ex-dividend 
date is available, dividends receivable on or before the period end  
are treated as revenue for the period. Provision is made for any 
dividends not expected to be received.
The fixed returns on debt securities, loans and non-equity  
shares are recognised on an effective interest rate basis, which  
is the rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash receipts 
through the expected life of the financial asset to that asset’s net 
carrying amount.
For trading subsidiaries, revenue comprises the fair value of the sale 
of goods and services, net of value added tax, rebates and discounts 
and after eliminating sales within the group. Sales of goods are 
recognised when goods are delivered and title has passed. Sales  
of services are recognised in the accounting period in which the 
services are rendered, by reference to completion of the specific 
transaction, assessed on the basis of the actual service provided  
as a proportion of the total services to be provided.
The company’s share of net income from limited partnerships is 
recognised as revenue when received.
Where uncertainty arises over the collectability of an amount  
already included in income, the uncollectible amount or the amount 
in respect of which the recovery has ceased to be probable, is 
recognised as an expense. When the uncertainty over collectability  
is removed, normally on receipt, the income is recognised in the 
statement of comprehensive income.
Expenses
All expenses are accounted for on an accrual basis. In the company 
financial statements, management expenses and performance fees 
are included in revenue reserves. Expenses of acquisition of an 
investment designated as held at fair value through profit or loss or 
expenses of an aborted acquisition or disposal of an investment are 
presented as transaction costs or deducted from the proceeds of  
sale as appropriate and included in capital reserves. 
Taxation
The tax expense represents the sum of the tax currently payable  
and deferred tax.
The tax currently payable is based on the taxable profit for the 
period. Taxable profit differs from net profit as reported in the 
statement of comprehensive income because it excludes items of 
income or expense that are taxable or deductible in other periods  
and it further excludes items that are never taxable or deductible.  
The group’s liability for current tax is calculated using tax rates  
that were applicable at the reporting date.
Deferred tax is the tax expected to be payable or recoverable on 
differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in 
the financial statements and the corresponding tax bases used in the 
computation of taxable profit, and is accounted for using the liability 
method. Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for all taxable 
temporary differences and deferred tax assets are recognised to the 
extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available against 
which deductible temporary differences can be utilised. Investment 
trust companies that have approval as such under section 1158 of  
the Corporation Tax Act 2010 (formerly section 842 of the Income 
and Corporation Taxes Act 1988) are not liable for taxation on  
capital gains.
The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each 
reporting date and adjusted to the extent that it is probable that 
sufficient taxable profits will be available to allow all or part of  
the assets to be recovered.
Dividend distribution
Dividends are recognised in the period in which they are 
appropriately authorised and no longer at the discretion of the  
entity. For interim dividends, this will normally mean the date  
on which they are paid and, for final dividends, the date on which 
they are approved in general meeting.
Employee benefits
Pension schemes
Payments to defined contribution schemes are charged as an expense 
as they fall due.
For defined benefit schemes, the cost of providing benefits is 
determined using the projected unit credit method, with actuarial 
valuations being carried out at each reporting date. Actuarial gains 
and losses are recognised in full in the period in which they occur. 
They are recognised in other comprehensive income and presented 
in the statement of comprehensive income.
Past service cost is recognised immediately to the extent that  
the benefits are already vested and otherwise is amortised on  
a straight-line basis over the average period until the benefits 
become vested.
The retirement benefit obligation recognised in the statement of 
financial position represents the present value of the defined benefit 
obligation as adjusted for unrecognised past service cost and as 
reduced by the fair value of scheme assets. Any asset resulting  
from this calculation is limited to past service cost, plus the present 
value of available refunds and reductions in future contributions  
to the plan.
Profit-sharing and bonus plans
The group recognises a liability and an expense for bonuses and 
profit-sharing, based on a formula that takes into consideration  
the profit attributable to the company’s shareholders after certain 
adjustments. The group recognises a provision where contractually 
obliged or where there is a past practice that has created a 
constructive obligation.
Share-based payments
The group issues equity-settled share-based payments to certain 
employees. Equity-settled share-based payments are measured at 
fair value at the date of grant and the fair value is expensed on a 
straight-line basis over the vesting period, based on the group’s 
estimate of shares that will eventually vest.
Where employees of a subsidiary are granted rights to the equity 
instruments of its parent as consideration for the services provided 
to the subsidiary, the subsidiary recognises an equity settled 
share-based payment transaction expense with a corresponding 
increase recognised in equity representing a contribution from  
the parent.
An employee share trust is used for distributing option shares  
and deferred bonus awards to employees under Caledonia’s share 
remuneration schemes. The trustee purchases shares with money 
lent interest free by Caledonia and transfers shares to participating 
employees on receipt of the requisite consideration or calling  
of awards.
The transactions the employee share trust undertakes are 
considered to be performed by the trust as an agent for Caledonia. 
The transactions of the employee share trust are included in the 
separate financial statements of the parent company and, following

Financial statements
On disposal of a subsidiary, associate or jointly controlled entity, the 
attributable amount of goodwill is included in the determination of 
the profit or loss on disposal.
Impairment of assets
At each reporting date, the group reviews the carrying amounts of its 
tangible and intangible assets to determine whether there is any 
indication that those assets have suffered an impairment loss. If any 
such indication exists, an impairment loss is recognised for the amount 
by which the asset’s carrying amount exceeds its recoverable amount, 
if any. The recoverable amount is the higher of an asset’s fair value less 
costs to sell and value in use. For the purposes of assessing impairment, 
intangible assets are grouped at the lowest levels for which there are 
separately identifiable cash flows (cash-generating units).
Inventories
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value. 
Cost comprises direct materials and, where applicable, direct labour 
costs and those overheads that have been incurred in bringing the 
inventories to their present location and condition. Cost is calculated 
using the first-in, first-out method. Net realisable value represents 
the estimated selling price less all estimated costs of completion and 
costs to be incurred in marketing, selling and distribution.
Properties that are held for sale in the ordinary course of business  
or are being developed for future sale are classified as inventories.
Receivables
Receivables do not carry any interest and are stated at their nominal 
value as reduced by appropriate allowances for estimated 
irrecoverable amounts.
Cash and cash equivalents
Cash comprises cash on hand and demand deposits. Cash equivalents 
are short term, highly liquid investments that are readily convertible 
to known amounts of cash and that are subject to an insignificant risk 
of changes in value.
Borrowings
Interest-bearing bank loans and overdrafts are recorded at the 
proceeds received, net of direct issue costs. Finance charges, 
including premiums payable on settlement or redemption and direct 
issue costs, are accounted for on an accrual basis in the statement of 
comprehensive income using the effective interest method and are 
added to the carrying amount of the instrument to the extent that 
they are not settled in the period in which they arise. The effective 
interest method allocates the interest expense over the life of the 
instrument so as to reflect a constant return on the carrying amount 
of the liability.
Borrowings include a component of the company’s deferred ordinary 
shares and preference shares in subsidiaries held by third parties 
that fall under the definition of financial liabilities under IAS 32.
Provisions
A provision is recognised in the statement of financial position when 
the company has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result 
of a past event, and it is probable that an outflow of economic benefits 
will be required to settle the obligation. Provisions are measured at 
the directors’ best estimate of the expenditure required to settle the 
obligation at the reporting date and are discounted to present value 
where the effect is material.
In the company financial statements, provisions recognised for 
investments are recognised in the statement of comprehensive 
income as a capital return.
Leasing
Leases are classified as finance leases whenever the terms of the 
lease transfer substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership  
to the lessee. All other leases are classified as operating leases.
the requirements of SIC 12, in the consolidated financial statements 
as if they arose in that company. Own shares held by the employee 
share trust as at the reporting date are accounted for as if they were 
treasury shares.
National insurance on share option scheme gains and deferred  
bonus awards
National insurance payable on the exercise of certain employee share 
options at the date of exercise and deferred bonus awards at the date 
of call have been charged as an expense spread over the respective 
vesting periods. The charge is based on the difference between the 
market value of the underlying shares at the reporting date and the 
exercise price for share options or £nil for deferred bonus awards 
and calculated at the latest enacted national insurance rate.
Capital reserve
The company maintains a capital reserve, which it is prohibited from 
distributing by virtue of its articles of association. The following 
items are transferred into the capital reserve from profit or loss:
● ● gains and losses on investments held at fair value through profit  
or loss
● ● gains and losses on derivatives used to hedge the fair value  
of investments
● ● expenses and finance costs incurred directly in relation to  
capital transactions
● ● taxation on items recognised in the capital reserve.
Property, plant and equipment
Property, plant and equipment is stated at cost less accumulated 
depreciation and any recognised impairment loss.
Depreciation is charged so as to write off the cost of assets, other 
than land or properties under construction, over their estimated 
useful lives, using the straight-line method, on the following bases:
Property  25-40 years 
Plant  10-15 years 
Equipment 3-8 years
Assets held under finance leases are depreciated over their expected 
useful lives on the same basis as owned assets or, where shorter, over 
the term of the relevant lease.
The gain or loss on the disposal or retirement of an asset is 
determined as the difference between the sales proceeds and the 
carrying amount of the asset and is recognised in the statement of 
comprehensive income.
Investment property
Investment property, which is property held to earn rentals and/or 
for capital appreciation, is stated at its fair value at the reporting 
date. Gains and losses arising from changes in the fair value of 
investment property are included in the statement of comprehensive 
income for the period in which they arise.
Intangible assets
Brands, trademarks, computer software and customer relationships
Brands, trademarks, computer software and customer  
relationships acquired by the group are stated at cost less 
accumulated amortisation and impairment losses. Where such  
items are not deemed to have an indefinite life, amortisation is 
expensed on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives.
Goodwill
Goodwill arising on consolidation represents the excess of the  
cost of acquisition over the group’s interest in the fair value of the 
identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities of a subsidiary, 
associate or jointly controlled entity at the date of acquisition.
Goodwill is recognised as an asset and reviewed for impairment at 
least annually. Any impairment is recognised immediately in profit  
or loss and is not subsequently reversed. Financial statements 48 Caledonia Investments plc Annual report 2011
Accounting policies
continued
The results of subsidiaries acquired or disposed of during the period 
are included in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income 
from the effective date of acquisition or up to the effective date of 
disposal, as appropriate.
Where necessary, adjustments are made to the financial statements 
of subsidiaries to bring the accounting policies used in line with those 
used by the group.
All intra-group transactions, balances, income and expenses are 
eliminated on consolidation.
Associates
An associate is an entity over which the group is in a position to 
exercise significant influence, but not control or joint control, through 
the financial and operating policy decisions of the investee entity.
As Caledonia is an investment trust company, and its investments 
held in associates are designated as held at fair value through profit 
or loss, the provisions of IAS 28 ‘Investments in Associates’ do not 
apply. Such investments are measured at fair value, with changes  
in fair value recognised in profit or loss in the period in which  
they occur.
No other group company held investments in associates.
Joint ventures
A joint venture is a contractual arrangement whereby two or  
more parties undertake an economic activity that is the subject  
of joint control.
As Caledonia is an investment trust company, and its interests in joint 
ventures are designated as held at fair value through profit or loss, 
the provisions of IAS 31 ‘Interests in Joint Ventures’ do not apply. 
Such interests are measured at fair value, with changes in fair  
value recognised in profit or loss in the period in which they occur. 
However, the provisions of IAS 31 do apply to interests in joint 
ventures held by other companies in the group, as set out below.
The results and assets and liabilities of joint ventures held by 
subsidiaries are incorporated in these financial statements using the 
equity method of accounting, except when classified as held for sale. 
Interests in joint ventures are carried in the statement of financial 
position at cost as adjusted by post-acquisition changes in the group’s 
share of net assets of the joint ventures, less any impairment in the 
value of individual investments. Losses of the joint ventures in excess 
of the group’s interest in those joint ventures are not recognised.
Any excess of the cost of acquisition over the group’s share of the fair 
values of the identifiable net assets of the joint ventures at the date  
of acquisition is recognised as goodwill. Any deficiency in the cost  
of acquisition below the group’s share of the fair values of the 
identifiable net assets at the date of acquisition is credited in profit  
or loss in the period of acquisition.
Where a group company transacts with joint ventures of the group, 
profits and losses are eliminated to the extent of the group’s interest 
in the relevant joint ventures. Losses may provide evidence of an 
impairment of the asset transferred, in which case appropriate 
provision is made for impairment.
Lessor
Rental income from operating leases is recognised on a straight-line 
basis over the term of the relevant lease. Initial direct costs incurred 
in negotiating and arranging an operating lease are added to the 
carrying amount of the leased asset and recognised on a  
straight-line basis.
Lessee
Assets held under finance leases are recognised as assets of the 
group at their fair value or, if lower, at the present value of the 
minimum lease payments, each determined at the inception of the 
lease. The corresponding liability to the lessor is included in the 
statement of financial position as a finance lease obligation. Lease 
payments are apportioned between finance charges and reduction  
of the lease obligation so as to achieve a constant rate of interest on 
the remaining balance of the liability. Finance charges are charged 
directly against income.
Rentals payable under operating leases are charged to income  
on a straight-line basis over the term of the relevant lease.
Benefits received and receivable as an incentive to enter into an 
operating lease are also spread on a straight-line basis over the  
lease term.
Share capital
Equity instruments issued by the company are recorded as the 
proceeds received, net of direct issue costs.
Where any group company and the Caledonia Investments plc 
Employee Share Trust purchases the company’s equity share capital 
or the company buys shares into treasury, the consideration paid, 
including any directly attributable incremental costs (net of income 
taxes), is deducted from equity attributable to the company’s owners 
until the shares are cancelled or transferred. Where such shares  
are subsequently transferred, any consideration received, net of  
any directly attributable incremental transaction costs and the 
related income tax effects, is included in equity attributable to the 
company’s owners.
Derivative financial instruments and hedge accounting
Derivatives are recognised at fair value on the date a contract is 
entered into and are subsequently re-measured at their fair value.
Hedge accounting is not applied. Changes in the fair value of 
derivative financial instruments are recognised in the statement  
of comprehensive income as they arise.
Operating segments
Operating segments are based on the financial information reported 
to the chief operating decision maker.
Basis of consolidation
Subsidiaries
The consolidated financial statements include the financial 
statements of the company and entities controlled by the company 
(its subsidiaries) made up to the reporting date. Control is achieved 
where the company has the power to govern the financial and 
operating policies of the investee entity so as to obtain economic 
benefits from its activities.
On acquisition, the identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent 
liabilities of a subsidiary are measured at fair values at the date of 
acquisition. Any excess of the cost of acquisition over the fair values 
of the identifiable net assets acquired is recognised as goodwill.  
Any deficiency in the cost of acquisition below the fair values of  
the identifiable net assets acquired (i.e. discount on acquisition)  
is credited to the statement of comprehensive income in the period  
of acquisition. The interest of non-controlling shareholders is stated 
at the non-controlled proportion of the fair values of the assets and 
liabilities recognised.  Caledonia Investments plc Annual report 2011 49

7. Earnings and net asset value per share
Basic and diluted earnings per share
The calculation of basic earnings per share of the company and of  
the group was based on the profit attributable to shareholders and 
the weighted average number of shares outstanding during the year.  
The calculation of diluted earnings per share included an adjustment 
for the effects of dilutive potential shares.
The company earnings per share figure can be further analysed 
between revenue and capital, as follows:

Net asset value per share
The company’s undiluted net asset value per share is based on the  
net assets of the company at the year end and on the number of 
shares in issue at the year end less shares held by the Caledonia 
Investments plc Employee Share Trust, restricted shares, shares  
held by a subsidiary and shares accounted as held in treasury. The 
company’s diluted net asset value per share assumes the re-issue of 
shares accounted as held in treasury at the closing mid-market price 
on the reporting date, the exercise of all outstanding in-the-money 
share options and the calling of deferred bonus awards.

Customer relationships primarily related to identifiable customer 
related intangible assets acquired on the purchase of the Ermitage 
group in 2007. During the year, the useful economic life of client 
relationships was revised down, from ten to five years.
Other intangible assets included brands and trademarks, recipes  
and formulae and computer software.
Impairment charge
The impairment charge for the year of £14.9m (2010 – £1.9m)  
was recognised in operating expenses of trading operations in  
the statement of comprehensive income.
Impairment tests for goodwill
The carrying amount of goodwill was predominantly attributable  
to a single cash generating unit, Ermitage group. The recoverable 
amount of the unit has been determined on the basis of the fair  
value less costs to sell based on recent forecasts from the unit 
management’s business plan and comparable market transactions.

The options outstanding at 31 March 2011 have an exercise price in 
the range of 782.5p to 1878p and a weighted average contractual life 
of ten years.
The fair value of services received in return for share options granted 
were measured indirectly, by reference to the fair value of share 
options granted. The estimate of the fair value of the services 
received was measured based on the Hull-White Employee Stock 
Option Valuation lattice model. This takes account of the impact of 
future events, such as early exercise by employees and employee exit 
rates after vesting. Also, the Hull-White model defines the conditions 
under which employees are expected to exercise their options after 
vesting in terms of the share price reaching a certain multiple of the 
exercise price.
Mortality rates are assumed to follow the Self Administered Pension 
Schemes ‘Series 1’ light tables applicable to each member’s year  
of birth, projected to calendar year 2009 in line with medium  
cohort improvements. Allowance has also been made for further 
improvements in line with medium cohort improvement rates with  
a minimum improvement of 1.5% pa. Life expectancy on retirement 
in normal heath is assumed to be 26.5 years for males and 28.0 years 
for females who are currently 62 years of age.
Expected contributions to group post-employment benefit plans for 
the year ended 31 March 2011 were £3.0m (2010 – £2.4m).

The company currently has two executive share option schemes,  
a 1998 scheme and a 2005 scheme. These schemes entitle senior 
employees to purchase shares in the company at the market price  
of the shares at the date of grant and on similar terms, subject to 
service and company performance criteria. Under the terms of the 
schemes, options may be exercised between three and ten years  
after the date of grant, although only one-third of the options may  
be exercised after three years from grant, with the remaining 
two-thirds becoming exercisable six years after grant. A number  
of grants have been made under these schemes.
The company also has a deferred bonus plan under which senior 
employees compulsorily defer part of their annual bonus, being any 
bonus in excess of 50% of their basic salary for the bonus year, into 
shares and may voluntarily defer up to 50% of their remaining cash 
bonus into shares. The company will match the number of shares 
comprised in both compulsory (in respect of bonus for financial years 
ended 31 March 2008 and onwards) and voluntary deferral, subject 
to service and company performance criteria. Caledonia Investments plc Annual report 2011 57

Financial statements
During the year, the company recognised a £10.0m investment 
provision relating to a bank guarantee provided for subsidiary 
borrowings. In the prior year, a £5.4m investment provision related  
to a solvency guarantee given to a subsidiary was recognised.  
The solvency guarantee was related to the disposal of investments 
and was recognised in the statement of comprehensive income.  
Investment provisions have been allocated to the capital reserve. 
Other provisions in the group related to warranty claims. Provisions  
are based on an estimate of the expenditure to be incurred as  
a result of past events. The matters that gave rise to the provisions  
were expected to be resolved over the next year.
21. Financial instruments
Financial instruments comprise securities and other investments, 
cash balances, borrowings and receivables and payables that arise 
from operations. The investment portfolio includes listed and 
unlisted equity investments, debt instruments and investments  
in funds that are intended to be held for the long term.
Risk analysis
The main types of financial risk to which the group is exposed are 
market risk, credit risk and liquidity risk. 
The nature and extent of the financial instruments outstanding at  
the reporting date and the risk management policies employed are 
discussed below.
Market risk
Market risk embodies the potential for both losses and gains and 
includes price risk, currency risk, fair value interest rate risk.
The strategy for managing market risk is driven by the investment 
objective, which is to outperform the FTSE All-Share Total Return 
index over five and ten years and to achieve a positive total return 
over rolling five year periods. Investments are made in a range of 
instruments, including listed and unlisted equities, debt and 
non-equity investment funds, in a range of sectors and regions.
The board monitors the investment exposure against guidelines  
set from time to time by the board, specifying the maximum 
proportion of total assets that may be invested in sectors, regions 
and currencies. The board also reviews the position, prospects and 
exit strategy for all substantial investments at least once a year.
Details of the investment portfolio at the reporting date are shown  
on pages 8 to 16.
Price risk
Price risk may affect the value of listed and unlisted investments as  
a result of changes in market prices (other than arising from interest 
rate risk or currency risk), whether caused by factors specific to an 
individual investment, its issuer or factors affecting all instruments 
traded in the market.
As the majority of financial instruments are carried at fair value, 
with fair value changes recognised in the statement of comprehensive 
income, all changes in market conditions will directly affect reported 
portfolio returns.
Price risk is managed by constructing a diversified portfolio  
of instruments traded on various markets and hedging  
where appropriate.
The exposures of listed and unlisted equity investments, equity 
linked bonds, funds and options on indices to price risk were  
as follows:

Investments held at fair value 
through profit or loss 1,126.6 1,122.9 1,041.4 1,042.2 
The weighted average fair value at the measurement date of share 
options granted during the year and parameters used to derive the 
fair value, were as follows:
Senior staff 
2011 2010 
Fair value at measurement date 468p 392p 
Share price 1547p 1446p 
Exercise price 1547p 1446p 
Expected volatility 36.6% 32.2% 
Exercise multiple 2.0 2.0 
Expected dividends 2.7% 2.9% 
Risk-free interest rate  
(based on UK Government bonds) 3.0% 3.2% 
The expected volatility is based on the historic volatility, calculated 
as the average volatility over a period equal to the expected life of the 
share options.
Share options are granted under a service condition and non-market 
performance conditions. Such conditions are not taken into account in 
the grant date fair value measurement of the services received. There 
are no market conditions associated with the share option grants.
The fair value of services received in return for deferred share 
awards were measured directly, by reference to the fair value of 
services received during the period. This was based on the amount  
of annual bonus that was compulsorily and voluntarily deferred in 
accordance with the rules of the company’s deferred bonus plan.
Employee expenses/(credits) were as follows:

The sensitivity analysis below has been determined based on the 
exposure to interest rates at the reporting date for a 50 basis point 
change taking place at the beginning of the financial year and held 
constant throughout the year. This level of change is considered to  
be reasonable, based on observation of market conditions and 
historic trends.

Increase in interest rates (1.4) (1.5) (0.8) (1.0)
The sensitivity to interest rates has increased in the year due to 
increased cash and cash equivalents balances.
Credit risk
Credit risk is the risk that the counterparty to a financial instrument 
will fail to discharge an obligation or commitment. A credit policy is 
in place and exposure to credit risk is regularly monitored.
At 31 March 2011, the financial assets exposed to credit risk were  
as follows:

Cash and cash equivalents 101.2 8.3 121.5 30.5 
167.9 110.1 210.4 161.5 
Prior to making investments in debt instruments, management has  
in place a process of review that includes an evaluation of a potential 
investee company’s ability to service and repay its debt. Management 
reviews the financial position of investee companies, including their 
continuing ability to service and repay debt, on a regular basis.
The exposure to credit risk on operating and other receivables is 
mitigated by performing credit evaluations on investee companies  
as part of the due diligence process.
Credit risk arising on money market funds and cash and cash 
equivalents is mitigated by spreading investments and deposits 
across a number of investment grade banks with a credit rating  
of ‘AA3’ or ‘AA- ’ or better as determined by the ratings agencies, 
Moody’s and Fitch. The company receives a monthly rating update, 
and relevant credit risks are reviewed accordingly.
The following table details the sensitivity to a 10% variation in 
equity prices. The sensitivity analysis includes all equity and fund 
investments held at fair value through profit or loss and adjusts  
their valuation at the year end for a 10% change in value. The 
valuation movement is aggregated with the expected movement  
in the valuation of the options on indices to provide a net increase  
or decrease in profit or loss.

Increase in prices 112.7 112.3 104.1 104.2 
Decrease in prices (112.7) (112.3) (104.1) (104.2)
The sensitivity to equity and fund investments has increased during 
the year due to the market movement in the year.
In management’s opinion, the sensitivity analysis is unrepresentative 
of the inherent price risk as the year end exposure does not reflect 
the exposure throughout the year as a whole.
Currency risk
Investments in financial instruments and other transactions may  
be denominated in currencies other than the functional currency. 
Consequently, there is exposure to the risk that the exchange rate  
of the functional currency may change relative to other currencies  
in a manner that has an adverse effect on the value of that portion  
of assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the 
functional currency.
The company’s non-functional currency denominated investments 
and gains/losses thereon are reviewed regularly by the directors and 
the currency risk is managed within parameters set by the directors 
on asset allocation, strategies and risk. At 31 March 2011, the 
company and group had a euro forward currency contract hedging 
a euro denominated investment.
The fair values of the monetary items that have foreign currency 
exposure were as follows:

The exposure to foreign currency has reduced during the year due  
to the reduction in foreign trade and other receivable balances and 
increase in foreign trade and other payables.
Interest rate risk
Interest rate movements may affect the fair value of investments in 
fixed interest securities and the level of income receivable from fixed 
income securities and cash at bank and on deposit.
The company and group held fixed rate, interest-bearing financial 
assets, with maturity of up to five years, cash at bank and on term 
deposits, with the term to maturity of up to three months, and 
floating rate, interest-bearing financial assets. The group also  
had floating rate, interest-bearing borrowings. Caledonia Investments plc Annual report 2011 59

Financial statements
The board monitors and reviews the broad structure of the 
company’s capital on an ongoing basis. This review includes:
● ● the planned level of gearing, which takes into account planned 
investment activity
● ● the possible buy back of equity shares for holding in treasury or 
cancellation, which takes account of the discount of the share price 
to net asset value per share
● ● the annual dividend policy.
The company’s objectives, policies and processes for managing 
capital are unchanged from the preceding year.
The company is subject to the following externally imposed capital 
requirements:
● ● as a public company, the company is required to have a minimum 
issued share capital of £50,000
● ● to maintain its approval as an investment trust company, the 
company is required to comply with the provisions of section 1159 
of the Corporation Tax Act 2010.
The company has complied with these requirements, which are 
unchanged since the previous year end.
Fair value hierarchy
The company’s valuation methodology is disclosed on page 21.  
The table below analyses financial instruments held at fair value 
according to the subjectivity of the valuation method, according  
to the following hierarchy:
Level 1  Quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for  
identical assets.
Level 2  Inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1  
that are directly or indirectly observable.
Level 3  Inputs for the asset that are not based on observable 
market data.

All transactions in listed securities are settled on contract terms 
using approved brokers. The risk of default is considered minimal, as 
delivery of securities sold is only made once the broker has received 
payment. Payment is made on a purchase once the securities have 
been received by the broker. The trade will fail if either party fails  
to meet their obligations. UK listed security trades are settled 
through CREST.
There were no significant concentrations of credit risk to 
counterparties at 31 March 2011 (2010 – £nil).
Fair value
Most of the financial instruments are carried at fair value in the 
statement of financial position. Usually, the fair value of the financial 
instruments can be reliably determined within a reasonable range  
of estimates. For certain other financial instruments, specifically 
operating and other receivables and payables, the carrying amounts 
approximate fair value due to the immediate or short term nature  
of these financial instruments.
The principal methods and assumptions used in estimating the fair 
value of investments are disclosed on page 21.
Liquidity risk
Liquidity risk arises as a result of the possibility that the company 
may not be able to meet its obligations as they fall due.
The corporate treasury function provides services to the company 
and group, coordinating access to domestic financial markets for 
both borrowing and depositing. Group companies access local 
financial markets when this is more favourable, in liaison with the 
corporate treasury function. Executive management monitors the 
group’s liquidity on a weekly basis.

The company has also issued share options and made deferred bonus 
awards (note 19).
As at 31 March 2011, the issued share capital of the company 
comprised 58,794,781 ordinary shares (2010 – 58,794,781) and 
8,000,000 deferred ordinary shares (2010 – 8,000,000). The ordinary 
and deferred ordinary shares have a nominal value of 5p.
The holders of the ordinary shares are entitled to receive dividends 
as declared from time to time and are entitled to one vote per share 
at meetings of the company. In respect of the company’s ordinary 
shares that are held by the group, all voting rights are suspended.
The deferred ordinary shares carry no voting rights and are not 
redeemable. They carry the right to a fixed cumulative preference 
dividend of 1% per annum (exclusive of any associated tax credit) of 
the nominal value of such deferred ordinary shares, being 0.05p per 
share, or £4,000 in aggregate, for all such shares currently in issue. 
The company is required to pay the dividend to the extent that it  
has distributable profits. On a winding-up or other return of capital,  
the deferred ordinary shares carry the right to the payment of the 
amount paid up on such shares only after holders of the ordinary 
shares have received the sum of £100,000 in respect of each such 
ordinary share. All of the deferred ordinary shares are held by 
Sterling Industries PLC, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Caledonia.
Capital redemption reserve
The capital redemption reserve comprises the nominal value of  
those shares purchased by the company out of its own profits and 
cancelled. At 31 March 2011, the capital redemption reserve was 
£1.2m (2010 and 2009 – £1.2m). There was no movement in the 
capital redemption reserve in the current or prior years.

30. Operating segments
The chief operating decision maker has been identified as the 
Executive Committee, which reviews the company’s internal 
reporting in order to assess performance and allocate resources. 
Management has determined the operating segments based on  
these reports.
The performance of operating segments is assessed on a measure  
of company total revenue, principally comprising gains and losses  
on investments and derivatives hedging those investments and 
investment income. Reportable profit or loss is after ‘Treasury 
income’ and ‘Other items’, which comprise management and other 
expenses and provisions. Reportable assets equate to the company’s 
net asset value. 
Reportable results and assets view subsidiaries and joint ventures as 
investments held at fair value and include liabilities of the company. 
To reconcile to group profit or loss and total assets ‘Eliminations’ 
comprise the difference between the aggregate fair value and total 
assets of subsidiaries and joint ventures and the company’s liabilities.

33. Accounting estimates and judgements
Key sources of estimation uncertainty 
Fair values of financial instruments
Many of the group’s financial instruments are measured at fair value 
in the statement of financial position and it is usually possible to 
determine their fair values within a reasonable range of estimates.
For the majority of the group’s financial instruments, quoted  
market prices are readily available. However, certain financial 
instruments, such as unlisted securities, are fair valued using 
valuation techniques, including reference to the current fair values  
of instruments that are substantially the same (subject to the 
appropriate adjustments).
Fair value estimates are made at a specific point in time, based on 
market conditions and information about the financial instrument. 
These estimates are subjective in nature and involve uncertainties 
and matters of significant judgement (e.g. interest rates, volatility, 
estimated cash flows, etc) and therefore cannot be determined  
with precision.

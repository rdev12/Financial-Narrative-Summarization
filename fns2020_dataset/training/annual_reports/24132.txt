Performance Highlights
Operational highlights
Financial highlights
• Annual silver production up 7.1%  
in line with guidance, driven by  
the start-up of phase I at San  
Julián, higher ore grades at Fresnillo 
and Ciénega and an increased  
Silverstream contribution.
• Gold production up 22.8% 
exceeding the revised guidance 
primarily due to the reduction  
of gold inventories at Herradura  
and San Julián phase I start-up.
• San Julián phase I commissioned, 
production already exceeding  
design capacity. 
• Gold and silver resources increased 
8.2% and 10.2%, respectively, gold 
reserves remained stable and silver 
reserves decreased 3.2%. 
• Three fatalities in 2016 and one in 
early 2017; renewed focus on safety 
culture throughout the year.

A Strong Growth Pipeline
Our goal is to profitably and sustainably 
maintain the Group’s position as the world’s 
leading silver producer and one of Mexico’s 
largest gold producers.
1. Operations at Soledad-Dipolos are currently suspended. 06
Fresnillo plc Annual Report 2016
Chairman’s Statement
Meeting our commitments
Against this backdrop, we have remained 
firmly committed to creating sustained 
and shared value for all our stakeholders, 
focusing on efficient, competitive 
operations and high potential silver  
and gold projects that can be developed 
into low cost mines able to withstand 
unpredictable metal prices. We have 
invested consistently over the cycle,  
and thus have been able to grow and 
retain a motivated and qualified team.  
Our strategic direction, combined with 
quality assets, operational flexibility and 
efficiency, solid financial position and 
enduring commitment to responsible 
business practices are the pillars of 
long-term value creation.
The year in review
Precious metal prices, while still volatile, 
performed well in 2016 and reversed  
their downward trend spanning several 
years. Our average realised gold and silver 
prices rose 10.7% and 10.3%, respectively, 
over 2015. The Group’s gold and silver 
production increased 22.8% and 7.1%, 
respectively, exceeding its gold production 
target for the year and meeting the target 
for silver.
Better prices and higher volumes led to 
robust financial results. Y our Company 
generated US$2,045.0 million in adjusted 
revenues in 2016, a rise of 29.2% over the 
prior year, with a 505.5% increase in profit 
attributable to shareholders and US$12.6 
million distributed to employees and 
workers in profit sharing. The cash, cash 
equivalents and short-term investments  
at year end were US$912.0 million and  
debt was US$800 million.
continued on page 08
We seek to  
ensure that  
capital allocation 
balances growth, 
shareholder 
returns, financial 
strength and 
flexibility , within 
the context  
of a maturing 
sustainability 
framework. 
Over the course of Fresnillo plc’s eight 
years as a publicly listed company,  
a number of trends have reshaped the  
global mining industry and altered the 
competitive landscape: pressure on 
profitability arising from commodity  
price and currency volatility, rising costs, 
and maturing mines with declining ore 
grades; lower rates of return on capital 
projects concurrent with increased 
shareholder appetite for returns; rising 
social and environmental awareness; and 
governmental initiatives to regulate and 
derive additional revenue from the sector, 
among others. 07

Embedding best practices
Our Code of Conduct, founded upon our 
values, is a set of rules and principles that 
guide our behaviours and actions, including 
guidance on complying with the UK Bribery 
Act 2010 and the Mexican General Law of the 
National Anti-Corruption System. Workshops 
and master classes are conducted regularly 
to embed ethics and integrity in the culture, 
in combination with an online training 
programme and evaluation to effectively reach 
employees. We recognise that embedding 
ethics in the culture as a core competence  
in the organisational structure support our 
strategic and operating goals.
Board oversight 
The Health, Safety, Environment and 
Community Relations Committee has been 
given responsibility for overseeing the ethics 
programme on behalf of the Board.
 See pages 91-92
Our Values
We aspire to demonstrate a well-
established ethical culture through 
our actions and behaviours. Our 
values are the cornerstone of our 
Ethics and Culture programme.
Vertical conveyor at the Fresnillo mine 08
Fresnillo plc Annual Report 2016
However, we also encountered operational 
challenges. The Fresnillo mine faced 
ongoing issues and failed to reach its 
projected production. While silver grades 
were slightly higher than in 2015, volumes 
came under pressure due to a shortage  
of skilled personnel, leading to insufficient 
mine development and preparation,  
as well as narrower veins. Management 
oversight and mine planning have been  
strengthened and we expect gradual and 
continued improvement over the coming 
year. Fortunately, a solid performance at 
Saucito and the initial contribution of San 
Julián compensated for the shortfall and 
the Group as a whole met its silver targets 
for the year.
The first phase of San Julián was 
commissioned in the year, despite a delay, 
and is now operating above its nominal 
capacity, contributing to annual silver  
and gold production. The second phase is 
expected to be commissioned in 2Q 2017, 
also at a delay of several months from the 
previous target, as the impact of certain 
external factors had been underestimated, 
including unforeseen extreme weather, 
delays in equipment deliveries and 
difficulties in obtaining permits. We  
remain confident that San Julián will be  
a successful new mine and may open up 
additional growth potential in the district.
The Board approved the resumption of  
the Pyrites project in the Fresnillo District, 
which will improve overall recoveries of 
gold and silver contents by processing 
historical and ongoing tailings from  
the Fresnillo and Saucito mines,  
which otherwise would have been lost. 
Always an attractive project from an  
IRR perspective, the Board’s decision  
to resume construction was supported  
by better than expected cash generation  
in the first half of the year and a healthy 
balance sheet.
The Board also approved the construction 
of a second line at the Dynamic Leaching 
Plant (DLP) at Herradura to increase gold 
recovery from the Centauro pit, and thus 
higher production from this mine. We 
continue to evaluate a major expansion 
of Herradura based on the most recent 
exploration results below the open pit. 
Furthermore, Juanicipio, our joint venture 
with Mag Silver, will be presented to the 
Board for approval in 2017.
Exploration results were positive, with an 
8.2% and 10.2% increase in total gold and 
silver resources, respectively. Gold reserves 
remained stable, whilst silver reserves 
decreased 3.2%. Our resource base remains 
very sound as we progress towards our 
2018 goals.
Chairman’s Statement continued
I deeply regret to report that three fatal 
accidents occurred in the year , as well as 
one in early 2017 , a major setback for our 
safety programme. Following investigations, 
management has taken decisive steps to 
prevent the type of human errors that are 
invariably a root cause in these accidents. 
Safety continues to be our highest priority, 
above production and profitability, yet we 
recognise that even with best-in-class 
systems and practices in place, our safety 
culture must be further strengthened and 
deeply embedded within the Company.  
T o that end, the Board’s Health, Safety, 
Environment and Community Relations 
(HSECR) Committee continued to review 
the culture and values as part of its work  
in overseeing the safety culture in 2016.
Dividends
Fresnillo plc’s dividend policy takes into 
account the profitability of the business 
and underlying earnings, as well as the 
Group’s capital requirements and cash 
flows. An annual dividend of between 
33-50% of profit after tax is paid out  
each year in the approximate proportion  
of one-third as an interim dividend and 
two-thirds as a final dividend. This provides 
the required flexibility to consider the 
cyclical behaviour of precious metal prices 
and other factors that could affect our 
financial position.
For 2016, the Board declared an interim 
dividend of 8.6 US cents per share and  
a final dividend of 21.5 US cents per  
share, totalling US$158.4 million. We  
believe the Group remains well placed  
to meet its current and future financial 
requirements, including its development 
and exploration projects.
Our governance agenda
The Board’s agenda in 2016 was focused 
on ensuring continued compliance with 
the UK Corporate Governance Code, 
addressing outstanding and emerging 
issues related to our 2014 External Board 
Evaluation action plan, Group culture  
and the composition of the Board with 
regards to the number of Independent 
Non-executive Directors. 09
Fresnillo plc Annual Report 2016
FRESNILLO TODAY STRATEGIC REPORT CORPORATE GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
My colleagues and I take an active role in 
setting Group strategy, reviewing progress 
against plan and ensuring sufficient 
flexibility to respond to changing market 
conditions within the context of our 
commitment to continuous investment 
through metal price cycles. As part of  
the Board’s planning process, we seek  
to ensure that capital allocation balances 
growth, shareholder returns, financial 
strength and flexibility, within the context 
of a maturing sustainability framework 
centred on good corporate governance, 
environmental stewardship and 
constructive community engagement.
Board changes
Charles Jacobs was appointed Senior 
Independent Director at the AGM in May 
2016, and we welcomed Alberto Tiburcio 
to the Board as an Independent Non-
executive Director, serving on the Audit 
Committee. As Chairman and CEO of  
Ernst & Y oung Mexico from 2001 until  
his retirement in 2013, Mr Tiburcio brings 
with him extensive experience as statutory 
auditor and advisor to many prestigious 
Mexican companies.
I am grateful for the service of the two 
members who stood down from the Board 
in 2016: Rafael MacGregor, Non-executive 
Director, whose role as Chairman of  
the Health, Safety, Environment and 
Community Relations Committee has  
been filled by Arturo Fernández, Non-
executive Director; and María Asunción 
Aramburuzabala, Independent Non-
executive Director who also served on the 
HSECR Committee. Both Directors made 
significant contributions to the Board and 
Company during their eight and four years 
of respective service.
Looking ahead
Despite their recovery during the year, we 
believe gold and silver prices will remain 
volatile. Indeed, renewed signs of weakness 
at year end 2016 due to expectations of 
rising interest rates in the US point to the 
uncertainty of any sustained recovery. 
Furthermore, geopolitical factors such as 
Brexit, the new administration in the US, 
ongoing tensions in the Middle East and 
developments in China and India make 
forecasting unpredictable. 
We therefore maintain our disciplined 
approach to investment: growth projects 
will continue to be evaluated against a 
range of metrics, including operational  
and technical factors, pricing and market 
considerations, and our financial position.
For 2017, we have increased our year-on-
year capital expenditures and exploration 
budget, by 71.1% over the 2016 spend,  
to US$950 million. We believe this level  
of investment enables us to achieve our 
2018 goals while setting the groundwork 
for the next decade of the Company’s 
development. 
Dedicated to meeting our commitments
The goals to which we held ourselves 
accountable at the time of our IPO in 2008 
have changed only insomuch as some 
targets have already been met, notably  
our gold production as a result of the 
acquisition of 44% of Penmont and 
continued improvements at Herradura.
For the near term, our focus will be on 
efficiency, cost control and meeting our 
operational commitments: the turnaround 
of the Fresnillo mine and the successful 
start-up of the second phase of San Julián. 
We will continue to set the bar higher for 
ourselves in other areas such as safety, 
governance processes and organisational 
effectiveness. The latter may be more 
difficult to quantify, but is as vital to 
long-term shareholder value creation as 
our low cost operations, project pipeline 
and portfolio of exploration projects that 
serve as key drivers of future growth.
Our ability to meet these commitments 
depends chiefly on our people. T ogether 
with my fellow Directors, I extend  
my gratitude for their dedication and  
hard work.

Dedicated to Meeting 
Our Commitments
Having already surpassed our gold production 
targets, we must ensure that our silver mines 
deliver as planned in the coming years: 
successfully turning around performance at 
Fresnillo with accelerated development rates 
and plant optimisation; increasing the rate of 
development to sustain capacity utilisation at 
Saucito; and delivering the second phase of San 
Julián. We also seek to replenish reserves and 
improve productivity at each of our mines.

Chief Executive’s Letter
Optimising performance
There were challenges and setbacks,  
to be sure – three fatalities, which we see  
as unacceptable, slower than expected 
turnaround at our flagship Fresnillo mine 
and technical issues and construction 
delays at San Julián – but also remarkable 
improvements in capacity utilisation, 
notably at Saucito and Herradura,  
and cash costs across the organisation.  
This comes in the context of volatile  
but improved metal prices that boosted 
revenues, profits and our cash position.
My enthusiasm for improved market 
conditions is somewhat tempered by  
their current unpredictability. In years  
past, precious metals prices were generally 
driven upward by supply constraints, 
geopolitical tensions and investors seeking 
safe havens. Over the course of 2016, these 
fundamentals may not have impacted 
pricing the way we have come to expect, 
confounding both industry analysts and 
market experts.
However, at Fresnillo, we have always 
believed that strategy and execution  
are the true drivers of value creation.  
We look to operational excellence, targeted 
investment, disciplined cash management 
and sustainable business practices as  
the benchmark of success. In that regard,  
I remain confident that we are on the  
right path to meeting our commitments  
to profitability and sustainability across 
precious metal price cycles. 
T o support this, we are undertaking  
a comprehensive review of the role 
technology and innovation play in 
managing the internal variables under  
our control, and the extent to which our 
systems and data are secure. I am leading 
the IT Governance Committee through  
a digital transformation: everything from 
personnel management and predictive 
maintenance, to mine ventilation, simulator 
training and reactant consumption.  
We have implemented a number of new 
systems already and will continue to 
monitor their effectiveness in delivering 
results and driving our competitive 
advantage, while bolstering our 
cybersecurity protocols.
I am pleased to report a solid 
performance in 2016, with a  
rise in production, delivery of 
the first phase of a key growth 
project, expansion of our 
resource base and a maturing 
sustainability framework. 
By design our 
mines are set  
to yield returns 
across the price 
cycle with all-in 
sustaining costs 
that are amongst 
the lowest in the 
industry.  17
Fresnillo plc Annual Report 2016
FRESNILLO TODAY STRATEGIC REPORT CORPORATE GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Operating performance
We produced a record 50.3 moz of silver 
in 2016 (including Silverstream), 7.1% over 
2015 and within our range of 49-51 moz. 
This was primarily due to the start-up of 
San Julián, higher ore grades at Fresnillo 
and Ciénega and, to a lesser extent, higher 
production from Silverstream.
While we met our silver production  
targets, I am disappointed that the Fresnillo 
mine fell short of its turnaround objectives. 
Our aim was to stabilise the rate of 
development at 4,500 metres per month  
in order to maintain throughput at levels 
that would offset the natural and expected 
decline in ore grade. However, due to a lack 
of equipment availability and a shortage  
of skilled personnel, we were unable to 
prepare sufficient infrastructure to sustain 
that rate of development, which put 
pressure on volumes. The Fresnillo mine 
produced 15.9 moz silver in 2016, 1.6% 
higher than in 2015, against our target  
of a double-digit increase. We have  
already made improvements but are 
looking to make additional progress  
in 2017 to deliver our targets.
Gold production reached a record level, 
increasing 22.8% over 2015 to 935.5 koz, 
against our revised guidance of 850-870 
koz. This was the result of the reductions 
of inventories from the leaching pads at 
Herradura, the start-up of phase I at San 
Julián and a higher speed of recovery at 
Noche Buena, which partially offset the 
expected lower ore grade and ore 
processed at Ciénega.
By-product lead production increased 
13.5% on 2015, to 48,144 tonnes, mainly 
as a result of higher ore grades at Fresnillo 
and Ciénega. Similarly, by-product zinc 
production increased 23.5% to 56,845 
tonnes due to higher ore grades and 
recovery rates at Fresnillo and Ciénega and 
increased ore throughput and recovery 
rate at Saucito. 
Construction of phase I of the San Julián 
mine was completed at a slight delay due 
to the need of the contractor to do some 
initial rectification. The milling facility and 
leaching plant were commissioned in the 
summer, and the plant exceeded design 
capacity in the final quarter of the year, 
contributing 2.1 moz to the Group’s total 
silver production and enhancing our 
productivity metrics. Start-up of the phase 
II flotation plant has been delayed from 
year end 2016 to 2Q 2017 due to unusually 
high rainfall, contractor turnover and delays 
in the delivery of certain equipment that 
affected the pace of construction.
Following Board approval of project 
resumption, we completed engineering  
for the new Pyrites plant, placed initial 
equipment orders and began construction. 
This US$155 million project will increase 
silver and gold recovery rates by 
processing tailings, both historical and 
ongoing, from the Fresnillo and Saucito 
mines, generating an expected 3.5 moz 
silver and 13 koz gold per year. The first 
phase leaching plant is expected to come 
on line in 1Q 2018, and the tailings flotation 
facility by year end 2018. 
The Centauro Extension project at 
Herradura, encompassing a second line  
to the dynamic leaching plant, has also 
been approved. Progress in the year 
included detailed engineering, advancing 
the foundations of the milling area  
and placement of orders for various 
components. The US$110 million project  
is expected to extend the life of the mine 
with average gold production of 390 koz 
per year.
Investment in exploration totalled US$137.9 
million, mainly focused on areas of 
influence at current operating mines and 
key exploration sites. Good results were 
achieved at Fresnillo, Saucito, San Julián, 
Pilarica and Guanajuato. 
Resources and reserves reflect the 
following price assumptions: silver at 
US$17.50 per oz (2015: US$15.00), gold  
in underground mines at US$1,250.00 per 
oz (2015: US$1,150.00), and gold in open  
pit resources at US$1,400.00 per oz (2015: 
US$1,300.00). Our high quality asset base 
remains healthy. Gold and silver resources 
increased by 8.2% and 10.2% respectively, 
whilst gold reserves remained unchanged 
and silver reserves decreased 3.2%. (Refer 
to Exploration pages 71-75)
A commitment to sustainable business 
practices
Robust sustainability practices not only 
underpin our licence to operate, they also 
lower operating risk and ensure alignment 
with stakeholders. T o coincide with our 
HSECR framework reaching maturity this 
year, we conducted our first materiality 
assessment to gauge the effectiveness of 
our sustainability strategy and the quality 
of our reporting, the results of which are 
set out on page 77.

Key commitments for 2017
Strengthen our safety performance 
with zero tolerance for non-
compliance, and increased 
investment and support for  
training and oversight.
Improve and optimise performance 
at the Fresnillo mine by developing 
infrastructure at the lower levels 
sufficient to increase the 
development rate to 4,800 metres 
per month by year end; commence 
work on plant optimisation; and 
continue the deepening of the San 
Carlos shaft and expansion of the 
tailings dam.
Commission the second phase of 
San Julián on time and on budget 
in 2Q 2017, including installing 
vibrating screens at the leaching 
plant to achieve an average  
of 4,000 tpd milling capacity. 
Furthermore, we will deploy 
efficiency teams to reduce costs, 
with a focus on drilling methods, 
and identify additional long-term 
sources of water for industrial use.
 See pages 28-29
These factors more than compensated  
for the additional production costs arising 
from the increased ore throughput at 
Herradura and Saucito. However, cost  
of sales increased by 1.2% over 2015  
mainly due to the decrease in inventories 
at Herradura following the increased 
processing capacity achieved with the 
commissioning of the second Merrill  
Crowe plant, as well as higher depreciation.
The increase in revenues more than offset 
the higher cost of sales, resulting in a 
103.7% increase in gross profit to US$882.1 
million. Gross margin was 46.3% compared 
to 30.0% in the previous year. The higher 
gross profit and lower administrative and 
exploration expenses resulted in an 88.5% 
increase in EBITDA, with an expansion  
in the margin from 37.9% in 2015 to 54.2% 
in 2016.
Profit from continuing operations  
before income tax increased by 238.2%  
to US$718.2 million. Income tax expense 
increased 101.4% to US$259.9 million as  
a result of higher profits, with an effective 
tax rate of 36.2% excluding the special 
mining right (2015: 60.7%), and 40.8% 
including the effects of the special mining 
right (2015: 67.3%). Net profit for the period 
was US$425.0 million, a 512.4% increase 
over 2015.
The 20.1% devaluation of the Mexican peso 
against the US dollar as of 31 December 
resulted in non-cash charges to the income 
statement and affected the monetary 
position and value of certain assets and 
liabilities, resulting in a higher deferred  
tax charge. 
Cash flow generated by operations, before 
changes in working capital, increased by 
90.5% to US$1,023.3 million as a result of 
higher profits. Capital expenditure totalled 
US$434.1 million, a decrease of 8.6% over 
2015; key investments in the year included 
construction at the San Julián project, 
stripping activities and the construction  
of the leaching pads at Herradura, and 
development at Fresnillo, Ciénega and 
Saucito. Other uses of funds in the year 
were income tax and profit sharing paid  
of US$114.8 million and dividends paid of 
US$88.2 million. We closed the year net 
cash flow positive.
The Group maintained a strong balance 
sheet. Cash, cash equivalents and short-term 
investments totalled US$912.0 million, an 
82.3% increase over 2015; debt remained at 
US$800.0 million as at 31 December 2016.
A detailed review of our performance is set 
out in the Financial Review.
Outlook 2017
By design, our mines are set to yield 
returns across the price cycle, with all-in 
sustaining costs that are amongst the 
lowest in the industry, giving us financial 
and operating flexibility in a range of 
market conditions. We aim to produce 
58–61 moz of silver, including 4 moz from 
the Silverstream, and 870–900 koz of gold 
in 2017, reflecting no further production 
benefit from the reduction of inventories  
at Herradura. 
Given the uncertainty of forecasting 
precious metals prices in the current 
environment, we continue to take a 
cautious approach and investment 
decisions will be evaluated on a project-by-
project basis against key criteria; US$800 
million has been budgeted for capital 
expenditures in 2017, to be allocated 
primarily to San Julián, the Pyrites plant, 
the second line of the DLP and, pending 
approval, initial construction at Juanicipio, 
as well as sustaining capex at current 
operations including the Fresnillo 
expansion. A further US$160 million  
has been budgeted for exploration, 
including capitalised expenses. 
The Centauro Deep and Ciénega 
expansion projects are still under 
exploration prior to Board evaluation, while 
every effort will be made to improve and 
enhance project metrics for longer-term 
growth prospects such as Orisyvo.
Our strategic goals are unchanged: to 
profitably and sustainably maintain the 
Group’s position as the world’s largest 
primary silver company and a leading gold 
producer in Mexico. Our high quality, low 
cost assets, extensive growth pipeline and 
balance sheet strength leave us well placed 
to deliver on our 2018 production and 
reserves targets. More immediately, we are 
focused on meeting our commitments to 
improve and optimise performance at the 
Fresnillo mine, commission the second 
phase of San Julián on time and on budget, 
and strengthen our safety performance.
I am grateful for the continued confidence 
placed in us by our people, communities, 
suppliers, clients and shareholders, and 
look forward to another year together.

1. Adjusted production costs is calculated as total production costs less depreciation, profit sharing  
and the effects of exchange rate hedging.
We fell short of our safety targets this year , 
with three fatal injuries in 2016 and one  
at the beginning of 2017 . We have taken  
a number of steps to strengthen our safety 
culture, including the implementation of  
a new Safety Information System. Our 
decision to terminate a Company contractor 
this year reflects the prioritisation of safety 
above all other operational considerations, 
notwithstanding the shortage of contractors 
in certain districts as well as the short-term 
impact on production.
However, we made important advances in 
other metrics of sustainability in the areas 
of health, environment and community 
relations. These include chronic illnesses 
and water utilisation rates. 
Financial results
Our average realised gold and silver prices 
rose by 10.7% and 10.3%, respectively. As a 
result, adjusted revenues totalled US$2,045 
million, 29.2% above the previous year. 
Adjusted production costs 
1 
decreased by 
2.5%, mainly explained by the favourable 
effect of the 17.7% average devaluation of 
the Mexican peso vs. the US dollar during 
2016, lower energy prices and the positive 
impact of our cost reduction initiatives.  19

Investment Case
Strong balance sheet
Operational flexibility, investment across 
price cycles, shareholder returns
With a healthy cash position and low leverage ratio,  
we can invest in profitable growth and optimise 
operations, while delivering solid returns to shareholders. 
In 2016, capital expenditures totalled US$434.1 million, 
exploration US$121.2 million and we paid out US$88.2 
million in dividends.
High quality assets
Long-term visibility, long life returns 
We are amongst the largest concession holders in 
mineral-rich Mexico, holding approximately 1.8 million 
hectares of surface land, with a district consolidation 
strategy that allows us to leverage local knowledge and 
shared infrastructure. Our portfolio of low cost gold  
and silver mines, high potential development projects 
and advanced exploration prospects contain over 2,171.5 
moz of attributable silver resources and 38.4 moz  
of attributable gold resources.
Low cost and flexible operations 
Healthy margins, adaptability across  
price cycles 
Our high quality assets allow us to extract mineral 
profitably across metal price cycles. Furthermore,  
we are able to tailor mine plans, leverage technology 
and share personnel, expertise and plant capacity 
within our districts to maximise the potential of each 
operation. A focus on continuous improvement in 
productivity, efficiency and consumption of operating 
materials and energy combined with favourable 
exchange rates, helped reduce cost per tonne across  
all our mines in 2016. 
Disciplined approach  
to development 
Long-term profitable growth
Every development project must meet stringent  
viability criteria, including rates of return and high 
environmental and social impact standards. Delivery 
timelines and budgets are calibrated to advance  
us towards production targets whilst adjusting for 
market conditions, with engineering and construction 
conducted by in-house teams. We are on track to deliver 
phase II of the San Julián mine in 2017 and the new 
pyrites plant in 2018.
Sustainable business practices 
Environmental stewardship, social licence  
to operate, ethical culture
T o drive value for all our stakeholders and ensure 
operational continuity, we must understand and 
respect the needs of local communities; prioritise  
local goods, services and employees for our operations; 
ensure the safety and health of our people; and 
minimise our environmental footprint. We invested  
over US$21.1 million in our HSECR initiatives in 2016, 
10.7% higher than in 2015.
Our key competitive advantages 
position us to meet near-term 
commitments and drive long-
term value. 
Dynamic Leaching Plant at Herradura 20
Fresnillo plc Annual Report 2016
Market Overview
Our strategy arises from the context of the silver and gold 
mining industry and the business environment in Mexico.
As a major silver and gold mining 
company, we are exposed to the market 
dynamics common to the global precious 
metals industry, while our people and 
operations, virtually all located in Mexico, 
are exposed to country-specific factors 
that affect our operations.
The precious metals market
Our top-line performance and that of  
our peers is driven by precious metals 
prices, which reflect traditional supply  
and demand dynamics that arise from the 
industry’s production capacity in relation 
to consumption, which in turn is driven  
by market sentiment. However, market 
sentiment has become significantly less 
predictable in response to geopolitical  
and macroeconomic variables in recent 
years, and rather notably so in 2016.
The two key political developments  
in 2016 with potential to impact our  
Group were the UK’s decision to exit  
the European Union, and the election  
of Donald Trump as president of the  
US, both of which resulted in strong,  
albeit dissimilar, reactions by equity 
markets and currency exchange rates.  
We do not believe that Brexit will have  
a direct material impact on the Group, 
given that our operations are in Mexico. 
The effect of the new US administration, 
while still difficult to predict until political, 
economic and trade policies are fully 
implemented, has thus far only affected  
us in terms of the reduction of the value 
of the peso in relation to the US dollar.
Fresnillo plc does not take a position  
on where prices, demand or market 
sentiment are headed; however, we do 
monitor price movements and market 
dynamics, and take into consideration 
industry research and forecasts in order  
to support our financial projections and 
cash management strategies. We use 
analyst consensus as the base case 
scenario for our internal projections, and 
conduct sensitivity analyses with floor  
and ceiling prices of between 10-20% 
above and below those consensus figures. 
As a result, metals prices will continue to 
influence budget considerations in areas 
such as exploration and the timing of 
certain capital expenditures.

Market size and position
In silver, our peer group are other primary 
silver miners although much of the global 
silver production is derived as a by-product 
of gold, lead, zinc and copper mines. We 
have long been the top global producer of 
silver, both by-product and primary, and 
aim to maintain our leadership position 
amongst global producers. 
Benchmarking our performance  
in the industry
T o assess our competitiveness within  
our peer groups, we look primarily at the 
following two factors, neither of which  
are influenced by market dynamics: 
Average cash cost per metal: We track 
all-in sustaining costs (AISC) in accordance 
with the guidelines issued by the World 
Gold Council, as a means to monitor 
current production costs and preparations 
for future production; however, we  
also continue to use the traditional  
cash cost 
1
 metric as we believe it is more 
representative of the production costs 
incurred during the period, eliminating 
distortions caused by non-recurring 
sustaining costs. Our strategic objective  
is to remain in the lowest quartile of the 
cost curves, which we achieved at most  
of our mines in 2016. See pages 58-67.
Quality and quantity of our mineral assets: 
Cash costs provide a picture of a 
company’s current ability to extract  
its resources at a reasonable cost, but 
long-term competitiveness is dependent 
on the actual size of the resource base.  
A strong indicator of future production is 
the ability to convert measured, indicated 
and inferred resources into proven and 
probable reserves.
We continuously invest in exploration 
across price cycles to expand and 
strengthen our asset base; as a result,  
our total resources and reserves have 
grown steadily since our IPO, and we have 
a range of organic growth projects that 
extend across the prospecting, drilling  
and resource definition stages. See pages 
71-75.
Key trends shaping the precious  
metals industry
Our industry faces a number of underlying 
trends that impact competitiveness and 
viability. As many of these coincide with 
our key risks, more detailed information 
regarding the specific implications for 
Fresnillo plc and our response and 
mitigation efforts can be found on pages 
42-55.
Capital remains constrained. Although 
prices for many metals improved in 2016, 
the cumulative effect of years of depressed 
prices has put pressure on profits and 
balance sheets in recent years. Process 
improvements, innovation, better resource 
utilisation and lower energy costs have 
helped cut costs and improve productivity, 
but many miners remain vulnerable  
in the current environment and have 
insufficient cash reserves to sustain capital 
requirements and investments in growth. 
Traditional sources of external financing, 
including equity markets and institutional 
lenders, are seeking higher returns and 
premiums for their capital, even when 
allocated to high quality mining companies.
Metal supply is limited, and ore grades are 
declining. No new major deposits have 
been identified in recent years, thus  
mine lives will be reduced if volumes  
are sustained at current operations.  
Miners will increasingly rely on lower  
grade deposits or those with more complex 
metallurgy, while the search for new 
deposits may take more time, be in less 
hospitable and secure areas, and lack the 
economies of scale that bigger and richer 
deposits would allow. T aken together, 
exploration and exploitation will require 
significantly more capital at a time when 
the industry is facing the aforementioned 
capital constraints.
Environmental and social costs of 
maintaining mining operations have 
increased, and anti-mining activism 
continues to rise. Resource nationalism  
in many mining jurisdictions has affected 
regulation and taxation, while pressure 
from non-governmental organisations 
(NGOs) and communities, both organised 
and ad hoc, have led to work stoppages, 
project closures, and increased pressure  
for more tangible community benefits  
and shared value creation mechanisms.
Mexico: Country challenges specific  
to Fresnillo plc
Securing land access and ownership. 
Mining concessions in Mexico provide 
rights to the mineral resources in the 
subsoil, not the surface land, thus 
concession holders must negotiate private 
agreements with landowners. Inconsistent 
registration and enforcement of inherited 
ownership rights for communal land has 
led to renegotiation of land agreements in 
some cases, and to demands for increased 
rent for land, water and occupancy rights.
Continued insecurity. Some regions of the 
country, particularly in the states of Baja 
California, Durango, Sinaloa, Guerrero, 
Chihuahua, Michoacán, T amaulipas and 
Nuevo León, face unacceptably high rates 
of violent crime, primarily due to drug 
cartel activity. Despite the escalation of 
military engagement and law enforcement, 
security remains a critical issue.
Corruption. Mexico is ranked the  
123rd of 176 countries on Transparency 
International’s 2016 Corruption Perceptions 
Index 
2
, a composite index drawing on 
corruption-related data from experts and 
business. Bribery is seen to be widespread 
in the country’s judiciary and police, and in 
business registration processes, including 
getting construction permits and licenses. 
Collusion between the police, judges and 
criminal groups stems from complex 
jurisdictions and cartel pressure, which 
contributes to the security problem  
and results in impunity and weak law 
enforcement. While attempted bribery, 
extortion, abuse of office, bribery of  
foreign public officials and facilitation are 
criminalised under the Federal Penal Code 
(Código Penal Federal), anti-corruption 
laws are almost never enforced. See page 
78 for the Fresnillo plc policy on Anti-
Bribery.
1. We define cash cost as the total cash cost (cost of sales plus treatment and refining charges,

Business Model and Strategy
We seek to create sustained value for stakeholders across 
precious metal cycles, focusing on high potential silver  
and gold projects that can be developed into low cost, 
world-class mines. 
Business model
Gold and silver mining is the heart of our 
business model. We generate revenue by selling 
the metals contained in the ore we extract and

 Operate
Silver and gold production both 
increased in the year; silver, with 
the start-up of San Julián, and 
higher ore grades at Fresnillo and 
Ciénega, and gold mainly as a result 
of the reduction in inventories from 
the leaching pads at Herradura. 
The devaluation of the Mexican 
peso, combined with our continued 
focus on efficiency and controlling 
costs, led to lower cost per tonne  
at every mine.

 Operate KPIs
Graph illustrates silver production from our own mines, 
with the shaded portion representing additional ounces 
accrued under the Silverstream Contract. 
Increased silver production due to the start-up of San 
Julián and higher silver grades at Ciénega and Fresnillo.
Decrease in cost per tonne due to the favourable effect of 
the devaluation of the Mexican peso/US dollar exchange 
rate and lower diesel and electricity prices partly offset  
by higher contractor costs to accelerate development.
Decrease in cost per tonne due to the positive effect  
of the exchange rate, lower unit prices of operating 
materials and efficiencies achieved. 
Decrease in cost per tonne as a result of foreign  
exchange benefits, lower unit energy prices and 
efficiencies achieved.
Increased gold production due to the reduction  
of inventories from the leaching pads at Herradura, 
contribution from San Julián and higher speeds  
of recovery at Noche Buena. 
Decrease in cost per tonne due to the favourable effect  
of the exchange rate, economies of scale from higher 
throughput and lower unit energy prices.

The Fatal Injury Frequency Rate (FIFR), which measures 
fatalities per one million hours worked and had been a KPI 
in previous years, is no longer considered a key indicator 
as it dilutes the impact of fatalities in light of rising activity 
levels. FFIR remains an internal performance indicator, as 
seen on page 84 in the Social and Sustainability Report.
Lost-time injuries are work-related injuries rendering any

Managing Our Risks
Risk management system
The annual and ongoing elements of  
the Group’s risk management process  
are controlled by well-established risk 
identification, assessment and monitoring 
processes. We have continued to build on 
our existing risk management framework, 
enhancing risk management and internal 
control systems across the business in  
line with changes to the UK Corporate 
Governance Code. 
In addition to our established risk 
management activities, our priority  
for 2016 was to promote a ‘monitoring 
environment’ which consists of validating 
the effectiveness of our current controls  
in order to support the Board in their 
responsibilities of monitoring and reviewing 
risk management and the internal control 
systems. For this task, over the course  
of 2016, operations managers, the 
controllership group, HSECR managers 
and exploration managers have all  
been engaged in strengthening their 
understanding of internal controls 
monitoring requirements. 
2016 risk assessment
Our 2016 risk assessment exercise took 
place across all our operations, advanced 
projects, exploration offices and support 
and corporate areas, which identified and 
evaluated 107 risks, including three new 
risks added over the course of the year 
that reflect specific circumstances related 
to certain projects (2015: 104 risks). This 
universe was narrowed down into major 
risks monitored by Executive Management 
and the Audit Committee, and then further 
consolidated into 11 principal risks closely 
monitored by the Board of Directors. 
For the bottom-up process, business  
unit heads determined the perceived level 
of risk for their individual unit. Executive 
Management then reviewed and 
challenged each perceived risk level, and 
compared it to Fresnillo plc’s risk universe 
as a whole. The results of this exercise  
were used as an additional input for the 
identification of the Group’s principal risks. 
The same risk analysis was conducted on 
advanced projects, detailing the specific 
risks faced by each project according to 
their unique characteristics and conditions. 
The risk heat map for each business unit 
and development project is included in the 
Review of Operations (pages 58-70).
A number of developments have adversely 
impacted the entire Mexican mining 
industry in recent years as reflected in  
the Investment Attractiveness Index 
1
 that 
assesses how mineral endowments and 
public policy factors, such as taxation and 
regulatory uncertainty, affect exploration 
and mining investment. Specific examples 
that have impacted the industry in Mexico 
include: weak rule of law in disbanding 
illegal blockades to mining assets; legal 
uncertainty regarding certain land tenure 
issues; instances of community opposition 
to mining resulting in the cancellation  
of major projects; aggressive and 
unfavourable tax requirements that 
disadvantage Mexico relative to other 
mining countries; and the adverse  
security environment still facing a  
number of regions in the country.
Based on the aforementioned 
circumstances, we assessed that the  
risk rating levels for potential actions  
by the government (e.g. taxes), security, 
and public perception against mining  
have increased for 2017. In addition,  
while the Board has always given the 
highest priority to safety issues, three  
fatal accidents occurred in 2016 and one  
in early 2017; thus we also elevated the  
risk rating level for safety to reflect this 
troubling reversal of our safety record.  
As with all our key risks, the Board and  
the Executive Committee continue to 
closely monitor them.

1. Impact of global macroeconomic developments
Risk description Response/mitigation Risk appetite Link to strategy
There could be an adverse 
impact on our sales and profits, 
and potentially the economic 
viability of projects, from 
macroeconomic developments 
such as:
• A decrease in precious metal 
prices (primary driver of the 
risk); even though this was not 
the case for silver and gold  
in 2016, with higher annual 
average realised prices over 
the previous year of 10.3%  
and 10.7% respectively; the 
high uncertainty of economic 
markets still positions this risk 
at the top of our scale. 
• Exchange rates, for the  
same reasons of volatility  
and uncertainty; while most 
currencies lost value vs. the 
US dollar in 2016, the Mexican 
peso suffered a devaluation 
of 17.7% vs. the average spot 
exchange rate of the US dollar.
• General inflation in Mexico 
which was 3.42% in Mexican 
pesos in 2016; the specific 
deflation affecting the 
Company was 8.08%  
in US dollar terms.
• A decrease in the price of the 
Company’s by-products; this 
was not the case in 2016, with 
the average annual prices for 
lead and zinc rising 7.0% and 
20.0%, respectively, over the 
previous year. 
Fresnillo’s hedging policy remains guided  
by the principle of providing shareholders  
with full exposure to gold and silver prices. 
However, following shareholder approval  
for the acquisition of 44% of Penmont (and 
associated companies) in 2014, we initiated  
a specific hedging programme to protect the 
value of the investment made in the acquisition, 
using a collar structure to allow partial continued 
exposure to gold prices. The volume associated 
with this phased hedging programme was 
strictly limited to up to the 44% of production 
associated with the acquired Penmont assets 
and will not be extended to other assets in the 
Group. The total volume hedged was 1,559,689 
oz of which 242,000 oz matured in 2016 with  
a profit of US$48,158. (For more details, see 
Financial Review pages 102)
Fresnillo is not precluded from entering into 
derivatives to minimise its exposure to changes 
in the prices of lead and zinc by-products. As in 
previous years, the Group entered into a hedging 
structure in 2016 to mitigate the risk related to 
the sale of lead and zinc. See note 31 in the 
Financial Statements page 211. 
Furthermore, we have hedging policies in  
place for foreign exchange risk, including  
those associated with capex related to projects. 
The Company entered into a number of foreign 
exchange forward contracts denominated in 
Canadian dollars, euros and Swedish kronas. 
See note 31 in the Financial Statements page 210.
A significant increase is expected in some of 
our main energy inputs (diesel and electricity), 
because of the increase in international 
petroleum prices and the market liberalisation  
of fuel prices in Mexico. We will continue to 
identify efficiency initiatives to improve our 
energy consumption.

During 2016 all 
macroeconomic 
variables favoured our 
financial results, however 
volatility and uncertainty 
were constants in the 
same period (and are 
expected to remain as 
such in 2017); therefore 
we still consider the 
impact of global 
macroeconomic 
developments our 
principal risk driver; in 
addition, most industry 
and financial analysts 
who follow metal prices 
continue to foresee 
volatility in silver and 
gold prices for 2017, with 
a notable spread among 
forecasts, meaning 
continued volatility.

2. Access to land
Risk description Response/mitigation Risk appetite Link to strategy
Failure or significant delays in 
accessing the surface land above 
our mineral concessions and other 
land of interest is a persistent risk to 
our strategy, with a potentially high 
impact on our objectives. Possible 
barriers to land access include:
• Rising expectations of land 
owners.
• Refusal to acknowledge prior 
land acquisition terms and 
conditions by members of  
an agrarian community.
• Influence of multiple special 
interests in land negotiations.
• Conflicts in land boundaries  
with an often arduous  
resolution process.
• Succession issues among land 
owners resulting in a lack of 
clarity about the legal entitlement 
to possess and sell land.
• Litigation risk i.e. increased 
activism by agrarian communities 
and/or judicial authorities.
Furthermore, insecurity and conflicts 
in our exploration and operation 
areas increase the complexity of 
land access.
T o maximise our opportunities for  
successful land access we actively manage 
our mining rights focusing on areas of 
interest or strategic value; at the end of  
2016, after adding required areas and 
divesting areas of less interest, we held  
1.8 million hectares, a 11.4% decrease vs.  
2015. Other initiatives include:
• Plan well in advance for land requirements 
and acquisitions (e.g. anticipating any 
issues with a potential land purchase 
before intensive exploration). In certain 
areas of interest, leasing or occupation 
agreements with purchase options  
are negotiated.
• Foster strong community relations 
through investment in community 
programmes and infrastructure. Such 
investments totalled US$2.6 million  
in 2016.
• Always seek tri-party cooperation 
between the government, community 
and ourselves in securing access to land.
• Early involvement of our community 
relations teams during negotiation  
and acquisition processes, including  
the exploration stage.
• Continue working with our land 
negotiation teams, comprising 
negotiators hired directly by Fresnillo  
and also provided by Peñoles as part  
of the service agreement.
We have almost concluded a comprehensive 
review of the legal status of the Company’s 
land rights in order to mitigate or eliminate 
litigation risk. Certain areas of opportunity 
were identified and we continue to 
implement measures to manage this risk  
on a case-by-case basis. Such measures 
include, whenever possible, negotiating  
with agrarian communities the outright 
purchase of land through mechanisms 
provided under agrarian law as well as 
utilising other legal mechanisms under 
mining law which afford added protection 
for land occupation. The Company has 
already closed several such agreements  
in the states of Sonora and Zacatecas.

Description of risk change
The mining industry 
continues to face legal 
challenges in regard  
to access to land by 
individuals and local 
communities who may 
seek to disregard previous 
land agreements; this  
has been a permanent 
difficulty in recent years.
Thus, despite all  
the strategic actions 
undertaken by the 
Company, the perceived 
level of this risk remains 
very high.

3. Potential actions by the government, e.g. implementation of more stringent regulations for obtaining permits, etc.
Risk description Response/mitigation Risk appetite Link to strategy
The implementation of new 
governmental requirements  
may have an adverse impact  
on us, as would other potential,  
not yet materialised, or more 
stringent ecological or explosives 
regulations, or more difficult 
processes to obtain permits.
On 31 December 2016, the state  
of Zacatecas in northern Mexico 
published a new tax law (the ‘T ax 
Law’) that came into effect on 
1 January 2017, which includes a  
new set of ‘environmental taxes’ 
relating to the following activities 
undertaken within the state:
i. Extraction of materials other  
than minerals referenced in 
Article 4 of the Mexican Mining 
Law (gold, silver, lead, zinc, etc.) 
from the soil and sub-soil 
through open-pit processes;
ii. Emissions of certain substances 
into the atmosphere;
iii. Deposit of contaminants into  
the soil and water; and
iv. Storage of waste in public  
or private landfills.
In addition, the T ax Law also 
includes certain other modifications 
and adjustments to pre-existing 
taxes in Zacatecas such as the 
payroll tax and the tax for the 
University of Zacatecas.
A 2015 case brought before Mexico’s 
Supreme Court of Justice looked at 
the right of indigenous communities 
within the overall process for 
granting mining concessions. While 
the ruling did not find in favour of 
the communities in this case, such 
matters may arise again and affect 
the granting of new concessions  
in Mexico.
The Company, together with its internal  
and external advisors, is conducting a full 
assessment of the detail of the T ax Law as 
well as its potential impact on the Company. 
As a result of this review, the Company 
believes that there are solid grounds to 
legally challenge, on a Federal level, the 
imposition of this T ax Law. We are currently 
formulating an appropriate defence 
strategy. Should legal challenges not prove 
successful, we estimate that the potential 
net impact of these new taxes on the 
Company’s income statement would be  
in the range of US$4-7 million for the 2017 
fiscal year. 
We continue to collaborate with other 
members of the mining community via the 
Mexican Mining Chamber to lobby against 
this and any other new detrimental taxes, 
royalties, or regulations. We also support 
the industry’s lobbying efforts to improve 
the general public’s understanding of the 
Mining Law. 
The Company remains in compliance with 
all applicable environmental regulations  
and is fully committed to operating in  
a sustainable way.
Indigenous consultation is an ongoing 
matter, thus we continue to monitor 
developments and work with the Mexican 
Mining Chamber on the issue. While  
no new regulation has been defined 
following the dismissal of the 2015  
court case, a significant change to  
the Mining Law could take time due  
to the complexity of the terms and 
proceedings yet to be discussed.

Description of risk change
We continue to perceive 
this risk level as very high 
due to the great pressure 
that the government 
could exert over the 
mining industry, as  
is the case described  
of the imposition of the 
environmental taxes 
contained in the new  
T ax Law in Zacatecas,  
as well as the continued 
perceived level of 
corruption across Mexico, 
which remains high. We 
share a general industry 
view that regrettably, local 
and regional governments 
in particular have 
worsened in this regard, 
notwithstanding the 
national effort to 
implement an 
anticorruption system, 
which is not yet fully 
deployed. As a result, 
delays in obtaining 
permits for certain 
operations and/or  
projects remain a risk.  46

4. Security
Risk description Response/mitigation Risk appetite Link to strategy
Our people, contractors and 
suppliers face the risk of kidnapping, 
extortion or harm due to security 
conditions in the regions where  
we operate. We face the risk of 
restricted access to operations/
projects and theft of assets.
The influence of drug cartels,  
other criminal elements and general 
lawlessness in the regions where  
we operate, combined with our 
exploration and project activities  
in areas of transfer or cultivation  
of drugs, makes working in these 
areas of particular risk for us.
We recognise the importance  
of confidentiality, continuity,  
integrity and security of our data 
and production systems. Whilst 
cybersecurity has not risen to  
the level of a key risk, it continues  
to merit ongoing management 
oversight and review.
We closely monitor the security situation, 
maintain clear internal communications  
and coordinate work in areas of higher 
insecurity, along with the following practices 
to manage our security risks and prevent 
possible incidents:
• We maintain close relations with 
authorities, including army encampments 
installed near a certain number of  
our operations. We also maintain a 
relationship with the army secretariat  
at the regional level in order to align  
and coordinate efforts in the regions 
where we operate.
• We designed and engineered the 
standard of technological and physical 
security measures for all of our business 
units. Implementation was completed  
at the dynamic leaching plant and other 
areas in Penmont during 2016, and we 
expect to conclude the process in the 
remaining Business Units (BUs) in 2017.
• All BUs have a chief of security who 
coordinates internal and external 
personnel to improve the efficiency of 
our security strategy. For 2017 we aim to 
work with security contractors to convert 
our personnel into professionally trained 
specialists in managing security risks and 
to reduce their turnover rate.
• We continued to utilise logistics controls 
in 2016 to further reduce the probability 
of theft of mineral concentrate, including 
the use of real-time tracking technology, 
surveillance cameras, guard services and 
control checkpoints in a ‘safe corridor’ 
and reduced authorised stops in order  
to optimise delivery times and minimise 
the convoys’ exposure; on short-haul 
routes no stops are allowed. Certain  
new automatic and rigid truck covers  
are being analysed for transportation.
• We continue to invest in community 
programmes, infrastructure 
improvements and government initiatives 
to support development of lawful  
local communities and discourage 
criminal acts. 
• In order to ensure the security of our 
personnel, access to the San Nicolás  
del Oro prospect remains suspended 
because of the level of insecurity in the 
state of Guerrero.
• We continue to promote reporting  
to authorities amongst our contractors.
• Our cybersecurity strategy seeks to 
ensure that our networks, systems and 
data are secured in accordance with best 
practices as put forth by the US National 
Institute of Standards and T echnology 
Cybersecurity Framework (NIST CSF) 
and Control Objectives for Information 
and Related T echnologies (COBIT).

rate worsened during  
2016 in half of the regions 
and projects where  
we operate.

This index uses three 
broad themes: level of 
safety and security in

domestic or international 
conflict; and the degree  
of militarisation. Mexico

5. Public perception against mining
Risk description Response/mitigation Risk appetite Link to strategy
Public opinion globally is 
increasingly wary of the potential 
adverse social and environmental 
consequences of mining operations. 
This sentiment is manifested 
through increased regulatory 
obligations for mining companies 
and increased social activism by 
communities and other grassroots 
organisations.
Communities are our strategic partners; 
having their trust requires understanding 
and effective engagement, and being 
accountable for our impact. Our permanent 
programme for community engagement 
includes: 
• Working with communities at an early 
exploration stage to understand their 
needs and communicate the benefits  
of developing and operating a mine  
in terms of social welfare and quality  
of life.
• Conducting regular community 
perception studies across all our 
operating units, the results of which 
enable each of the BUs to update their 
social risks and opportunities, and define 
action plans focused on specific areas of 
value for each community. For 2017 the 
priority will be discussing harmonious 
relocation of certain groups (if required) 
and the implementation of jointly 
defined and approved plans. We now 
utilise an information system to record 
community support and social 
investment, with logs of activities 
organised by the Company and requests 
for contributions, allowing us to better 
track and follow up on our work. 
• Following the guidelines set out by  
the International Finance Corporation 
and the International Council of Mining  
and Metals.
• Continuously developing a portfolio  
of proposals for institutional projects  
and alliances with NGOs. During 2016  
we started an alliance with ECOS 
(biodiversity), and continued working 
with Naturalia (biodiversity and 
communities), IBBY (books for children) 
and Innovec (science education). 
• Monitoring public opinion within local 
and international media (newspapers, 
radio stations, local channels). 
• Collaborating with peers in the 
international and Mexican mining 
community to pursue an industry 
response to this risk.

Description of risk change
We have maintained the 
social license to operate in 
our communities; however, 
public sentiment against 
mining has continued  
to increase. 
There are multiple 
examples of cancelled 
projects after years of 
protests and violent 
clashes in Latin America. 
Local and international 
NGOs are increasingly 
active, aiming to share 
experiences and tactics 
against extractive  
industry projects at 
periodic meetings with 
communities. In addition, 
lawyers in the north  
of Mexico are sharing 
strategies in respect of 
successfully cancelled or 
temporarily suspended 
projects, thus we believe 
likelihood in the perceived 
level of this risk has 
increased. 48

6. Safety
Risk description Response/mitigation Risk appetite Link to strategy
Inherent to our industry is the risk  
of incidents due to unsafe acts  
or conditions that lead to injuries  
or fatalities.
Our people face risks such as  
fire, explosion, electrocution and 
carbon monoxide poisoning, as  
well as risks specific to each mine 
site and development projects such  
as rock falls caused by geological 
conditions, cyanide contamination, 
and heavy or light equipment 
collisions between other machinery 
or involving personnel.
Our safety performance regrettably 
deteriorated in 2016, thus we have  
redoubled our efforts in the pursuit  
of our strategic safety goals. We are 
committed to offering a safe workplace  
to our workers and contractors; and  
a safety culture where our personnel  
and contractors have the knowledge, 
competence and desire to work safely.
Our priorities for 2017 are: 
• Continue working towards zero fatalities.
• 20% reduction in the accident rate in all 
our operations.
Our strategy consists of:
• Managing our knowledge of safety 
through identifying and analysing risks, 
evaluating controls, performing situational 
assessments and monitoring performance.
• Engaging our stakeholders through the 
‘No more accidents’ process, which has 
become a permanent effort to reinforce 
the safety culture, and includes the 
following programmes and initiatives: 
‘Leaders for Safety’, ‘Behavioural  
Change’, ‘Operational Discipline’, ‘Rules 
that Save Lives,’ and comprehensive 
accident investigation. 
• Launching initiatives to embed safety  
in our culture. Safety culture is routinely 
monitored to assess the attitudes, 
behaviours and disciplined elimination  
of unsafe conditions. We have launched  
a new initiative called ‘Safety folder’  
to improve compliance and monitoring  
of safety behaviour. 
The T otal Recordable Injury Frequency rate 
decreased to 16.93 in 2016 (vs. 26.84 in 2015) 
and the Lost Time Injury Frequency Rate 
decreased to 5.99 (vs. 7.51 in 2015). 
We continue to deliver training for both 
employees and contractors. Personnel 
received an average of 89 hours of training  
in 2016. 50 of the 89 hours were in relation to 
HSECR training, of which 41 related to safety. 
See Safety pages 82-84 for more on our 
safety strategy and programmes.

7. Projects (performance risk)
Risk description Response/mitigation Risk appetite Link to strategy
Pursuing advanced exploration  
and development opportunities, 
which are core to meeting our 
strategic goals, carry certain 
project-related risks:
• Economic viability: impact  
of capital cost to develop and 
maintain the mine, future metal 
prices and operating costs 
through the mine’s life cycle.
• Uncertainties associated with 
developing and operating new 
mines and expansion projects: 
fluctuations in ore grade and 
recovery, unforeseen complexities 
in the mining process, poor rock 
quality, unexpected presence  
of underground water or lack 
thereof, lack of community 
support and inability to  
obtain and maintain required 
operating permits.
• Delivery risk: projects may go 
over budget in terms of cost and 
time, or may not be constructed 
in accordance with the required 
specifications, or major mining 
equipment may not be delivered 
on time.
Our investment evaluation process 
determines how to best direct available 
capital using technical, financial and 
qualitative criteria.
• T echnical: we assess the resource 
estimate and confirmed resources, 
metallurgy of the mineral bodies, 
investment required in general 
infrastructure (e.g. roads, power, general 
services, housing) and infrastructure 
required for the mine and plant.
• Financial: we look at risk relative to return 
for proposed investments of capital. We 
set expected internal rates of return (IRR) 
per project as thresholds for approving 
the allocation of capital based on the 
present value of expected cash flows 
from the invested capital.
• Qualitative factors: e.g. alignment of the 
investment with our strategic plan and 
business model; synergies with other 
investments and operating assets; 
implications for safety, security, people, 
resourcing and community relations.
We closely monitor project controls to 
ensure that we deliver approved projects  
on time, on budget and as per the defined 
specifications. The Executive Management 
team and Board of Directors are regularly 
updated on progress. Each advanced 
exploration project and major capital 
development project has a risk register 
containing the identified and assessed  
risks specific to the project.
The project development pipeline in  
2017 includes: 
• Completion and commissioning in 2Q 
2017 of phase II of the San Julián project; 
management will continue to closely 
monitor progress, paying particular 
attention to contractor turnover (due to 
the project’s remote location and security 
incidents), as well as delays in the delivery 
of certain equipment that could further 
impact progress. 
• Ongoing construction and development 
of the pyrites plant.
• The Centauro Extension, including a 
second line of the dynamic leaching plant, 
at Herradura.

8. Union relations
Risk description Response/mitigation Risk appetite Link to strategy
Although the risk of union action  
or a deterioration in union relations 
at some sites may be possible, our 
overall union relationship continues 
to strengthen; nonetheless, internal 
union politics could impact us 
negatively, as could pressure  
from other mining unions that  
want to take over the Fresnillo 
labour contract.
Our strategy is to integrate unionised 
personnel into each BU team. T o do so,  
we have clearly assigned responsibilities  
and programmes for maintaining close 
relationships with unions at mine sites and at 
the national level. We have maintained close 
communication with union leaders at various 
levels of the organisation to raise awareness 
about the economic situation the industry  
is facing, to share our production results  
and to encourage their participation in  
our initiatives regarding safety and other 
operational improvements (such as the 
safety guardians programme, alliances  
for obtaining certifications, integration of 
high productivity teams, family integration 
activities, etc.).
We are proactive and timely in our responses 
to the needs of the unions, and experienced 
no labour-related work stoppages in 2016. 
If required, we engage experienced  
legal counsel, both internal and external,  
to support us on labour issues. We will  
continue to closely monitor union and  
labour developments.

9. Exploration
Risk description Response/mitigation Risk appetite Link to strategy
We are highly dependent on  
the success of the exploration 
programme to meet our strategic 
value-creation targets and  
our long-term production and 
reserve goals.
Risk factors that may impact 
prospecting and converting inferred 
resources, apart from the growing 
level of insecurity and access to  
land detailed in previous risks, 
include not having a robust portfolio 
of prospects in our pipeline with 
sufficient potential in terms of 
indicated and inferred resources  
and insufficient concession coverage 
in target areas.
We also risk the loss of purchase 
opportunities due to insufficient 
speed in decision making. 
As our production escalates and 
more mines approach the end of 
their lives, it becomes increasingly 
challenging to replenish reserves.
Risk capital invested in exploration in 2016 
totalled US$137.9 million, below budget; this 
was in accordance with the Group’s decision 
to reduce exploration expenditure in light of 
current market conditions. Our exploration 
objectives for 2017 include a budgeted risk 
capital invested in exploration of 
approximately US$160 million, with the 
approximate spending split of 36% for 
operating mines, 22% for exploration projects 
and the remaining 42% for prospects, 
regional prospecting and mining rights. 
Our measures also include:
• A focus on increasing regional exploration 
drilling programmes to intensify efforts  
in the districts with high potential.
• For local exploration, aggressive in-field 
exploration to upgrade the resources 
category and convert inferred resources 
into reserves.
• A team of highly trained and motivated 
geologists, both employees and long-
term contractors.
• Advisory technical reviews by international 
third party experts, up-to-date and 
integrated GIS databases, remote sensing 
imagery and software for identifying 
favourable metallogenic belts and districts 
to be field-checked by the team.
• Drill-ready high priority projects.
During 2016 we revised our portfolio of 
concessions and determined that some  
did not meet our criteria for continued 
investment; thus we voluntarily relinquished 
231,266 hectares in order to focus our efforts 
on areas of greater potential.

10. Human Resources
Risk description Response/mitigation Risk appetite Link to strategy
Our people are critical to delivering 
our objectives. We face risks in 
selecting, recruiting, training and 
retaining the people we need.
A lack of reliable contractors with 
sufficient infrastructure, machinery, 
track records of performance and 
skilled people is also a risk that 
might affect our ability to develop 
and construct mining works.
Recruitment: We assessed our hiring 
requirements for key positions for 2017,  
and aim to meet openings through internal 
training and promotion, and by recruitment 
through:
• Our close relationships with universities 
offering earth sciences programmes  
(we have dedicated programmes to 
identify potential candidates based  
on performance who may be hired as 
interns and/or employees on graduation). 
• CETEF (Centre for T echnical Studies 
Fresnillo) which teaches specific mining 
operational skills; all the 12 graduates  
from 2016 joined the Company as 
full-time employees. 
• CETLAR (the Peñoles Centre for 
T echnical Studies) which trains mechanics 
and electrical technicians; all seven  
of the 2016 graduates (designated  
for Fresnillo BUs) joined the Company  
as full-time employees. 
Retention: We provide a stable labour 
environment, strong corporate culture 
committed to our people, good working 
conditions, competitive benefits and career 
development opportunities. In 2015, Fresnillo 
plc was recognised by the Great Place to 
Work® Institute, and it currently ranks 17th  
in Mexico among companies with more than 
5,000 employees; results of the 2016 survey 
will be released in 2017.
Performance: We have strengthened the 
maturity of our performance evaluation 
process, reinforcing formal feedback. We 
promote certification of key technical skills for

Risk description Response/mitigation Risk appetite Link to strategy
Inherent to our industry is the risk  
of environmental incidents such as 
overflow/collapse of tailings dams, 
cyanide spills and dust emissions, 
among others, any of which could 
have a high potential impact on our 
people, communities and business.
Our environmental management system 
ensures effective compliance with Mexican 
regulations, transparency and supports 
initiatives that reduce our environmental 
footprint. We disclose our performance in 
the water and climate change programmes 
of the Carbon Disclosure Project. See 
‘Environment’ pages 86-88 for more  
results on our environmental strategy  
and indicators. 
All our mining units are certified under ISO 
14001 and have Clean Industry certification 
except for Saucito; in this case the course of 
action has changed because we are pursuing 
an integrated certification with OSHAS:18001 
(Occupational Health and Safety Series); we 
have advanced 90% towards obtaining both.
The Herradura mine is certified in the 
International Cyanide Management Code 
while at Ciénega the process is on hold, set 
to resume once expansion at the processing 
plant is complete. Noche Buena also 
obtained this same certification in 2016.
We rigorously adhere to the requirements 
established by each project’s environmental 
permit (Environmental Impact Statement 
issued by the Ministry of Environment,

Fresnillo plc Annual Report 2016
The Directors reviewed the viability period 
and confirmed that a five-year period to 
December 2021 remained suitable, in line 
with the nature of planning in the mining 
industry and the Company’s five-year 
forecast period normally used to evaluate 
liquidity and contingency plans which is 
important given that Fresnillo’s business 
activities cover the full value chain from 
exploration to mine operation. It allows  
for modelling of capital expenditure and 
development programmes planned during 
the timeframe and reflecting cash flows 
generated by the projects currently under 
development. Due to the long business 
cycles in the mining industry, the Directors 
considered that a shorter time period 
would be insufficient.
Reporting on the Company’s viability 
requires the Directors to consider those 
principal risks that could impair the 
solvency and liquidity of the Company.  
In order to determine those risks, the 
Directors robustly assessed the Group-
wide principal risks and operation-specific 
risks by undertaking consultations with 
Executive Management, mine managers 
and other personnel across the operations. 
Through these conversations, the Directors 
also identified low probability, high loss 
scenarios – ‘singular events’ – with the 
potential magnitude to severely impact  
the solvency and/or liquidity of Fresnillo.
For the purpose of assessing the Group’s 
viability, the Directors identified that of  
the final principal risks detailed on page 43,  
the following are the most important to the 
assessment of the viability of the Group:
A. ‘Impact of global macroeconomic 
developments’, specifically volatility 
in the prices of gold and silver over  
a period of time.
B. Access to land.
C. ‘Potential actions by the government’ 
which could include a delay in  
obtaining permits and/or new  
restrictive regulations.
D. Environmental incidents.
Viability Statement
In accordance with provision C.2.2 of the UK Corporate 
Governance Code, and taking into account the Group’s 
current position and its principal risks for a period longer 
than the 12 months required by the going concern 
statement, a team appointed by the Board prepared the 
viability assessment. This team included two designated 
Directors, the CEO, the CFO, the COO, Head of Business 
Planning and Head of Risk, with the Audit Committee 
being consulted throughout the process.
Scenario 1 
Impact of global 
macroeconomic developments
Over a period of a year, precious metal 
prices fall and then remain at a low  
level for the following four years of  
the viability period varying between 
US$1,108 – 1,171 per oz gold and US$15.4 
– 18.0 per oz silver. T o create this 
impartial projection for the future low 
metal price environment, an average  
of the three lowest forecasts from  
each year of the assessment were  
used, based on consensus estimates 
published by institutional financial 
analysts. This low metal price 
environment was deemed to be the 
most significant risk and pervasive 
across the Company. (Principal risk A)
Scenario 2
Bench collapse at an open  
pit mine
A landslide occurs covering the lower 
pit of one of our mines. Due to the 
unexpected nature of the event, 
fatalities occur. Production is gradually 
ramped back up and re-established  
to full capacity. (Singular event)
Scenario 3
Tailings dam breach at a mine
A tailings dam collapses and tailings  
are released into the surrounding area, 
causing environmental damage. A fund 
is created by the Company to be used 
to remediate and compensate for any 
damages caused. The investigation  
into the causes of the event is drawn 
out and further time is needed for all 
environmental permits to be reinstated. 
As a result, the mine remains closed 
throughout the viability assessment 
period. (Principal risk D)
Scenario 4
Flooding at a mine
An unforeseen fault containing water  
is cut into, with water then entering  
the mine in excess of pumping  
capacity, thereby halting production. 
The ramp-up to pre-event production 
levels commences once management 
determines that it is safe to do so. 
(Singular event)
Scenario 5
Action by the Government  
at a mine
Explosives are stolen on site causing 
authorities to suspend the explosives 
permit at the mine. Production is halted 
at the mine whilst an investigation  
into the matter is completed. Once 
permits have been restored, production 
ramps back up to pre-event levels. 
(Principal risk C)
Scenario 6
Access to land at a mine
Conflicts with local communities arise 
resulting in the Company having to 
cease operations, until negotiations 
can be finalised and the land can be 
re-occupied. (Principal risk B)
Scenario 7
San Julián suspension due  
to Government actions
Three members of the local community 
are poisoned due to a cyanide tank 
rupturing. The pressure mounted by 
social activism resulted in the Mexican 
government withdrawing all permits  
with no intention of re-installing them in 
the future. This leads to the permanent 
closure of the San Julián mine for the 
duration of the viability period, while 
mitigating actions can be established. 
(Principal risks C and D)
It was determined that none of the 
individual risks would in isolation 
compromise the Group’s viability. The 
Directors therefore went on to group 
principal risks into the following severe 
but plausible scenarios, in each case 
determining the risk proximity (how  
soon could the risk occur) and velocity 
(the speed with which the impact of  
a risk will be felt): 55
Fresnillo plc Annual Report 2016
FRESNILLO TODAY STRATEGIC REPORT CORPORATE GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
The above scenarios are hypothetical  
and extremely severe for the purpose of 
creating outcomes that have the ability  
to threaten the viability of the Group; 
however, multiple control measures are  
in place to prevent and mitigate any such 
occurrences from taking place. In the case 
of these scenarios arising, various options 
are available to the Company in order  
to maintain liquidity so as to continue in 
operation. When quantifying the expected 
financial impact and remediation time 
period for each of the risks on the  
viability of the Group, management 
performed benchmarking against its own 
experience and against publicly available 
information on relevant similar incidents  
in the mining industry.
All scenarios were first evaluated using 
average metal prices 
1
, and once the 
mitigation plans had been applied where 
necessary, there was no threat to the 
viability of the Company. T o create a  
more stringent test and further challenge 
the resilience of the Group, all scenarios 
were then overlaid with scenario 1, (low 
metal prices) and then re-evaluated.
After these had been modelled, none of 
the scenarios foresee an extremely low  
or negative cash balance. The strong cash 
balance at the end of 2016 (US$912 million) 
approximately 80% higher than the 
Going Concern Statement
The Group’s business activities, together 
with the factors likely to affect its future 
development, performance and position 
are set out in the Strategic Review on 
pages 16-111. The financial position of the 
Group, its cash flows and liquidity position 
are described in the Financial Review  
on pages 100-111. In addition, note 31  
to the financial statements includes the 
Group’s objectives, policies and processes 
for managing its capital; its financial  
risk management objectives; details  
of its financial instruments and hedging 
activities; and its exposures to credit risk 
and liquidity risk.
In making their assessment of the  
Group’s ability to manage its future  
cash requirements, the Directors have 
considered the Company and Group 
budgets and the cash flow forecast  
for the period to 31 December 2018.  
In addition, they reviewed a more 
conservative cashflow scenario with 
reduced silver and gold prices of US$15.6/
oz and US$1,111/oz respectively throughout 
this period, whilst maintaining current 
budgeted expenditure while only 
considering projects approved by the 
Executive Committee. This resulted in  
our current cash balances reducing over 
time but maintaining ample liquidity 
throughout the period.
The Directors have further calculated 
prices (US$12.2 and US$841 for silver  
and gold, respectively), which should  
they prevail to the end of 2018 would 
result in cash balances decreasing  
to minimal levels by the end of 2018, 
without applying mitigations.
Should metal prices remain below the 
stressed prices above for an extended 
period, management have identified 
specific elements of capital and 
exploration expenditures which could  
be deferred without adversely affecting 
production profiles throughout the period. 
Finally, management could amend the 
mining plans to concentrate on 
production with a higher margin in order 
to accelerate cash generation without 
affecting the integrity of the mine plans.
After reviewing all of the above 
considerations, the Directors have a 
reasonable expectation that management 
have sufficient flexibility in adverse 
circumstances to maintain adequate 
resources to continue in operational 
existence for the foreseeable future.  
The Directors, therefore, continue to 
adopt the going concern basis of 
accounting in preparing the annual 
financial statements.
If the necessity arose to employ any or all 
of the above mitigations for an extended 
period of time, it may be that these could 
impact the Group’s ability to achieve its 
targets for production and/or reserves  
by 2018.
previous year, positioned Fresnillo plc in 
a healthy financial situation. In addition, 
current macroeconomic conditions,  
higher metal prices in scenario 1 and  
the overlaid scenarios, and a depreciated 
exchange rate (MXN/USD) enhance  
the cash balance position across the 
scenarios assessed. 
The lowest cash balance level was 
identified in scenario 2 in combination  
with the low metal prices scenario; 
notwithstanding, a positive cash balance 
would be maintained in this scenario 
throughout the viability period with a 
minimum level of US$278 million during 
the third year (2019), thereby not requiring 
any mitigating actions to be taken.  
Strong risk management and internal 
control systems are in place (page 42) 
throughout the Group. Through the 
internal control systems, the Directors 
monitor key variables that have the ability 
to impact the liquidity and solvency of  
the Group, and we are confident that 
management is able to sufficiently mitigate 
any situations as they might occur.
Certain actions for the reinforcement  
of controls and their monitoring that  
were identified last year as a result of this 
assessment continue to be implemented to 
further strengthen the control environment. 
A Crisis Committee is part of the risk 
mitigation and control measures that the 
Group has in place in case an event of such 
magnitude should occur. These measures 
also include the briefing and convening  
of the Board of Directors as necessary  
to respond to events as they develop. 
Dedicated personnel for managing media, 
engaging with authorities and other 
stakeholders are appointed at each level  
of the organisation depending on the 
magnitude of the crisis.
Based on the results from this robust 
analysis, and having considered the 
established controls for the risks and the 
available mitigating actions, the Directors 
have a reasonable expectation that the 
Group will be able to continue in operation 
and meet its liabilities as they fall due over 
the five-year period of their detailed 
assessment. This longer-term assessment 
process supports the Directors’ statements 
on both viability, as set out above, and 
going concern, made below.

Information T echnology
T echnology and cybersecurity as a competitive advantage
T echnology has changed the way every business operates, including the mining industry. Increased 
productivity, reduced costs, improved safety and enhanced decision-making are among the many 
benefits. T o secure a competitive advantage, we must continuously adapt and embrace innovation 
and secure our networks, systems and data. Whilst cybersecurity has not risen to the level of 
a key risk, it continues to merit ongoing management oversight and review. 
IT governance
T o better prepare and help guide the Group through a process of digital transformation, we have created an IT Governance Committee, 
chaired by the Chief Executive Officer, to steer discussions on innovation and performance at a strategic level, provide macro-level insights 
into technology for mining, map out technology strategy execution and oversee cybersecurity protocols. 
The main responsibilities of this Committee are to: 
• Review technology options for business process innovation.
• Select the best technology, ensure alignment with business strategy and prioritise projects.
• Strengthen cybersecurity framework and protocols.
• Develop and oversee a technology implementation budget.
• Reward results not activities.
Cybersecurity
We recognise the importance of confidentiality, continuity, integrity and security of our data and production systems. Whilst cybersecurity 
has not risen to the level of a key risk, it continues to merit ongoing management oversight and review. A third party cybersecurity 
assessment in 2016 identified certain gaps and weaknesses that should be addressed, indicating the need for a formal cybersecurity 
strategy, now under development, with dedicated specialists being selected.
Our approach incorporates: (i) the US National Institute of Standards and T echnology Cybersecurity Framework (NIST CSF) which 
provides a policy framework of computer security guidance for how private sector organisations can assess and improve their ability to 
prevent, detect and respond to cyber attacks; and (ii) Control Objectives for Information and Related T echnologies (COBIT), a framework 
created by ISACA, the international professional association for IT management and governance that provides an implementable set of 
controls over IT and organises them around a logical framework of IT-related processes and enablers.
At year end 2016, we estimated our NIST rating was 0.9 out of 4.0, compared to an Expected Industry Level rating of 2.7. A work plan  
to achieve that rating is well underway and expected to be complete by 1Q 2018. The following areas have already been addressed:
• Disaster recovery protocols: automated backups and alternate site creation for every data room in each business unit.
• Hardening: secure access configurations to servers, databases and applications; next generation hardware and software;  
built-in security for all devices and systems.
• Network access: automated access policy management.
• Network perimeter security: hacker protection tools.
Our IT model
T o support the Group’s value creation model, our IT efforts are focused on three main areas:
• Execution: technologies that can reduce costs and increase productivity and throughput.
• Innovation: disruptive technologies and paradigm shifts.
• Decision-making: data analytics and automatic insight generation.
We believe that employees are best equipped to identify opportunities for improvement within their function areas or business units. 
Our ‘Make IT happen!’ initiative was created to foster ideas, innovation and communication about such opportunities; employees 
generated more than 120 ideas, and seven projects were ultimately selected by the IT Governance Committee for a five-year 
implementation roadmap (2014-2018). These related to the basic capabilities of a mining operation such as personnel and equipment 
tracking, proximity-warning systems and ventilation on-demand; intelligent plants (process automation and optimisation; intelligent 
maintenance (predictive maintenance through big data analysis); and business intelligence: single-version-of-the-truth data. 
In 2016, the total investment in technology was US$16.1 million, of which US$7.8 million was related to these projects. 57

Fresnillo
Fresnillo is one of the 
world’s oldest continuously 
operating mines; it 
produced 32% of the 
Group’s total silver in 2016 
and generated 18.7% of 
total adjusted revenue. 
Key developments in the year
Silver production increased 1.6% over  
2015 as a result of regained access to 
higher grade veins at the San Alberto and 
San Carlos areas, offset by lower volume  
of ore processed. This was due to reduced 
availability of equipment and a temporary 
shortage of skilled personnel in the second 
and third quarters of the year. 
We continued to see an improvement  
in the grades and production levels 
compared to 2015, although at a slower 
pace than planned. Silver ore grade 
averaged 227 g/t in 2016, below the 
anticipated 240 g/t, due to the extraction 
of ore at stopes with higher zinc content 
but lower silver grades. This was the result 
of the natural increase of zinc grades at the 
deeper areas of the mine and the limited 
flexibility to mine. 
Development reached a rate of 4,500 
metres per month at the beginning of  
the year but the lack of necessary 
infrastructure resulted in the reallocation  
of resources to address this issue; thus 
development rates were scaled back  
to an annual average of 3,929 metres per 
month. Notwithstanding, dilution rates 
improved in 2016. For 2017, we expect  
that development rates will again increase  
to 4,500 metres per month and reach  
a sustained rate of 4,800 metres per  
month by year end, with an increase  
in ore throughput of approximately 5%,  
an average silver ore grade of around  
230 g/t, and a 7-10% increase in silver 
production at this mine. 
The optimisation project to increase  
plant capacity to 9,000 tonnes per day 
moved forward in the year. We continued 
to evaluate the optimal layout for 
additional flotation cells and the zinc 
thickener, which will process higher zinc 
grades found at depth and thereby 
maximise recovery rates. This, together 
with the installation of vibrating screens,  
is expected to result in additional annual 
average production of three moz of silver 
once commissioned in 2019.
The increase in silver contained in mineral 
resources was generated by positive 
exploration results at lower silver grades 
and a lower cut-off grade. Silver contained 
in ore reserves increased slightly, with ore 
grade decreasing as a reflection of lower 
exploration grades and cut-off grades.
Capital expenditures
T otal capex allocation in 2016 was 
US$52.8 million, mainly for mine 
development, sustaining capex and hoist 
and conveyor equipment for the San 
Carlos shaft deepening. In 2017, capex  
will largely be allocated to mining works, 
sustaining capex and ongoing deepening 
of the San Carlos shaft, which will reduce 
haulage costs and increase access to ore 
reserves at deeper levels of the mine.
Adjusted revenue, excluding inter-segment 
sales, increased 20.1% to US$382.7 million 
due to the 10.3% increase in our realised 
price of silver.
Productivity decreased due to the lower 
volume of ore processed, combined with 
higher number of personnel brought in to 
increase preparation and development at 
the mine. Cost per tonne decreased 8.9%  
to US$43.9 in 2016 mainly as a result of the  59

to increase development rate to 
4,800 metres per month.
• Commence work on plant 
optimisation.
• Continue deepening of San Carlos 
shaft.
• Continue tailings dam expansion.
17 .7% devaluation of the Mexican peso/ 
US dollar exchange rate and lower diesel 
and electricity prices, together with lower 
maintenance costs resulting from the 
maintenance delays; and a decrease in the 
cost of operating materials mainly due to 
lower consumption of steel balls and liners 
for the mill. This was partly offset by higher 
contractor costs resulting from the increased 
number of contractors hired to accelerate 
development and preparation of the mine; 
and higher personnel costs due to increased 
headcount and the 5% rise in wages in 
Mexican pesos to unionised personnel.

Saucito
Saucito is one of the 
Group’s most important 
assets, contributing 44%  
to total silver production in 
2016 and generating 25.8% 
of total adjusted revenue.
Key developments in the year
Annual silver production remained stable 
at 21.9 million ounces in 2016. This was 
mainly due to higher volumes of ore 
processed from the Jarillas West and 
Central areas, and increased milling 
capacity following the installation of  
the vibrating screens and other minor 
technology improvements at the Saucito II 
plant, allowing it to reach a processing 
capacity of 7,800 tonnes per day by year 
end, exceeding out 2016 objective of 7,500 
tonnes per day. These factors more than 
offset the expected return to normal silver 
ore grades after mining extraordinarily  
high grade ore from the Mesquite vein and 
exhausting the high grade development 
ore during 2015. 
Silver reserves decreased as a result  
of less infill drilling as more time was 
assigned to parametric drilling to increase 
resources. Silver grades decreased due  
to mineralisation containing lower silver 
grades and higher base metal grades. Gold 
reserves and resources increased due to 
additional gold found in the Jarillas vein. 
The 2017 drilling programme is focused  
on a balance of further resource generation 
and of infill drilling aimed at upgrading  
the resource category into reserves.
The deepening of the Jarillas shaft from 
630 metres to 1,000 metres is expected  
to commence in 2H 2017. This project aims 
to provide access to the deeper reserves  
in the Jarillas vein. In addition, development 
rates are expected to increase to 4,000 
tpd so as to install additional ramps and 
prepare future production areas.
Capital expenditures
Capital expenditures in 2016 totalled 
US$102.4 million, primarily allocated to 
in-mine development and sustaining capex, 
the installation of the vibrating screens at 
Saucito II, construction of the Pyrites plant 
and deepening of the Jarillas shaft. In 2017, 
capex will primarily be allocated to the 
ongoing increase of development rates, 
deepening of the Jarillas shaft and the 
construction of the Pyrites plant 
(see page 70).
Adjusted revenues at Saucito increased  
by 12.7% to US$528.0 million mainly as a 
result of the higher precious metal prices. 
The mine’s contribution in consolidated 
silver revenues contributed 48.5% in 2016 
(2015: 51.3%), but remained as the main 
contributor to consolidated silver revenues. 
Gold remains an important revenue driver 
for the mine, contributing 18.5% to Saucito’s 
revenue (2015: 18.5%) and representing 
8.6% of the Group’s gold revenues.
Despite the 12.7% increase in ore milled, 
productivity decreased in the year as a 
result of the greater number of workers 
and contractors hired to increase 
preparation and development rates.
Cost per tonne decreased 13.4%  
to US$36.8 mainly as a result of the 
favourable effect of the exchange rate, 
the economies of scale obtained from the 
increased ore throughput and to a lesser 
extent, the lower diesel and electricity 
prices, lower maintenance costs and a 
decrease in the cost of operating materials.  61

Pyrites plant.
• Deepening of the Jarillas shaft.
• Convert resources into reserves.
• Obtain integrated ISO 14001/OHSAS 
18001 certification and Clean 
Industry certification.
This was partly offset by increased 
development recorded as costs in the 
income statement, whereas in 2015 a 
greater portion was capitalised; as well  
as a larger number of contractors and 
personnel to increase development rates 
and volumes of ore hauled.
Cash cost per silver ounce decreased  
to -US$0.4 per ounce (2015: US$1.2 per 
silver ounce) due to the by-product credits. 
Margin per ounce increased to US$17.6 
in 2016 (2015: US$14.4), whilst expressed

Ciénega
Ciénega is a gold mine with 
a strong secondary profile 
in silver.
Key developments in the year
Annual gold production decreased 15.0% 
as a result of the anticipated depletion of 
higher ore grade veins at the main Ciénega 
mine, lower gold grades at the Rosario  
and Las Casas veins, increased dilution  
due to narrower veins, and a 4.1% decrease 
in ore processed. The latter was due to  
the extraction of harder mineral from  
the Rosario, Las Casas and Carmen areas, 
and the dismissal of a contractor at the 
beginning of the year following a fatal 
accident. Silver production increased 6.3% 
due to increased development ore from 
the Rosario and Las Casas areas, and 
higher silver grades in those veins.
The development programme at the 
Rosario and Las Casas veins was intensified 
with 537,000 tonnes of ore being 
processed at Ciénega in 2016, and an 
additional 88,000 tonnes from the T aspana 
and T ajos veins in the Cebollitas Cluster 
within the Ciénega District. Following 
positive exploration results from these 
veins, we intend to intensify their 
exploration and development in 2017 and 
will also initiate an exploration programme 
at the Manzanillas Cluster. These activities 
will help us to define the optimal milling 
capacity as well as determine the location 
for a possible expansion in this District (see 
detailed exploration results on page 73). 
We expanded capacity by 2.5 million cubic 
metres at the second tailings dam in 2016 
to support the operations for an additional 
two years. Construction of the third tailings 
dam is expected to commence in 2017 
once permits have been obtained. 
Gold reserves increased as a result of 
further drilling in the Rosario and Casas 
area. Gold and silver resources increased  
as a result of exploration efforts in the 
Rosario transversal and T aspana veins. 
Capital expenditures
Capex in 2016 included development, 
sustaining capex and expansion of the 
tailings dam. Budgeted capex for 2017 
will mainly be allocated to mining works, 
sustaining capex, construction of the  
third tailings dam, and safety and 
environmental spending.
Adjusted revenue increased to US$185.0 
million in 2016 due mainly to higher prices 
of all metals, and increased volumes of 
silver, lead and zinc sold, offset by the 
lower volumes of gold sold. Ciénega  
is the Group’s most polymetallic mine,  
as evidenced by the 54.7% contribution  
from silver, lead and zinc (2015: 47.9%).
Productivity decreased as a result of  
the lower volumes of ore processed and  
a greater number of contractors doing 
non-productive work. Cost per tonne  
at Ciénega decreased 11.9% to US$55.5,  63

Key developments in the year
Annual gold production increased 30.5% 
as a result of reducing inventories at the 
pads to 72 koz of gold. This reduction  
was possible through the commissioning 
of the second Merrill Crowe Plant in the 
DLP during 4Q 2015, which enabled the 
elimination of the bottleneck in processing 
volumes of rich solution coming from the 
leaching pads and the DLP. 
We believe the year end inventory on the 
pads of 72 koz of gold is the optimal level 
that balances efficiency of the leaching 
process and production costs. No further 
decreases are expected in 2017, thus a 
decrease in gold production compared  
to 2016 is anticipated.
The construction of the second line at the 
DLP was approved, with commissioning 
expected in 2018. This US$110 million 
project will increase efficiency as sulphides 
found deeper in the pit are processed. 
Mining work continued at the Valles 
underground pilot mine with good results.
Gold ore grades in 2017 are expected to 
average 0.72 g/t. This is expected to 
decrease in subsequent years to 0.64 g/t 
as a higher volume of lower ore grade 
material, deriving from the pit expansion,  
is processed, with small fluctuations 
expected depending on the timing of the 
Centauro Deep project, after which gold 
ore grades will gradually increase again.
Gold reserves were stable, while gold 
resources increased as a result of 
exploration and geological modelling 
efforts, including resources from the 
Centauro Deep underground project. 
Ongoing work continues to upgrade  
the larger resource base into reserves.
Capital expenditures
Capital expenditures in 2016 totalled 
US$78.8 million, which included mining 
works, sustaining capex, expansion of the 
second tailings dam and construction of 
the second line at the DLP. Capex for 2017 
will mainly be focused on mining works, 
sustaining capex, construction of additional 
leaching pads, the second line at the DLP, 
and land acquisition.
Adjusted revenue increased 47.1% to 
US$656.1 million reflecting the 34.3% 
increase in volumes of gold sold; and to  
a lesser extent, the 10.7% increase in the 
realised gold price.
Productivity increased compared to the 
previous year due to increased volumes of 
ore and waste hauled by fewer personnel, 
whereas in 2015, ore was deposited at a 
slower pace to optimise inventory levels at 
the pads given the temporary processing 
capacity constraints.
Cost per tonne of ore deposited decreased 
10.9% to US$7.7 due mainly to the 
favourable effect of the devaluation of the 
Mexican peso and the decline in unit costs 
of operating materials, together with the 
additional efficiencies achieved from 
the increased ore throughput, the  
lower maintenance costs and the lower 
energy costs.
Cash cost per gold ounce was US$470.7, 
which represented a slight decrease over 
2015. Margin per ounce increased 18.6%  
to US$775.8, whilst margin expressed

Noche 
Buena
We acquired Noche Buena 
in 2008 and commenced 
operations as an open pit 
gold mine in 2012. The mine 
is located in the Herradura 
District 23 kilometres from 
the Herradura mine.
Business unit risks
See Herradura for risks associated with  
all Penmont mines.
Key developments in the year
Annual gold production increased 15.2% 
over 2015 due to a higher overall speed of 
recovery resulting from new mineral layers 
at the leaching pads in conjunction with 
the higher ore grade.
We remained focused on improving 
efficiency and reducing costs, which 
included increasing the useful lifetime  
of vehicle components and tyres  
through enhanced monitoring and 
preventive measures. 
In 2017, it is expected that the average gold 
ore grade at Noche Buena will be around 
0.49 g/t. Ore grades through the life of  
the mine are expected to average 0.51 g/t.
Gold reserves and resources decreased as 
a result of the natural depletion of the pit.
Capital expenditures
Capital expenditures in 2016 totalled 
US$8.6 million, focused on sustaining 
capex, including the construction of 
leaching pad #6 to guarantee operational 
continuity. Spend in 2017 will also mainly 
be in sustaining capex, including leaching 
pad #7 and the implementation of  
a collision-prevention technology.
Adjusted revenues at Noche Buena 
increased 24.3% to US$225.8 million, 
reflecting the higher volumes of gold  
sold and the higher prices in 2016.
Productivity increased as a result of 
similar volumes of ore and waste material 
moved by fewer personnel. Cost per 
tonne at this mine decreased 5.9% to 
US$7.5 mainly due to the devaluation  
of the Mexican peso and the decrease  
in unit costs of operating materials and 
maintenance of haulage trucks, together 
with the lower cost of diesel. 
This was partly offset by the increased 
consumption of diesel and sodium 
cyanide; and increased contractor costs.
Cash cost per gold ounce decreased 21.3% 
to US$765.9. Margin per ounce increased 
to US$480.6, and margin expressed as a 
percentage of gold price rose from 13.7% 
in 2015 to 38.6% in 2016 (see page 106).

About the project
The San Julián silver-gold project is  
a cornerstone of the Company’s 2018 
production goals. The geological potential 
identified in the region thus far may be 
sufficient to establish a new mining district 
in the future.
The project includes construction of  
two plants: i) a dynamic leaching plant  
to treat ore from the veins, whose design 
capacity of 3,000 tpd has already been  
met and exceeded; and ii) a flotation plant 
with 6,000 tpd capacity to process ore 
from the disseminated body. Average 
commercial production is estimated at 10.3 
moz of silver and 44,000 oz of gold per 
year, once at full capacity for the life of 
mine, with cash costs in the lowest quartile 
of the international cash cost curve.
Description of risks
1. Failures/delays in obtaining environmental permits.
2. Projects that cannot be delivered on time, on 
budget and according to planned specifications.
3. Volatility in the prices of gold and silver over  
a period of time.
4. Economic mineral found within narrow veins being 
difficult to exploit.
5. Inability to obtain necessary water concessions 
due to government control or private interests. 
6. Sensitivity to project profitability due to changes  
in ore grade and metallurgical recovery that may 
affect the viability of the project.
7. Social behaviours or actions by a group of people 
taking a stance against mining in the areas of 
influence of the business unit.
8. The surrounding communities do not provide their 
support or hinder operations due to complaints 
regarding dust, blasting vibrations, water use.
9. Late delivery of key equipment to plant by the 
supplier (mills, pumps, filters).
10. Actions by the union or deterioration in relations 
with the union (other unions related with the 
transportation of concentrates).
11. Environmental incidents that affect the operation 
of the business unit, the health of the community 
(directly or indirectly) and adversely impacts  
the environment.

San 
Julián 69
Fresnillo plc Annual Report 2016
FRESNILLO TODAY STRATEGIC REPORT CORPORATE GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Key developments in 2016
The construction of phase I at the San 
Julián project was completed on budget, 
though at a slight delay due to contractors 
rectifying a problem at the mill. Since 
ramping up, milling capacity surpassed  
the 3,000 tpd design and was achieving 
3,600 tpd by year end. Production above 
planned capacity was achieved through  
a combination of the following factors: 
processing ore from production stopes and 
the stockpiled ore from the pre-operative 
phase; optimisation of the milling process 
with the installation of additional pumps 
for the SAG mill; and closing the drilling 
pattern for blasting, thus reducing the  
size of the material sent for processing. 
Silver production was 2.1 moz, gold 
production was 31,397 oz, both above  
the anticipated production of 2.0 moz  
of silver and 30,000 oz of gold.  
This reflected the ramping up of  
production ahead of plan and the higher 
fourth quarter silver ore grade of 181 g/t  
vs. 175 g/t anticipated for 2H 2016.  
Cost per tonne was US$48.3 and cash 
cost –US$0.47 per silver ounce. Ore 
grades, cost per tonne and cash costs 
in the start-up phase of the mine are 
not representative of performance  
at full capacity. 
A fatality at the beginning of the year 
accelerated and intensified efforts  
to train personnel and develop longer- 
term onboarding procedures for mine 
employees. 
Commissioning of the flotation plant 
(phase II) was delayed from year-end 2016 
to 2Q 2017 as a result of unusually high 
rainfall, high rotation of contractor 
personnel due to the project’s remote 
location and delays in the delivery of 
certain equipment. 
Capex spend in 2016 was US$134.1 million, 
with total spent as of December 2016 
reaching US$479.8 million. The remaining 
US$35.2 million of the budget will be spent  
in 2017.
Social and sustainability highlights
We supported small community 
entrepreneurs and launched the Silver

Capex: US$155.0 million 
About the project
We resumed the Pyrites plant project  
and proceeded with equipment orders 
and construction. This facility is expected 
to improve overall recoveries of gold and 
silver by processing historical and ongoing 
tailings from the Fresnillo and Saucito 
mines, which would have been lost. The 
plant will froth float pyrite concentrates 
that will be leached in a 2,000 tpd 
dynamic leaching plant and Merrill Crowe 
plant to produce precipitates. Production 
is expected to total an average of 3.5 moz 
silver and 13,000 oz gold per year, and 
advances our objective to maximise 
production in the Fresnillo District.
Key developments in 2016
We completed detailed engineering works 
for this project, obtained environmental 
permits, commenced preparation of the 
site and placed orders for major equipment. 
2017 priorities
• Dismantle equipment at current 
tailings plant.
• Continue construction of the  
Pyrites plant.
Business unit risks Description of risks
1. Event which involves a leakage or spillage of 
cyanide or SO 2 which as a result of its chemical 
properties, could generate an event of major 
consequence on the premises of the business  
unit and/or in the nearby area.
2. Inexperience in the operation of a Pyrite flotation 
plant as it is the first time this type of process will 
have been performed.
3. The surrounding communities do not provide  
their support or hinder operations (social license 
for operation) due to community complaints 
regarding operations e.g. dust, blasting vibrations, 
noise, pollution, water use.
4. Risk of incidents during transportation of iron 
concentrate from the Fresnillo tailings plant  
to the leaching plant (possible environmental 
impact to the local communities).
5. The challenge faced in fine grinding to such  
small sizes (10 to 20 microns) to ensure 
metallurgical recovery.
6. Failures/delays in obtaining the required 
environmental permits (e.g. MIA, CUS, ETJ).
7. Limited capacity of electricity supply; with this 
new project the Fresnillo District will reach its limit.

Exploration
Our consistent investment in exploration 
supports a healthy project pipeline, which  
is core to our growth strategy and a key 
element in extending mine life. We rely  
on an experienced team of 80 geologists 
and more than 300 paid local community 
members to carry out our exploration work. 
We routinely apply advanced geospatial, 
geochemical and geophysical technologies 
such as tomographic imaging, high-
resolution satellite imagery, airborne and 
core hyperspectral technologies, and 
hand-held and down-hole instruments  
as an aid to improving the geologic 
interpretations that guide exploratory 
drilling leading to ore discovery.
Focus: Discovery and potential acquisition 
of large, low-cost silver and gold ore 
bodies in Latin America.
Criteria: Minimum potential of 100 moz  
of silver or two moz of gold equivalent; 
strict requirements regarding ore grades, 
metallurgical recoveries, extraction costs, 
environmental impact and community 
support. Prospects in current districts  
are prioritised due to known external risk 
factors and potential of economic benefit 
through shared infrastructure.
Reserves and resources
T o estimate resources and calculate 
reserves, we again used the 2012 edition  
of the JORC code. The gold price used for 
resources and reserves was US$1,250.00 
per oz (US$1,150.00 in 2015); resources in 
open pits were estimated at US$1,400.00 
per oz (US$1,300.00 in 2015) to allow  
for long-term design flexibility. The silver 
price used for resources and reserves  
was US$17.50 per oz (US$15.00 in 2015). 
Gold and silver resources were increased 
due to these price considerations and 
drilling results at our six operations, and  
at the Guanajuato, Juanicipio and Pilarica 
projects. Reserves at the operations 
remained broadly stable, with exploration 
drilling and development replenishing the 
ore mined in the year.
2016 highlights
• T otal risk capital invested in 
exploration was US$137.9 million, 
an 8.9% decrease compared to 2015.
• Exploration was mainly focused  
on areas of influence at current 
operating mines and key 
exploration sites.
2017 outlook
• Risk capital of around US$160 
million was approved for 2017,  
of which about US$8 million is 
estimated to be capitalised, with 
36% of the budget to be spent in 
operating mines, 22% in advanced 
exploration projects and the 
remaining 42% on projects  
and prospects. 3

During 2016, 30,944 metres were drilled resulting in a 33.7% 
and 9.9% increase in gold and silver resources, respectively.  
This was a result of a 38.9% increase in tonnage and a 3.8%  
and 20.8% reduction in the grades of gold and silver, respectively. 
The priorities for 2017 are to continue exploration at depth  
in conjunction with new objectives through a 20,000 metre  
drilling programme. This joint venture with MAG Silver will  
be developed on a stand-alone basis.
Other sites
Coyotes
13,090 metres of drilling was carried out during 2016. Approval

we expect to expand the drilling areas to the east and south  
of the Coyotes vein system. 
Minillas De Santa Rosa
During the year, 16,043 metres were drilled. An option contract 
was signed to explore a 100 hectare claim in the central zone of 
the project whose exploratory drilling has already delivered some

expected; core drilling will explore in detail the vein extensions  
at depth. At the far eastern section of the ore body, mine 
development has reached the Rosario Transversal shoot, which 
continues to show promise. The 2017 objective is to continue  
the drilling programme in order to confirm the continuity of the 
structure at deeper levels where better grades are expected. 
In 2016, a geological evaluation was completed at the Canelas and 
Valle de T opia districts. For 2017, parametric drilling programmes  
in both locations will be implemented once the social and

geochemistry and detailed core and surface geologic mapping, 
aimed at refining the current Lorena vein models. A number  
of sectors showing good exploration potential were identified  
along Lorena, Angeles, and other subsidiary structures. A drill 
programme started in 4Q 2016 collaring 1,825 metres with  
good results. In 2017, drilling campaigns will continue at the  
main Lorena-Angeles zone and elsewhere in the district to fully 
unlock its exploration potential. 
Rodeo District
Ownership: Exploraciones Minera Parrena, S.A. de C. V .  
(100% Fresnillo plc)
Location: Durango
Indicated and inferred resources: 1.3 moz gold, 13.5 moz silver
The project is currently on stand-by while negotiations with 
the communities for acquisition of land surface rights advance.  
As a result, no drilling was carried out. Instead, a district-wide 
prospection programme was undertaken revealing new areas 
containing gold anomalies. Negotiations regarding land access 
will continue into 2017 and when completed, a step-out, infill and 
condemnation drilling programme would then be implemented  
as well as the evaluation of these new target areas.
La Pampa and 
Santo Domingo 
Districts
At the La Pampa and Santo Domingo prospects, the social permits 
were obtained from the communities and environmental impact 
studies were submitted to the authorities. Drilling is expected  
to commence during 1H 2017 at these precious-metals bearing  
veins prospects.
Guazapares District
19,302 metres were drilled in 2016, primarily focused on the Don  
Ese vein in the vicinity of Coeur’s Palmarejo mine. During the year , 
the Guadalupe vein was found to extend into Fresnillo claims, and 
intersections of the La Verde, Nación and Portales veins were also 
hit. Drilling will continue during 2017 aiming to test the exploration 
potential of these veins and develop a resource base. 
Pilarica District
Ownership: 100% Fresnillo plc
Location: Ayacucho, Peru
Indicated and inferred resources: 54.6 moz silver
At the Pilarica prospect, 15,349 metres of drilling was completed 
during 2016 to successfully upgrade and increase the silver 
resource in the near-surface flat-lying mantos. Some drilling also 
tested the Santa Cruz and Machucruz veins. The 2017 programme 
aims at increasing resources in the district by evaluating these 
veins and the mineralisation at the adjacent Achalla prospect. 
A preliminary review of a number of early to advanced stage 
exploration projects was completed in 2016. A database of 
potentially available exploration projects in Argentina was 
developed and prioritised; a systematic review will be  
undertaken in 2017 .  76

Letter from the Chairman of the 
Health, Safety, Environment & Community 
Relations Committee
Our commitment to long-term value 
creation is founded upon responsible 
mining practices. The Health, Safety, 
Environment & Community Relations 
(HSECR) Committee evaluates, on behalf 
of the Board, the Company’s effectiveness 
in meeting the sustainability challenge.
In 2016, the Committee met in accordance 
with its terms of reference, and as part of 
our governance agenda we continued to 
monitor progress made towards reaching 
full maturity of the HSECR System. I am 
very pleased to report that the HSECR 
System has now reached its full maturity  
as planned and audited by PwC. 
Additionally, our Environment, Social and 
Governance (ESG) performance was again 
recognised with the inclusion of Fresnillo 
plc in the STOXX ESG leaders and the 
Ethibel Excellence Investment Register. 
Health & Safety
Although mining is considered a  
high-risk activity, any accidents, injuries  
or occupational illnesses whatsoever 
incurred by the Company’s employees  
or contractors are unacceptable. 
The Company regrets to report three 
fatalities in 2016 and one in early 2017.
The Committee has instructed 
management to take decisive action  
to improve safety. A comprehensive  
Root Cause Analysis has been conducted 
in each case and concrete measures  
have been taken in order to prevent  
similar accidents. 
Health & Safety performance highlights 
include:
• Operational areas continued to develop 
their skills in simulated emergency 
response scenarios, with drills at all 
mining operations.
• Health & Safety departments 
implemented a new IT system to 
enhance monitoring and accountability.
Environment
Environmental stewardship is a 
fundamental component of the  
social license. The Committee monitors 
management’s performance and 
responsiveness in relation to environmental 
challenges. Performance highlights include:
• The Noche Buena mine obtained  
its Cyanide Code certification.
• Penmont obtained the second level 
of the Clean Industry certification.
Community Relations
Community trust, based on mutually 
beneficial relations, is also integral to  
the social license. Mining brings benefits 
and contributes to the development  
of skills in local communities. We expect  
our personnel to engage with such 
communities respectfully, making certain 
that our business practices respect their 
human rights at all times. 
Community relations highlights include:
• A productive second year of 
collaboration with the National 
Autonomous University of Mexico 
(UNAM) Foundation in the provision of 
free dental treatments and prescription 
eyeglasses for our neighbouring 
communities at each of our mines.
• The Company engaged the support  
of municipal authorities for investments 
into infrastructure projects to benefit 
local communities.
Ethical culture
In 2016 the Board assigned the HSECR 
Committee with the task of overseeing  
the Company’s efforts to embed ethics  
and integrity into organisational culture. 
The Committee is following up on this area 
and looks forward to greater involvement 
in this important topic.
In the accompanying report, stakeholders 
are provided with a more detailed view into 
the Company’s overall HSECR efforts and 
performance in 2016. 
The Committee will continue to oversee,  
on behalf of the Board, the important 
mission of reaching our HSECR, culture 
and ethics goals, always striving towards 
excellence in all of these matters.
We extend our deepest condolences to 
the families of the four people who died 
in 2016 and early 2017. We will honour their 
memory by ensuring that safety continues 
to be our utmost priority.
Y ours faithfully,
Arturo Fernández Pérez, 
Chairman
Health, Safety, Environment and 
Community Relations Committee 77
Fresnillo plc Annual Report 2016
FRESNILLO TODAY STRATEGIC REPORT CORPORATE GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Social and Sustainability Report
The Strategic Imperative
We also believe that responsible mining enhances our competitive 
advantages: engaging communities from the earliest stages of 
exploration and development reduces project risk and supports 
asset values; community support and environmental stewardship 
can minimise disruptions and ensure operating continuity; and  
a solid ESG risk profile influences the cost of capital, which is 
essential to balance sheet flexibility.
As outlined herein, our priorities are to eliminate unsafe workplace 
conditions and behaviours; improve and maintain the health of our 
people; minimise the environmental impact of our activities; engage 
with and support the development of our communities; and secure 
the talent pipeline and ensure a fair and ethical workplace. 
Materiality 
Our current KPIs are based on the aforementioned priorities. 
However, to ensure alignment with the outcomes of recent 
materiality assessments amongst our stakeholder groups,  
we are evaluating key performance and progress indicators  
for future reporting.
Non-financial materiality assessments help us better understand 
the relative importance of non-financial issues to the Company  
and its very diverse group of stakeholders, with local, regional  
and global reach. We cannot use a one-size-fits-all approach  
to conducting these assessments, but rather tailor them to the 
profile of the stakeholder considering scope, affiliation and sector 
(for example, local and global investors, NGOs, universities and 
regulators), as well as priority assessments at the local level  
to capture expectations of communities, local authorities,  
informal leaders, employees (unionised and non-unionised)  
and contractors. The outcomes of our materiality assessment  
will continue to guide our sustainability strategy and streamline  
our reporting. Information on matters that are considered of less 
significance and materiality to our stakeholders is available online 
at www.fresnilloplc.com
Global and regional assessment
Note: Material issues in blue, other issues in green.
The fourth pillar of Fresnillo plc’s strategy is sustainable development and  
the responsible operation of our business. The Group’s business model directly 
incorporates sustainable business practices in the value-creation pyramid, as 
our license to operate requires a committed, continuous and integrated focus 
on our people, communities and environment. We believe that mining can and 
should be compatible with expectations of both economic value creation and 
social and environmental performance.

Governance
The Board of Directors, through its Health, Safety, Environment 
and Community Relations (HSECR) Committee, evaluates the 
effectiveness of the Company’s policies, action plans and systems 
regarding HSECR matters. The Committee meets semi-annually 
to review performance and monitor management’s responses to 
key issues. In 2016, the Board assigned the Committee oversight 
responsibility of the initiatives to embed ethics and integrity  
into the organisational culture. A letter from the Chair of the 
Committee precedes this report and provides information  
on their work in the year.
Remuneration for our senior executives takes sustainability 
performance into consideration, specifically in the areas of 
stakeholder relations, teamwork and safety (see Remuneration 
Report on pages 138-153). 
Our sustainability strategy is managed through our HSECR 
Management System, whose maturity is assessed semi-annually 
by PwC on the basis of its strategy, structure, processes,  
people and technology. In 2016, we reached our target  
of a fully-integrated management system.
Human rights 
We respect and support human rights, avoid complicity with 
abuses, address grievances related to our business activities  
where relevant and we do not tolerate human rights violations 
committed by our employees, contractors, or public or private 
security providers acting on our behalf. 
Along with the laws of Mexico that protect human rights, we have 
internal policies and practices to protect the human rights of our 
communities, employees and contractors, and the Fresnillo Plays Fair 
whistleblowing line to report any concerns. Environmental, livelihood 
and other community concerns can be reported through our 
grievance mechanism, or brought to light via our perception studies. 
We are committed to further integrating human rights 
considerations into our business practices in line with the UN 
Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights (UNGPs). 
Our priorities are to:
• Develop a specific Human Rights Policy that builds on our Code 
of Conduct and sustainability policy.
• Provide guidance to our operations and projects on identifying 
and addressing salient human rights risks. 
• Better integrate human rights considerations into key 
community relations processes such as stakeholder 
engagement and the grievance mechanism. 
• Implement human rights due diligence as part of our Social 
Impact Assessments (SIA) or as standalone assessments. 
Corruption: Transparency in government payments
Corruption has been recognised by the United Nations as one  
of the obstacles to effective promotion and protection of human 
rights. Mexico ranked 123/176 in the 2016 Corruption Perception 
Index (CPI) of Transparency International. The Group implements 
anti-bribery and anti-corruption controls, due diligence and ethical 
training for our people and contractors, and government payments 
are reported annually on our website.
Integrated Management System 
Our Integrated Management System is based on ISO 14001  
and OHSAS 18001. It is the primary tool to drive continuous 
improvement and embed safety in our operations, incorporating 
key safety activities and controls such as risk management,  
root cause analysis of accidents, training, operating procedures, 
performance analysis, etc. It also includes software to support our 
assurance reviews and track the progress of action plans resulting 
from deficiencies detected. 
The system also ensures effective compliance with environmental 
regulations and supports initiatives to reduce our environmental 
footprint, implement the Cyanide Code, Mexican Clean Industry 
certification and other best practices. Furthermore, the system 
includes operating procedures to safely manage and monitor 
tailings storage facilities and waste rock piles following best 
practices, and helping our sites comply with applicable regulations 
in Mexico, as well as policies to reduce and reuse non-mineral  
and hazardous waste.

Occupational health
We seek to prevent, detect and treat work-related illnesses 
amongst our employees and contractors.
We have a health baseline for every employee entering the 
workforce, and conduct regular check-ups to help improve their 
health and screen for occupational diseases. Results from each 
health visit are securely recorded online to track and analyse the 
health of employees and contractors over time, and to help inform 
our approach to occupational health going forward.
We utilise Alert-On randomly or methodically, based on the job 
profile, to detect alcohol and drug usage, as well as to evaluate  
the fitness of workers in critical activities such as high elevation 
work or in mine shaft elevators, testing vital signs, vision and 
glucose levels among others. We also monitor blood lead levels  
for those working in areas with risk of exposure. We are pleased  
to announce that no new cases of occupational diseases were 
diagnosed by health authorities during the year. 
Preventive health, wellness and healthier lifestyles
We seek to prevent health-related issues brought on by aging 
and lifestyle choices, such as lack of exercise, smoking and poor 
nutrition. Weight management, a widespread issue in Mexico, 
remains our top priority as obesity may trigger chronic diseases 
such as diabetes and high blood pressure. Our Healthy Lifestyles 
programme supports good dietary habits and the prevention  
and control of obesity-related diseases. Additionally, we offer 
employees the following:
• Influenza vaccinations.
• Vision tests and prescription safety glasses if required.
• Free annual health check-ups for employees over 50.
• Breast and cervical cancer screening for women.
• Access to dental and optometry care, in partnership  
with the National Autonomous University of Mexico  
(UNAM) Foundation.
We launched a campaign to raise awareness of certain diseases  
in 2016.

Safety
Strategic priority
T o eliminate unsafe workplace conditions and behaviours.
Approach
Workplace hazards and risks in our industry include potential  
rock falls, excessive noise, dust, dangerous chemicals, confined 
spaces, high temperatures and errors of judgment with implication 
on safety. Y et we believe that health and safety in the workplace  
is a human right; moreover, a safe workplace is vital to productivity 
and morale, and our safety reputation is a key driver of 
acceptability in our communities. Our approach is to instil a safety 
culture where our workers and contractors have the knowledge, 
competence and desire to work safely. 
We regret to report three fatal injuries in 2016 and one in early 
2017. We are committed to implementing the measures necessary 
to reverse the negative trend in our safety record.

Critical and fatal injuries
For each incident resulting in a critical injury or loss of life, we 
conduct a root cause analysis to understand the underlying factors 
and determine any remedial actions required. With management 
oversight, lessons learnt and outcomes from each accident are 
communicated across our business units to prevent repeats,  
and any critical controls are implemented in a timely manner.  
We are standardising our approach to accident investigation 
through our information system and training sessions.
Risk assessments
We proactively assess and prioritise risks in order to determine 
operating procedures, equipment, training and controls. Our 
situational assessments and legal compliance audits help us 
identify operational non-conformities and to develop specific 
action plans with clear deadlines and accountabilities. In 2016, 
we updated our risk analysis for fire events in underground mines. 
Engaging our stakeholders: No More Accidents 
Leadership and engagement
We expect our managers, union representatives and contractors 
to take a leadership role in our safety culture. Senior staff meet 
regularly to strengthen accountability and ensure sufficient 
funding for preventive measures. Our situational assessments 
evaluate, among other measures, the leadership capabilities  
of our senior staff.
Our entire workforce is represented by formal Health & Safety 
(H&S) Commissions at each business unit, who provide leadership 
in the field by auditing and removing unsafe conditions. H&S 
Commissions also investigate the causes of accidents and 
occupational diseases, determine preventive measures, and 
monitor compliance. Management, unionised employees and 
contractors are represented in these commissions. 
We support our contractors in enrolling in the Mexican Labour 
Ministry’s voluntary Self-Managed Safety Programme, whose main 
objective is to encourage a self-evaluation culture and continuous 
improvement. Contractors self-evaluate compliance with national 
regulations and develop action plans to correct deviations, while 
we audit their action plans. Companies participating in the 
programme can significantly reduce the number of mandated 
safety inspections and certain tax requirements.
Behavioural change
Human factors are responsible for many incidents and accidents: 
rushing, frustration, fatigue and complacency lead to unintentional 
errors that increase the risk of injuries on or off the job. We engage 
our workforce via two programmes:
• STOP (Stop, Think, Observe and Plan), which teaches that  
all accidents can be prevented, promotes risk monitoring for 
all processes and emphasises the responsibility of the chain  
of command to detect and immediately remediate unsafe 
conditions.
• Behavioural Change workshops, facilitated by psychologists 
who provide guidance and counsel on personal issues that 
may lead to distractions and accidents.
Other safety programmes and initiatives
• Operational Discipline, which is structured in phases: making 
sure safety procedures are available, assuring their quality, 
training and communication, evaluation of compliance and 
continuous improvement; our units are currently focusing  
on evaluating compliance with procedures. 
• Rules that Save Lives, part of our effort to embed critical  
rules into our safety culture, with regular reviews, updates  
and reminders in training sessions and group meetings. 
• Safety Folder, an initiative to reinforce controls, follow-up  
and commitment of supervisors and managers at every level  
of the Company.
Safety culture
Our safety culture is routinely monitored to assess the attitudes, 
behaviours and disciplined elimination of unsafe conditions.
Safe cyanide management
Cyanide, widely used in our industry to dissolve gold from its ore 
in a process called cyanide leaching, can in high concentrations 
be toxic to humans and many living organisms. Responsible 
management of cyanide is critical to ensure the safety of  
our people, contractors, neighbouring communities and  
the environment.
We apply strict health and safety measures to prevent any spills 
and exposure of our workforce to cyanide, and train our response 
teams should any incident occur. The Herradura and Noche 
Buena mines are certified in the Cyanide Code, which sets out 
best practices for transporting, storing, using and disposing of 
cyanide, as developed by the International Cyanide Management 
Institute (ICMI). See also ‘Cyanide management: environmental 
aspects’ on page 90.

Environment 
Strategic priority
T o minimise the environmental impact of our activities.
Approach
Mining and processing precious metals, whilst essential 
industries, consume water, disturb land and produce 
waste and greenhouse gases in the ordinary course  
of business. Hence, optimising our use of resources, 
curbing the impact of our activities, and being 
transparent and accountable regarding our 
environmental footprint are crucial to making mining 
sustainable and retaining our social licence to operate. 
We recognise that a clean and sustainable environment 
is integral to the full enjoyment of human rights.
Reporting boundary
The reporting boundary for environmental certifications 
and most KPIs includes the following business units: 
Ciénega, Fresnillo, Saucito and Penmont (Herradura  
and Noche Buena). We expect the San Julián mine will 
be incorporated into audited measurements in 2017.
2016 objectives
• Set carbon emissions and water targets.
• Obtain Clean Industry and ISO 14001 certification at Saucito.
• Implement an information system.
• Strengthen the mechanism for internal audits of 
environmental compliance.
2016 performance
• We engaged some NGOs and researched target setting 
approaches consistent with the United Nations Sustainable 
Development Goals (SDG). 
• Saucito has accomplished 90% of the requirements to  
get the ISO 14001 and Clean Industry certifications. 
• The Environment Information System is ready to be 
rolled-out.

Environmental Impact Assessments (EIAs)
Before developing any mining project, we conduct EIAs,  
which identify potential impacts and actions to manage them.  
EIAs may address the following for potential impact: surface  
and groundwater resources, water quality, air quality, soils, 
biodiversity (including threatened or endangered species) 
landscape and socio-economic conditions. The EIA report,  
known as environmental impact statement (EIS), is presented  
to the environmental authorities for their evaluation. 4

Water
Mining and processing ore require large volumes of water, and  
we operate in some arid regions where water is frequently a 
relevant issue for communities. Hence, securing access and being 
responsible water stewards are critical success factors. Our water 
management approach is based on operational excellence and 
cooperation with stakeholders, notably communities, authorities 
and NGOs. We recognise water as a human right and cooperate 
with communities to increase water access.
Risk assessment
Our EIAs allow us to understand water resources and their 
vulnerability on a local and regional scale before developing our 
projects. Responding to the expectations of our stakeholders,  
we conduct our evaluation of water risk using the Aqueduct  
tool from the World Resources Institute (WRI).

Water stress measures the ratio of total annual water withdrawal to average  
annual available blue water. This is a commonly used indicator also known  
as relative water demand.
Water quantity
We obtain water rights from authorities before using any water in 
mining and mineral processing. We respect our water quotas and 
cooperate with water authorities and other stakeholders, including 
communities, to increase water access. We rely primarily on 
groundwater (mine water and wells) and municipal wastewater  
to supply our operations. 
Our Fresnillo and Saucito operations build resilience using 
municipal wastewater. Ciénega, located in the mountains upstream, 
relies on mine water (the ore is below the groundwater table). 
Penmont, located in an arid and low water use region, is supplied 
by wells. The proximity of Penmont to the sea offers an opportunity 
to explore the use of seawater.
Water quality and conservation
Mining and mineral processing is less sensitive to the quality of 
incoming water, allowing for the reuse of wastewater or brackish 
water, and thereby reducing our water footprint. Additionally our 
mineral processing facilities use closed water circuits, eliminating the 
need to discharge processed water into water streams. In regards  
to the majority of our underground mines, de-watering is required 
(draining groundwater by pumping), to allow access to the ore. 
Unused water is sent to settlement ponds to control suspended 
solids before discharging the now cleaned water downstream. 
The quality of discharged water is important to downstream users 
and ecosystems and as a result we monitor and take action to 
ensure our discharges respect water quality regulations. We have 
not detected negative downstream impacts on ecosystems or 
waterbodies due to our groundwater intake or water discharges.
Public policy
We engage public policymakers and other stakeholders through 
the Mexican Chapter of the World Business Council for Sustainable 
Development (CESPEDES) and the Mexican Mining Chamber 
(CAMIMEX), whose positions and initiatives can be consulted on 
their websites. Mexico recently reactivated the process to enact  
a new Water Law. Our view is that water policy should foster 
efficiency and sustainably of the resource. Key considerations 
should be: governance, conservation, incentives for efficiency and 
reuse, long-term planning and certainty of permits, and flexibility 
for water transfers among users and basins. 
Communities 
Communities benefit from the availability of water from  
our dewatering operations. We believe that cooperation  
with communities helps limit conflicts arising from access  
issues. We also work with municipalities to invest in water and 
wastewater infrastructure, notably with their mining tax funds 
(see Community Relations pages 95-99). We are committed  
to building trust with the communities, and have launched  
an initiative for joint water monitoring. 87

Fresnillo plc Annual Report 2016
Climate change & energy
Mining is an energy intensive business. Energy is used at every 
stage of the value chain, representing a significant portion of our 
overall costs. Fossil fuels are used in extraction and hauling of ore 
and waste rock removal, while electricity is used in our processing 
plants. As ore grade decreases and mining goes deeper, we  
expect an increase in our energy demand. Given the relation 
between energy and greenhouse gas emissions, we also strive to 
decarbonise our process to mitigate the risks of climate change. 
Our strategy is based on energy efficiency and progressive 
integration of renewables in our energy portfolio.
Governance 
The Board’s HSECR Committee reviews our performance, risks and 
opportunities at their biannual meetings with management, who 
are responsible for integrating climate change into the business 
and operating strategy.
Operational and energy efficiency
Operational excellence and, more specifically, energy efficiency,  
are key to tackling the challenge of deeper mining and lower ore 
qualities. Our operating mines set energy efficiency targets each 
year; the open pit operations seek to optimise the truck fleet, use 
of diesel additives and waste dumps to reduce haulage distances, 
while in the underground operations, our initiatives are related  
to the optimisation of ventilation and measures to reduce ore 
dilution. In 2016, our mineral processing plants began to optimise 
consumption by reducing electricity usage at peak grid hours.  
We closely monitor technological developments in energy 
efficiency for the mines of tomorrow.
Carbon cost exposure and carbon regulation readiness
Mexico has carbon taxes embedded in the price of fossil fuels, 
based on a carbon price of US$3.7 per tonne of CO
2
, with natural 
gas taxed at zero as it is considered the cleanest of fossil fuels.  
The carbon tax is paid by fuel producers and importers as other 
excise taxes and is generally passed on to consumers. In 2017, 
Mexico begins a transition from administered prices to market 
prices; prices will float following market conditions, with volatility 
contained to a target zone with adaptable excise taxes/subsidies. 
Complete price liberalisation of fuels is expected in 2018. Recently, 
the government of the Mexican state of Zacatecas, where our 
Fresnillo and Saucito operations are located, introduced an 
additional carbon tax of US$12.5 (MX$250) per tonne of CO
2
, 
becoming effective in 2017.
Mexico launched a year-long simulation of a cap-and-trade system 
as part of a plan of Mexican authorities to introduce a national 
carbon market in 2018, which authorities intend to link with 
California and Québec. Mexico operates a mandatory emissions 
registry; our experience with voluntary reporting has proven 
valuable to compliance with this regulation.
We do not expect climate change regulations to reduce demand 
for gold, although there may be an increase in demand for lead, 
zinc and silver for applications in renewables. 
Public policy and preparedness for the physical impacts 
As with water stewardship, we engage public policymakers and 
other stakeholders through the Mexican Chapter of the World 
Business Council for Sustainable Development (CESPEDES), 
whose positions and initiatives can be consulted on their website. 
The most significant climate change impacts for our Company 
relate to water. See pages 86-87 for a more detailed discussion  
of our water usage and conservation efforts. 
Fresnillo plc supports effective, efficient and equitable policies  
and prices of carbon. We consider that a policy is effective when  
it meets its reduction targets, efficient when it is cost effective  
and equitable when all jurisdictions are contributing to solutions. 
We believe that carbon policies must be implemented in a manner 
that is reasonably consistent between jurisdictions so that the risk 
of creating a competitive disadvantage for some emitters does not 
induce carbon leakage. 
With regard to the introduction of a supplemental carbon tax in 
the state of Zacatecas, we have engaged with state authorities  
on the economic distortions that could be created by adding the 
state’s carbon prices on top of the national rate. 
Transparency and disclosure
We account for and monitor our greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions 
based on an inventory management plan (IMP), a best practice 
proposed by the Climate Leaders programme of the US 
Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). We are developing a 
third party evaluation of the effectiveness of our diesel additives 
in our open pit mines. We participate in the climate change 
programme of the Carbon Disclosure Project (CDP) and the 
Mexican GHG disclosure programme, GEI Mexico.

Waste management
Our operations produce mineral waste and, in much smaller 
proportion, non-mineral hazardous waste. The global trend of 
lower ore grades will increase mineral waste over time, especially 
in open pit mining. We recognise that responsible management of 
waste is essential to protect the health and safety of communities, 
the quality of the environment and our reputation. We are 
committed to safe management of wastes, paying great attention 
to the structural and chemical stability of our mineral waste 
storage facilities.
Mining waste
Mining operations remove waste rock to access the ore.  
This primarily incorporates either the overburden (rock or soil 
overlaying a mineral deposit) of open pit operations, or gangue 
(the rock or mineral occurring with the metallic ore but of no 
commercial value) excavated in underground works to access  
the ore. Most mining waste is transported and deposited in waste 
piles for permanent storage, though some waste rock is used in 
underground cut and fill operations. The majority of the Company’s 
mineral waste is generated by the open pit operations at Penmont 
and deposited in waste rock piles. Reclamation usually consists of 
re-contouring and restoring native plants and vegetation to ensure 
long-term stability.
Processing waste
In our processing facilities we reduce the ore to the size of sand 
and silt to form a slurry, which goes through a cyanide leaching 
process to extract the desired metals, or a flotation process to 
concentrate the ore for its transportation to a metallurgic complex. 
T ailings, the fine ore gains that remain in the slurry at the end of 
the process, are generally considered a processing waste since 
their metal content makes further processing uneconomical; 
however, they may also be used as input for tailing processing 
plants for further recovery of metals, as is the case in our Pyrites 
plant under development (see page 70). 
T ailings are pumped from the plants to sedimentation ponds, 
known as tailing dams, for safe storage. The decanted water, 
released by the sedimentation of tailings, is harvested and pumped 
back to the processing plants. We have no mining operations  
with riverine tailings disposal discharge tailings in nearby rivers.
Tailings Storage Facilities (TSFs)
T ailings management is a key concern for the mining industry. 
While very rare, recent tailings incidents in the industry have 
served as a reminder of how critical these structures are. We are 
fully committed to addressing the expectations of our stakeholders 
to build and operate TSFs responsibly. 
Our tailings dams are designed and built following the 
hydrological, geotechnical and structural design requirements  
of the Mexican authorities to resist extreme weather and seismic 
events. We pay particular attention to the chemical stability of the 
tailings, so the quality of any seepage does not represent a danger 
to human health or the environment. We keep strict control of the 
water balance to prevent overtopping failures, and ban the use of 
tailings dams as water reservoirs. We have diversion channels to 
prevent runoff water from entering the dam reservoir and seepage 
collection systems to protect the environment downstream. In 
addition to our daily inspections and internal audits, we conduct 
third party stability reviews of the embankments of our operating 
and closed tailings dams in addition to regulatory inspections. 
Facilities can be closed in a manner that is compatible with the 
surrounding environment. Our historical tailings facility at Fresnillo, 
for example, now operate as an ecological park for the community 
and have the environmental quality certification from the Mexican 
Environment Ministry.

Metallurgical waste
Metallurgical waste refers to piles of spent ore and the tailings 
produced by heap and dynamic leaching, respectively. 
Cyanide-bearing mineral waste is disposed of safely. We use 
impermeable membranes at the base of geo-technically engineered 
heaps and tailings to prevent seepage to groundwater and enhance 
structural stability. Geotechnical reviews are performed to ensure 
that the piles and embankments are safe. Channels surrounding the 
heaps and contingency ponds are hydraulically designed to handle 
flood flows caused by extreme rainfall events and monitoring  
up and downstream proactively detects changes in water quality. 
Once extraction of ore from the mine is complete, the piles are 
rinsed and allowed to drain down to ensure environmental 
protection. We consider progressive rehabilitation of mineral  
waste facilities is the best path for responsible mining. 
Public policy
Following recent international cases of tailing dam failures,  
Mexican authorities launched an extensive re-assessment of the 
regulations for design and operation of tailings dams. A multi-
stakeholder group was formed to review a proposal based on the 
guidelines of the Mining Association of Canada (MAC) and the 
Canadian Dam Association, both considered as the best available 
practice. Fresnillo plc participates in the process as an affiliated 
company of the Mexican Mining Chamber.

Non-mineral and hazardous waste
Non-mineral wastes are most commonly managed through 
recycling, off-site treatment and disposal. Hazardous wastes are 
subject to strict regulation by Mexican authorities at our own 
storage facilities and at hazardous waste receiving facilities.
Public policy
Separate from the aforementioned supplemental carbon tax,  
the state of Zacatecas introduced a US$5 (MX$100) tax for the 
storage of waste rock and tailings. We consider that ‘revenue 
oriented’ taxes on top of regulatory compliance reduces the  
ability of companies to invest in technology for mineral waste 
management. The Mexican Mining Chamber issued public 
statements urging the government of Zacatecas to reconsider 
such taxes that reduce the competitiveness of mining companies 
operating in the state.
Cyanide management: environmental aspects
Environmental protection measures are critical for cyanide 
leaching systems; we operate in compliance with international  
best practices as put forth by the International Cyanide 
Management Institute (ICMI) and the Mexican standard ‘NOM-155 
SEMARNAT-2007’ that establishes environmental requirements  
for gold and silver leaching systems.
Once gold and silver are extracted from the cyanide solution, 
process water is reused in the leaching process; water is also 
harvested from the cyanide-bearing tailings and recirculation 
generates savings in cyanide, reductions to the fresh water 
footprint and elimination of discharges into water streams.

Acid mine drainage
Acid mine drainage (AMD) is a major environmental challenge for 
the mining industry. Uncontrolled AMD represents a risk to surface 
and groundwater resources during mine operation as well as a 
legacy issue after closure. We analyse the mineral properties and 
conduct geochemical tests to screen AMD potential of ore mineral 
and waste rock. In our operations with AMD risk, notably at San 
Ramón, we implement site-specific management strategies such 
as capping waste rock piles with a dry cover (to reduce the entry 
of oxygen and water) and collecting and treating acid water. 
Mexico is currently reviewing the norms that regulate the chemical 
analysis of tailings and their AMD potential. The Mexican Mining 
Chamber participates in the consultation process of this regulation. 
What is acid mine drainage?
Metallic ore deposits may contain abundant sulphide minerals. 
Weathering of sulphides initiates an oxidation process that, 
uncontrolled, may lead to acid mine water (low pH) and mobilisation 
(dissolving) of metals and metalloids. However, not all the ore 
deposits with sulphides generate AMD. Ore deposits may also 
contain other minerals such as carbonates and silicates that act  
as natural buffers, neutralising (consuming) acid water. Hence,  
AMD potential greatly depends on the relative proportion of acid  
vs. neutralising minerals in the ore and gangue. 
Communities
We engage our neighbouring communities to raise environmental 
awareness through events such as World Water Day, World

Ethics and culture
We aspire to demonstrate a well-established ethical culture 
through our actions and behaviours. In 2016, we updated our Code 
of Conduct to reflect learnings and higher expectations for ethics 
leadership, and joined the Business Ethics Leadership Alliance 
(BELA) of the Ethisphere Institute to identify and adopt ethical 
best practices from other companies. We also approached the 
Center for Leadership Ethics of the Eller Business School at the 
University of Arizona to develop a customised approach to embed 
ethics in our culture.
We aim to encourage winning behaviours to embed ethics  
and integrity in our culture. We engage our people to share  
why business ethics and integrity are key priorities for us, and 
provide training on how to enable and support these behaviours, 
including the use of our behavioural compass. This tool serves  
as a guide to making decisions when faced with ethical dilemmas.  
We communicate our policies throughout the year and in our 
‘Aguas’ (Watch out) campaigns.
Our moral compass with four simple rules to guide ethical  
decision making: 
Am I following the rules? 
Can I make an informed decision? 
Have I thought about the consequences? 
Could I explain this to my family and would they be happy?

Approach
We seek to attract, develop and retain the best  
people, and engage them over the long term.  
We work to develop an organisational culture based  
on trust, and to embed ethics and integrity into  
our culture in order to create a fair and respectful

Human resources 
We seek to strengthen the talent pipeline to satisfy our present and 
future business needs, ensuring we have the people with the right 
skill sets and development potential to execute our business strategy . 
Human and labour rights in the workplace
We are strongly committed to internationally recognised human 
and labour rights, and take necessary measures to prevent and 
remedy any deviations thereof. The Honours Commission is 
responsible for investigating and sanctioning unethical behaviours, 
including infringements to human and labour rights. T o raise 
awareness of these issues, our ‘Aguas’ (Watch out) campaign 
engages people to speak out and denounce these behaviours  
in conjunction with our Fresnillo Plays Fair whistleblowing 
programme. This allows anyone to anonymously report incidents 
of discrimination or harassment, whether they involve a co-worker, 
a supervisor or manager. Whoever is found, after an appropriate 
investigation, to have engaged in discrimination or harassment,  
is subject to appropriate disciplinary action, which, depending  
on the gravity, may include dismissal.
Working conditions 
Our approach to compensation is externally competitive and 
internally equitable. We provide competitive wages and benefits 
matching or exceeding median wages in the countries where  
we operate. In Mexico, we regularly conduct market reviews to 
ensure that compensation remains competitive. In 2016, unionised 
employees received a 5.5% raise while non-unionised staff received 
on average a 4.5% raise.
We offer non-unionised employees life insurance, health care, 
disability coverage, maternity and paternity leave, retirement 
provision, savings fund and profit sharing (known as PTU in 
Mexico). Our collective agreements with unionised-employees 
consider compensation and working conditions, such as wages, 
recruitment and dismissals, shifts and working hours, national 
holidays, vacations, work permits, disciplinary measures, personal 
equipment, training, health and safety, occupational diseases,  
life insurance, career opportunities (rank, seniority, etc.), savings 
fund and early retirement compensation. 
Whenever there are redundancies in a mine or a specific 
department, these employees are given preference over  
new external candidates to fill open positions in other mines  
or departments.
Discrimination 
We are committed to ensuring that our people are treated fairly 
and with dignity in the workplace. Hence, we do not tolerate any 
form of harassment, intimidation or discrimination. We promote 
equal opportunity in the workplace. Employment and career 
development decisions must be based on performance, 
qualifications, skills, experience and ethical behaviour. 
Discriminatory practices are unacceptable. 
Recognising that women are underrepresented in our workforce 
(see Diversity on page 94), we implement rules for compensation  
of non-unionised employees based on salary ranges that are gender 
independent. Currently, differences in the compensation of women 
with respect to men are due mainly to seniority in their positions. 
Child labour 
Child labour deprives youth of their childhood, dignity and 
education. Our minimum age for employment is 18, and we 
mandate such hiring practices for our contractors at all sites  
where we operate. We contribute to the eradication of child  
labour in our communities by supporting school infrastructure  
and reading and education programmes that improve educational 
opportunities for children.
Forced labour – UK Modern Slavery Act
Modern Slavery makes reference to two types of offense: 
i) slavery, servitude and forced or compulsory labour; 
and ii) human trafficking.
We require mining contractors and suppliers to comply with  
our Code of Conduct, with contracts that stipulate compliance 
with our health and safety policies and operating procedures.  
All contractors must register their employees with the Mexican 
health and pension system (IMSS), which in turn requires 
disclosure of compensation and working hours. This year we 
conducted focus groups with employees and contractors to 
evaluate their work experience and our corporate responsibility;  
no evidence of modern slavery was detected. Our employees and 
contractors must treat members of the community with dignity 
and respect. Their behaviour must not impact the wellbeing of 
vulnerable members of the community by engaging in activities 
such as compulsory labour or sexual exploitation. All employees 
and contractors are encouraged to report any such incident  
to our whistleblowing line as mentioned above.
We intend to increase our programme with risk assessments, 
due diligence and training tailored to the Modern Slavery Act. 
Unions: freedom of association 
We respect the rights of employees to freedom of association and 
collective bargaining as laid out in Mexican law. We are committed 
to building positive and productive relations with local labour 
unions through continuous dialogue and collaboration. T o date, 
Fresnillo plc has not experienced a work stoppage or industrial 
action as a consequence of labour disputes.
Each business unit has a union committee with elected 
representatives. We engage newly elected representatives of our 
four committees with workshops to build responsible leadership 
skills and to raise awareness of their rights and responsibilities. 
Our HR superintendents are responsible for maintaining 
permanent dialogue with these committees. Our management 
teams in each operation organise results presentations several 
times a year to foster common understanding of the business. 
We have embedded Health & Safety as a key cooperation topic 
with unions at the local and national level as part of our strategy 
to develop a safety culture.
In 2016, we successfully negotiated the remuneration adjustment 
with the four committees. Collective bargaining covers the 
elements outlined in ‘Working conditions’ above. In 2016, the 
incumbent union of our Penmont operation was challenged  
by an opposing mining union, forcing an election specified  
by Mexican law. The incumbent union SNMM Frente won the  
election with 94% of the votes.

Diversity: women in mining
We recognise that diversity in the workforce brings a range  
of perspectives and skills that make companies stronger. 
Our gender diversity indicators cover the full workforce; however, 
the Company can address the diversity gap amongst its non-
unionised employees more readily. Some highlights:
• Women represent 13.5% of our non-unionised employees  
with an average seniority of 6.5 years. 
• 44% of women are employed in operational (engineering)  
roles; the remaining are in support or administrative functions 
(finance, accounting, community relations, etc.). 
• 13% of non-unionised woman earned a promotion in 2016. 
Women are underrepresented within our Company and in the 
mining industry in general. Attracting women to mining roles in 
Mexico depends on a deep change in the perceptions on the role 
of gender in these positions. This will take time to rectify but it  
has been changing, particularly in relation to unionised workers in 
underground operations. Although many companies have decided 
to set numerical targets for diversity, we consider that skills and 
merit must remain the key criteria for employment and career 
development decisions. Hence, our efforts focus on engaging 
unions on the role of diversity and hiring and developing women 
with educational training in mining engineering, geology, finance 
and accounting.

2017 objectives
• Standardise stakeholder engagement plans. 
• Enhance our approach to social baseline and  
perception studies.
• Sponsor a reading and an entrepreneurial programme.
• Introduce the second phase of the Silver Saves  
Lives project.
Social Management System
We formalised our management system in 2016 to provide 
guidance on tools and best practices to implement our strategy. 
Our Management System consists of procedures distributed 
across the phases of mining following our approach ‘Know the 
community’, ‘Engage effectively’ and ‘Build with the community’. 
These processes are tracked in our Borealis Information System.
Community Relations 
Strategic priority
T o engage with and support the development  
of our communities.
Approach
Our communities are strategic partners. Having their 
trust requires effectively engaging them and being 
accountable for our impacts. We recognise that  
building trust is the only way to obtain and preserve  
our social licence to operate. Our corporate strategy 
covers all phases of the mining cycle, and our social 
investments target development levers such as 
education, capacity building and infrastructure.  
We also contribute to social welfare (public health, 
social interaction and sports) and help raise 
environmental awareness within our communities.

Advancing our knowledge
We build our knowledge of communities by identifying 
stakeholders and understanding their positions on key issues. 
With the support of the Borealis Information System we  
track our stakeholder registry, informal and formal meetings, 
incident and commitment registries and grievances. Continuous 
engagement and comprehensive social analyses help us gain 
further understanding of the risks and opportunities in the 
communities where we operate.
Baseline and social impact assessments in projects
We conduct social baseline studies to better understand the 
socio-economic conditions of new projects and social impact 
assessment to better understand how our projects might positively 
or negatively impact local communities. We recently conducted 
studies for our exploration projects at Orysivo, el Gigante and 
Las T orres. 
Perception studies in our operations
We periodically commission comprehensive perception studies  
to measure the effectiveness of our strategy and to deepen  
our insight on the issues that matter to our communities. These  
aim to evaluate how we are perceived as employers, neighbours 
and to what extent our credibility, environmental and social 
commitment are recognised. The results are analysed by senior 
managers and community relations teams and help us evaluate 
the success of our engagement and social investment 
approaches, identify risks and opportunities, and determine 
how we should advance our engagement and social investment 
in order to improve performance. 
Social and Sustainability Report continued
Community Relations continued
Engaging effectively
Effective engagement improves our understanding of community 
expectations and builds mutually beneficial relationships 
throughout the life of our mines. We aim to engage early in the 
process to manage community expectations and develop trust 
through the mining lifecycle. Building a reservoir of stakeholder 
capital is key to resilience when challenges arise. The focus of 
our engagement efforts changes over the lifecycle of operations, 
as follows: 
Exploration Our exploration teams are the first to establish 
contact with the community. Our stakeholders 
are identified and the engagement efforts 
focus on obtaining temporary land access  
to explore and assessing social risks. 
Project 
(feasibility 
– development)
The identification and relation with our 
stakeholders deepens in this phase of the 
cycle. Local hiring, contracts and social 
investment are part of our efforts to build trust. 
We conduct social risk assessments in our 
advanced feasibility and development projects. 
These studies facilitate the identification of the 
issues that matter to the community.
Operation We engage the communities regularly with 
formal and informal meetings to manage  
their expectations and detect risks and 
opportunities. Comprehensive perception 
studies help to monitor the perception of the 
benefits and the assessment of the issues that 
matter to the community.
T o help create a consistent approach across our operations, 
development projects and exploration sites, we are working to 
develop a standard for stakeholder engagement plans. These plans 
will be based on stakeholder identification, mapping and analysis, 
and will define the engagement approach (formal, informal 
meetings, consultations, etc.) and frequency.

FRESNILLO TODAY STRATEGIC REPORT CORPORATE GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Land acquisition and resettlement
Developing a mining project involves land acquisition and in 
some cases, the resettlement of households. We recognise that 
these are complex and life-changing issues for the communities. 
Poorly planned and managed, land acquisition and resettlement 
can adversely impact the livelihoods and social structure of 
communities, damage our relationships, or even cause conflict. 
We recognise that the right to an adequate standard of living after 
land acquisition and resettlement projects is a basic human right. 
We seek to manage resettlement responsibly, respecting local laws 
and adopting international best practices.
No resettlement occurred at our operations during 2016. 
Nonetheless, we are developing guidance for resettlements, 
including social baseline and asset surveys, entitlement and 
compensation framework, negotiation, livelihood restoration 
programmes and ongoing monitoring and evaluation. In 2017, 
we will further develop our guidance, ensuring that it meets  
the criteria set by the International Finance Corporation (IFC) 
Performance Standard 5 on Land Acquisition and Involuntary 
Resettlement, and that it considers lessons learned by other 
companies, notably those operating in Mexico.
We aim to avoid resettlements by exploring alternative designs, 
but when unavoidable, we will work together with affected 
households, communities and governments to minimise adverse 
impacts, restoring or improving livelihoods and living conditions. 
Developing with the community
We engage local authorities to fund infrastructure projects with 
the Mining Fund in the communities where we operate. We partner 
with the UNAM Foundation and local health authorities to organise 
health weeks that benefit communities with free health care.  
We continue to build on our partnership with INNOVEC and the 
government of the state of Zacatecas to support the teaching of 
science in elementary schools. Several schools in the neighbouring 
communities of Fresnillo and Saucito receive government funding 
to implement this innovative programme, which trains and equips 
schools to teach science in an experiential manner that piques the 
curiosity of children.
Strategic social investment
Health
In support of SDG 3, we seek to ensure healthy lives and  
promote wellbeing. We operate in some communities where 
access to healthcare is a stakeholder concern either due to remote 
geographic location or low socioeconomic levels, making access  
to health services difficult. Cooperation with NGOs and local health 
authorities is crucial to foster a preventive and self-care culture. 
Please refer to page 80-81 for further information.
Health Weeks
In 2016, we organised health weeks at Ciénega, the Fresnillo district 
and Penmont. 
Water
Access to safe drinking water is a major global challenge. We  
are committed to SDG 6, to ensure availability and sustainable 
management of water and sanitation for all. We collaborate with 
communities through water and sanitation infrastructure funded 
by the Mining fund, direct social investment and raising awareness 
of environmental care.
Silver Saves Lives (SSL)
The objective of the SSL initiative is to support vulnerable 
communities to increase safe water access in public spaces, 
especially in public schools. SSL is designed to propose a range of 
solutions depending on water sources and a community’s needs; 
we anticipate working with a variety of knowledgable partners, 
amongst them the communities themselves.
We implemented water harvesting systems in four schools in the 
Ciénega community. This pilot project was assessed by a third 
party to provide objective feedback that can be integrated into  
the next phase of the project for which planning is underway;  
we aim to launch this initiative in Penmont, San Julián and Saucito.
T o raise awareness and foster acceptability in this first phase, 
we organised educational, information and training sessions; art 
workshops, mural paintings, and storytelling aided by photography 
aimed at bridging the divide between mine and community.  
Our aim is to create a conversation (both visual and oral) on local 
water needs, the surrounding environment and the possibility  
of collectively becoming water stewards in the region. 
Education
In line with SDG 4, we seek to ensure inclusive and quality 
education for all and to promote lifelong learning. We collaborate 
with communities in programmes to engage children to read, 
communicate and learn science. We see education as a key lever 
to reduce poverty and inequality.
Along with the INNOVEC partnership for improving the  
teaching of science in the neighbouring communities of Fresnillo 
and Saucito, we also engaged technical high schools in our 
communities of Penmont and Fresnillo to get familiar with  
the FIRST (For Inspiration and Recognition of Science and 
T echnology) Robotics Competition (FRC). We will partner with 
these schools to enrol teams in the next robotics competition. 
Engineers of Fresnillo will coach students in the FRC to build  
a robot that can perform certain tasks. 
Children who develop solid reading skills perform better at  
school and improve their potential for full participation in society. 
Recognising the importance of reading, we have partnered with 
the NGO International Board on Books for Y oung People (IBBY) 
to bring books and children together in the communities where 
we operate. With the valuable support of IBBY Mexico, we opened 
some ‘Bunkos’ in our communities of Ciénega and close to 
Penmont, and one for the children of our employees at Fresnillo. 
Bunkos are small community libraries where volunteers read aloud 
to children and facilitate discussions. Unlike traditional libraries, 
Bunkos offer a space where children can choose their own 
readings and discuss their ideas with other children. In 2017,  
we will expand the project with a target of Bunkos in 58 schools  
in the communities of Ciénega, Penmont, Saucito, Fresnillo,  
San Julián, Orisyvo and Gigante (Guanajuato) projects. IBBY will 
guide us on the choice of books, the initial training of teachers, 
monitoring of progress and coaching of the teachers. 4

Fresnillo plc Annual Report 2016
Capacity building
We support SDG 8, to promote sustained, inclusive and sustainable 
economic growth, full and productive employment and decent 
work for all.
Local suppliers 
Promoting small and medium businesses is key to social 
acceptability and community development. We are committed  
to developing and hiring local suppliers. We have more than 230 
local suppliers providing services to our mines and exploration 
projects. We collaborate with the NGO Proempleo to train, coach 
and develop the skills of small businesses.
Engaging municipalities to diversify their economies
In 2017, we will collaborate with municipal governments to develop 
entrepreneurs in Fresnillo, Ciénega and Penmont. With the 
assistance of NGOs and consultants, we will engage municipalities 
to identify business opportunities to diversify local economies from 
mining. Preparing communities in advance is key to preparing for 
mine closure. 
Infrastructure 
We invest strategically in social infrastructure and collaborate  
with communities to engage municipalities to fund infrastructure 
projects in their communities with the Mining Fund. 
Engaging authorities to benefit our communities  
with the Mining Fund
We partner with communities to engage local authorities and 
regional Mining Fund committees to consider funding projects 
in the communities where we operate. The outcomes of the 
perception surveys and regular engagement were used to identify 
the most relevant infrastructure issues for the communities.  
We supported the communities with the preliminary design and 
budgeting of project proposals for water and wastewater projects, 
pavement, lightning, education infrastructure, sanitation and 
landfills, among others.
We believe that a key success factor to raising social acceptability 
rests on the willingness of municipalities to allocate a reasonable 
part of their funds to those communities near mining operations.

Rural entrepreneurs in San Julián
Our San Julián project supports farmers and other rural 
producers to improve their production and marketing 
systems by joining one of the Strategic Projects for Food 
Security (known in Spanish as PESA). PESA projects are 
implemented by Rural Development Agencies (ADRs) 
using strategies of the Food and Agriculture Organisation 
(FAO). A group of farmers from eight of our communities 
are currently local suppliers of vegetables, eggs and  
pork meat. Through technical support, their production 
improved to comply with the quality standards of our 
dining facilities. In addition, in the community of ‘La 
Lagunita’, a group of women entrepreneurs launched a 
bakery with the support of the community, the Mexican 
National Council for Culture and Arts (CONACULTA) and 
the San Julián Project. With their bakery they are now 
self-employed and have created jobs for 15 more people, 
preserving the tradition of making bread in wood-fired 
ovens. Their bread is sold to the Company, in the 
community and nearby communities. A similar group  
of entrepreneurial woman from the community of ‘Las 
Papas’ launched a tortillería (a tortilla bakery) to supply  
our dining facilities.  99

The Company achieved strong financial results with growth of 103.7% in gross profit, 88.5% in EBITDA, and 552.6% in attributable profit  
for the year, excluding the effect of the Silverstream revaluation. Furthermore, cash generation from our operations more than offset  
the investment in capex and the payment of dividends, resulting in the Company generating net cash of US$412.5 million for the period, 
with a cash and short-term investment balance of US$912.0 million as of 31 December 2016. This strong financial position both reflects  
and extends our ability to continue generating value for our stakeholders.

The Group’s financial performance is largely determined by the operational performance of our assets and the ability of our management 
and personnel to achieve our strategic goals. This year in particular, metal prices and the devaluation of the Mexican peso, which lie 
beyond our control, have had a favourable effect on our financial results. These include:
Precious metal prices
In 2016, the average realised gold price increased 10.7%, to US$1,246.5 per ounce and the average realised silver price increased 10.3% to 
$17.2 per ounce. Furthermore, the average realised lead and zinc prices increased 7.0% and 20.0% year on year, to US$85.1 and US$100.5 
cents per pound, respectively. 
As in previous years, the Company has structured certain hedge positions for lead and zinc to mitigate the risk of metal price volatilities, 
as set out in the financial statements pages 208-209.
MX$/US$ exchange rate
The average spot Mexican peso/US dollar exchange rate devalued by 17.7%, from $15.85 per US dollar in 2015 to $18.66 per US dollar in 
2016. This resulted in a favourable effect estimated at US$45.2 million on the Group’s production costs, as costs denominated in Mexican 
pesos (approximately two-thirds of total costs) were lower when converted to US dollars. 
The Mexican peso/US dollar spot exchange rate at 31 December 2016 was $20.66 per US dollar, compared to $17.21 per US dollar at the 
beginning of the year. The 20.1% devaluation had an adverse effect on: i) monetary assets transacted in Mexican pesos; and ii) taxes and 
mining rights as the devaluation resulted in an increase in related deferred tax liabilities.
Cost deflation
In 2016, there was a net decrease in the weighted average input cost over the year, of 8.1%. This deflation reflected, amongst other factors, 
the favourable effect of the 17.7% average devaluation of the Mexican peso against the US dollar.  101
Fresnillo plc Annual Report 2016
FRESNILLO TODAY STRATEGIC REPORT CORPORATE GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Labour
Employees received on average a 5.0% increase in wages in Mexican pesos, and administrative employees at the mines received a 4.5% 
increase; when converted to US dollars, the weighted average labour deflation was 11.1%. 
Energy
Electricity
The weighted average cost of electricity decreased by 16.6% from US$7.1 cents per kW in 2015 to US$5.9 cents per kW in 2016. Electricity 
rates are set by the Comisión Federal de Electricidad (CFE), the national utility, based on their average generating cost, which correlates 
mainly to fuel oil and coal prices. In 2016, the decrease in electricity rates by CFE was mainly explained by the positive effect of the 
devaluation of the Mexican peso/US dollar exchange rate, and to a lesser extent, the lower average generating cost following a decrease 
in fuel prices.
Diesel
The weighted average cost of diesel in US dollars decreased 15.6% to US$62.6 cents per litre in 2016, compared to US$74.2 cents per litre 
in 2015. Diesel prices in 2016 were controlled by Petróleos Mexicanos (PEMEX), the national oil company. Complete price liberalisation of 
fuels is expected in 2018.

Weighted average of all operating materials (6.5)
For the third consecutive year, unit prices of the majority of key operating materials decreased, resulting in a net weighted average 
decrease of 6.5%. This reflects the combined effect of price deflation and the weighting of each component in the total cost of operating 
materials. There has been no significant impact on the unit cost of operating materials from the devaluation of the Mexican peso/US dollar 
exchange rate as the majority of these items are dollar-denominated.
Contractors 
Agreements are signed individually with each contractor company, and include specific terms and conditions that cover not only labour, 
but also operating materials, equipment and maintenance, amongst others. Contractor costs are mainly denominated in Mexican pesos 
and are an important component of the Company’s total production costs. In 2016, increases granted to contractors, whose agreements 
were due for review during the period, ranged from 2.2% to 20.0% in Mexican pesos (equivalent to -13.2% to 2.0% in dollar terms), resulting 
in a weighted average decrease of 4.0% in US dollars.
Maintenance
Unit prices of spare parts for maintenance decreased 6.0% on average in US dollar terms.
Others 
Other cost components include freight and insurance premiums, which decreased by an estimated 11.6% and 7.7% respectively on a per 
unit basis. The remaining components had an average deflation of 7.0% over 2015. 
Treatment and refining charges
Treatment and refining charges

 are reviewed annually using international benchmarks. Treatment charges per tonne of lead and  
zinc concentrate decreased in dollar terms by 11.5% and 8.7%, respectively, whilst silver refining charges decreased 4.3% year-on-year.  
However, this was mostly offset by the increase in volumes of zinc concentrates with high silver contents shipped from Fresnillo and 
Saucito to Met-Mex. As a result, treatment and refining charges set out in the income statement decreased by only 1.2% over 2015.
The effects of the above external factors, combined with the Group’s internal variables, are further described below through the main line 
items of the income statement.

T otal revenues for the full year of US$1,905.5 million increased by 31.9% over 2015. This was mainly explained by the 29.2% increase  
in adjusted revenue as a result of the increase in sales volumes and higher metal prices. 
In 2015, we entered into derivative contracts (which extended into 2016) to hedge part of our lead and zinc by-product production 
through collar structures, resulting in a US$1.5 million gain recorded in this year’s income statement. The chart below illustrates the total 
expired hedging structures for 2016; as of 31 December there were no outstanding positions.

In addition, during the second half of 2014, we initiated a one-off hedging programme to protect the value of the investment made on  
the Penmont acquisition. The hedging programme was executed for a total volume of 1,559,689 oz of gold with monthly maturities until 
December 2019, the effects of which are recorded as finance income and a small portion in revenue.

Fresnillo plc’s hedging policy for metal prices remained unchanged for the remainder of the portfolio, providing shareholders with full 
exposure to the gold and silver prices.
The higher volumes sold, mainly due to the reduction of gold inventories in the leaching pads at Herradura, and to a lesser extent, the 
start-up of San Julián, resulted in a positive impact on revenues of US$292.4 million, which represented 63.3% of the US$461.7 million 
increase in adjusted revenues. The remaining 36.7%, or US$169.3 million, was explained by the benefit of higher metal prices. 
The contribution of gold to adjusted revenues increased from 52% in 2015 to 55% in 2016, while the contribution of silver decreased from 
39% to 35%. This resulted from the combination of: i) the increase in volume of gold sold (+36.9%) which was higher than that of silver 
(+17.3%); and ii) the 10.7% increase in the average price of gold, whilst the average silver price rose 10.3%.

1. Adjusted revenues is revenue as disclosed in the income statement adjusted to exclude treatment and refining charges and gold, lead and zinc hedging.
• Herradura was the main contributor to adjusted revenues, reflecting the decrease in gold inventories in the leaching pads which was 
made possible due to the commissioning of the second Merrill Crowe Plant at the dynamic leaching plant (DLP) in the last quarter  
of 2015, eliminating the bottleneck in processing solution coming from the leaching pads and the DLP. 
• Saucito was the second contributor, although its contribution declined from 30% in 2015 to 26% in 2016, notwithstanding a 12.7% 
increase in adjusted revenues.
• Similarly, Fresnillo contributed a lesser share of adjusted revenues, but remained as the third most important contributor to the Group’s 
adjusted revenues. 
• Ciénega slightly decreased its contribution; whilst phase I of San Julián contributed for the first time.

Fresnillo plc Annual Report 2016
FRESNILLO TODAY STRATEGIC REPORT CORPORATE GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Cost of sales remained fairly stable at US$1,023.4 million. The US$12.1 million increase is explained by the following combination of factors:
• A decrease in adjusted production costs (-US$15.6 million): This was mainly driven by: i) the favourable effect of the 17.7% devaluation 
of the Mexican peso/US dollar exchange rate when converting peso-denominated costs to US dollars (-US$45.2 million); ii) the 
efficiencies achieved at Fresnillo, Saucito and Ciénega resulting from some optimisation projects and cost reduction initiatives  
(-US$8.6 million); iii) lower energy costs, excluding foreign exchange effects, reflecting lower unit prices of electricity and diesel 
(-US$6.4 million); iv) lower cost of operating materials (-US$6.0 million); and v) lower maintenance costs (-US$4.0 million). These 
positive effects were partially offset by: i) additional production costs related to the start-up of San Julián phase I (US$20.4 million);  
ii) additional production costs related to increased ore throughput at Herradura and Saucito (US$24.6 million); iii) higher contractor 
costs as a result of a greater number of contractors used to carry out development, mainly at Saucito, and an increase in the unit fees 
charged by contractors in Mexican pesos (US$4.8 million); iv) an increase in the unit cost of personnel (excluding foreign exchange 
effects) and other items in pesos (US$4.8 million). 
• Mexican peso/US dollar hedging (-US$25.8 million): During 2015 the Group entered into a combination of put and call options 
structured at zero cost (collars) which extended into 2016. The volume that expired during 2016 had been put in place to hedge 
US$198 million of costs denominated in Mexican pesos with average floor and cap exchange rates of $14.91 and $18.26 per US dollar 
respectively, resulting in a US$2.77 million loss recorded in the income statement; as of 31 December 2016, there were no outstanding 
positions.
• Reversal of inventories write-down, profit sharing and others (-US$15.8 million): The change is principally explained by the reversal  
of the provision recorded in December 2015 related to the forward price of gold falling below the inventory carrying cost at Soledad-
Dipolos. This trend was reversed in 2016. 
These positive effects were more than offset by increases in:
• Variation in change in work in progress (+US$53.9 million). This was mainly explained by the decrease in inventories at the leaching 
pads at Herradura.
• Depreciation (+US$15.3 million): The increase was explained by the larger asset base following the completion of San Julián phase I, 
and the increased depletion factor at Herradura. 
Cost per tonne, cash cost per ounce and all-in sustaining cost
Cost per tonne, calculated as total production costs less depreciation, profit sharing and exchange rate hedging effects, divided by total 
tonnage milled or deposited, is a key indicator to measure the effects of mining inflation and cost control performance at each mine and 
the Group as a whole. We have included cost per tonne hauled/moved as we believe it is a useful indicator to thoroughly analyse cost 
performance for the open pit mines. 
Cost per tonne
2016 2015 Change %
Fresnillo US$/tonne milled 43.93 48.20 (8.9)
Saucito US$/tonne milled 36.75 42.49 (13.5)
Ciénega US$/tonne milled 55.49 62.99 (11.9)
Herradura US$/tonne deposited 7.72 8.68 (11.0)

Noche Buena US$/tonne hauled 1.60 1.67 (4.2)
Explanations regarding changes in cost per tonne by mine were covered in the Review of Operations section, pages 58-67.
Cash cost per ounce, calculated as total cash cost (cost of sales plus treatment and refining charges less depreciation) less revenues  
from by-products divided by the silver or gold ounces sold, when compared to the corresponding metal price, is an indicator of the  
ability of the mine to cover its production costs. 106

Herradura US$ per gold ounce 470.72 472.53 (0.4)
Noche Buena US$ per gold ounce 765.90 972.74 (21.3)
The particular variations in cash cost for each mine are explained as follows:
Fresnillo: US$2.09/oz (2016) vs. US$5.60/oz (2015), (-62.6%)
The decrease in cash cost per ounce is mainly explained by the higher by-product credits per silver ounce due to the increase in gold,  
lead and zinc volumes sold at higher prices (-US$2.88/oz); lower cost per tonne (-US$0.66/oz) (see pages 58-59); increase in ore grade 
(-US$0.07 /oz); and others (-US$0.01/oz). This was partly offset by higher treatment and refining charges per silver ounce due to: higher 
zinc and lead ore grades which increased the volume of concentrates, and an increase in the participation of zinc concentrate which has  
a higher per unit treatment charge (+US$0.12/oz). 
Saucito: -US$0.39/oz (2016) vs. US$1.15/oz (2015), (-133.9%)
The decrease was driven by the higher by-product credits per ounce of silver resulting from increased gold, lead and zinc volumes  
sold at higher prices (-US$1.21/oz); lower cost per tonne (-US$0.63/oz) (see pages 60-61); and lower treatment and refining charges 
(-US$0.23/oz). These positive effects were partly offset by the expected lower silver grade (+US$0.52/oz); and others (+US$0.01/oz).
Ciénega: -US$217.19/oz (2016) vs. US$245.49/oz (2015), (-188.5%)
The decrease in cash cost was primarily explained by higher by-product credits per ounce of gold due to the increased volumes  
of silver, lead and zinc sold at higher prices (-US$457.22/oz); and the decrease in cost per tonne (-US$141.54/oz) (see pages 62-63).  
These favourable factors were partly offset by the expected decrease in gold grade (+US$98.31/oz); higher treatment and refining 
charges resulting from lower gold ore grade which requires producing more concentrate per ounce of gold, and higher lead and zinc  
ore grades which increase the volume of concentrates (+US$33.89/oz); and others (+US$3.88/oz). 
Herradura: US$470.72/oz (2016) vs. US$472.53/oz (2015), (-0.4%)
The decrease in cash cost resulted from the lower cost per tonne (-US$47.68/oz) (see page 64); higher by-product credits per gold  
ounce due to the increased volume of silver sold at a higher price (-US$1.09/oz); and lower treatment and refining charges (-US$0.05/oz). 
These favourable effects were offset by: i) the expected lower gold grade (+US$30.29/oz); ii) an adverse inventory valuation effect,  
as ounces with a lower cost of production in the current period are mixed with the initial higher cost of inventory affecting cost of sales 
(+US$16.47 /oz); and others (+US$0.24/oz). 
Noche Buena: US$765.90/oz (2016) vs. US$972.74/oz (2015), (-21.3%)
The decrease in cash cost per ounce was mainly explained by: i) the higher gold grade (-US$123.96/oz); ii) the lower cost per tonne 
(-US$46.03/oz) (see page 66); and iii) the others (-US$36.85/oz).
San Julián (phase I): commenced operations in August 2016, thus there are no comparable year-on-year figures. 
In addition to the traditional cash cost described above, the Group is reporting all-in sustaining costs (AISC), in accordance with the 
guidelines issued by the World Gold Council.
This cost metric is calculated as traditional cash cost plus on-site general, corporate and administrative costs, community costs related to 
current operations, capitalised stripping and underground mine development, sustaining capital expenditures and remediation expenses.
Management considers all-in sustaining costs a reasonable indicator of the mine’s ability to generate free cash flow when compared with 
the corresponding metal price, and a means to monitor not only current production costs, but also sustaining costs as it includes mine 
development costs incurred to prepare the mine for future production, as well as sustaining capex.

T otal gross profit, net of hedging gains and losses, totalled US$882.1 million in 2016. 
The US$449.0 million increase in gross profit was mainly explained by: i) the favourable effect of higher metal prices (+US$167.5 million); 
ii) the positive impact of increased gold production at Herradura (+US$128.9 million); iii) the start-up of San Julián phase I (+US$45.8 
million); iv) the 17.7% devaluation of the Mexican peso/US dollar (+US$45.2 million); v) higher ore grade at the Fresnillo mine (+US$29.0 
million); vi) higher production at Noche Buena (+US$23.4 million); vii) the reversal of the write down of inventories at Soledad-Dipolos 
(+US$10.7 million); viii) the positive effect of lower hedging losses and other effects (+US$24.1 million); and ix) efficiencies achieved  
at some of our mines through optimisation projects and cost reduction initiatives (+US$8.6 million). 
The above factors were partially offset by the lower ore grades at Herradura (-US$18.9 million) and the higher depreciation  
(-US$15.3 million).
Herradura became the largest contributor to the Group’s consolidated gross profit. Gross profit at Saucito increased by 35.6% to 
US$269.4 million, although its share of the Group’s consolidated gross profit declined to 31.1% in 2016. Gross profit at the Fresnillo mine 
rose to US$158.6 million in 2016, while the mine’s contribution to the Group’s total gross profit slightly increased to 18.3%. Noche Buena 
generated a gross profit of US$54.1 million, and contributed 6.2% to the Group’s consolidated gross profit. Ciénega’s share of the Group’s 
total gross profit increased to 5.6%, whilst San Julián contributed for the first time with 3.0%. 108
Fresnillo plc Annual Report 2016
Administrative expenses
Administrative expenses decreased 5.8% from US$62.8 million to US$59.1 million due mainly to a decrease in non-recurring engineering 
and construction services provided by Servicios Industriales Peñoles, S.A.B. de C. V ., lower cost of services provided by third parties,  
and the positive effect of the devaluation of the Mexican peso against the US dollar in administrative expenses denominated in pesos.

Exploration expenses decreased by 13.6% to US$121.2 million in 2016, reflecting management’s decision to reduce the expenditure in 
volatile market conditions. Nonetheless, the resource base was expanded as detailed on pages 71-75. An additional US$16.7 million was 
capitalised in association with mining works at Juanicipio and minor equipment acquired at the Centauro Deep, Orisyvo and Guanajuato 
projects. As a result, total investment in exploration was US$137.9 million in 2016, a decrease of 8.9% over 2015. In 2017, total invested  
in exploration is expected to be approximately US$160 million, of which US$8 million is estimated to be capitalised.

EBITDA margin 54.2 37.9
A gauge of the Group’s financial performance and key indicator to measure debt capacity is EBITDA, which is calculated as gross profit 
plus depreciation, less administrative, selling and exploration expenses. In 2016, EBITDA increased 88.5% mainly due to the higher gross 
profit, the higher depreciation which is added back and the lower exploration and administrative expenses. EBITDA margin expressed  
as a percentage of revenues increased accordingly, from 37.9% in 2015 to 54.2% in 2016. 
Other income and expenses
Other expenses decreased by 43.4% to US$9.0 million in 2016. This included disposals of fixed assets, remediation works and costs 
incurred in the maintenance of closed mines. This positively compares to the US$15.9 million recorded in the 2015 income statement.

FRESNILLO TODAY STRATEGIC REPORT CORPORATE GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Silverstream effects
The Silverstream contract is accounted for as a derivative financial instrument carried at fair value. The revaluation of the Silverstream 
contract generated a US$85.8 million non-cash gain mainly as a result of the increase in resources at the Sabinas mine and the higher 
forward price of silver, which were partly mitigated by the higher discount rate used. In addition, a US$47.7 million non-cash gain was 
generated by: i) the unwinding of the discounted values; and ii) the difference between payments (volume and price) actually received 
and accrued in 2016 and payments estimated in the valuation model as at 31 December 2015. The total effect recorded in the 2016 income 
statement was US$133.5 million, which favourably compares to the US$27.7 million registered in 2015. 
Since the IPO, cumulative cash received has been US$559.6 million, while total non-cash revaluation gains of US$683.8 million have been 
taken to the income statement. The Group expects further unrealised gains or losses will be taken to the income statement in accordance 
with silver price cyclicality or changes in the variables considered in valuing this contract. Further information related to the Silverstream 
contract is provided in the Balance Sheet section below and in notes 14 and 30 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
Finance costs and income 
Finance costs in 2016 decreased mainly due to the decline in accrued interest payable on the US$800 million principal amount of 5.500% 
Senior Notes, from US$36.0 million to US$29.0 million. 
In 2014 we entered into gold derivative contracts to protect the value of the Penmont acquisition (see page 102). As at 31 December  
2016, outstanding collar derivative instruments mature over the period of January 2017 to December 2019 and hedge gold production  
of 1.04 million ounces with a floor price of US$1,100 per ounce and capped weighted average price of US$1,423.76 per ounce. In 2016,  
we recognised changes in the time value of the outstanding hedge position, resulting in a US$41.1 million non-cash loss recorded in the 
income statement.
Foreign exchange 
A foreign exchange loss of US$18.4 million was recorded in 2016 as a result of the 20.1% devaluation of the spot Mexican peso/US Dollar 
exchange rate at 31 December. This loss positively compares to the US$36.2 million loss recognised in 2015.
The Group also enters into certain exchange rate derivative instruments as part of a programme to manage its exposure to foreign 
exchange risk associated with the purchase of equipment denominated in Euro (EUR), Swedish krona (SEK) and Canadian dollar (CAD). 
At the end of the year, the total EUR, SEK and CAD outstanding net forward position was EUR 9.35 million, CAD 0.0 and SEK 7.09 million 
with maturity dates from March through September 2017. Volumes that expired during 2016 were EUR 2.31 million with a weighted 
average strike of 1.1250 US Dollar/EUR, CAD 3.86 million with a weighted average strike of 1.2629 CAD/US Dollar and SEK 14.46 million 
with a weighted average strike of 8.41 SEK/US Dollar, which has generated a result of US$46,627, -US$206,810 and -US$18,970 recorded 
in the income statement respectively.
Taxation
Corporate income tax expense of US$259.9 million increased 101.5% over 2015 which resulted mainly from the increase in profit generated 
in 2016. The effective tax rate, excluding the special mining rights, was 36.2% which was above the statutory corporate tax rate of  
30%. This was mainly explained by the devaluation of the Mexican peso against the US dollar, which increased deferred income taxes, 
generated by higher differences arising between the carrying amount of assets and liabilities (denominated in US dollars) and their tax 
bases (denominated in Mexican pesos). Furthermore, US$33.4 million related to the special mining rights was registered in the income 
statement in 2016. Including the effect of mining rights, the effective tax rate was 40.8%. 
Profit for the year
Profit for the year increased from US$69.4 million to US$425.0 million, whilst profit attributable to equity shareholders of the Group 
increased to US$427.0 million, up from US$70.5 million in 2015. 
Excluding the effects of the Silverstream Contract, profit for the year increased from US$50.0 million to US$331.5 million. Similarly, profit 
attributable to equity shareholders of the Group, excluding the Silverstream effects, increased to US$333.5 million, up from US$51.1 million. 110

bank deposits amounted US$200.0 million. In 2015, cash and cash equivalents at 31 December 2015 accounted for US$381.4 million and short-term investments amounted  
to US$118.7 million.
Cash generated by operations before changes in working capital increased by 90.5% to US$1,023.3 million, mainly as a result of the higher 
profits generated in the year. Working capital increased US$10.6 million mainly due to an increase in trade and other receivables resulting 
from the higher volumes sold at higher metal prices (US$39.5 million). This increase in working capital was partly offset by: i) a decrease  
in inventories (US$23.7 million); ii) a decrease in prepayments and other assets (US$0.1 million); and iii) an increase in trade and other 
payables (US$5.1 million).
T axes and employee profit sharing paid increased 150.9% over 2015 to US$114.8 million. 
As a result of the above factors, net cash from operating activities increased significantly, from US$542.9 million in 2015 to US$898.0 
million in 2016.
Other sources of cash were the proceeds of the Silverstream contract of US$47.6 million and capital contributions from minority 
shareholders in subsidiaries of US$7.4 million. 
The above funds were mainly used to purchase property, plant and equipment for a total of US$434.1 million, an 8.6% decrease over 2015. 
This was below the guidance of US$600 million mainly as a result of the delay in commissioning San Julián phase II. Capital expenditures 
for 2016 are further described below:
Purchase of property, plant and equipment
2016 
US$ million
Fresnillo mine 52.8 Mine development and purchase of in-mine equipment which includes

Dividends paid to shareholders of the Group in 2016 totalled US$88.2 million, a 135.1% increase from 2015, in line with our dividend policy 
that includes a consideration of profits generated in the period. The 2016 payment included: i) the final 2015 dividend of US$24.8 million; 
and ii) the 2016 interim dividend paid in September of US$63.4 million.
Financial Review continued 111
Fresnillo plc Annual Report 2016
FRESNILLO TODAY STRATEGIC REPORT CORPORATE GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Net interest of US$21.1 million was paid, mainly reflecting the interest paid in relation with the issuance of the US$800 million principal 
amount of 5.500% Senior Notes.
The sources and uses of funds described above resulted in an increase in net cash of US$412.5 million (net increase in cash and cash 
equivalents), which combined with the US$500.1 million balance at the beginning of the year and the US$0.6 million unfavourable  
effect of the exchange rate resulted in cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments of US$912.0 million at the end of 2016. 
Balance Sheet
Fresnillo plc continues to prioritise and maintain a strong, flexible financial position. 
Cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments increased during the year to US$912.0 million as explained above. 
Inventories decreased 7.9% to US$276.9 million mainly as a result of the decreased inventories of gold deposited on the leaching pads 
at Herradura.
Trade and other receivables of US$286.7 million decreased 6.2% as a result of the decrease in income tax recoverable, partly offset  
by higher metal volumes sold at higher prices which increased receivables.
The change in the value of the Silverstream derivative from US$384.8 million at the beginning of the year to US$467.5 million as of 
31 December 2016 reflects proceeds of US$50.7 million corresponding to 2016 (US$44.8 million in cash and US$5.9 million in receivables) 
and the Silverstream revaluation effect in the income statement of US$133.5 million. 
The net book value of property, plant and equipment was US$2,180.2 million at year end, representing a 1.9% increase over 2015.  
The US$41.6 million increase was mainly explained by the capitalised development works; construction of San Julián; purchase  
of additional in-mine equipment; and construction of leaching pads at Herradura. 
The Group’s total equity was US$2,716.4 million as of 31 December 2016, a 14.4% increase over 2015. This was mainly explained by  
the increase in retained earnings, reflecting the 2015 profit, less dividends paid during the year, and the net unrealised gains on cash  
flow hedges. 
Dividends
Based on the Group’s 2016 performance, the Directors have recommended a final dividend of 21.5 US cents per Ordinary Share, which 
will be paid on 26 May 2017 to shareholders on the register on 28 April 2017. The dividend will be paid in UK pounds sterling unless 
shareholders elect to be paid in US dollars. This is in addition to the interim dividend of 8.6 US cents per share totalling US$63.4 million. Fresnillo plc Annual Report 2016

Chairman’s Letter of Governance
…our collective 
commitment  
to good 
governance… 
remains as strong 
as ever … 
Dear Shareholder,
In 2016, there have been changes in the 
composition of the Board and to our Board 
committees and with close to nine years 
having now elapsed since our IPO, we will 
continue to make changes over the year 
ahead, in order for us to continue to comply 
with the UK Corporate Governance Code  
in relation to the number of independent 
Non-executive Directors on our Board.  
We have given this matter much thought 
during 2016 and have been discussing  
the composition of the Board with some  
of our independent shareholders. 
Our Board committees have all been very 
active during 2016. In the early part of the 
year, the Audit Committee led the work  
of the Board in reviewing the production  
of our first Viability Statement. I am 
pleased to note that our Statement  
was well-received by shareholders and 
other observers. The Audit Committee  
also fulfilled another previously stated 
commitment by undertaking a thorough 
tender exercise for the external auditor to 
take effect for the 2017 financial year end 
audit. At the conclusion of this exercise, the 
Audit Committee unanimously determined 
that Ernst & Y oung LLP is the best firm  
to provide external audit services to the 
Company and recommended this decision 
to the Board, who concurred and their 
re-appointment will be proposed at the 
2017 AGM.
The Remuneration Committee has been 
equally active in preparing for the renewal 
of our Directors’ remuneration policy at  
the 2017 Annual General Meeting. I am 
pleased that independent shareholders 
have always been overwhelmingly 
supportive of the unique Mexico-centric 
approach that we take to executive 
remuneration. Nevertheless, the 
Remuneration Committee has sought  
to ensure that emerging regulatory 
developments and the expectations  
of shareholders are taken into account  
as we develop the remuneration policy;  
but without losing sight of what the  
policy needs to achieve within our 
operational context. 
The Board has taken time during 2016  
to focus on the culture of the Company. 
This is an important topic which has been 
added to the responsibilities of the Health, 
Safety, Environmental and Community 
Relations Committee during the year.  
We know that our target of achieving  
zero fatalities will not be achieved without 
having the right organisational culture to 
underpin that aim and, further, the right 
culture supports the overall effectiveness  
of the organisation. We have seen 
encouraging signs in this regard for 
example in the use of our whistleblowing 
hotline and the completion of online 
anti-bribery and corruption training by 
virtually all our employees during the year. 
As ever, I am grateful to my Board and 
management colleagues for continuing  
to dedicate themselves to meeting  
our collective commitment to good 
governance within Fresnillo plc. As we 
head towards the tenth anniversary of  
our listing on the London Stock Exchange, 
that commitment remains as strong  
as ever.
Y ours faithfully
Mr Alberto Baillères 
Chairman of the Board 114
Fresnillo plc Annual Report 2016
Fresnillo and Corporate Governance
Approach
The Board takes corporate governance seriously 
and considers its responsibilities under the UK 
Corporate Governance Code with care. With 
nearly 75% of its share capital owned by Peñoles, 
it is important to consider corporate governance 
in the context of the Company’s relationship  
with its Parent Company. The Board considers  
this to be a strength rather than a threat because 
it brings the shareholder perspective into the 
Boardroom and creates an additional level of 
accountability for the executive team compared 
to other listed companies. 
The framework for Corporate Governance within Fresnillo plc 
therefore has three features which are relatively unusual for UK 
public companies; in particular:
• There are no Executive Directors on the Board; however the 
Fresnillo Board operates differently from the traditional UK 
board with non-executive and executive directors. The non-
independent and independent Directors on the Board engage 
with the business of the Board in slightly different ways. The 
non-independent Directors have more regular day-to-day 
access to the executive management of Fresnillo plc within  
the Peñoles context and therefore are able to engage with 
proposals put forward by the Executive Committee in a more 
direct way. The independent Non-executive Directors bring  
an external perspective to bear when evaluating proposals  
and conducting the business of the Board. Thus the non-
independent Directors, the independent Non-executive 
Directors and the Executive Committee have complementary 
roles in the business of the Board.
• It is vital that the membership of the Remuneration Committee 
is made up of Non-executive Directors (the majority of whom 
should be independent) who are able to bring the following 
perspectives to the working of the Remuneration Committee:
 – an understanding of shareholder expectations; 
 – an understanding of the evolving remuneration expectations 
of investors on the London Stock Exchange; and
 – an understanding of the general approaches to 
remuneration within the Mexican market.
• Fresnillo plc derives synergistic benefits from services  
provided by Peñoles. Being a part of a group which has 
common requirements across a number of service areas, 
provides opportunities for resources to be shared efficiently 
from a cost point of view. The Audit Committee has therefore 
developed governance processes to ensure that these 
arrangements provide the intended benefits to the  
Company in a transparent and controlled manner.
UK Corporate Governance Code 
Compliance Statement
As a company with a premium listing on the 
London Stock Exchange, Fresnillo is required 
under the FCA Listing Rules to comply with  
the Code Provisions of the 2016 Corporate 
Governance Code (a copy of which can be 
found on the website of the Financial Reporting 
Council www.frc.org.uk) or otherwise explain  
its reasons for non-compliance. 
The following statement is therefore made  
in respect of the year ended 31 December  
2016 in compliance with such requirement.  
The following sections of this report explain 
how the principles of the Code were applied 
and provide cross-references to other sections 
of the report and/or the Company’s website 
(www.fresnilloplc.com) where more detailed 
descriptions are available. 
For the financial year ended 31 December 2016, the Company  
has complied with the provisions of the Code in all areas, save 
in respect of two instances. 
• Code Provision D.1.1 provides that the remuneration 
committee should include provisions that would enable the 
Company to recover sums paid or withhold the payment of 
any sum to senior executives, and specify the circumstances 
in which it would be appropriate to do so. Further explanation 
of the Board’s position on malus and claw-back is set out in 
the Directors’ Remuneration Report on page 145.
• Code Provision D.2.1 provides that the Board should establish 
a remuneration committee of at least three independent 
Non-executive Directors. The composition of the Fresnillo 
Remuneration Committee is made up of three members 
including two independent Non-executive Directors one of 
whom, Charles Jacobs, is the Chairman of the Committee. 
The Chairman of the Company, Alberto Baillères, who was 
not independent at the time of his appointment, is also a 
member. The Board believes that Mr Baillères’ experience 
and knowledge of the Group and the Mexican market  
and his considerable contribution to the Remuneration 
Committee’s deliberations justifies his membership of the 
Remuneration Committee. Mr Baillères is not involved in 
matters concerning his own remuneration.  115

Fresnillo plc Annual Report 2016
FRESNILLO TODAY STRATEGIC REPORT CORPORATE GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Board Structure 
The Board considers the Directors listed as being independent  
on page 117, to be independent in character and judgement.  
For each of these Directors, their circumstances are assessed by 
reference to Provision B.1.1. of the Corporate Governance Code  
(the ‘Code’) and the Board remains satisfied that they are each 
independent when the standards set out in Code Provision B.1.1  
are taken into account.
Additional disclosure on independence
Charles Jacobs is a worldwide senior partner and chairman  
of Linklaters LLP worldwide. Mr Jacobs is not involved in the 
provision of legal or any other services to the Company by 
Linklaters LLP. 
Linklaters LLP was the Company’s UK legal adviser for its London 
IPO in 2008 and is currently one of the Company’s legal advisers 
where any such advice is limited to English law, provided by  
a different partner of Linklaters LLP. Selection of legal advisers  
is not a Board matter and is decided at the management level. 
None of the Fresnillo management sit on the Board. However,  
if any decision were to be made at the Board level regarding 
Linklaters LLP, which has not happened to date, Mr Jacobs would 
excuse himself in accordance with the provisions of the Companies 
Act 2006 relating to Directors’ interests. 
Mr Jacobs does not have, and has not had within the last three 
years, a material business relationship with the Company either 
directly, or as a partner, shareholder, director or senior employee  
of a body that has such a relationship with the Company. By way 
of illustration, the legal fees paid to Linklaters LLP for the last three 
financial years were £90k for the year ended 31 December 2014, 
£177k for the year ended 31 December 2015 and £148k for the  
year ended 31 December 2016. The Audit Committee reviews  
the appropriateness of all professional advisers’ fees each year 
including legal fees as part of their review of ordinary course  
of business expenses.
Fernando Ruiz has, since 2008, been a retired partner and 
consultant in the firm Chevez, Ruiz, Zamarripa y Cia., S.C., a firm 
providing professional services to the Company. Mr Ruiz was  
not involved in the provision of such services to the Company  
by Chevez, Ruiz, Zamarripa y Cia., S.C., prior to his retirement. 
Alberto Tiburcio retired as a Chairman and Chief Executive  
Officer of Mancera S.C., EY’s Mexican firm, which is the Company’s 
auditor, in 2013. Mr Tiburcio was not involved in the provision  
of audit or any other services to the Company by Mancera S.C.  
prior to his retirement.
Guy Wilson retired as a partner of Ernst & Y oung LLP, the 
Company’s auditor in 2008. Mr Wilson was not involved in  
the provision of audit or any other services to the Company  
by Ernst & Y oung LLP prior to his retirement.
The Relationship Agreement
Peñoles has entered into a relationship agreement with  
the Company (the ‘Relationship Agreement’) to ensure that 
relationships between the Fresnillo Group and the Peñoles Group 
are conducted at arm’s length and on normal commercial terms. 
Further information regarding the Relationship Agreement can  
be found on page 123. The non-independent Directors listed  
above have been appointed to the Board by Peñoles pursuant  
to the Relationship Agreement. 
Chairman’s independence
The Chairman, Mr Baillères, is beneficially interested in more  
than 50% of the share capital of the Company through his interest 
in Industrias Peñoles S.A.B. de C. V ., the Company’s controlling 
shareholder. Mr Baillères is also the Chairman of Peñoles and  
other companies within the BAL Group.
Mr Baillères was appointed to the Board by Peñoles pursuant to 
the Relationship Agreement, thus at the time of his appointment 
was not independent. Having been responsible for overseeing  
of the successful development of the Group over many years,  
the Board considers that his continued involvement as its Non-
executive Chairman is very important to the continued success  
of the Company.
The Relationship Agreement continues to provide a transparent 
governance system, which ensures that the Company benefits  
from Mr Baillères’ leadership and experience whilst being able  
to demonstrate to other shareholders that the Fresnillo Group is 
capable of carrying on its business independently. In particular, the 
Relationship Agreement ensures that transactions and relationships 
between the Fresnillo Group and its controlling shareholder are at 
arm’s length and on competitive commercial terms. 
Board roles
The separate roles of Chairman and of the Chief Executive Officer 
are recognised and the requirements for these roles have been 
specified in writing and agreed by the Board in the Statement  
of Responsibilities. Octavio Alvídrez, the Chief Executive Officer,  
is not currently a member of the Board.
Charles Jacobs, the Senior Independent Director is available to 
shareholders if they have concerns that have not been resolved 
through the normal channels of Chairman, Chief Executive  
Officer, Chief Financial Officer or Head of Investor Relations.  
The composition of the Board has been structured to ensure  
that no one individual can dominate the decision-making 
processes of the Board.

Board process
The Board supervises the management of the Group’s activities, 
including the implementation of both the Group’s long-term  
plans and commercial strategy. In addition, the Board provides 
leadership to the Fresnillo Group setting the key values by which 
the Group will continue to operate. The Board has a formal 
schedule of matters reserved for its approval which includes 
approvals of major expenditure, investments and key policies.  
The schedule is annually reviewed to keep it up to date with any 
regulatory developments. The last review and revision was in 
October 2016.
All meetings of the Board are held in Mexico. The Board meets  
a minimum of four times a year and has a well-established 
programme of meetings.
The Company Secretary prepares the agenda for the Chairman’s 
approval, in consultation with the Chief Executive Officer and the 
Chief Financial Officer. Papers are prepared by members of the 
Executive Committee to be presented to the Board for discussion. 
When preparing such papers, the factors set out in section 172  
of the Companies Act 2006 are taken into account. Any matters 
that only require Executive Committee approval are nevertheless 
reported to the Board. Members of the Executive Committee meet 
with non-independent Directors prior to each Board meeting to 
review proposals due to be submitted to the whole Board. Such 
review discussions are minuted and copies of the minutes are 
circulated to all of the Directors.
Board members usually receive Board papers five days prior to 
meetings in order to enable the Directors adequate time to study 
and consider the documents. 
Members of the Executive Committee, led by the Chief Executive 
Officer, are present at all of the Board meetings, and present all  
of the papers on operational and financial matters. The only 
exceptions to this are discussions over management succession, 
and the annual Board evaluation report discussion. At every 
meeting, the Board considers the following items:
• Directors interests.
• Chief Executive’s Report.
• Financial Report.
• Board Committee Reports.
• Risk, Internal Control and Anti Bribery and Corruption update.
• Investor Relations and Corporate Communications update.
• Legal and Company Secretarial Report (including  
litigation update).
Between Board meetings Directors are provided with  
information on important developments and issues such as: 
• Reports on safety and fatalities.
• Important developments re projects/transactions.
• Distribution of relevant information on the precious  
metals sector.
Directors have the right to raise concerns at Board meetings, and 
can ask for those concerns to be recorded in the Board minutes. 
The advice and services of the Company Secretary (whose 
appointment and removal is a matter reserved for the Board) are 
also available to the Directors. The Group has also established a 
procedure which enables, in relevant circumstances, Directors to 
obtain independent professional advice at the Company’s expense.
Corporate Code of Conduct
The Corporate Code of Conduct was updated during 2016, serving 
as a guideline for all Directors, executives, employees and related 
third parties (clients, suppliers and the community) to act in 
accordance with the Code. The Code helps to ensure a foundation 
of values, and works as a guide for behaviour that encourages  
an environment of ethics and responsibility for the benefit of our 
stakeholders. It serves to complement the internal and external 
regulations already in force and also to establish corrective 
measures for anyone who fails to comply with the provisions  
of the Code.
The Fresnillo Board and culture 
During 2016, Fresnillo continued its focus on the organisational 
culture and ethics programme. The Board received a presentation 
on proposed management initiatives to embed strong ethics in the 
culture and as a core competence in the organisational structure  
to enable the Company to achieve its key targets, for example zero 
fatalities as a safety objective.
A four-pronged programme encompassing the entire workforce 
has been implemented, aimed at reinforcing the desired ethical 
behaviours through: (i) sponsorship and leadership for cultural 
change from senior management; (ii) promoting ethical decision 
making (iii) managing incentives; and (iv) developing an open 
culture which encourages whistleblowing.
The Board will receive regular updates on the initiatives and  
the metrics for monitoring of the programme.
The HSECR Committee has been given responsibility for 
overseeing the programme on behalf of the Board, which  
will review the progress of the programme in detail at one  
of its meetings each year.

During 2016, which was the third year in the cycle, the Company used an internally facilitated evaluation focusing on the emerging issues

particularly in relation to the performance 
and risk profile of key projects. 
Further improvements and refinements to 
the Board papers have been made in 2016.
The Board members continue to monitor 
the suitability and format of the papers 
during 2016.
A further review of key Board papers  
will be conducted in 2017 with assistance 
from four Non-executive Directors. 
The Audit Committee to review a  
protocol for post-implementation reviews

item at the October Board meeting. 
Sustainability Strategy was reviewed  
at the April Board meeting.
The Board recognise the importance  
of discussions and presentations on the

Enable Directors to understand the control 
and culture of the organisation more easily.
A presentation on the organisational and

Board meeting and the Corporate Code  
of Conduct has been updated.
Continue to review and develop in 2017.
Culture and ethics metrics to be further 
developed and included in the CEO’s  
report to the Board.
In 2017, Fresnillo will be initiating a new three-year Board evaluation cycle, with an externally facilitated Board evaluation exercise.
Audit Committee evaluation
The Audit Committee has undertaken an internally facilitated evaluation in 2016, details of which are set out in the Audit Committee 
Report on page 137.
Other committee evaluations
The Nomination and Remuneration Committees undertake self-evaluation on an annual basis but given the relatively straightforward 
nature of their work, have not considered it necessary to use external facilitation for their reviews. Such reviews were conducted by both 
of these Committees in 2016.
Individual performance reviews
Non-executive Directors occasionally meet the Chairman without executives being present. The independent Non-executive Directors 
meet annually in order to evaluate the performance of the Chairman. On the back of this meeting, the Senior Independent Director 
discusses the views of the independent Directors with the Chairman. The Independent Directors held this meeting in 2016 after  
the February meeting and took the 2015 Board Evaluation review into account in their discussions and feedback to the Chairman.
Board development 
Senior management present on the Group’s strategic initiatives to provide the Non-executive Directors with more information about  
the broader context to the Company’s activities. In addition there is a regular distribution of industry briefings on technical, market and 
sector issues.
Directors are encouraged to visit the Company’s mines to familiarise themselves with the Fresnillo Group’s operations. 
Briefings were arranged for all Directors from the Company’s advisers. These include presentations which were aimed at familiarising  
the Directors with the duties and responsibilities as Directors of a UK listed company. In addition, the Chairman meets with Directors  
to discuss any training or development needs. These usually take place as part of Board or committee evaluation exercises.
Board performance evaluation
In order to evaluate its own effectiveness, the Board undertakes annual appraisals using a combination of externally facilitated and 
internally run evaluations over a three-year cycle. The cycle of the Board’s evaluations is summarised as follows:  123
Fresnillo plc Annual Report 2016
FRESNILLO TODAY STRATEGIC REPORT CORPORATE GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Relationship Agreement
The Relationship Agreement complies with the independence provisions set out in Listing Rule 6.1.4DR for controlled companies. 
The Company has complied with the independence provisions included in the Relationship Agreement during the financial year  
ended 31 December 2016. As far as the Company is aware, such provisions have been complied with during the financial year ended 
31 December 2016 by Peñoles and/or any of its associates.
Peñoles has also undertaken not to exercise its voting rights to amend the Articles of Association in a way which would be inconsistent 
with the provisions of the agreement. It has also agreed to abstain from voting on any resolution to approve a ‘related party transaction’ 
(as defined in paragraph 11.1.5 R of the Listing Rules) involving any member of the Peñoles Group.
The following diagram summarises the approach taken to identify and manage related party transactions. 
Conflicts of interest
The Group requires that Directors complete a ‘Director’s List’. The list sets out details of situations where each Director’s interest may 
conflict with those of the Company (situational conflicts). Each Director has re-submitted their list as at 31 December 2016 for the Board  
to consider and authorise any new situational conflicts identified in the re-submitted lists.

How this is managed
If a Director is interested in a company which could potentially enter into 
transactions with a Fresnillo plc Group company, the Board will normally consider 
that interest under its arrangements for authorising conflicts of interest under  
s175 of Companies Act.
How this is managed
The Executive Committee will seek to ensure that the best possible terms  
are achieved for a proposed transaction and that they are verified by industry 
benchmarking reports or independent valuation/assessment.
How this is managed
The Audit Committee reviews the key terms of major transactions which are verified 
as to price and quality with external consultants or independent benchmarking 
where possible.
How this is managed
Under the Relationship Agreement, the Independent Directors must approve any 
transaction with the Peñoles Group and its associates without the non-independent 
Directors voting. 
Ongoing monitoring of Directors’ interests and related parties of the Company 
provides the information to determine if a related party approval is required  
for a proposed transaction.

with a significant shift since IPO in 2008 from a predominantly  
UK shareholder base.
Relations with Shareholders
The Board continually monitors the interests of the Company’s 
minority shareholders, in order to ensure that those interests are 
being properly respected, and that they are aligned with those of 
the major shareholders. As explained on page 123 procedures for 
dealing with transactions with related parties, as well as Directors’ 
conflicts of interest, are repeatedly appraised and maintained by 
the Board.
The Company has an office in London where the Head of Investor 
Relations is based. During 2016, the Group implemented a strong 
communications and investor relations programme, as detailed  
in the diagram below. 
The Company plans to hold meetings with major shareholders  
and analysts at least twice a year. This is done to give the investors 
and analysts the chance to discuss the results of the Group whilst 
also giving them an opportunity to raise any queries or concerns 
they may have. The Senior Independent Director, Charles Jacobs 
intends to continue to attend such meetings in order to sustain 
good communications between shareholders and the Company. 
The Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer also  
meet with analysts, conference calls after production reports  
and shareholders by participating in the major roadshows after 
preliminary and half yearly results are announced. They are joined 
by other members of the Executive Committee for some of these 
visits. The table below outlines some examples of the discussion 
points at such meetings and the response from the Company.

2016 Annual General Meeting
At the 2016 Annual General Meeting, all resolutions put to 
shareholders were passed by a majority. As such, the Company  
did not deem it necessary to specifically engage with shareholders 
over any of the items of business of the AGM. In accordance with 
changes to the UK Listing Rules applicable to companies with a 
controlling shareholder, the resolutions relating to the re-election  
of the independent Non-executive Directors required approval  
by a majority of votes cast by independent shareholders as well  
as all the shareholders of the Company. 
Further to the Code provisions, details of proxy voting are 
presented at the AGM and final figures are announced to the 
London Stock Exchange and uploaded to the Company’s website 
as soon practicable after the AGM. 
2017 Annual General Meeting
The Company’s ninth Annual General Meeting will be held on 
23 May 2017 at 12.00 noon. The business of the Annual General 
Meeting (‘AGM’) will be conducted in accordance with the 
provisions B.7.1, B.7.2, E.2.1 and E.2.2 of the Code. The Chairman  
of the Board and the chairmen of each of the Board committees 
will be available to answer questions put forward to them by 
shareholders of the Company. The Annual Report and Accounts 
and the Notice of the Annual General Meeting will be sent to 
shareholders at least 20 working days prior to the date of the 
meeting. In planning the business of each AGM, the Board takes 
account of institutional shareholder guidelines on pre-emption 
rights, share buy-backs and shareholder rights in relation to 
general meetings when drafting the usual resolutions dealing with 
those matters. In each case, resolutions are presented to the AGM 
to give the Board flexibility to respond to market developments.
Authority to purchase own shares
The Company was authorised by a shareholders’ resolution  
passed at the Annual General Meeting held in May 2016 to 
purchase up to 10% of its issued Ordinary Share capital. Any shares 
which have been bought back may be held as treasury shares or,  
if not so held, must be cancelled immediately upon completion  
of the purchase, thereby reducing the amount of the Company’s 
issued and authorised share capital. This authority will expire at the 
forthcoming Annual General Meeting and a resolution to renew  
the authority for a further year will be proposed. No shares were 
purchased by the Company during the year. 126

Nominations Committee Report
We remain strongly 
committed to the principle 
of equality of opportunity 
when considering new 
appointments to the 
Board and I hope that we 
will be able to demonstrate 
that commitment when 
future board appointments 
are made. 
Mr Alberto Baillères
Chairman of the Nominations Committee
Dear Shareholder,
During 2016, there were changes on the Board of Directors of 
Fresnillo plc with two of our Directors resigning due to other 
commitments. The Nominations Committee has for some time 
been mindful that we are in a phase during which the refreshing  
of the Board needs to take place, particularly as some of our 
independent Non-executive Directors reach the ninth anniversary 
of their appointment. The possible options for further 
appointments to the Board have therefore been the principal  
focus of the Committee during 2016. As part of that process,  
the Committee made a recommendation to the Board to appoint 
Alberto Tiburcio as an additional independent Non-executive 
Director and I am particularly pleased to welcome him to the 
Board and as a member of the Audit Committee. Whilst we  
are mindful that further new appointments to the Board will  
be required, our primary objective in this process will be the 
appointment of the right people at the right time.
During 2016, we have also considered the membership of our 
Board committees as a result of which Arturo Fernandez has now 
taken over as Chairman of the Health, Safety, Environment and 
Community Relations Committee. In addition, Charles Jacobs  
was appointed as the Senior Independent Director. I am grateful  
to Guy Wilson for having undertaken that role previously.
Although one of our female Directors left the Board in 2016,  
we remain strongly committed to the principle of equality of 
opportunity when considering new appointments to the Board 
and I hope that we will be able to demonstrate that commitment 
when future Board appointments are made.
Y ours faithfully
Mr Alberto Baillères
Chairman of the Nominations Committee
Membership
The members of the Nominations Committee are Alberto Baillères 
(Chairman of the Committee), Barbara Garza Lagüera and 
Fernando Ruiz. The majority of the members of the Nominations 
Committee are, therefore, independent Non-executive Directors. 
Role
The Nominations Committee is responsible for making 
recommendations to the Board on the structure, size and 
composition of the Board and its committees and succession 
planning for the Directors and other senior executives. Before making 
appointments of new Directors, the Committee is responsible  
for evaluating the balance of skills, knowledge and experience  
on the Board and identifying and nominating suitable candidates.
The Nominations Committee has approved Board Appointments 
and Board Diversity Policies which provide the framework  
for the Nominations Committee and the Board’s approach  
to Board appointments.
Attendance
Mr Alberto Baillères 2/2
Mr Fernando Ruiz 2/2
Ms Barbara Garza Lagüera 1/2
Ms Garza Lagüera was unable to attend one meeting of the 
Committee because she was presented with an international 
award for her cultural work in Spain on the same day as the 
Committee meeting. 127

FRESNILLO TODAY STRATEGIC REPORT CORPORATE GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Nominations Committee
Board Appointments Policy and Process in summary
The Nominations Committee and Board are committed to the 
principle of appointments to the Board being made on the basis  
of merit. The Committee continues to consider the composition of 
the Board with a focus on its continued commitment to diversity.
The criteria for determining the composition of the Board and 
future Board appointments continue to be based on:
• Relationship Agreement requirements for appointments to the 
Board by Peñoles.
• The Company’s leading position as a precious metals miner 
in Mexico.
• The Company’s inclusion in the FTSE 100 Index.
• The specific functions on Board committees which independent 
Directors will be required to fulfil.
• The provisions set out in the current terms of reference of the 
Nominations Committee.
The Nominations Committee does not use open advertising or 
retain any external consultants when making new appointments  
to the Board as it is considered unnecessary considering the 
Company’s contacts within Mexico. 
Board Diversity Policy in summary and progress
All Board appointments are made on merit. The Board recognises 
and embraces the benefits of having a diverse Board; particularly 
the value that different perspectives and experience bring to the 
quality of Board debate and decision-making. There are certain 
considerations which are taken into account in considering the 
composition of the Board such as: background and experience; 
age; gender; and shareholder perspectives. 
The Board believes that setting targets for the number of people 
from a particular background or gender is not the most effective 
approach to take. The Board will therefore look to follow the 
principles of this policy rather than specified quotas or targets.  
Of the six new Directors that have been appointed to the Board 
since 2012, two have been women, demonstrating the Nominations 
Committee and the Board’s commitment to gender diversity.  
One member of the Nominations Committee itself is female. 
The Board recognises that very few women are attracted to mining 
engineering and geology academic programmes in Mexico and,  
in view of the stage of development of Mexico, the participation  
of women in the labour force as a whole is still relatively low.  
This will take time to rectify but it is changing and the Company  
is committed to hiring and developing women with educational 
training in mining engineering, geology, finance and accounting. 
Full versions of the Board Appointments Policy and Process and 
the Board Diversity Policy, can be found on the Company’s website 
(www.fresnilloplc.com). 
Activity during 2016
The Nominations Committee met twice during the year.
Board appointments
The Nominations Committee is committed to a progressive 
refreshing of the Board, as recommended by Code Provision  
B.2.3 of the UK Corporate Governance Code.
There have been three changes to the Board during 2016, Mr Alberto 
Tiburcio was appointed to the board and Ms María Asunción 
Aramburuzabala and Mr Rafael MacGregor resigned during the year . 
The Nominations Committee has continued to discuss future Board 
appointments with emphasis being placed on the gender balance of 
the Board and the independence of future appointees to the Board. 
Committee membership
Following some changes to the membership of the Board 
committees in 2016 as a result of changes to the membership of the 
Board itself, the Nominations Committee reviewed the composition 
and effectiveness of the Board committees in 2016 and was satisfied 
that the Committees are working well. The Nominations Committee 
approved the appointment of Arturo Fernandez as Chairman of the 
Health, Safety, Environment and Community Relations Committee, 
following the resignation of Rafael MacGregor , and it will appoint 
another member of that Committee to replace Maria Asuncion 
Aramburuzabala in due course. 
Executive succession planning
Each year, the Nominations Committee reviews a schedule  
of possible successors for all the positions on the Executive 
Committee (Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer, Vice 
President of Exploration and Chief Operating Officer). This review 
considers both short-term emergency and long-term planning 
scenarios. Any actions needed to support the development of 
potential long-term successors are discussed. The Nominations 
Committee also monitors the long-term evolution of the 
membership of the Board as a whole. These matters were  
all discussed by the Nominations Committee in 2016 and it is 
satisfied with the actions that are being taken to support this.
Other Nominations Committee Activity
The Nominations Committee also considered the following matters:
• The appointment of Charles Jacobs as Senior Independent 
Director.
• Approval of the 2016 Nominations Committee Report prior  
to publication.
• The time commitment required from each Director.
• The proposed re-election of each of the continuing Directors  
at the AGM.
• A self-evaluation exercise (which concluded that the 
Nominations Committee is functioning well).
The terms of reference of the Nominations Committee are 
available on the Company’s website at www.fresnilloplc.com.
The letters of appointment for the Non-executive Directors are 
made available for inspection at the Company’s registered office, 
during normal business hours. 128

Audit Committee Report
We are performing our 
core duties in relation to 
financial reporting, external 
audit, risk and internal 
control, internal audit, 
whistleblowing and related 
parties, albeit that we 
recognise the necessity 
to strive for continuous 
improvement. 
Guy Wilson
Chairman of the Audit Committee
Dear Shareholder,
This year has seen further increases in the responsibilities of Audit 
Committees following implementation of the EU Audit Reform and 
UK Financial Reporting Council’s guidance. In addition, a significant 
amount of time was involved in the conduct of an efficient and 
effective audit tender process, the details and outcome of which 
are set out later in this report. 
Last year, in addition to our primary task of the oversight of 
financial accounting and reporting together with internal controls, 
concentrating on the financial judgements in the financial 
statements, I outlined four priorities for your Audit Committee  
in 2016. I now comment on progress so far in the table below.
In the light of an external evaluation of your Audit Committee  
in 2017, we conducted a thorough internal evaluation using a 
lengthy questionnaire which was completed by all of us, the Chief 
Financial Officer and the Financial Controller, Internal Audit and  
EY , our external auditor. The conclusions of this evaluation are  
that we are performing our core duties in relation to financial 
reporting, external audit, risk and internal control, internal audit, 
whistleblowing and related parties well, albeit that we recognise 
the necessity to strive for continuous improvement. We did, 
however, identify four activities for us to concentrate on in 2017 
which are set out in detail later in this report. In addition, the Board 
have also asked the Audit Committee to review its post-investment 
review process.
I had intended to visit our new operation San Julián this year  
but our additional workload made that impractical. I do, however, 
intend to go this year with the benefit that I will be able to go once 
the second and final stage of the operation is complete.
In closing, we have welcomed Alberto Tiburcio as a fourth member 
of our Committee and together with Fernando Ruiz and Jaime 
Serra, I believe we are now an even more effective Audit Committee.
Y ours faithfully
Guy Wilson
Chairman of the Audit Committee
2016 priorities Progress
Continuing to encourage management to challenge the 
assumptions underpinning the long-term viability of the  
Group to ensure that the Board can remain confident  
about the Group’s long-term viability.
The assumptions underpinning the various scenarios remain sound, 
but we have encouraged management to expand the statement  
to explain what management and the Board would do in the event 
of any such scenario occurring.
Continuing to encourage management to enhance the 
transparency of the effectiveness of the internal controls  
over the identified risks to enable the Board to have continued 
confidence in our process.
Management has achieved a satisfactory level of understanding  
of the risks and related controls throughout all our operations, 
moreover, the Board now receives a quarterly report of significant 
movements in the risk profile and a summary of any significant 
control weaknesses identified by internal audit.
Continue to challenge management’s progress to implement  
IT improvements to underpin the corporate strategy and  
ensure that such enhancements are cost effective.
Good progress has been made in the management of both 
recurring annual maintenance expenditure and the cost of new 
improvements. Further work, however needs to be done to clarify 
the risk profiles and related internal controls in order to achieve 
relevant industry standards.
Conduct an effective and efficient audit tender. See full details of the process and outcome set out later  
in this report. 129

 Financial Reporting
First half of 2016 Second half of 2016
• Review of the financial statements for the year ending 
31 December 2015 and Annual Report.
• Review of approach to T ax and PTU.
• Review of Payments to Government disclosure.
• Review of interim financial statements for 2016 and Interim 
Announcement.
• Review of 2016 year end reporting plan. 
• Review of plan for preparing the financial statements  
and Annual Report for the year ending 31 December 2016  
(early 2017).
In undertaking its review of the 2016 half-yearly report, the Audit 
Committee sought to ensure that there was consistency between 
the policies and judgements used in preparing the full-year and 
half-year financial statements. Prior to recommending both the 
half-year and the full-year financial statements to the Board  
for approval, the Audit Committee, with the assistance of 
management and EY , identified a number of areas of particular 
focus. These are outlined in the table below. 
In 2015, the Audit Committee reported specifically on its review  
of hedging, impairment and going concern as judgemental  
areas. These are aspects of financial reporting which the Audit 
Committee consider to be less significant as judgemental areas in 
2016 because the Company is no longer hedging Mexican peso/
US dollar exchange rate differences and higher metal prices have 
substantially increased the level of headroom for both the 
impairment and going concern tests.
Significant judgement areas in 2016
Mineral reserves and resources
The estimation of mineral reserves and resources requires significant 
judgement not only in respect of mineral physically in place but also 
metal price and cost assumptions determine the cut-off grade for 
identifying economically viable ore bodies.
Reserves and resources are a primary driver of Fresnillo’s market 
valuation and a significant input into assessments of depreciation 
and impairment. As a result, inaccuracies in the estimation of reserves 
and resources would lead to broad implications across the Annual 
Report and Accounts.
The Committee reviewed the report by SRK Consulting (the 
Company’s independent reserves and resources auditor) on the 
reserves and resources (excluding Silverstream) and considered 
the year-on-year changes in SRK’s estimation of reserves  
and resources quantities. The Committee also reviewed the 
methodology used by EY to assess the SRK reporting and the 
commentary on reserves and resources within the Annual Report.
The Audit Committee is satisfied that the review process itself 
and that the Company’s disclosures are appropriate.
 See pages 242 to 246
Silverstream
The Silverstream contract is a derivative financial instrument  
which must be reflected at fair value at each balance sheet date.  
The fair value is most sensitive to the timing and volume of forecast 
production derived from the reserves and resources and production 
profile of the Sabinas mine, the estimated future silver price and  
the discount rate.
The Silverstream contract represents a large asset on our balance 
sheet which can also, as a result of movements in metals prices,  
give rise to large, albeit non-cash, amounts in our income statement. 
The Audit Committee reviewed the inputs into the estimation  
of the valuation at the balance sheet date and associated 
sensitivity analysis. It also reviewed the disclosures relating to  
the Silverstream contract and discussed with EY their procedures 
for auditing the accuracy of the model used in the valuation and 
the key assumptions therein. 
The Audit Committee is satisfied that the related gain  
on the Silverstream Contract is acceptable and that  
the accounting treatment and disclosure in the financial 
statements is appropriate.
 See note 14 to the financial statements 131
Fresnillo plc Annual Report 2016
FRESNILLO TODAY STRATEGIC REPORT CORPORATE GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Related party transactions including revenue recognition
Fresnillo has a controlling shareholder and as a result has  
very strong ties both to Peñoles and the broader BAL group. 
There is a risk that related party relationships could be taken 
advantage of to manipulate earnings or otherwise distort our 
financial position.
Furthermore related party transaction disclosure requirements allow 
investors to understand the Company’s exposure to inappropriate 
related party transactions and there is a risk that disclosures in our 
financial statements could be inaccurate or incomplete.
Every year, the Audit Committee scrutinises the probity of all 
major related party transactions to ensure that they are entered 
into transparently and fairly to all shareholders. (See the section 
of this report headed ‘Transactions with Related Parties’).
The Audit Committee reviews EY’s procedures to ensure revenue 
is recognised accurately and the relevant disclosures in the 
Annual Report, to ensure that they are consistent with the 
information it is presented with during the year.
The Audit Committee was satisfied with the accounting 
treatment and disclosure of Related Party Transactions  
in the financial statements.
 See note 27 to the financial statements
T axation and PTU
The taxation of mining companies in Mexico has been the subject  
of much attention and governmental action in Mexico. In accordance 
with the Mexican legislation, companies in Mexico are subject to pay 
for employee profit sharing (‘PTU’) equivalent to 10% of the taxable 
income of each fiscal year.
There is a risk that deductions taken when calculating tax and  
PTU charges may be challenged, and that any resulting exposures  
to payable taxation and PTU may not have been provided for 
appropriately. In addition, certain tax assets and liabilities are 
denominated in Mexican pesos and may be revalued during  
the period, resulting in foreign exchange gains or losses.
The Audit Committee seeks to ensure that shareholders have 
adequate information to conclude that the stated charges for  
PTU and taxation are fair and reasonable.
In reviewing both taxation and PTU, the Committee reviews  
all the significant judgements and adjustments applied in 
determining profit subject to taxation or PTU for each subsidiary 
which are clearly set out in papers prepared by management. 
The Committee challenges management’s and EY’s views and 
ascertains the degree to which such adjustments are supported 
by internal and/or external subject matter experts.
The Audit Committee was satisfied that the stated charges  
for taxation and PTU are fair and reasonable under current 
Mexican tax law and financial reporting standards.
 See note 10 to the financial statements
Licences and land title
The Audit Committee consider whether the Company continues to 
have a robust process to ensure that all required legal documentation 
is completed correctly on acquisition of land titles particularly in light 
of recent litigation and ejido activity. The specific questions arising 
from this are: (i) whether there are factors which may give rise to 
asset impairment; (ii) whether the level of legal provisions and 
narrative disclosures in the accounts are adequate; and (iii)  
whether/when the Group would be able to resume operations  
at Soledad-Dipolos.
The Audit Committee has oversight over the progress of the  
land title review and throughout the year has received verbal  
and written reports from the Company’s Head of Legal on  
the process.
The review is largely complete. T o date, apart from the issues 
arising from ongoing ejido litigation (on which the Audit 
Committee has received regular updates from the Head of Legal), 
which are being addressed, nothing significant has emerged.
The Audit Committee is satisfied that the amount of the  
mining assets at 31 December 2016 is not overstated when 
taking into consideration the currently available information 
and that relevant disclosures throughout the Annual Report  
are appropriate.
 See note 12 to the financial statements
Ensuring that the Annual Report is fair, balanced and understandable
Two weeks prior to the Annual Report and financial statements for the year-ended 31 December 2016 being approved by the Board, 
members of the Audit Committee and other Directors reviewed an earlier draft enabling them to assess whether the information was 
consistent with their understanding of the Company’s business. Suggested changes put forward by those Directors based on knowledge 
obtained through Board and Audit Committee papers and discussion and their other interactions with management are also taken into 
account in the final version of the Annual Report. These included observations on the strategic report arising from a comparison with  
the disclosures in the financial statements to ensure consistency. The Board therefore considers that, taken as a whole, it is fair, balanced 
and understandable.  132

External auditor tender
During 2016 a rigorous tender process for the external audit for the financial year beginning 1 January 2017 was conducted (see the 
section headed external audit tender, below).
Appointment of the external auditor
In February 2016, the Audit Committee considered and 
recommended the re-appointment of the external auditor, EY , to 
the Board prior to the Company’s Annual General Meeting. This 
review took into account the results of the auditor assessment 
process, the quality of the work and communication by the 
external auditor and the level of audit fees. The Audit Partner is 
Daniel Trotman and he has been the Audit Partner for two years.
External audit tender
During 2016, the Audit Committee undertook an external audit 
tender exercise. The existing auditor, EY was invited to tender in 
the process as this was permitted by current legislation given that 
EY had only completed nine years as external auditor. Recognising 
that two of the members of the Audit Committee were previously 
employed by EY and the existing relationship which the Company 
has with EY , the Audit Committee designed the tender exercise to 
be robust, objective and transparent. Thus, the process consisted 
of the following steps:
March 2016 The Chairman of the Audit Committee wrote to leading institutional shareholders inviting their input into the 
tender process.
May 2016 Introductory meetings with all four tenderers in London to explain process and provide information about the 
Company and the audit.
June 2016 Data Room was opened and requests for information processed.
August 2016 Meetings with each of the tenderers:
(i) In London with the Audit Committee Chairman and Company Secretary to explain the Audit Committee 
process and governance framework.
(ii) In Mexico City with (a) the Audit Committee members; (b) the Internal Audit and Risk Management team; 
(c) the Chief Financial Officer, Group Financial Controller, the Head of IT and the Assistant VP, Planning 
and Executive Information and (d) the Chief Executive Officer, Chief Operating Officer and Head  
of Exploration.
September 2016 • Receipt of written proposals. 
• Short-list of tenderers agreed for oral presentations.
• Oral presentations given in Mexico City.
October 2016 Formal decision made by Audit Committee, taking account of input from members of the Executive 
Committee, internal audit and the finance team, and its recommendation made to the Fresnillo plc Board.

Fresnillo plc Annual Report 2016
FRESNILLO TODAY STRATEGIC REPORT CORPORATE GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Four firms, Deloitte, KPMG, PwC and the incumbent auditor, EY , 
were invited to submit tenders. In order to ensure that the process 
was as objective as possible, the Audit Committee involved a 
number of key stakeholders who work with the external auditor. 
These included the Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer, 
the Group Financial Controller, the Head of IT, Assistant Vice 
President, Planning and Executive Information, the Head of Risk, 
the Head of Internal Audit and Internal Audit Manager. All of the 
stakeholders involved in the process were invited to rank/score 
each of the tenderers against each of the following criteria. These 
marks were taken into account as part of the evaluation process.
• Experience in mining, with precious metals expertise preferred, 
in companies of a similar size and complexity.
• London team experienced with FTSE 100 companies and 
associated regulation and governance (preferably with some 
who can speak Spanish) supported by local Mexican team.
• Quality of partners in UK and Mexico and quality of their teams, 
evidenced by firm and external evaluations. Issues from the 
FRC’s Audit Quality Review (AQR) of the firm relevant to audit 
of Fresnillo and details of internal processes used for quality 
assurance. Quality and experience of other technical resources 
that may be used on assignments.
• How the audit approach would be aligned to Fresnillo’s specific 
circumstances.
• Communication skills.
• Expected continuity of team.
• Proposed hours and fees in detail with methodology for  
future years.
• Independence of firm and details of internal practices to ensure 
continuing compliance with independence requirements and 
freedom from conflicts of interest.
• Plan for transition and experience of such transitions with 
similar companies.
• Experience of co-ordination with Parent Company 
management and auditors and methodology for doing so.
Fresnillo external audit tender evaluation criteria
Following the submission of the written proposals, the Audit 
Committee unanimously concluded that Deloitte and EY 
demonstrated better the resources, expertise, quality control and 
audit approach to deliver a high quality audit service to Fresnillo and 
were invited to give oral presentations, following which, a formal 
recommendation to re-appoint EY as the external auditor was made 
to the Board and accepted in October 2016. The appointment will 
be presented to shareholders for confirmation at the 2017 AGM. 
In making its recommendation to the Board to re-appoint EY for 
the 2017 year end audit, the Audit Committee and management 
particularly noted that EY have a strong understanding of the 
mining sector and its various audit-related issues and challenges. 
They also took into account the strength and experience of  
the EY team both in London and in Mexico. In addition, EY had 
identified ways in which the audit process could continue to  
evolve and innovate as part of their proposal and have committed 
to implement those recommendations.
Quality and independence of the external auditor and non-audit 
services policy
The Audit Committee is mindful of its responsibility to ensure  
that the external auditor maintains its independence and 
objectivity and is appropriately qualified with sufficient resources 
and expertise to fulfil the role. During the external audit tender 
process all of these aspects were considered. More specifically  
in the context of the 2016 audit, the Audit Committee specifically 
reviewed, and is satisfied with, the independence of EY as  
the external auditor based on disclosures provided by EY in 
accordance with UK Ethical Standards for the audit profession. 
Following the implementation of the EU Audit Reform Directive, 
the Audit Committee reviewed its policy for the provision of 
non-audit services to the Fresnillo Group by the external auditor 
(the ‘Revised Policy’, which was effective from 1 January 2017).  
This resulted in minor changes being agreed to the Policy to 
ensure that it conforms to the new Ethical Standard published  
by the Financial Reporting Council. Under the Revised Policy  
the engagement of the external auditor to provide statutory audit 
services, certain assurance, and due diligence services with fees  
of less than US$5,000 is pre-approved. Any engagement of the 
external auditor to provide permitted services above US$5,000  
is subject to the specific approval of the Audit Committee.
In October 2016, the Audit Committee reviewed the non-audit 
work undertaken by EY during the year. The Committee was 
satisfied that the level of work was appropriate and that the nature 
of the work would not compromise EY’s objectivity in respect of 
future audit work. Details of the fees paid to EY during the year  
as shown in note 28 to the financial statements.
  Risk and Internal Control
During the course of 2016, the Audit Committee undertook the following activities in relation to risk, internal control, going concern  
and viability:
Governance Area Activities
Risk • Quarterly reviews of the risk matrix and Key Risk Indicators (‘KRIs’)
• Half-yearly reviews of the Principal Risks and Uncertainties.
Internal control • Consideration of plan for the year-end review of the system of internal controls.
• Quarterly review of internal control monitoring reports to the Board 
• Annual review of the system of internal controls.
 Financial • Annual treasury policy review.
• Review of reserves and resources data and report from SRK.
 Non-financial • Quarterly review of Anti-Bribery and Corruption Programme (ABAC).
• Quarterly report on legal matters (land titles and litigation).
• Regular reviews of IT Governance, IT Strategy, Cyber-security and Data Protection.
• Annual review of compliance with mining licence conditions.
Going concern • Half-yearly reviews of the Going Concern Statement and supporting papers.
Viability • Review of the process for preparing the Viability Statement including scenario planning 
assumptions and supporting paper.
• Review of the draft Viability Statement prior to submission to Board for approval. 134
Fresnillo plc Annual Report 2016
Audit Committee Report continued
Risk
Management will continue to build on the existing risk management 
framework, seeking to enhance risk governance and management 
across the business in line with the changes to the UK Corporate 
Governance Code. In order to support the Board in monitoring the 
normal risk management activities, the Audit Committee reviewed 
management’s activities to:
• develop an ongoing continuous monitoring process consisting 
of validating the effectiveness of current controls;
• continue promoting ownership of risk mitigation and associated 
controls among the process owners at the business unit level 
(being the first line of defence) through their periodic reporting 
on the effectiveness of controls; and
• consider how our risk management environment is strengthened 
through working to ensure that the Group’s corporate values and 
control culture are embedded throughout the organisation.
These efforts have resulted in a transparent analysis of the 
operational, financial and executive management controls for each of 
the risks that have been identified by management in its risk universe.
During 2016, the Audit Committee and Board formally reviewed 
the Principal Risks and Uncertainties of the Group prior to the 
publication of both the interim and full-year reports. 
Further details of the risk management system are set out  
on page 42.
Financial risk management
The Company’s objectives and policies on financial risk management 
including information on the Company’s exposures to market risk, 
such as foreign currency, commodity price, interest rate, inflation 
rate and equity price risks; credit risk and liquidity risk can be 
found in note 31 to the financial statements.
Internal control
The Group has in place internal controls and risk management 
systems in relation to the Group’s financial reporting process and 
the Group’s process for preparing consolidated accounts. These 
systems include policies and procedures to ensure that adequate 
accounting records are maintained and transactions are recorded 
accurately and fairly to permit the preparation of financial 
statements in accordance with IFRS.
During 2016, the Audit Committee has overseen the implementation 
of a new internal control monitoring document which is prepared 
and submitted to the Board on a quarterly basis. This document 
specifically reports on internal controls and the key findings from  
the quarterly internal audit reports. During the year, management 
embarked on a communication programme across the business to 
explain how the internal controls framework operates. This resulted 
in managers at each of the Business Units better understanding 
how the internal control programme operates.
The process agreed by the Audit Committee to monitor the 
Group’s system of internal controls focused on improving the 
understanding of how the various sources of assurance (such  
as operational management, financial management, executive 
management and internal audit) interact in the review and 
execution of material controls and identify and address any  
gaps in the control framework. T o this end, the Audit Committee, 
with the assistance of the risk function and management, has 
assessed its approach to monitoring the ongoing effectiveness  
of the Group’s system of internal controls. That review was 
concluded by the Audit Committee in February 2017. 
  Risk and Internal Control continued
Control exceptions identified in the current year include those 
relating to operational safety, compliance with regulations for 
handling hazardous materials and explosives, monitoring of 
electrical installations, installation of auxiliary services within  
the mine, monitoring and operation of tailings deposits and  
the oversight over contractors. These issues are not pervasive 
throughout the Group’s operations but each issue has occurred  
at least at one of the Group’s operating areas and plans for 
remediation have been approved and these are being progressed.
In the current year the Audit Committee has also received updates 
on the Group’s IT strategy and related risks. This has included initial 
consideration of an external cyber-security assessment which  
has highlighted a number of areas for future focus. Through an 
ongoing dialogue with the Executive Committee and operational 
management, these findings are being prioritised and remediation 
plans to address them, including control improvements, are being 
developed and implemented. 
The Audit Committee receives regular reports on ongoing 
management actions and initiatives undertaken to respond to 
control exceptions identified, recognising that, by their nature, these 
can take a period of time to take effect. The Committee reviews 
and closely monitors progress throughout the year. The Audit 
Committee is satisfied with the progress that it has seen in the year. 
In the prior year, certain opportunities to improve monitoring 
activities were identified, which have progressed in the year. The 
Audit Committee and the Board will continue to closely monitor 
the implementation and progress of these initiatives during 2017 . 
On the recommendation of the Audit Committee, the Board agreed 
that the following statement to be made about the review of the 
system of internal control in the 2016 Annual Report and Accounts.
The Board has, through the Executive Committee and the 
Audit Committee (at its February 2017 meeting), reviewed 
the effectiveness of the Group’s system of internal controls. 
As a result of this review, the Board considers that the 
measures that have been or are planned to be implemented 
complement Fresnillo’s risk management framework and  
are appropriate to the Group’s circumstances.
The Board is committed to the continued development  
of its internal control regime with a view to achieving and 
maintaining best practice levels of risk management and 
internal control for international mining companies listed  
on the London Stock Exchange.
Going concern
The Directors must satisfy themselves as to the Group’s ability  
to continue as a going concern for a minimum of 12 months from 
the approval of the financial statements. The Audit Committee 
supported the Board in this assessment by considering whether,  
in adverse circumstances, the Company has adequate liquid 
resources to meet its obligations as they fall due. In February 2017, 
the Audit Committee reviewed the Group budget and cash flow 
forecasts for the period to December 2018, taking into account the 
Company’s anticipated production profiles at each mine, budgeted 
capital and exploration expenditure and the sensitivity of the 
cashflow forecasts to movements in metal prices.  135
Fresnillo plc Annual Report 2016
FRESNILLO TODAY STRATEGIC REPORT CORPORATE GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
 Internal Audit
The Audit Committee has continued its regular dialogue with internal audit during the year:
Frequency Activity
Annually • Review Internal Audit Plan and its resourcing for the following year.
• Evaluation of internal audit.
Twice a year • Meeting between the Audit Committee and internal audit without management present.
Every meeting • Review of significant internal audit findings (including progress with red flags) based on the 
audits conducted during the most recent quarter.
The Head of Internal Audit attends all meetings of the Audit Committee. The Chairman of the Audit Committee met separately with the 
Head of Internal Audit and Internal Audit Manager six times during 2016.
The internal audit team seek to complete audits of all the operating 
risks across all of the Fresnillo Group’s mining assets on a regular 
basis. During the year, the Audit Committee have worked with 
internal audit to focus on three particular areas:
1. New mines: Following the emphasis on auditing the Company’s 
new mines which was initiated in 2015, internal audit continued 
to examine that proper procedures are implemented from the 
beginning in those new operations. This review particularly 
focused on the effectiveness of the processes adopted when 
building and commissioning the San Julián mine.
2. Red flags: At each meeting during the year, the Audit 
Committee has focussed on the progress made by 
management in dealing with ‘red flag’ items raised during 
internal audit visits to ensure that the management responses 
to remediation are appropriate and timely. Significant progress 
has been made during the year to reduce the number of issues 
requiring long-term remedial work that remained outstanding 
at the end of 2015.
3. IT issues (including Cyber Security and Data Protection):  
During 2016, the Audit Committee has received presentations 
from the Head of IT setting out the Group IT Strategy for the 
year and demonstrating how this supports the overall Group 
Strategy. Within these presentations, the Audit Committee has 
considered the steps being taken by management to: (i) deal 
with cyber security threats, and (ii) ensure appropriate levels of 
procedural compliance with the requirements of Mexican data 
protection legislation. The Audit Committee understands the 
steps being taken by management to deal with these matters 
and is satisfied with the progress being made.
In addition, the Audit Committee has also monitored the  
quality of the dialogue between internal audit and the Executive 
Committee in reviewing internal audit findings and agreeing action 
plans with appropriate levels of operational buy-in to deal with the 
points raised. The Audit Committee met with the Chief Executive 
Officer and Chief Operating Officer during the year to review this 
and is satisfied with the progress achieved through this dialogue.
The members of the Audit Committee evaluate the performance 
of the Internal Audit team annually and in 2016 this process was 
facilitated by the Chairman of the Audit Committee who discussed 
the findings of that review with the Head of Internal Audit and 
Internal Audit Manager. When reviewing the Internal Audit Plan  
for the year, the Audit Committee also considered the personnel 
available within the Internal Audit team, their expertise and 
experience. In 2016, the Audit Committee particularly considered 
the specialisms within the internal audit team in key areas of risk 
such as IT and safety.
The Audit Committee also considered EY’s report on this 
assessment and on the reasonableness of assumptions therein, 
including their consistency with assumptions and estimates  
used elsewhere in the preparation of the financial statements.  
In particular, the Committee challenged management on the 
feasibility of the mitigating actions and the potential speed  
of their implementation. As a result of the procedures performed, 
the Audit Committee satisfied itself that the going concern  
basis of preparation is appropriate and the financial statements 
appropriately reflect the conclusions on going concern.
Longer-term viability
Having adopted a robust process for the preparation of the 
Viability Statement (which was described in the 2015 Audit 
Committee Report), the Audit Committee considered with 
management how the disclosures could be enhanced and further 
validated. This discussion concluded that the approach adopted  
in respect of the 2015 Annual Report should continue to be applied 
in 2016 but with further analysis around the actions that the Board 
could take (for example, contingency planning) in mitigating the 
impact of the types of scenarios set out in the Viability Statement.
The Board’s Going Concern Statement and longer-term Viability Statement are set out in the strategic report on pages 54 and 55. 136
Fresnillo plc Annual Report 2016
Audit Committee Report continued
Peñoles owns just under 75% of the issued share capital of the 
Company (see page 125) and therefore has and will continue to 
have a significant level of influence over the affairs and operations 
of Fresnillo. 
Being part of the same Group also provides an opportunity  
for synergistic benefits to be achieved operationally and 
administratively. The principal arrangements between the 
Company and related parties are: 
 Related Parties
First half, 2016 activity Second half, 2016 activity
• Review of related parties list and payments to key  
external advisors.
• Review of insurance programme (including the role of related 
parties in the insurance programme).
• Review of the related parties list.
• Review of Met-Mex treatment charge and refining charge rates 
for 2016.
The Shared Services 
Agreement
The Shared Services Agreement is an agreement between the Company and Peñoles under which 23 
categories of services are provided to the Company by Peñoles. The Shared Services Agreement was 
renewed for five years with effect from 31 December 2012. In order to ensure that Fresnillo is charged 
appropriately for services rendered by Peñoles under the Shared Services Agreement, management have 
regular meetings with Peñoles to discuss its performance against the Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) for 
each of the different categories of service where issues of non-compliance are addressed and remediation 
agreed. In addition, internal audit conduct reviews of approximately one third of the services provided each 
year to ensure that these services are provided in accordance with the agreed KPI’s. As a result, all services 
are reviewed by internal audit over a three-year cycle.
During 2017, the Audit Committee will begin the process for renewing the Shared Service Agreement.  
This is expected to follow a similar process to the one used in 2012 and include benchmarking exercises 
across all of the service categories to ensure that the scope and pricing for each service is appropriate.
The Met-Mex Agreement During the year, the Audit Committee considered the proposed charges in respect of the Met-Mex 
arrangements for 2016 comparing proposed prices to comparable prices charged by Met-Mex to 
independent customers and to those of other refineries taking account of ore composition and transport 
costs to ensure that they are reasonable. Based on the satisfactory outcome of that review, the Chairman 
of the Audit Committee recommended to the Board that the independent Directors approve the proposed 
charges for 2016 under the Met-Mex arrangements, which they did in October 2016.
Other agreements There are other dealings with related parties in the ordinary course of business (e.g. insurance brokerage) 
which, although not requiring approval by independent Directors, will from time-to-time be reviewed  
by the Audit Committee to ensure that the arrangements are on a reasonable arm’s-length basis. 
 Whistleblowing
A summary of all whistleblowing hotline cases and Honour 
Commission responses is presented at each Audit Committee 
meeting. 
The ‘Fresnillo Plays Fair’ whistleblower hotline allows stakeholders 
to anonymously report (via an independent third party) violations 
of the Group’s Code of Conduct. The results are assessed by an 
independent third party and processed for review by the Honour 
Commission, which is comprised of the Chief Executive Officer,  
the Chief Operating Officer, the Compliance Officer (currently  
the Chief Financial Officer), the Director of Internal Audit, the Vice 
President of Exploration and the Legal Manager. These 
arrangements have been established for some time and the  
Audit Committee is responsible for ensuring that appropriate 
investigation of all whistleblowing incidents is undertaken  
in a timely manner. 
During 2016, the Audit Committee was satisfied that all matters 
had been properly investigated with appropriate action taken.  
The Audit Committee considers that current level of issues raised 
is good evidence that the current programme is being taken 
seriously across the Group and is operating satisfactorily. 137
Fresnillo plc Annual Report 2016
FRESNILLO TODAY STRATEGIC REPORT CORPORATE GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
 The Effectiveness of the Audit Committee
In addition to the activities set out above, the Audit Committee takes various steps each year to ensure that the Committee itself and the 
key functions supporting its role, primarily the external auditor and internal audit continue to be effective. The key steps are:
Activity Outcome in 2016
• Review of the training and development requirements for Audit 
Committee members.
• Committee members attended external briefings and seminars 
to keep their knowledge up-to-date in addition to briefings from 
the external auditors relating to changes in financial regulation.
• Annual Review of the T erms of Reference of the Audit 
Committee in order to ensure that they remain up-to-date.
• The Company Secretary facilitated a review of the terms of 
reference of the Audit Committee and changes were agreed 
which aligned the terms of reference with new requirements  
on non-audit services.
The outcomes of the Audit Committee evaluation in 2016 is discussed below.
Prior to the planned external evaluation in 2017, the Audit Committee conducted an internal evaluation in 2016. This was facilitated by  
the Company Secretary, using a questionnaire-based approach. This was the final step in a three-year process which commenced in  
2014 when Independent Audit Limited undertook an externally-led evaluation of the Audit Committee. 
The broader context for the 2016 exercise, therefore, was:
Year Approach Outcome
2014 • Externally-facilitated evaluation. • The Audit Committee established five key workstreams 
in response to the 50 recommendations of  
the evaluation.
2015 • Internal Review of the Key Workstreams arising from 
the 2014 evaluation.
• Progress on the workstreams was monitored and 
reported on in the 2015 Audit Committee Report.
2016 • Internal questionnaire to key Audit Committee 
stakeholders evaluating progress on all of the original 
recommendations made by Independent Audit Limited.
• The key conclusions of this exercise are  
summarised below.
The conclusions of the 2016 evaluation were that the Audit 
Committee is satisfied that its core duties in relation to financial 
reporting, external audit, risk and internal control, internal audit, 
whistleblowing and related parties are being performed well,  
albeit that it recognises the necessity of continuous improvement. 
The Audit Committee intends, however, to consider the following 
aspects of its activities following its own evaluation exercise and 
the Board evaluation review:
• Review of the Board’s post-investment review procedures.
• Oversight of management’s evaluation of the Shared Services 
Agreement as it approaches its renewal date.
• Oversight of the IT Governance Committee in relation to  
the management of the IT strategy and IT-related internal 
controls and the liaison with internal audit.
• The interface between the Audit Committee, internal audit  
and the HSECR Committee in relation to internal audit findings 
relating to health, safety and environmental matters.
• The relationship between the Audit Committee’s oversight  
of the Honour Commission and the wider governance of  
culture by the Board and the HSECR Committee.
The Corporate Governance Report has been approved by the Board of Directors of Fresnillo plc.

Directors’ Remuneration Report
Chairman’s Annual Statement
The fundamentals of our 
remuneration policy remain 
sound and appropriate for 
Fresnillo and are supported 
by our shareholders. 
Charles Jacobs
Chairman of the Remuneration Committee
Dear Shareholder,
As Chairman of the Remuneration Committee, I am pleased to 
present our Remuneration Report for the year ended 31 December 
2016 and, within this introduction, set the context for the activities 
and decisions of the Remuneration Committee during the year. 
Whilst much of the activity of the Remuneration Committee  
during 2016 may be regarded as ‘business as usual’, the expiry  
of our current Directors’ remuneration policy at the 2017 AGM  
has presented a timely opportunity for us to reflect on our overall 
approach to remuneration. The firm conclusion from that review  
is that the fundamentals of our remuneration policy remain  
sound and appropriate for Fresnillo and are supported by our 
shareholders. Therefore, whilst we are proposing some changes 
(as outlined on page 140) the essential structure of the policy  
will remain unchanged and therefore the key features of the  
policy remain as follows: 
Component of remuneration Key features and rationale
Base salary  
and benefits
These are core elements of remuneration 
designed to recruit and retain Directors. 
Ordinarily, the same basis for change 
(e.g. salary increases) will be applied 
across the Company to senior 
management and employees alike. 
Annual bonus Annual bonus is capped at six months’ 
salary and is paid on the basis of metrics 
set out in the remuneration policy.
Long-term  
incentive schemes
There are no long-term incentive 
schemes. The annual bonus scheme sets 
targets which are aligned to the long-term 
strategic objectives so that these priorities 
are embedded within the day-to-day 
activities of our business rather than 
being seen as something extra.
Shareholding 
guidelines
In the absence of share-based incentive 
schemes, there is no need to adopt 
shareholding guidelines for executives.
Claw-back  
and malus
The absence of long-term incentives 
makes it difficult to adopt claw-back  
and malus arrangements. There is  
scope within the bonus scheme  
for bonus awards to be adjusted 
downward at the discretion of the 
Remuneration Committee.
As in previous years, we have published remuneration information 
in respect of our Chief Executive Officer as if he were a member of 
the Board, even though that is not currently the case. We believe 
this is within the spirit of our reporting obligations, even if it is not 
strictly required, as it adds to the transparency of our reporting. 139
Fresnillo plc Annual Report 2016
FRESNILLO TODAY STRATEGIC REPORT CORPORATE GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Remuneration Committee membership
Although the UK Corporate Governance Code emphasises  
the need for the Remuneration Committee to be made up  
of independent Non-executive Directors, we believe that it  
is vital that the membership of the Committee is made up of 
Non-executive Directors who are able to bring the following 
perspectives to the working of the Remuneration Committee:
• An understanding of shareholder expectations. 
• An understanding of the evolving remuneration expectations  
of investors on the London Stock Exchange.
• An understanding of the general approaches to remuneration 
within the Mexican market.
When viewed against these three criteria, the current composition 
of the Remuneration Committee, being myself, Mr Baillères, the 
Chairman of the Board, and Mr Fernando Ruiz, appears to be very 
appropriate. Thus, although Mr Baillères was non-independent  
at the time of his appointment to the Board (and therefore his 
membership of the Remuneration Committee does not comply 
with Code Provision D.2.1 of the UK Corporate Governance  
Code), the Board continues to uphold the view that Mr Baillères’ 
experience and knowledge of the Group and the Mexican  
market and his considerable contribution to the Remuneration 
Committee’s deliberations justifies his membership of the 
Remuneration Committee. I am based in London and aware of the 
UK requirements whilst Mr Ruiz is based in Mexico and, along with 
the Chairman, is aware of the Mexican approach to remuneration.
Remuneration Committee activity
During the year, the Committee met four times. Its key activities 
during the year were:
• Monitoring of UK regulatory requirements and changing 
shareholder expectations and a review of potential changes  
to the remuneration policy. 
• Receipt of reports from Willis T owers Watson concerning the 
benchmarking of remuneration for members of the Executive 
Committee and Executive Directors, by reference to the  
peer group.
• Consideration of information about Mexican inflation trends  
and internal employee salary reviews prior to setting the annual 
salary increases for the Chief Executive Officer and members  
of the Executive Committee.
• Review of the performance of the Chief Executive Officer and 
members of the Executive Committee compared to the KPIs 
set for 2015 and approval of annual bonus awards for 2015 
based on achievement of KPI targets.
• Review of KPI targets for the Chief Executive Officer and 
members of the Executive Committee for 2016, including 
consideration of the effectiveness of changes to the targets  
to reward better performance in safety improvement and 
exploration efforts set the previous year.
• Other activities, e.g. Committee evaluation, as required  
by the Committee’s terms of reference.
I am always happy to talk to our shareholders about our approach 
to remuneration particularly as we approach the renewal of our 
policy at our 2017 Annual General Meeting. 
Y ours faithfully

A new Directors’ remuneration policy will be proposed to shareholders for approval at the 2017 Annual General Meeting on 23 May 2017. 
The full policy is set out on pages 142 to 146. For ease of reference, the significant changes being proposed are summarised as follows:
Proposed change Rationale
The addition of limited discretion in the Bonus section of 
Remuneration Policy table to enable the Committee to  
adjust individual KPI weightings from year-to-year.
This provides the Remuneration Committee with limited flexibility 
to adjust the weighting of different elements of the bonus KPIs to 
ensure that the bonus remains aligned to the strategic objectives 
as they evolve. 
Change to triennial benchmarking (rather than biennial), to be 
reviewed in the year prior to the renewal of the remuneration 
policy.
Institutional shareholders have stated that they prefer three-yearly 
cycles for benchmarking (which are administratively easier  
to manage).
Addition of a cap on the maximum level of salary increase for the 
Chief Executive Officer in any year to ensure that it is not more 
than 10% higher than the average percentage pay increase for  
the workforce as a whole, except in exceptional circumstances 
which would be fully explained in the following Annual Report  
on Remuneration.
T o ensure that there is absolute clarity about the maximum level  
of pay increase for the Chief Executive Officer by reference to the 
workforce whilst allowing some scope for justifiable above-inflation 
increase e.g. where the Chief Executive Officer has been initially 
appointed at a below median pay level to allow scope to grow  
into the role.
More explicit disclosure about the peer group used to benchmark 
the Chief Executive Officer’s remuneration to ensure that it remains 
within the parameters set out in the remuneration policy. 
T o provide clarity about the most appropriate group of companies 
to use for benchmarking purposes in response to comparator 
groups selected by third parties. 
Addition of a provision to allow the Remuneration Committee to 
adjust a bonus outcome downward if the financial or operational 
performance of the Company or individual does not justify the 
bonus level that would otherwise have been achieved on an 
ordinary interpretation of the targets and metrics.
This specific discretion to reduce bonus payments where 
circumstances justify it is effectively a ‘malus’ provision.
The Remuneration Committee has previously agreed a change  
to the payment bandings by adding a three-month bonus  
payment band. 
T o bring the banding structure for the Chief Executive Officer’s 
bonus arrangements into line with the changes previously agreed 
for the other Executive Committee members and provide more 
flexibility in bonus payments.
Addition of a new section describing how shareholder views  
on remuneration are taken into account.
As required by the Regulations.
A statement concerning the use of Shareholding Guidelines  
is introduced.
This had previously been included in the Annual Report on 
Remuneration and is now part of the remuneration policy. 141

Directors Remuneration Policy in summary
The retention of key senior executives and the alignment of management incentives with the creation of shareholder value are key 
objectives of the Group’s current remuneration policy.
Setting base salary levels for Executive Directors or key management at an appropriate level is key to managerial retention in Mexico. 
Salaries are therefore market competitive both within the Mexican context and internationally for comparable companies. T otal 
remuneration is benchmarked triennially against the Company’s peer group within Mexico and internationally to ensure that the whole 
remuneration package is maintained at this level over the long-term. Salaries are positioned within the range according to experience  
and length of service.
The annual bonus rewards the achievement of financial and strategic business targets and the delivery of personal objectives. Although 
the annual bonus is set for and based on performance over a single-year period, the KPI’s and targets are also designed to ensure  
that both short-term objectives and the long-term development of the Fresnillo Group are given broadly equal priority within variable 
remuneration. As a consequence, the Company does not use share-based forms of remuneration to incentivise long-term performance. 
The Annual Bonus Plan aligns incentives to the short-term (one year) and long-term (multiple year) objectives in the following manner.
Time horizon for objectives
Strategic objective 
Key performance indicator  
for the bonus scheme Short-term Long-term Measure Weighting

Notes:
1. The Remuneration Committee may approve changes to the weightings in order to ensure that the bonus remains aligned to the strategic objectives as they evolve.
2. The 2016 net profit amount for the purposes of the 2016 annual bonus was re-based to take account of the year-on-year changes in currency, metals prices, the revaluation  
of the Silverstream contract.

Directors’ Remuneration Policy
Introduction
This part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report sets out the remuneration policy of the Company and has been prepared in accordance 
with The Large and Medium-sized Companies and Groups (Accounts and Reports) (Amendment) Regulations 2013 (‘the Regulations’). 
The policy has been developed taking into account the principles of the UK Corporate Governance Code 2016 and the views of our major 
shareholders. It describes the policy to be applied for the financial year ending 31 December 2017 and beyond. The remuneration policy 
will be put to a binding vote at the 2017 Annual General Meeting, and, subject to it receiving majority shareholder support, the Effective 
Date of the policy will be the date of the 2017 Annual General Meeting of the Company, 23 May 2017. This policy replaces in its entirety  
the remuneration policy approved by the Company’s shareholders on 16 May 2014 but the Company may honour any commitment  
to pay an amount which was made before this policy came into effect or before the Director became a Director.
As required by UK law, the remuneration policy is binding in relation to Directors. The Company currently has no Executive Directors  
who would be bound by the remuneration policy. However, the Company will (as it has previously done) treat the Chief Executive Officer 
as if he were an Executive Director for the purposes of the remuneration policy and for reporting on his remuneration.
Remuneration policy
The Group’s remuneration policy seeks to ensure that the Company is able to attract, retain and motivate its Executive Directors and 
members of the Executive Committee. The retention of key management and the alignment of management incentives and the creation 
of shareholder value being key objectives of this policy.
Setting base salaries for Executive Directors and members of the Executive Committee at an appropriate level is a key to managerial 
retention in Mexico. Therefore, the Remuneration Committee seeks to ensure that salaries are market competitive both within the Mexican 
context and internationally for comparable companies. T otal compensation is set within a range around the median level for the Company’s 
peer group within Mexico and internationally, total remuneration is benchmarked triennially to ensure that the whole remuneration package 
is maintained at this level over the long-term. Salaries are positioned within the range according to experience and service.
The table below sets out the key elements of Executive Directors’ pay set out in the remuneration policy (the ‘Policy T able’):
Base salary
Provides the core reward for the role
Operation Reviewed annually and fixed for 12 months starting on 1 April each year and the review is influenced by:
• Role, experience and performance.
• Average workforce salary adjustments.
• Mexican economic factors.
• Comparison with the Company’s peer group in Mexico and internationally.
Salaries are benchmarked triennially by reference to companies of similar size and complexity and will  
be positioned within a mid-range of the Company’s comparator peer group in Mexico and internationally.  
The next review will take place in April 2017 (under the old policy) and April 2019 (under the new policy).
Maximum value The Executive Director’s salary will be reviewed taking account of the benchmarking information received by  
the Remuneration Committee and the maximum value of the Executive Director’s base salary will be positioned 
within the mid-range for companies in the peer group of Mexican and international resources companies.  
An Executive Director’s salary will be increased in line with increases applied across the whole workforce.  
In exceptional circumstances, the Executive Director’s salary may be increased by up to but never more than  
10% above the average pay increase for the whole workforce of the Company in any year. The rationale for  
such increases will be fully explained in the Annual Report on Remuneration.
Performance metric The Remuneration Committee considers individual salaries at the appropriate meeting each year by reference to 
the factors noted under the ‘Operation’ heading in this table. Details of the current remuneration of the Executive 
Director are provided in the Annual Report on Remuneration.
Discretion The Remuneration Committee will establish the Company’s comparator peer group in Mexico and internationally as 
part of the triennial review which it will consider in April 2019. The peer group will be reviewed again in April 2019. 
The Committee will report on the outcome of these reviews within the relevant Annual Report on Remuneration.
Benefits
Help recruit and retain employees
Operation An Executive Director would be entitled to life insurance, the use of a company car, the payment of premiums  
for medical insurance covering limited expenses and check-ups. Benefits may be changed if Company policy  
on benefits changes.
Maximum value The current benefits are set out in the Annual Remuneration Report. The maximum value of benefits will be 
determined by Company policy that is applicable to all employees.
Performance metric None.
Discretion The Remuneration Committee may consider changes to the benefits made available to Executive Directors  
in line with any changes in the policy for benefits provided to all employees.

Fresnillo plc Annual Report 2016
FRESNILLO TODAY STRATEGIC REPORT CORPORATE GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Pension
Rewards continued employment and sustained contribution
Operation The Group operates a defined contribution scheme. Executive Directors are entitled to membership of the 
defined contribution scheme.
Maximum value The maximum company contribution for any employee may not exceed 13% of salary.
Performance metric None.
Discretion Not applicable.
Annual bonus
Rewards the achievement of both short- and long-term financial and strategic business targets and delivery of personal objectives
Operation T argets are renewed annually and relate to the strategic aims of the business as a whole. A scoring system is used 
for the plan. Each objective set for the executive at the beginning of the year is allocated a points-rating which 
represents a median performance target for that objective. Upper and lower point thresholds are set to allow for 
outstanding performance and to ensure that underperformance is not rewarded. For each member of the Executive 
Committee (including the Chief Executive Officer, the Chief Financial Officer, the Vice President of Exploration and 
the Chief Operating Officer), a bonus is only payable if the aggregate performance equals or exceeds 100 points. 
Bonus payments are paid for aggregate performance against target at or above 100 points as follows:
Points Variable pay (month’s salary) Variable pay (% of salary)
Less than 100 Zero Zero
100.00–103.75 Two 16.67
103.76-107.50 Three 25.00
107.51–111.00 Four 33.33
111.01–115.00 Five 41.67
115.01+ Six 50.00
Maximum value The maximum percentage of salary is 50% (six months’ salary) and is paid where Executive Directors achieve 
115.01 points or more under the Annual Bonus Plan (target is 100 points).
Performance metric The KPI targets focus set out in the previous table will apply and are intended to focus on risks that are within  
the control and influence of management. Thus, the management of safety, security, project, human resource, 
exploration and environmental risks are all currently implicitly covered within the KPIs. The KPIs and targets, 
which are set by reference to the reserved and resources and financial metrics at the previous year end and/or 
set in the budget for the forthcoming financial year are also designed to ensure that both short-term objectives 
and the long-term development of the Fresnillo Group are given equal priority.
Details of the measures, targets and performance which is tested on an annual basis will be provided in the 
Annual Report on Remuneration.
Discretion The Remuneration Committee considers that the KPIs, upon which bonuses are based, may need to evolve  
from year-to-year in line with the strategy and therefore it retains the discretion to make modest adjustments  
to the KPIs themselves, the bonus bands within the overall maximum and the individual KPI weightings from 
year-to-year.
The Remuneration Committee retains the discretion to adjust bonus payments in the following circumstances:
(i)   A downward adjustment where the KPI outcomes would result, in the opinion of the Remuneration 
Committee, in a bonus payment which cannot be justified by the Company’s financial or operational 
performance during the year (or subsequently in respect of previous years). In this case a downward 
adjustment would be applied.
(ii)   Where factors outside the control of Executive Directors e.g. force majeure circumstances have significantly 
depressed the level of points awarded. In deciding whether adjustment is merited, the Remuneration 
Committee will consider the appropriateness of the Executive Director’s response to those circumstances;  
in this situation a modest upward adjustment may be considered.
(iii)  Poor executive response to adverse health, safety or environmental performance during the year, in which 
case a downward adjustment would be considered.
The use of any such discretions will be fully explained in future Directors’ Remuneration Reports.
Note: Any adjustment in individual KPI weightings will not result in their achievement being any less difficult to satisfy. 144
Fresnillo plc Annual Report 2016
Alignment of executive remuneration and the market
In setting the fixed remuneration of Executive Directors and the 
members of the Executive Committee, information relating to the 
mining company comparators is provided by various consultants. 
Information relating to the Mexican economic metrics and internal 
benchmarking is collated by management for the Remuneration 
Committee to consider. 
Reviews are conducted by Willis T owers Watson triennially.  
These enable the Remuneration Committee to validate the 
Company’s policy towards remuneration and ensure that it was 
globally as well as locally competitive. The analysis evaluates the 
elements of base salary, short-term compensation (guaranteed 
payments and short-term bonus) and long-term compensation 
(primarily stock programmes) separately. With assistance  
from Willis T owers Watson, the Remuneration Committee has 
established a peer group consisting of the following companies 
which will be used to benchmark any Executive Director’s and  
any Executive Committee member’s remuneration to ensure  
that it remains within the parameters set out in this policy.
Europe Randgold Resources
Acacia Mining
Hochschild Mining
USA/Canada Agnico Eagle Mines Ltd
Goldcorp Inc.
Hecla Mining Co.
Newmont Mining Corporation
Panamerican Silver Corp.
Yamana Gold Inc.
Mexico Goldcorp 
Grupo Mexico
Comparison of executive and wider Company remuneration 
When setting pay and benefits for Executive Directors and 
members of the Executive Committee, the Remuneration 
Committee takes account of pay and conditions across the Group. 
It will consider the overall pay increase percentage negotiated  
with employee representatives as its starting point. Subject to the 
10% limit in the Policy T able, the Remuneration Committee may 
agree pay increases above or below the agreed percentage in 
exceptional circumstances, where in its discretion it considers  
such variance to the norm to be justified. Other than the  
Willis T owers Watson report specifically commissioned by the 
Remuneration Committee, the same benchmark reports are  
used in the evaluation of executive and employee remuneration, 
thus providing a common approach to both. 
Below Board level, a statutory profit-sharing arrangement (‘PTU’) 
is operated which in some years has enabled employees to receive 
significant levels of bonus in line with the increased profitability  
of the relevant employing company. Neither the Chief Executive 
Officer nor any of the Non-executive Directors participate in a PTU 
scheme within the Fresnillo Group. The other members of senior 
management group below Board level are employed by Servicios 
Administrativos Fresnillo SA de CV which pays annual PTU 
payments. However such payments are modest.
The Group operates two pension schemes: (i) a defined benefit 
scheme which was closed to new members on 1 July 2007  
with benefits frozen at this date for existing members, subject  
to indexation with reference to the Mexican National Consumer  
Price Index; and (ii) a defined contribution scheme (which was 
introduced on 1 July 2007). Membership of the latter scheme is 
voluntary, members earning a salary of no more than 25 times the 
minimum wage in force from time to time may make contributions 
of 5% to the scheme. 
On behalf of members earning a salary of no more than 25  
times the minimum wage in force from time to time the employing 
company may make contributions of 5% to the scheme. The 
employing company may also make additional contributions 
between 5% and 8% of salary to this plan. Members may elect  
to match percentages between 5% to 8% of salary.
Executive Directors may participate the Group’s pension schemes 
on the same basis as any other employee.
Engagement with shareholders on remuneration
The composition of the Remuneration Committee has been 
designed to ensure that the views of the controlling shareholder 
(through the membership of the Chairman of the Board on the 
Committee) and the independent shareholders (through the 
membership of a UK-based Director on the Committee) can  
be represented. The Remuneration Committee has considered  
the views of organisations such as Institutional Shareholder 
Services (‘ISS’) and the Investment Association both generally  
and as reported to the Company in relation to its own executive 
remuneration practices prior to each Annual General Meeting, 
when considering the Remuneration Policy and its application.  
The Chairman of the Remuneration Committee also discussed 
aspects of the Remuneration Policy in person with ISS, and there 
were no major concerns raised.
The Remuneration Committee does not consult with employees  
in setting Directors’ remuneration.
Policy on recruitment
The Remuneration Committee will consider the remuneration  
of new Executive Directors by reference to the remuneration policy 
set out above. The Remuneration Committee does not as a default 
position pay sign-on payments or compensate new Directors for 
any variable remuneration forfeited from any employment prior to 
joining the Board. If it did, such payments would be fully explained 
in the next Annual Report on Remuneration both as to the reason 
for payment and the rationale for the quantum. Salary will be set 
so as to be market competitive both within the Mexican context 
and internationally for comparable companies and taking account 
of the experience and seniority of the appointee coming into the 
new role. The Remuneration Committee is likely to set base salaries 
below median on appointment whilst retaining discretion to  
award increases during the first and, possibly, subsequent years  
to bring salaries into the normal range expected for Executive 
Directors, in line with the Company’s stated policy. Such increases 
will not exceed the maximum level set out in the Policy T able. New 
Executive Directors will receive benefits and pensions in line with 
Company’s existing policy and will be able to participate in the 
Annual Bonus Plan on a pro-rated basis for the portion of the 
financial year for which they are in post. The maximum level of 
variable pay for new recruits will be the same as that set out in  
the Policy T able for existing employees (pro-rated as necessary).
Policy on loss of office
Other than in circumstances of gross misconduct, Executive 
Directors and members of the Executive Committee, including  
the Chief Executive Officer, leaving employment from the Group, 
will be entitled to receive salary and pro-rated annual bonus based 
on performance to the date of leaving. Statutory entitlements  
are payable according to Mexican labour law, based on length  
of service. Mexican labour law does not make any provision for 
employers and employees to give or receive notice of termination 
of employment. Therefore the Committee will not make payments 
in lieu of notice to departing executives unless required to do so  
by law. No contractual commitments concerning loss of office 
were entered into with any Director prior to 27 June 2012.

Fresnillo plc Annual Report 2016
FRESNILLO TODAY STRATEGIC REPORT CORPORATE GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Annual bonus plan and policy on variable remuneration
It is the Company’s policy not to use its equity to incentivise 
long-term performance. The Company’s core strategy is one  
of long-term sustainable growth. Sustainable growth in mining 
requires the steady and safe expansion of the Group’s operations 
through the discovery of new resources and construction, 
maintenance and/or expansion of new mines. No distinction  
is therefore made between short- and long-term incentives. 
The Company operates a single cash-based incentive plan for 
Executive Directors and the members of the Executive Committee, 
including the Chief Executive Officer. 
Malus and claw-back
The Remuneration Committee has considered whether malus and/
or claw-back provisions should be incorporated into the service 
agreement for the Chief Executive Officer . Given that the Company 
does not operate any remuneration plans with a timeframe of more 
than one year, the Remuneration Committee does not consider 
that there is much value in introducing claw-back provisions into 
the contractual arrangements with the Chief Executive Officer  
at this stage. Within this remuneration policy, the Remuneration 
Committee reserves the right to make downward adjustment  
to bonus payments where the KPI outcomes would result, in the 
opinion of the Remuneration Committee, in a bonus payment 
which cannot be justified by the Company’s financial or personal 
performance during the year (or subsequently in respect of 
previous years). In this case a downward adjustment would  
be applied.
Illustrations of the application of the remuneration policy  
for the Chief Executive Officer
The following table sets out the fixed and variable remuneration  
of the Chief Executive Officer in the different scenarios where  
he receives, minimum, target and maximum variable pay (based  
on 31 December 2016 remuneration).
External appointments
It is the Board’s policy to allow Executive Directors to accept 
directorships of other quoted and non-quoted companies and 
retain any fees or other remuneration for doing so, provided that 
they have obtained the consent of the Chairman of the Company. 
Any such directorships must be formally notified to the Board.
Chairman and Non-executive Directors
The remuneration of the Chairman of the Company and the 
Non-executive Directors consists of fees that are paid quarterly  
in arrears. The Chairman and Non-executive Directors do not 
participate in any long-term incentive or annual bonus schemes, 
nor do they accrue any pension entitlement. Neither the Chairman 
nor any of the Non-executive Directors has a service contract  
with the Company; however each has entered into a letter  
of appointment with the Company.
Non-executive Directors’ letters of appointment
On their initial appointment, each of the Non-executive Directors 
signed a letter of appointment with the Company, for an initial 
period of three years. Since April 2011, the letters of appointment of 
serving Non-executive Directors have been drafted in accordance 
with provision B.7.1 of the UK Corporate Governance Code, thus 
obliging them to retire at each Annual General Meeting and be 
subject to annual re-election by shareholders to serve for a  
further term of one year. The amendments have been drafted  
such that renewed appointment will not necessitate a new letter  
of appointment. 
The Chairman of the Company does not receive any fees for acting 
as Chairman other than his fees as a Non-executive Director.
Each Non-executive Director is expected to commit a minimum  
of 14 days per year in fulfilling their duties as a Director of the 
Company. Once this policy is approved a base fee of £35,000  
per annum will be paid to each non-UK-based Non-executive 
Director to reflect the time commitment and level of involvement 
they are required to make in the activities of the Board as a whole. 
There are no set fees for membership of any Board committees  
or for the chairmanship of the Board. The UK-based Non-executive 
Directors receive a higher fee to reflect the additional time 
commitment that they make in order to travel to Board meetings  
in Mexico and to their responsibilities as appropriate as Senior 
Independent Director, Chairman of the Remuneration Committee 
and Chairman of the Audit Committee.
Unless otherwise determined, the Director concerned may  
give not less than three months’ notice of termination of the 
appointment. Copies of the Directors’ letters of appointment  
and service agreements are available for inspection at the 
Company’s registered office.

1. Unexpired term: the Non-executive Directors all have rolling contracts which are subject to the annual re-election at the Annual General Meeting. The current term expires  
on 23 May 2016, being the date of the next Annual General Meeting but the appointment will continue after that date provided that each Director is re-elected at the AGM.
2. The fees payable to the Non-UK Non-executive Directors will, subject to this policy being approved, be increased to £35,000 with effect from the 23 May 2017.
The Board have agreed that the aggregate fees of the Non-executive Directors (excluding the reimbursement of expenses) will be 
£530,000 per annum. The Articles of Association of the Company require that the aggregate remuneration of Directors may not exceed 
£3,000,000 unless approved by an ordinary resolution of the shareholders of the Company. This is the maximum figure for the purposes 
of this policy.
Shareholding guidelines
Fresnillo has not introduced share ownership guidelines The Company does not operate a share-based incentive scheme given that the 
culture for incentives in the Mexican market does not favour share-based incentives. Consequently, there would be neither opportunity 
nor appetite for executives to build a shareholding in the Company and therefore the Remuneration Committee has not adopted any 
shareholding guidelines. 147

2. Any decrease in equivalent ounces produced and/or in reserves and resources will result in points being deducted from the total points scored.
3. Net profit is adjusted to exclude currency fluctuation, the effect of year-on-year changes in metals prices and any revaluation of the Silverstream contract. The 2016 net profit 
amount for the purposes of the 2016 annual bonus was in line with this approach. A table setting out the reconciliation of Net Profit to the numbers reporting in the financial 
statements is set out below.
4. The points awarded for the Stakeholder and T eamwork objectives are subject to some discretion. The following points are awarded depending on the Remuneration Committee’s 
assessment of the stakeholder and teamwork effort: Satisfactory performance = 100% of weighting points; outstanding performance = 140% of weighting points; and 
underperformance = 0 points.
5. In the event of a single fatality, zero points will be awarded for safety. For the purposes of calculating fatalities; all fatalities are included, irrespective of whether they are employees 
or contractors. Conversely, in the event of zero fatalities during the year, the number of points awarded would be increased to ten points.
6. In addition, to the penalty for a single fatality (see note 5), the number of points awarded will be further reduced by 1% if there are two fatalities, or by 2% if there are three fatalities, 
or by 3% if there are four fatalities etc.

Implementation of Remuneration Policy in 2016
Chief Executive Officer salary and benefits
The T otal Remuneration paid to the Chief Executive Officer, Octavio Alvídrez, during the year was US$1,110,765.
During the year, Mr Alvídrez served as Chief Executive Officer but was not a member of the Board. Mr Alvídrez is employed under  
a contract of employment with Servicios Administrativos Fresnillo S.A. de C. V ., a subsidiary of Fresnillo plc. Mr Alvídrez’ contract was 
entered into on 15 August 2012 and is governed by Mexican Federal Labour Law. Mr Alvídrez’ service agreement does not have a  
fixed term and can be terminated in writing by either party with no entitlement to additional compensation for termination other than 
compensation payments required for termination without cause under Mexican labour laws. No benefits are payable on termination.
The salary payable under Mr Alvídrez’ service agreement is MX$898,700 per month, which excludes payments for holidays, Company-
paid savings contributions and other cash benefits. In 2016, his total salary payments were MX$14,780,860 (US$792,255). In 2015, his  
total salary payments were MX$14,078,946 (US$887,953). Mr Alvídrez was awarded a salary increase of 4.5% to reflect his development 
as Chief Executive Officer over the past year. Willis T owers Watson have confirmed that the salary review was in line with the  
remuneration policy.
Under his service agreement, Mr Alvídrez is entitled to 26 working days’ paid holiday per year. He is not entitled to profit-sharing (PTU). 
Mr Alvídrez is also entitled to life insurance, the use of a chauffeur and company car, the payment of medical insurance premiums covering 
limited expenses and check-ups, meals and subsistence payments and club subscriptions.
The Remuneration Committee consider that year-on-year changes to the remuneration of the Chief Executive Officer align equitably with 
changes in the remuneration of the Company’s workforce for the following reasons:
Salary The Remuneration Committee ordinarily use the same percentage agreed for the whole workforce as the 
percentage basis for the annual salary increase for the Chief Executive Officer.
Bonus The Chief Executive is prohibited from participating in the PTU Scheme and therefore may only receive  
a maximum of six months’ pay. All other employees are eligible for PTU payments annually which can  
be as high as 200% of salary in exceptional years.
Benefits The Chief Executive Officer participates in the Company-wide benefits scheme.
Pension The Chief Executive Officer is a member of the Company’s standard pension scheme.
Annual bonus
Mr Alvídrez achieved 109.5 points under the bonus scheme for the year ended 31 December 2016 (2015: 104.1 points) and therefore was 
awarded a bonus of MX$3,594,800; (US$192,681); for 2016. 
Pensions
The Group operates two pension schemes: a defined benefit scheme and a defined contribution scheme (which was introduced on 1 July 
2007). Further information on the Group’s pension schemes is set out in the remuneration policy on page 144.
Malus and claw-back
The introduction of the 2016 Corporate Governance Code requires companies to either introduce malus and/or claw-back provisions  
and other forms of deferred variable pay where appropriate, or explain why they have not complied with the Code. In 2016, the Company 
had not introduced any malus or claw-back provisions into the contractual agreements with the Chief Executive Officer; however the 2017 
remuneration policy will give the Remuneration Committee discretion to reduce bonus payments to take account of poor operational  
or financial performance in previous years, see page 145 in the Directors’ remuneration policy section.

Implementation of the remuneration policy in 2016 and 2017
In 2014, the Remuneration Committee asked Willis T owers Watson to recommend a framework for setting the salaries of Executive 
Directors and members of the Executive Committee. Following this review, the Remuneration Committee established the peer group  
of companies for the purposes of validating the remuneration of Executive Directors (the ‘Peer Group’). The Peer Group consists of 11 
resources companies from Europe (three companies), USA and Canada (six companies) and Mexico (two companies) (see page 144).  
The Remuneration Committee has agreed that the Chief Executive’s salary should be set within a range of 25% to 75% of the Peer Group 
for base salary. In 2016, Willis T owers Watson advised the Remuneration Committee that the CEO’s salary was well within the parameters 
set out in the remuneration policy.
The new 2017 remuneration policy as set out on pages 142 to 146 of this Report will be presented to shareholders for approval at the 
Company’s 2017 Annual General Meeting.
The Remuneration Committee has considered the effectiveness of KPIs and targets that were set for 2016 and it continues to consider 
that the overall structure of the Incentive Plan and the targets set in 2016 remain appropriate for 2017 other than where adjusted to  
reflect the 2017 business plan targets. The 2017 weightings and measures are therefore set out in the table below. The 2017 targets  
and performance against those targets will be disclosed in this report.

Fresnillo plc Annual Report 2016
Remuneration Committee
Membership
The Remuneration Committee consisted of the following Directors 
in the year ended 31 December 2016: 
• Mr Charles Jacobs (Chairman), Independent  
Non-executive Director 
• Mr Alberto Baillères, Chairman of the Board
• Mr Fernando Ruiz, Independent Non-executive Director
Mr Baillères was non-independent at the time of his appointment 
to the Board and therefore his membership of the Remuneration 
Committee does not comply with Code Provision D.2.1 of the  
UK Corporate Governance Code. However, the Board believes  
that Mr Baillères’ experience and knowledge of the Group and  
the Mexican market and his considerable contribution to the 
Remuneration Committee’s deliberations justifies his membership 
of the Remuneration Committee. Further information about  
the rationale for the current membership of the Remuneration 
Committee is set out in the Chairman’s Annual Statement  
on pages 138 and 139.
Role
The Remuneration Committee has responsibility for making 
recommendations to the Board on the Group’s remuneration 
policy for senior management (the Chief Executive Officer and 
other members of the Executive Committee), and for determining 
specific remuneration packages for senior management, including 
pension rights and any compensation packages, as well as 
remuneration of the Chairman within agreed terms of reference.
The Remuneration Committee, is responsible for setting the 
Chairman’s remuneration; however the Chairman does not receive 
any remuneration other than his fee as a Non-executive Director  
of the Company. 
T erms of reference for the Remuneration Committee have been 
approved by the Board and are available on the Company’s 
website at: www.fresnilloplc.com. 
Activity during 2016
During the year, the Committee met four times. A summary of its 
key activities during the year is set out in the Chairman’s Annual 
Statement on pages 138 and 139.

Advisors to the Remuneration Committee
Remuneration consultants are engaged by Group companies  
to provide benchmarking information on remuneration but not  
to provide guidance on the structure of remuneration. All of the 
consultants that the Group uses are independent of the Company. 
No remuneration consultants are directly engaged by the 
Remuneration Committee itself.
Benchmarking information on pay and employment conditions is 
supplied annually by Mercer, Hay Group and Data Compensation. 
The information provided is used across the Group in determining 
salaries for all employee grades including senior management. 
Whilst the Remuneration Committee takes such information into 
account when considering executive remuneration, none of these 
advisors are considered to materially assist the Remuneration 
Committee in the performance of its duties.
In addition, the Remuneration Committee receives specific  
reports comparing the remuneration of the members of the 
Executive Committee to international benchmarks. Willis T owers 
Watson have advised the Remuneration Committee in relation  
to the establishment of the Peer Group and the provision  
of benchmarking information showing the position of the 
remuneration, and particularly the salaries, of members of the 
Executive Committee in relation to the Peer Group. Willis T owers 
Watson provide general advice and benchmarking information  
to the Group concerning executive remuneration and during 2016, 
the Group paid Willis T owers Watson US$nil.
The Company Secretary ensures that the Remuneration 
Committee fulfils its duties under its terms of reference and 
provides regular updates to the Remuneration Committee  
on relevant regulatory developments in the UK.
The Group Human Resources Department provides information  
on Mexican market trends and compensation structures for the 
broader employee population in the Fresnillo Group.
AGM voting on the Remuneration Report 
The Remuneration Committee’s approach to executive 
remuneration has received strong support from shareholders at 
every Annual General Meeting since the Company’s listing on the 
London Stock Exchange in 2008. More than 99% of independent 
share votes cast on the advisory vote at each AGM have been in 
favour of the Directors’ Remuneration Report.

Statement of Directors’ Responsibilities
The Directors are responsible for preparing the annual report  
and the Group and parent company financial statements in 
accordance with applicable United Kingdom law and those 
International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) adopted  
by the European Union.
The Directors are required to prepare financial statements for  
each financial year which present a true and fair view of the 
financial position of the Company and of the Group and the 
financial performance and cash flows of the Company and of  
the Group for that period. In preparing those financial statements,  
the Directors are required to:
• select suitable accounting policies in accordance with IAS 8: 
‘Accounting Policies, Changes in Accounting Estimates and 
Errors’ and then apply them consistently;
• present information, including accounting policies, in a manner 
that provides relevant, reliable, comparable and understandable 
information;
• provide additional disclosures when compliance with the 
specific requirements in IFRS is insufficient to enable users to 
understand the impact of particular transactions, other events 
and conditions on the Company and of the Group’s financial 
position and financial performance;
• state that the Company and the Group has complied with IFRS, 
subject to any material departures disclosed and explained in 
the financial statements; and
• prepare the accounts on a going concern basis unless, having 
assessed the ability of the Company and the Group to continue 
as a going concern, management either intends to liquidate the 
entity or to cease trading, or have no realistic alternative but to 
do so.
The Directors are responsible for keeping proper accounting 
records which disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time  
the financial position of the Company and of the Group and  
enable them to ensure that the financial statements comply with 
the Companies Acts 2006 and Article 4 of the IAS Regulation. 
They are also responsible for safeguarding the assets of the 
Company and the Group and hence for taking reasonable steps  
for the prevention and detection of fraud and other irregularities.
Under applicable UK law and regulations the Directors are 
responsible for the preparation of a Directors’ report, Directors’ 
remuneration report and corporate governance report that  
comply with that law and regulations. In addition the Directors are 
responsible for the maintenance and integrity of the corporate and 
financial information included on the Company’s website. Legislation 
in the UK governing the preparation and dissemination of financial 
statements may differ from legislation in other jurisdictions.
Neither the Company nor the Directors accept any liability to  
any person in relation to the annual financial report except to the 
extent that such liability could arise under English law. Accordingly, 
any liability to a person who has demonstrated reliance on any 
untrue or misleading statement or omission shall be determined  
in accordance with section 90A and schedule 10A of the Financial 
Services and Markets Act 2000.
In accordance with provision C.1.1 of the UK Corporate Governance 
Code, the Directors consider that the Annual Report and Accounts, 
taken as a whole, is fair, balanced and understandable and provides 
information to enable shareholders to assess the Company’s 
performance, business model and strategy.
Responsibility statement of the Directors in respect of the 
annual report and accounts
I confirm on behalf of the Board that to the best of its knowledge:
a) the financial statements, prepared in accordance with 
International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by  
the European Union, give a true and fair view of the assets, 
liabilities, financial position and profit and loss of the Company 
and the undertakings included in the consolidation taken as  
a whole; and
b) the management report (encompassed within the ‘Overview’, 
‘Strategic report’, ‘Performance’ and ‘Governance’ sections) 
includes a fair review of the development and performance  
of the business, and the position of the Company and the 
undertakings included in the consolidation taken as a whole, 
together with a description of the principal risks and 
uncertainties that they face.

Overview of our audit approach
Risks of material misstatement • Recognition of related party transactions, including revenue recognition.
• Valuation of the Silverstream contract.
• Disclosures, provisions and asset recoverability arising from the El Bajío ejido litigation  
and land disputes.
• Estimation of mineral reserves and resources.
• Recoverability of investments in subsidiaries (Parent Company only).
Audit scope • We performed an audit of the complete financial information of five components, being  
the four operating mining units and the Parent Company. These components accounted for:
 – 100% of revenues; 
 – 104% of profit before tax excluding Silverstream revaluation effects; and,
 – 82% of total assets.
• In addition, we performed specified procedures on specific balances at a further five 
components. These components accounted for:
 – 100% of the Silverstream revaluation effects;
 – Negative 4% of Profit before tax excluding Silverstream revaluation effects; and,
 – 16% of total assets.
Materiality • We assessed overall Group materiality to be US$29.2 million which represents 5% of profit 
before tax excluding Silverstream revaluation effects.
Our assessment of risk of material misstatement
We identified the risks of material misstatement described below as those that had the greatest effect on our overall audit strategy,  
the allocation of resources in the audit and the direction of the efforts of the audit team. In addressing these risks, we have performed  
the procedures below which were designed in the context of the financial statements as a whole and, consequently, we do not express 
any opinion on these individual areas.
Independent Auditor’s Report
to the Members of Fresnillo plc 158
Fresnillo plc Annual Report 2016
Area of audit risk
Recognition of related party transactions, including revenue recognition u
• All of the Group’s current year revenue from the sale of production, and a significant amount of its expenses incurred, arise from 
transactions with related parties. These related parties are principally subsidiaries of the Group’s direct parent, Industrias Peñoles 
(‘Peñoles’). 
• Principal transactions include the sale of production to the Met-Mex refinery, administrative services received and the Silverstream 
contract.
• There is a risk that, if not at arm’s length or not reflecting the goods or services provided in the period, such transactions could  
be used to manipulate earnings or to distribute profits to the Group’s parent. 
• There is also a risk that revenues are inappropriately recognised as a result of incorrect cut-off or inappropriate measurement  
of product sold. 
Ü Our judgement is that the level of risk in this area remains consistent with the prior year.
We have not made significant changes to our audit response 
compared to the prior year, other than extending the use of  
data analysis.
Related party transactions are disclosed in note 27 to the 
consolidated financial statements and Revenues in note 4. 
Our audit response
Identification of related parties  
and related party transactions
•  We evaluated the appropriateness of management’s process for identifying, recording and 
reporting related party transactions.
•  We read contracts and agreements with related parties to understand the nature of the 
transactions.
•  Throughout the performance of our audit procedures, we remained alert for any related  
party transactions outside the normal course of business.
Revenue recognition • On a sample basis we performed testing to verify physical deliveries of product in the year.
•  We performed revenue cut-off testing.
•  We evaluated the appropriateness of the accounting for embedded derivatives arising from  
the provisional pricing terms in sales contracts.
•  We obtained an understanding of the basis of the treatment and refining charges negotiated 
between the Group and Peñoles for the current year, these being a deduction from revenues.
•  We compared actual revenues on a disaggregated basis to detailed expectations developed 
based on production in the year and market prices for relevant metals to identify and 
understand variances for further investigation.
Costs •  We utilised data analysis tools to interrogate entire data sets for potential related party 
transactions. 
•  We compared actual results against detailed expectations of income statement line items 
impacted by related party transactions to corroborate that there was no evidence of 
manipulation.
Silverstream contract •  We tested a sample of cash receipts in respect of silver payable under the contract in the year. 
The Silverstream contract is discussed separately below.
Accuracy of disclosures •  We verified that related party disclosures in the financial statements are consistent with the 
results of our audit procedures.
Key observations communicated to the Audit Committee
•  Our procedures did not identify issues with the identification, recording or reporting of related party transactions.
•  We concluded that revenue recognition in the year is appropriate, including the treatment of related provisional pricing terms.

FRESNILLO TODAY STRATEGIC REPORT CORPORATE GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Area of audit risk
Valuation of the Silverstream contract n
•  The valuation of the Silverstream contract, a derivative financial instrument, uses a discounted cash flow model. 
•  Key assumptions are the estimation of the reserves and resources and the related production profile of the Sabinas mine  
(owned and operated by Peñoles), future silver prices and the discount rate applied. These assumptions require management 
judgement and estimation. 
•  The resulting valuation is sensitive to changes in these assumptions which may result in material revaluation effects in the financial 
statements. 
	 Our judgement is that the level of risk in this area remains consistent with the prior year.
In response to the impact that the increase in Sabinas reserves and 
resources had on the valuation in the current year, we increased the 
extent of our procedures in this respect.
Details of the revaluation of the Silverstream contract are disclosed 
in note 14 to the consolidated financial statements. 
Our audit response
Valuation model •  In conjunction with our valuation specialists, we evaluated the appropriateness of the  
valuation approach and related model used by the Company to determine the fair value  
of the Silverstream contract under accounting standards. 
Reserves and resources  
and production profile  
of the Sabinas mine
•  We issued instructions to the auditor of Peñoles to perform and report to us on the following 
procedures with respect to the Sabinas mine:
 – conducting walkthroughs to confirm our understanding of Peñoles management’s processes 
to estimate quantities of reserves and resources and to develop the Sabinas mine plan;
 – testing of certain key Peñoles controls which address the risks associated with the estimation 
of reserves and resources quantities and accuracy of the resulting mine plan; 
 – gaining an understanding of reasons for changes in estimates of reserves and resources  
in the year;
 – assessing the professional competence, objectivity, and capabilities of Peñoles’ internal 
specialists involved in the estimation of reserves and resources quantities;
 – evaluating the reasonableness and appropriateness of inputs to the reserves and  
resources estimates and Sabinas mine plan as at 31 December 2016; and,
 – verifying that the Sabinas mine plan appropriately incorporates the reserves and  
resources estimate.
•  We discussed the results of the above procedures and reviewed key working papers. 
•  We interviewed the Sabinas mine geologist in order to understand the assumptions used  
in the estimation of reserves and resources and movements in the estimation in the year.
Key economic assumptions  
in the valuation
•  With assistance from our valuation specialists we corroborated key economic assumptions in  
the valuation, including future silver prices, foreign exchange rates and the discount rate applied. 
This included comparison to market data to consider the appropriateness of silver price and 
discount rate assumptions when considered together in the valuation model and analysis of  
the consistency of assumptions to other accounting estimates.
Key observations communicated to the Audit Committee
•  The valuation model is consistent with that used in prior periods and we consider this appropriate for the nature of this long-term 
derivative contract.
•  We concluded that the valuation of the Silverstream contract is reasonable as at 31 December 2016 and that the related gain 
recognised in income was appropriate. 160
Fresnillo plc Annual Report 2016
Area of audit risk
Disclosures, provisions and asset recoverability arising from the El Bajío ejido litigation and land disputes l
•  The El Bajío litigation and land disputes may create uncertainty around the Group’s ability to freely realise the carrying values of 
impacted assets in the Group’s balance sheet and may give rise to further asset impairment. Related assets are capitalised mining  
costs and inventory held in leaching pads at the impacted mine site.
•  The assessment of the recoverability of impacted assets and appropriate disclosure or provisions in the financial statements requires 
judgement about the future legal outcome of claims and land disputes and estimates of related financial impacts.
	 Our judgement is that there has been some reduction in the level of risk in this area as a result of rulings in favour of the Company.
This change in risk did not impact our audit response. Contingencies in respect of the El Bajío ejido litigation and land 
disputes are disclosed in note 26 to the consolidated financial 
statements.
Our audit response
Recoverability of assets •  We assessed management’s conclusion that there is sufficient likelihood of future economic 
benefits flowing from the use of assets impacted by the El Bajío land disputes that continue  
to be carried on the Group’s balance sheet.
•  We evaluated management’s assessment of related indicators of impairment in respect  
of those assets.
Inventory valuation •  We assessed management’s estimation of the recoverable value of inventory that is impacted  
by land disputes, including corroborating gold price assumptions to market data.
Future legal outcome of claims •  We evaluated management’s assessment of the current status of the El Bajío ejido litigation  
and claims against the Group and considered whether there is a requirement for any provision 
or related disclosures under accounting standards.
•  We obtained independent legal confirmation letters from the Group’s external lawyers  
advising on these issues, and assessed these for consistency with management’s conclusions. 
We assessed these lawyers as specialists engaged by management. 
•  We assessed the Group’s internal legal counsel as a management specialist.
Key observations communicated to the Audit Committee
• We concluded that, based on the facts and circumstances of the El Bajío ejido litigation and land disputes, management’s assessment 
that no provision is required and that the impacted assets are recoverable at 31 December 2016 is appropriate.
•  The legal confirmations we received supported management’s judgements in this area.
•  We consider that the disclosure in note 26 of related contingencies is also appropriate.

Estimation of mineral reserves and resources p
•  The estimation of mineral reserves and resources quantities of the Group’s mines requires significant judgement and estimation. 
•  The Group’s reserves and resources are audited by SRK Consulting (‘SRK’).
•  Reserves and resources, and related production profiles, are a key input to a number of areas impacting the financial statements,  
most significantly the recoverable value of mining assets and investments in subsidiaries (Parent Company only), the calculation  
of depletion, depreciation and amortisation, and the assessment of going concern and viability.
•  Additionally, reported reserves and resources may impact investor valuations of the Group. 
 Our judgement is that the level of risk in this area remains consistent with the prior year. 
We have not made significant changes to our audit response 
compared to the prior year.
The reserves and resources tables are presented on page 242,  
after the Parent Company notes. 
Our audit response
Estimation process •  We walked through the process of estimation of the reserves and resources quantities.
•  We identified key controls in this process and obtained evidence of their implementation. 
External specialists • We assessed SRK as a specialist engaged by management. 
•  Through discussions with SRK, we have gained an understanding of the scope of their work  
to verify that this was appropriate. 
•  We read the report of the external specialist and gained an understanding of the changes  
in reserves and resources estimates in the year.
Use of reserves and resources in 
financial statement calculations
•  We tested that the audited reserves and resources estimates have been appropriately applied  
to relevant areas of the Group’s financial statements.
Key observations communicated to the Audit Committee
•  We assessed SRK as an appropriate specialist engaged by management for the purposes of auditing the reserves and resources  
of the Group. 
•  We confirmed that the audited reserves and resources estimates have been appropriately used in relevant financial statement 
calculations. 162
Fresnillo plc Annual Report 2016
Area of audit risk
Recoverability of investments in subsidiaries (Parent Company only) s
•  Investments in subsidiaries are more sensitive to changes in recoverable value than the Group’s underlying mining assets because 
these investments were re-measured at fair value in 2008 when the Group was established ahead of the Initial Public Offering. 
•  Management’s assessment of the recoverable amount of investments in subsidiaries requires estimation and judgement around 
assumptions used. The principal driver of recoverable value is the estimated value of underlying mining assets held by the Group’s 
subsidiaries.
•  The key assumptions underpinning management’s assessment of the recoverable amount of mining assets are reserves and resources 
and related production profiles, estimated future operating and capital expenditure, future commodity prices and exchange rates and 
the discount rates applied.
•  Changes to assumptions could lead to material changes in estimated recoverable amounts, resulting in either impairment or reversals 
of impairment taken in prior years. 
  Our judgement is that the level of risk in this area remains consistent with the prior year but is now principally relating to the reversal  
of impairment recognised in prior years (rather than impairment) as a result of strengthening metals prices.
We have not made significant changes to our audit response 
compared to the prior year.
Management’s assessment of the significant judgement and 
estimation required is set out in note 2(c) to the Parent Company 
financial statements and sensitivities to changes in price which  
may result in impairment are set out in note 6.
Our audit response
Indicators of impairment and 
methodology used to estimate 
recoverable values
•  We have reviewed management’s identification of indicators of impairment under accounting 
standards.
•  We have assessed the methodology used by management to estimate the recoverable value  
of each investment for which an impairment test was performed to ensure that this is consistent 
with accounting standards. This included the valuation of underlying mining assets.
•  We have assessed the valuation models used by management to estimate the recoverable value 
of each investment, in conjunction with any intra-Group balances.
Key internal assumptions used in 
management’s estimate of the 
recoverable values of mining assets
•  We have verified reserves and resources quantities underpinning the mine plans by comparing 
these to estimates audited by SRK, a specialist engaged by management. 
•  We assessed the professional competence, objectivity and capabilities of SRK as a specialist 
engaged by management. 
•  We agreed related production profiles to the current mine plans for each mine and considered 
their consistency with our understanding of future plans at the mines obtained through 
interviews with both operating and senior management.
•  We assessed operating and capital costs included in the cash flow forecasts for consistency  
with current operating costs and forecast mine production.
Key external assumptions used in 
management’s estimate of the 
recoverable values of mining assets
•  Working with our valuation specialists we have assessed management’s assumptions relating  
to future metals prices and discount rates, comparing these to market data and also for 
consistency with other estimates used in the financial statements.
•  We have performed sensitivity analysis on management’s calculated recoverable values for 
alternative assumptions around silver prices and the discount rate applied.
Key observations communicated to the Audit Committee
•  We consider the approach to determining the recoverable value of each investment tested for impairment to be appropriate.
•  Our procedures confirmed that the reserves and resources and related production profiles are consistent with the estimates audited  
by SRK and respective mine plans.
•  Our procedures confirmed that the estimates of operating and capital costs are consistent with the production profiles of respective 
mines and related mine plans.
•  We concluded that the carrying values of investments in subsidiaries, after reversals of impairments as reflected in the Parent 
Company financial statements, are reasonable.

Fresnillo plc Annual Report 2016
FRESNILLO TODAY STRATEGIC REPORT CORPORATE GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Changes in our assessment of the risks of material misstatement as compared with those reported in the prior year are:
•  In the prior year, our auditor’s report included a risk of material misstatement in relation to the recoverability of mining assets.  
With the strengthening of gold and silver prices and the weakening of the Mexican peso reducing mining costs we do not consider  
this to be a risk of material misstatement in the current year for the Group financial statements. 
•  The recoverable amount of investments in subsidiaries (Parent Company only), remains a risk of material misstatement.  
The recoverability of underlying mining assets is a key driver of related recoverable values so remains an area of audit focus  
in this context. 
The scope of our audit
Tailoring the scope
Our assessment of audit risk, our evaluation of materiality and our allocation of performance materiality determine our audit scope for 
each entity within the Group. T aken together, this enables us to form an opinion on the consolidated financial statements. We take into 
account size, risk profile and the organisation of the Group and the effectiveness of Group-wide controls and other factors such as the 
results of the work of Internal Audit when assessing the level of work to be performed at each entity.
We performed an audit of the complete financial information of five components (2015: five) (‘full scope components’) which were selected 
based on their size or risk characteristics. These components are the four operating mining units in Mexico and the Parent Company.
We also performed specified audit procedures on specific account balances in a further five components (2015: five classified as specific  
scope components). The procedures were on those account balances within those components which we deemed to be significant  
either because of the size of these accounts or their risk profile. These accounts included taxation, mine closure provisions, cash and  
cash equivalents and all balances relating to the Silverstream contract.
The reporting components where we performed audit procedures represented:
Key 
 Full scope    Specific scope    Specified procedures    Other procedures
The audit scope of components at which we have performed specified procedures (2015: Specific scope components) may not have 
included testing of all significant accounts of the component but will have contributed to the coverage reflected above. 
The remaining components together represent an effect on the Group’s Profit before tax excluding Silverstream revaluation effects of  
less than 1% (2015: (6)%) and 2% of total assets (2015: 1%). For these components, we performed other procedures, including analytical 
review and testing of consolidation journals and intercompany eliminations to respond to any potential risks of material misstatement  
of the Group financial statements.
Changes from the prior year
There were no significant changes in our scoping as compared to the prior year. We have performed specified procedures in 2016  
on the same five components that were classified as specific scope in 2015. Related audit procedures at these components have not 
significantly changed.

The primary engagement team, including the Senior Statutory Auditor, visited Mexico five times during the audit, during both the planning 
and execution phases, with members of the team working with and supervising the component team in Mexico for a number of weeks. 
These visits involved discussion and oversight of the component team audit approach, consideration of any accounting and auditing 
issues arising from their work, reviewing key audit working papers, meeting with management and attending closing meetings. 
Senior members of the component team attended a Global T eam Planning Event in the planning phase of the audit and the primary  
team interacted regularly with the local team between visits to Mexico as appropriate. The primary engagement team is predominantly 
composed of Spanish speakers in order to further enhance our interactions with both the component team and management.
The primary team was responsible for the scope and direction of the audit process. For certain procedures, in particular areas involving 
significant judgement and heightened audit risk, we performed work ourselves with support where required from the component team.  
In other cases, we reviewed key working papers including, but not limited to, the risk areas described above. 
The audit work at the ten components was executed at levels of performance materiality applicable to each individual component  
as allocated by the primary team and discussed below. 
This involvement with the local component team in Mexico, together with the additional procedures performed at Group level, gave us 
appropriate evidence for our opinion on the Group financial statements.
Our application of materiality 
We apply the concept of materiality in planning and performing the audit, in evaluating the effect of identified misstatements on the  
audit and in forming our audit opinion. 
Materiality
The magnitude of an omission or misstatement that, individually or in the aggregate, could reasonably be expected to influence the 
economic decisions of the users of the financial statements. Materiality provides a basis for determining the nature and extent of our  
audit procedures.
We determined materiality for the Group to be US$29.2 million (2015: US$9.2 million), which is 5% (2015: 5%) of profit before tax prior  
to Silverstream revaluation effects. This is a consistent basis to 2015. We believe that this measure of profit represents one of the principal 
considerations for members of the Group, particularly as the Silverstream revaluation effects are principally non-cash in nature.
 
During the course of our audit, we reassessed initial planning materiality and updated its calculation for the actual financial results of  
the year. This resulted in planning materiality increasing by US$3.3 million.
Performance materiality
The application of materiality at the individual account or balance level. It is set at an amount to reduce to an appropriately low level  
the probability that the aggregate of uncorrected and undetected misstatements exceeds materiality.
On the basis of our risk assessments, together with our assessment of the Group’s overall control environment, it is our judgement  
that performance materiality is 75% (2015: 75%) of our planning materiality, namely US$21.9 million (2015: US$6.9 million). We based  
this judgement on factors including the past history of misstatements, our ability to assess the likelihood of misstatements and the 
effectiveness of the internal control environment. 
Audit work at component locations for the purpose of obtaining audit coverage over significant financial statement accounts is 
undertaken based on a percentage of total performance materiality. The performance materiality set for each component is based  
on the relative scale and risk of the component to the Group as a whole and our assessment of the risk of misstatement at that 
component. The performance materiality allocated to full-scope components in the current year is set out in the graph on page 165.

Fresnillo plc Annual Report 2016
FRESNILLO TODAY STRATEGIC REPORT CORPORATE GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Allocated performance materiality increased in respect of all components, reflecting the overall performance of the Group and the 
individual contributions of the components to that performance. 
*  The risk icons correspond to the risks set out above. Audit procedures in respect of the recoverable amount of investments in subsidiaries are performed at the performance 
materiality of the standalone parent financial statements.
Reporting threshold
An amount below which identified misstatements are considered as being clearly trivial.
We agreed with the Audit Committee that we would report to them all uncorrected audit differences in excess of 5% of planning 
materiality, being US$1.5 million (2015: US$0.5 million), as well as differences below that threshold that, in our view, warrant reporting  
on qualitative grounds. 
We evaluate any uncorrected misstatements against both the quantitative measures of materiality discussed above and in light  
of other relevant qualitative considerations in forming our opinion.
Scope of the audit of the financial statements
An audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements sufficient to give reasonable 
assurance that the financial statements are free from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or error. This includes an 
assessment of: whether the accounting policies are appropriate to the Group and the Parent Company’s circumstances and have been 
consistently applied and adequately disclosed; the reasonableness of significant accounting estimates made by the Directors; and the 
overall presentation of the financial statements. In addition, we read all the financial and non-financial information in the 2016 Annual 
Report to identify material inconsistencies with the audited financial statements and to identify any information that is apparently 
materially incorrect based on, or materially inconsistent with, the knowledge acquired by us in the course of performing the audit.  
If we become aware of any apparent material misstatements or inconsistencies we consider the implications for our report.
Respective responsibilities of Directors and auditor
As explained more fully in the Directors’ Responsibilities Statement set out on page 156, the Directors are responsible for the preparation 
of the financial statements and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view. Our responsibility is to audit and express an opinion 
on the financial statements in accordance with applicable law and International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland). Those standards 
require us to comply with the Auditing Practices Board’s Ethical Standards for Auditors.
This report is made solely to the Company’s members, as a body, in accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies Act 2006. 
Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might state to the Company’s members those matters we are required to state to them in 
an auditor’s report and for no other purpose. T o the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility to anyone 
other than the Company and the Company’s members as a body, for our audit work, for this report, or for the opinions we have formed. 
Opinion on other matters prescribed by the Companies Act 2006
In our opinion:
• the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited has been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies  
Act 2006; 
•  the information given in the Strategic Report and the Directors’ Report for the financial year for which the financial statements  
are prepared is consistent with the financial statements; and
•  the information given in the Corporate Governance Statement set out on pages 112 to 155 in the 2016 Annual Report with respect  
to internal control and risk management systems in relation to financial reporting processes and about share capital structures  
is consistent with the financial statements.

Matters on which we are required to report by exception
ISAs (UK and Ireland) reporting 
We are required to report to you if, in our opinion, financial and non-financial information  
in the Annual Report is: 
•  materially inconsistent with the information in the audited financial statements; or 
•  apparently materially incorrect based on, or materially inconsistent with, our knowledge  
of the Group acquired in the course of performing our audit; or 
• otherwise misleading.  
In particular, we are required to report whether we have identified any inconsistencies between our 
knowledge acquired in the course of performing the audit and the Directors’ statement that they 
consider the Annual Report and accounts taken as a whole is fair, balanced and understandable and 
provides the information necessary for shareholders to assess the entity’s performance, business 
model and strategy; and whether the Annual Report appropriately addresses those matters that  
we communicated to the Audit Committee that we consider should have been disclosed.
We have no exceptions to report.
Companies Act 2006 reporting 
We are required to report to you if, in our opinion:
• adequate accounting records have not been kept by the Parent Company, or returns adequate  
for our audit have not been received from branches not visited by us; or
•  the Parent Company financial statements and the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report  
to be audited are not in agreement with the accounting records and returns; or
•  certain disclosures of Directors’ remuneration specified by law are not made; or
•  we have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit.
We have no exceptions to report.
Listing Rules review requirements 
We are required to review:
•  The Directors’ statement in relation to going concern, set out on page 55, and longer-term viability, 
set out on pages 54 and 55; and
•  the part of the Corporate Governance Statement relating to the Company’s compliance with  
the provisions of the UK Corporate Governance Code specified for our review.
We have no exceptions to report.
Statement on the Directors’ assessment of the principal risks that would threaten the solvency or liquidity of the entity
IISAs (UK and Ireland) reporting 
We are required to give a statement as to whether we have anything material to add or to draw 
attention to in relation to:
•  the Directors’ confirmation in the Annual Report that they have carried out a robust assessment  
of the principal risks facing the entity, including those that would threaten its business model, 
future performance, solvency or liquidity;
• the disclosures in the Annual Report that describe those risks and explain how they are being 
managed or mitigated;
•  the Directors’ statement in the financial statements about whether they considered it appropriate 
to adopt the going concern basis of accounting in preparing them, and their identification of any 
material uncertainties to the entity’s ability to continue to do so over a period of at least 12 months 
from the date of approval of the financial statements; and
•  the Directors’ explanation in the Annual Report as to how they have assessed the prospects of the 
entity, over what period they have done so and why they consider that period to be appropriate, 
and their statement as to whether they have a reasonable expectation that the entity will be able 
to continue in operation and meet its liabilities as they fall due over the period of their assessment, 
including any related disclosures drawing attention to any necessary qualifications or assumptions.
We have nothing material to add  
or to draw attention to.

Fresnillo plc Annual Report 2016
1. Corporate information
Fresnillo plc. (‘the Company’) is a public limited company and registered in England and Wales with registered number 6344120 and  
is the holding company for the Fresnillo subsidiaries detailed in note 5 of the Parent Company accounts (‘the Group’).
Industrias Peñoles S.A.B. de C. V . (‘Peñoles’) currently owns 75% of the shares of the Company and the ultimate controlling party of the 
Company is the Baillères family, whose beneficial interest is held through Peñoles. The registered address of Peñoles is Calzada Legaria 549, 
Mexico City 11250. Copies of Peñoles’ accounts can be obtained from www.penoles.com.mx. Further information on related party balances 
and transactions with Peñoles’ group companies is disclosed in note 27 .
The consolidated financial statements of the Group for the year ended 31 December 2016 were authorised for issue by the Board  
of Directors of Fresnillo plc on 27 February 2017.
The Group’s principal business is the mining and beneficiation of non-ferrous minerals, and the sale of related production. The primary 
contents of this production are silver, gold, lead and zinc. Further information about the Group operating mines and its principal activities 
is disclosed in note 3.
2. Significant accounting policies
(a) Basis of preparation and consolidation, and statement of compliance
Basis of preparation and statement of compliance
The Group’s consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards  
(IFRS) as adopted by the European Union as they apply to the financial statements of the Group for the years ended 31 December 2016 
and 2015, and in accordance with the provisions of the Companies Act 2006. 
The consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a historical cost basis, except for derivative financial instruments,  
available-for-sale financial assets and defined benefit pension scheme assets which have been measured at fair value.
The consolidated financial statements are presented in dollars of the United States of America (US dollars or US$) and all values  
are rounded to the nearest thousand ($000) except when otherwise indicated.
Basis of consolidation
The consolidated financial statements set out the Group’s financial position as of 31 December 2016 and 2015, and the results of 
operations and cash flows for the years then ended.
Entities that constitute the Group are those enterprises controlled by the Group regardless of the number of shares owned by the Group. 
The Group controls an entity when the Group is exposed to, or has the right to, variable returns from its involvement with the entity  
and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the entity. Entities are consolidated from the date on which control is 
transferred to the Group and cease to be consolidated from the date on which control is transferred out of the Group. The Group applies 
the acquisition method to account for business combinations in accordance with IFRS 3.
All intra-Group balances, transactions, income and expenses and profits and losses, including unrealised profits arising from intra-Group 
transactions, have been eliminated on consolidation. Unrealised losses are eliminated in the same way as unrealised gains except that  
they are only eliminated to the extent that there is no evidence of impairment.
Non-controlling interests in the net assets of consolidated subsidiaries are identified separately from the Group’s equity therein.  
The interest of non-controlling shareholders may be initially measured either at fair value or at the non-controlling interest’s proportionate 
share of the acquiree’s identifiable net assets. The choice of measurement basis is made on an acquisition by-acquisition basis. Subsequent 
to acquisition, non-controlling interests consist of the amount attributed to such interests at initial recognition and the non-controlling 
interest’s share of changes in equity since the date of the combination. Any losses of a subsidiary are attributed to the non-controlling 
interests even if that results in a deficit balance.
Transactions with non-controlling interests that do not result in loss of control are accounted for as equity transactions – that is, a 
transaction with the owners in their capacity as owners. The difference between fair value of any consideration paid and the relevant 
share acquired of the carrying value of net assets of the subsidiary is recorded in equity. Gains or losses on disposals to non-controlling 
interest are also recorded in equity.
(b) Changes in accounting policies and disclosures
The accounting policies applied are consistent with those applied in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements for the year 
ended 31 December 2015. During 2016, there were no amendments to existing accounting policies.
As at 31 December 2015, derivatives relating to the gold hedging programme initiated in 2014 that mature after one year had been 
presented as current assets. During 2016, the Group restated the prior year comparatives and reclassified these derivatives to non-current 
assets. The reclassification resulted in an increase in non-current assets and a corresponding reduction in current assets by US$97.5 million 
as at 31 December 2015, with no impact on previously reported profit, other comprehensive income, liabilities, equity, cash flow or earnings 
per share. In addition, there is no tax effect and no impact on segmental disclosures.
New standards, interpretations and amendments (new standards) adopted by the Group
The Group has adopted ‘IAS 1 Disclosure Initiative – Amendments to IAS 1’. The amendments clarify existing requirements on materiality, 
aggregation and disaggregation in the preparation of financial statements and presentation of the notes. This amendment had no impact 
in the financial information of the Group.

2. Significant accounting policies continued
Other than the above mentioned amendment there were no significant new standards that the Group was required to adopt effective 
from 1 January 2016.
Standards, interpretations and amendments issued but not yet effective
The standards and interpretations that are issued, but not yet effective, up to the date of issuance of the Group’s financial statements  
are disclosed below. The Group intends to adopt these standards, as applicable to the Group’s financial statements, when they become 
effective, except where indicated.
IFRS 9 Financial Instruments: In July 2014, the IASB issued the final version of IFRS 9 Financial Instruments which concludes all phases  
of the financial instruments project and replaces IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement and all previous versions  
of IFRS 9. IFRS 9 is effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2018, with early application permitted. The Group plans  
to adopt IFRS 9 Financial instruments from the mandatory effective date. The Group has completed a preliminary assessment of the 
expected major impacts of this standard, the most relevant are set out below.
Nature of change IFRS 9 addresses the classification and measurement of financial assets and financial liabilities, introduces  
new rules for hedge accounting and a new impairment model for financial assets. The derecognition rules  
are consistent with those under IAS 39.
Main impact IFRS 9 makes significant changes in the classification of financial assets. Whereas under IAS 39, the default 
classification for financial assets was available-for-sale financial assets, under IFRS 9 the residual category  
is to recognise fair value through profit or loss (FVTPL).
Generally under IFRS 9, investments in equity instruments are recognised as FVTPL unless the Group makes an 
election, in respect of investments that are not held for trading, to measure the instruments at fair value through 
OCI (FVOCI). The Group expects to designate all investments currently recognised in available-for-sale financial 
assets as FVOCI. 
In accordance with IFRS 9, this means that all movements relating to such assets are recognised in OCI. Neither 
gains nor losses on disposal or significant or prolonged declines in the value of these investments are recognised 
in profit or loss.
Hedge accounting
The new hedge accounting rules will align the accounting for hedging instruments more closely with the Group’s 
risk management practices.
IFRS 9 changes the accounting requirements for the time value of purchased options where only the intrinsic 
value of such options has been designated as the hedging instrument. In such cases, changes in the time value  
of options are initially recognised in OCI. Amounts related to the time value of options are reclassified to profit or 
loss or as a basis adjustment to assets or liabilities upon maturity of the hedged item, or, in the case of a hedged 
item that realises over time, over the life of the hedged item. Under IAS 39, the change in time value of options  
is recorded in the income statement.
Impairment model
The new impairment model requires the recognition of impairment provisions based on expected credit losses 
(ECL) rather than on the basis of credit losses incurred as is the case under IAS 39. It will apply to Group’s 
financial assets classified at amortised cost and debt instruments measured at FVOCI.
IFRS 9 also sets out a simplified approach for traded and lease receivables that do not contain a significant 
financing component in accordance with IFRS 15.
Expected date of 
adoption by Group  
and considerations
The Group plans to adopt IFRS 9 effective 1 January 2018 and plans to apply the limited exemption relating  
to transition for classification and measurement and impairment, and accordingly will not restate comparative 
periods in the year of initial application. 
Generally, the change in hedge requirements are accounted for prospectively; however, in the case of the 
recognition of time value of options in OCI, this is adjusted for retrospectively. The Group expects the adjustment 
from retained earnings to hedging reserve as at 1 January 2017, the beginning of the comparative period for the 
year of implementation, to be US$23.0 million, reflecting the time value of the open positions as at 1 January 2017. 
In the year ended 31 December 2016, this amount was recognised in finance cost, in accordance with IAS 39. 174

IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers: IFRS 15 was issued in May 2014 and establishes a five-step model to account for 
revenue arising from contracts with customers. The new revenue standard will supersede all current revenue recognition requirements 
under IFRS. Early adoption is permitted. IFRS 15 is effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2018, with early application 
permitted. The Group plans to adopt IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers from the mandatory effective date. The Group has 
completed a preliminary assessment of the expected major impacts of this standard, the most relevant are set out below.
Nature of change IFRS 15 establishes a comprehensive framework for recognition of revenue from contracts with customers  
based on a core principle that an entity should recognise revenue representing the transfer of promised goods  
or services to customers at an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled  
in exchange for those goods or services.
Main impact As described in the accounting policies section, The Group’s revenue is derived from one revenue stream  
that corresponds to the sale of goods (concentrates, precipitates and doré bars). The Group has evaluated 
recognition and measurement of revenue based on the five-step model in IFRS 15 and has not identified any 
material expected financial impacts.
IFRS 15 includes disclosure requirements to enable users of the financial statements to understand the amount, 
timing, risk and judgements related to revenue recognition and related cash flows. Certain disclosures will change 
as a result of the requirements of IFRS 15. The Group expects this to include a breakdown of revenue from 
customers and revenue from other sources, including the movement in the value of embedded derivatives  
in sales contracts.
Expected date of 
adoption by Group  
and considerations
The Group plans to adopt IFRS 15 effective 1 January 2018 and to apply the simplified transition method, hence 
the cumulative effect of adoption, if any, will be recognised in retained earnings. The Group currently expects  
the cumulative effect to be nil. 
IFRS 16 Leases
IFRS 16 introduces a single lessee accounting model and requires a lessee to recognise assets and liabilities for all leases with a term  
of more than 12 months, unless the underlying asset is of low value. A lessee is required to recognise a right-of-use asset representing  
its right to use the underlying leased asset and a lease liability representing its obligation to make lease payments. IFRS 16 substantially 
carries forward the lessor accounting requirements in IAS 17. Accordingly, a lessor continues to classify its leases as operating leases or 
finance leases, and to account for those two types of leases differently. These amendments are effective for annual periods beginning  
on or after 1 January 2019 and earlier application is permitted. However, as there are several interactions between IFRS 16 and IFRS 15 
Revenue from contracts with customers, early application is restricted to entities that also early adopt IFRS 15. The Group is currently 
assessing the impact of IFRS 16 and is considering early adoption in 2018 to align with the adoption of IFRS 9 and IFRS 15.
Amendments to IAS 7 Disclosure Initiative
The amendments require an entity to provide disclosures that enable users of financial statements to evaluate changes in liabilities arising 
from financing activities, including both changes arising from cash flows and non-cash changes. The amendments do not prescribe a 
specific format to disclose financing activities; however, an entity may fulfil the disclosure objective by providing reconciliation between 
the opening and closing balances in the statement of financial position for liabilities arising from financing activities.
The amendments apply prospectively for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2017 with earlier application permitted. Entities 
are not required to present comparative information for earlier periods. The amendments to this standard are not expected to have any 
impact in the financial information of the Group.
Amendments to IAS 12 Income T axes
The amendments to IAS 12 clarify the accounting for deferred tax where an asset is measured at fair value and that fair value is below the 
asset’s tax base. They also clarify certain other aspects of accounting for deferred tax assets. These amendments are effective for annual 
periods beginning on or after 1 January 2017 with early adoption permitted. The amendments to this standard are not expected to have 
any impact in the financial information of the Group.
IFRIC 22 Foreign currency transactions and advance consideration
IFRIC 22 provides requirements about which exchange rate to use in reporting foreign currency transactions when payment is made  
or received in advance. The interpretation requires the Company to determine a ‘date of transaction’ for the purposes of selecting an 
exchange rate to use on initial recognition of the related asset, expense or income. In case there are multiple payments or receipts in 
advance, the entity should determine a date of the transaction for each flow of advance consideration. IFRIC 22 is applicable for annual 
periods beginning on or after 1 January 2018 and earlier adoption is permitted. The interpretation is not expected to have any impact  
in the financial information of the Group.
The IASB has issued other amendments to standards that management considers do not have any impact on the accounting policies, 
financial position or performance of the Group. 
The Group has not early adopted any standard, interpretation or amendment that was issued but is not yet effective.

(c) Significant accounting judgements, estimates and assumptions
The preparation of the Group’s consolidated financial statements in conformity with IFRS requires management to make judgements, 
estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities at the date of the consolidated 
financial statements and reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. These judgements and estimates are 
based on management’s best knowledge of the relevant facts and circumstances, with regard to prior experience, but actual results may 
differ from the amounts included in the consolidated financial statements. Information about such judgements and estimates is contained 
in the accounting policies and/or the notes to the consolidated financial statements.
Judgements
Areas of judgement, apart from those involving estimations, that have the most significant effect on the amounts recognised in the 
consolidated financial statements are:
• Determination of functional currency (note 2 (d)):
 The determination of functional currency requires management judgement, particularly where there may be several currencies  
in which transactions are undertaken and which impact the economic environment in which the entity operates.
• Evaluation of the status of projects (note 2 (e)):
 The evaluation of project status impacts the accounting for costs incurred and requires management judgement. This includes the 
assessment of whether there is sufficient evidence of the probability of the existence of economically recoverable minerals to justify 
the commencement of capitalisation of costs, the timing of the end of the exploration phase and the start of the development phase 
and the commencement of the production phase. These judgements directly impact the treatment of costs incurred and proceeds 
from the sale of metals from ore produced.
• Stripping costs (note 2 (e)):
 The Group incurs waste removal costs (stripping costs) during the development and production phases of its surface mining 
operations. During the production phase, stripping costs (production stripping costs) can be incurred both in relation to the 
production of inventory in that period and the creation of improved access and mining flexibility in relation to ore to be mined  
in the future. The former are included as part of the costs of inventory, while the latter are capitalised as a stripping activity asset, 
where certain criteria are met.
  Once the Group has identified production stripping for a surface mining operation, judgement is required in identifying the separate 
components of the ore bodies for that operation, to which stripping costs should be allocated. Generally a component is a specific 
volume of the ore body that is made more accessible by the stripping activity. In identifying components of the ore body, the Group 
works closely with the mining operations personnel to analyse each of the mine plans. The mine plans and, therefore, the identification 
of components, will vary between mines for a number of reasons. These include, but are not limited to, the type of commodity,  
the geological characteristics of the ore body, the geographical location and/or financial considerations. The Group reassesses the 
components of ore bodies annually in line with the preparation of mine plans. In the current year, this reassessment did not give rise  
to any changes in the identification of components.
 
 Once production stripping costs have been identified, judgement is also required to identify a suitable production measure to be used 
to allocate production stripping costs between inventory and any stripping activity asset(s) for each component. The Group considers 
that the ratio of the expected tonnes of waste to be stripped for an expected tonnes of ore to be mined for a specific component  
of the ore body is the most suitable production measure.
 Furthermore, judgements and estimates are also used to apply the units of production method in determining the depreciable lives  
of the stripping activity asset(s).
• Qualifying assets (note 2 (e)):
 All interest-bearing loans are held by the parent company and were not obtained for any specific asset’s acquisition, construction,  
or production. Funds from these loans are transferred to subsidiaries to meet the strategic objectives of the Group or are otherwise 
held centrally. Due to this financing structure, judgement is required in determining whether those borrowings are attributable to the 
acquisition, construction or production of a qualifying asset. Therefore, management determines whether borrowings are attributable 
to an asset or group of assets based on whether the investment in an operating or development stage project is classified as 
contributing to achieving the strategic growth of the Group.
• Contingencies (note 26):
 By their nature, contingencies will be resolved only when one or more uncertain future events occur or fail to occur. The assessment  
of the existence and potential quantum of contingencies inherently involves the exercise of significant judgement and the use of 
estimates regarding the outcome of future events. 176

Estimates and assumptions
Significant areas of estimation uncertainty considered by management in preparing the consolidated financial statements include:
•  Estimated recoverable ore reserves and mineral resources, note 2(e):
 Ore reserves are estimates of the amount of ore that can be economically and legally extracted from the Group’s mining properties; 
mineral resources are an identified mineral occurrence with reasonable prospects for eventual economic extraction. The Group 
estimates its ore reserves and mineral resources based on information compiled by appropriately qualified persons relating to the 
geological and technical data on the size, depth, shape and grade of the ore body and suitable production techniques and recovery 
rates, in conformity with the Joint Ore Reserves Committee (JORC) code 2012. Such an analysis requires complex geological 
judgements to interpret the data. The estimation of recoverable ore reserves and mineral resources is based upon factors such  
as geological assumptions and judgements made in estimating the size and grade of the ore body, estimates of commodity prices, 
foreign exchange rates, future capital requirements and production costs.
 As additional geological information is produced during the operation of a mine, the economic assumptions used and the estimates  
of ore reserves and mineral resources may change. Such changes may impact the Group’s reported balance sheet and income 
statement including:
 – The carrying value of property, plant and equipment and mining properties may be affected due to changes in estimated future 
cash flows, which consider both ore reserves and mineral resources.
 – Depreciation and amortisation charges in the income statement may change where such charges are determined using the 
unit-of-production method based on ore reserves.
 – Stripping costs capitalised in the statement of financial position, either as part of mine properties or inventory, or charged to profit 
or loss may change due to changes in stripping ratios.
 – Provisions for mine closure costs may change where changes to the ore reserve and resources estimates affect expectations about 
when such activities will occur.
 – The recognition and carrying value of deferred income tax assets may change due to changes regarding the existence of such 
assets and in estimates of the likely recovery of such assets.
• Determination of useful lives of assets for depreciation and amortisation purposes, notes 2 (e) and 12:
 Estimates are required to be made by management as to the useful lives of assets. For depreciation calculated under the unit-of-
production method, estimated recoverable reserves are used in determining the depreciation and/or amortisation of mine specific 
assets. Depreciation/amortisation charge is proportional to the depletion of the estimated remaining life of mine of production. 
Estimated useful lives of other assets are based on the expected usage of the asset. Each item’s life, which is assessed annually,  
has regard to both its physical life limitations and to expectations of the use of the asset by the Group, including with reference  
to present assessments of economically recoverable reserves of the mine property at which the asset is used.
• Silverstream, note 14:
 The valuation of the Silverstream contract as a derivative financial instrument requires significant estimation by management.  
The term of the derivative is based on Sabinas life of mine which is currently 20 years and the value of this derivative is determined 
using a number of estimates, including the estimated recoverable ore reserves and mineral resources and future production profile of 
the Sabinas mine, the estimated recoveries of silver from ore mined, estimates of the future price of silver and the discount rate used  
to discount future cash flows. For further detail on the inputs that have a significant effect on the fair value of this derivative, see note 
30. The impact of changes in silver price assumptions, foreign exchange, inflation and the discount rate is included in note 31.
• Assessment of recoverability of property plant and equipment and impairment charges, note 2 (f):
 The recoverability of an asset requires the use of estimates and assumptions such as long-term commodity prices, reserves and 
resources and the associated production profiles, discount rates, future capital requirements, exploration potential and operating 
performance. Changes in these assumptions will affect the recoverable amount of the property, plant and equipment.
• Estimation of the mine closure costs, notes 2 (l) and 21:
 Significant estimates and assumptions are made in determining the provision for mine closure cost as there are numerous factors that 
will affect the ultimate liability payable. These factors include estimates of the extent and costs of rehabilitation activities, technological 
changes, regulatory changes, cost increases, mine life and changes in discount rates. Those uncertainties may result in future actual 
expenditure differing from the amounts currently provided. The provision at the balance sheet date represents management’s best 
estimate of the present value of the future closure costs required.
• Income tax, notes 2 (r) and 10:
 Deferred tax assets, including those arising from un-utilised tax losses require management to assess the likelihood that the Group  
will generate taxable earnings in future periods, in order to utilise recognised deferred tax assets. Estimates of future taxable income 
are based on forecast cash flows from operations and the application of existing tax laws in each jurisdiction. T o the extent that  
future cash flows and taxable income differ significantly from estimates, the ability of the Group to realise the net deferred tax assets 
recorded at the balance sheet date could be impacted.

(d) Foreign currency translation
The Group’s consolidated financial statements are presented in US dollars, which is the Parent Company’s functional currency.  
The functional currency for each entity in the Group is determined by the currency of the primary economic environment in which  
it operates. For all operating entities, this is US dollars.
Transactions denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the entity are translated at the exchange rate ruling at the 
date of the transaction. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are re-translated at the rate of exchange ruling  
at the balance sheet date. All differences that arise are recorded in the income statement. Non-monetary items that are measured in terms 
of historical cost in a foreign currency are translated using the exchange rates as at the dates of the initial transactions. Non-monetary 
items measured at fair value in a foreign currency are translated into US dollars using the exchange rate at the date when the fair value 
is determined.
For entities with functional currencies other than US dollars as at the reporting date, assets and liabilities are translated into the  
reporting currency of the Group by applying the exchange rate at the balance sheet date and the income statement is translated at  
the average exchange rate for the year. The resulting difference on exchange is included as a cumulative translation adjustment in other 
comprehensive income. On disposal of an entity, the deferred cumulative amount recognised in other comprehensive income relating  
to that operation is recognised in the income statement.
(e) Property, plant and equipment
Property, plant and equipment is stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment, if any. Cost comprises the purchase price 
and any costs directly attributable to bringing the asset into working condition for its intended use. The cost of self-constructed assets 
includes the cost of materials, direct labour and an appropriate proportion of production overheads.
The cost less the residual value of each item of property, plant and equipment is depreciated over its useful life. Each item’s estimated 
useful life has been assessed with regard to both its own physical life limitations and the present assessment of economically recoverable 
reserves of the mine property at which the item is located. Estimates of remaining useful lives are made on a regular basis for all mine 
buildings, machinery and equipment, with annual reassessments for major items. Depreciation is charged to cost of sales on a unit-of-
production (UOP) basis for mine buildings and installations, plant and equipment used in the mine production process or on a straight line 
basis over the estimated useful life of the individual asset when not related to the mine production process. Changes in estimates, which 
mainly affect unit-of-production calculations, are accounted for prospectively. Depreciation commences when assets are available for use. 
Land is not depreciated.
The expected useful lives are as follows:
Years
Buildings 6
Plant and equipment 4
Mining properties and development costs 
1
16
Other assets 3
1. Depreciation of mining properties and development cost are determined using the unit-of-production method.
An item of property, plant and equipment is de-recognised upon disposal or when no future economic benefits are expected from its  
use or disposal. Any gain or loss arising at de-recognition of the asset (calculated as the difference between the net disposal proceeds 
and the carrying amount of the asset) is included in the income statement in the year that the asset is de-recognised.
Non-current assets or disposal groups are classified as held for sale when it is expected that the carrying amount of the asset will be 
recovered principally through sale rather than through continuing use. Assets are not depreciated when classified as held for sale.
Disposal of assets
Gains or losses from the disposal of assets are recognised in the income statement when all significant risks and rewards of ownership  
are transferred to the customer, usually when title has been passed.
Mining properties and development costs
Payments for mining concessions are expensed during the exploration phase of a prospect and capitalised during the development  
of the project when incurred.
Purchased rights to ore reserves and mineral resources are recognised as assets at their cost of acquisition or at fair value if purchased  
as part of a business combination.
Mining concessions, when capitalised, are amortised on a straight line basis over the period of time in which benefits are expected  
to be obtained from that specific concession.
Mine development costs are capitalised as part of property, plant and equipment. Mine development activities commence once a 
feasibility study has been performed for the specific project. When an exploration prospect has entered into the advanced exploration 
phase and sufficient evidence of the probability of the existence of economically recoverable minerals has been obtained pre-operative 
expenses relating to mine preparation works are also capitalised as a mine development cost. 178
Fresnillo plc Annual Report 2016
2. Significant accounting policies continued
The initial cost of a mining property comprises its construction cost, any costs directly attributable to bringing the mining property  
into operation, the initial estimate of the provision for mine closure cost, and, for qualifying assets, borrowing costs. The Group cease  
the capitalisation of borrowing cost when the physical construction of the asset is complete and is ready for its intended use.
Revenues from metals recovered from ore mined in the mine development phase, prior to commercial production, are credited to  
mining properties and development costs. Upon commencement of production, capitalised expenditure is depreciated using the 
unit-of-production method based on the estimated economically proven and probable reserves to which they relate.
Mining properties and mine development are stated at cost, less accumulated depreciation and impairment in value, if any.
Construction in progress
Assets in the course of construction are capitalised as a separate component of property, plant and equipment. On completion, the  
cost of construction is transferred to the appropriate category of property, plant and equipment. The cost of construction in progress  
is not depreciated.
Subsequent expenditures
All subsequent expenditure on property, plant and equipment is capitalised if it meets the recognition criteria, and the carrying amount  
of those parts that are replaced, is de-recognised. All other expenditure including repairs and maintenance expenditure is recognised  
in the income statement as incurred.
Stripping costs
In a surface mine operation, it is necessary to remove overburden and other waste material in order to gain access to the ore bodies 
(stripping activity). During development and pre-production phases, the stripping activity costs are capitalised as part of the initial cost  
of development and construction of the mine (the stripping activity asset) and charged as depreciation or depletion to cost of sales,  
in the income statement, based on the mine’s units of production once commercial operations begin.
Removal of waste material normally continues throughout the life of a surface mine. At the time that saleable material begins to be 
extracted from the surface mine the activity is referred to as production stripping.
Production stripping cost is capitalised only if the following criteria is met:
• it is probable that the future economic benefits (improved access to an ore body) associated with the stripping activity will flow  
to the Group;
• the Group can identify the component of an ore body for which access has been improved; and
• the costs relating to the improved access to that component can be measured reliably.
If not all of the criteria are met, the production stripping costs are charged to the income statement as operating costs as they 
are incurred.
Stripping activity costs associated with such development activities are capitalised into existing mining development assets, as mining 
properties and development cost, within property, plant and equipment, using a measure that considers the volume of waste extracted 
compared with expected volume, for a given volume of ore production. This measure is known as ‘component stripping ratio’, which is 
revised annually in accordance with the mine plan. The amount capitalised is subsequently depreciated over the expected useful life of the 
identified component of the ore body related to the stripping activity asset, by using the units of production method. The identification of 
components and the expected useful lives of those components are evaluated annually. Depreciation is recognised as cost of sales in the 
income statement.
The capitalised stripping activity asset is carried at cost less accumulated depletion/depreciation, less impairment, if any. Cost includes  
the accumulation of costs directly incurred to perform the stripping activity that improves access to the identified component of ore, plus 
an allocation of directly attributable overhead costs. The costs associated with incidental operations are excluded from the cost of the 
stripping activity asset.
In identifying components of the ore body, the Group works closely with the mining operations personnel for each mining operation to 
analyse each of the mine plans. Generally, a component will be a subset of the total ore body and a mine may have several components 
that are identified based on the mine plan. The mine plans and therefore the identification of components can vary between mines for  
a number of reasons including but not limited to, the type of commodity, the geological characteristics of the ore body, the geographical 
location and/or financial considerations.
(f) Impairment of non-financial assets
The carrying amounts of non-financial assets are reviewed for impairment if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the  
carrying value may not be recoverable. At each reporting date, an assessment is made to determine whether there are any indications  
of impairment. If there are indicators of impairment, an exercise is undertaken to determine whether carrying values are in excess of  
their recoverable amount. Such reviews are undertaken on an asset by asset basis, except where such assets do not generate cash  
flows independent of those from other assets or groups of assets, and then the review is undertaken at the cash generating unit level.
If the carrying amount of an asset or its cash generating unit exceeds the recoverable amount, a provision is recorded to reflect the  
asset at the recoverable amount in the balance sheet. Impairment losses are recognised in the income statement.
Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements 
continued 179
Fresnillo plc Annual Report 2016
FRESNILLO TODAY STRATEGIC REPORT CORPORATE GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
2. Significant accounting policies continued
The recoverable amount of an asset
The recoverable amount of an asset is the greater of its value in use and fair value less costs of disposal. In assessing value in use, 
estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments  
of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset. Fair value is based on an estimate of the amount that the Group may  
obtain in an orderly sale transaction between market participants. For an asset that does not generate cash inflows largely independently 
of those from other assets, or groups of assets, the recoverable amount is determined for the cash generating unit to which the asset 
belongs. The Group’s cash generating units are the smallest identifiable groups of assets that generate cash inflows that are largely 
independent of the cash inflows from other assets or groups of assets.
Reversal of impairment
An assessment is made each reporting date as to whether there is any indication that previously recognised impairment losses may no 
longer exist or may have decreased. If such an indication exists, the Group makes an estimate of the recoverable amount. A previously 
recognised impairment loss is reversed only if there has been a change in estimates used to determine the asset’s recoverable amount 
since the impairment loss was recognised. If that is the case, the carrying amount of the asset is increased to the recoverable amount. 
That increased amount cannot exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined, net of depreciation, had no impairment 
loss been recognised in previous years. Such impairment loss reversal is recognised in the income statement.
(g) Financial assets and liabilities
Financial assets are recognised when the Group becomes party to contracts that give rise to them and are classified as financial assets  
at fair value through profit or loss; held to maturity investments; available-for-sale financial assets; or loans and receivables or derivatives 
designated as hedging instruments, as appropriate. The Group determines the classification of its financial assets at initial recognition  
and re-evaluates this designation at each balance sheet date. When financial assets are recognised initially, they are measured at fair value, 
plus, in the case of financial assets not at fair value through profit or loss, directly attributable transaction costs.
The Group recognises financial liabilities on its balance sheet when, and only when, it becomes a party to the contractual provisions 
of the instrument. Financial liabilities are classified at fair value through profit or loss, loans and borrowings payables or as derivatives 
designated as hedging instruments in an effective hedge, as appropriate. All financial liabilities are initially recognised at the fair value  
of the consideration received, including any transaction costs incurred.
Financial assets and liabilities at fair value through profit or loss
Financial assets and liabilities classified as held-for-trading and other assets or liabilities designated as fair value through profit or loss at 
inception are included in this category. Financial assets or liabilities are classified as held-for-trading if they are acquired or incurred for the 
purpose of selling or repurchasing in the short term. Derivatives, including separated embedded derivatives are also classified as held-for-
trading unless they are designated as effective hedging instruments as defined by IAS 39. Financial assets or liabilities at fair value through 
profit or loss are carried in the balance sheet at fair value with gains or losses arising from changes in fair value, presented as finance costs 
or finance income in the income statement.
Loans and receivables
Loans and receivables are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an active market,  
do not qualify as trading assets and have not been designated as either fair value through profit and loss or available-for-sale.
After initial measurement, such assets are subsequently carried at amortised cost using the effective interest method less any allowance 
for impairment. Gains or losses are recognised in income when the loans and receivables are derecognised or impaired, as well as through 
the amortisation process.
Current trade receivables are carried at the original invoice amount less provision made for impairment of these receivables. Non-current 
receivables are stated at amortised cost. Loans and receivables from contractors are carried at amortised cost.
Loans and borrowings
After initial recognition at fair value, net of directly attributable transaction costs, interest-bearing loans are subsequently measured at 
amortised cost using the effective interest rate (EIR) method. The EIR amortisation is included as finance costs in the income statement. 
Gains and losses are recognised in profit or loss, in the income statement, when the liabilities are derecognised as well as through the EIR 
amortisation process.
The Group adjusts the carrying amount of the financial liability to reflect actual and revised estimated cash flows. The carrying amount  
is recalculated by computing the present value of estimated future cash flows at the financial instrument’s original effective interest rate  
or, when applicable, the revised effective interest rate. Any adjustment is recognised in profit or loss as income or expense.
This category generally applies to interest-bearing loans and borrowings. For more information, refer to note 20.
Available-for-sale financial assets
Available-for-sale financial assets are those non-derivative financial assets that are designated as such or are not classified in any of the 
preceding categories and are not held to maturity investments. 180
Fresnillo plc Annual Report 2016
2. Significant accounting policies continued
Available-for-sale financial assets represent equity investments that have a quoted market price in an active market; therefore, a fair  
value can be reliably measured. After initial measurement, available-for-sale financial assets are measured at fair value with mark-to-
market unrealised gains or losses recognised as other comprehensive income in the available-for-sale reserve until the financial asset  
is de-recognised.
Financial assets classified as available-for-sale are de-recognised when they are sold, and all the risks and rewards of ownership have  
been transferred. When financial assets are sold, the accumulated fair value adjustments recognised in other comprehensive income  
are included in the income statement within other operating income or expense.
De-recognition of financial assets and liabilities
A financial asset or liability is generally de-recognised when the contract that gives rise to it is settled, sold, cancelled or expires. 
Where an existing financial liability is replaced by another from the same lender on substantially different terms, or the terms of an  
existing liability are substantially modified, such an exchange or modification is treated as a de-recognition of the original liability and  
the recognition of a new liability, such that the difference in the respective carrying amounts together with any costs or fees incurred  
are recognised in profit or loss. 
The difference between the carrying amount of a financial liability (or part of a financial liability) extinguished or transferred to another 
party and the consideration paid, including any non-cash assets transferred or liabilities assumed, is recognised in the income statement.
(h) Impairment of financial assets
The Group assesses at each balance sheet date whether there is objective evidence that a financial asset or group of financial assets 
is impaired.
Assets carried at amortised cost
If there is objective evidence that an impairment loss on loans and receivables carried at amortised cost has been incurred, the amount  
of the loss is measured as the difference between the asset’s carrying amount and the present value of estimated future cash flows 
(excluding future expected credit losses that have not been incurred) discounted at the financial asset’s original effective interest rate  
(i.e., the effective interest rate computed at initial recognition). The carrying amount of the asset is reduced through use of an allowance 
account. The amount of the loss is recognised in profit or loss.
The Group first assesses whether objective evidence of impairment exists individually for financial assets that are individually significant, 
and individually or collectively for financial assets that are not individually significant. If it is determined that no objective evidence of 
impairment exists for an individually assessed financial asset, whether significant or not, the asset is included in a group of financial assets 
with similar credit risk characteristics and that group of financial assets is collectively assessed for impairment. Assets that are individually 
assessed for impairment and for which an impairment loss is or continues to be recognised are not included in a collective assessment 
of impairment.
If, in a subsequent period, the amount of the impairment loss decreases and the decrease can be related objectively to an event occurring 
after the impairment was recognised, the previously recognised impairment loss is reversed. Any subsequent reversal of an impairment 
loss is recognised in the income statement, to the extent that the carrying value of the asset does not exceed its amortised cost at the 
reversal date.
In relation to trade receivables, a provision for impairment is made when there is objective evidence (such as the probability of insolvency 
or significant financial difficulties of the debtor) that the Group will not be able to collect all of the amounts due under the original terms 
of the invoice. The carrying amount of the receivable is reduced through use of an allowance account. Impaired receivables are de 
recognised when they are assessed as uncollectible.
Available-for-sale financial assets
If an available-for-sale asset is impaired, an amount comprising the difference between its cost (net of any principal payment and 
amortisation) and its current fair value, less any impairment loss previously recognised in the income statement, is transferred from  
equity to the income statement. In assessing whether there is an impairment, the Group considers whether a decline in fair value is  
either significant or prolonged, by considering the size of the decline in this value, the historic volatility in changes in fair value and the 
duration of the sustained decline. Reversals in respect of equity instruments classified as available-for-sale are not recognised in the 
income statement.
(i) Inventories
Finished goods and work in progress inventories are measured at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Cost is determined using  
the weighted average cost method based on cost of production which excludes borrowing costs.
For this purpose, the costs of production include:
•  personnel expenses, which include employee profit sharing, materials and contractor expenses which are directly attributable  
to the extraction and processing of ore;
•  the depreciation of property, plant and equipment used in the extraction and processing of ore; and
•  related production overheads (based on normal operating capacity).

Fresnillo plc Annual Report 2016
FRESNILLO TODAY STRATEGIC REPORT CORPORATE GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
2. Significant accounting policies continued
Operating materials and spare parts are valued at the lower of cost or net realisable value. An allowance for obsolete and slow-moving 
inventories is determined by reference to specific items of stock. A regular review is undertaken by management to determine the extent 
of such an allowance.
Net realisable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business less any further costs expected to be incurred  
to completion and disposal.
(j) Short-term investments
Where the Group invests in short-term instruments which are either not readily convertible into known amounts of cash or are subject  
to risk of changes in value that are not insignificant, these instruments are classified as short-term investments. Short-term investments 
are classified as loans and receivables.
(k) Cash and cash equivalents
For the purposes of the balance sheet, cash and cash equivalents comprise cash at bank, cash on hand and short-term deposits held with 
banks that are readily convertible into known amounts of cash and which are subject to insignificant risk of changes in value. Short-term 
deposits earn interest at the respective short-term deposit rates between one day and four months. For the purposes of the cash flow 
statement, cash and cash equivalents as defined above are shown net of outstanding bank overdrafts.
(l) Provisions
Mine closure cost
A provision for mine closure cost is made in respect of the estimated future costs of closure, restoration and for environmental 
rehabilitation costs (which include the dismantling and demolition of infrastructure, removal of residual materials and remediation of 
disturbed areas) based on a mine closure plan, in the accounting period when the related environmental disturbance occurs. The provision 
is discounted and the unwinding of the discount is included within finance costs. At the time of establishing the provision, a corresponding 
asset is capitalised where it gives rise to a future economic benefit and is depreciated over future production from the mine to which  
it relates. The provision is reviewed on an annual basis by the Group for changes in cost estimates, discount rates or life of operations. 
Changes to estimated future costs are recognised in the balance sheet by adjusting the mine closure cost liability and the related asset 
originally recognised. If, for mature mines, the revised mine assets net of mine closure cost provisions exceed the recoverable value,  
the portion of the increase is charged directly as an expense. For closed sites, changes to estimated costs are recognised immediately  
in profit or loss.
(m) Employee benefits
The Group operates the following plans:
Defined benefit pension plan
This funded plan is based on each employee’s earnings and years of service. This plan was open to all employees in Mexico until it was 
closed to new entrants on 1 July 2007. The plan is denominated in Mexican pesos. For members as at 30 June 2007, benefits were frozen 
at that date subject to indexation with reference to the Mexican National Consumer Price Index (NCPI).
The cost of providing benefits under the defined benefit plan is determined using the projected unit credit actuarial valuation method  
and prepared by an external actuarial firm as at each year-end balance sheet date. The discount rate is the yield on bonds that have 
maturity dates approximating the terms of the Group’s obligations and that are denominated in the same currency in which the benefits 
are expected to be paid. Actuarial gains or losses are recognised in OCI and permanently excluded from profit or loss.
Past service costs are recognised as an expense on a straight line basis over the average period until the benefits become vested. If the 
benefits have already vested following the introduction of, or changes to, a pension plan, the past service cost is recognised immediately.
The defined benefit asset or liability comprises the present value of the defined benefit obligation less the fair value of plan assets out of 
which the obligations are to be settled directly. The value of any asset is restricted to the present value of any economic benefits available 
in the form of refunds from the plan or reductions in the future contributions to the plan.
Net interest cost is recognised in finance cost and return on plan assets (other than amounts reflected in net interest cost) is recognised  
in OCI and permanently excluded from profit or loss.
Defined contribution pension plan
A defined contribution plan is a post-employment benefit plan under which the Group pays fixed contributions into a separate entity  
and has no legal or constructive obligation to pay further amounts. Obligations for contributions to defined contribution pension plans  
are recognised as an employee benefit expense in profit or loss when they are due. The contributions are based on the employee’s salary.
This plan started on 1 July 2007 and it is voluntary for all employees to join this scheme.
Seniority premium for voluntary separation
This unfunded plan corresponds to an additional payment over the legal seniority premium equivalent to approximately 12 days of salary 
per year for those unionised workers who have more than 15 years of service. Non-unionised employees with more than 15 years of service 
have the right to a payment equivalent to 12 days for each year of service. For both cases, the payment is based on the legal current 
minimum salary. 182
Fresnillo plc Annual Report 2016
2. Significant accounting policies continued
The cost of providing benefits for the seniority premium for voluntary separation is determined using the projected unit credit actuarial 
valuation method and prepared by an external actuarial firm as at each year-end balance sheet date. Actuarial gains or losses are 
recognised as income or expense in the period in which they occur.
Other
Benefits for death and disability are covered through insurance policies.
T ermination payments for involuntary retirement (dismissals) are charged to the income statement, when incurred.
(n) Employee profit sharing
In accordance with the Mexican legislation, companies in Mexico are subject to pay for employee profit sharing (‘PTU’) equivalent to 10% 
of the taxable income of each fiscal year.
PTU is accounted for as employee benefits and is calculated based on the services rendered by employees during the year, considering 
their most recent salaries. The liability is recognised as it accrues and is charged to the income statement. PTU, paid in each fiscal year,  
is considered deductible for income tax purposes.
(o) Leases
The determination of whether an arrangement is, or contains a lease is based on the substance of the arrangement at inception date 
including whether the fulfilment of the arrangement is dependent on the use of a specific asset or assets or the arrangement conveys  
a right to use the asset. A reassessment is made after inception of the lease only if one of the following applies:
a) there is a change in contractual terms, other than a renewal or extension of the arrangement;
b) a renewal option is exercised or extension granted, unless the term of the renewal or extension was initially included in the lease term;
c) there is a change in the determination of whether fulfilment is dependent on a specified asset; or
d) there is a substantial change to the asset.
Group as a lessee
Finance leases which transfer to the Group substantially all the risks and benefits incidental to ownership of the leased item, are capitalised 
at the inception of the lease at the fair value of the leased asset, or if lower, at the present value of the minimum lease payments. Lease 
payments are apportioned between the finance charges and reduction of the lease liability so as to achieve a constant rate of interest on 
the remaining balance of the liability. Finance charges are reflected in the income statement.
Capitalised leased assets are depreciated over the shorter of the estimated useful life of the asset and the lease term, if there is no 
reasonable certainty that the Group will obtain ownership by the end of the lease term.
Operating lease payments are recognised as an expense in the income statement on a straight line basis over the lease term.
Group as a lessor
Leases where the Group does not transfer substantially all the risks and benefits of ownership of the asset are classified as operating 
leases. Initial direct costs incurred in negotiating an operating lease are added to the carrying amount of the leased asset and 
recognised over the lease term on the same basis as rental income. Contingent rents are recognised as revenue in the period in which 
they are earned. 
Where a reassessment is made, lease accounting commences or ceases from the date when the change in circumstances gave rise  
to the reassessment for scenarios a), c) or d) and at the date of renewal or extension period for scenario b) above. 
For arrangements entered into prior to 1 January 2005, the date of inception is deemed to be 1 January 2007, in accordance with the 
transitional requirements of IFRIC 4.
(p) Revenue recognition
Revenue is recognised to the extent that it is probable that economic benefits will flow to the Group and the revenue can be reliably 
measured. Revenue is measured at the fair value of consideration received excluding discounts, rebates, and other sales taxes.
Sale of goods
Revenue is recognised in the income statement when all significant risks and rewards of ownership are transferred to the customer, usually 
when title has been passed. Revenue excludes any applicable sales taxes.
The Group recognises revenue on a provisional basis at the time concentrates, precipitates and doré bars are delivered to the customer’s 
smelter or refinery, using the Group’s best estimate of contained metal. Revenue is subject to adjustment once the analysis of the product 
samples is completed, contract conditions have been fulfilled and final settlement terms are agreed. Any subsequent adjustments to the 
initial estimate of metal content are recorded in revenue once they have been determined.
In addition, sales of concentrates and precipitates throughout each calendar month, as well as doré bars that are delivered after the 20th 
day of each month, are ‘provisionally priced’ subject to a final adjustment based on the average price for the month following the delivery 
to the customer, based on the market price at the relevant quotation point stipulated in the contract. Doré bars that are delivered in the 
first 20 days of each month are finally priced in the month of delivery.
Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements 
continued 183
Fresnillo plc Annual Report 2016
FRESNILLO TODAY STRATEGIC REPORT CORPORATE GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
2. Significant accounting policies continued
For sales of goods that are subject to provisional pricing, revenue is initially recognised when the conditions set out above have been met 
using the provisional price. The price exposure is considered to be an embedded derivative and hence separated from the sales contract. 
At each reporting date, the provisionally priced metal is revalued based on the forward selling price for the quotation period stipulated  
in the contract until the quotation period ends. The selling price of the metals can be reliably measured as these are actively traded  
on international exchanges. The revaluing of provisionally priced contracts is recorded as an adjustment to revenue.
The customer deducts treatment and refining charges before settlement. Therefore, the fair value of consideration received for the sale  
of goods is net of those charges.
The Group recognises in selling expenses a levy in respect of the Extraordinary Mining Right as sales of gold and silver are recognised. 
The Extraordinary Mining Right consists of a 0.5% rate, applicable to the owners of mining titles. The payment must be calculated over  
the total sales of all mining concessions. The payment of this mining right must be remitted no later than the last business day of March  
of the following year and can be credited against corporate income tax. 
The Group also recognises in selling expenses a discovery premium royalty equivalent to 1% of the value of the mineral extracted and sold 
during the year from certain mining titles granted by the Mexican Geological Survey (SGM) in the San Julián mine. The premium is settled 
to SGM on a quarterly basis.
Other income
Other income is recognised in the income statement when all significant risks and rewards of ownership are transferred to the customer, 
usually when title has been passed.
(q) Exploration expenses
Exploration activity involves the search for mineral resources, the determination of technical feasibility and the assessment of commercial 
viability of an identified resource.
Exploration expenses are charged to the income statement as incurred and are recorded in the following captions:
• cost of sales: costs relating to in-mine exploration, that ensure continuous extraction quality and extend mine life; and
•  e xplor a tion e xpenses:
 – costs incurred in geographical proximity to existing mines in order to replenish or increase reserves; and
 – costs incurred in regional exploration with the objective of locating new ore deposits in Mexico and Latin America and which  
are identified by project. Costs incurred are charged to the income statement until there is sufficient probability of the existence  
of economically recoverable minerals and a feasibility study has been performed for the specific project.
(r) Taxation
Current income tax
Current income tax assets and liabilities for the current and prior periods are measured at the amount expected to be recovered from  
or paid to the taxation authorities. The tax rates and tax laws used to compute the amount are those that are enacted or substantively 
enacted, at the reporting date in the country the Group operates.
Deferred income tax
Deferred income tax is provided using the liability method on temporary differences at the balance sheet date between the tax bases  
of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts for financial reporting purposes.
Deferred income tax liabilities are recognised for all taxable temporary differences, except:
•  where the deferred income tax liability arises from the initial recognition of goodwill or of an asset or liability in a transaction that  
is not a business combination and, at the time of transaction, affects neither the accounting profit nor taxable profit loss; and
•  in respect of taxable temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries, associates and interests in joint ventures,  
where the timing of the reversal of the temporary differences can be controlled and it is probable that the temporary differences  
will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
Deferred income tax assets are recognised for all deductible temporary differences, carry forward of unused tax credits and unused  
tax losses, to the extent that it is probable that taxable profit will be available against which the deductible temporary differences,  
and the carry forward of unused tax credits and unused tax losses can be utilised, except:
• where the deferred income tax asset relating to deductible temporary differences arise from the initial recognition of an asset or 
liability in a transaction that is not a business combination and, at the time of the transaction, affects neither the accounting profit  
nor taxable profit or loss; and
• in respect of deductible temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries, associates and interests in joint ventures, 
deferred income tax assets are recognised only to the extent that it is probable that the temporary differences will reverse in the 
foreseeable future and taxable profit will be available against which the temporary differences can be utilised.
The carrying amount of deferred income tax assets is reviewed at each balance sheet date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer 
probable that sufficient taxable profit will be available to allow all or part of the deferred income tax asset to be utilised. 184
Fresnillo plc Annual Report 2016
2. Significant accounting policies continued
Unrecognised deferred income tax assets are reassessed at each balance sheet date and are recognised to the extent that it has become 
probable that future taxable profit will allow the deferred tax asset to be recovered.
Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are measured at the tax rates that are expected to apply to the year when the asset is realised  
or the liability is settled, based on tax rates (and tax laws) that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
Deferred income tax relating to items recognised directly in other comprehensive income is recognised in equity and not in the 
income statement.
Deferred income tax assets and deferred income tax liabilities are offset, if a legally enforceable right exists to set off current tax assets 
against current income tax liabilities and the deferred income taxes relate to the same taxable entity and the same taxation authority.
Mining rights
The Special Mining Right is considered an income tax under IFRS and states that the owners of mining titles and concessions are subject 
to pay an annual mining right of 7.5% of the profit derived from the extractive activities. The Group recognises deferred tax assets and 
liabilities on temporary differences arising in the determination of the Special Mining Right (see note 10).
Sales tax
Expenses and assets are recognised net of the amount of sales tax, except:
•  when the sales tax incurred on a purchase of assets or services is not recoverable from the taxation authority, in which case, the sales 
tax is recognised as part of the cost of acquisition of the asset or as part of the expense item, as applicable; and
•  when receivables and payables are stated with the amount of sales tax included.
The net amount of sales tax recoverable from, or payable to, the taxation authority is included as part of receivables or payables in the 
balance sheet.
(s) Derivative financial instruments and hedging
The Group uses derivatives to reduce certain market risks derived from changes in foreign exchange and commodities price which impact 
its financial and business transactions. Hedges are designed to protect the value of expected production against the dynamic 
market conditions. 
Such derivative financial instruments are initially recognised at fair value on the date on which a derivative contract is entered into and are 
subsequently remeasured at fair value. Derivatives are carried as assets when the fair value is positive and as liabilities when the fair value 
is negative. The full fair value of a derivative is classified as non-current asset or liability if the remaining maturity of the item is more than 
12 months. 
Any gains or losses arising from changes in fair value on derivatives during the year that do not qualify for hedge accounting are taken 
directly to the income statement.
Derivatives are valued using valuation approaches and methodologies (such as Black Scholes and Net Present Value) applicable to the 
specific type of derivative instrument. The fair value of forward currency and commodity contracts is calculated by reference to current 
forward exchange rates for contracts with similar maturity profiles, European foreign exchange options are valued using the Black Scholes 
model. The Silverstream contract is valued using a Net Present Value valuation approach.
At the inception of a hedge relationship, the Group formally designates and documents the hedge relationship to which the Group  
wishes to apply hedge accounting and the risk management objective and strategy for the undertaken hedge. The documentation 
includes identification of the hedging instrument, the hedged item or transaction, the nature of the risk being hedged and how the  
entity will assess the hedging instrument’s effectiveness in offsetting the exposure to changes in the hedged item’s fair value or cash  
flows attributable to the hedged risk. Such hedges are expected to be highly effective in achieving offsetting changes in fair value or cash  
flows and are assessed on an ongoing basis to determine that they actually have been highly effective throughout the financial reporting 
periods for which they were designated.
Hedges which meet the strict criteria for hedge accounting are accounted for as follows:
Cash flow hedges
For derivatives that are designated and qualify as cash flow hedges, the effective portion of changes in the fair value of derivative 
instruments are recorded as in other comprehensive income and are transferred to the income statement when the hedged transaction 
affects profit or loss, such as when a forecast sale or purchase occurs. For gains or losses related to the hedging of foreign exchange risk 
these are included, in the line item in which the hedged costs are reflected. Where the hedged item is the cost of a non-financial asset or 
liability, the amounts recognised in other comprehensive income are transferred to the initial carrying amount of the non-financial asset  
or liability. The ineffective portion of changes in the fair value of cash flow hedges is recognised directly as finance costs, in the income 
statement of the related period.
If the hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated or exercised without replacement or rollover, or if its designation as a hedge is 
revoked, any cumulative gain or loss recognised directly in other comprehensive income from the period that the hedge was effective 
remains separately in other comprehensive income until the forecast transaction occurs, when it is recognised in the income statement. 
Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements 
continued 185
Fresnillo plc Annual Report 2016
FRESNILLO TODAY STRATEGIC REPORT CORPORATE GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
2. Significant accounting policies continued
When a forecast transaction is no longer expected to occur, the cumulative gain or loss that was reported in other comprehensive income 
is immediately transferred to the income statement.
When hedging with options, the Group designates only the intrinsic value movement of the hedging option within the hedge relationship. 
The time value of the option contracts is therefore excluded from the hedge designation. Changes in fair value of time value is recognised 
in the income statement in finance costs.
Embedded derivatives
Contracts are assessed for the existence of embedded derivatives at the date that the Group first becomes party to the contract, with 
reassessment only if there is a change to the contract that significantly modifies the cash flows. Embedded derivatives which are not 
clearly and closely related to the underlying asset, liability or transaction are separated and accounted for as stand-alone derivatives.
(t) Borrowing costs
Borrowing costs directly attributable to the acquisition, construction or production of an asset that necessarily takes 12 or more months  
to get ready for its intended use or sale (a qualifying asset) are capitalised as part of the cost of the respective asset. Borrowing costs 
consist of interest and other costs that an entity incurs in connection with the borrowing of funds.
Where funds are borrowed specifically to finance a project, the amount capitalised represents the actual borrowing costs incurred.  
Where surplus funds are available for a short term from funds borrowed specifically to finance a project, the income generated from the 
temporary investment of such amounts is also capitalised and deducted from the total capitalised borrowing cost. Where the funds used 
to finance a project form part of general borrowings, the amount capitalised is calculated using a weighted average of rates applicable  
to relevant general borrowings of the Group during the period.
All other borrowing costs are recognised in the income statement in the period in which they are incurred.
(u) Fair value measurement
The Group measures financial instruments at fair value at each balance sheet date. Fair values of financial instruments measured  
at amortised cost are disclosed in notes 30 and 31.
Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market 
participants at the measurement date. The fair value measurement is based on the presumption that the transaction to sell the asset  
or transfer the liability takes place either: 
• in the principal market for the asset or liability, or
• in the absence of a principal market, in the most advantageous market for the asset or liability.
The principal or the most advantageous market must be accessible to the Group.
The fair value of an asset or a liability is measured using the assumptions that market participants would use when pricing the asset  
or liability, assuming that market participants act in their economic best interest.
A fair value measurement of a non-financial asset takes into account a market participant’s ability to generate economic benefits  
by using the asset in its highest and best use or by selling it to another market participant that would use the asset in its highest  
and best use.
The Group uses valuation techniques that are appropriate in the circumstances and for which sufficient data are available to measure  
fair value, maximising the use of relevant observable inputs and minimising the use of unobservable inputs.
All assets and liabilities for which fair value is measured or disclosed in the financial statements are categorised within the fair value 
hierarchy, described as follows, based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement as a whole:
Level 1 — Quoted (unadjusted) market prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
Level 2 — Valuation techniques for which the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement is directly  
or indirectly observable.
Level 3 — Valuation techniques for which the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement is unobservable.
For assets and liabilities that are recognised in the financial statements on a recurring basis, the Group determines whether transfers  
have occurred between levels in the hierarchy by re-assessing categorisation (based on the lowest level input that is significant to the  
fair value measurement as a whole) at the end of each reporting period.
For the purpose of fair value disclosures, the Group has determined classes of assets and liabilities on the basis of the nature, 
characteristics and risks of the asset or liability and the level of the fair value hierarchy as explained above. Further information  
on fair values is described in note 30. 186
Fresnillo plc Annual Report 2016
2. Significant accounting policies continued
(v) Dividend distribution
Dividends payable to the Company’s shareholders are recognised as a liability when these are approved by the Company’s shareholders 
or Board as appropriate. Dividends payable to minority shareholders are recognised as a liability when these are approved by the 
Company’s subsidiaries.
3. Segment reporting
For management purposes, the Group is organised into operating segments based on producing mines.
At 31 December 2016, the Group has six reportable operating segments 
1
 as follows:
•  the Fresnillo mine, located in the state of Zacatecas, an underground silver mine;
•  the Saucito mine, located in the state of Zacatecas, an underground silver mine;
•  the Ciénega mine, located in the state of Durango, an underground gold mine; including the San Ramón satellite mine;
•  the Herradura mine, located in the state of Sonora, a surface gold mine;
•  the Soledad-Dipolos mine, located in the state of Sonora, a surface gold mine; and
•  the Noche Buena mine, located in state of Sonora, a surface gold mine.
1. Due to its size in the current year, the operations at San Julián located on the border between the states of Chihuahua and Durango, are reported within Other segments.
The operating performance and financial results for each of these mines are reviewed by management. As the Group’s chief operating 
decision maker does not review segment assets and liabilities, the Group has not disclosed this information.
Management monitors the results of its operating segments separately for the purpose of performance assessment and making decisions 
about resource allocation. Segment performance is evaluated without taking into account certain adjustments included in revenue as 
reported in the consolidated income statement, and certain costs included within Cost of sales and Gross profit which are considered  
to be outside of the control of the operating management of the mines. The table below provides a reconciliation from segment profit  
to gross profit as per the consolidated income statement. Other income and expenses included in the consolidated income statement  
are not allocated to operating segments. Transactions between reportable segments are accounted for on an arm’s length basis similar  
to transactions with third parties.
In 2016 and 2015, substantially all revenue was derived from customers based in Mexico.

1. During 2015, the Group clarified the treatment applied in the computation of the 2014 tax provision regarding the deduction of certain mining-related expenditures. This resulted  
in an adjustment of US$29.9 million to the 2015 current tax expense with an equal and opposite effect to the deferred tax expense.
2. The Special Mining Right ‘SMR’ allows the deduction of payments of mining concessions rights up to the amount of SMR payable within the same legal entity. During the fiscal year 
ended 31 December 2016, the Group credited US$12.4 million (2015: US$8.2 million) of mining concession rights against the SMR. T otal mining concessions rights paid during the 
year were US$15.4 million (2015: US$17 million) and have been recognised in the income statement within cost of sales and exploration expenses. Mining concessions rights paid in 
excess of the SMR cannot be credited to SMR in future fiscal periods, and therefore no deferred tax asset has been recognised in relation to the excess. Without regards to credits 
permitted under the SMR regime, the current special mining right charge would have been US$36.9 million (2015: US$14.6 million).

Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to offset current tax assets against current  
tax liabilities and when the deferred income tax assets and liabilities relate to the same fiscal authority.
On the basis of management’s internal forecast, a deferred tax asset has been recognised in respect of tax losses amounting to 
US$221.1 million (2015: US$295.3 million). If not unutilised, US$10.7 million will expire within five years and US$210.4 million will expire 
between six and ten years.
The Group has further tax losses and other similar attributes carried forward of US$29.1 million (2015: US$23.0 million) on which  
no deferred tax is recognised due to insufficient certainty regarding the availability of appropriate future taxable profits. 
(d) Unrecognised deferred tax on investments in subsidiaries
The Group has not recognised all of the deferred tax liability in respect of distributable reserves of its subsidiaries because it controls  
them and only part of the temporary differences are expected to reverse in the foreseeable future. The temporary differences for which  
a deferred tax liability has not been recognised aggregate to US$1,949 million (2015: US$1,449 million).
(e) Corporate Income Tax (‘Impuesto Sobre la Renta’ or ‘ISR’) and Special Mining Right (‘SMR’) 
The Group’s principal operating subsidiaries are Mexican residents for taxation purposes. The rate of current corporate income tax is 30%.
During 2016 the Mexican Internal Revenue Law granted to taxpayers a credit in respect of an excise tax (Special T ax on Production and 
Services, or IEPS for its acronym in Spanish) paid when purchasing diesel used for general machinery and certain mining vehicles. The 
credit can be applied against either the Company’s own corporate income tax or the income tax withheld from third parties. The credit  
is calculated on an entity-by-entity basis and expires one year after the purchase of the diesel. In the year ended 31 December 2016, the 
Group applied a credit of US$19.1 in respect of the year and recognised a deferred tax asset of US$4.8 in respect of the IEPS incurred in 
2016 and expected to be applied during 2017. As the IEPS deduction is itself taxable, the deferred tax asset is recognised at 70% of the 
IEPS carried forward. The net amount applied by the Group is presented in the reconciliation of the effective tax rate in note 10 (b).
The SMR is considered as income tax under IFRS, and states that the owners of mining titles and concessions are subject to pay an annual 
mining right of 7.5% of the profit derived from the extractive activities. The SMR allows as a credit the payment of mining concessions 
rights up to the amount of SMR payable The 7.5% tax apply to a base of income before interest, annual inflation adjustment, taxes paid  
on the regular activity, depreciation and amortisation, as defined by the new ISR. This SMR can be credited against the corporate income 
tax of the same fiscal year and its payment must be remitted no later than the last business day of March of the following year.

During the year ended 31 December 2016, the Group capitalised US$18.2 million of borrowing costs within construction in progress  
(2015: US$11.1). Borrowing costs were capitalised at the rate of 5.78% (2015: 5.78%).
Sensitivity analysis
As at 31 December 2016 and 2015, the carrying amount of mining assets was fully supported by the higher of value in use and fair value 
less cost of disposal (FVLCD) computation of their recoverable amount. Value in use and FVLCD was determined based on the net 
present value of the future estimated cash flows expected to be generated from the continued use of the CGUs. For both valuation 
approaches management used price assumptions of US$1,250/ounce and US$18/ounce (2015: US$1,200/ounce and US$18/ounce) for 
gold and silver, respectively. Management considers that the models supporting the carrying amounts are most sensitive to commodity 
price assumptions and have therefore performed a sensitivity analysis for those CGUs, where a reasonable possible change in prices could 
lead to impairment. As at 31 December 2016 the carrying amount of the Herradura mine is US$624.6 million, the Noche Buena mine is 
US$88.1 million (2015: Herradura mine US$654.2 million and Noche Buena mine US$118.8 million) and the San Julián mine US$559.2 which 
commenced commercial production in the third quarter of 2016.
The following table sets out the approximate expected impairment that would be recognised in 2016 and 2015 at hypothetical decreases 
in commodity prices:

In 2016 no impairment has arisen based on the investment in quoted shares. During 2015, several investments in quoted shares decreased 
below the cost paid by the Group therefore an impairment of US$2.9 million was recognised as other expenses in the income statement.
The fair value of the available-for-sale financial assets is determined by reference to published price quotations in an active market.
14. Silverstream contract
On 31 December 2007, the Group entered into an agreement with Peñoles through which it is entitled to receive the proceeds received  
by the Peñoles Group in respect of the refined silver sold from the Sabinas Mine (‘Sabinas’), a base metals mine owned and operated by 
the Peñoles Group, for an upfront payment of US$350 million. In addition, a per ounce cash payment of $2.00 in years one to five and 
$5.00 thereafter (subject to an inflationary adjustment commencing on 31 December 2013) is payable to Peñoles. The cash payment per 
ounce for the year ended 31 December 2016 was $5.15 per ounce (2015: $5.10 per ounce). Under the contract, the Group has the option  
to receive a net cash settlement from Peñoles attributable to the silver produced and sold from Sabinas, to take delivery of an equivalent 
amount of refined silver or to receive settlement in the form of both cash and silver. If, by 31 December 2032, the amount of silver 
produced by Sabinas is less than 60 million ounces, a further payment is due from Peñoles of US$1 per ounce of shortfall.
The Silverstream contract represents a derivative financial instrument which has been recorded at fair value and classified within non-
current and current assets as appropriate. Changes in the contract’s fair value, other than those represented by the realisation of the  
asset through the receipt of either cash or refined silver, are charged or credited to the income statement. In the year ended 31 December 
2016 total proceeds received in cash were US$47.5 million (2015: US$39.4 million) of which, US$2.8 million was in respect of proceeds 
receivable as at 31 December 2015 (2014: US$6.9 million). Cash received in respect of the year of US$44.8 million (2015: US$32.5 million) 
corresponds to 3.8 million ounces of payable silver (2015: 3.6 million ounces). As at 31 December 2016, a further US$5.9 million (2015: 
US$2.8 million) of cash corresponding to 538,756 ounces of silver is due (2015: 317,521 ounces).
The US$133.5 million unrealised gain recorded in the income statement (2015: US$27.7 million gain) resulted from the updating of 
assumptions used to value the Silverstream contract. The most significant of these were the increase in the Sabinas mine silver reserves 
and resources, the unwinding of the discount and the difference between the payments already received in 2016 and payments estimated 
in the valuation model as of 31 December 2015.

of the majority in the Board of Directors) the Group is obligated to repurchase the notes at an equivalent price of 101% of their nominal 
value plus the interest earned at the repurchase date, if requested to do so by any creditor.
Pledge on assets:
The Group shall not pledge or allow a pledge on any property that may have a material impact on business performance (key assets).

21. Provision for mine closure cost
The provision represents the discounted values of the estimated cost to decommission and rehabilitate the mines at the estimated date  
of depletion of mine deposits. The discount rate used in the calculation of the provision as at 31 December 2016 is in a range of 6.61%  
to 7.74% (2015: range of 4.65% to 7.13%). Uncertainties in estimating these costs include potential changes in regulatory requirements, 
decommissioning, dismantling, reclamation alternatives, timing and the discount, foreign exchange and inflation rates applied.
Mexican regulations regarding the decommissioning and rehabilitation of mines are limited and less developed in comparison to 
regulations in many other jurisdictions. It is the Group’s intention to rehabilitate the mines beyond the requirements of Mexican law, and 
estimated costs reflect this level of expense. The Group intends to fully rehabilitate the affected areas at the end of the life of the mines.
The provision is expected to become payable at the end of the production life of each mine, based on the reserves and resources, which 
ranges from 3 to 27 years from 31 December 2016 (4 to 21 years from 31 December 2015).

22. Pensions and other post-employment benefit plans
The Group has a defined contribution plan and a defined benefit plan. 
The defined contribution plan was established as from 1 July 2007 and consists of periodic contributions made by each non-unionised 
worker and contributions made by the Group to the fund matching workers’ contributions, capped at 8% of the employee’s annual salary.
The defined benefit plan provides pension benefits based on each worker’s earnings and years of services provided by personnel hired 
through 30 June 2007 as well as statutory seniority premiums for both unionised and non-unionised workers. 
The overall investment policy and strategy for the Group’s defined benefit plan is guided by the objective of achieving an investment 
return which, together with contributions, ensures that there will be sufficient assets to pay pension benefits and statutory seniority 
premiums for non-unionised workers as they fall due while also mitigating the various risks of the plan. However, the portion of the plan 
related to statutory seniority premiums for unionised workers is not funded. The investment strategies for the plan are generally managed 
under local laws and regulations. The actual asset allocation is determined by current and expected economic and market conditions and 
in consideration of specific asset class risk in the risk profile. Within this framework, the Group ensures that the trustees consider how the 
asset investment strategy correlates with the maturity profile of the plan liabilities and the respective potential impact on the funded 
status of the plan, including potential short-term liquidity requirements. 
Death and disability benefits are covered through insurance policies. 200

The sensitivity analysis above has been determined based on a method that extrapolates the impact on net defined benefit obligation as 
a result of reasonable changes in key assumptions occurring at the end of the reporting period. The pension plan is not sensitive to future 
changes in salaries other than in respect of inflation.

(b) Operating leases as lessee
The Group has financial commitments in respect of non-cancellable operating leases for land, offices and equipment. These leases  
have renewal terms at the option of the lessee with future lease payments based on market prices at the time of renewal. There are  
no restrictions placed upon the Group by entering into these leases. 
The Group has put in place several arrangements to finance mine equipment through loans and the sale of mine equipment to contractors. 
In both cases, contractors are obligated to use these assets in rendering services to the Group as part of the mining work contract, during 
the term of financing or credit, which ranges from two to six years. The Group considers that the related mining work contracts contain 
embedded operating leases.
The future minimum rental commitments under these leases are as follows:

26. Contingencies
As of 31 December 2016, the Group has the following contingencies:
• The Group is subject to various laws and regulations which, if not observed, could give rise to penalties.
• T ax periods remain open to review by the Mexican tax authorities in respect of income taxes for five years following the date of the 
filing of corporate income tax returns, during which time the authorities have the right to raise additional tax assessments including 
penalties and interest. Under certain circumstances, the reviews may cover longer periods.
 In addition, because a number of tax periods remain open to review by the tax authorities, there is a risk that transactions, and in 
particular related party transactions, that have not been challenged in the past by the authorities, may be challenged by them in  
the future, and this may result in the raising of additional tax assessments plus penalties and interest. It is not practical to determine  
the amount of any such potential claims or the likelihood of any unfavourable outcome. However, management believes that its 
interpretation of the relevant legislation is appropriate and that the Group has complied with all regulations and paid or accrued  
all taxes and withholdings that are applicable. 
 
During 2015 the Mexican tax authorities (SAT) commenced a tax audit at Minera Penmont relating to the fiscal years 2012 and 2013. 
The Group considers that it has provided all documentation required to demonstrate that all non-taxable income and tax deductions 
taken over these years are appropriate. SAT is currently evaluating the information provided by the Company. The Company has 
formally filed a writ before the Mexican T axpayers Ombudsman (PRODECON per its acronym in Spanish) in order to request a 
conclusive agreement in this matter.
• On 8 May 2008, the Company and Peñoles entered into the Separation Agreement (the ‘Separation Agreement’). This agreement relates 
to the separation of the Group and the Peñoles Group and governs certain aspects of the relationship between the Fresnillo Group and  
the Peñoles Group following the initial public offering in May 2008 (‘ Admission’). The Separation Agreement provides for cross-indemnities 
between the Company and Peñoles so that, in the case of Peñoles, it is held harmless against losses, claims and liabilities (including tax 
liabilities) properly attributable to the precious metals business of the Group and, in the case of the Company , it is held harmless by Peñoles 
against losses, claims and liabilities which are not properly attributable to the precious metals business. Save for any liability arising in 
connection with tax, the aggregate liability of either party under the indemnities shall not exceed US$250 million in aggregate.
• Peñoles has agreed to indemnify the Fresnillo Group in relation to: (i) any tax charge, subject to certain exceptions, the Company  
may incur as a result of the Pre-IPO Reorganisation (including as a result of a transaction following Admission of a member of the 
Fresnillo Group, provided that Peñoles has confirmed that the proposed transaction will not give rise to a tax charge, or as a result  
of a transaction of a member of the Peñoles Group on or after Admission), the Global Offer or Admission, and (ii) certain tax aspects  
of certain other pre-Admission transactions. Peñoles’ liability under these indemnities and in respect of general tax liabilities arising 
pre-Admission which are not properly attributable to the precious metals business of the Fresnillo Group shall not exceed US$500 
million. If a member of the Fresnillo Group forming part of Peñoles’ tax consolidation pays an intra-Group dividend in excess of its  
net income tax account (‘Cuenta de Utilidad Fiscal Neta’ o ‘CUFIN’) account after Admission and is relieved of tax as a result of the 
consolidation, it is required to pay Peñoles an amount in respect of that tax.
• On 30 November 2012, the Mexican government enacted a new federal labour law. During 2014 management implemented certain 
actions as a part of an ongoing process in order to manage the exposure resulting from the issuance of the new labour law including 
any potential impacts on the operations and financial position of the Group, however management does not expect any potential 
contingency or significant effect on the Group’s financial statements as at 31 December 2016 and going forward.

26. Contingencies continued
• In regard to the ejido El Bajío matter previously reported by the Company: 
In 2009 five members of the El Bajío agrarian community in the state of Sonora, who claimed rights over certain surface land in the 
proximity of the operations of Minera Penmont (‘Penmont’), submitted a legal claim before the Unitarian Agrarian Court (Tribunal 
Unitario Agrario) of Hermosillo, Sonora, to have Penmont vacate an area of this surface land. The land in dispute encompassed a 
portion of surface area where part of the operations of the Soledad-Dipolos mine are located. The litigation resulted in a definitive 
court order, pursuant to which Penmont was ordered to vacate 1,824 hectares of land. The disputed land was returned in July 2013, 
resulting in the suspension of operations at Soledad-Dipolos. 
 The Agrarian Magistrate noted in 2013 that certain remediation activities were necessary and requested the guidance of the Federal 
Environmental Agency (SEMARNAT) in this respect. The Agrarian Magistrate further issued a procedural order in execution of his ruling 
determining, amongst other aspects, that Penmont must remediate the lands to the state they were in before Penmont’s occupation.
 In the opinion of the Company, this procedural order was excessive since this level of remediation was not part of the original agrarian 
ruling and also because the procedural order appeared not to consider the fact that Penmont conducted its activities pursuant to valid 
mining concessions and environmental impact permits. In December 2016, the Unitarian Agrarian Court issued a subsequent procedural 
order in which the Court recognised that Penmont complied with the agrarian ruling by having returned the land in dispute and, 
furthermore, that remediation activities are to be conducted in accordance with Federal environmental guidelines and regulations, as 
supervised by the competent Federal authorities. Remediation activities in this respect are pending as the agrarian members have not 
yet permitted Penmont physical access to the lands. Penmont has already presented a conceptual mine closure and remediation plan 
before the Unitarian Agrarian Court in respect of the approximately 300 hectares where Penmont conducted mining activities. The 
agrarian community Ejido El Bajío has appealed this procedural order from December 2016 and the final result of the appeal is pending.
 In connection with the foregoing matters, and as previously reported by the Company in prior years, members of the El Bajío agrarian 
community presented a separate claim before the Unitarian Agrarian Court, alleging US$65 million in damages as well as requesting 
the cancellation of Penmont’s mining concessions and environmental permits within the El Bajío lands. In April 2016, the Unitarian 
Agrarian Court issued a final and definitive ruling on the matter rejecting the claim, which is consistent with the Company’s view,  
as previously reported, that this lawsuit had no merit.
 In addition, and as also previously reported by the Company, claimants in the El Bajío matter presented other claims against 
occupation agreements they entered into with Penmont, covering land parcels separate from the land described above. Penmont has 
no significant mining operations or specific geological interest in the affected parcels and these lands are therefore not considered 
strategic for Penmont. As previously reported, the Unitarian Agrarian Court issued rulings declaring such occupation agreements over 
those land parcels to be null and void and that Penmont must remediate such lands to the state that they were in before Penmont’s 
occupation as well as returning any minerals extracted from this area. Given that Penmont has not conducted significant mining 
operations or has specific geological interest in these land parcels, any contingency relating to such land parcels is not considered 
material by the Company. The case relating to the claims over these land parcels remains subject to finalisation.
 Various claims and counterclaims have been made between the relevant parties in the El Bajío matter. There remains significant 
uncertainty as to the finalisation and ultimate outcome of these legal proceedings.

30. Financial instruments continued
The following valuation techniques were used to estimate the fair values:
Option and forward foreign exchange contracts 
The Group enters into derivative financial instruments with various counterparties, principally financial institutions with investment  
grade credit ratings. The foreign currency forward (Level 2) contracts are measured based on observable spot exchange rates, the yield 
curves of the respective currencies as well as the currency basis spreads between the respective currencies. The foreign currency option 
contracts are valued using the Black Scholes model, the significant inputs to which include observable spot exchange rates, interest  
rates and the volatility of the currency.
Option commodity contracts
The Group enters into derivative financial instruments with various counterparties, principally financial institutions with investment grade 
credit ratings. The option commodity (Level 2) contracts are measured based on observable spot commodity prices, the yield curves of 
the respective commodity as well as the commodity basis spreads between the respective commodities. The option contracts are valued 
using the Black Scholes model, the significant inputs to which include observable spot commodities price, interest rates and the volatility 
of the commodity.
Silverstream contract
The fair value of the Silverstream contract is determined using a valuation model including unobservable inputs (Level 3). This derivative 
has a term of over 20 years and the valuation model utilises a number of inputs that are not based on observable market data due to the 
nature of these inputs and/or the duration of the contract. Inputs that have a significant effect on the recorded fair value are the volume 
of silver that will be produced and sold from the Sabinas mine over the contract life, the future price of silver, future foreign exchange  
rates between the Mexican peso and US dollar, future inflation and the discount rate used to discount future cash flows.
The estimate of the volume of silver that will be produced and sold from the Sabinas mine requires estimates of the recoverable silver 
reserves and resources, the related production profile based on the Sabinas mine plan and the expected recovery of silver from ore  
mined. The estimation of these inputs is subject to a range of operating assumptions and may change over time. Estimates of reserves 
and resources are updated annually by Peñoles, the operator and sole interest holder in the Sabinas mine and provided to the Company.  
The production profile and estimated payable silver that will be recovered from ore mined is based on the latest plan and estimates,  
also provided to the Company by Peñoles. The inputs assume no interruption in production over the life of the Silverstream contract  
and production levels which are consistent with those achieved in recent years.
Management regularly assesses a range of reasonably possible alternatives for those significant unobservable inputs described above, and 
determines their impact on the total fair value. The significant unobservable inputs are not interrelated. The fair value of the Silverstream is 
not significantly sensitive to a reasonable change in future exchange rates, however, it is to a reasonable change in future silver price, future 
inflation and the discount rate used to discount future cash flows.
For further information relating to the Silverstream contract see note 14. The sensitivity of the valuation to the inputs relating to market 
risks, being the price of silver, foreign exchange rates, inflation and the discount rate is disclosed in note 31.
Quoted investments:
Fair value of available-for-sale financial assets is derived from quoted market prices in active markets (Level 1).
Interest-bearing loans
Fair value of the Group’s interest-bearing loan, is derived from quoted market prices in active markets (Level 1).
Embedded derivatives within sales contracts:
Sales of concentrates, precipitates and doré bars are ‘provisionally priced’ and revenue is initially recognised using this provisional price 
and the Group’s best estimate of the contained metal. Revenue is subject to final price and metal content adjustments subsequent to the 
date of delivery (see note 2 (p)). This price exposure is considered to be an embedded derivative and is separated from the sales contract.
At each reporting date, the provisionally priced metal content is revalued based on the forward selling price for the quotational period 
stipulated in the relevant sales contract. The selling price of metals can be reliably measured as these metals are actively traded on 
international exchanges but the estimated metal content is a non-observable input to this valuation (Level 3).
At 31 December 2016 the fair value of embedded derivatives within sales contracts was US$(2.7) million (2015: US$(0.5) million).  
The revaluation effects of embedded derivatives arising from these sales contracts are recorded as an adjustment to revenues.
(c) Derivative financial instruments
The Group enters into certain forward and option contracts in order to manage its exposure to foreign exchange risk associated with 
costs incurred in Mexican pesos and other currencies. The Group also enters into option contracts to manage its exposure to commodity 
price risk as described in note 2 (s).

31. Financial risk management
Overview
The Group’s principal financial assets and liabilities, other than derivatives, comprise trade receivables, cash, available-for-sale financial 
assets, interest-bearing loans and trade payables.
The Group has exposure to the following risks from its use of financial instruments:
• Market risk, including foreign currency, commodity price, interest rate, inflation rate and equity price risks
• Credit risk
• Liquidity risk
This note presents information about the Group’s exposure to each of the above risks and the Group’s objectives, policies and processes 
for assessing and managing risk. Further quantitative disclosures are included throughout the financial statements.
The Board of Directors has overall responsibility for the establishment and oversight of the Group’s risk management framework.
The Group’s risk management policies are established to identify and analyse the risks faced by the Group, to set appropriate risk limits 
and controls, and to monitor risks and adherence to limits. Risk management policies and systems are reviewed regularly to reflect 
changes in market conditions and the Group’s activities. The Group, through its training and management standards and procedures,  
aims to develop a disciplined and constructive control environment in which all employees understand their roles and obligations.
The Fresnillo Audit Committee has responsibility for overseeing how management monitors compliance with the Group’s risk 
management policies and procedures and reviews the adequacy of the risk management framework in relation to the risks faced by  
the Group. The Audit Committee is assisted in its oversight role by Internal Audit, which undertakes both regular and ad hoc reviews  
of risk management controls and procedures, the results of which are reported to the Audit Committee.
(a) Market risk
Market risk is the risk that changes in market factors, such as foreign exchange rates, commodity prices or interest rates will affect the 
Group’s income or the value of its financial instruments.
The objective of market risk management is to manage and control market risk exposures within acceptable parameters, while optimising 
the return on risk.
Foreign currency risk
The Group has financial instruments that are denominated in Mexican peso, euro and Swedish krona which are exposed to foreign 
currency risk. Transactions in currencies other than the US dollar include the purchase of services, fixed assets, spare parts and the 
payment of dividends. As a result, the Group has financial assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than functional currency, 
and holds cash and cash equivalents in Mexican peso.
In order to manage the Group’s exposure to foreign currency risk on expenditure denominated in currencies other than the US dollar, the 
Group has entered into certain forward and option derivative contracts with maturity dates from 2017 (see note 30 for additional detail).
The following table demonstrates the sensitivity of financial assets and financial liabilities (excluding Silverstream) to a reasonably possible 
change in the US dollar exchange rate compared to the Mexican peso, reflecting the impact on the Group’s profit before tax and equity, 
with all other variables held constant. It is assumed that the same percentage change in exchange rates is applied to all applicable periods 
for the purposes of calculating the sensitivity with relation to derivative financial instruments.

Commodity risk
The Group has exposure to changes in metals prices (specifically silver, gold, lead and zinc) which have a significant effect on the Group’s 
results. These prices are subject to global economic conditions and industry-related cycles.
The Group uses derivative instruments to hedge against an element of gold price.
The table below reflects the aggregate sensitivity of financial assets and liabilities (excluding Silverstream) to a reasonably possible 
change in gold and silver prices, reflecting the impact on the Group’s profit before tax with all other variables held constant.

Interest rate risk
The Group is exposed to interest rate risk from the possibility that changes in interest rates will affect future cash flows or the fair values  
of its financial instruments, principally relating to the cash balances and the Silverstream contract held at the balance sheet date. Interest-
bearing loans are at a fixed rate, therefore the possibility of a change in interest rate only impacts its fair value but not its carrying amount. 
Therefore, interest-bearing loans and loans from related parties are excluded from the table below.
The following table demonstrates the sensitivity of financial assets and financial liabilities (excluding Silverstream) to a reasonably possible 
change in interest rate applied to a full year from the balance sheet date. There is no impact on the Group’s equity other than the 
equivalent change in retained earnings.

(b) Credit risk
Exposure to credit risk arises as a result of transactions in the Group’s ordinary course of business and is applicable to all financial assets 
and derivative financial instruments. The financial assets are trade and other receivables, cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments, 
the Silverstream contract and available-for-sale financial assets.
The Group’s policies are aimed at minimising losses as a result of counterparties’ failure to honour their obligations. Individual exposures 
are monitored with customers subject to credit limits to ensure that the Group’s exposure to bad debts is not significant. The Group’s 
exposure to credit risk is influenced mainly by the individual characteristics of each counter party. The Group’s financial assets are with 
counterparties with what the Group considers to have an appropriate credit rating. As disclosed in note 27, the counterparties to a 
significant proportion of these financial assets are related parties. At each balance sheet date, the Group’s financial assets were neither 
impaired nor past due, other than ‘Other receivables’ as disclosed in note 16. The Group’s policies are aimed at minimising losses from 
foreign currency hedging contracts. The Company’s foreign currency hedging contracts are entered into with large financial institutions 
with strong credit ratings.
The Group has a high concentration of trade receivables with one counterparty Met-Mex Peñoles, the Group’s primary customer throughout 
2016 and 2015. A further concentration of credit risk arises from the Silverstream contract. Both Met-Mex and the counterparty to the 
Silverstream contract are subsidiaries in the Peñoles group which currently owns 75% of the shares of the Company and is considered by 
management to be of appropriate credit rating.
The Group’s surplus funds are managed by Servicios Administrativos Fresnillo, S.A. de C. V ., which manages cash and cash equivalents, 
including short-term investments investing in a number of financial institutions. Accordingly, on an ongoing basis the Group deposits 
surplus funds with a range of financial institutions, depending on market conditions. In order to minimise exposure to credit risk, the Group 
only deposits surplus funds with financial institutions with a credit rating of MX-1 (Moody’s) and mxA-1+ (Standard and Poor’s) and above. 
As at 31 December 2016, the Group had concentrations of credit risk as 24% of surplus funds were deposited with one financial institution 
of which 47% was held in short-term Mexican government paper.
The maximum credit exposure at the reporting date of each category of financial asset above is the carrying value as detailed in the 
relevant notes. See note 13 for the maximum credit exposure to available-for-sale financial assets, note 17 for short-term investments  
and cash and cash equivalents and note 27 for related party balances with Met-Mex. The maximum credit exposure with relation  
to the Silverstream contract is the value of the derivative as at 31 December 2016, being US$467.5 million (2015: US$384.8 million). 214

(c) Liquidity risk
Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group will not be able to meet its financial obligations as they fall due.
The Group monitors its risk of a shortage of funds using projected cash flows from operations and by monitoring the maturity of both  
its financial assets and liabilities.
The table below summarises the maturity profile of the Group’s financial liabilities based on contractual undiscounted payments.

during 2017 as at 31 December 2016 and from 2016 to 2019 as at 31 December 2015, either by the Group or counterparty.
Management considers that the Group has adequate current assets and forecast cash from operations to manage liquidity risks arising 
from current liabilities and non-current liabilities.
Capital management
The primary objective of the Group’s capital management is to ensure that it maintains a strong credit rating and healthy capital ratios that 
support its business and maximise shareholder value. Management considers capital to consist of equity and certain interest-bearing loans, 
including loans from related parties, as disclosed in the balance sheet, excluding net unrealised gains or losses on revaluation of cash flow 
hedges and available-for-sale financial assets. In order to ensure an appropriate return for shareholder’s capital invested in the Group 
management thoroughly evaluates all material projects and potential acquisitions and approves them at its Executive Committee before 
submission to the Board for ultimate approval, where applicable. The Group’s dividend policy is based on the profitability of the business  
and underlying growth in earnings of the Group, as well as its capital requirements and cash flows, including cash flows from the Silverstream.

The financial statements of the Company for the year ended 31 December 2016 were authorised for issue by the Board of Directors  
of Fresnillo plc on 27 February 2017.
2. Significant accounting policies
(a) Basis of preparation and statement of compliance
The financial statements of the Company have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs)  
as adopted by the European Union as they apply to the financial statements of the Company for the years ended 31 December 2016  
and 2015, and in accordance with the provisions of the Companies Act 2006.
The financial statements of the Company have been prepared on a historical cost basis, except for certain derivative financial instruments 
and available-for-sale financial instruments which have been measured at fair value.
The financial statements are presented in dollars of the United States of America (US dollars or US$) and all monetary amounts are 
rounded to the nearest thousand (US$000) except when otherwise indicated.
The basis of preparation and accounting policies used in preparing the financial statements are set out below. These accounting policies 
have been consistently applied to all the periods presented unless otherwise stated.
(b) Changes in accounting policies
The accounting policies applied are consistent with those applied in the preparation of the separate financial statements for the year 
ended 31 December 2015.
Restatements
As at 31 December 2015, derivatives relating to the gold hedging programme initiated in 2014 that mature after one year had been 
presented as current assets. During 2016, the Company restated the prior year comparatives and reclassified these derivatives to  
non-current assets. The reclassification resulted in an increase in non-current assets and a corresponding reduction in current assets  
by US$97.5 million as at 31 December 2015, with no impact on previously reported profit, other comprehensive income, liabilities,  
equity or cash flow. In addition, there is no tax effect.
In the current year, the Company identified that a reversal of a previously recognised impairment loss on its investment in Exploraciones 
Mineras Parreña, S.A. de C. V ., amounting to US$142.9 million which existed at 31 December 2014 had not been recognised. During  
2016, the Company restated the prior year comparatives to recognise this reversal. This adjustment resulted in an increase in both 
non-current assets and equity by US$142.9 million as at 1 January 2015, with no impact in liabilities or the previously reported profit,  
other comprehensive income or cash flow for the year ended 31 December 2015. In addition, there is no tax effect.
New standards, interpretations and amendments (new standards) adopted by the Company
During 2016 there were no new standards adopted by the Company. New standards issued by the IASB effective as of 1 January 2016  
had no impact in the financial information of the Company.
Standards, interpretations and amendments issued but not yet effective
The standards and interpretations that are issued, but not yet effective, up to the date of issuance of the Company’s financial statements 
are disclosed below. The Company intends to adopt these standards that are applicable to the Company’s financial statements, when they 
become effective. 220
Fresnillo plc Annual Report 2016
2. Significant accounting policies continued
IFRS 9 Financial Instruments: In July 2014, the IASB issued the final version of IFRS 9 Financial Instruments which concludes all phases  
of the financial instruments project and replaces IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement and all previous versions  
of IFRS 9. IFRS 9 is effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2018, with early application permitted. The Company  
plans to adopt IFRS 9 Financial instruments from the mandatory effective date. The Company’s assessment of the expected major 
impacts of this standard is set out below.
Nature of change IFRS 9 addresses the classification and measurement of financial assets and financial liabilities, introduces  
new rules for hedge accounting and a new impairment model for financial assets. The derecognition rules  
are consistent with those under IAS 39.
Main impact IFRS 9 makes significant changes in the classification of financial assets. Whereas under IAS 39, the default 
classification for financial assets was available-for-sale financial assets, under IFRS 9 the residual category  
is to recognise fair value through profit or loss (FVTPL). 
Generally under IFRS 9, investments in equity instruments are recognised as FVTPL unless the Group makes an 
election, in respect of investments that are not held for trading, to measure the instruments at fair value through 
OCI (FVOCI). The Group expects to designate all investments currently recognised in available-for-sale financial 
assets as FVOCI.
In accordance with IFRS 9, this means that all movements relating to such assets are recognised in OCI. Neither 
gains nor losses on disposal or significant or prolonged declines in the value of these investments are recognised 
in profit or loss.
Impairment model
The new impairment model requires the recognition of impairment provisions based on expected credit losses 
(ECL) rather than on the basis of credit losses incurred as is the case under IAS 39. It will apply to Company’s 
financial assets classified at amortised cost and debt instruments measured at FVOCI.
IFRS 9 also sets out a simplified approach for traded and lease receivables that do not contain a significant 
financing component in accordance with IFRS 15.
Expected date of 
adoption by Company 
and considerations
The Company plans to adopt IFRS 9 effective 1 January 2018 and plans to apply the limited exemption relating  
to transition for classification and measurement and impairment, and accordingly will not restate comparative 
periods in the year of initial application.
The Company does not currently expect the impact of adopting IFRS 9 to be material to the standalone 
financial information.
IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers: IFRS 15 was issued in May 2014 and establishes a five-step model to account for 
revenue arising from contracts with customers. The new revenue standard will supersede all current revenue recognition requirements 
under IFRS. Early adoption is permitted. IFRS 15 is effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2018, with early application 
permitted. The Company plans to adopt IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers from the mandatory effective date. The 
Company has completed a preliminary assessment of the expected major impacts of this standard, the most relevant one set out below.
Nature of change IFRS 15 establishes a comprehensive framework for recognition of revenue from contracts with customers  
based on a core principle that an entity should recognise revenue representing the transfer of promised goods  
or services to customers at an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled  
in exchange for those goods or services.
Main impact As described in the accounting policies section, The Company’s revenue is derived from one revenue stream that 
corresponds to trademark royalties. The Company has evaluated recognition and measurement of revenue based 
on the five-step model in IFRS 15 and has not identified any material expected financial impacts.
IFRS 15 includes disclosure requirements to enable users of the financial statements to understand the amount, 
timing, risk and judgements related to revenue recognition and related cash flows. Certain disclosures will change 
as a result of the requirements of IFRS 15, however the Company does not expect major changes as revenue  
is derived from one revenue stream an all the transactions are carried out with related parties.
Expected date of 
adoption by Company 
and considerations
The Company plans to adopt IFRS 15 effective 1 January 2018 and to apply the simplified transition method, 
hence the cumulative effect of adoption, if any, will be recognised in retained earnings. The Company currently 
expects the cumulative effect to be nil.

IFRS 16 Leases
IFRS 16 introduces a single lessee accounting model and requires a lessee to recognise assets and liabilities for all leases with a term of 
more than 12 months, unless the underlying asset is of low value. A lessee is required to recognise a right-of-use asset representing its 
right to use the underlying leased asset and a lease liability representing its obligation to make lease payments. These amendments are 
effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2019, earlier application is permitted. However, as there are several interactions 
between IFRS 16 and IFRS 15 Revenue from contracts with customers, early application is restricted to entities that also early apply IFRS 
15. The Company is currently assessing the impact of IFRS 16 and is considering early adoption in 2018 to align with the adoption of IFRS 
9 and IFRS 15.
Amendments to IAS 7 Disclosure Initiative
The amendments require an entity to provide disclosures that enable users of financial statements to evaluate changes in liabilities arising 
from financing activities, including both changes arising from cash flows and non-cash changes. The amendments do not prescribe a 
specific format to disclose financing activities; however, an entity may fulfil the disclosure objective by providing reconciliation between 
the opening and closing balances in the statement of financial position for liabilities arising from financing activities.
The amendments apply prospectively for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2017 with earlier application permitted. Entities 
are not required to present comparative information for earlier periods. The amendments to this standard are not expected to have any 
impact in the financial information of the Company.
Amendments to IAS 12 Income T axes
The amendments to IAS 12 clarify the accounting for deferred tax where an asset is measured at fair value and that fair value is below the 
asset’s tax base. They also clarify certain other aspects of accounting for deferred tax assets. These amendments are effective for annual 
periods beginning on or after 1 January 2017 with early adoption permitted. The amendments to this standard are not expected to have 
any impact in the financial information of the Company.
IFRIC 22 Foreign currency transactions and advance consideration
IFRIC 22 provides requirements about which exchange rate to use in reporting foreign currency transactions when payment is made  
or received in advance. The interpretation requires the Company to determine a ‘date of transaction’ for the purposes of selecting an 
exchange rate to use on initial recognition of the related asset, expense or income. In case there are multiple payments or receipts in 
advance, the entity should determine a date of the transaction for each flow of advance consideration. IFRIC 22 is applicable for annual 
periods beginning on or after 1 January 2018 and earlier adoption is permitted. The interpretation is not expected to have any impact  
in the financial information of the Company.
The IASB has issued other amendments to standards, including those resulting from improvements to IFRSs that management considers 
do not have any impact on the accounting policies, financial position or performance of the Company. 
The Company has not early adopted any standard, interpretation or amendment that was issued but is not yet effective. 
(c) Significant accounting judgements, estimates and assumptions
The preparation of the Company’s financial statements in conformity with IFRS requires management to make judgements, estimates  
and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities at the date of the financial statements. 
These judgements and estimates are based on management’s knowledge of the relevant facts and circumstances, with regard to prior 
experience, but actual results may differ from the amounts included in the financial statements. Information about such judgements  
and estimates is in the accounting policies and the notes to the financial statements.
Judgements
Areas of judgement, apart from those involving estimations, that have the most significant effect on the amounts recognised in the 
financial statements are:
• Determination of functional currency (note 2 (d)):
 The determination of functional currency requires management judgement, particularly where there may be several currencies  
in which transactions are undertaken and which impact the economic environment in which the entity operates.
• Contingencies (note 13):
 By their nature, contingencies will be resolved only when one or more uncertain future events occur or fail to occur. The assessment  
of the existence and potential quantum of contingencies inherently involves the exercise of significant judgement and the use  
of estimates regarding the outcome of future events. 222
Fresnillo plc Annual Report 2016
2. Significant accounting policies continued
Estimates and assumptions
Significant areas of estimation uncertainty made by management in preparing the financial information statements include:
• Impairment of available-for-sale financial assets (note 2 (g) and 6):
 The Company classifies certain financial asset as available-for-sale and recognises movements in their fair value in equity. When the  
fair value declines, management makes an assessment of the decline in value to determine whether it is an impairment that should  
be recognised in profit or loss.
• Impairment and subsequent reversal of impairment of investments in subsidiaries (notes 2 (e) and 5):
 The Company assesses investments in subsidiaries annually to determine whether any indication of impairment exists. Where an 
indicator of impairment exists, a formal estimate of the recoverable amount is made, which is considered to be the higher of the fair 
value less costs of disposal (FVLCD) and the value in use. Due to the nature of the subsidiaries, the assessment of the recoverable 
amount is generally determined based on the net present value of future cash flows related to the subsidiaries requiring the use  
of estimates and assumptions such as long-term commodity prices, reserves and resources and the associate production profiles, 
discount rates, future capital requirements, exploration potential and operating performance. These cash flows are discounted using a 
discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset. The determination 
of that rate requires certain judgements.
 Where an impairment charge has previously been recognised, the Company assesses at the end of each reporting period whether 
there is any indication that the impairment loss may no longer exist or may have decreased. If any such indication exists, the Company 
estimates the recoverable amount of that investment, requiring similar estimates and assumptions as those for determining an 
impairment charge. At 31 December 2016 the Company reversed impairment losses of US$997.9 million (2015: US$nil) to recognise  
a cumulative impairment relating to subsidiaries of US$506.2 million (2015: US$1,537.2 million).
(d) Foreign currency translation
The Company’s financial statements are presented in US dollars, which is the functional currency of the Company. The functional currency 
for the Company is determined by the currency of the primary economic environment in which it operates.
Transactions denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the Company are translated at the exchange rate ruling  
at the date of the transaction. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are re-translated at the rate of exchange 
ruling at the balance sheet date. All differences that arise are recorded in the income statement. Non-monetary items that are measured  
in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are translated using the exchange rates as at the dates of the initial transactions. Non-
monetary items measured at fair value in a foreign currency are translated into US dollars using the exchange rate at the date when the 
fair valued is determined.
(e) Investments in subsidiaries
Subsidiaries are entities which the Company due to it being exposed to, or has the right to, variable returns from its involvement with the 
entity and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the entity. Investments in subsidiaries are recognised at acquisition 
cost less any provision for impairment. Impairment charges and reversals, up to the value of the merger reserve, are reclassified from 
retained earnings to the merger reserve.
When the Company increases its capital investment in or where there is a return of share capital from its subsidiaries, such movements  
are recognised as an addition to, or return of the original cost recognised in investment in subsidiaries.
At each reporting date, an assessment is made to determine whether there are any indicators of impairment. Where an indicator of 
impairment exists, an estimate of the recoverable amount of the investment in subsidiary is made, which is considered to be the higher  
of the fair value less costs of disposal and the value in use. The Company usually determines fair value based on the net present value  
of the future cash flows related to its subsidiaries. If the carrying amount of an investment exceeds the recoverable amount, a provision  
is recorded in the income statement to reflect the investment at the recoverable amount.
Where an impairment charge has previously been recognised, an assessment is made at the end of each reporting period whether  
there is any indication that the impairment loss may no longer exist or may have decreased. If any such indication exists, an estimate  
of the recoverable amount is made. An impairment loss is reversed to profit or loss to the extent that the increased carrying value of  
the investment in subsidiary does not exceed that that would have been determined had no impairment loss been recognised for the 
asset in prior years.

(f) Financial assets and liabilities
Financial assets are recognised when the Company becomes party to contracts that give rise to them and are classified as financial assets 
at fair value through profit or loss; loans and receivables; held to maturity investments; or available-for-sale financial assets, as appropriate. 
The Company determines the classification of its financial assets at initial recognition and re-evaluates this designation at each balance 
sheet date. When financial assets are recognised initially, they are measured at fair value, plus, in the case of financial assets not at fair 
value through profit or loss, directly attributable transaction costs.
The Company recognises financial liabilities on its balance sheet when, and only when, it becomes a party to the contractual provisions  
of the instrument. Financial liabilities are classified at fair value through profit or loss, loans and borrowings, payables or as derivatives 
designated as hedging instruments in an effective hedge, as appropriate. All financial liabilities are initially recognised at the fair value  
of the consideration received, including any transaction costs incurred.
Financial assets are offset with liabilities and the net amount is reported in the balance sheet when there is a legally enforceable right to 
set off the recognised amounts and there is an intention to settle on a net basis, or realise the asset and settle the liability simultaneously.
Financial assets and liabilities at fair value through profit or loss
Financial assets and liabilities classified as held-for-trading and other assets or liabilities designated as fair value transactions through 
profit and loss at inception are included in this category. Financial assets or liabilities are classified as held-for-trading if they are acquired 
or incurred for the purpose of selling in the short term. Derivatives are also classified as held-for-trading unless they are designated as 
hedging instruments, as defined by IAS 39. Financial assets and liabilities at fair value through profit or loss are carried in the balance sheet 
at fair value with gains or losses recognised in the income statement.
Loans and receivables
Loans and receivables are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an active market,  
do not qualify as trading assets and have not been designated as either fair value through profit and loss or available-for-sale.
After initial measurement such assets are subsequently carried at amortised cost using the effective interest method less any allowance 
for impairment. Gains and losses are recognised in income when the loans and receivables are derecognised or impaired, as well as 
through the amortisation process.
Current trade receivables are carried at the original invoice amount less provision made for impairment of these receivables. Non-current 
receivables are stated at amortised cost.
Loans and borrowings
After initial recognition, interest-bearing loans are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest rate (EIR) method. 
The EIR amortisation is included as finance costs in the income statement. Gains and losses are recognised in the income statement when 
the liabilities are derecognised as well as through the EIR amortisation process.
The Company adjusts the carrying amount of the financial liability to reflect actual and revised estimated cash flows. The carrying amount 
is recalculated by computing the present value of estimated future cash flows at the financial instrument’s original effective interest rate  
or, when applicable, the revised effective interest rate. Any adjustment is recognised in profit or loss as income or expense.
This category generally applies to interest-bearing loans. For more information refer note 11.
Available-for-sale financial assets
Available-for-sale financial assets are those non-derivative financial assets that are designated as such or are not classified in any of the 
preceding categories and are not held-to-maturity investments.
Available-for-sale financial assets represent equity investments that have a quoted market price in an active market; therefore a fair value 
can be reliably measured. After initial measurement, available-for-sale financial assets are measured at fair value with mark-to-market 
unrealised gains or losses being recognised as other comprehensive income in the available-for-sale reserve until the financial asset  
is derecognised.
Financial assets classified as available-for-sale are de-recognised when they are sold, and all the risks and rewards of ownership have  
been transferred. When financial assets are sold, the accumulated fair value adjustments recognised in equity are included in the income 
statement within other operating income or expense. 224
Fresnillo plc Annual Report 2016
2. Significant accounting policies continued
De-recognition of financial assets and liabilities
A financial asset or liability is generally de-recognised when the contract that gives rise to it is settled, sold, cancelled or expires.
Where an existing financial liability is replaced by another from the same lender on substantially different terms, or the terms of an  
existing liability are substantially modified, such an exchange or modification is treated as a de-recognition of the original liability and  
the recognition of a new liability, such that the difference in the respective carrying amounts together with any costs or fees incurred  
are recognised in profit or loss.
The difference between the carrying amount of a financial liability (or part of a financial liability) extinguished or transferred to another 
party and the consideration paid, including any non-cash assets transferred or liabilities assumed, is recognised in the income statement.
(g) Impairment of financial assets
The Company assesses at each balance sheet date whether there is objective evidence that a financial asset or group of financial assets  
is impaired.
Assets carried at amortised cost
If there is objective evidence that an impairment loss on loans and receivables carried at amortised cost has been incurred, the amount  
of the loss is measured as the difference between the asset’s carrying amount and the present value of estimated future cash flows 
(excluding future expected credit losses that have not been incurred) discounted at the financial asset’s original effective interest rate  
(i.e., the effective interest rate computed at initial recognition). The carrying amount of the asset is reduced through use of an allowance 
account. The amount of the loss is recognised in profit or loss.
The Company first assesses whether objective evidence of impairment exists individually for financial assets that are individually 
significant, and individually or collectively for financial assets that are not individually significant. If it is determined that no objective 
evidence of impairment exists for an individually assessed financial asset, whether significant or not, the asset is included in a group of 
financial assets with similar credit risk characteristics and that group of financial assets is collectively assessed for impairment. Assets that 
are individually assessed for impairment and for which an impairment loss is or continues to be recognised are not included in a collective 
assessment of impairment.
If, in a subsequent period, the amount of the impairment loss decreases and the decrease can be related objectively to an event occurring 
after the impairment was recognised, the previously recognised impairment loss is reversed. Any subsequent reversal of an impairment 
loss is recognised in the income statement, to the extent that the carrying value of the asset does not exceed its amortised cost at the 
reversal date.
In relation to trade receivables, a provision for impairment is made when there is objective evidence (such as the probability of insolvency 
or significant financial difficulties of the debtor) that the Company will not be able to collect all of the amounts due under the original 
terms of the invoice. The carrying amount of the receivable is reduced through use of an allowance account. Impaired receivables are 
derecognised when they are assessed as uncollectible.
Available-for-sale financial assets
If an available-for-sale asset is impaired, an amount comprising the difference between its cost (net of any principal payment and 
amortisation) and its current fair value, less any impairment loss previously recognised in the income statement, is transferred from  
equity to the income statement. In assessing whether there is an impairment, the Company considers whether a decline in fair value  
is either significant or prolonged by considering the size of the decline in this value, the historic volatility in changes in fair value and  
the duration of the sustained decline. Reversals in respect of equity instruments classified as available-for-sale are not recognised  
in the income statement.
(h) Cash and cash equivalents
For the purposes of the balance sheet, cash and cash equivalents comprise cash at bank, cash on hand and short-term deposits held with 
banks that are readily convertible into known amounts of cash and which are subject to insignificant risk of changes in value. Short-term 
deposits earn interest at the respective short-term deposit rates between one day and four months.
For the purposes of the cash flow statement, cash and cash equivalents as defined above are shown net of outstanding bank overdrafts.

(i) Share capital
Ordinary Shares issued by the Company are recorded at the net proceeds received, which is the fair value of the consideration received 
less costs that are incurred in connection with the share issue. The nominal par value of the shares issued is taken to the share capital 
account and any excess is recorded in the share premium account, including the costs that were incurred with the share issue.
(j) Revenue recognition
Revenue is recognised to the extent that it is probable that economic benefits will flow to the Company and the revenue can be reliably 
measured. Revenue is measured at the fair value of consideration received excluding discounts, rebates, and other sales taxes.
Trademark royalties
Trademark royalty income is recognised only at the time when it is probable that the amounts related to certain rights will be received.
Interest income
Interest income is recognised as interest accrues (using the effective interest method; i.e. the rate that exactly discounts estimated future 
cash receipts through the expected life of the financial instrument to the net carrying amount of the financial asset).
Dividend income
Dividend income is recognised when the Company’s right to receive the payment is established.
(k) Income tax
Current income tax
Current income tax assets and liabilities for the current and prior periods are measured at the amount expected to be recovered from  
or paid to the taxation authorities. The tax rates and tax laws used to compute the amount are those that are enacted or substantively 
enacted by the balance sheet date.
Deferred income tax
Deferred income tax is provided using the liability method on temporary differences at the balance sheet date between the tax bases  
of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts for financial reporting purposes.
Deferred income tax liabilities are recognised for all taxable temporary differences, except:
• where the deferred income tax liability arises from the initial recognition of goodwill or of an asset or liability in a transaction that  
is not a business combination and, at the time of transaction, affects neither the accounting profit nor taxable profit loss; and
• in respect of taxable temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries, associates and interests in joint ventures,  
where the timing of the reversal of the temporary differences can be controlled and it is probable that the temporary differences  
will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
Deferred income tax assets are recognised for all deductible temporary differences, carry forward of unused tax credits and unused tax 
losses, to the extent that it is probable that taxable profit will be available against which the deductible temporary differences, and the 
carry forward of unused tax credits and unused tax losses can be utilised except:
• where the deferred income tax asset relating to deductible temporary differences arise from the initial recognition of an asset or 
liability in a transaction that is not a business combination and, at the time of the transaction, affects neither the accounting profit  
nor taxable profit or loss; and
• in respect of deductible temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries, associates and interests in joint ventures, 
deferred income tax assets are recognised only to the extent that it is probable that the temporary differences will reverse in the 
foreseeable future and taxable profit will be available against which the temporary differences can be utilised.
The carrying amount of deferred income tax assets is reviewed at each balance sheet date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer 
probable that sufficient taxable profit will be available to allow all or part of the deferred income tax asset to be utilised.
Unrecognised deferred income tax assets are reassessed at each balance sheet date and are recognised to the extent that it has become 
probable that future taxable profit will allow the deferred tax asset to be recovered.
Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are measured at the tax rates that are expected to apply to the year when the asset is realised  
or the liability is settled, based on tax rates (and tax laws) that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
Deferred income tax relating to items recognised directly in equity is recognised in equity and not in the income statement.
Deferred income tax assets and deferred income tax liabilities are offset, if a legally enforceable right exists to set off current tax assets 
against current income tax liabilities and the deferred income taxes relate to the same taxable entity and the same taxation authority. 226

2. Significant accounting policies continued
(l) Derivative financial instruments and hedging
The Company enters into derivative contracts in order to manage certain market risks derived from changes in foreign exchange and 
commodity prices which impact the financial and business transactions of its subsidiaries. Such derivative financial instruments are  
initially recognised at fair value on the date on which a derivative contract is entered into and are subsequently re-measured at fair value. 
Derivatives are carried as assets when the fair value is positive and as liabilities when the fair value is negative.
In the Group’s consolidated financial statements certain of these derivative instruments are designated as cash flow hedges but for the 
purposes of the Company’s stand-alone financial statements the related hedged items are not held by the Company, so do not qualify  
as cash flow hedges.
Any gains and losses arising from changes in fair value on derivatives during the year that do not qualify for hedge accounting are taken 
directly to the income statement.
Derivatives are valued using valuation approaches and methodologies (such as Black Scholes and Net Present Value) applicable to the 
specific type of derivative instrument. The fair value of forward currency contracts is calculated by reference to current forward exchange 
rates for contracts with similar maturity profiles.
Embedded derivatives
Contracts are assessed for the existence of embedded derivatives at the date that the Company first becomes party to the contract,  
with reassessment only if there is a change to the contract that significantly modifies the cash flows. Embedded derivatives which are  
not clearly and closely related to the underlying asset, liability or transaction are separated and accounted for as stand-alone derivatives.
(m) Fair value measurement
The Company measures financial instruments at fair value at each balance sheet date. Fair values of financial instruments measured  
at amortised cost are disclosed in notes 17 and 18.
Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market 
participants at the measurement date. The fair value measurement is based on the presumption that the transaction to sell the asset  
or transfer the liability takes place either: 
• in the principal market for the asset or liability, or
• in the absence of a principal market, in the most advantageous market for the asset or liability.
The principal or the most advantageous market must be accessible to the Company.
The fair value of an asset or a liability is measured using the assumptions that market participants would use when pricing the asset  
or liability, assuming that market participants act in their economic best interest.
A fair value measurement of a non-financial asset takes into account a market participant’s ability to generate economic benefits by using 
the asset in its highest and best use or by selling it to another market participant that would use the asset in its highest and best use.
The Company uses valuation techniques that are appropriate in the circumstances and for which sufficient data are available to measure 
fair value, maximising the use of relevant observable inputs and minimising the use of unobservable inputs.
All assets and liabilities for which fair value is measured or disclosed in the financial statements are categorised within the fair value 
hierarchy, described as follows, based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement as a whole:
Level 1 — Quoted (unadjusted) market prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
Level 2 —  Valuation techniques for which the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement is directly  
or indirectly observable.
Level 3 — Valuation techniques for which the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement is unobservable.
For assets and liabilities that are recognised in the financial statements on a recurring basis, the Company determines whether transfers 
have occurred between levels in the hierarchy by re-assessing categorisation (based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair 
value measurement as a whole) at the end of each reporting period.
For the purpose of fair value disclosures, the Company has determined classes of assets and liabilities on the basis of the nature, 
characteristics and risks of the asset or liability and the level of the fair value hierarchy as explained above. Further information on fair 
values is described in note 17.

(n) Dividend distribution
Dividends payable to the Company’s shareholders are recognised as a liability in the financial statements in the period in which the 
dividends are approved by the Company’s shareholders.
Mexican Income T ax Law establishes a 10% tax rate on earnings from 2014 and thereafter, for dividends paid to foreign residents and 
Mexican individuals. 
Dividends paid are not subject to income tax if paid from the Net T ax Profit Account (CUFIN). Dividends paid that exceed CUFIN are 
subject to an income tax payable at a rate of 30% if paid in 2017. The tax is payable by the Company and may be credited against the 
normal income tax payable by the Company in the year in which the dividends are paid or in the following two years. Dividends paid  
from earnings previously taxed are not subject to any withholding or additional tax payment.

(c) Unrecognised deferred tax on investments in subsidiaries
The Company has not recognised all of the deferred tax liability in respect of distributable reserves of its subsidiaries because it controls 
them and only part of the temporary differences are expected to reverse in the foreseeable future. The temporary differences for which  
a deferred tax liability has not been recognised aggregate to US$1,949 million (2015: US$1,450 million).

As described in note 2 (b), the balance at 1 January 2015 has been restated.
During 2016 the Company has identified the recovery of gold and silver prices as an indicator of reversal of previously recognised 
impairment losses on its investments in subsidiaries. The Company has calculated the recoverable amount of its investments in 
subsidiaries as at 31 December 2016 and as a result has recognised a reversal of previously recognised impairment loss amounting  
to US$997,915. The recoverable amount was estimated based on the Fair Value Less Cost of Disposal (FVLCD) model (2015: FVLCD).
The following tables provide relevant information in respect of each impaired subsidiary:

Exploraciones Mineras Parreña, S.A. de C. V . – 83,705 138,628 Post-tax 6.06%
(997,915) 506,257
In determining FVLCD it is necessary to make a series of assumptions to estimate future cash flows including reserves and resources 
volumes and related production profile, price assumptions, cost estimates and discount rate. Accordingly, the fair value is categorised as 
Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy. The price assumptions used to determine FVLCD are based on analysts’ consensus of long-term prices. 
As at 31 December 2016, the Company used price assumptions of US$1,250/ounce and US$18/ounce for gold and silver, respectively.

As at 31 December 2015 management calculated the recoverable amount using FVLCD methodology. Management considers that  
the model supporting the determination of FVLCD is most sensitive to commodity price assumptions. The price assumptions used to 
determine FVLCD are based on analysts’ consensus of long-term prices. As at 31 December 2015, the Company used price assumptions  
of US$1,200/ounce and US$18/ounce for gold and silver, respectively.
Sensitivity analysis
As at 31 December 2016 Management has performed a sensitivity analysis for those subsidiaries where cumulative impairment may  
be affected by a significant decrease in silver and gold prices. Management has considered a decrease in silver of 20% and 15% for gold 
(2015: 20% and 10%, respectively). The sensitivity resulted in an additional impairment on Minera Fresnillo, S.A. de C. V . of US$622.3 million 
(2015: US$1,335.8 million) and Minera Mexicana la Ciénega, S.A. de C. V . US$85.7 million (2015; US$ nil).

Reserves
Share premium
This reserve records the consideration premium for shares issued at a value that exceeds their nominal value.
Merger reserve
The merger reserve represents the difference between the value of the net assets acquired as part of the Pre-IPO reorganisation and  
the nominal value of the shares issued pursuant to the Merger Agreement. Movements in this reserve during 2016 and 2015 represent  
the impairment losses and reversals of the carrying value of Fresnillo’s investments in subsidiaries transferred from retained earnings.
Available-for-sale financial assets reserve
This reserve records fair value changes on available-for-sale investments, net of tax. On disposal or on impairment, the cumulative 
changes in fair value are recycled to the income statement.
Retained earnings
This reserve records the accumulated results of the Company, less any distributions and dividends paid.

Senior Notes
On 13 November 2013, the Group completed its offering of an aggregate principal amount of US$800 million of 5.500% Senior Notes due 
2023 (the ‘notes’). 
An analysis of the debt recognised in the balance sheet is as follows:

The Group has the following restrictions derived from the issuance of the senior notes (the Notes):
Change of control: 
Should the rating of the senior notes be downgraded as a result of a change of control (defined as the sale or transfer of 35% or more of 
the common shares; the transfer of all or substantially all the assets of the Group; starting a dissolution or liquidation process; or the loss 
of the majority in the Board of Directors) the Group is obligated to repurchase the notes at an equivalent price of 101% of their nominal 
value plus the interest earned at the repurchase date, if requested to do so by any creditor.
Pledge on assets: 
The Group shall not pledge or allow a pledge on any property that may have a material impact on business performance (key assets). 
Nevertheless, the Group may pledge the aforementioned properties provided that the repayment of the Notes keeps the same level  
of priority as the pledge on those assets.

Fresnillo plc Annual Report 2016
13. Contingencies
As of 31 December 2016 the Company has the following contingencies:
• The Company is subject to various laws and regulations which, if not observed, could give rise to penalties.
• T ax periods remain open to review by the Mexican tax authorities in respect of income taxes for five years following the date of the 
filing of the corporate income tax return, during which time the authorities have the right to raise additional tax assessments including 
penalties and interest. Under certain circumstances the reviews may cover longer periods.
 In addition, because a number of tax periods remain open to review by the tax authorities, there is a risk that transactions, and in 
particular related party transactions that have not been challenged in the past by the authorities, may be challenged by them in  
the future, and this may result in the raising of additional tax assessments plus penalties and interest. It is not practical to determine  
the amount of any such potential claims or the likelihood of any unfavourable outcome. However, management believes that its 
interpretation of the relevant legislation is appropriate and that the Company has complied with all regulations and paid or accrued  
all taxes and withholdings that are applicable.
• On 8 May 2008, the Company and Peñoles entered into the Separation Agreement (the ‘Separation Agreement’). This agreement 
relates to the separation of the Fresnillo Group (‘the Group’) and the Peñoles Group and governs certain aspects of the relationship 
between the Fresnillo Group and the Peñoles Group following the initial public offering in May 2008 (‘Admission’). The Separation 
Agreement provides for cross-indemnities between the Company and Peñoles so that, in the case of Peñoles, it is held harmless 
against losses, claims and liabilities (including tax liabilities) properly attributable to the precious metals business of the Group and,  
in the case of the Company, it is held harmless by Peñoles against losses, claims and liabilities which are not properly attributable  
to the precious metals business. Save for any liability arising in connection with tax, the aggregate liability of either party under the 
indemnities shall not exceed US$250 million in aggregate.
• Peñoles has agreed to indemnify the Fresnillo Group in relation to: (i) any tax charge, subject to certain exceptions, the Company  
may incur as a result of the Pre-IPO Reorganisation (including as a result of a transaction following Admission of a member of the 
Fresnillo Group, provided that Peñoles has confirmed that the proposed transaction will not give rise to a tax charge, or as a result  
of a transaction of a member of the Peñoles Group on or after Admission), the Global Offer or Admission, and (ii) certain tax aspects  
of certain other pre-Admission transactions. Peñoles’ liability under these indemnities and in respect of general tax liabilities arising 
pre-Admission which are not properly attributable to the precious metals business of the Fresnillo Group shall not exceed US$500 
million. If a member of the Fresnillo Group forming part of Peñoles’ tax consolidation pays an intra-Group dividend in excess of its

• In regard to the ejido El Bajío matter previously reported by the Company:
 In 2009 five members of the El Bajío agrarian community in the state of Sonora, who claimed rights over certain surface land in the 
proximity of the operations of Minera Penmont (‘Penmont’), submitted a legal claim before the Unitarian Agrarian Court (Tribunal 
Unitario Agrario) of Hermosillo, Sonora, to have Penmont vacate an area of this surface land. The land in dispute encompassed a 
portion of surface area where part of the operations of the Soledad-Dipolos mine are located. The litigation resulted in a definitive 
court order, pursuant to which Penmont was ordered to vacate 1,824 hectares of land. The disputed land was returned in July 2013, 
resulting in the suspension of operations at Soledad-Dipolos. 
 
 The Agrarian Magistrate noted in 2013 that certain remediation activities were necessary and requested the guidance of the Federal 
Environmental Agency (SEMARNAT) in this respect. The Agrarian Magistrate further issued a procedural order in execution of his ruling 
determining, amongst other aspects, that Penmont must remediate the lands to the state they were in before Penmont’s occupation.
 In the opinion of the Company, this procedural order was excessive since this level of remediation was not part of the original agrarian 
ruling and also because the procedural order appeared not to consider the fact that Penmont conducted its activities pursuant to  
valid mining concessions and environmental impact permits. In December 2016, the Unitarian Agrarian Court issued a subsequent 
procedural order in which the Court recognised that Penmont complied with the agrarian ruling by having returned the land in dispute 
and, furthermore, that remediation activities are to be conducted in accordance with Federal environmental guidelines and regulations, 
as supervised by the competent Federal authorities. Remediation activities in this respect are pending as the agrarian members have 
not yet permitted Penmont physical access to the lands. Penmont has already presented a conceptual mine closure and remediation 
plan before the Unitarian Agrarian Court in respect of the approximately 300 hectares where Penmont conducted mining activities. The 
agrarian community Ejido El Bajío has appealed this procedural order from December 2016 and the final result of the appeal is pending. 
 In connection with the foregoing matters, and as previously reported by the Company in prior years, members of the El Bajío agrarian 
community presented a separate claim before the Unitarian Agrarian Court, alleging US$65 million in damages as well as requesting 
the cancellation of Penmont’s mining concessions and environmental permits within the El Bajío lands. In April 2016, the Unitarian 
Agrarian Court issued a final and definitive ruling on the matter rejecting the claim, which is consistent with the Company’s view,  
as previously reported, that this lawsuit had no merit.
 In addition, and as also previously reported by the Company, claimants in the El Bajío matter presented other claims against occupation 
agreements they entered into with Penmont, covering land parcels separate from the land described above. Penmont has no significant 
mining operations or specific geological interest in the affected parcels and these lands are therefore not considered strategic for 
Penmont. As previously reported, the Unitarian Agrarian Court issued rulings declaring such occupation agreements over those land 
parcels to be null and void and that Penmont must remediate such lands to the state that they were in before Penmont’s occupation  
as well as returning any minerals extracted from this area. Given that Penmont has not conducted significant mining operations or  
has specific geological interest in these land parcels, any contingency relating to such land parcels is not considered material by the 
Company. The case relating to the claims over these land parcels remains subject to finalisation.
 Various claims and counterclaims have been made between the relevant parties in the El Bajío matter. There remains significant 
uncertainty as to the finalisation and ultimate outcome of these legal proceedings.

17. Financial instruments continued
The fair value of the financial assets and liabilities is included at the amount at which the instrument could be exchanged in a current 
transaction between willing parties, other than in a forced or liquidation sale.
The following valuation techniques were used to estimate the fair values:
Options and forwards foreign exchange contracts
The Company enters into derivative financial instruments with various counterparties, principally financial institutions with investment 
grade credit ratings. The foreign currency forward (Level 2) contracts are measured based on observable spot exchange rates, the yield 
curves of the respective currencies as well as the currency basis spreads between the respective currencies. The foreign currency option 
contracts are valued using the Black Scholes model, the significant inputs to which include observable spot exchange rates, interest rates 
and the volatility of the currency.
Option commodity contracts
The Company enters into derivative financial instruments with various counterparties, principally financial institutions with investment 
grade credit ratings. The option commodity (Level 2) contracts are measured based on observable spot commodity prices, the yield 
curves of the respective commodity as well as the commodity basis spreads between the respective commodities. The option contracts 
are valued using the Black Scholes model, the significant inputs to which include observable spot commodities price, interest rates and 
the volatility of the commodity.
Quoted investments
Fair value of available-for-sale financial assets is derived from quoted market prices in active markets.
Interest-bearing loans
Fair value of the Company’s interest-bearing loan, is derived from quoted market prices in active markets.
Loans with related parties
Fair value of the Company’s loan to related party is determined using a discounted cash flow method based on market interest rates  
at each reporting date.
(c) Derivative financial instruments
The Company enters into certain forward and option contracts in order to manage its subsidiaries’ exposure to foreign exchange risk 
arising from the activities of these subsidiaries. Also the Company enters into option contracts to manage its subsidiaries’ exposure  
to commodity price risk associated with the sales of gold. In the Group’s consolidated financial statements certain of these derivatives  
are designated as cash flow hedges but for the purposes of the Company’s stand alone financial statements the related hedged items  
are not held by the Company, so do not qualify as cash flow hedges.

18. Financial risk management
Overview
The Company’s principal financial assets and liabilities, other than derivatives, are comprised of trade receivables, cash, available-for-sale 
financial assets, loans to and from related parties, interest-bearing loans and trade payables.
The Company enters into certain derivative transactions with the purpose of managing foreign exchange risk arising on the activity and 
transactions of its subsidiaries.
The Company has exposure to the following risks from its use of financial instruments:
• Market risk, including foreign currency, interest rate and equity price risks
• Credit risk
• Liquidity risk
This note presents information about the Company’s exposure to each of the above risks and the Company’s objectives, policies and 
processes for assessing and managing risk. Further quantitative disclosures are included throughout the financial statements.
The Board of Directors has overall responsibility for the establishment and oversight of the Company risk management framework.
The Company’s risk management policies have been established to identify and analyse the risks faced by the Company, to set 
appropriate risk limits and controls, and to monitor risks and adherence to limits. Risk management policies and systems are reviewed 
regularly to reflect changes in market conditions and the Company activities. The Company, through its training and management 
standards and procedures, aims to develop a disciplined and constructive control environment in which all employees understand  
their roles and obligations.
The Fresnillo Audit Committee has responsibility for overseeing how management monitors compliance with the Company risk 
management policies and procedures and reviews the adequacy of the risk management framework in relation to the risks faced by  
the Company. The Audit Committee is assisted in its oversight role by Internal Audit, which undertakes both regular and ad hoc reviews  
of risk management controls and procedures, the results of which are reported to the Audit Committee. 238
Fresnillo plc Annual Report 2016
18. Financial risk management continued
(a) Market risk
Market risk is the risk that changes in market factors, such as foreign exchange rates, or interest rates will affect the Company income  
or the value of its financial instruments.
The objective of market risk management is to manage and control market risk exposures within acceptable parameters, while optimising 
the return on risk.
Foreign currency risk
The Company is exposed to foreign currency risk on transactions and balances that are denominated in currencies other than the US 
dollar. Transactions in foreign currencies include the purchase of services, payment or receipt of dividends and other items. As a result,  
the Company has financial liabilities denominated in currencies other than functional currency, and holds cash and cash equivalents  
in Mexican peso.
The following table demonstrates the sensitivity of financial assets and financial liabilities to a reasonably possible change in the US  
dollar exchange rate compared to the Mexican peso, reflecting the impact on the Company’s profit before tax with all other variables  
held constant. It is assumed that the same percentage change in exchange rates is applied to all applicable periods. There is no impact  
on the Company’s equity other than the equivalent change in retained earnings.

Commodity risk
The Company’s subsidiaries have exposure to changes in metals prices (specifically gold, lead and zinc) which have a significant effect  
on the Company’s results. These prices are subject to global economic conditions and industry-related cycles.
The Company uses derivative instruments to hedge against precious metals commodity price exposure in its subsidiaries, see mentioned 
in note 17 (c).
The table below reflects the aggregate sensitivity relating to changes in the fair value of commodity derivative contracts of financial assets 
and liabilities, reflecting the impact on the Company’s profit before tax with all other variables held constant. There is no impact on the

Interest rate risk
The Company is exposed to interest rate risk from the possibility that changes in interest rates will affect future cash flows or the fair 
values of its financial instruments. The Company’s earnings are sensitive to changes in interest rates on any floating element of the loans 
with related parties and interest earned on cash balances. Interest-bearing loans are at a fixed rate, therefore the possibility of a change  
in interest rate only impacts its fair value but not its carrying amount. Therefore, interest-bearing loans and loans from related parties are 
excluded from the table below.
The following table demonstrates the sensitivity of all financial assets and financial liabilities to a reasonably possible change in interest 
rate applied to a full year from the balance sheet date. There is no impact on the Company’s equity other than the equivalent change  
in retained earnings.

(b) Credit risk
Exposure to credit risk arises as a result of transactions in the Company’s ordinary course of business and is applicable to all financial 
assets and derivative financial instruments. The financial assets are trade and other receivables, intercompany loans, cash and cash 
equivalents and available-for-sale financial assets.
The Company’s policies are aimed at minimising losses as a result of counterparties’ failure to honour their obligations. Individual 
exposures are monitored with customers subject to credit limits to ensure that the Company’s exposure to bad debts is not significant. 
The Company’s exposure to credit risk is influenced mainly by the individual characteristics of each counter party. The Company’s  
financial assets are with counterparties that the Company considers to have an appropriate credit rating. As disclosed in note 14,  
the counterparties to a significant proportion of these financial assets are related parties. At each balance sheet date, the Company’s 
financial assets were neither impaired nor past due. The Company’s policies are aimed at minimising losses from the foreign currency  
and commodity hedging contracts. The Company’s foreign currency and commodity derivative contracts are entered into with large 
financial institutions with strong credit ratings.
The Company’s surplus funds are managed by Servicios Administrativos Fresnillo, S.A. de C. V ., which manages cash and cash equivalents 
investing in a number of financial institutions. In order to minimise exposure to credit risk, the Company only deposits cash and cash 
equivalents with financial institutions with a credit rating of M-1 (Moody’s) and mxA-1+ (Standard and Poors) and above, and only for 
periods of less than four months.
The maximum credit exposure at the reporting date of each category of financial asset above is the carrying value as detailed in the 
relevant notes. See note 6 for the maximum credit exposure for available-for-sale investments, note 8 for cash and cash equivalents  
and note 14 for related party balances.
(c) Liquidity risk
Liquidity risk is the risk that the Company will not be able to meet its financial obligations as they fall due. The Company monitors its risk 
of a shortage of funds using projected cash flows and by monitoring the maturity of both its financial assets and liabilities.
The table below summarises the maturity profile of the Company financial liabilities based on contractual undiscounted payments.

that support its business and maximise shareholder value. Management considers capital to consist of equity and certain interest-bearing 
loans, as disclosed in the balance sheet, excluding net unrealised gains and losses on revaluation of cash flow hedges and available-for-
sale financial assets. In order to ensure an appropriate return for shareholder’s capital invested in the Company, management thoroughly 
evaluates all material projects and potential acquisitions and approves them at its Executive Committee before submission to the Board 
for ultimate approval, where applicable. The Company’s dividend policy is based on the profitability of the business and underlying 
growth in earnings of the Group, as well as its capital requirements and cash flows. 242

1. Mineral resources are reported inclusive of ore reserves. Mineral resources are not ore reserves and do not have demonstrated economic viability. All ﬁgures rounded to reﬂect the 
relative accuracy of the estimates. Gold, silver, lead and zinc assays were capped where appropriate. 
2. Mineral resources are reported at metal equivalent cut-off grades based on metal price assumptions*, variable metallurgical recovery assumptions (variable metallurgical recoveries 
as a function of grade and relative metal distribution), mining costs, processing costs, general and administrative (G&A) costs, and variable NSR factors (NSR factors include 
smelting and transportation costs). The AgEq is calculated by dividing the cost by the Ag net value factor which includes prices, recoveries, and payabilities. 
3. The cut-off grade for Ciénega’s mineral resources varies between 95 and 132 gpt AgEq. 
4. The Mega Centauro, Soledad/Dipolos, and Noche Buena resources are reported within pit shells run at a US$1,250/oz Au price.
5. The Mega Centauro, Soledad/Dipolos, Noche Buena open pit mines has produced silver at an average concentration of 0.3 gpt to 1.1 gpt. Silver is not assayed for and is not 
estimated in the resource model. Based on past production, projected in situ silver in the open pit M & I & I resource is approximately in the range of 16 to 17 Moz.
6. Mega Centauro mineral resources are reported at varied cut-offs dependent on material types and grade. Oxide material above 0.25 gpt Au reports to the heap leach, transitional 
and sulfide material above 0.30 gpt Au reports to the heap leach, oxide material above 0.82 gpt Au reports to the mill, transitional and sulfide material above 0.44 gpt Au reports  
to the mill.
7. The Soledad/Dipolos mine has been subject to legal action regarding surface access. SRK has been provided with reassurances that Fresnillo has a reasonable chance to reacquire 
surface rights to these areas.
* Metal price assumptions considered for the calculation of metal equivalent grades are: Gold (US$/oz 1,250.00), Silver (US$/oz 17.50), Lead (US$/lb 0.85) and Zinc (US$/lb 0.95)
· The resources were estimated by Fresnillo. Dr. Bart Stryhas, CPG #11034, a Qualified Person, reviewed and audited the resource calculations for Minera Penmont and San Julián. 
Matthew Hastings, M.Sc, P.Geo, MAusIMM #314693 of SRK, a Qualified Person, reviewed and audited the resource calculations for Ciénega. Benjamin Parsons, BSc, MSc Geology,

1. Mineral resources are not ore reserves and do not have demonstrated economic viability. All figures rounded to reflect the relative accuracy of the estimates. Metal assays were 
capped where appropriate. Mineral resources are reported at variable metal, metal equivalent or NSR cut-off grades and assuming reasonable metal recoveries. Orisyvo, Lucerito, 
Candameña, Rodeo and Guachichil mineral resources are reported inside a conceptual pit shell based on appropriate mining and processing costs and metal recoveries for oxide 
and sulfide material. Equivalent metal grades (and conceptual pit optimization) are based on US$1,250/US$1,400 per ounce of gold for underground or open pit projects, 
respectively, US$17.50 per ounce of silver, US$0.95 per pound of zinc and US$0.85 per pound of lead. For Pilarica, equivalent metal grades are based on US$21.00 per ounce of 
silver, US$1.14 per pound of zinc and US$1.02 per pound of lead.
2. Cut-off grade calculations assume variable metallurgical recoveries.
3. Portions of the Valdecañas deposit within the Minera Juanicipio property where Fresnillo plc holds a 56% interest. Mineral resources quoted reﬂect Fresnillo plc’s attributable 
56% ownership.

1. All ﬁgures rounded to reﬂect the relative accuracy of the estimates. Mineral reserves are reported at metal equivalent cut-off grades based on metal price assumptions*,  
variable metallurgical recovery assumptions (variable metallurgical recoveries as a function of grade and relative metal distribution), mining costs, processing costs, general and 
administrative (G&A) costs, and variable NSR factors (NSR factors include smelting and transportation costs). The AgEq is calculated by dividing the cost by the Ag net value  
factor which includes prices, recoveries, and payabilities. 
2. Reserves include planned dilution to a minimum mining width and to minable outlines.
3. The cut-off grades for the Ciénega reserve vary between 183 and 243 gpt Ag equivalent. 
4. Reserves have no additional dilution added to that inherent in the Selective Mining Unit (SMU) of 15m x 15m x 8m. Reserves are converted from resources through the process of pit 
optimisation, pit design, production schedule and supported by a Minera Penmont cash flow model.
5. Mega Centauro mineral reserves are reported at varied cut-offs dependent on material types and grade. Oxide material above 0.25 gpt Au reports to the heap leach, transitional 
and sulfide material above 0.30 gpt Au reports to the heap leach, oxide material above 0.82 gpt Au reports to the mill, transitional and sulfide material above 0.44 gpt Au reports  
to the mill.
6. The Soledad/Dipolos mine has been subject to legal action regarding surface access. SRK has been provided with documents indicating a reasonable chance that these actions  
will be settled in favour of the mine.
* Metal price assumptions considered for the calculation of metal equivalent grades are: Gold (US$/oz 1,250.00), Silver (US$/oz 17.50), Lead (US$/lb 0.85) and Zinc (US$/lb 0.95)
· Full mining recovery assumed with a factor applied for pillars where appropriate.
· The reserves are valid as of December 31, 2016. All topography is valid as of October 31, 2016.
·  For the next audit, Increased reserves are expected at Herradura-Centauro following estimated resource growth. Further work is required to estimate the growth of reserves. 
The ore reserves were estimated by Fresnillo. Bret C Swanson, BE (Min) MMSAQP #04418QP, a Qualified Person, reviewed and audited the open pit reserve calculations. Fernando 
Rodrigues, BS Mining, MBA, MMSAQP #01405, MAusIMM #304726 of SRK, a Qualified Person, reviewed and audited the underground reserve calculations. 249

Share fraud warning
Share fraud includes scams where investors are called out of the 
blue and offered shares that turn out to be worthless or non-
existent, or an inflated price for shares they own. These calls come 
from fraudsters operating in ‘boiler rooms’, mostly based abroad. 
While high profits are promised, those who buy or sell shares in 
this way usually lose their money. Most victims are experienced 
investors, losing on average £20,000.
Protect yourself
If you are offered unsolicited investment advice, discounted shares, 
inflated prices for shares you own, or free company or research 
reports, take these steps before handing over any money:
1. Get the name of the person and organisation.
2. Check the Financial Services Register at www.fca.org.uk/
register to ensure they are authorised.
3. Use the details on the Financial Services Register to contact  
the firm.
4. Call the FCA Consumer Helpline on 0800 111 6768 if there are 
no contact details on the Register or you are told they are out 
of date.
5. Search the list of unauthorised firms and individuals to avoid 
doing business with.
6. REMEMBER: if it sounds too good to be true, it probably is!
If you use an unauthorised firm to buy or sell shares, you will not 
have access to the Financial Ombudsman Service or Financial 
Services Compensation Scheme (FSCS) if things go wrong. 
Report a scam
If you are approached about a share scam you should tell the FCA 
using the form at www.fca.org.uk/scams (where you can also review 
the latest scams) or call the Consumer Helpline on 0800 111 6768. 
If you have already paid money to share fraudsters then contact 
Action Fraud on 0300 123 2040.

2 Chairman’s statement
for the year ended 31 May 2008
In the 12 months to 31 May 2008, the Company has achieved its financial targets for the year and has also met
a number of the strategic and operating milestones that the management had set themselves.
The Company started the 2008/09 financial year with a record order book; four automotive brake systems clients
that are ordering brake discs on a regular basis and improved prospects for further growth in the business. The
key achievements for the period under review were:
l Receipt of a 4 year, £300,000 to £400,000 p.a initial contract with a leading, global, brake systems group
for the supply of carbon fibre brake discs. 
l Award of a £150,000, 3 year development contract with MBDA, a world leading missile manufacturer jointly
owned by BAE Systems, EADS and Finmeccanica.
l Unit costs of ceramic brake discs are now 20% lower than levels in May 2007.
l The commencement of a development contract with a new, US based aircraft brake system supplier which
currently supplies both commercial and defence aircraft.
l Fundraising amounting to £897,000 net of expenses by the issue of new ordinary shares at 20 pence per
share as announced in July 2007. 
FINANCIAL REVIEW
In the 12 months to 31 May 2008, revenue was £508,111 (2007: £266,789). This represents a 90% increase on
the same period in 2007. Increased automotive brake disc revenues account for most of the increase and now
represents over 80% of the Company’s revenue.
At 31 May 2008, the outstanding order book was £302,124 (2007: £126,097).
Losses after taxation for the 12 months period were £594,065 (2007: £646,422). 
Earnings per share was a loss of 3.33 pence per share (2007: 4.61pence per share).
During the year the Company raised £897,000 by way of an issue of ordinary shares at 20 pence per share.
Shareholder funds at 31 May 2008 were £1,722,839 (2007: £1,413,058) and this included cash deposits of
£1,112,719 (2007: £878,971).
Capital expenditure during the year amounted to £142,599 (2007: £193,382).
The Company has no borrowings.
DEVELOPMENTS
At present, the Company is currently in advanced discussions regarding a supply contract with a leading
European supplier of braking systems to the after-market industry. A further announcement regarding this will be
made in due course.
In addition, in April 2008, the Company signed a four year supply agreement to supply carbon fibre brake discs
to a global automotive brake system supplier.
The directors believe, based on forecasts prepared by the brakes system supplier, that this contract could generate
additional revenues of approximately £300,000 to £400,000 per annum over the life of the agreement and that
the Company has sufficient manufacturing capacity to meet this demand. This agreement demonstrates that
Surface Transforms has the expertise in advanced carbon fibres and industrial fabrics which can provide a
competitive edge in composite brake technology and takes the Company’s leading-edge products into the
forefront of the international automotive performance brake market.

PEOPLE
The Board would like to thank management and staff who have all contributed to the progress the Company has
made during the year. We continue to incentivise executives with share options as we wish to align their rewards
with those of shareholders.
OUTLOOK
We envisage further progress during the coming year.
The Board believes that Surface Transforms has established itself as an industry operator with world class
technology. The commercial and development contracts which have been signed in the past year underline this
reputation.
In spite of the widely reported slowdown in world consumer and industrial markets, the Company continues to
improve its order book. The Board anticipates that the revenue growth experienced in 2007/08 will continue.

4 Chief executive’s report
for the year ended 31 May 2008
The Company has completed its first year of operations at the new Ellesmere Port site and the relocation, which
consolidated the activities of two previous sites, has delivered measurable improvements in productivity and
management team coordination.
Over the year the business has gained more stability in its revenues and over 80% of revenues derived from
automotive applications. In addition 69% of the revenue produced in the year has arisen from Continental
European markets.
The business in 2008 had 11 OEM and after market automotives clients; 3 in aircraft brake systems and 3 in
rocket components.
AUTOMOTIVE BRAKE SYSTEMS
The Company’s SystemST brake disc product is now on 28 car platforms to date and such cars are typically
priced in excess of —90,000. The main car platforms using SystemST in 2008 were:
Koenigsegg Automotive (www. Koenigsegg.sw)
SystemST brake discs are now on over 40 supercars and current production is between 24-30 cars per year.
Mov’it Gmbh (www.movit.de)
Mov’it is a leading European after market brake system supplier. Sales of SystemST have exceeded expectations
this year. On 22 September 2008 Mov’it signed a further supply agreement with the Company to purchase a
minimum of £300,000 to £400,000 brake discs per annum.
Weber Sport (www.Weber.sw)
Weber now has an established distributor network and will commence production this Autumn, targeting to
build between five and eight of the —1,000,000 price tagged supercars in the first year.
Tramontana (www. Tramontana.sp )
Tramontana, the Spanish supercar manufacturer build just 12 cars per annum and purchased six ceramic brake
car systems last year.
MM Industries Avocet 
The MMI Avocet is a newly built British sports car, launched to great interest on the ST Stand at Autosport 2008
at the NEC Birmingham in January, the 225hp Spyder version will be fitted with SystemST as standard. Final
production volume forecasts have not yet been released by MMI.
In April 2008, the Company signed a four year supply agreement to supply carbon fibre brake discs to a global
automotive brake system supplier.
The directors believe, based on forecasts prepared by the brakes system supplier, that this contract could generate
additional revenues of approximately £300,000 to £400,000 per annum over the life of the agreement, and that
the Company has sufficient manufacturing capacity to meet this demand. This agreement demonstrates that
Surface Transforms has the expertise in advanced carbon fibres and industrial fabrics which can provide a
competitive edge in composite brake technology, and takes the Company’s leading-edge products into the
forefront of the international automotive performance brake market. 
On 22 September 2008 Mov’it Gmbh, already an established customer of the Company, signed a new Supply
and Purchase contract to purchase annually, ceramic brake discs at a much higher level of volumes than had
been experienced in the previous year. The Board believes that this will amount to revenues in excess of between
£300,000 and £400,000 per annum.

AEROSPACE
Aircraft Brake Systems
Revenues from aircraft brake systems are principally from paid development contracts. Revenues in 2008 in this
area have reduced in value from the previous year. One of our clients, Dunlop Braking Systems, a subsidiary of
Meggitt plc, has now merged with a key US competitor, and the combined operations now trade under Meggitt
Aircraft Braking Systems (MABS).
MABS has been and remains a key partner of the £1.34 million, three year collaborative R&D project funded by
the UK Technology Strategy Board (formerly the DTI). This project is being led by Surface Transforms.
In recent months, development work has commenced with a second US brake system supplier that supplies both
commercial and military aircraft principally in US markets. 
Rocket Components
Surface Transforms proprietary technology is uniquely positioned to deliver high performance (in terms of
extended life time and reduced mass), affordable ceramic rocket propulsion components.
The award of a £150,000, 3 year development contract with MBDA, a world leading missile manufacturer jointly
owned by BAE Systems, EADS and Finmeccanica, recognises the potential for Surface Transform’s material
technology.
In addition, interest from other defence contractors has been shown and the Board believe progress during this
financial year will lead to further development agreements.
PRODUCTION & NEW TECHNOLOGY PROJECTS
The development of CVIST, the carbon vapour infiltration process plant has taken longer than had been
expected. Technical challenges have arisen with the process plant capabilities and this has prolonged final
commissioning. We now believe we are in the final stages of commissioning and expect production parts to be
manufactured during the second half of the current financial year.
Improved machining and finishing operations in the manufacture of brake discs has contributed to the reduction
in the unit cost of a ceramic brake disc. Cost levels currently are 20 per cent below levels of May 2007 and the
CVIST process will contribute further to lowering unit costs.
PEOPLE
The Company has a strong senior management team who have now worked together for over two years. 
This year we have taken the opportunity to appoint two new senior engineers, Geoff Whitfield BSc, MSc, and
Martin Bell BEng (Hons) MIET to the management organisation. 
The blend of skills, experience and commitment has allowed the Company to build solid foundations and the
team are well equipped to continue the good progress made to date.
We have continued to incentivise our management and staff with share options, as we wish to align their rewards
with those of shareholders.
I would like to thank all my colleagues for their dedication over the past year.

6 Directors’ report
for the year ended 31 May 2008
The directors present their annual report and the audited financial statements for the year ended 31 May 2008.
PRINCIPAL ACTIVITY
The principal activity of the Company during the year was the development and manufacture of carbon fibre
reinforced ceramic products (CFRC) for aircraft brake, automotive brake and rocket component applications. 
BUSINESS REVIEW
A review of the Company’s activities during the year is dealt with in the financial review section of the
Chairman’s statement. 
KEY RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES 
The principal risk faced by the Company is unchanged from last year and relates to the speed at which our
customers and potential customers adopt the new ceramic disc technology. Indications in the automotive area
are that the technology continues to be well received and is being adopted over an increasing number of
vehicles. This risk is constantly assessed by monitoring the level of enquiries and orders for both the Company
and industry wide.
KEY PERFORMANCE INDICATORS
The Directors continue to monitor the business internally with a number of performance indicators: order intake,
sales output, profitability and manufacturing cost of automotive discs. The Company has met its performance
targets in each of these areas as evidenced below:
l Turnover £508,111 (2007: £266,789)
l Losses after taxation £594,065 (2007: £646,422) 
l Order Book of £302,124 (as at 31 May 2008)
l Manufacturing cost of automotive discs, as at July 2008, 20% below levels of May 2007.
The Company produces an annual business plan and full monthly forecasts detailing sales, profitability and cash
flow to help monitor business performance going forward.
FUTURE DEVELOPMENTS
The Board aims to continue with its corporate strategy which is to exploit its technologies in carbon fibre
reinforced ceramics by:
l establishing contract development opportunities and collaborations with national and multi-national
customers in the aerospace and automotive industries; and 
l expanding commercial sales of CFRC products.
RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT
The majority of the Company’s staff are employed in research and development activities which are concentrated
on the ongoing development of carbon fibre reinforced ceramic friction and non-friction materials for new
products and applications.
PROPOSED DIVIDEND AND TRANSFER TO RESERVES
The loss for the year after taxation amounted to £594,065 (2007: £646,422). The directors do not recommend
the payment of a dividend.

12 Statement of directors’ responsibilities
for the year ended 31 May 2008
The directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report and the financial statements in accordance with
applicable law and regulations.
Company law requires the directors to prepare financial statements for each financial year. Under that law they
have elected to prepare the financial statements in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the EU and applicable
laws.
The financial statements are required by law to present fairly the financial position and the performance of the
Company; the Companies Act 1985 provides in relation to such financial statements that references in the
relevant part of that Act to financial statements giving a true and fair view are references to their achieving a fair
presentation. 
In preparing these financial statements, the directors are required to:
l select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently;
l make judgments and estimates that are reasonable and prudent;
l state whether they have been prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the EU; and
l prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis unless it is inappropriate to presume that the
Company will continue in business.
The directors are responsible for keeping proper accounting records that disclose with reasonable accuracy at
any time the financial position of the Company and enable them to ensure that its financial statements comply
with the Companies Act 1985. They have general responsibility for taking such steps as are reasonably open to
them to safeguard the assets of the Company and to prevent and detect fraud and other irregularities.
The directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity of the corporate and financial information
included on the Company’s website. Legislation in the UK governing the preparation and dissemination of
financial statements may differ from legislation in other jurisdictions.

13 Independent auditors’ report 
to the members of Surface Transforms plc
We have audited the financial statements of Surface Transforms plc for the year ended 31 May 2008 which comprise
the Income Statement, the Statement of Changes in Equity, the Balance Sheet, the Cash Flow Statement and the related
notes. These financial statements have been prepared under the accounting policies set out therein. 
This report is made solely to the Company’s members, as a body, in accordance with section 235 of the Companies
Act 1985. Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might state to the Company’s members those matters we
are required to state to them in an auditor’s report and for no other purpose. To the fullest extent permitted by law, we
do not accept or assume responsibility to anyone other than the Company and the Company’s members as a body, for
our audit work, for this report, or for the opinions we have formed.
RESPECTIVE RESPONSIBILITIES OF DIRECTORS AND AUDITORS
The directors’ responsibilities for preparing the Annual Report, and the financial statements in accordance with
applicable law and International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the EU are set out in the
Statement of Directors’ Responsibilities on page 13.
Our responsibility is to audit the financial statements in accordance with relevant legal and regulatory requirements
and International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland).
We report to you our opinion as to whether the financial statements give a true and fair view and whether the financial
statements have been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 1985. We also report to you whether
in our opinion the information given in the Directors’ Report is consistent with the financial statements. The
information given in the Directors’ Report includes that specific information presented in the Chairman’s Statement
that is cross referred from the Business Review section of the Directors’ Report.
In addition we report to you if, in our opinion, the Company has not kept proper accounting records, if we have not
received all the information and explanations we require for our audit, or if information specified by law regarding
directors’ remuneration and other transactions is not disclosed. 
We read the other information contained in the Annual Report and consider whether it is consistent with the audited
financial statements. We consider the implications for our report if we become aware of any apparent misstatements
or material inconsistencies with the financial statements. Our responsibilities do not extend to any other information.
BASIS OF AUDIT OPINION
We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland) issued by the
Auditing Practices Board. An audit includes examination, on a test basis, of evidence relevant to the amounts and
disclosures in the financial statements. It also includes an assessment of the significant estimates and judgments made

18 Notes to the financial statements
for the year ended 31 May 2008
1 ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Surface Transforms plc (the “Company”) is a Company incorporated and domiciled in the UK.
Statement of compliance
The financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting
Standards (‘IFRSs’) as adopted by the EU.
Basis of preparation
The financial statements have been prepared in accordance with applicable accounting standards and
under the historical cost accounting rules, modified to include revaluation to fair value of certain financial
instruments described below. 
The accounting policies set out below have, unless otherwise stated, been applied consistently to all
periods presented in these financial statements and in preparing an opening IFRS balance sheet at 1 June
2006 for the purposes of the transition to Adopted IFRSs. 
Going concern
The financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis which the directors believe to be
appropriate. The Company incurred a net loss of £594,065 during the year however the directors are
satisfied, based on detailed cash flow projections, that sufficient cash is available to meet the Company’s
needs as they fall due for at least 12 months from the date of signing the accounts. In addition revenues are
expected to continue to increase in the coming years resulting in the Company becoming profitable in due
course.
Transition to Adopted IFRSs
The Company is preparing its financial statements in accordance with Adopted IFRS for the first time and
consequently has applied IFRS 1. An explanation of how the transition to Adopted IFRSs has affected the
reported financial position, financial performance and cash flows of the Company is provided in note 24.
IFRS 1 grants certain exemptions from the full requirements of Adopted IFRSs in the transition period. The
following exemptions have been taken in these financial statements:
Share based payments – IFRS 2 is being applied to equity instruments that were granted after 7 November
2002 and that had not vested by 1 June 2006.
Share based payments
The share option programme allows employees to acquire shares of the Company. The fair value is
measured at grant date and spread over the period during which the employees become unconditionally
entitled to the options. The fair value of the options granted is measured using an option pricing model,
taking into account the terms and conditions upon which the options were granted. The amount recognised
as an expense is adjusted to reflect the actual number of share options that vest except where forfeiture is
only due to share prices not achieving the threshold for vesting.
Intangible assets and amortisation
Expenditure on patents is capitalised and amortised to nil by equal annual instalments over the useful
economic life of seven and a half years.
Property, plant and equipment
Depreciation is provided to write off the cost less the estimated residual value of property, plant and
equipment by equal instalments over their estimated useful economic lives as follows:
Plant and machinery – 12.5%-20% per annum
Fixtures and fittings – 25% per annum
Motor vehicles – 25% per annum
Leasehold Improvements – Over life of lease.

1 ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued)
Foreign currencies
Transactions in foreign currencies are recorded using the rate of exchange ruling at the date of the
transaction. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated to the
functional currency at the foreign exchange rate ruling at the balance sheet date and the gains or losses on
translation are included in the income statement.
Leases
Operating lease rentals are charged to the profit and loss account on a straight line basis over the period of
the lease.
Government grants
Revenue grants are credited to the profit and loss account, and included within other operating income, so
as to match them with expenditure to which they relate.
Post retirement benefits
The Company does not operate a pension scheme, but does contribute to specific employees’ personal
pension schemes. The amount charged to the profit and loss account represents the contributions payable
to employees personal pension schemes during the accounting year.
Research and development expenditure
Expenditure on research activities is recognised in the income statement as an expense as incurred.
Expenditure on development activities is capitalised if the product or process is technically and
commercially feasible and the Company intends and has the technical ability and sufficient resources to
complete development, future economic benefits are probable and if the Company can measure reliably
the expenditure attributable to the intangible asset during its development. No research costs met the
criteria for capitalisation in the current or preceding years.
Inventories 
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value. In determining the cost of raw materials
and consumables the purchase price is used. For work in progress, cost is taken as production cost, which
includes an appropriate proportion of attributable overheads.
Taxation
The charge for taxation is based on the loss for the year and takes into account taxation deferred or
accelerated arising from temporary differences between the carrying amounts of certain items for taxation
and for accounting purposes. 
Deferred taxation is provided for in full at the tax rate which is expected to apply to the period when the
deferred taxation is expected to be realised, including on tax losses carried forward. 
Deferred taxation assets are recognised only to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will
be available against which the temporary differences can be utilised. 
Research and development tax credits are recognised on a cash received basis as a reduction in the current
tax payable as this is when the tax credit is considered recoverable.
Cash and cash equivalents 
Cash and cash equivalents, for the purpose of the cash flow statement, comprises cash in hand and deposits
repayable on demand.

New standards and interpretations that have been endorsed, but which are not yet effective and not early
adopted
A number of new standards, amendments to standards and interpretations are not yet effective for the year
ended 31 May 2008, and have not been applied in preparing these financial statements:
IFRS 8 ‘Operating Segments’ introduces the “management approach” to segment reporting. IFRS 8, which
becomes mandatory for the Company’s 2010 financial statements, will require the disclosure of segment
information based on the internal reports regularly reviewed by the Company’s Chief Operating Decision
Maker in order to assess each segment’s performance and to allocate resources to them. Currently the
Company presents primary segment information in respect of its business segments (see Note 2).
New standards and interpretations that have not yet been endorsed
Amendment to IAS 1 ‘Presentation of Financial Statements: A Revised Presentation’. If endorsed by the EU
this will be applicable to the Company’s 2010 financial statements.
Amendment to IFRS 2 ‘Share Based Payment: Vesting Conditions and Cancellations’. If endorsed by the EU
this will be applicable to the Company’s 2010 financial statements.
Revised IAS 23 ‘Borrowing Costs’ removes the option to expense borrowing costs and requires that an entity
capitalise borrowing costs directly attributable to the acquisition, construction or production of a qualifying
asset as part of the cost of that asset. If endorsed the revised IAS 23 will become mandatory for the
Company’s 2010 financial statements and will constitute a change in accounting policy for the Company.
In accordance with the transitional provisions the Company will apply the revised IAS 23 to qualifying
assets for which capitalisation of borrowing costs commences on or after the effective date.
Amendment to IAS 32 and IAS 1 ‘Puttable Financial Instruments and Obligations Existing on Liquidation’.
If endorsed by the EU this will be applicable to the Company’s 2010 financial statements.
Revenue
Revenue comprises income derived from research the supply of carbon fibre structures and carbon fibre
reinforced ceramic products. Revenue is recognised on transfer to the customer of significant risks and
rewards of ownership, generally this will be when goods are despatched to the customer. Turnover excludes
value added taxes.
Non-derivative financial instruments
Non-derivative financial instruments comprise investments in equity and debt securities, trade and other
receivables, cash and cash equivalents, loans and borrowings, and trade and other payables.
Trade and other receivables
Trade and other receivables are recognised initially at fair value. Subsequent to initial recognition they are
measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method, less any impairment losses.
Trade and other payables
Trade and other payables are recognised initially at fair value. Subsequent to initial recognition they are
measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method.
Interest rate risk
The Company finances its operations through cash. Cash resources are invested to attract the highest rates
for periods that do not limit access to these resources.
Liquidity risk
With regard to liquidity, the Company’s policy has throughout the year been to ensure that the Company is
able at all times to meet its financial liabilities as and when they fall due.

1 ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued)
Critical accounting estimates
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with adopted IFRSs requires management to make
judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the application of policies and reported amounts of
assets and liabilities, income and expenses. The estimates and associated assumptions are based on
historical experience and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances,
the results of which form the basis of making the judgements about carrying values of assets and liabilities
that are not already apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates. The
estimates and assumptions which have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to carrying
amount of assets and liabilities within the next financial year are discussed below:
Impairment of property, plant and equipment
Property, plant and equipment are reviewed for impairment if events or changes in circumstances indicate
that the carrying amount of an asset is not recoverable. 
Provision to write inventories down to net realisable value
The Company makes provisions for obsolescence based on historical experiences and management
estimates of future events. Actual outcome could vary significantly from these estimates.
2 ANALYSIS OF TURNOVER AND LOSS ON ORDINARY ACTIVITIES BEFORE TAXATION
Revenue and loss on ordinary activities before taxation is wholly attributable to the principal activity of the
Company.
Primary reporting format – business segments
Revenue by business segment is analysed as follows:
2008 2007
££
Automotive 424,413216,065

All business segments are serviced by a single production facility. As such, net assets, liabilities, additions
to property, plant and equipment, loss before tax and depreciation cannot be attributed to specific business
segments.
Secondary reporting format – Geographical segments
Revenue by destination is analysed as follows:
2008 2007
££
By geographical market: 
United Kingdom 138,074 93,270

2008.
Factors that may affect future tax charges 
The effective tax rate in future years is expected to be below the standard rate of corporation tax in the UK
due principally to historical losses which have been carried forward.

relating principally to tax losses which the Company can offset against future taxable profits from the same
trade.
The deferred tax asset has not been recognised in the accounts because it is not possible to assess whether
there will be suitable taxable profits from which the future reversal of the underlying temporary differences
can be deducted.

19 LOSS ON ORDINARY SHARES
The calculation of basic loss per ordinary share is based on the loss for the financial year divided by the
weighted average number of shares in issue during the year.
Losses and number of shares used in the calculations of loss per ordinary share are set out below:
Basic
2008 2007
££
Loss after tax (594,065) (646,422)
Weighted average number of shares 17,828,562 14,030,748
Loss per share (3.33p) (4.61p)
The calculation of diluted loss per ordinary share is identical to that used for the basic loss per ordinary
share. This is because the exercise of options would have the effect of reducing the loss per ordinary share
from continuing operations and is therefore not dilutive under the terms of IAS33.

22 SHARE BASED PAYMENTS (continued)
Included within the EMI share options balance are options over 205,107 (2007: 205,107) shares that have
not been recognised in accordance with IFRS2 because either they were granted on or before 7 November
2002 or that they had vested prior to the effective date on 1 June 2006. These options have not been
subsequently modified and therefore do not need to be accounted for in accordance with IFRS 2.
There were no share options exercised during the year (2007: nil).
A charge of £56,609 (2007: £62,375) has been made in the profit and loss account to spread the fair value
of the options over the 3 year service obligations of those incentives.
Assumptions used in the valuation of share based options
In calculating the fair value of the share based payment arrangements the Company has used the Black
Scholes method. The fair value of the share options granted in 2007 and the assumptions used of their fair
value on the date of grant were as follows:
Weighted Average Assumptions 2008 2007
Fair Value per share option N/a* 15.9p
Share price on date of grant N/a* 20p
Exercise Price N/a* 21p
Share options granted in the year EMI N/a* 334,125
Share options granted in the year Unapproved N/a* 110,875
Expected Volatility N/a* 100%
Exercise Pattern (years) N/a* 3-10 years uniformly
Expected dividend yields N/a* 0%
Risk free rate of return N/a* 4.50%
*No share options were granted in the year to 31 May 2008
The fair value of the share options is applied to the number of options that are expected to vest which takes
into account the expected and actual forfeitures over the vesting period as a result of cessation of
employment.
Expected volatility was determined by assessing the Company’s historic data and the market the Company
operates in.
23 CAPITAL MANAGEMENT
The Board’s policy is to maintain a strong capital base so as to maintain investor, creditor and market
confidence and to sustain future development of the business. The Board of directors monitors the return
on capital, defined as net operating income divided by total shareholders’ equity.
At present employees and directors hold 21% of the share capital, assuming all outstanding share options
are exercised.
Shares issued in the year totalled £897,237. There were no changes in the Company’s approach to capital
management in the year.
24 IFRS RESTATEMENT INFORMATION
The Company’s financial statements for the year ended 31 May 2008 are the Company’s first annual
statements in compliance with adopted IFRSs. 
There are no material differences between the figures previously presented under UK GAAP and their
restatement to adopted IFRSs.

Notes:
1 A person entitled to attend and vote at this meeting is entitled to appoint one or more proxies to attend and, on a poll,
vote in his/her stead. A proxy need not be a member of the Company. Appointment of proxies does not preclude
members from attending and voting at the meeting should they wish to do so.
2 To be valid, the instrument appointing a proxy must be deposited at the office of the Company’s registrars, Capita
Registrars, Proxy Department, The Registry, 34 Beckenham Street, Beckenham, Kent BR3 4TU not less than 48 hours
before the time of the meeting.
3 Copies of the Directors’ contracts of service with the Company will be available for inspection during normal business
hours on any week day at the registered office of the Company from the date of this notice until the annual general
meeting and on the day of the annual general meeting at the place of the meeting from 15 minutes prior to its
commencement until its conclusion.
4 As permitted by Regulation 41 of the Uncertificated Securities Regulations 2001, the Company specifies that only those
shareholders of the Company on the register at close of business on 26 October 2008 shall be entitled to attend or vote
at the meeting in respect of the number of shares registered in their name at the time. Changes to the register of
members after 26 October 2008 shall be disregarded in determining the rights of any person to attend or vote at the
meeting.
5 CREST members who wish to appoint a proxy or proxies by utilising the CREST electronic proxy appointment service
may do so by utilising the procedures described in the CREST Manual. CREST Personal Members or other CREST
sponsored members, and those CREST members who have appointed a voting service provider(s), should refer to their
CREST sponsor or voting service provider(s), who will be able to take the appropriate action on their behalf.
In order for a proxy appointment made by means of CREST to be valid, the appropriate CREST message must be
transmitted so as to be received by the Company’s agent, Capita Registrars (whose CREST ID is RA10) by the specified
latest time(s) for receipt of proxy appointments. For this purpose, the time of receipt will be taken to be the time (as
determined by the timestamp applied to the message by the CREST Applications Host) from which the Company’s agent
is able to retrieve the message by enquiry to CREST in the manner prescribed.
The Company may treat as invalid a CREST Proxy Instruction in the circumstances set out in Regulation 35(5)(a) of the
Uncertificated Securities Regulations 2001.

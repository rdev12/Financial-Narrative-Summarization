station contract
The redevelopment of London Bridge 
station is a key part of the Thameslink 
Programme, which aims to increase 
significantly the total frequency of trains 
through the station per hour. Work 
is due to commence in full in 2013 and

to be joining Costain. Costain rightly 
has an outstanding reputation for 
applying technological expertise and 
innovation to add value to customers. 
Allied with Promanex’s proven 
capabilities and market leading 
position in our core sectors, 
we will make a formidable team. 
“Costain has an exciting future and 
we are very much looking forward 
to being a part of it.”

CEEQUAL awards
In 2011, we received the CEEQUAL 
(‘Civil Engineering Environmental 
Quality Assessment and Award 
Scheme’) ‘Outstanding Achievement’ 
Award in the community relations 
category for the Castleford Footbridge 
project and an ‘Excellent’ Award for 
the Church Village Bypass project.
The Prince’s Seeing is Believing 
programme aims to inspire and engage 
business leaders on responsibility 
issues. Through unique visits into 
the heart of UK communities, the 
programme offers a way to challenge 
business leaders’ perceptions on 
responsibility issues within their 
individual businesses, through their 
supply chains and across industries. 
The event saw senior business leaders 
visit Crest Boys’ Academy, in Neasden, 
and St Joseph’s RC Primary School, 
in Willesden, to see how programmes, 
such as STEMNET and Mosaic, are 
being implemented in order to bridge 
the growing skills gap in the UK. 
The event then moved on to the National 
Grid Tunnelling Project, in Willesden, 
for an insight into what Costain is 
doing to help bridge the skills gap, and 
to meet apprentices, trainee engineers, 
construction ambassadors and 
graduates to gain an understanding 
of the challenges facing young people 
looking to forge a career in a technical 
industry and the importance 
of apprenticeships.

Gold Green Apple Gold Green Apple 
Environment Award Environment Award 
The Costain joint venture working 
on the redevelopment of Farringdon 
station in central London, received 
a prestigious Gold Green Apple 
Environment Award for its sustainable 
approach to building and construction. 
The Green Apple Awards recognise 
environmental best practice and the 
business reasons behind employing 
environmental initiatives in order 
to safeguard the environment. 
The project won by demonstrating 
how sustainable development can 
have both an environmental and 
economic benefit. For example, 
the team diverted 100% of the 
demolition waste from landfill which 
saved £365,000 in landfill tax, 
while reusing the rubble from the 
demolition removed the need for 
approximately 850 lorry movements 
which saved 30 tonnes of CO 2
emissions and approximately 
£70,000 on the cost of additional 
materials. For the new ticket hall, 
instead of using what would have 
amounted to 500 tonnes of steel, 
the team used an eco-reinforced 
alternative that was 95% recycled 
and responsibly sourced.
Costain – selected 
by the Energy 
Technologies 
Institute
Costain was selected by the Energy 
Technologies Institute (‘ETI’) to lead the 
development of the next generation in 
carbon capture technology. The project 
will see a carbon capture pilot plant 
capable of capturing 95% of CO 2
emissions designed, built, operated 
and tested by the middle of 2015. 
40
RoSPA Awards
Our strong Health & Safety performance 
was recognised by the achievement 
of many Health & Safety Awards. 
We received 40 RoSPA Awards, 
comprising 2 Orders of Distinction,
6 Gold Medals, 22 Gold Awards and 
 10 Silver Awards.
The Company 
awarded two 
Big Tick Awards
Costain received recognition in 
Business in the Community’s Awards 
for Excellence 2011. The Company was 
awarded two Big Tick Awards in the 
‘Skills in the Workplace’ and ‘Building 
Stronger Communities’ categories. 
The skills award acknowledged the work 
Costain has put into developing talent 
throughout the organisation at all 
levels – from basic literacy classes for 
local trainees to continuing development 
of the skills of Executive Board members.
The community award recognised 
the efforts the Company made while 
building the Church Village Bypass 
in South Wales. Substantial numbers 
of local unemployed people were 
taken on to the project workforce and 
considerable efforts were made to 
maximise expenditure within the local 
community and small businesses.
 95
%
Costain 
achieved a score 
of 95% in the 
BITC Corporate 
Responsibility 
Index.
Costain achieved a score of 95%, a 
Platinum banding, in the BITC Corporate 
Responsibility (‘CR’) Index 2011. The 
Index helps companies to integrate and 
improve CR throughout their operations 
by providing a systematic approach to 
managing, measuring and reporting 
on business impacts in society and 
on the environment.
“I congratulate Costain on achieving 
Platinum in the 2011 BITC Corporate 
Responsibility Index. It is a challenging 
time, but the results of this year’s 
Index demonstrate that companies 
are still focused on transforming their 
businesses in order to have a positive 
impact on society. All the companies 
who participated this year are at 
different stages in their responsible 
business journey, but they are 
all taking these issues seriously 
and are prepared to lead by example.”

06 Directors’ Report > Business review 
Chairman’s statement 
We are transforming  
Costain into a broad-based 
Tier One engineering 
solutions provider...
Costain delivered 
another strong 
performance  
in 2011, in line  
with the Board’s 
expectations.
It is particularly pleasing to report a 
substantial increase in operating profit 
and an increase in our order book, the 
result of a deliberate and ongoing focus 
on those UK market sectors where there 
is, and will continue to be, significant 
private and public investment to meet 
critical national needs. 
The year also saw Costain pursuing  
its twin strategic objectives of growing 
by acquisition, as well as organically,  
and broadening its range of services to 
include a greater proportion of support 
service activities as we continued  
to build on our position as a leading  
Tier One engineering solutions provider. 
Revenue, including the Group’s  
share of joint ventures and associates,  
for the year was £986.3 million  
(2010: £1,022.5 million). Our focus  
is on higher margin work and 
consequently, Group operating profit, 
before other items, was £24.1 million 
(2010: £17.4 million), an increase of 38%. 
Profit before tax and other items was 
£25.5 million (2010: £27.9 million), with 
the prior year having benefited from  
a profit of £11.2 million realised on  
the transfer of the Group’s interest  
in a portfolio of six PFI investments  
into The Costain Pension Scheme.
Strategic delivery
Costain secured a number of major, 
nationally strategic contracts during the 
year. A highlight was the award of the 
five-year £400 million contract by Network 
Rail for the redevelopment of London 
Bridge station, notable not just for the 
scale and scope of the contract, but  
also that it was awarded in recognition  
of Costain’s proven ability to manage  
such complex projects on its own. 
As a result, the Group’s year-end order 
book increased to £2.5 billion, including 
over £650 million of work already 
secured for 2012. In excess of 90%  
of our order book is from repeat orders 
and support services activities now 
represent 25% of the work secured  
for 2012. Further contract awards  
and extensions since the year-end  
has increased the level of revenue 
secured for 2012 to over £750 million.
 
Whilst the continuing uncertain macro-
economic environment is impacting the 
UK market as a whole with total volumes 
reduced, procurement periods extended 
and a variation of activity levels across 
regions, our strategy of targeting 
customers with committed long-term 
capital and operational spending plans 
has enabled us to pursue and win work 
less affected by the downturn. Moreover, 
we believe that our target customers will 
continue to commit substantial 
expenditure over the medium to 
long-term, providing Costain with 
significant opportunity to grow. 
To achieve that growth, we must also 
continue to diversify and broaden  
the range of services we offer. Our 
‘Choosing Costain’ strategy was 
developed and is being implemented  
in line with major structural market 
changes as our customers increasingly 
seek suppliers who can offer both an 
innovative cost-effective approach and 
provide a broad, end-to-end service 
across the life-cycle of an asset.  
The ongoing drive, both organically  
and by acquisition, to broaden  
our services across engineering 
consultancy, construction, and 
operations and maintenance will  
remain a key priority in 2012. 
Potential acquisitions must meet  
a range of strict criteria, including 
strategic rationale and shareholder value 
enhancement. During the year, we were 
pleased to announce the acquisitions  
of ClerkMaxwell, a front-end engineering 
and operations support services provider 
operating in the upstream oil and gas 
sector, and Promanex, an industrial 
support services business providing 
facilities management, installation, repair 
and maintenance and general asset 
management. Both companies have 
been successfully integrated, are 
operating in line with our expectations, 
and provide Costain with a broader 
range of services to offer its customers.  07
Costain Group PLC Annual Report 2011
Financial statements Other information Corporate Governance Business review Overview
With a £140 million net cash balance 
and no significant debt and with 
banking and bonding facilities increased 
to £465 million, and extended to 
September 2015, the Group is in a very 
strong position to deliver on its strategy. 
Dividend
Reflecting another successful year 
and our continuing confidence in the 
long-term prospects for the Group, the 
Board is recommending an 8% increase 
in the final dividend, the fifth successive 
year of increase. If the 6.75 pence per 
share (2010: 6.25 pence) final dividend 
is approved at the forthcoming Annual 
General Meeting, then it will be paid 
on 25 May 2012 to shareholders on 
the register as at the close of business 
on 20 April 2012. This would bring the 
total for the full year to 10.0 pence per 
share (2010: 9.25 pence), an increase 
of 8% over the prior year.
Staff
The year would not have been a 
success, nor would we be as confident 
for the future, without the people we 
have at Costain. On behalf of the whole 
Board, I would like to express our 
gratitude to all our colleagues and 
place on record our recognition and 
appreciation of their commitment 
to the business.
Group pension scheme
At the year-end, the Group’s pension 
scheme deficit in accordance with 
IAS 19, net of deferred tax, was 
£39.7 million (2010: £28.9 million), 
the increase is primarily as a result of a 
reduction in the discount rate, based on 
corporate bond yields, used to calculate 
the liabilities. We have in place a deficit 
recovery plan based on the latest 
actuarial position as at 31 March 2010, 
agreed with the Pension Scheme 
Trustee and expected to eliminate 
the deficit over a period of less than 
ten years.
Since the year-end, the Group has made 
a further transfer of two PFI investments 
into the scheme at an agreed value of 
£20.3 million. Furthermore, the Group 
has instigated a liability risk management 
exercise and is in the process of issuing 
Enhanced Transfer Value and Pension 
Increase Exchange offers to the 
members of The Costain Pension 
Scheme. Together, the above actions 
are estimated to reduce the pension 
deficit by approximately £16 million, 
with an associated potential reduction 
in annual deficit contributions, following 
the next triennial actuarial valuation of 
The Costain Pension Scheme which is 
due as at 31 March 2013. Full details 
of these measures are contained 
in the Group Finance Director’s review.
Summary and outlook 
Costain delivered another strong 
performance in 2011, with operating 
profit up substantially and an increased 
order book. 
The Group has been successful in 
targeting those blue-chip customers 
who are spending billions of pounds 
per annum on essential capital projects 
and ongoing maintenance of essential, 
nationally strategic assets. This provides 
a major opportunity to grow the 
business further.
We are transforming Costain into a 
broad-based Tier One engineering 
solutions provider, aligned with structural 
market changes. Winning projects such 
as the complex £400 million London 
Bridge redevelopment is testimony 
to that. Meanwhile, our strong cash 
position, robust balance sheet and 
increased banking and bonding facilities 
provide us with the resources to grow 
the business by acquisition as well 
as organically.
Our confidence in Costain’s future, and 
in achieving our ambition of doubling 
profit over the medium term, is reflected 
in the Board’s recommendation to 
increase the final dividend for the 
fifth successive year.

CEO 
interview
Q&A with Andrew Wyllie
Q
The Company is 
focused on Meeting 
National Needs... 
what does that mean?
A “Successful companies measure 
their value by their relevance to the 
external world. At Costain, we have 
identified the clear national priorities 
which are fundamental to ensuring 
the UK has a competitive future and 
an infrastructure which can support 
commerce and community alike. 
Whether it is solving transport 
congestion, avoiding an energy 
crisis, reducing the waste problem 
or supporting education, enterprise 
and employment, these are issues 
critical to generating economic growth 
and ensuring the nation’s future. 
“Costain has the technical skills, 
experience and commitment to play 
a significant role in providing solutions 
to meet these national needs. In recent 
years the Company has been at the 
forefront of developments in a number 
of areas including transport, nuclear 
decommissioning, water supply and 
developing skills needed for the future 
and we will continue to be so. Our 
customers have long-term investment 
programmes underpinned by strategic 
needs, regulatory commitments or 
essential maintenance requirements 
and they need high-quality service 
providers such as Costain.”
Q
Costain describes itself 
as an engineering solutions 
provider... but is that not 
a description which many 
companies could employ?
A “No it is not. We only focus on 
major blue-chip customers, and they 
are looking to work with fewer number 
of Tier One service providers, through 
longer-term, larger contracts 
incorporating a broader range of services 
across the life-cycle of their assets. 
To be an engineering solutions provider 
to these customers, it is essential that 
you are able to demonstrate that you 
have the necessary scale, experience 
and financial strength to be able 
to deliver a broad range of services 
through consulting, construction 
and operations and maintenance.”
Q
Costain states that it is 
‘Transforming’... but what 
is the evidence to support 
that in the last 12 months?
A “Costain is being transformed as we 
develop and grow our capability, both 
organically and by targeted acquisition. 
In 2011, we acquired two companies 
with precisely that aim in mind.
“In May 2011, we announced the 
acquisition of Aberdeen-based 
front-end engineering and operations 
support services provider ClerkMaxwell. 
This enabled Costain to offer customers 
full hydrocarbon value chain capability 
from upstream oil and gas, gas 
processing, LNG and gas storage, 
right through to downstream 
activities. ClerkMaxwell’s customer 
list includes such names as TOTAL, 
Chevron and ConocoPhillips and 
the acquisition was another important 
step for Costain into a vital market. 
Then in August 2011, we acquired 
Promanex, an industrial support 
services business which strengthened 
Costain’s presence in key growth 
target markets particularly in power, 
nuclear process, hydrocarbons 
and chemicals and water. 
“Over a quarter of our income secured 
for 2012 now comes from support 
service activity as we align our services 
with our customers’ requirements. 
Costain is now delivering the largest 
waste PFI project in Europe, the largest 
nuclear decommissioning project in the 
UK, and is the leading service provider 
to the Highways Agency.”
“Over a quarter of our 
income secured for 
2012 now comes from 
support service activity 
as we align our services 
with our customers’ 
requirements.” Q
Costain provides 
a service to customers 
but in your six-year tenure 
as CEO how has that 
‘service’ changed?
A “Over that time we have focused 
entirely on meeting the needs of the 
sophisticated major customers who 
have larger investment programmes. 
We have dispensed with one-off 
contracting relationships. We have 
moved away from customers and 
business opportunities where we 
cannot establish a competitive 
advantage. As a result of that focus 
we have lots of opportunities to grow 
the business. We have moved away 
from international construction activities 
where the risk was not commensurate 
with the return. Our customer base now 
includes some of the best known names 
in industry all with long-term specific 
needs. We have a wider skills base than 
before and we are capable of competing 
at new levels because we now have 
a stronger, more comprehensive 
service involving front-end engineering 
consultancy, construction and 
ongoing care and maintenance.”

Q
What makes 
Costain different 
from its competitors?
A “Our people, and our culture. 
We have some of the best people in the 
industry, and I am very proud of them. 
The evidence of their performance and 
achievements is reflected in the 90% 
repeat orders we receive from our 
customers. It is that premier level 
of performance coupled with the 
Company’s values and heritage which 
makes Costain unique. Our customers 
know that a Costain person possesses 
high levels of skill, integrity and 
commitment. It is precisely that 
combination which makes the 
Costain service special.”
Q
As CEO you have 
taken on responsibility 
for the Costain heritage 
and you also make 
continual reference to 
‘Transforming Costain’... 
are the two compatible?
A “Absolutely. The Costain reputation 
has been built on a long history of 
innovation, leadership and constantly 
adapting to changing requirements. 
Around the globe, people have 
witnessed Costain teams adapting 
to and overcoming difficult conditions 
and providing exactly what clients 
required. In the current age, we are 
continuing that philosophy by adapting 
and growing the Costain capability 
to meet the needs we all face now. 
As long as we continue to quickly 
drive innovation into our products, 
and enhance our service at a price 
point that customers are willing to pay, 
then we will continue to grow.”
Q
Do you expect the 
major changes in Costain 
in the next five years 
to be internally driven 
or externally driven?
A “Both. Our growth aspirations 
will be achieved through a combination 
of organic growth and by suitable 
acquisitions in line with strategy. This will 
allow us to accelerate the development 
of the Group, and is how we will broaden 
and improve the quality of earnings 
stream. Ultimately, it is the customers 
who place the orders, and therefore 
decide our destiny. With over 90% 
repeat orders in an increased order 
book, we have a good platform to take 
the business forward successfully over 
the next five years.”

10 Directors’ Report > Business review 
The Board continues to believe that, 
over the next decade, such expenditure 
will be primarily in the critical areas of 
transport, energy, water and waste, 
where national needs are being 
addressed. These areas provide a 
strong and sustainable pipeline of future 
investment to ensure energy security, 
the provision of a sustainable water 
supply, and creating key transport 
infrastructure capable of supporting 
vital economic growth.
We are continuing to transform the 
Group through the implementation of 
our ‘Choosing Costain’ strategy and are 
reinforcing our position as one of the 
UK’s top Tier One engineering solutions 
providers, with well-established positions 
in sectors such as highways, water 
and rail.
Our business model
Chief Executive’s review 
Andrew Wyllie outlines the 
successful transformation 
of the business and gives 
the reasons behind a strong 
performance in 2011. 
Alongside this imperative is the reality of 
the global macro-economic environment 
and the impact it is having on the 
prioritisation of spending plans. 
We have, therefore, maintained a focus 
on targeting and working with blue-chip 
customers in sectors whose spending 
activity is underpinned by strategic 
national needs, regulatory commitments 
or essential maintenance requirements. 
Our target customers are spending 
billions of pounds per annum on capital, 
operations and maintenance contracts. 
In its 2011 Autumn Statement, the UK 
Government identified an increase in 
infrastructure investment, and has 
recently announced the go-ahead 
for the second high-speed rail link. 
Notwithstanding this welcome increase 
in commitment from the public sector, 
by far the majority of future spending 
is expected to continue to come 
from the private sector. 
Costain has 
delivered another 
strong performance. 
An increase of 38% 
in operating profit, 
an increase in the 
size of the order 
book and an 
increase in the 
recommended 
final dividend are 
testimony to the 
success of our 
strategy and its 
implementation.
The UK faces unprecedented 
challenges, including the impact of 
a rapidly growing population, climate 
change, and the need to ensure a 
secure, sustainable and balanced 
portfolio of energy sources. An ageing 
and increasingly obsolete infrastructure 
means that there is a clear and 
recognised national need for 
strategic investment.

Costain Group PLC Annual Report 2011
Financial statements Other information Corporate Governance Business review Overview
We are developing the skills, capabilities 
and service offering necessary to meet 
the changing needs of our major 
customers. They are increasingly 
expecting Tier One suppliers to provide 
broad and bespoke solutions to their 
specific requirements by delivering an 
innovative service across engineering 
consultancy, construction and operations 
and maintenance, through larger and 
longer-term bundled contracts. 
These skills enable us to engineer 
solutions to meet some of the country’s 
most complex and pressing national 
needs. For example, Costain is delivering 
the largest waste PFI project in Europe, 
the largest nuclear decommissioning 
project in the UK and is the leading 
service provider to the Highways Agency.
In addition to the organic development 
of those skills within Costain, for the 
first time in over 20 years, Costain 
augmented the implementation of its 
strategy through the acquisition of two 
businesses, ClerkMaxwell, an upstream 
oil and gas consultancy, and Promanex, 
an industrial support services business. 
Both businesses have been integrated 
successfully and are performing well 
and in line with our expectations.
ClerkMaxwell provides Costain 
with a full hydrocarbons value chain 
capability from upstream oil and gas, 
gas processing, LNG and gas storage 
through to downstream, and provides 
the Group with access to a larger and 
broader customer base in the oil & 
gas sector.
Promanex’s customer base includes 
such blue-chip companies as 
ConocoPhillips, EDF, E.ON, Magnox, 
RWE, Scottish and Southern Energy, 
Siemens and TOTAL, a number of 
which are existing Costain customers.
Consequently, the services we can offer 
to our customers, and the composition of 
our earnings, are being transformed as 
we broaden the business through the 
implementation of our strategy. Currently, 
25% of our 2012 order book now comes 
from support services activities and we 
expect this to continue to grow. 
Core to our transformation and our 
value proposition to customers is our 
‘Costain Cares’ initiative which places 
responsible, effective and collaborative 
stakeholder relationships at the core 
of everything that we do.

Andrew Wyllie Chief Executive Officer Costain Group PLC Annual Report 2011
12 Directors’ Report > Business review
This ranges from taking a unique  
and innovative approach to finding 
solutions for each individual customer 
requirement, to wider initiatives such as 
our school leavers’ apprentice scheme 
or our participation in an ex-offenders’ 
programme. As well as having a 
beneficial effect on our corporate 
culture, these factors differentiate us 
from our peer group, are an increasingly 
important factor in our stakeholders’ 
selection processes, and have directly 
contributed to the award of our largest 
contracts this year. 
Increased order book providing 
long-term earnings visibility
Costain’s strategy is to focus on 
securing longer term and higher  
margin contracts from major blue-chip 
customers. Whilst this approach  
has led to a decrease in revenue in  
2011, our operating profit and quality  
of earnings have improved significantly.
During the year, we secured new 
contracts and extensions to existing 
contracts of some £1.1 billion and as  
a consequence, the Group finished the 
year with an increased forward order 
book of £2.5 billion (2010: £2.4 billion), 
providing good earnings visibility.  
The order book included in excess of 
£650 million of work secured for 2012 
(December 2010: circa £800 million 
secured for 2011), and over £1.8 billion  
of revenue secured for 2013 and 
beyond. In addition, we again ended  
the year with preferred bidder positions 
on contracts with an aggregate value  
in excess of £400 million. Further 
contract awards and extensions since 
the year-end have increased the level  
of revenue secured for 2012 to over 
£750 million. These include a £60 million 
three-year maintenance contract for  
a new customer in the energy sector,  
a contract we were able to secure  
as a consequence of the skills acquired 
following the purchase of Promanex. 
We are delighted that major customers 
continue to reappoint Costain for their 
investment plans with the result that 
repeat orders now account for in excess 
of 90% of the order book. We were also 
pleased to secure a number of new 
customers during the year with the 
potential for increasing the scope and 
scale of work we do for them. 
The focus on key customers, and the 
provision of value-adding solutions  
to complex challenges, has ensured  
that Costain has maintained a strong 
pipeline of business development 
opportunities. During the year, we 
increased our business development 
and bidding activity to capitalise on 
these opportunities, resulting in an 
increase in the order book. 
Progress in Operations
The Group has three core divisions: 
Environment, Infrastructure and 
Energy & Process.
The Environment division focuses on 
the water and waste markets as well  
as the specific requirements of a number  
of long-term customers. Customer 
spend in this market is underpinned by 
regulatory and legislative requirements 
and is expected to grow over the 
medium and long-term.
Revenue (including share of joint 
ventures and associates) in the 
division for the year was £375.4 million 
(2010: £489.8 million), with profit  
from operations of £17.5 million  
(2010: £17.2 million including profit  
of £11.2 million from the transfer of  
six PFI investments into The Costain 
Pension Scheme). Underlying operating 
profits increased very significantly, 
reflecting strong project delivery 
performance and the successful 
close-out of a number of legacy issues 
well within our allowances. The reduction  
in revenue in this division was fully 
anticipated and is a consequence  
of the strategic decision to withdraw 
from lower margin activities, as well  
as a slower than anticipated start  
to the AMP 5 programme of work.
The division finished the year with  
a forward order book of £0.8 billion  
(2010: £1.2 billion), the reduction 
reflecting the completion of a number  
of historic contracts in the year. With  
our established positions in water and 
waste, and the continued broadening  
of our services portfolio, we look forward 
with confidence to continued progress  
in this division.
The Infrastructure division, which 
incorporates activities in the highways, 
rail and airports sectors, saw a year  
of significantly increased investment  
in business development in order  
to take advantage of a strong pipeline  
of opportunities. 
 
Revenue (including share of joint 
ventures and associates) in the division 
for the year increased to £466.0 million 
(2010: £395.3 million) although adjusted 
profit from operations decreased to 
£10.2 million (2010: £12.2 million).  
This short term decrease reflects the 
costs associated with the higher level  
of bidding activity, which has resulted  
in a 36% increase in the order book  
to £1.5 billion (2010: £1.1 billion), as well 
as the costs of the Promanex acquisition 
and additional costs for the completion 
of a project.
The Energy & Process division 
undertakes work in the hydrocarbons 
and chemicals, nuclear process and 
power sectors.
Revenue (including share of joint 
ventures and associates) in the division 
for the year increased to £143.4 million 
(2010: £136.6 million) with adjusted  
profit from operations of £4.7 million 
(2010: £8.2 million). Profits were 
impacted by increased investment in 
business development, the costs to 
complete the ClerkMaxwell acquisition 
and the additional costs required  
to complete a project in Abu Dhabi.  
The division’s year-end order book  
has increased to £215 million  
(2010: £127 million) and we see  
a number of exciting opportunities  
for further growth in this division.

Costain Group PLC Annual Report 2011
Financial statements Other information Corporate Governance Business review Overview
Our non-core Land Development
activity in Spain, which is a joint venture 
with a subsidiary of Santander Bank, 
continued to be subject to very difficult 
market conditions. Revenue was 
£1.5 million (2010: £0.8 million) and 
the loss after tax was £2.0 million 
(2010 £1.8 million). As anticipated, no 
land sales were completed in the year 
and land development activity has been 
scaled back until the market improves 
and maximum shareholder value can 
be secured for the assets. Our activities 
during the year have been focused 
on our leisure businesses of golf 
courses and our 600-berth yacht 
marina adjacent to Gibraltar. 
Further detail on each operating division 
is contained within the Business review.
Enhancing our Safety, Health and 
Environmental performance
Costain places the highest priority on 
the effective management of Safety, 
Health and Environment. 
Further progress was made in the year 
and we again recorded an improved 
Group Accident Frequency Rate (‘AFR’) 
reducing from 0.15 to a new record low 
of 0.11, which continues to compare 
favourably with our major Tier One 
peer group. 
We received 22 RoSPA Gold safety 
Awards and two prestigious Orders of 
Distinction recognising 15 consecutive 
annual Gold Awards. 
A significant achievement was an 
external accreditation by the Cambridge 
Centre for Behavioural Studies for our 
in-house Costain Behavioural Safety 
initiative. We are the first company in the 
UK to achieve this accreditation and it is 
a unique differentiator for our industry.
However, despite our continuous 
vigilance and focus on our safety 
performance, there was a fatal accident 
involving an employee of a subcontractor 
on the Newbury Parkway project. Also, 
four Costain employees were killed 
in a fire in an accommodation facility 
in Abu Dhabi. The cause of the fire, 
which was in a facility not owned or 
operated by Costain, is still being 
investigated by the authorities. 
Everyone in Costain extends their 
deepest sympathies to the families 
of those involved.
We received our first Platinum award 
following an external assessment by 
Business in the Community, recognising 
our proactive commitment to mitigating 
the environmental and social impacts 
of our operations. 
Developing our team
A strong business is one that employs 
and retains good and motivated people. 
During the year, we increased our 
training and development programmes 
across the organisation to ensure that 
we continue to have the requisite skills 
and resources. There was a 30% 
increase in the number of training days 
which, through improved efficiency, 
were delivered at a lower total cost 
than in 2010.
There was also an increase in the 
number of apprentices across the Group 
and the introduction of a new graduate 
development programme.
Tracey Wood became Group Company 
Secretary on 1 June 2011, following the 
retirement of Clive Franks after 30 years 
of service with Costain. Tracey continues 
to be responsible for HR and legal 
matters on the Executive Board, whilst 
Fiona Ware has been promoted to 
Group HR Director reporting to Tracey.
Summary 
Costain has delivered another 
strong performance.
The implementation of our ‘Choosing 
Costain’ strategy continues to transform 
the Group, as we develop or acquire 
the skills and capabilities to reinforce 
our position as one of the UK’s leading 
Tier One engineering solutions providers.
Looking ahead, whilst mindful of 
economic conditions, we see significant 
opportunity for the continued successful 
implementation of our strategy which, 
in turn, will lead to the delivery of the 
Board’s ambition of doubling profit 
over the medium-term.
I look forward to reporting on further 
progress during the year.

Today’s environment requires businesses to innovate at a faster 
rate than ever before. Our response to this trend and to the 
need to provide the right product or service to our customers 
has led to our focus on developing intelligent solutions.
Cost competitiveness
In a challenging global economy, businesses continue

Our market focus
Why these markets are attractive to Costain
Targeting £billions worth of committed spend (based on estimated annual industry spend)
Water 
£11bn
Water resources are already under pressure 
as a result of both climate change and 
population growth. The resulting impact 
suggests reduced water availability with 
a greater supply/demand gap. DEFRA’s 
latest predictions show that even with 
a good Climate Change scenario the areas 
in water deficit will more than double 
over the next 20 years. 
Waste
£8bn
As the UK works to reduce waste, the 
market continues to show significant growth, 
principally as a result of the UK Government’s 
objective to become a ‘zero waste’ economy. 
This typically favours prevention, reuse 
and recycling, rather than landfills and 
incineration. It is predicted that the waste 
management market will increase by 22% 
in terms of value over the next five years. 
Highways
£8bn
Increasing population and migration towards 
urban hubs has resulted in greater pressure 
on our road network. It is predicted that total 
vehicle traffic will grow by 25% by 2025 and 
43% by 2035 (both compared to 2003) with 
average delays set to increase by over 50%, 
driving a significant demand for more efficient 
use of the assets through effective 
maintenance and technology.
Rail
£17bn
As the population continues to grow, rail has 
become a vital form of transport to move 
within and between increasingly congested 
cities. As Network Rail and TfL continue to 
plan for a significant growth in passenger 
usages, TfL predicts a 30% growth in 
passengers by 2031 and is spending 
£1.5 billion annually on London Underground 
and currently £875 million on Crossrail. 
High-Speed 2 offers a £32.7 billion 
opportunity until 2026, whilst Network Rail 
and the Train Operating Companies continue 
to invest significant sums in the development 
of the national rail network.
Nuclear process
£4bn
The Nuclear Decommissioning Authority 
has committed to a lifetime investment of 
£49.5 billion for the decommissioning and 
clean-up of civil nuclear sites around the UK.
Government remains committed to safely 
dealing with the legacy from the post-war 
nuclear research programme and 
subsequent first generation of nuclear 
power stations. Volume growth of nuclear 
fuel demand in the global markets continues 
to drive fuel cycle investment plans and, 
in defence, the Government has confirmed 
its commitment to replacement of the 
UK’s deterrent.
Power
£10bn
The key challenges facing the UK today are 
to ensure that future electricity supply is 
secure, low-carbon and affordable. Security 
of supply is threatened as approximately a 
quarter (20 GW) of existing power generation 
capacity will soon shut down. To provide 
clean energy, investment is required in new 
nuclear, renewable and carbon capture. 
Whilst we continue to maintain existing 
infrastructure, extending its life and, where 
feasible, converting it to a more sustainable 
fuel source. This will help to enable the 
transition of the UK to a low-carbon economy 
and meet the 15% renewable energy target 
by 2020. DECC forecasts that approximately 
£75 billion of investment could be needed in 
new electricity generation capacity by 2020.
Hydrocarbons 
and Chemicals
£20bn
The upstream oil and gas sector is set to 
maintain significant activity in the North 
Sea and the Middle East, with investment 
of up to £140 billion over the next decade. 
This is underpinned by the soaring demand 
from China and other developing markets, 
dwindling oil reserves, increased unrest in 
the Middle East and increased pressure 
from oil speculators. Driving enhanced 
oil recovery techniques are increasingly 
being deployed to improve hydrocarbon 
recovery. Currently, the UK recovers only 
around 40% of the hydrocarbons from 
existing reservoirs and so increasing this 
by even a small amount would be hugely 
beneficial – around £12 billion for every 
additional 1% of recovery.

Increase  
capacity
The UK’s rail network is seeing  
the highest level of usage in  
peacetime since the 1920s,  
according to the Association  
of Train Operating Companies.
Recent figures show that, since 
privatisation was completed, 
passenger numbers have increased 
by 69% to more than 1.35 billion 
passenger journeys a year and 
demand is expected to double  
in the next 25 years. That means 
investment in the UK’s rail 
infrastructure is vital to keep  
pace with demand, support the 
country’s economic growth and  
to ensure passenger satisfaction, 
punctuality and safety.
The backbone of the national rail 
network was largely completed by 
1851, while the first underground 
railway opened in London in 1863. 
While we can still marvel at the 
ingenuity, and in many cases the 
beauty, of Victorian construction  
and engineering, the rail 
infrastructure as it stands today  
isn’t able to support the volume  
of people that depend on it.
 
Without attention and urgent action, 
the performance of this infrastructure 
will deteriorate and the UK risks 
falling behind its trading partners  
in Europe and the rest of the world.  
A country’s infrastructure can 
influence business decisions on 
whether or not to locate in the UK. 
The Government’s strategy  
for the country’s rail is a mixture  
of getting more from existing  
railway infrastructure through 
upgrades and to increase  
capacity on inter-urban routes.
The Government has pledged  
to improve the railway network, 
including bringing forward bridge 
renewals, increase electrification, 
continually improve safety, enhance 
access and capacity at stations and 
reduce disruption to the rail network. 
Costain’s Rail Sector has a strong 
track record in addressing these 
needs and is well positioned to 
deliver world class infrastructure, 
using innovative technology,  
design and engineering solutions.

Innovative  
technology, design  
and construction 
Much of Costain’s recent work in the  
rail sector has been focused around 
London. This is because of the large 
number of major transport hubs located 
in the capital and their connectivity with 
other cities in the UK.
Costain is working with its customers  
to increase capacity by upgrading 
existing stations and developing new 
infrastructure such as Crossrail, the 
biggest rail project in Europe, which  
will significantly increase the capacity  
of the rail network into and across 
London and relieve congestion and 
overcrowding on the existing rail and 
underground networks.
Costain, in joint venture, is currently 
redeveloping London Underground’s 
(‘LU’) Bond Street station as part of LU’s 
Tube Upgrade Programme. More than 
155,000 passengers use Bond Street 
tube station every day and that figure  
is expected to rise to over 225,000  
with the arrival of Crossrail in 2018.
Costain is using Building Information 
Modelling (‘BIM’) technology and 
systems at Bond Street to overcome 
potential problems associated with 
working on a site in close proximity  
to a large transport network and  
major utilities.
BIM allows engineers to generate and 
manage a large amount of data by 
checking for structural, architectural and 
building services clashes within existing  21

“ Building on the success of delivering major rail 
infrastructure projects like St Pancras International, 
Costain’s multidisciplinary capabilities are increasingly 
being used not only to deliver demanding programmes  
of works but also to provide innovative solutions  
more effectively in order to bring greater benefits  
to customers and passengers alike.”

structures. It also analyses geometry, 
spatial relationships and geographic 
information, which can save time and 
money not only in the design stage  
but also as the project progresses.
LU now specifies the use of BIM on  
all complex projects in order to mitigate  
risk during the design and construction 
of major assets in a live working  
railway environment.
The expanded tube station will include  
an interchange with Crossrail, the  
118km high-frequency rail route that  
will run from Maidenhead and Heathrow 
in the west, through new twin-bore 21km 
tunnels under central London, before 
forking at Stepney Green for Shenfield 
near Brentwood, and Abbey Wood  
in southeast London.
In September, Costain, in joint venture, 
handed over the first of five tunnel 
portals at Royal Oak while continuing  
to work on another tunnel portal at 
Pudding Mill Lane near Stratford.  
The portals will act as an entry point  
for the tunnel boring machines that  
are constructing the Crossrail tunnels.
Meanwhile, in July, Costain was 
appointed by Crossrail, in joint venture, 
to redevelop Paddington station and 
maximise the station’s space while 
preserving, as Costain did at St Pancras 
International, the historic features of the 
mainline station. The new station will 
take the form of a 260m long, 25m  
wide and 23m deep underground box.
More recently, Costain was appointed  
to carry out detailed design and deliver  
a redeveloped London Bridge station  
for Network Rail and it recently 
completed a major milestone in the 
delivery of the Farringdon station 
redevelopment, in constructing longer 
platforms that allow 12-car trains  
to use the station.
Scheduled for completion in 2018,  
the London Bridge project will see 
through-station passenger capacity  
rise to 90 million people a year  
from 55 million. At Farringdon, the 
redevelopment includes a new train 
shed roof, refurbishing the original 
London Underground entrance, a new 
ticket hall serving both Thameslink and 
Crossrail passengers, replacement of 
the highway bridge to the front of the 
station, the installation of new power 
supplies and plant rooms, three new 
escape staircases and the installation  
of five new lifts to allow step-free  
access from platforms to street level.
Outside London, Reading is one of the  
UK’s busiest stations, handling around  
17 million passengers annually, serving 
the Great Western Main Line for express 
trains to South Wales and the West 
Country, as well as being the terminus 
for a network of local routes throughout 
Berkshire, Oxfordshire and Hampshire.
Here, Costain, in joint venture,  
recently handed over a new Platform 4 
to Network Rail, while a new temporary 
Platform 10 was built in the middle  
of existing running lines, with tracks 
diverted around it. Costain Group PLC Annual Report 2011

Capacity 
enhancements
Costain’s ‘Meeting National Needs’ 
focus is geared towards helping its 
customers meet society’s needs by 
addressing the growing demand for 
infrastructure services, extracting greater 
value from existing infrastructure and 
being more efficient in how those 
services are delivered.
In line with this, Costain has increasingly 
employed lean engineering, which 
involves cutting waste and applying 
innovative tailor-made solutions to 
project specific problems. The aim  
is to deliver the same or better product 
while using few resources, which can 
save time and money.
An example of this is the M53 Bidston 
Moss Viaduct Refurbishment Scheme 
on the Wirral. The 730m long, 37-span 
steel box-girder structure was built in 
1969 and had slowly deteriorated  
with time. Weight restrictions had to  
be imposed and heavy goods vehicles  
were precluded from crossing it, which 
disrupted goods going to market.
Costain strengthened the structure  
and returned it to full capacity  
using lean engineering and found  
£2.8 million in cost savings on  
the £90 million project.
“Customers are under increasing 
pressure to find savings on their capital 
projects and this has significantly 
influenced how they procure work.

Engineering solutions –  
The road to safety
Reduce  
congestion
A safe, reliable and well maintained 
infrastructure network is vital for  
the future prosperity of the country. 
The efficient movement of goods and 
people, supported by a balanced, 
dynamic and low-carbon-economy  
is essential if the nation wants to 
compete on the world stage.
A well-functioning road network 
promotes growth by reducing 
business costs, improving access  
to markets, increasing labour mobility 
and attracting inward investment. 
Highways act as major arteries which 
open up new opportunities for leisure 
and travel and the development  
of urban and suburban areas.
The Strategic Road Network (‘SRN’), 
managed by the Highways Agency, 
carries nearly a third of all traffic  
and two-thirds of all freight traffic, 
despite making up only 3% of the  
total road network.
Investing in that infrastructure is  
key to the Government’s economic 
strategy. In its National Infrastructure 
Plan (‘NIP’) released in November 
2011, the Government set out its 
long-term strategy to keep the  
country moving. 
This included improving the capacity, 
performance and resilience of  
the nation’s roads, railways and 
international gateways; improve 
integration between different modes  
of transport; support the move  
to a low-carbon economy and 
improve connectivity and capacity 
between main urban areas.
The Department for Transport 
forecasts congestion across the 
English road network to increase  
from 2003 levels by 27% by 2025  
and by 54% by 2035. While traffic  
is expected to shift to less 
congested roads, it is expected  
that congestion will ultimately 
increase over time.
The economic cost of not alleviating 
congestion on the road network  
could be considerable, but the costs 
are significantly outweighed by the 
financial benefits if the problem is 
tackled. The Eddington Transport 
Study, published in 2006, estimates 
that with a 5% reduction in travel 
time for all business and freight 
travel on the roads, a cost saving  
of £2.5 billion, or 0.2% of GDP,  
could be generated.
While the Government is investing  
£1 billion to tackle areas of 
congestion and improve the national 
road network, the NIP also sets out 
extensive recommendations to 
reduce the cost of infrastructure 
delivery and realise cost savings 
while still providing better value  
for money for taxpayers, road  
users and the wider economy.
In this new economic and 
commercial environment, customers 
like the Highways Agency are now 
more discerning in how they procure 
services from contractors and 
suppliers. That means companies 
working with the Highways Agency 
and other major customers need  
to work smarter to improve service 
delivery and drive out cost and  
waste in order to maintain the  
quality of service.
The solution The need  23

significant cost savings for the 
customer,” said Darren James, 
Managing Director of Costain’s 
Infrastructure division.
Costain, in joint venture, is involved  
in four Managing Agent Contracts,  
or MACs, on behalf of the Highways 
Agency, including Area 7 in the East 
Midlands and Areas 10, 12 and 14  
which cover the majority of the north  
of England. A MAC combines roles  
that were previously undertaken by 
separate Managing Agents and Term 
Maintenance Contractors, with an 
emphasis on innovation to deliver  
a value-added service. 
That means designing a service more  
closely aligned to the customer’s  
needs and rigorously reviewing  
how that service is delivered.
Costain is also involved in a number  
of Managed Motorways Schemes on 
behalf of the Highways Agency. This 
comprises a ‘tool box’ of measures to 
manage road capacity, traffic demand 
and incidents in order to increase the 
efficiency of road use and reliability of 
journey times. Some of the measures 
include hard shoulder running, which 
uses the hard shoulder along more 
congested sections of the highway  
when traffic demand exceeds the 
capacity of normal running lanes.
Costain maintains around one-third  
of the SRN of motorways and major 
A-roads in England, on behalf of the 
Highways Agency and often in joint 
operation with other contractors, and  
is also involved in a number of major 
highway schemes on behalf of local 
authorities in England and Wales.
Costain helped to deliver £15 million 
worth of cost savings in the Early 
Contractor Involvement phase of the 
Port Talbot Peripheral Distributor Road 
(‘PDR’) Stage 2 project for Neath Port 
Talbot County Borough Council, through 
managing innovative client specific 
solutions which ensured the project 
went ahead and continued to receive 
funding from the Welsh Assembly.
The Port Talbot PDR will be an  
important catalyst for the regeneration 
and economic development of the 
industrial area of Port Talbot by providing 
direct access to the M4 motorway  
and dock area. The three-mile link  
road will also remove local traffic  
from the M4 and reduce congestion  
in a restricted corridor.
The savings also delivered improved  
cost benefit assessment results for the 
scheme, which helped inform the award  
of a European Convergence grant  
of £59 million for the scheme. 
Costain’s ‘Meeting National Needs’ 
focus is helping, within the new 
economic and commercial environment, 
to address the country’s highways 
infrastructure requirements, and  
working with the customer using 
innovative solutions to arrive  
at the best possible outcome.  Costain Group PLC Annual Report 2011

Carbon Capture  
and Storage (‘CCS’) 
technology
Costain Energy & Process was selected  
in July by the Energy Technologies 
Institute (‘ETI’), a public private 
partnership between six global industrial 
companies – BP , Caterpillar, EDF, E.ON, 
Rolls-Royce and Shell – and the UK 
Government, to help develop the next 
generation of carbon capture technology.
While key elements of the CCS 
technology have been proven to  
work, this hasn’t been achieved on  
a commercial basis. The challenge  
then is to develop the next generation  
of carbon capture technology which  
not only increases the carbon capture 
rate but also improves capital costs  
and power generation efficiencies  
in comparison to conventional  
capture schemes.
Reduce CO
2
 
emissions
The UK faces three long-term 
challenges to meet its energy 
requirements: to ensure secure,  
clean and affordable energy as  
it becomes even more dependent  
on imported fossil fuels, secondly,  
to tackle climate change by reducing 
CO 2 emissions and thirdly, to keep 
prices for electricity at a level 
affordable for both domestic  
and industrial consumers.
Global warming and climate  
change are international issues 
which potentially threaten the  
basic elements of life on the planet, 
including access to water, food 
production, health and the use  
of land and the environment. 
The International Energy Agency 
forecasts global energy demand  
to rise by 53% by 2030, with energy 
related greenhouse gas emissions 
expected to rise by 55%. Based  
on current trends, global emissions  
of CO 2 are set to reach double  
that of 2007 levels before 2050. 
Therefore, the gap in which to reform 
the global economy to a low-carbon 
footing is shrinking. 
Accordingly, it is therefore imperative 
that the risk of using fossil fuels  
is managed and new technologies  
are harnessed to try and reduce  
the impact of carbon emissions.
In 2008, the Government brought  
in the Climate Change Act which 
created a new legal framework for 
the UK achieving, through domestic 
and international action, at least a 
34% reduction in emissions by 2020 
and an 80% reduction by 2050, 
against 1990 levels. These targets 
are underpinned by five-year carbon 
budgets which place binding limits  
on aggregate CO 2 emissions. 
In order to reach these targets,  
a major component of the 
Government’s strategy is to provide 
more support and promote the  
use of low-carbon technologies.

Costain Group PLC Annual Report 2011
Financial statements Other information Corporate Governance Business review Overview
CCS is an emerging combination  
of technologies that enables the  
capture of CO 2 generated from fossil  
fuel combustion or other industrial 
processes. The captured CO 2 is then 
transported via pipes and injected  
into long-term storage sites such  
as abandoned gas and oil fields  
and deep saline aquifers.
Costain, working in conjunction with 
Edinburgh University and Imperial 
College London, is undertaking the  
first phase of the project, which is the 
front-end engineering design, valued  
at £3.5 million. The new plant design  
will allow the capture of 95% of CO 2 
from gases within a power station.
Thereafter, Costain will design, build, 
operate and test the new £20 million 
carbon capture pilot plant by the  
middle of 2015. 
The Government is fully supportive  
and committed to harnessing the 
potential of CCS as a means of  
reaching its targets and it is looking  
at ways of reducing the costs of  
CCS technology so that it is cost-
competitive in the 2020s. 
Analysis from the IEA suggests that  
CCS technology will play a vital role  
in worldwide, cost-effective efforts  
to limit global warming. The use of  
CCS technology would allow electricity  
to be generated based on burning coal 
and gas, and it can also be deployed 
alongside low-carbon sources such  
as nuclear and offshore wind farms. 
Costain is playing a significant role  
in developing new technology that will  
help address a national need to develop 
clean energy, reduce emissions of  
CO 2 and help the UK meet its climate 
change targets.
“ The causes and threat of climate change are global  
and the UK is at the forefront in trying to establish  
the next generation in carbon capture technology that  
will significantly reduce the risk of further damage  
to the environment and make CCS technology viable  
for generations to come. 
“ Innovation is central to what we do as a Group and,  
in line with our strategy of Meeting National Needs,  
we have the opportunity to help significantly reduce  
the amount of CO
2
 that is produced by coal fired power 
stations. Demonstration of this project is key to building 
user group confidence in the capture technology.”

Performing responsibly
During the course of the year, the  
Group restructured its geotechnical 
services activity into a broader 
Environmental Services consultancy 
which secured a place on the 
Environment Agency’s National Site 
Investigation Framework (‘NSIF’).  
The consultancy has also added a 
number of innovative services, such  
as aerial photography and 3D laser 
scanning, which enable us to offer  
a more attractive portfolio of services  
to our customers. 
In 2011, we substantially closed out our 
portfolio of schools in the final phase  
of the Bradford Building Schools for the 
Future (‘BSF’) programme. In our Local 
Education Partnership with Lewisham, 
also under the BSF programme, we 
continue to deliver a programme of new 
schools which will continue through 
2012. During the year, we successfully 
handed over the first phase of the 
Newbury Parkway shopping centre 
development with the remainder 
scheduled for completion in 2012.
The UK waste market continues  
to offer significant long-term growth 
opportunities for Costain. In 2011,  
we continued to make progress on  
our delivery of the Greater Manchester 
Waste Scheme, Europe’s largest waste 
PFI project, for the Greater Manchester 
Waste Disposal Authority (‘GMWDA’), 
where we are now in the commissioning 
phase of this complex scheme. 
Costain has a strong capability in  
the waste sector and, this year, further 
strengthened its sector management 
team in order to broaden the service 
offering across the full life-cycle of 
consultancy, construction and 
maintenance of assets.
Costain has a well-established position 
in the UK water market. The Company 
has secured AMP 5 frameworks with 
Southern Water, United Utilities, Welsh 
Water, Severn Trent and Northumbrian 
Water. In addition to these long-term 
asset management contracts, Costain 
has continued successfully to design, 
secure and deliver major complex capital 
works infrastructure for the water 
industry. During the year, construction 
progressed well on the large Brighton 
and Hove waste water treatment works 
for Southern Water and the project will 
shortly move into the commissioning 
phase. On this and other projects,  
we see the potential to extend the scope  
of our work into long-term care and 
maintenance of the asset – reflecting  
the strategic broadening of our  
service offering.

We were awarded the prestigious  
A465 Heads of the Valleys contract for 
the Welsh Government, and completed 
the A40 Penblewyn to Slebech Park 
Scheme ahead of time and budget.  
We also made good progress on  
Walton Bridge, the first bridge to be  
built over the Thames in over 20 years, 
for Surrey County Council, and on the 
Harbour Way for Neath Port Talbot 
County Borough Council.
In power infrastructure, our London 
Power Tunnel Project for National Grid,  
a 33km long tunnel that will help secure 
the power supply to the capital, has 
made good progress during the year.
The Riverside Resource Recovery 
Facility (‘RRRF’) Energy from Waste 
facility at Belvedere is now operational. 
There is some outstanding work to 
complete and negotiations regarding  
the final account are ongoing.
In our airports sector, during the year  
we were awarded and delivered the 
rehabilitation of Runway 1 as part  
of our framework agreement with the 
Manchester Airport Group. For Gatwick 
Airport, we successfully completed the 
Security Improvement on its Central 
Search facility. For BAA at Heathrow,  
we have continued to deliver services 
through our existing framework and 
were awarded capital contracts on  
the airfield and within Terminal 3.
With significant Government investment 
expected over the medium and long-
term in order to improve the UK’s travel 
infrastructure, we continue to see 
exciting opportunities for growth  
in this market.
Our Highways sector saw a consistently 
strong performance throughout the  
year in which Costain reinforced its 
market leading position in Highways 
Maintenance. The Managing Agent 
Contracts (‘MAC’) service we are 
providing to the Highways Agency 
includes the operation and maintenance 
of a network in excess of one million lane 
miles, the largest of its kind in the sector. 
We also completed the strengthening of 
the M53 Bidston Moss Viaduct three 
months early and ahead of budget and 
we are making excellent progress on the 
construction of the first of the Highways 
Agency Managed Motorway Programme 
Schemes: the M1 Junction 10 to 13. 
We have an industry leading portfolio  
of Early Contractor Involvement 
Schemes with contracts for the 
Highways Agency, Welsh Government, 
Northern Ireland Road Service and 
Lancashire County Council. 
Our Rail sector enjoyed an outstanding 
performance with the award of several 
significant, long-term contracts. 
Investment in the UK’s railway 
infrastructure is expected to grow  
with £40 billion of spend committed  
over the next five years. Costain is  
now a significant player in this market. 
Proof of this was the award by Network 
Rail of the prestigious £400 million 
Thameslink London Bridge station 
redevelopment contract. Costain will 
carry out this project from design to 
delivery, and results directly from the 
broadening of our service offering 
across the full life-cycle of consulting, 
construction and care. 
We are making excellent progress  
on our contract to redevelop Reading 
station for Network Rail and the Bond 
Street station upgrade for London 
Underground. We successfully 
completed the Royal Oak Portal and 
Pudding Mill Lane Portal contracts for 
Crossrail (part of Europe’s largest 
infrastructure programme) and have, 
subsequently, been awarded significant 
further Crossrail contracts for Bond 
Street and Paddington stations.

Economic conditions in Spain remain 
very challenging, with a depressed real 
estate market and weak demand for 
development land and, consequently,  
we have scaled back land development 
activity until conditions improve.  
Our activities during the year have  
been focused on our leisure businesses 
of golf courses and our 600 berth yacht 
marina adjacent to Gibraltar. The marina 
continues to report increasing revenue 
and we expect that this will be further 
enhanced this year following the opening 
in January 2012 of a substantial dry 
dock and repair yard facility with 
75-tonne travel lift capability.

two modules to site. ‘Evap D’ will play  
a vital role in the future of Sellafield’s 
operations. This highly complex project 
is being designed, fabricated and 
constructed to exacting specifications.  
In addition, the design of the Bradwell 
Fuel Element Debris Dissolution facilities  
(part of a multi-faceted ten-year 
framework contract) is well advanced.
In power, we were selected by the 
Energy Technologies Institute to lead  
the development of a technology to 
significantly reduce the amount of CO 2 
produced by coal fired power stations. 
This will be a critical factor in the UK’s 
ability to meet its climate change targets, 
and is a further demonstration of our 
ability to design and develop innovative 
solutions which add value for  
our customers. 
In hydrocarbons and chemicals,  
we were awarded by Centrica the 
engineering, procurement and 
construction management of a major 
development at one of its key gas 
terminals. The E.ON Holford 
underground gas storage project was 
successfully completed and handed 
over. Our capabilities in the upstream  
oil and gas sector were greatly boosted  
by the acquisition of ClerkMaxwell,  
an engineering consultancy based  
in Aberdeen, which is performing well 
and providing significantly enhanced 
opportunities to win new work in this 
high-growth area. 
In nuclear process, we made further 
good progress in our various projects

Health & Safety: Providing  
a safe working environment  
free from harm
The Health & Safety of our workforce  
is of paramount importance. We are 
committed to providing a safe working 
environment, where the health and 
wellbeing of our people is both  
protected and actively promoted.
Our ongoing drive towards zero 
accidents and incidents resulted in the 
achievement of an Accident Frequency 
Rate (‘AFR’) of 0.11 in 2011, which 
represents a reduction of 27% over  
the previous year and a 35% reduction 
in the last four years.

Competence
A safe site is one where all workers  
are confident and qualified to carry  
out the tasks to which they are  
assigned. For this reason, we insist  
on a fully competent workforce  
and provide ongoing training and 
development for both our own 
employees and those of our supply 
chain partners. Our competence  
card compliance policy outlines  
our requirement for all employees  
and subcontractors to be able to 
demonstrate appropriate competence  
in Health & Safety management, 
supervisory and technical skills.
We recognise that the role of front  
line supervisors (‘FLS’) is a key  
factor in improving Health & Safety 
performance and, during 2011, an 
enhanced protocol which mandates  
the assessment of all FLS on our sites 
was developed and implemented.  
All FLS (including those working  
for our subcontractors) must meet 
Costain’s minimum standards in  
terms of competency levels,  
behaviour and attitude.
We encourage open, honest, respectful 
communication. We believe in strong,  
long-lasting relationships that are  
mutually beneficial.
However, despite our continuous 
vigilance and focus on our safety 
performance, there was a fatal accident 
involving an employee of a subcontractor 
on the Newbury Parkway project.  
Also, four Costain employees were killed 
in a fire in an accommodation facility in 
Abu Dhabi. The cause of the fire, which 
was in a facility not owned or operated 
by Costain, is still being investigated by 
the authorities. Everyone in Costain 
extends their deepest sympathies  
to the families of those involved.
Our commitment to our people and 
stakeholders is demonstrated by  
our management of Health & Safety  
and our continual drive towards zero 
accidents and incidents. We focus  
this drive on the following three areas: 
compliance, competence and culture.
Compliance
We continue to monitor performance  
on our sites and compliance with  
our systems by means of our internal 
auditing and inspection regime. Over  
the last four years, we have achieved 
consistently high standards of Safety, 
Health and Environmental (‘SHE’) 
performance across all our projects.  
We strive continually to improve our 
performance, raise our standards and 
are dedicated to promoting best practice 
across our business and industry.

32 Directors’ Report > Business review 
It is critical that our senior management 
demonstrate positive leadership with 
regard to Health & Safety issues as  
this has a direct impact on our culture 
and the creation of a safe and healthy 
working environment. To that end,  
we ran a total of 11 Health & Safety 
leadership courses, based on the 
Institute of Directors’ (‘IoD’) policy  
for Health & Safety leadership, which  
were attended by the 127 most  
senior members of our staff.
Following the overwhelming success  
of our leadership courses for our 
directors and senior managers, we will 
be targeting Health & Safety training  
for our middle management with the 
introduction of a bespoke training  
course aimed at this level of personnel.
Culture
We promote a culture where our 
managers lead by example and our 
people demonstrate personal leadership 
in Health & Safety. Our values of 
teamwork and accountability actively 
encourage our workforce to engage  
and interact with their colleagues, 
customers and supply chain partners 
alike so that we learn from one another, 
explore different ways and methods  
of working and promote best practice 
and innovation.
We continued to promote behavioural 
safety training for our workforce and 
have nominated champions amongst 
our own staff who are now competent  
to deliver the training. Our training 
system, Costain Behavioural Safety 
(‘CBS’), utilises the principles of Applied 
Behavioural Science and focuses on  
the leadership behaviours of our people, 
as well as designing and implementing 
Project Specific Implementation Plans 
that address the specific needs and 
issues of the Project.

Communities: Supporting the local 
communities in which we operate, 
ensuring we leave a lasting legacy
We recognise that the nature of our  
work can affect the communities in 
which we operate. How we manage  
our relationships and work together  
with these communities and other 
stakeholders is very important to us.  
We are committed to developing and 
maintaining excellent relations within 
local communities.
As an associate member of the 
Considerate Constructors Scheme, we 
are committed to minimising the impact 
our operations have on the community. 
We continue to receive consistently high 
scores on all our projects, achieving an 
average score, in 2011, of 35.1 out of 40 
(the average score of all sites registered 
with the scheme is approximately 31).  
In addition, our performance was also 
recognised by the receipt of 20 Awards 
from the Considerate Constructors 
Scheme, including runner up for the 
prestigious ‘Most Considerate Site’

Behavioural Safety Programme.
Providing a healthy working 
environment for all our people
The health and wellbeing of our staff  
and all other personnel engaged in work 
for us on our sites and in our offices 
remains a priority. In 2011, we continued 
to offer wellbeing medicals to our staff 
and enhanced our mandatory medical 
regime for safety critical workers.  
In addition, we ran two themed  
health campaigns across our  
business to educate our workforce  
and assist them to make informed 
choices regarding their lifestyle. 
The first campaign focused on the 
dangers and effects of drugs and 
alcohol, not only on the workers 
themselves, but also their colleagues, 
families and friends and it highlighted  
the potential implications for their 
lifestyle.
The theme of our second campaign  
was selected following an analysis of 
medicals undertaken in 2010, which 
revealed the main health issues affecting 
our workforce. It focused on promoting 
the benefits of a healthy lifestyle, with 
particular emphasis on the prevention  
of strokes, heart attacks and obesity.
We will continue to promote the health 
and wellbeing of our people who  
we consider to be our most valuable 
resource. Our existing medical regime 
will continue as will our drive to raise 
awareness of health issues and develop 
innovative ways of promoting the 
wellbeing of our workforce. 33

Developing talent
We are extremely proud of our graduate 
programme which has won external 
accolades and is accredited by seven 
professional institutions. This year saw 
the introduction of our graduate ‘boot 
camp’ aimed at consolidating our 
graduate training into a more efficient 
and effective delivery model. We are  
also successfully rebuilding a strong 
apprentice programme, with  
31 apprentices currently on level 3 
frameworks and we plan to increase 
both the numbers and types of 
apprentices in 2012. In conjunction  
with our early talent pipeline, we are 
continuing to encourage ongoing 
development with our ‘Earn while you 
Learn’ scheme and have provided 
further study to 442 employees in a wide 
variety of subjects and qualifications 
ranging from NVQs through to MBAs. 
We have a focused internal talent 
programme, which caters for the 
provision of leadership development  
for our rising stars through to a Board 
successor programme which includes 
gaining IoD professional status. 
Engaging with our employees
This year, we ran a full employee 
engagement survey and received 
valuable feedback from our workforce. 
Overall engagement was up 2%, which 
is pleasing in such challenging times.  
We are fully committed to improving  
this further with the implementation  
of a number of key actions in the areas 
of performance management, career 
development and communication.  
We introduced ‘honest conversations’ 
training for our line managers to improve 
their handling of performance reviews. 
We are improving our employee transfer 
process to ensure we can maximise 
career development opportunities 
across the whole Group and we have 
revamped the constitution of our 
Employee Consultative Committee  
to ensure it is a more effective and 
engaging two-way discussion forum.

us in delivering efficient, innovative 
and sustainable solutions
We understand the impact of our 
procurement activities and are 
committed to the responsible 
management of our supply chain and  
the economic, environmental and social 
issues within our supply chain. We ask 
our suppliers to share our values, meet 
our high standards and support us in 
delivering efficient, innovative, sustainable 
solutions. In turn, Costain is committed 
to engaging and supporting our supply 
chain to ensure compliance, continual 
improvement and the achievement  
of mutual goals.
In 2010, we introduced our Responsible 
Procurement Policy, which outlined our 
ongoing commitment to the responsible 
management of our supply chain. In 
2011, to ensure we adopted consistent 
and improving standards within our 
supply chain, the Group commenced  
the rollout of an industry recognised 
accreditation scheme, delivered by  
a reputable outsource provider, Achilles. 
To date, 59% of our preferred and 
strategic supply chain partners have 
registered with Achilles and we have  
set a target to increase this in 2012.
Throughout 2011, our relationship 
managers and supply chain sponsors 
have continued to develop and enhance 
relationships with our supply chain 
partners by holding regular business  
to business meetings and encouraging 
openness and transparency. We 
undertake regular performance  
reviews with our supply chain partners, 
discussing performance in areas  
such as supervision, competency, 
communication and teamwork, cost, 
quality and innovation, and health, safety 
and environment. In 2011, we achieved 
an average score across the Group  
of 65% with the notable success  
that 68 suppliers achieved over 80%.  
The objective is to ensure all key 
suppliers have a performance of greater 
than 50%. We also actively encourage 
360-degree feedback based on the 
criteria outlined in the performance 
reviews. This feedback is used to 
determine what either party can improve 
or change to enable mutual goals to  
be achieved.

Conserving natural resources: 
through effective waste 
management, minimising water 
consumption and sustainably 
sourcing materials
We constantly look for ways to conserve 
resources and use them more efficiently 
through good design, reducing and 
recycling waste, conserving water  
and using of sustainable materials.
Waste management
We continue to focus on waste 
management and the reduction  
of waste produced from all our activities. 
We successfully met our 2011 target, 
increasing the percentage of waste 
diverted from landfill to 89%. We are  
also pleased to report a reduction in 
tonnes of waste produced as a result  
of our activities. This has been achieved 
by careful planning of operations and 
giving due consideration to eliminating, 
reducing or reusing all potential waste 
wherever possible.

Waste diverted from landfill. 
Reducing our waste and the associated 
environmental impact is important to  
us and our customers alike and we  
will strive to ensure our performance 
improves year on year. We will continue 
to work with our customers and supply 
chain to identify solutions to eliminate 
waste via early planning and design  
and to increase opportunities for waste 
to be diverted from landfill. In 2012,  
we will target a further increase in the 
percentage of waste diverted from  
landfill and reduction in total waste  
produced compared to turnover.
Water management
Obtaining a greater understanding of 
water usage as a result of our activities  
is a key driver, in 2012 which will help us 
to target areas for reduction with greater 
efficiency. We will also assist and provide 
solutions to our customers to enable 
them to reduce their water consumption.
Sustainably sourcing materials
Working with our supply chain, we aim  
to target high impact materials and seek 
alternative, more sustainable materials 
with a lower environmental impact.  
We want to ensure we learn and share 
best practices with our supply chain.
Protecting the environment
We are committed to minimising our 
impact on the environment and reducing 
our environmental incidents year on year. 
We actively encourage the reporting of 
all environmental incidents to ensure that 
lessons learnt are shared across the 
business to prevent recurrence. In 2011, 
we saw a 36.8% reduction in reported 
environmental incidents compared  
with 2010.

and how to prevent incidents occurring 
in the first place. We are working with 
Construction Skills and other members 
of the UK Construction Confederation  
to establish a standard for environmental

industry with a view to running  
externally accredited environmental 
awareness courses. 37

Principal risks
 Risk and Impact Mitigation
Economic outlook
Uncertain outlook for the UK and global economy, 
including the extent of any changes to government 
and international regulation, taxation and interest 
rates, may impact the Group’s ability to win work 
and deliver forecast returns. The uncertain 
economic outlook also affects our customers’ 
ability and confidence to place orders, potentially 
impacting the Group’s level of opportunities. 
The Group regularly monitors the pipeline of opportunities available
and develops relationships with customers across a range of  
markets in both the private and public sectors. The Group has set  
out a clear strategy to target customers whose spending plans are
driven by national need, regulatory commitments or essential
maintenance requirements. 
Change of Government Policy on spending
Certain of the Group’s operations are dependent 
on government policy with regard to improving 
public infrastructure and services. Any reduction  
in government investment and funding would be 
likely to affect the Group’s future revenues and 
profitability adversely.
Key factors that may affect the Group strategy are kept under regular 
review by senior management and action taken where potential future 
workload shortfalls are identified.
The UK Government identified in its 2011 Autumn Statement an 
increase in infrastructure investment which will assist the Group  
in its aim to meet national needs.
Competition
The failure by the Group to compete effectively, 
resulting in a failure to win work in a competitive 
market, could reduce the Group’s revenue, 
profitability and cash flow.
The Company’s strategy of targeting customers with committed 
long-term capital and operational spending plans will enable us  
to continue to pursue and win work less affected by the downturn.  
The Company’s ongoing drive, both organically and by acquisition,  
to broaden its services across engineering consultancy, construction 
and operations and maintenance and to provide innovative cost-
effective solutions will also provide it with a competitive edge. 
Pension liabilities
The Group operates a defined benefit scheme 
which was closed to new members from  
1 June 2005 and was closed to future accrual  
on 30 September 2009. The current deficit on the 
scheme is £39.7 million net of deferred tax. If the 
market value of the scheme’s assets decline in 
relation to its assessed liabilities, the Group may 
be required to increase its cash contributions  
to cover funding shortfalls which could have an 
adverse impact on the Group’s operational results. 
The valuation under IAS 19 for the scheme as at 31 December  
2011 valued the scheme’s assets at £547.9 million and liabilities  
of £600.8 million. 
An actuarial valuation of the scheme as at 31 March 2010  
was concluded during 2010 and Costain agreed a deficit recovery 
plan with the Trustee. The next actuarial valuation is due on  
31 March 2013. 
The value of the deficit recognised in the Group’s balance sheet 
pursuant to IAS 19 is dependent on certain critical assumptions 
including mortality rates, pension increases, investment returns  
and inflation and is likely to vary from year to year.
The Company reviews the options regarding what actions Costain 
can take to mitigate its long-term risk and consults professional 
advisors, as necessary.
Acquisitions 
Failure to integrate successfully an acquired business. 
Full due diligence is carried out before any acquisition is made. 
Integration plans are put in place and managed by a dedicated team.
Strategic and Financial Risk 39
Costain Group PLC Annual Report 2011
Financial statements Other information Corporate Governance Business review Overview
 Risk and Impact Mitigation
Operational delivery 
Failure to follow Best Practice: Projects are not 
delivered to time, cost, quality or appropriate 
health and safety and environmental standards 
and therefore do not meet customers’ 
expectations. Failure to follow Company 
Standards, Policies, Procedures and Guidelines 
could adversely affect the Group’s reputation 
and/or expose the Group to financial liabilities 
and adversely affect the operational, financial 
and share price performance.
To mitigate the cost risk, experienced and qualified staff are used to 
prepare bids, which are subject to internal review and approval before 
submission. During the life of the contract, regular Project Manager’s 
Report meetings and end forecast meetings take place to discuss 
safety, progress, quality, cost, financial performance, risk, etc. 
Work on site is audited by in-house specialists and reports prepared 
so that corrective action can be taken.
Regular Health & Safety visits and on site training take place to reduce 
the risk of human error. Any breaches in procedures are reported 
quickly and acted upon as appropriate. Employees are encouraged  
to take responsibility for safety in their work areas. 
Loss of IT systems
Failure of IT systems and failure to manage and/
or integrate IT systems could cause financial 
loss to the Group and expose the Company  
to breaches of legislation and fines.
A senior executive is responsible for the IT systems and has a suitably 
qualified team in support. Critical areas are subject to testing and 
include rapid recovery as well as sound data backup procedures.
Subcontractor/supply chain and  
customer failure
If a subcontractor or supplier of goods or 
services fails financially or is responsible for late 
or inadequate delivery or below quality work it 
could damage the Group’s reputation and/or 
cause it to suffer financial losses. If a customer 
fails financially, the Group could suffer  
financial losses.
The Company seeks to ensure that it is not over-reliant on any  
one subcontractor or supplier. In addition, the Company maintains  
a list of preferred subcontractors and suppliers which is reviewed 
regularly. The Company also undertakes financial monitoring of 
subcontractors and suppliers and endeavours to maintain a dialogue 
with them in order to identify any issues or cause for concern. 
The Company focuses on targeting and working with blue-chip 
customers in sectors whose spending activity is underpinned  
by strategic national need, regulatory commitments or essential 
maintenance requirements.
People
Failure to attract, develop and retain highly 
skilled management or personnel may limit  
the Group’s ability to grow the business  
as anticipated.
The Company has in place a well developed succession planning 
process which is regularly monitored. This process includes carrying 
out ‘talent reviews’ and encouraging ongoing development at all levels. 
The Company seeks to actively engage with employees through 
engagement surveys and its Employee Consultative Committee. 
Pay and conditions of employment are also regularly reviewed  
against the prevailing market and benchmarked against competitors 
to ensure that the Company remains competitive for all levels.

Key performance  
indicators
The Group uses a range of performance 
indicators across its business units.  
These start with a formal three-year 
business plan that sets out clear  
strategic targets and objectives and  
which forms the basis of the budget  
for the following financial year.
The Board considers that the  
following Non-financial and Financial  
key performance indicators are the  
most effective measures for monitoring  
its objectives:
KPI Target 2011 2010 2009
Accident Frequency  
Rate (‘AFR’)
To continually improve 
safety performance with  
a zero tolerance approach
0.11 0.15 0.16 
Safety is the number one priority. Within the Company there  
is both a corporate and individual responsibility to ensure that 
operations are managed in a safe, healthy and environmentally 
controlled manner. The common measure in the construction 
sector for measuring safety performance is the AFR, which 
measures the number of serious workplace accidents, 
occupational diseases and specified dangerous occurrences 
reportable under the Reporting of Injuries, Diseases and 
Dangerous Occurrences Regulations 1995 per 100,000  
of hours worked. The further improvement achieved in 2011 
reflects the continued attention given to all areas of safety  
and represents upper-quartile safety performance in the 
construction sector.
Supply chain 
performance
Average key supplier 
performance score  
of greater than 50%
65% 63% 59%
The Group has a number of key suppliers and is reliant on 
their performance in carrying out its business. Consequently, 
an internal performance measurement tool is used to assess  
the performance of key suppliers on a regular basis against  
a number of indicators including Health & Safety, Programme, 
Commercial and Quality performance. The result of the 
assessment is shown as a percentage score which allows 
comparison against previous scores and other suppliers.  
The assessment and results are then used as a means  
to discuss with each supplier their performance and to put  
in place actions to improve performance or, if appropriate, 
reduce the amount of work performed using that supplier.  
In 2011, the average key supplier performance score continued 
to improve. The objective is to ensure that all key suppliers  
have a performance of at least 50%. The Group has also 
implemented an external accreditation system called Achilles 
(Building Confidence) for its strategic and preferred supply 
chain members.
Staff turnover To provide initiatives  
and working conditions  
in order to retain key staff 
7.0% 5.1% 2.9% 
The retention of staff is fundamental in delivering a quality 
service to customers. The Group undertakes a number 
of important initiatives to retain key staff, including closely 
managing their career development. Clear action plans are  
in place to address items such as customer satisfaction,  
health and safety, reward, training and development and job 
satisfaction. The Group uses a ‘voluntary leavers’ turnover  
rate to monitor staff retention. In 2011, staff retention was  
very strong compared to long-term industry norms.

Costain Group PLC Annual Report 2011
Financial statements Other information Corporate Governance Business review Overview
KPI Target 2011 2010 2009
Adjusted operating  
profit 
In line with business plan £24.1m £17.4m £22.0m
The level of adjusted operating profit (before acquisition related 
other items) is a key measure of performance for the Group. 
The measure represents the results of the operating elements 
of the Group’s performance and excludes sale of assets and 
joint ventures. The Group’s operating profit in 2011 increased  
as a result of the strong performance in the Group during  
the year. The operating profit in 2010 reduced in comparison  
to 2009 as a result of additional share based payment costs 
and a lower level of project completion bonuses.
Adjusted profit  
before tax
In line with business plan £25.5m £27.9m £18.1m
Adjusted profit before tax is a key measure for the Group and 
incorporates the interest from cash deposits held and the  
IAS 19 pension interest. The reported profit before tax in 2010 
included the significant profit of £11.2 million from the transfer  
of assets into The Costain Pension Scheme. 
Net cash balance Maintain a net cash 
balance at an appropriate 
level to suit the business 
requirements
£140.1m £144.3m £120.5m 
The Group has a positive net cash balance and close  
monitoring and measurement of cash resources is carried  
out as part of the performance measurement process.  
The reduction in the 2011 year-end cash balance compared  
to 2010 is due to expenditure in the year on two acquisitions.  
The operating cash position, excluding the acquisitions made, 
increased in the year. The average month-end cash balance  
for the Group during 2011 was £130.4 million compared  
to £116.0 million in 2010.
Order book To build a strong order 
book in line with strategy
£2.5bn £2.4bn £2.6bn
The level of secured orders on which work is to be carried  
out is a key measure for achieving continued profitability and  
growth. At the end of 2011, the order book for the Group has 
increased from the level at the start of the year, reflecting good 
contract awards during the year. 
Adjusted profit  
from operations
In line with business plan £23.6m £29.4m £20.8m
The level of adjusted profit from operations (before acquisition 
related other items) is a key measure of performance across  
all areas and divisions of the Group. The profit from operations 
for each segment of the business is reported in detail in the 
Business review section of the Annual Report. The Group’s 
profit from operations in 2011 decreased compared to 2010 
due to the significant profit of £11.2 million from the transfer  
of assets into The Costain Pension Scheme in 2010. Excluding 
this item, the profit from operations has increased on a 
like-for-like basis from £18.2 million to £23.6 million.

Group Finance Director’s review
Focused on growth 
and delivering 
shareholder value
Costain further 
strengthened its 
financial position 
during the year.  
Our stakeholders 
require us to be  
able to demonstrate 
a strong financial 
covenant, given  
our strategic  
focus on major 
customers and their 
increasingly large 
and longer-term 
contracts. 
Operating profit, before other items,  
for the year increased by 38% to 
£24.1 million (2010: £17.4 million).
Profit from operations, before other 
items, for the year was £23.6 million 
(2010: £29.4 million).
The other items referred to above relate 
to the two acquisitions completed during 
the year and are the amortisation of 
acquired intangible assets of £0.9 million 
(2010: £Nil) and employment related 
acquisition consideration of £0.7 million 
(2010: £Nil).
Profit before tax for the year ended  
31 December 2011 was £23.9 million 
(2010: £27.9 million) on revenue 
(including the Group’s share of joint 
ventures and associates) of 
£986.3 million (2010: £1,022.5 million).
Basic earnings per share amounted  
to 29.2 pence (2010: 36.4 pence  
per share). 
In 2010, a profit of £11.2 million was 
realised on the transfer of the Group’s 
interest in a portfolio of six PFI 
investments into The Costain Pension 
Scheme at an agreed valuation of 
£22.0 million.
The order book increased during the 
year to £2.5 billion (2010: £2.4 billion),  
as the Group secured a number of new 
contracts and extensions including the 
London Bridge station redevelopment 
for Network Rail, AMP 5 contracts for 
Northumbrian Water and Severn Trent, 
Evap D at Sellafield, Centrica Easington 
gas plant upgrade, A465 road upgrade 
for the Welsh Government and the 
Paddington and Bond Street Crossrail 
redevelopment projects. 
Acquisitions
In line with our strategy to expand  
the services offered to customers,  
the Group made two acquisitions  
during 2011.
In April, the Group purchased 
ClerkMaxwell, an Aberdeen based 
upstream oil and gas engineering 
company. Initial cash consideration  
was £3.2 million. Deferred cash 
consideration payments, based on  
a percentage of the notional future  
value of ClerkMaxwell on the basis  
of an 8.0 times multiple of EBITDA 
(‘Notional Future Value’), may also be 
payable shortly after completion of the 
financial years ending 31 December 
2012, 2013 and 2014. The total 
percentage of Notional Future  
Value payable over the three years 
ending 31 December 2014 is 49%  
and an element is linked to  
continued employment. 43
Costain Group PLC Annual Report 2011
Financial statements Other information Corporate Governance Business review Overview
In August, Costain acquired Promanex, 
an industrial support services business 
providing facilities management, 
installation, repair and maintenance and 
general asset management in a number 
of high-growth markets such as power, 
petrochemicals and nuclear. The 
consideration for the acquisition, 
together with management retention 
payments, was £16.2 million. In addition, 
the business was acquired with 
normalised net debt of £2.4 million. 
Interest
Net finance income amounted to 
£1.9 million (2010: £1.5 million expense).
Net interest income from bank deposits 
and other loans and receivables 
amounted to £0.1 million (2010: 
£0.1 million). In addition, the net finance 
income included the difference between 
the expected return on the pension 
scheme’s assets of £32.3 million (2010: 
£29.7 million) and the interest cost on the 
present value of the pension scheme’s 
liabilities of £30.5 million (2010: 
£31.3 million) being a net income of 
£1.8 million (2010: £1.6 million expense). 
In accordance with IAS 19, the pension 
scheme deficit position was reassessed  
as at 31 December 2011. As a 
consequence of the accounting 
reassessment, the net pension interest  
is expected to be an interest expense  
in 2012 due to the change in the  
market conditions.
Tax
The Group’s effective rate of tax was 
21.8% of profit before tax (2010: 17.2% 
which included an element of tax relief 
on the PFI asset transfer into The 
Costain Pension Scheme). There were 
benefits during the year arising from 
Research & Development tax relief 
claims, pension contributions incurred  
in 2010 but tax deductible in 2011  
and a decrease in brought forward 
temporary timing differences, being  
the utilisation of capital allowances, 
taxed provisions and tax losses.
Dividend
The Board has recommended a final 
dividend for the year of 6.75 pence per 
share (2010: 6.25 pence per share) to 
bring the total for the year to 10.0 pence 
per share (2010: 9.25 pence per share), 
an increase of 8%.
As in previous years, the Group will 
make an additional cash contribution  
to the pension scheme equal to the 
amount of dividend paid to shareholders. 
Shareholders’ Equity
Shareholders’ equity reduced  
in the year to £30.8 million (2010: 
£37.6 million). The profit for the year 
amounted to £18.7 million and  
other comprehensive expense to 
£22.6 million. The movements are 
detailed in the consolidated statements 
of comprehensive income and expense 
and changes in equity in the financial 
statements. The most significant 
element was the increase in the  
Group’s pension scheme deficit.
Pensions
As at 31 December 2011, the Group’s 
pension scheme deficit in accordance 
with IAS 19, net of deferred tax, was 
£39.7 million (2010: £28.9 million). The 
scheme deficit position has increased 
primarily as a result of a reduction in the 
discount rate, based on corporate bond 
yields, used to calculate the liabilities.
A full actuarial valuation of The Costain 
Pension Scheme (‘CPS’) was performed 
by the Scheme Actuary as at 31 March 
2010 and a recovery plan that is 
expected to eliminate the deficit over  
a period of less than ten years was 
agreed with the Trustee of the Scheme. 
This agreement, which incorporates  
the £22.0 million transfer of the PFI 
investments, resulted in a corresponding 
reduction in the Group’s future annual 
cash contributions into the scheme over 
a thirty-nine month period which started 
with effect from 1 January 2011. 
Tony Bickerstaff Group Finance Director Costain Group PLC Annual Report 2011

Group Finance Director’s reviewcontinued
The agreement also incorporates the 
ongoing commitment to match dividend 
payments with an equivalent cash 
contribution to the Scheme. 
The Group’s defined benefit pension 
scheme was closed to future accrual 
from 30 September 2009. Costain now 
operates only a defined contribution 
scheme for all employees from that date.
Since the year-end, the Board has 
agreed with the Trustee of the CPS to 
transfer the Group’s interest in a portfolio 
of two PFI investments into the CPS,  
at an agreed valuation of £20.3 million, 
which represents an effective discount 
rate of circa 7%. As a result of the 
transaction, the accounting profit 
realised on the transfer of the assets  
is £10.2 million in 2012.
Furthermore, the Group has instigated  
a liability risk management exercise.  
The Group is in the process of issuing 
Enhanced Transfer Value and Pension 
Increase Exchange offers to the 
members of the CPS. These initiatives, 
which potentially include every member 
of the CPS, will offer each individual 
greater choice and flexibility regarding 
their pension entitlement, and will also 
reduce the overall pension liabilities and 
risk remaining within the scheme. The 
level of liability reduction will depend on 
the take-up of the offer by members and 
financial conditions at the point the entire 
exercise completes (expected to be May 
2012). At this stage, it is estimated that 
the initiatives could reduce the Scheme 
liabilities by approximately £50 million, 
and could incur a one-off accounting 
cost, estimated at £6 million, to be 
expensed in 2012.
Together, the above actions are 
estimated to reduce the pension deficit 
by approximately £16 million, with an 
associated potential reduction in annual 
deficit contributions, following the next 
triennial actuarial valuation of the CPS 
which is due as at 31 March 2013.
Cash Flow and Borrowings
The Group has a strong positive net 
cash balance, which was £140.1 million 
as at 31 December 2011 (2010: 
£144.3 million) and included £1.6 million 
of borrowings (2010: £1.7 million) and 
cash held by jointly controlled operations 
of £33.6 million (2010: £33.8 million).
As set out in the consolidated cash flow 
statement, during the year, the Group  
had strong operating cash flow offset by 
investment in acquisitions and payment 
of dividends and matching pension 
deficit contributions. The average 
month-end cash balance during 2011 
was £130.4 million (2010: £116.0 million).
The cash position is affected by monthly 
and contract specific cycles and in order 
to accommodate these cyclical flows, 
the Group seeks to maintain a base 
cash balance. 
Key Risks and Uncertainties
The principal risks and uncertainties  
of the business, and the factors which 
mitigate these risks, are set out in the 
Group’s Annual Report and include the 
economic outlook, change of government 
policy on spending, competition, pension 
liabilities, operational delivery, loss of IT 
systems, supply chain and customer 
failure and people retention. The Board 
continuously assesses and monitors 
these risks and the Chairman’s 
statement, Chief Executive’s review and 
business and operations review in these 
financial statements include consideration 
of uncertainties affecting the Group.
Accounting policies and significant 
areas of judgment and estimation
A summary of the significant accounting 
policies of the Group is set out in the 
Notes to the financial statements.  
There has been no significant change  
to the accounting policies in the year and 
there is no material effect on the financial 
statements of new accounting standards 
adopted in the period.
The Notes to the financial statements 
also include the significant areas  
of judgment and estimation used in 
preparation of the financial statements.
The most critical accounting policies  
and significant areas of judgment and 
estimation arise from the accounting  
for defined benefit pension schemes 
under IAS 19 Employee benefits, the 
accounting for long-term contracts 
under IAS 11 and assessments  
of the carrying value of land, property, 
goodwill and intangible assets.
Contract Bonding and  
Banking Facilities
The Group’s long-term contracting 
business is dependent on it being  
able to supply performance and other 
bonds as necessary. This means 
maintaining adequate facilities from 
banks and surety bond providers to 
meet the current and projected usage 
requirements. During 2011, the Group 
renegotiated its contract bonding and 
banking facilities with its relationship 
banks and surety companies. The 
facilities were increased to £465 million 
and extended to a maturity date  
of 30 September 2015. 45

Financial statements Other information Corporate Governance Business review Overview
Going Concern
The Directors have acknowledged the 
guidance ‘Going Concern and Liquidity 
Risk: Guidance for Directors of UK 
Companies 2009’ published by the 
Financial Reporting Council in October 
2009. The Directors have considered  
the Group’s financial requirements,  
its current order book and future 
opportunities and its available bonding 
facilities. Having reviewed the latest 
projections, including the application  
of reasonable downside sensitivities,  
the Directors believe that the Group  
is well placed to manage its business  
risks successfully despite the  
current uncertain economic outlook. 
Accordingly, the Group continues  
to adopt the going concern basis  
in preparing these financial statements. 
Treasury 
The Group’s treasury and funding 
activities are undertaken by a centralised 
treasury function. Its primary activities 
are to manage the Group’s liquidity, 
funding and financial risk, principally 
arising from movements in interest rates 
and foreign currency exchange rates. 
The Group’s policy is to ensure that 
adequate liquidity and financial 
resources are available to support the 
Group’s growth development, while 
managing these risks. The Group’s 
policy is not to engage in speculative 
transactions. Group Treasury operates 
as a service centre within clearly defined 
objectives and controls and is subject  
to periodic review by internal audit.
Liquidity Risk
The Group finances its operations 
primarily by a mixture of working capital, 
funds from shareholders and retained 
profits. The Directors regularly monitor 
cash usage and forecast usage to 
ensure that projected financing needs 
are supported by adequate cash 
reserves or bank facilities.
Foreign Currency Exposure
Translation exposure: the results of the 
Group’s overseas activities are translated 
into sterling at rates approximating to  
the foreign exchange rates ruling at the 
dates of the transactions. The balance 
sheets of overseas subsidiaries and 
investments are translated at foreign 
exchange rates ruling at the balance 
sheet date.
Transaction exposure: the Group has 
transactional currency exposure arising 
from subsidiaries’ commercial activities 
overseas and, where appropriate, the 
Group requires its subsidiaries to use 
forward currency contracts to minimise 
any currency exposure unless a natural 
hedge exists elsewhere within  
the Group.
Interest Rate Risks and Exposure
The Group holds financial instruments 
for two main purposes: to finance its 
operations and, currently only within its 
PFI investments, to manage the interest 
rate risks arising from its operations  
and its sources of finance. Various 
financial instruments (for example, trade 
receivables and trade payables) arise 
directly from the Group’s operations. 
With the Group’s cash balances and low 
level of borrowings, the main exposure 
to interest rate fluctuations within the 
Group’s operations arises from surplus 
cash, which is generally deposited with 
the Group’s relationship banks. Within 
the investments in joint ventures and 
associates, interest rate movements  
will affect the value of swaps classified 
as cash flow hedges and this will  
impact the Group’s equity.

The Group has a strong 
positive net cash balance, 
which was £140.1 million

David Allvey
Chairman 
Dear Shareholder
We believe that great companies are built 
on the foundation of trust. By providing 
open and transparent information, 
together with strong compliance with 
both the spirit and letter of the law, 
trust is earned by managing the business 
in a responsible and sustainable way.
At Costain, we are committed to robust governance practices and accountability. 
As we mentioned in our 2010 Annual Report, this year, we are complying with the 
new disclosure requirements as set out in the UK Corporate Governance Code 
2010. These principles are considered to be central to the effective management 
of the business and to maintaining the confidence of the investors.
During the year, the Board has made considerable progress on a number 
of different issues, which are detailed within the Governance report. We have 
also taken part in an externally facilitated independent Board evaluation.
Our Board is responsible for providing strong leadership for the Costain Group. 
Effective leadership is realised through collaboration between the Board and 
the Executive team and my role as Chairman is to ensure that we harness the 
experience and knowledge of the Directors and drive a culture of continual 
improvement in standards, decision-making, policies and accountability.
Governance goes well beyond the boardroom. At Costain, we operate with 
diligence and discipline across the whole business and believe it is important 
to assess continually how we do things. Encouraging dialogue with stakeholders 
helps to guide and shape our approach to governance and risk management.
We continually monitor the composition of the Board to ensure we have the 
right level of skills and expertise. The Directors have a strong understanding 
of our business and sector and bring valuable insight and experience to the table.
Our Board is ultimately responsible for the success of Costain and we are 
committed to the highest standards of corporate governance that will enable 
us to achieve our vision of becoming one of the UK’s top engineering 
solutions provider.

Achievements of 2011
Board and Committees
The role of the Board
The Group is controlled through its 
Board. The Board’s main role is to create 
long-term value for shareholders by 
providing entrepreneurial and prudent 
leadership of the Company, setting the 
Company’s strategic aims, ensuring 
that the necessary financial and other 
resources are available and that the 
appropriate controls are in place 
to deliver these objectives.
Who is on the Board?
The Board currently comprises two 
executive directors and five non-
executive directors of whom one 
is the Chairman, three are independent 
non-executive directors (one being the 
Senior Independent Director) and one 
is a nominee non-executive director. 
The nominee non-executive director 
is nominated by our major shareholder, 
Mohammed Abdulmohsin Al-Kharafi 
& Sons WLL. 
A list of the individual directors 
and their biographies are set out 
on pages 46 to 47. The biographies 
illustrate that the non-executive directors 
have a range of business and financial 
experience that is important and relevant 
to the management of the Company. 
The Board believes that there is an 
appropriate balance between executives 
and non-executives and that this 
balance is enhanced by the varying 
lengths of service of the non-executive 
directors, which are depicted in the 
chart on page 52. 
The Board recognises the importance 
of greater diversity (not just gender 
specific) in the boardroom and 
throughout the business. The Board 
aims to have a broad range of skills, 
backgrounds and experience whilst 
following a policy of ensuring we appoint 
the best people. Within this context 
and as part of the ongoing process 
of refreshing the Board, the Company 
will continue to encourage and welcome 
interest from candidates drawn from 
a diverse background, who will add 
to the Board’s diversity.
What has the Board done during the year?
Set out below is a summary of the key matters undertaken 
by the Board in 2011:
Strategic 
discussions 
and investment
The Board devoted increased time to deeper 
and broader discussions on key strategic issues 
and took part in a number of Board workshops 
focused on strategy over a three-year cycle. 
These workshops were attended by members 
of the Executive Board. The Board has also 
facilitated more opportunities for informal Board 
discussions on strategic issues. The Board 
has engaged in some significant strategic 
developments during the year, including the 
acquisitions of ClerkMaxwell and Promanex.
Monitoring risk
The Board has assessed the effectiveness 
of the Group’s reporting controls and ensured 
that the Group’s risk profile reflects the 
Company’s strategic objectives.
Visits
The Board attended senior leadership team 
gatherings and visited a number of sites across 
the country to ensure directors maintain 
an understanding of the operational issues 
that affect the Group. 
Training
The Audit Committee discussed the Company’s 
response to the Bribery Act 2010 and all 
Board members undertook training in this 
area. The Board has also overseen the updating 
of the Company’s Ethical Business Conduct 
Policy, PLC Board and Committee Procedures 
Policy and Share Dealing Code.
Evaluation
The Board took part in an externally facilitated 
independent Board evaluation. Further details 
of the external evaluation can be found 
on page 53.
Corporate 
Responsibility (‘CR’)
The Board developed a more strategic approach 
to CR with the launch of ‘Costain Cares’. 
The Company now has a dedicated CR Director 
and monitors progress on a regular basis.  Costain Group PLC Annual Report 2011
52 Directors’ Report > Corporate Governance
At the time of his original appointment 
in January 2008, the Chairman of the 
Company was considered independent 
by the Board. However, in accordance 
with the Code, the ongoing test of 
independence is not appropriate 
in relation to the Chairman. 
The Company complies with the 
requirement under provision B.1.2 
of the Code that at least half of the 
Board, excluding the chairman, 
should comprise non-executive 
directors determined by the Board 
to be independent, notwithstanding 
that this requirement is waived in 
respect of smaller companies such 
as the Company being a member 
of the FTSE SmallCap index.
Conflicts
The Company has procedures in 
place for managing conflicts of interest. 
The Board has satisfied itself that there 
is no compromise to the independence 
of the directors who have appointments 
on the boards of, or relationships with, 
other companies. The Board requires 
directors to declare all appointments 
which could result in a possible 
conflict of interests and has adopted 
appropriate processes to manage and, 
if appropriate, approve any such conflict.
Appointments to the Board and 
retirement of directors
The membership of the Board and 
biographical details of the executive 
and non-executive directors are 
given on pages 46 to 47.
The appointment and replacement of 
directors is governed by the Company’s 
Articles of Association, the Code, the 
Companies Act 2006 and related 
legislation. The Articles of Association 
may be amended by a special resolution 
of the Company’s shareholders.
Length of service: 
Non-executive directors
as at 31 December 2011
5+ years
2-5 years
0-2 years
Independence
The Board considers each of its 
independent non-executive directors 
to be independent in character and 
judgment and there are no relationships 
or circumstances which are likely to 
affect (or could appear to affect) the 
judgment of such non-executive 
directors, notwithstanding that in 
the case of Mr Bryant, the Senior 
Independent Director, he has served 
on the Board for more than nine years.
By the date of the 2012 Annual 
General Meeting, Mr Bryant, the Senior 
Independent Director, will have served 
on the Board for ten years and, as a 
result, his continued independence has 
been the subject of particular scrutiny. 
The Nomination Committee has given 
detailed consideration to Mr Bryant’s 
independence. Mr Bryant continues 
to demonstrate excellent stewardship 
as Senior Independent Director. 
As a result of his length of service and 
commitment, he provides an in-depth 
knowledge of the Group that is 
invaluable to the Board. Accordingly, 
the Board takes the view that Mr Bryant 
has retained independence of character 
and judgment and this has not 
diminished over the period of his tenure. 
The Nomination Committee continues 
to review succession on a regular basis 
and is currently working with an external 
search consultant with a view to possible 
new appointment(s) in the future. 
The Company’s Articles of Association 
require that all directors, including 
nominee non-executive directors, 
should be subject to election by 
shareholders at the first opportunity 
after their appointment and to re-election 
thereafter at intervals of no more than 
three years. The Company’s Articles 
of Association also provide that non-
executive directors who have served for 
longer than nine years should be subject 
to annual re-election. Accordingly, the 
aforementioned provisions of the 
Company’s Articles of Association 
comply with provision B.7.1 of the 
Code, as applicable to smaller 
companies below the FTSE 350. 
In accordance with the Company’s 
Articles of Association and provision 
B.7.1 of the Code, Mr Allvey, Mr Bryant 
and Mr Wyllie will retire by rotation 
at the next Annual General Meeting 
and offer themselves for re-election. 
The Chairman and independent 
non-executive directors all have 
terms and conditions of appointment, 
which are available for inspection 
during normal business hours 
at the Company’s registered office. 
An independent non-executive director’s 
appointment is for an initial period 
of three years, at the expiry of which 
time, the appointment is reviewed to 
determine whether the appointment 
should continue. Mohammed 
Abdulmohsin Al-Kharafi & Sons WLL 
and the other major shareholder York 
Place Limited, a subsidiary of UEM 
Builders Berhad, are each entitled to 
appoint a non-executive director for 
so long as those shareholders each 
hold 7% of the aggregate nominal value 
of the then issued ordinary share capital 
of the Company. York Place Limited has 
not taken advantage of this option since 
4 December 2009. In consequence, the 
Company did not comply with provision 
B.2.3 of the Code, which requires that 
all non-executive directors should 
be appointed for a specific term 
and be subject to re-election.

How often does the Board meet?
The Board holds scheduled meetings 
throughout the year and meets on 
an ad hoc basis both physically and 
by telephone conference as required. 
During 2011, the Board met formally 
on eight occasions. Details of the 
attendance at Board meetings in 2011 
are given in the table below:

Mr S G Younis attended four out

throughout the year due to other work 
commitments. Mr S G Younis regularly 
attended board meetings held on an 
ad hoc basis.
How do we make sure our Board 
is effective?
The Board has established a formal 
process for the evaluation of the 
performance of the Board and its 
principal committees. In 2011, in 
accordance with best practice, the 
Board commissioned an independently 
facilitated Board and Committee review. 
The review was conducted by SCT 
Consultants Ltd and each director 
completed a questionnaire and was 
interviewed individually on a confidential 
basis. The review forms part of the 
regular evaluation and development 
work conducted by the Board to ensure 
it continues to improve its overall 
effectiveness and built on the previous 
evaluation conducted by SCT 
Consultants in 2009. The outputs 
of this external Board and Committee 
evaluation have begun to inform the 
Board’s action planning for 2012-2013.
During the year, Mr Allvey met with 
the non-executive directors without 
the executive directors being present 
and, as part of the process to appraise 
Mr Allvey’s performance, the Senior 
Independent Director met with the 
non-executive directors without the 
Chairman being present. 
On appointment, the directors take part 
in an induction programme, pursuant to 
which they receive information about the 
Group, the role of the Board and the 
matters reserved for its decision, the 
terms of reference and membership of 
the principal Board committees and the 
powers delegated to the committees, 
the Group’s corporate governance 
practices and procedures, and the latest 
financial information about the Group.
As regards the continuing professional 
development of the executive and 
non-executive directors, Board members, 
independent of any formal training 
arranged by the Company, are 
encouraged to attend seminars and 
conferences on issues relevant to their 
appointment as directors of a public 
company, particularly matters concerned 
with corporate governance, audit and 
remuneration issues. In addition, Board 
offsite visits are considered essential to 
ensure that directors have a thorough 
understanding of the business operations 
and issues that affect the Group.

In order to discharge their duties, the 
directors are provided with full and 
timely access to papers prior to Board 
meetings and the directors are free 
to seek any further information they 
consider necessary. In addition, 
between Board meetings, non-executive 
directors have access to the Chief 
Executive, Group Finance Director and 
Company Secretary in order to progress 
the Company’s business. The non-

report from the Chief Executive, monthly 
management accounts, certain internal 
audit reports and regular management 
reports and information, which enable 
them to scrutinise the Group’s and its 
management’s performance against 
agreed objectives.
All Board members have access to all 
information relating to the Group and 
have access to the advice and services 
of the Company Secretary (who is 
responsible for ensuring that Board 
procedures are followed) and who 
is also the Company’s Legal Director. 
The appointment and removal of the 
Company Secretary is a matter reserved 
for Board approval. The Board also 
obtains advice from professional 
advisors as and when required 
at the expense of the Group.
The Group’s organisation and structure 
is established and overseen by the 
Board and designed to allow effective 
decision-making and to meet corporate 
governance standards. A diagram 
illustrating the structure is shown on 
page 53. The Board has established 
committees which are responsible for 
audit, remuneration, and succession. 
Each committee plays a vital role in 
helping the Board ensure high standards 
of corporate governance are maintained 
throughout the Group. The committees 
are governed by terms of reference 
which are reviewed annually and can 
be viewed in the corporate governance 
section of the Company’s website. 
The membership of each of the Board 
committees is detailed as follows.
The Group Executive Committee 
(the Executive Board) is accountable 
for running the business and delivering 
the Group strategy. It consists 
of the executive directors and other 
senior managers and is chaired by 
Andrew Wyllie (Chief Executive) and

Group’s performance;
•	 monitoring the effectiveness of the 
external audit process and making 
recommendations to the Board

Non-audit services
The Audit Committee monitors the 
non-audit services being provided 
to the Group by its external auditors, 
and has developed a formal policy 
on the provision of non-audit services 
by the external auditors to check this 
does not impair their independence 
or objectivity, and that the Group 
maintains a sufficient choice of 
appropriately qualified audit firms. 
The policy sets out four key principles 
that underpin the provision of non-audit 
services by the external auditors: 
The auditors should not audit their 
own firm’s work; make management 
decisions for the Group; have a 
mutuality of financial interest with 
the Group; or be put in the role of 
advocate for the Group. 
Prior approval of the Audit Committee 
is required for any services provided by 
the external auditors where the fee is 
likely to be in excess of £25,000. The 
Audit Committee reviews all services 
being provided by the external auditors 
annually to review the independence and 
objectivity of the external auditors, taking 
into consideration relevant performance 
and regulatory requirements so that 
those are not impaired by the provision 
of permissible non-audit services. 
In 2011, KPMG performed a high level 
of non-audit services in respect of 
completed and aborted acquisitions 
and providing tax services. KPMG were 
selected as the most cost-effective and 
efficient supplier to undertake these 
services based on their thorough 
understanding of the Group and 
their particular expertise. The Audit 
Committee approved the provision 
of these services in advance and were 
satisfied that the non-audit services 
have not impacted on KPMG’s 
objectivity and independence.

Remuneration Committee is set out

on pages 63 to 70.
Relationship with institutional 
investors and private investors 
The Company remains committed to 
maintaining good relationships with both 
institutional and private shareholders. 
There continues to be regular dialogue 
with institutional investors and brokers.  
At the time of the announcement  
of the full year and half-year results, 
presentations are made to brokers’ 
analysts, the press and institutional 
investors. In addition, there are meetings 
with analysts, financial journalists and 
institutional investors throughout the year.
The Chairman is available to discuss 
strategy and governance issues with 
shareholders and Mr Bryant, as the 
Senior Independent Director, is available 
to shareholders if they have concerns 
that have not been, or cannot be, 
addressed through the Chairman.
The Company obtains feedback from  
its brokers, Investec, on the views of 
institutional investors on a non-attributed 
basis. As a matter of routine, the Board 
reviews at each meeting a report from  
its brokers on issues relating to recent 
share price performance, trading activity 
and institutional sentiment. The Board 
also receives copies of relevant analysts’ 
reports on an ad hoc basis. 
The Board regards the Annual General 
Meeting as an important opportunity  
to communicate directly with 
shareholders. Board members,  
including the Chairmen of the 
Remuneration, Nomination and  
Audit Committees attended the 2011 
meeting and propose attending the 
forthcoming meeting and will be 
available to answer questions.
Shareholders may raise issues or 
concerns by contacting the Group’s 
Investor Relations team via the email 
address stated on the Company’s 
website or by writing to the  
Company Secretary. 
Internal controls and  
risk management
Review of internal controls
The Board is responsible for the Group’s 
system of internal controls and for 
reviewing its effectiveness. Such a 
system, however, can only manage 
rather than eliminate the risk of failure  
to achieve business objectives and  
can only provide reasonable, but not 
absolute, assurance against material 
misstatement or loss.
The Board maintains full control over 
strategic, financial, operational and 
compliance issues. Management  
of the Group is delegated to the Chief 
Executive, who is assisted by members 
of the Executive Board. The Chief 
Executive has full authority to act subject 
to the matters reserved to the Board and 
to the requirements of Group policies.
The Board confirms that there is  
an ongoing process for identifying, 
evaluating and managing the significant 
risks faced by the Group, which has 
been in place for the year under review 
and up to the date of approval of the 
Annual Report. This process extends 
not only to projects undertaken solely  
by subsidiaries of the Group but  
also to projects undertaken in joint 
arrangements and by joint ventures  
and associates. This process is reviewed 
by the Audit Committee on behalf  
of the Board and accords with the  
Turnbull guidance.
The Audit Committee has reviewed  
the effectiveness of the system of 
internal controls. The review covered  
all controls, including financial, 
operational and compliance controls  
and risk management.
Risk management
The Company has various procedures 
for identifying and managing risk, 
including a prequalification and pre-
tender review for obtaining approval  
to bid for a project from the Executive 
Investments Committee and a specific 
project risk management procedure 
which involves a continuous review  
of risks by the project manager and 
commercial manager of the project 
following contract award.
The Company has established a 
Corporate Risk Register, as well as, 
sector business Risk Registers, which 
are monitored and updated regularly. 
The Board and Audit Committee  
receive reports on the Company’s  
main corporate risks and opportunities.  
As recommended by the Code, the 
Board has determined the nature and 
extent of the significant risks it is willing 
to take in achieving strategic objectives. 
For the duration of a contract, the Risk/
Opportunity Registers are updated on a 
monthly basis and the top five risks and 
opportunities reviewed by Group senior 
management. Internal Audit conducts 
site reviews and circulates reports with 
further follow-up actions and 
inspections.
The risk management strategy is 
regularly reviewed and the Group’s risks 
and opportunities compared against 
those of blue-chip companies. Internal 
Audit provides independent assurance 
that risks inherent to the Company’s 
business processes are reasonably 
controlled and assists management  
in assessing those risks and how 
effectively they are managed by internal 
controls. Internal Audit also promotes 
best practice in risk management 
processes to ensure delivery  
of corporate objectives.
In 2011, Internal Audit conducted  
project and departmental reviews to 
appraise and report on the effectiveness 
of the risk management processes.  
All reviews carried out were subject  
to appropriate follow up action, which 
revisits areas previously subject  
to audit and provides assurance  
that accepted recommendations  
have been implemented effectively.  
The overall assessment is that a strong 
risk management culture is continuing  
to develop within the Group.
The Board also assesses the 
effectiveness of the Company’s 
reporting controls to ensure that  
the Group’s risk profile reflects its 
strategic objectives.

Operational Controls
Controls and procedures are  
detailed in Group Policy Statements, 
procedure manuals and other written 
instructions, which are reviewed and 
updated regularly. 
 
The Company has developed 
operational management systems that 
are accredited to ISO 9001:2000 which 
are designed to support management  
in providing safe construction processes 
of the highest quality. Implementation 
and compliance with the management 
system is monitored and audited by 
Internal Audit. In order to maintain the 
Company’s accreditation, external  
audits of the management systems  
are undertaken twice yearly by the 
British Standards Institution. 
Each Project Manager completes 
monthly reports, which include 
information on Safety, Health and 
Environmental statistics, cash flow, 
value, cost and profit, claims and 
variations, risk management, progress 
and staffing levels. All projects  
operate within a controlled framework  
of best practice, Safety, Health and 
Environmental guidelines. The project 
management team monitors and the 
Safety, Health and Environmental 
advisers audit, compliance with  
and execution of the guidelines.
The Board and Executive Board  
receive regular reports at on Safety, 
Health and Environmental performance 
and significant operational matters.  
The Executive Board is responsible  
for ensuring compliance with Company 
procedures. The Chief Executive is the 
Board member responsible for Health  
& Safety.
Financial controls
There is a comprehensive annual 
budgeting system, linked to the annual 
strategy review, for each business within 
the Group. The budget for the following 
year is reviewed and finalised by the 
Executive Board, alongside the three 
year Business Plan, before final  
approval by the Board in December.
The Company produces a monthly 
rolling forecast update for the current 
year which is compared with the annual 
budget. Each operation’s performance  
is reviewed monthly by management 
and reported against budget to the 
Board and Executive Board. The reports 
cover profit and loss and cash flow with 
an accompanying narrative on significant 
issues underlying the financial reports. 
The Group Treasurer and Group 
Taxation Manager report to the Audit 
Committee, via the Finance Director, on 
any issues of significance to the Group.
Compliance
The Group’s policies contain a statement 
on business conduct, emphasising  
the legal, ethical and moral standards 
that must be employed in all of the 
Company’s business dealings.  
This statement is regularly reviewed  
and updated as appropriate to ensure 
compliance with any change in 
legislation, for example, the Bribery  
Act 2010. The Company expects the 
highest standards from all employees 
and key suppliers.
In the event of a critical legal issue,  
a legal report is submitted to the Board. 
An annual review of all litigation valued 
above £50,000 is submitted to, and 
reviewed by, the Board. Significant legal 
and regulatory changes are notified to 
the appropriate staff and training given 
where necessary.
The Chairman of the Audit Committee 
reports the outcome of the Audit 
Committee meetings to the Board  
and all Board members receive the 
minutes of all Audit Committee meetings. Costain Group PLC Annual Report 2011

in 2011, allowing the Company to understand how employees 
feel about Costain. In December 2011, the Company also 
launched ‘ask.costain.com’, enabling employees to get 
involved in two-way communication with the Company.  Costain Group PLC Annual Report 2011
60 Directors’ Report > Corporate Governance
The Company has an established Employee Consultative 
Committee which convenes biannually and on an ad hoc  
basis throughout the year, to discuss matters impacting the 
business, in order that the views of employees can be taken 
into account in making decisions likely to affect their interests.
Share schemes are an established part of our reward 
package, encouraging and supporting employee share 
ownership; in particular, employees currently participate  
in the Company’s Save As You Earn Scheme plan. 
Diversity and Inclusion
The Company is an inclusive employer and promotes equality 
and inclusion from recruitment and selection, through training 
and development, and promotion to retirement. We are  
fully committed to the elimination of unlawful and unfair 
discrimination and we value the differences that a diverse 
workforce brings to the organisation. It is Company policy that 
people with disabilities should have full and fair consideration 
for all vacancies. Wherever possible, we endeavour to 
interview those people with disabilities who fulfill the minimum 
criteria, and to retain employees in the workforce if they 
become disabled during employment and to provide specialist 
training where appropriate. We support our supply chain and 
encourage their active commitment to our approach on 
equality and inclusion.
Our customers are looking to us to provide local employment 
and skills, and to facilitate inclusion on our projects. We 
continue to work with the UK Contractors Group to deliver an 
Equality and Diversity Action plan across Costain and to apply 
local solutions to diversity issues on projects. We assist our 
customers in their employment and skills agenda by delivering 
an Apprentice Development Programme and through 
establishing National Skills Academies.
Policy and practice on payment of suppliers
As a result of the nature of the Group’s business, the 
contractual relationships with suppliers of goods and services 
and with subcontractors vary according to circumstances and 
type of supplier or subcontractor. It is the Group’s policy to 
enter into an appropriate form of contractual agreement on 
payment terms when agreeing the terms of each transaction 
and to pay according to those terms. The Group does not 
follow any particular code or practice for the payment of 
creditors. In practice, the Group makes every effort to pay 
accordingly when it can be confirmed that the supplier has 
provided the goods or services in accordance with the relevant 
terms of the contract. The amount for trade creditors of the 
major subsidiary trading companies represents 46 (2010: 43) 
days of average daily purchases. The Company has no trade 
creditors (2010: None).
Significant agreements – change of control 
The directors are not aware of any significant agreements  
to which the Company and/or any of its subsidiaries or 
associates are a party that take effect, alter or terminate  
upon a change of control of the Company following a takeover 
bid, save in respect of the Facility Agreements relating to the 
Company’s banking and surety bonding facilities, which would 
terminate upon a change of control. There are no agreements 
between the Company and its directors or employees 
providing for compensation for loss of office or employment 
that occurs because of a takeover bid except that provisions  
of the Company’s share schemes and plans may cause 
options and awards to be granted to employees under  
such schemes and plans to vest on a takeover. 
Essential contracts or other arrangements
Given the scope and diversity of the Company’s activities,  
the Company does not consider that it has contractual  
or other arrangements which are essential to the business  
of the Group and which are required to be disclosed.
Research and development
The Group is involved in research and development in all 
sectors in which it operates but specifically in highways, rail, 
airports, nuclear, hydrocarbons and chemicals, waste and 
water. The Group’s engineers and technical staff in these 
named sectors develop and deliver technical advances, 
processes and innovations in an effort to achieve practical, 
integrated solutions that incorporate the most advanced 
technologies, while taking account of the broader regulatory 
perspective and seek to resolve all scientific and technological 
uncertainties. In undertaking certain elements of this  
research and development work, the Group is supported  
by arrangements with certain British universities.
Donations
Charitable donations of £135,424 (2010: £94,565) were  
made by the Group during the year, principally to industry 
related charities serving the communities in which the  
Group operates. 
No political donations were made during the year ended  
31 December 2011 (2010: None). The Company has  
a policy of not making donations to political organisations.

Disclosure of information to auditors 
The directors who held office at the date of approval of this 
report confirm that, so far as they are each aware, there is  
no relevant audit information of which the Company’s external 
auditors are unaware; and each director has taken all the steps 
that he ought to have taken as a director to make himself 
aware of any relevant audit information and to establish that 
the Company’s external auditors are aware of that information.
This confirmation is given and should be interpreted in 
accordance with the provisions of Section 418 of the 
Companies Act 2006.
Auditors
KPMG Audit Plc has expressed its willingness to continue in 
office as independent auditor of the Company and a resolution 
to reappoint will be proposed at the forthcoming Annual 
General Meeting.
Directors’ Indemnity
Costain Group PLC maintains liability insurance for its  
directors and offices. There are no subsisting indemnities  
in favour of directors.
Directors’ responsibilities
The directors’ responsibilities for the financial statements 
contained within this Annual Report and the directors’ 
confirmations required under DTR 4.1.12 are set out  
on page 71.
Voting Rights
Every member and every duly appointed proxy present at a 
general meeting or class meeting has, upon a show of hands, 
one vote and every member present in person or by proxy 
has, upon a poll, one vote for every share held by him. In the 
case of joint holders of a share, the vote of the senior who 
tenders a vote, whether in person or by proxy, shall be 
accepted to the exclusion of the votes of the other joint holders 
and, for this purpose, seniority shall be determined by the 
order in which the names stand in the register in respect  
of the joint holding.
Restrictions on voting
No member shall be entitled to vote at any general meeting  
or class meeting in respect of any share held by him if any  
call or other sum then payable by him in respect of that share 
remains unpaid or if a member has been served with a 
restriction notice (as defined in the Articles of Association)  
after failure to provide the Company with information 
concerning interests in those shares required to be  
provided under the Companies Act 2006.
The Company is not aware of any agreement between holders 
of securities that may result in restrictions of voting rights. 
Dividends and other distributions
The Company may by ordinary resolution from time to time 
declare dividends not exceeding the amount recommended  
by the Board. Subject to the Companies Act 2006, the Board 
may pay interim dividends, and also any fixed rate dividend, 
whenever the financial position of the Company, in the opinion 
of the Board, justifies its payment. If the directors act in good 
faith, they are not liable for any loss that shareholders may 
suffer because a lawful dividend has been paid on other 
shares which rank equally with or behind their shares.
The Board may withhold payment of all or any part of any 
dividends or other monies payable in respect of the Company’s 
shares from a person with a 0.25% interest in a class of the 
Company’s shares if such a person has been served with a 
restriction notice after failure to provide the Company with 
information concerning interests in those shares required  
to be provided under the Companies Act 2006.
Variation of rights
Subject to the Companies Act 2006, rights attached to any 
class of shares may be varied with the written consent of the 
holders of not less than three-fourths in nominal value of the 
issued shares of that class (calculated excluding any shares 
held as treasury shares), or with the sanction of a special 
resolution passed at a separate general meeting of the holders 
of those shares. At every such separate general meeting 
(except an adjourned meeting), the quorum shall be one or 
more persons holding or representing by proxy not less than 
one-third in nominal value of the issued shares of the class 
(calculated excluding any shares held as treasury shares).  
The rights conferred upon the holders of any shares shall  
not, unless otherwise expressly provided in the rights attaching 
to those shares, be deemed to be varied by the creation  
or issue of further shares ranking pari passu with them.
Amendment of Articles of Association
Unless expressly specified to the contrary in the Articles  
of Association of the Company, the Company’s Articles  
of Association may be amended by a special resolution  
of the Company’s shareholders. 
Appointment and replacement of directors
The directors shall be not less than two and not more  
than 18 in number. The Company may by ordinary resolution 
vary the minimum and/or maximum number of directors.
A director shall not be required to hold any shares in the 
Company but is encouraged to do so by the introduction of 
new share ownership guidelines. Directors may be appointed 
by the Company by ordinary resolution or by the Board.  
A director appointed by the Board holds office only until the 
next Annual General Meeting of the Company and is then 
eligible for reappointment. The Board, or any committee 
authorised by the Board, may from time to time appoint one  
or more directors to hold any employment or executive office 
for such period and on such terms as they may determine  
and may also revoke or terminate any such appointment. Costain Group PLC Annual Report 2011
62 Directors’ Report > Corporate Governance 
Other statutory information continued
At every Annual General Meeting of the Company, any director 
who has been appointed by the Board since the last Annual 
General Meeting, or who held office at the time of the two

than employment or executive office, for a continuous period 
of nine years or more at the date of the meeting, shall retire 
from office and may offer himself for reappointment  
by the members. 
The Company may by special resolution remove any director 
before the expiration of his period of office. The office of a 
director shall be vacated if: (i) he resigns or offers to resign  
and the Board resolves to accept such offer; (ii) his resignation 
is requested by all of the other directors and all of the other 
directors are not less than three in number; (iii) he is or has 
been suffering from mental or physical ill health and the Board

Companies Act 2006 and any directions given to the 
Company by special resolution, the business of the Company 
will be managed by the Board who may exercise all the 
powers of the Company, whether relating to the management 
of the business of the Company or not. In particular, the Board 
may exercise all the powers of the Company to borrow money,

Directors’ remuneration report
This report, approved by the 
Board, has been prepared 
in accordance with the 
requirements of the UKLA 
listing rules, the Companies 
Act 2006, the UK Corporate 
Governance Code and best 
practice guidelines.
A resolution to approve the Directors’ remuneration report 
will be proposed at the AGM.
Remuneration Committee
The Remuneration Committee (the Committee) is comprised 
exclusively of independent non-executive directors. 
The members of the Committee are Michael Alexander 
(Chairman), John Bryant and James Morley. 
In 2011, the Committee met seven times and details of the 
attendance at those meetings are as follows: 
Director A B
M R Alexander (Chair) 7 7
J M Bryant 7 7
J Morley 7 6
A Maximum number of meetings the director could have attended
B Number of meetings the director actually attended 
To assist the Committee in ensuring that the Company’s 
remuneration practices take due account of market and best 
practice, the Committee has access to experienced specialist 
independent consultants. During the year, the Committee took 
advice, as appropriate, from Aon Hewitt Limited (operating 
through the brand New Bridge Street). This advice related 
to developing its remuneration policy, particularly in relation 
to (i) the production of bespoke benchmarking data in 
respect of the remuneration of executive directors and 
senior management and (ii) the design of the proposed 
new Long-Term Incentive Plan and SAYE Plan for which 
shareholder approval is to be sought at the forthcoming 
AGM (further details of which are set out below).
Neither Aon Hewitt Limited, nor any other part of the Aon 
Corporation Group, provided other services to the Company 
during the year.
In addition, advice was sought where appropriate from other 
sources, namely the Chief Executive, Group Finance Director, 
the Company’s Chairman and the HR & Legal Director. 
The Company Secretary acts as secretary to the Committee. 
The Committee may invite any of the executive directors to 
attend all or part of its meetings. Individuals are not present 
when their own remuneration is being discussed.
The Committee’s terms of reference are available on the 
Company’s website at www.costain.com or from the 
Company Secretary. Copies of the letters appointing 
the Committee’s advisers can be obtained from the 
Company Secretary.

Remuneration policy
The Committee determines the remuneration policy 
for executive directors, the Chairman and other senior 
management with the aim of attracting, motivating and 
retaining executives of the appropriate calibre and expertise, 
so that the Company is managed successfully for the benefit 
of its stakeholders.  Costain Group PLC Annual Report 2011
64 Directors’ Report > Corporate Governance 
Directors’ remuneration report continued
Each year, the Committee reviews the remuneration policy, 
taking into account both the external market (including 
environment, social and corporate governance issues) and the 
Company’s strategic objectives over the short and the medium 
term. The framework has been designed as an integral part 
of the Company’s overall business strategy. 
The remuneration package is based on the following principles:
Principle How achieved Rationale
To provide 
competitive and 
appropriate total 
remuneration
Target levels of 
remuneration are 
independently 
benchmarked 
against comparable 
companies primarily 
in the UK-based 
construction sector 
and of other 
companies of 
a similar size
To attract and 
retain executives 
of the appropriate 
calibre and 
expertise
Reward both 
short and 
long-term 
performance
Ensure an 
appropriate balance 
between short and 
long-term through 
mixture of incentive 
programmes
Focuses 
executives on the 
long-term strategy 
of the Company 
and so motivates 
executives to make 
decisions that lead 
to the creation of 
long-term value, 
while avoiding 
any incentive for 
undue risk taking
Link remuneration 
practices to 
strategy of the 
Company
Regularly review 
performance metrics 
used in short and 
long-term incentive 
programmes and 
the use of cash 
and equity
The chart below illustrates the average mix between 
the fixed and variable (performance-related) elements of 
remuneration of the executive directors at target and maximum 
performance. Target performance assumes target payouts 
of cash and DSBP and an expected value of LTIP awards. 
Maximum performance assumes all bonuses and long-term 
incentive awards vest in full. It demonstrates the weighting of 
the package towards variable pay, particularly at maximum 
performance. The Committee considers the mix between 
fixed and variable pay to be appropriate. During the year, 
the Committee reviewed the executive remuneration 
arrangements from a risk perspective and concluded 
that they do not encourage undue risk and that the 
arrangements, as a whole, provide an appropriate balance.

External directorships
The Company encourages executive directors to take up 
external non-executive appointments, with the prior consent 
of the Company, in the belief that such appointments broaden 
their skills and the contribution which they can make to the 
Company’s performance. Generally, no more than one such 
appointment may be undertaken. There must be no conflict of 
interest and the time devoted to the external appointment must 
be reasonable in relation to the individual’s commitment to the 
Company. Fees paid for external appointments may be 
retained by the individual concerned.
Mr Wyllie was appointed a non-executive director of Scottish 
Water on 7 April 2009 and in respect of the appointment for 
the year ended 31 December 2011 he was paid £19,872 
(2010: £19,872). He has retained these fees in accordance 
with the above policy.
Remuneration arrangements for executive 
board directors
Remuneration packages for executive directors and 
other members of senior management consist 
of the following elements:
•	 Base salary;
•	 Benefits;
•	 Pension;
•	 Annual cash bonus;
•	 Deferred share bonus; and
•	 Long-term incentives.

Costain Group PLC Annual Report 2011
Financial statements Other information Corporate Governance Business review Overview
Base salary
Base salaries for the executive directors are reviewed annually 
by the Committee and take effect from 1 April. The Committee 
also gives guidance to the Chief Executive as to the matters 
being taken into account in the salary review of other senior 
management and all other employees of the Group. The 
Company’s policy is to target broadly the median position in 
light of remuneration generally within the Company and other 
companies in the UK-based construction sector. Salaries are 
set with reference to individual performance, experience 
and responsibilities.
For 2012, the Committee approved a 2% increase for 
executive directors, resulting in the base salaries being 
payable as set out in the above table. A 2% salary increase 
budget was also applied across the Company in 2012.
Other Benefits
The non-salary benefits for executive directors comprise:
•	 Company car or car allowance;
•	 Fuel;
•	 Medical insurance; and
•	 Life assurance.
Pensions
Under their terms of engagement, the executive directors are 
entitled to an annual pension allowance of 22% of base salary.
Life assurance cover of four times base salary is provided 
through the Costain Life Assurance Scheme. The annual 
premiums payable in respect of life assurance for Messrs 
Wyllie and Bickerstaff were £1,867 (2010: £1,811) and 
£1,237 (2010: £1,190) respectively. 
The Group offers a Group Flexible Retirement Plan which 
was set up in 2009 with Standard Life for employees and 
senior management. Neither executive director participated 
in the scheme.
Annual cash bonus
Executive directors and other senior management are 
eligible for annual cash bonuses to encourage improved 
performance, with targets established by the Committee 
to align rewards with the Company strategy. The targets are 
set at the beginning of the year by the Committee and are 
reviewed with appropriate input from the Audit Committee 
at the end of the year. For the year ended 31 December 2011, 
the Chief Executive and Group Finance Director each had 
a maximum bonus opportunity of 100% of base salary. 
For the year ended 31 December 2011, 90% of the executive 
directors’ annual bonus metrics were set as measurable key 
financial targets. These metrics included Group earnings 
before interest and tax, Group overhead costs, cash flow, 
order book and health and safety targets. The remaining 
10% was linked to personal goals relating to building and 
developing the Executive team and the talent pool within 
the organisation. 
The total bonus payment for the executive directors for the 
year ended 31 December 2011 was 85% of salary of which 
75% related to measurable financial targets and 10% related 
to personal goals.
For the year ended 31 December 2012, the maximum annual 
cash bonus potential for the Chief Executive and the Group 
Finance Director remains unchanged, with the same basic 
approach to target-setting (i.e. 90% relating to key financial 
targets, 10% relating to personal goals). 
Deferred Share Bonus Plan
Executive directors and other senior management are eligible 
to participate in the Company’s DSBP which promotes greater 
alignment with shareholders through the award of deferred 
shares. Under the DSBP, any bonus earned is deferred in 
shares which vest on the second anniversary of grant, subject 
to continued employment and not being under notice of 
termination (either given or received) on the date of vesting. 
Shares to satisfy the deferred bonuses are purchased by 
a trust on behalf of the Group and so do not lead to any 
dilution of shareholder interest. 
For the year ended 31 December 2011, both executive 
directors had a maximum DSBP opportunity of 50% of base 
salary. The performance measure was EBIT, as described 
in the table below: 
Group EBIT 
for 2011
Percentage of Relevant 
Maximum Award
£19.47 million or less 0% 
Between £19.47 million 
and £20.5 million
Between 0% and 60% 
on a straight-line basis
£20.5 million 60% 
Between £20.5 million 
and £22.55 million
Between 60% and 100% 
on a straight-line basis
£22.55 million or more 100% 
The EBIT for the year ended 31 December 2011 was 
£22.0 million and so the measure has been met as to 89%. 
The number of shares to which a participant in the DSBP 
will be entitled will be calculated on the basis of the monetary 
value of the deferred bonus divided by the middle market 
quotation of a share at the date of the deferred award. 
The grant of the deferred bonus award will be made 
in the six weeks following the preliminary announcement 
of the results for the financial year ended 31 December 2011.
For the year ended 31 December 2012, the maximum 
DSBP for the executive directors remains unchanged. The 
Committee will disclose on a retrospective basis the EBITA 
measure (defined as underlying earnings before interest, tax, 
amortisation of acquired intangible assets and employment 
related acquisition consideration but excluding any PFI transfer 
into the pension and risk management costs) for 2012 in next 
year’s report.  Costain Group PLC Annual Report 2011
66 Directors’ Report > Corporate Governance 
Directors’ remuneration report continued
The DSBP includes a mechanism to allow the Company 
to deliver the DSBP awards in a tax-efficient manner at no 
additional cost to the Company by delivering to participants 
a combination of HM Revenue & Customs (‘HMRC’) tax-
approved market value share options over a fixed number of 
shares and non-tax approved share options with a nil exercise 
price over a fixed value of shares. The tax approved and 
non-tax approved options are linked, in terms of value and 
on exercise and mirror the same commercial terms as a DSBP 
award. An advantage of this combined arrangement is that it 
allows for greater tax efficiencies for both the participant and 
the Company. 
For 2012 onwards, the Committee will introduce a clawback 
provision incorporated into the annual cash bonus and the 
DSPB with regard to any material misstatement to audited 
accounts, an error in calculation of targets resulting in 
an overpayment, gross misconduct or criminal behaviour 
on the part of a participant. 
Long-Term Incentive Plans
The current LTIP was approved by shareholders at the 2002 
AGM which means that the current plan reaches the end of 
its ten-year life in 2012. During 2011, the Committee reviewed 
proposals for a new plan and will seek shareholder approval 
for a new 2012 LTIP at the AGM in 2012. Full details of the 2012 
LTIP (which has been designed to reflect many of the core 
features of the current LTIP) are set out in the Notice of AGM.
The current LTIP allows for conditional awards to a participant 
with a maximum face value of up to 100% of base salary 
at the date of grant of the award.
The EPS targets for the 2011 awards are:

* EPS targets rounded as appropriate. 
The Committee believes that EPS is the most appropriate 
metric to use in the LTIP, as growth in EPS is one of the key 
drivers of the Company’s share price together with operating 
profit. As reported last year, for awards made in 2011 EPS 
should be calculated before pension interest (itself calculated 
under IAS 19). 
The performance conditions that are intended to apply to the 
first awards to be made under the 2012 LTIP are described 
in the Notice of AGM.
The Remuneration Committee is committed to the concept 
of creating a genuine alignment of interests between investors 
and the Costain Board. The Committee therefore welcomed 
the significant increases in Mr Wyllie and Mr Bickerstaff’s 
shareholdings during 2011 and has further aligned the interests 
of executives and investors by introducing a share ownership 
guideline under which executive directors will be encouraged 
to build up and maintain a shareholding worth not less than 
100% of base salary. Executives and other senior managers 
will be encouraged to retain up to 50% of the net number of 
shares received under any 2012 LTIP or future DSBP award 
until this guideline is satisfied. Furthermore, to ensure a true 
alignment of interests across the entire Board, a similar share 
ownership guideline has been introduced for non-executive 
directors who will be encouraged to build up and maintain 
a shareholding of not less than 100% of their annual fee.
All employee share plans
The Company’s existing SAYE Plan was approved by 
shareholders at the 2002 AGM. Again, this means that 
it will expire in 2012. Consequently, shareholder approval 
will be sought for the establishment of a new 2012 SAYE Plan 
(which will be of standard design) at the forthcoming AGM.
Under the current Plan, the Company granted options 
on 11 October 2011 at an option price of 205p per share to 
participants in the 3 year saving scheme, and 182p per share 
to participants in the 5-year saving scheme. Details of the 
grants made under the Plan are shown in Note 19 to the 
financial statements on page 111.
Service agreements and letters of appointment
The executive directors have service contracts that can 
be terminated by either party on the giving of 12 months’ 
notice. There is no provision for payment of predetermined 
compensation in case of wrongful termination by the Group 
and the duty to mitigate loss applies. 
Mr Wyllie’s service agreement is dated 25 April 2005 and 
Mr Bickerstaff’s 3 March 2006. 
Chairman and other non-executive directors
Remuneration for non-executive directors, other than 
the Chairman, is determined by the Board, following 
consultation between the Chairman and the Chief Executive. 
The Chairman’s fee is determined and recommended to the 
Board following consultation between the Committee and the 
Chief Executive. Fees are reviewed annually and any increase 
is effective from 1 April. 67
Costain Group PLC Annual Report 2011
Financial statements Other information Corporate Governance Business review Overview
Remuneration for non-executive directors, other than the 
Chairman, comprises a basic annual fee for acting as non-
executive director of the Company and additional fees for the 
Senior Independent Director, and chairmanship of the Audit 
and Remuneration Committee. Following a review in 2012, 
it was decided to increase the basic annual fees and the 
additional fees, reflecting the increased time commitment 
expected of non-executive directors and the expertise that 
they bring to the Company. The fees are:
Year

2012 £41,820 £6,120 £8,670 £6,120 
2011 £41,000 £6,000 £8,500 £6,000
During 2011, the Chairman was paid fees of £127,000. 
He does not receive any additional fees for committee 
memberships. For 2012, he will receive a fee of £129,500.
The independent non-executive directors have letters of 
appointment. The appointment of an independent non-
executive director can be terminated by reasonable notice 
on either side. Messrs Allvey, Alexander, Bryant and Morley 
are not entitled to compensation for loss of office. 
The nominee non-executive directors (as indicated in the 
Corporate Governance Statement on page 52), hold office 
for as long as the shareholder nominating them holds a 
specific percentage of the issued share capital. The nominee 
non-executive directors are required to stand for re-election 
in the usual way and are not entitled to compensation for loss 
of office. Currently, only one of the two major shareholders 
has appointed a nominee to sit on the Board.
The dates of each non-executive directors’ original 
appointment are as follows:

for £100 invested in Costain Group PLC on 1 January 2007 
compared with the value of £100 invested in the FTSE 
SmallCap Index. While the FTSE All-Share Index has been 
used for this purpose in previous reports, the Committee now 
believes that the SmallCap Index is a more appropriate Index 
to use as it is the Index in which the Company is a constituent 
and comprises companies of a more similar size to Costain 
than the FTSE All-Share.

The value of the shares under the Combined Deferred Award and the Option are equal. The Combined Deferred Award and 
the Option must normally be exercised at the same time. When calculating the maximum value of the shares under a Deferred 
Award that may be granted under the terms of the Plan, the value of the shares under the Option is not counted.
All of the awards will become exercisable on the second anniversary of the date of grant subject to the continued employment 
of the participant. The value of the shares delivered under the Combined Deferred Award on exercise is the same as the value 
of the shares under that award at the time of grant. The number of shares under the Deferred Award and Option at grant will 
be delivered to the participants on exercise.
To the extent that all or any part of an Award becomes exercisable, it remains exercisable until the tenth anniversary of the date 
of grant.

Financial statements Other information Corporate Governance Business review Overview
Directors’ responsibilities statement
The directors are responsible 
for preparing the Annual Report 
and the Group and parent 
company financial statements 
in accordance with applicable 
law and regulations.
Company law requires the directors to prepare the Group and 
parent company financial statements for each financial year. 
Under that law, they are required to prepare the Group 
financial statements in accordance with IFRSs as adopted  
by the EU and applicable law and have elected to prepare  
the parent company financial statements on the same basis. 
Under company law, the directors must not approve the 
financial statements unless they are satisfied that these give  
a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the Group and 
parent company and of their profit or loss for that period.
In preparing each of the Group and parent company financial 
statements, the directors are required to:
•	 select suitable accounting policies and then apply  
them consistently;
•	 make judgments and estimates that are reasonable  
and prudent;
•	 state whether they have been prepared in accordance  
with IFRSs as adopted by the EU; and
•	 prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis 
unless it is inappropriate to presume that the Group and the 
parent company will continue in business.
The directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting 
records that are sufficient to show and explain the parent 
companies’ transactions and disclose with reasonable 
accuracy at any time the financial position of the parent 
company and enable them to ensure that its financial 
statements comply with the Companies Act 2006. They have 
general responsibility for taking such steps as are reasonably 
open to them to safeguard the assets of the Group and  
to prevent and detect fraud and other irregularities.
Under applicable law and regulations, the directors are also 
responsible for preparing a Directors’ Report, Directors’ 
remuneration report and Corporate Governance statement  
that comply with that law and those regulations.
The directors are responsible for the maintenance and  
integrity of the corporate and financial information included  
on the Company’s website. Legislation in the UK governing  
the preparation and dissemination of financial statements  
may differ from legislation in other jurisdictions.
We confirm that to the best of our knowledge:
•	 the financial statements for the year ended 31 December 
2011, prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted  
by the EU, give a true and fair view of the assets, liabilities, 
financial position and profit or loss of the Company and  
the undertakings included in the consolidation taken  
as a whole; and
•	 the Directors’ Report, the Business review, the Principal risks 
and Key Performance Indicators and the Group Finance 
Director’s review sections of this report include a fair review 
of the development and performance of the business and 
the position of the Company and the undertakings included 
in the consolidation taken as a whole, together with a 
description of the principal risks and uncertainties that  
they face.

in accordance with the provisions of the Companies Act 2006.
This report is made solely to the Company’s members,  
as a body, in accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the 
Companies Act 2006. Our audit work has been undertaken  
so that we might state to the company’s members those

by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility to anyone 
other than the Company and the Company’s members,  
as a body, for our audit work, for this report, or for the  
opinions we have formed.
Respective responsibilities of directors and auditors
As explained more fully in the Directors’ Responsibilities 
Statement the directors are responsible for the preparation  
of the financial statements and for being satisfied that they  
give a true and fair view. Our responsibility is to audit and 
express an opinion on, the financial statements in accordance 
with applicable law and International Standards on Auditing 
(UK and Ireland). Those standards require us to comply with 
the Auditing Practices Board’s (‘APB’s’) Ethical Standards  
for Auditors.
Scope of the audit of the financial statements
A description of the scope of an audit of financial  
statements is provided on the APB’s website at  
www.frc.org.uk/apb/scope/private.cfm.
Opinion on financial statements
In our opinion:

then ended;

as regards the Group financial statements, Article 4  
of the IAS Regulation.

Act 2006
In our opinion:
•	 the part of the Directors’ remuneration report to be audited 
has been properly prepared in accordance with the 
Companies Act 2006; 
•	 the information given in the Directors’ report for the financial 
year for which the financial statements are prepared  
is consistent with the financial statements; and
•	 information given in the Corporate Governance statement 
with respect to internal control and risk management 
systems in relation to financial reporting processes and 
about share capital structures is consistent with the  
financial statements.
 
Matters on which we are required to report  
by exception
We have nothing to report in respect of the following:
Under the Companies Act 2006 we are required to report  
to you if, in our opinion:
•	 adequate accounting records have not been kept by the 
parent company, or returns adequate for our audit have  
not been received from branches not visited by us; or
•	 the parent company financial statements and the part  
of the Directors’ remuneration report are not in agreement 
with the accounting records and returns; or
•	 certain disclosures of directors’ remuneration specified by 
law are not made; or
•	 we have not received all the information and explanations 
we require for our audit; or
•	 a Corporate Governance statement has not been prepared 
by the Company.
 
Under the Listing Rules we are required to review: 
•	 the directors’ statement, set out in the Directors’ Report,  
in relation to going concern; and
•	 the part of the Corporate Governance Statement relating  
to the Company’s compliance with the nine provisions  
of the UK Corporate Governance Code specified for our 
review; and
•	 certain elements of the report to shareholders by the Board 
on director’s remuneration.

Costain Group PLC Annual Report 2011
Financial statements Other information Corporate Governance Business review Overview
1 General information
Costain Group PLC (‘the Company’) is a public limited 
company incorporated in the United Kingdom. The address of 
its registered office and principal place of business is disclosed 
on the last page of this Annual Report. The principal activities 
of the Company and its subsidiary undertakings (collectively 
referred to as ‘the Group’) are described in the Business 
review section of these financial statements.
The consolidated financial statements of the Company for the 
year ended 31 December 2011 comprise the Group and the 
Group’s interests in associates, jointly controlled entities and 
jointly controlled operations. The parent company financial 
statements present information about the Company as  
a separate entity and not about its Group.
The financial statements were authorised for issue by the 
directors on 7 March 2012.
2 Summary of significant accounting policies
Both the Company financial statements and the Group 
consolidated financial statements have been prepared and 
approved by the directors in accordance with International 
Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the EU  
(‘Adopted IFRS’) and their related interpretations. On 
publishing the parent Company financial statements here 
together with the Group financial statements, the Company  
is taking advantage of the exemption in Section 408 of the 
Companies Act 2006 not to present its individual income 
statement and related notes that form a part of these  
approved financial statements.
Basis of preparation
These financial statements are presented in Pounds sterling, 
rounded to the nearest hundred thousand. The financial 
statements are prepared on the historical cost basis, except 
that financial assets and derivative financial instruments are 
stated at their fair value as required by IFRS.
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with  
IFRS requires management to make judgments, estimates  
and assumptions that affect the application of policies and 
reported amounts of assets and liabilities, income and 
expenses. The estimates and associated assumptions are 
based on historical experience and various other factors that 
are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the 
results of which form the basis of making the judgments about 
carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily 
apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from 
these estimates. Judgments made by management in the 
application of IFRS that have a significant effect on the financial 
statements and estimates with a significant risk of material 
adjustment in the next year are discussed later in this Note.
Notes to the financial statements
Going concern 
The Group’s business activities and the factors likely to affect 
its future development, performance and position are set out 
in the Business review section of these financial statements. 
The financial position of the Group, its cash flows, liquidity 
position, borrowing and bonding facilities, use of financial 
instruments and hedging activities, exposure to credit risk and 
its objectives, policies and processes for managing its capital 
and financial risk are described in the Financial review section 
of these financial statements and in Note 16.
The Group’s principal business activity involves long-term 
contracts with a number of customers, mainly across the 
United Kingdom. To meet its day-to-day working capital 
requirements, it uses cash balances provided from 
shareholders’ capital and retained earnings. As part of its 
contracting operations, it is sometimes required to provide 
performance and other bonds. It satisfies these requirements 
by utilising its committed bonding facilities from banks and 
surety companies. These facilities have financial covenants, 
including a profit-based one, which are tested quarterly. 
The directors have acknowledged the guidance ‘Going 
Concern and Liquidity Risk: Guidance for Directors of UK 
Companies 2009’ published by the Financial Reporting 
Council in October 2009. The directors have considered  
these requirements, the Group’s current order book and  
future opportunities and its available bonding facilities.  
Having reviewed the latest projections, including the 
application of reasonable downside sensitivities, the directors 
believe that the Group is well placed to manage its business 
risks successfully despite the current uncertain economic 
outlook. Accordingly, they continue to adopt the going  
concern basis in preparing these financial statements.
Accounting policies
The accounting policies set out below have, unless  
otherwise stated, been applied consistently by the Group  
and the Company to each period presented in these  
financial statements.
Following the acquisitions of ClerkMaxwell Ltd and  
Promanex Group Holdings Ltd, IFRS 3 ‘Business 
combinations’ is applicable for the first time.
The following standards and interpretations are effective  
for the year ended 31 December 2011 but are not material  
to the Group:
•	 Amendments to IFRS 1 ‘First-time Adoption of International 
Financial Reporting Standards’ 
•	 Amendments to IFRS 2 ‘Share-based payment’ 
•	 Amendments to IAS 32 ‘Financial Instruments: presentation’
•	 IFRIC 15 ‘Agreements for the Construction of Real Estate’ 
•	 IFRIC 19 ‘Extinguishing financial liabilities with equity 
instruments’   Costain Group PLC Annual Report 2011
82 Financial statements
2 Summary of significant accounting policies 
continued
Basis of consolidation
(a)  The Group’s financial statements include the financial 
statements of the Company and subsidiaries controlled  
by the Company. Control exists where the Company  
or one of its subsidiaries has the power, directly or indirectly, 
to govern the financial and operating policies of an entity so  
as to obtain benefits from its activities. In assessing control, 
potential voting rights that presently are exercisable are 
taken into account. The financial statements of subsidiaries 
are included in the consolidated financial statements  
from the date that control commences until the date  
that control ceases.
(b)  Associates are operations over which power exists to 
exercise significant influence but not control, generally 
accompanied by a share of between 20% and 50% of the 
voting rights. Associates are accounted for using the equity 
method. If the share of losses equals the investment,  
no further losses are recognised, except to the extent that 
there are amounts receivable that may not be recoverable 
or further commitments to provide funding.
(c)  Jointly controlled entities are those joint ventures where 
control is shared with another entity, established by 
contractual agreement. Jointly controlled entities are 
accounted for using the equity method from the date  
that the jointly controlled entity commences until the date 
that joint control of the entity ceases. If the share of losses 
equals the investment in the entity, no further losses are 
recognised, except to the extent that there are amounts 
receivable that may not be recoverable or further 
commitments to provide funding.
(d)  The presentation in the statement of financial position in 
respect of investments in associates and jointly controlled 
entities restricts the minimum carrying value to £Nil. Where 
the cost of investment is negative, due to losses incurred, 
then an amount equal to the negative position is applied to 
any outstanding loan balance with the investment or, where 
future funding commitments exist, a provision is made up  
to the value of the commitment. Transfers of any excess 
losses are shown within reclassifications in Note 13.
(e)  Jointly controlled operations are those joint ventures over 
which joint control exists, established by contractual 
agreement, which are not legal entities. Where a jointly 
controlled operation exists, then the Group entity involved 
records the assets it controls, the liabilities and expenses  
it incurs and its share of income. Such jointly controlled 
operations are reported in the consolidated financial 
statements on the same basis. Transactions between 
Group companies and jointly controlled operations  
eliminate on consolidation.
(f)  Intra-group balances and transactions together with any 
unrealised gains arising from intra-group transactions  
are eliminated in preparing the consolidated financial 
statements. Unrealised gains arising from transactions with 
associates, jointly controlled entities and jointly controlled 
operations are eliminated to the extent of the interest in the 
entity or operation. Unrealised losses are eliminated in the 
same way as unrealised gains, but only to the extent that 
there is no evidence of impairment.
Currency translation
Transactions in foreign currencies are translated at the 
exchange rate ruling at the date of the transaction. Monetary 
assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are 
translated to Pounds sterling at the exchange rate ruling  
at the statement of financial position date. Foreign exchange 
differences arising on translation are recognised in the  
income statement. 
The assets and liabilities of foreign operations, including 
goodwill and fair value adjustments, are translated to  
Pounds sterling at exchange rates ruling at the statement  
of financial position date. The revenues and expenses of 
foreign operations are translated to Pounds sterling at rates 
approximating to the exchange rates ruling at the dates  
of these transactions.
Exchange differences arising from the translation of the net 
investment in foreign operations and of related hedges are 
recognised directly in equity and those that have arisen since  
1 January 2004, the date of transition to IFRS, are presented 
as a separate component of equity. Cumulative exchange 
differences are released into the income statement upon 
disposal. Translation differences that arose before the date  
of transition to IFRS in respect of all foreign operations  
are not presented as a separate component.
Revenue recognition
Revenue is measured at the fair value of the consideration 
received or receivable, net of value added tax and includes  
the share of revenue of jointly controlled operations. Most  
of the Group’s revenue arises from construction contracts. 
(a) Construction contracts
Revenue arises from increases in valuations on contracts. 
Where the outcome of a construction contract can be 
estimated reliably and it is probable that the contract will  
be profitable, revenue and costs are recognised by reference 
to the stage of completion of the contract activity at the 
statement of financial position date. Stage of completion  
is assessed by reference to the proportion of contract  
costs incurred for the work performed to date relative  
to the estimated total costs, except where this would  
not be representative of the stage of completion.
When it is probable that total contract costs will exceed  
total contract revenue, the expected loss is recognised  
as an expense immediately.
Notes to the financial statements continued 83
Costain Group PLC Annual Report 2011
Financial statements Other information Corporate Governance Business review Overview
2 Summary of significant accounting policies 
continued
Revenue recognition continued
(a) Construction contracts continued
Variations and claims are included in revenue where it is 
probable that the amount, which can be measured reliably,  
will be recovered from the customer. When the outcome of  
a construction contract cannot be estimated reliably, contract 
revenue is recognised to the extent of contract costs incurred 
where it is probable those costs will be recoverable. Contract 
costs are recognised as expenses in the period in which they 
are incurred.
Construction work in progress is stated at cost plus profit 
recognised to date less a provision for foreseeable losses  
and less amounts billed and is included in amounts due from 
customers for contract work. Cost includes all expenditure 
related directly to specific projects and an appropriate 
allocation of fixed and variable overheads based on normal 
operating capacity. Amounts valued and billed to customers 
are included in trade receivables. Where cash received from 
customers exceeds the value of work performed, the amount 
is included in credit balances on long-term contracts.
(b) Other revenue
Revenue from the sale of goods is recognised when the 
significant risks and rewards of ownership of the goods  
have been transferred to the buyer, the amount of revenue  
can be measured reliably and it is probable that the economic 
benefits associated with the transaction will flow to the Group.
Revenue from services is recognised when the service  
is provided.
Revenue in respect of property development sales is 
recognised on the transfer to the buyer of the significant risks 
and rewards of ownership. This is typically achieved when the 
legal title is transferred. If at the time that the sale reaches legal 
completion there remains infrastructure works to complete,  
the nature and extent of the Group’s continuing involvement  
is assessed to determine whether it is appropriate to recognise 
revenue. Where the conditions for revenue recognition are  
met, an appropriate amount is recognised. Amounts deferred  
in respect of infrastructure works are only recognised when 
such works are substantially complete.
Rental income is recognised in the income statement on a 
straight-line basis over the term of the lease. Lease incentives 
are recognised as an integral part of the total rental income  
on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease.
Pre-contract costs
Costs associated with bidding for contracts are written off as 
incurred. When it is probable that a contract will be awarded, 
usually when preferred bidder status is secured, costs incurred 
from that date to the date of financial close are carried forward 
in the statement of financial position and included in amounts 
due from customers for contract work.
When financial close is achieved on PFI contracts, costs are 
recovered from the special purpose vehicle and pre-contract 
costs within this recovery that were not previously capitalised 
are credited to the income statement. When an interest  
in a special purpose vehicle is retained and that interest  
is accounted for as an associate or joint venture, the credit  
is recognised over the life of the construction contract  
to which the costs relate.
Research and development
Costs classified as relating to research and development 
activities are expensed as incurred.
Goodwill and other intangible assets
Goodwill arising on acquisitions represents the excess of  
the fair value of the consideration over the identifiable assets, 
liabilities and contingent liabilities of the acquired entity and 
goodwill arising on the acquisition of subsidiaries is included  
in non-current assets. The attributable costs of acquisitions 
are expensed to the income statement. 
Goodwill is reviewed annually for impairment and is carried at 
cost less accumulated impairment losses. Goodwill is included 
when determining the profit or loss on subsequent disposal of 
the business to which it relates.
Other intangible assets comprise acquired intangible assets: 
customer relationships, order book and brand and computer 
software. Customer relationships and other intangibles 
acquired are measured at the present value of cash flows 
attributable to the relationship less an appropriate contributory 
asset charge. Computer software is carried at cost; 
subsequent expenditure is capitalised only when it increases 
the future economic benefits embodied in the specific asset  
to which it relates, otherwise expenditure is expensed  
as incurred.
Amortisation begins when an asset is acquired or, in the case 
of computer software, available for use and is calculated  
on a straight-line basis to allocate the cost of the assets  
over their estimated useful lives. 
Property, plant and equipment
Property, plant and equipment is carried at cost less 
accumulated depreciation and impairment losses. Where  
parts of an item of property, plant and equipment have 
different useful lives, they are accounted for as separate items. 
Cost comprises purchase price and directly attributable costs. 
Freehold land is not depreciated. For all other property, plant 
and equipment, depreciation is calculated on a straight-line 
basis to allocate cost less residual values of the assets over 
their estimated useful lives as follows: 
Freehold buildings  50 years 
Leasehold buildings  Shorter of 50 years or lease term 
Plant and equipment Remaining useful life  
   (generally 3 to 10 years)
The assets’ residual values and useful lives are reviewed  
and adjusted, if appropriate, at each statement of financial 
position date. Costain Group PLC Annual Report 2011

Investments – Company
Company investments in subsidiaries are carried at cost less 
impairment losses less any pre-acquisition dividends received.
PFI investments
The Group has interests in PFI investments held through joint 
ventures and associates. These arrangements, whereby  
a private sector operator participates in the development, 
financing, operation and maintenance of infrastructure for 
public services, are accounted in accordance with IFRIC 12. 
Under this interpretation, the infrastructure assets within the 
Group’s investments are recognised as financial assets 
because the operator has an unconditional right to receive  
a specified amount of cash or other financial asset over the life 
of the agreement. The operator recognises investment income 
in respect of the financial asset on an effective interest basis. 
  
Impairment of non-financial assets
For the purposes of impairment testing, goodwill is allocated  
to each of the cash generating units expected to benefit from 
the synergies of the combination. Cash generating units to 
which goodwill has been allocated are tested for impairment 
annually, or more frequently when there is an indication that 
the unit may be impaired, If the recoverable amount of the 
cash generating unit is less than the carrying amount of the 
unit, the impairment loss is allocated first to reduce the 
carrying amount of any goodwill allocated to the unit and  
then to other assets of the unit pro-rata on the basis of the 
carrying amount of each asset in the unit. An impairment loss 
recognised for goodwill is not reversed in a subsequent period.
The carrying amounts of other assets, except inventories  
and deferred tax assets, are reviewed at each statement  
of financial position date to determine whether there is any 
indication of impairment. If any such indication exists, the 
assets recoverable amount is estimated.
An impairment loss is recognised whenever the carrying 
amount of an asset, or its cash-generating unit, is less than  
the recoverable amount. Impairment losses are recognised  
in the income statement.
An impairment loss is reversed if there has been a change  
in the estimates resulting in the recoverable amount rising 
above the impaired carrying value of the asset. An impairment 
loss is reversed only to the extent that the carrying amount  
of the assets does not exceed the carrying amount that would  
have been determined, net of depreciation or amortisation,  
if no impairment loss had been recognised.
Provisions
A provision is recognised in the statement of financial position 
when there is a legal or constructive obligation as a result  
of a past event and it is probable that an outflow of economic 
benefits will be required to settle the obligation. If the effect  
is material, provisions are determined by discounting the 
expected future cash flows at a pre-tax rate that reflects 
current market assessments of the time value of money  
and, where appropriate, the risks specific to the liability. 
A provision for onerous contracts is recognised when the 
expected benefits to be derived from a contract are lower  
than the unavoidable cost of meeting the obligations  
under the contract.
Taxation
The tax expense represents the sum of United Kingdom 
corporation tax and Overseas tax currently payable and 
Deferred tax.
The tax currently payable is based on the taxable profit for the 
year. Taxable profit differs from profit before tax as reported  
in the income statement because it excludes items of income 
or expense that are taxable or deductible in other years and  
it further excludes items that are never taxable or deductible. 
The liability for current tax is calculated using tax rates and 
laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted  
by the statement of financial position date.
Deferred tax is the tax expected to be payable or recoverable 
on differences between the carrying amounts of assets and 
liabilities in the financial statements and the corresponding  
tax bases used in the computation of taxable profit and is 
accounted for using the statement of financial position liability 
method. Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised for all 
temporary differences except for those specific exemptions  
set out below and deferred tax assets are recognised to the 
extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be 
available against which deductible temporary differences  
can be utilised. The carrying amount of deferred tax assets  
is reviewed at each statement of financial position date.  
Such assets and liabilities are not recognised if the temporary 
difference arises from the initial recognition of goodwill or other 
assets and liabilities, other than in a business combination,  
in a transaction that affects neither the taxable profit nor the 
accounting profit.
Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for temporary differences 
arising on investments in subsidiaries and interests in joint 
ventures, except where the Group is able to control the 
reversal of the temporary difference and it is probable that the 
temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future. 
Deferred tax is calculated at the tax rates based on those 
enacted or substantially enacted at the statement of financial 
position date. Deferred tax is charged or credited in the 
income statement except when it relates to items charged  
or credited directly to equity, in which case the deferred tax  
is also dealt with in equity.

2 Summary of significant accounting policies 
continued
Taxation continued
Additional taxes arising from the distribution of dividends  
are recognised at the same time as the liability to pay the 
related dividend. 
Leases 
Leases principally comprise operating leases. Payments  
made under operating leases are recognised as an expense  
in the income statement on a straight-line basis over the  
lease term. Any incentives to enter into operating leases  
are recognised as a reduction of rental expense over the  
lease term on a straight-line basis. 
Financial guarantee contracts
Where the Company enters into financial guarantee contracts 
to guarantee the indebtedness of other companies within  
the Group, the Company considers these to be insurance 
arrangements and accounts for them as such. In this respect, 
the guarantee contract is treated as a contingent liability until 
such time as it becomes probable that a payment under the 
guarantee will be required.
Share capital
Ordinary shares are classified as equity. Incremental costs 
directly attributable to the issue of new shares or options are 
shown in equity as a deduction, net of tax, from the proceeds. 
Dividends
Dividends are recognised as distributions in the period in 
which they are declared. Dividends proposed but not declared 
are not recognised but are disclosed in the Note 10 to the 
financial statements.
Share-based payments 
These comprise equity-settled and cash-settled share-based 
compensation plans.
Equity-settled share-based payments are measured at fair 
value at the date of grant and the fair value is expensed over 
the vesting period, based on the estimate of awards that  
will eventually vest. For cash-settled share-based payments,  
a liability equal to the portion of the services received  
is recognised at its current fair value determined at each 
statement of financial position date. Fair value is measured  
by the use of a Black-Scholes option pricing model.
Where options are granted over shares in the Company  
to employees of subsidiaries, the Company recognises  
in its financial statements an increase in the cost of investment  
in its subsidiaries equivalent to the equity-settled share-based 
payment charge recognised in its subsidiaries’ financial 
statements, with the corresponding credit being recognised 
directly in equity.
Retirement benefit obligations 
A defined benefit pension scheme is operated in the United 
Kingdom, which provides benefits based on pensionable 
salary. The details are included in Note 19. The assets  
of the scheme are held separately from those of the Group. 
Pension scheme assets are measured using market values. 
Pension scheme liabilities are measured using a projected  
unit method and discounted at the current rate of return  
on a high-quality corporate bond of equivalent term and 
currency to the liability. The liability recognised in the  
statement of financial position in respect of the defined  
benefit pension scheme is the present value of the defined 
benefit obligations less the fair value of scheme assets  
at the statement of financial position date.
Any increase in the present value of the liabilities of the defined 
benefit pension scheme arising from employee service is 
charged to profit from operations in the period. The expected 
return on the scheme’s assets and the increase during the 
period in the present value of the scheme’s liabilities arising 
from the passage of time are included in finance income  
and finance expense respectively. Actuarial gains and  
losses are recognised in the consolidated statement  
of comprehensive income.
Obligations for contributions to defined contribution pension 
plans are recognised as an expense in the income statement 
as incurred.
Financial assets and liabilities
Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognised  
in the Group’s statement of financial position when the  
Group becomes a party to the contractual provisions  
of the instrument. 
(a) Financial assets
Financial assets are classified as available-for-sale financial 
assets and loans and receivables. The classification depends 
on the nature and purpose of the financial assets and  
is determined at the time of initial recognition.
A financial asset is derecognised only when the contractual 
rights to the cash flows from that asset expire; or it transfers 
the financial asset and substantially all the risks and rewards  
of ownership of the asset to another entity.
Effective interest method 
The effective interest method is a method of calculating the 
amortised cost of a financial asset and of allocating interest 
income over the relevant period. The effective interest rate is 
the rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash receipts 
through the expected life of the financial asset, or, where 
appropriate, a shorter period. Costain Group PLC Annual Report 2011
86 Financial statements
2 Summary of significant accounting policies 
continued
Financial assets and liabilities continued
(a) Financial assets continued
Loans and receivables
Loans and other receivables with fixed or determinable 
payments that are not quoted in an active market are classified 
as loans and receivables and measured at amortised cost 
using the effective interest method, less any impairment. 
Interest income is recognised by applying the effective interest 
rate, except for short-term receivables when the recognition  
of interest would be immaterial. 
Trade and other receivables
Trade and other receivables do not carry interest and  
are stated at their initial value less impairment losses.
 
Impairment of financial assets
Estimated recoverable amounts are based on the ageing  
of the outstanding receivable and individual receivables are 
provided against when management deem the amounts  
are not collectible. 
Cash and cash equivalents 
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash balances and call 
deposits. Bank overdrafts that are repayable on demand and 
form an integral part of the Group’s cash management are 
included as a component of cash and cash equivalents for  
the purpose of the statement of cash flows.
Investments
Investments are recognised and derecognised on the trade 
date where the purchase or sale of an investment is under  
a contract whose terms require delivery of the investment  
within the timeframe established by the market concerned. 
Investments are measured initially at fair value, plus transaction 
costs, except financial assets classified as at fair value through 
profit or loss, which are measured initially at fair value. 
(b) Financial liabilities
Financial liabilities, including borrowings, are initially measured 
at fair value, net of transaction costs. Financial liabilities are 
subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective 
interest method, with interest expense recognised on an 
effective yield basis. Where borrowings are the hedged item  
in an effective fair value hedge relationship, the carrying value 
is adjusted to reflect the fair value movements associated  
with the hedged risk.
Financial liabilities are derecognised only when the obligations 
are discharged, cancelled or expire. 
Trade payables
Trade payables are recognised initially at fair value and 
subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective 
interest method.
(c) Derivative financial instruments
Derivative financial instruments are used in order to manage 
risks arising from changes in foreign exchange rates, interest 
rates and inflation and are measured at their fair value. The fair 
value of forward exchange contracts is their quoted market 
value at the statement of financial position date. The fair value 
of interest rate and RPI swaps is the estimated amount that 
would be received or paid to terminate the swap at the 
statement of financial position date. Valuations for forward 
exchange contracts and interest rate and RPI swaps  
are determined using valuation techniques supported  
by reference to market values for similar transactions. 
Certain derivative financial instruments are designated  
as hedges in line with established risk management policies 
and classified as follows:
•	 Fair value hedges that hedge the exposure to changes  
in the fair value of a recognised asset or liability; and
•	 Cash flow hedges that hedge exposure to variability in cash 
flows that is attributable to either a particular risk associated 
with a recognised asset or liability or a forecast transaction.
For fair value hedges, any gain or loss from re-measuring the 
hedging instrument at fair value is recognised in the income 
statement and adjusted against the carrying amount of the 
hedged item.
For cash flow hedges, the portion of the gain or loss on the 
hedging instrument that is determined to be an effective hedge 
is recognised in equity, with any ineffective portion in the 
income statement. When hedged cash flows result in the 
recognition of a non-financial asset or liability, the associated 
gains or losses previously recognised in equity are included  
in the initial measurement of the asset or liability. For all other 
cash flow hedges, the gains or losses that are recognised  
in equity are transferred to the income statement in the  
same period in which the hedged cash flow affects the  
income statement.
 
Hedge accounting is discontinued when the hedging 
instrument expires or is sold, terminated or exercised,  
or no longer qualifies for hedge accounting. Any cumulative 
gain or loss previously recognised in equity is retained in equity 
until the hedged transaction occurs. If the hedged transaction  
is no longer expected to occur, the net cumulative gain  
or loss is transferred to the income statement. 
  
Any gains or losses arising from changes in fair value  
of derivative financial instruments not designated as hedges 
are recognised in the income statement.

2 Summary of significant accounting policies

Significant areas of judgment and estimation
The estimates and underlying assumptions used in the 
preparation of these financial statements are reviewed  
on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are 
recognised in the period in which the estimate is revised if the 
revision affects only that period, or in the period of the revision 
and future periods if the revision affects both current and 
future periods.
The most critical accounting policies and significant areas of 
judgment and estimation arise from the accounting for defined 
benefit pension schemes under IAS 19 Employee benefits, the 
accounting for long-term contracts under IAS 11 Construction 
contracts, assessments of the carrying value of land and  
from this year, the carrying value of goodwill and acquired 
intangible assets.
Defined benefit pension schemes require significant judgments 
in relation to the assumptions for inflation, future pension 
increases, investment returns and member longevity that 
underpin the valuation. Each year in selecting the appropriate 
assumptions, the directors take advice from an independent 
qualified actuary. The assumptions and resultant sensitivities 
are set out in Note 19.
The majority of the Group’s activities are undertaken via 
long-term contracts and these contracts are accounted for  
in accordance with IAS 11, which requires estimates to be 
made for contract costs and revenues. In many cases, these 
contractual obligations span more than one financial period. 
Also, the costs and revenues may be affected by a number  
of uncertainties that depend on the outcome of future  
events and may require to be revised as events unfold  
and uncertainties are resolved.
Management bases its judgments of costs and revenues  
and its assessment of the expected outcome of each long-
term contractual obligation on the latest available information,  
this includes detailed contract valuations and forecasts of the 
costs to complete. The estimates of the contract position and 
the profit or loss earned to date are updated regularly and 
significant changes are highlighted through established  
internal review procedures. The impact of any change  
in the accounting estimates is then reflected in the  
financial statements.
Alcaidesa Holding SA, one of the Group’s joint ventures, 
operates in the Spanish real estate market and holds land  
and property within its current and non-current assets.  
At 31 December 2011, a review of the net realisable value  
of each of its land holdings was undertaken, including the  
use of external valuations, and provisions, if considered 
necessary, have been reflected in these financial statements. 
Reviewing the carrying value of goodwill and intangible assets 
recognised on acquisition requires judgments, principally,  
in respect of growth rates and future cash flows of cash 
generating units, the useful lives of intangible assets and the 
selection of discount rates used to calculate present values.
IFRSs not applied
The following Adopted IFRS has been endorsed but is not 
mandatory and has not been applied by the Group in these 
financial statements. Adoption is not expected to have  
a material affect on the financial statements.
•	 IFRS 7 ‘Amendments to Financial instruments:  
Disclosures – transfers of financial assets (mandatory  
for years commencing on or after 1 July 2011).
The following IFRSs have not been endorsed but may be 
applicable in the future:
•	 IFRS 9 ‘Financial instruments’ – classification of financial 
assets for measurement purposes. This is not expected  
to have a significant impact on the financial statements.
•	 IAS 19 ‘Employee benefits’ – this amendment will require the 
financing cost of a defined benefit scheme to be calculated 
on the net surplus or deficit. It will increase the net pension 
interest expense. It should be effective for 2013.
•	 IFRS 11 ‘Joint arrangements’ – this may result in changes  
to the classification of certain jointly controlled operations 
where the Group accounts for its share of the individual 
assets and liabilities, to being equity accounted as 
associates or joint ventures. It will not affect the Group’s 
profit for the period or net assets. It should be effective  
for 2013. Costain Group PLC Annual Report 2011

3 Operating segments
Segment information is based on four business segments: Environment, Infrastructure, Energy & Process and Land 
Development operations in Spain. The segments are strategic business units with separate management reporting  
to a segment managing director and have different core customers or different services. This information is provided  
to the Chief Executive who is the chief operating decision maker. The segments are discussed in the Business review  
section of these financial statements.
The accounting policies of the operating segments are the same as those described in the summary of significant accounting 
policies. The Group evaluates segment performance on the basis of profit or loss from operations before interest and income  
tax expense. The segment results that are reported to the Chief Executive include items directly attributable to a segment  
as well as those that can be allocated on a reasonable basis. 
Intersegment sales and transfers are not material.

Factors that may affect future tax charges

There are no expiry dates associated with the deferred tax assets, recognised and not recognised, and tax relief will be obtained 
if suitable profits arise in the future.
A further reduction to reflect the proposed tax rate of 23.0% from 1 April 2014 would reduce the deferred tax asset by £1.4 million.

Goodwill has been allocated to the applicable cash generating units identified within the Infrastructure and Energy & Process 
reporting segments. 
As described in Note 2, the Group reviews the value of goodwill and in the absence of any identified impairment risks, tests are 
based on internal value in use calculations of the cash generating unit (CGU). The key assumptions for these calculations are: 
discount rates, growth rates and expected changes to revenue and direct costs during the period.
Discount rates have been estimated based on pre-tax rates that reflect current market assessments of the Group’s weighted 
average cost of capital and the risks specific to the CGU. The rate used to discount the forecast cash flows for the CGU in 
Infrastructure was 14% and for the CGU in Energy & Process was 16%.
The Group prepares cash flow forecasts derived from the most recent financial forecasts for the following two years and 
extrapolates those cash flows based on the following internal assessments of the annual growth rates attributable to the 
acquired businesses:
Growth rates
Infrastructure

Energy 
& Process

Year 3 5 40
Years 4-5 2.5 2.5
Long-term average 1.5 1.5
As at 31 December 2011, based on these internal valuations, the recoverable value of goodwill exceeded the carrying amounts.  97

in progress.  
The directors consider that the carrying amount of trade, other receivables and amounts owed by joint ventures and associates 
approximates to their fair value. Based on prior experience, the directors believe that the trade receivables are recoverable and, 
other than as disclosed in Note 25, there is no allowance for bad or doubtful debts (2010: £Nil). 101

14 Trade and other receivables continued
The average credit period within trade receivables on amounts billed for construction work and on sales of goods is 31 days 
(2010: 30 days). The analysis of the due dates of the trade receivables was £61.5 million (2010: £39.3 million) due within  
30 days, £19.6 million (2010: £14.1 million) due between 30 and 60 days and £3.7 million (2010: £1.5 million) due after 60 days.
Included in the trade receivables balance are debtors, with a carrying amount of £6.1 million (2010: £2.2 million), which are  
past due at the reporting date for which no provision has been made as there has been no significant change in credit quality 
and the amounts are considered recoverable. No collateral is held over these balances.
The aggregate amount of costs incurred plus recognised profits, less recognised losses, for all contracts in progress at the 
statement of financial position date was £2,789.6 million (2010: £3,132.5 million). Progress billings and advances received from 
customers under open construction contracts amounted to £2,757.9 million (2010: £3,070.5 million). Advances for which work 
has not started, and billings in excess of costs incurred and recognised profits are included in credit balances on long-term 
contracts (Note 17).

16 Financial instruments and risk management
The Group’s centralised treasury function manages financial risk, principally arising from movements in foreign currency rates, 
interest rates and inflation rates and liquidity and funding risks, in accordance with policies agreed by the directors. To manage 
these risks, forward foreign currency sale and purchase contracts are used in respect of foreign currency requirements and 
interest rate and RPI swaps are used for PFI investments.
The Group does not enter into speculative transactions.
The Company does not have any forward foreign currency contracts or other derivatives.
Capital Management
The Group’s objectives when managing capital are to safeguard its ability to continue as a going concern and to provide resources  
to grow the business, in order to provide returns for shareholders and other stakeholders. The Group has no long-term debt and the 
current capital base of the Group is driven by equity capital from shareholders and retained earnings. The Board of directors (‘Board’) 
continues to explore options to strengthen the Group by growing the business and improving profitability; the Business review 
describes the Group’s strategy and its operations. It is the Board’s policy to progressively increase dividends paid to shareholders 
based on growth in underlying earnings per share after taking account of the investment and capital needs of the business.
The Group increased its banking and bonding facilities during the year and these now include a £45 million Revolving Credit 
Facility. It also extended the term of the facilities to 30 September 2015 and revised the covenant structure. The new facilities 
have financial covenants based on profit, interest cover and leverage measured quarterly. There were no other changes in the 
Board’s approach to capital management during the year.
Liquidity and funding risk
Ultimate responsibility for liquidity and funding risk rests with the Board, which has put in place a monitoring and reporting 
framework to manage funding requirements. 
Liquidity risk is managed by monitoring actual and forecast short and medium term cash flows and the maturity profile of 
financial assets and liabilities and by maintaining adequate cash reserves. The nature and timing of the contract cash flows 
causes the cash balances to vary over the month with the balance usually highest at the month-end.
The average month-end cash balance during the year was £130.4 million (2010: £116.0 million).
Customers awarding long-term contracting work may, as a condition of the award, require the contractor to provide performance 
and other bonds. Consequently, the Group is reliant on its ability to secure bank and surety bonds. Therefore, it has facilities  
in place to provide these bonds and it monitors the usage and regularly updates the forecast usage of these facilities. Costain Group PLC Annual Report 2011

Credit risk
The Group uses an external credit scoring system to assess a potential customer’s credit quality and will enter into a contract 
only if that assessment is satisfactory. Deposits in the United Kingdom are placed with the bank facility providers or, in jointly 
controlled operations, with banks agreed by the partners. Overseas deposits are placed with major banks operating in those 
countries. Transactions involving derivative financial instruments are with bank or insurance company counter-parties with high 
credit ratings, that are monitored regularly and with whom there are signed netting agreements. Given the high credit ratings  
of the banks and insurance companies used, management do not expect any counter-party will fail to meet its obligations. 
At the year-end date, there were no significant concentrations of credit risk. The maximum exposure to credit risk is represented 
by the carrying amounts of each financial asset, including derivative financial instruments, and the individual constituents  
of amounts due from customers for contract work in the statement of financial position. Further information on the exposure  
to credit risk is set out in Note 14.
Interest rate risk 
The Group has cash balances in the United Kingdom and Overseas and bank borrowings Overseas. The largest constituents  
are United Kingdom balances denominated in Pounds sterling. A 1% rise in interest rates would have increased the annual net 
interest income on cash balances by £1.3 million (2010: £1.2 million).
The only interest rate hedging currently undertaken by the Group is within PFI investments, where interest rate derivatives have 
been used as a means of hedging interest rate risk. The policy is to fix the interest cost on variable rate financing on specific 
projects by taking out floating to fixed interest rate swaps; these swaps are designated to the underlying debt obligations and  
are expected to be effective for cash flow hedge accounting purposes.
Foreign currency risk
Transactional currency exposures arise from sales or purchases by operating companies in currencies other than their functional 
currency. The current strategy is to hedge both committed and forecast foreign currency exposures, where applicable, and 
where the transaction timing and amount can be determined reliably and no natural hedge exists. Forward contracts are only 
entered into when a contractual commitment exists in respect of the foreign currency transaction and it is the policy to negotiate 
the terms of the hedge derivatives to match the terms of the hedged item to maximise hedge effectiveness.
At 31 December 2011, the net monetary assets denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the operation 
involved were US Dollar denominated net assets of £0.1 million (2010: £0.2 million) and Euro denominated net monetary assets 
of £16.5 million (2010: £10.9 million) in members of the Group with sterling as their functional currency. 
A 10% strengthening in the US Dollar would have impacted the results favourably by £0.1 million (2010: £Nil). A 10% 
strengthening in the Euro would have adversely impacted the results by £0.2 million (2010: adversely impacted by £0.2 million).  
A 10% strengthening in the UAE Dirham would have adversely impacted the results by £0.2 million (2010: £0.3 million). 103

Cash flow hedges
The Group uses foreign currency contracts and interest rate swaps. Foreign currency contracts are measured using quoted 
forward exchange rates and yield curves derived from quoted interest rates matching maturities of the contracts. Interest rate 
swaps are measured at the present value of the future cash flows estimated and discounted based on the applicable yield 
curves derived from quoted interest rates.
At 31 December 2011, the Group had foreign currency contracts (26 purchase contracts (2010: 67) and 11 sale contracts  
(2010: 33)) designated as hedges of committed future purchases. The Group held no other foreign currency sale  
contracts (2010: Nil).
Forward currency contracts, which hedge forecast transactions are classified as cash flow hedges and stated at fair value  
based on a Level 2 valuation method. These amounts were recognised as fair value derivatives. The terms of the foreign  
currency contracts match the terms of the commitments. There were no ineffective hedges at the year-end (2010: Nil).
Foreign currency sale and purchase contracts outstanding at 31 December 2011 are summarised below. The carrying  
value represents the fair value of the contract; the contractual cash flows represent the sterling commitments.

At 31 December 2011, PFI project companies in which the Group has an interest and records as investments in associates,  
had entered into the following swaps to hedge the interest rate risk of bank loans. These swaps are classified as cash flow

The switch from RPI to CPI relates only to Guaranteed Minimum Pensions (GMPs) accrued between 6 April 1988 and  
5 April 1997. Under the rules of the scheme, these GMP amounts are increased in the course of payment in line with statutory 
requirements (which now provide for increases in line with CPI rather than RPI). Benefits in excess of the GMP continue to be 
increased in line with RPI in accordance with the provisions of the rules. The impact on the liability of allowing for 3% CPI rather 
than 3% RPI on the post 1988 GMP is around £4.5 million.

The Group expects to contribute an amount equal to dividends paid to shareholders and the expenses of administration  
to its defined benefit scheme in the next financial year.
Defined contribution schemes
Several defined contribution pensions are operated. The total expense relating to these plans was £5.3 million (2010: £5.3 million). 
(b) Share-based payments
The company operates a number of share based payment plans as described below.
Long-Term Incentive Plans (‘LTIP’)
The Long-term Incentive Plan was approved by shareholders at the 2002 AGM. The LTIP allows for conditional awards with  
a maximum face value of up to 100% of base salary with a performance condition based on EPS. 
Deferred Share Bonus Plan (‘DSBP’) 
Executive Directors and other senior management are eligible to participate in the Company’s Deferred Share Bonus Plan which 
promotes greater alignment with shareholders through an award of deferred shares. The DSBP allows for conditional awards 
with a face value of up to 50% of base salary with a performance condition based on EBIT (Earnings before interest and tax). 
The deferred bonus award will vest on the second anniversary of the date of grant. The shares to satisfy the deferred bonus will 
be purchased by a trust on behalf of the Group and so the DSBP will not lead to any dilution of shareholder interest. Participants 
must be in employment with the Company and not under notice of termination (either given or received) on the date of vesting. 
Save As You Earn Plans (‘SAYE’)
The company operates a number of SAYE plans which are open to all employees. Employees pay a fixed amount from salary 
into a savings account each month and may elect to save over three or five years. At the end of the savings period, employees 
have six months in which to exercise their options using the funds saved. If employees decide not to exercise their options,  
they may withdraw the funds saved; the options expire six months after maturity. Exercise of options is subject to continued 
employment within the Group (except where permitted by the rules of the scheme). 111

Share options outstanding at the end of the year had a weighted average remaining contractual life of 3.6 years (2010: 3 years). 
Fair value of options granted during the year 
The fair value of options granted are calculated using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. The aggregate fair value of options 
granted during the year was £3.2 million (2010: £2.7 million). The assumptions used in valuing the grants were:
2011 2010
Expected volatility 20% 20%
Expected life (years) 2.7– 5.0 2.7
Risk-free interest rate 3.6% 4.2%
Expected dividend yield 2% 2%
The expected volatility is based on the historical share price volatility over a term matching the expected life. The expected  
life is based on managements best estimate having regard to the effect of non-transferability, exercise restrictions and 
behavioural considerations. Costain Group PLC Annual Report 2011

24 Acquisitions
On 6 April 2011, the Group purchased 75% of the share capital of ClerkMaxwell Limited (‘ClerkMaxwell’) and entered  
in to a call option to acquire the remaining 25% between 26 April and 31 May 2011, which the Group exercised. The business,  
which is based in the UK, provides front-end engineering and support services to the upstream oil and gas sector.
The initial consideration, including the cost of exercising the call option was £3.2 million. Further payments, based on an 8 times 
multiple of EBITDA, may also be payable after the completion of the results for the years to December 2012, 2013 and 2014.  
The specified percentage to be used in this calculation increases each year.
The total estimated value of these future payments is £6.1 million. Part of the payment estimated at £1.3 million is based  
only on the financial performance in years 2011, 2012 and 2013. This has been included in the cost of acquisition (below)  
and as a financial liability based on a Level 3 valuation method. The balance of the payments, estimated at £4.8 million,  
are dependent on continued future service and, in accordance with IFRS 3, will be expensed to the income statement  
(2011 expense £0.4 million). The payments are dependent on the future performance and financial results and the  
£1.3 million provided as part of the cost of acquisition could range between £0.5 million and £2.1 million.
On 20 August 2011, the Group purchased the entire share capital of Promanex Group Holdings Limited (‘Promanex’) for a 
consideration of £14.6 million, including the repayment of loans provided by the principal shareholder. A management retention 
payment of £1.6 million was agreed, this is normally payable on the second anniversary following completion and is being 
charged to the income statement. Promanex provides a range of services across the UK and Ireland in management, operation, 
maintenance and repair of customers’ sites and plant assets; water services; civils and industrial services and mechanical and 
electrical services. 
The Group believes the acquisitions will broaden the Group’s capabilities in ongoing care and maintenance and strengthens  
the Group’s presence in key growth target markets, particularly power, nuclear process, hydrocarbons and chemicals and  
water, where significant investment is needed to meet national needs.
The contributions to revenue and operating profit before amortisation of acquired intangibles and employment related 
consideration within the Group’s results of these acquisitions were ClerkMaxwell: revenue £5.2 million, operating profit  
£0.4 million and Promanex revenue £23.5 million, operating profit £0.9 million.
The proforma figures as required by IFRS 3, assuming that the acquisitions had been part of the Group throughout the  
year, were revenue £65.7 million and operating profit before amortisation of acquired intangibles and employment related 
consideration £2.0 million.

The Annual Report is printed by an FSC (Forest Stewardship Council),  
ISO 14001 and Carbon Neutral certified printer using vegetable  
based inks. (ISO 14001 is a pattern of control for an environmental 
management system against which an organisation can be credited  
by a third party. FSC ensures there is an audited chain of custody from  
the tree in the well-managed forest through to the finished document  
in the printing factory.)
This Report has been printed on Revive 100 Pure White Gloss and Revive 
100 White Offset – both are recycled papers. They contain 100% recycled 
waste, are FSC certified and produced at a mill with ISO 14001 certification. 
Recycled fibres used are Process Chlorine Free.
 
If you have finished reading the Annual Report and no longer wish  
to retain it, please pass it on to other interested readers or return it  
to Costain Group PLC or dispose of it in your recycled paper waste.  
Thank you.

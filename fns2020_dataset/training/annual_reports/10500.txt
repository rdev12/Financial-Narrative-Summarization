Strong start to the current ﬁnancial year
1. The ﬁnancial highlights relate to the Pro Forma Income Statement covering the years ended 31 December 
2006 and 31 December 2007 assuming a debt free acquisition of Moneysupermarket.com Financial Group 
Limited by the Company on 1 January 2006, from which date intangible amortisation commenced, and a share 
option charge which reﬂects the average charge over the vesting period of currently unexercised options. 
 The Directors anticipate presenting ﬁnancial information on a similar basis until the ﬁnal results for the year 
ended 31 December 2008. Thereafter the need to present a Pro Forma Income Statement will not be 
required because the relevant comparator period will be consistent with the current period. Further 
information on the Pro Forma Income Statement is set out in the Business Review on page 10.
2. Adjusted EBITDA is calculated by the Directors by making certain adjustments to the historical compensation 
levels of the Directors and senior managers, and share based bonus awards to employees on the listing of the 
Company. These adjustments reﬂect the Directors’ and senior managers’ proﬁt share, discretionary bonus and 
related employer’s national insurance contribution. They also include charges relating to the issue of free 
shares to each eligible employee to the value of £3,000, charges relating to the conditional share award made 
to Gerald Corbett on listing and charges related to share based compensation relating to options issued prior 
to listing. Following listing, these elements of compensation no longer apply at these levels. For further 
information, see page 10. 02 www.moneysupermarket.com Annual Report 2007

How We Do It
Our price comparison services offer a compelling value proposition
to both consumers and product providers, by simplifying consumers’ 
research, improving the consumer’s shopping experience and 
enabling product providers and advertisers to effectively target their
marketing spend.
Our business strategy
The Group has a highly focused business strategy to ensure  
it maintains its position as the UK’s leading price comparison 
website and to support its continued growth.
Growing the Moneysupermarket.com brand
We invest signiﬁcantly in marketing, including television 
advertising, to promote awareness in our brand and to ensure
it is synonymous amongst consumers with price comparison
in the UK.
Improving the consumer experience
Improving the consumer experience sits at the heart of our 
business strategy. We continually improve website functionality, 
introduce new features such as MyMoneysupermarket, new 
products, additional editorial content, consumer and expert 
reviews, forums and community features. This enables consumers 
to consider a wide range of factors before making their 
purchasing decision and increases their conﬁdence, trust and 
loyalty in the Moneysupermarket.com brand and the beneﬁts of 
the services we offer.
Innovating and maintaining our position as the UK’s leading 
price comparison website
We focus our resources on innovation across all aspects of  
our business. Consumers see the beneﬁt of this innovation  
in enhanced website functionality, improvements in existing 
products or the addition of new products or features. We 
continually enhance the consumer experience so that we  
remain their preferred choice for price comparison in the UK.
Leveraging our existing consumer base, technology and 
marketing expertise 
We utilise our signiﬁcant sales, marketing and industry expertise 
to drive the growth of the Group in the price comparison 
marketplace. We identify opportunities to offer new services  
and products to our consumer base and to use our technology  
in innovative new ways. 
How we generate revenue
We generate revenue by introducing consumers to product 
providers whose products feature in the price comparison results 
on our website, in return for a fee from that provider on either a 
cost per click (‘CPC’) or cost per action (‘CPA’) basis.
Revenue is earned under CPC pricing arrangements when a 
consumer clicks through from our website to a provider’s 
website, having chosen the provider’s product from our price 
comparison results page.
Revenue is earned under CPA pricing arrangements when a 
consumer clicks through from our website to a provider’s 
website, having chosen the provider’s product and either 
completes an application for a product or purchases a product 
from that provider.
We also generate revenue from the display of advertisements on 
our website on a cost per thousand impressions (‘CPM’) basis. 
We generate an ‘impression’ of an advertisement each time it 
appears on one of our web pages viewed by a consumer.
Our Business 05 Annual Report 2007 www.moneysupermarket.com
How we attract and retain consumers
Our brand is one of our most important and valuable assets.  
We have invested heavily as part of a highly focused marketing 
strategy to develop the Moneysupermarket.com brand and  
to market it to existing and new consumers. This ensures we 
continue to attract increasing numbers of visitors to our website 
and continue to maintain our position as the UK’s leading price 
comparison website. In 2007, our website attracted 91.0m 
visitors, representing an increase of 31.9m visitors on 2006.
Our marketing strategy incorporates the following elements:
Ofﬂine marketing
Television
Between 1 January and 31 December 2007, we spent £17m on 
television advertising including programme sponsorship. The 
television campaigns have generated a signiﬁcant increase in 
direct-to-site trafﬁc and brand awareness. Television advertising 
has helped improve our online brand recognition from 40% of 
internet subscribing UK adults in July 2006 to 73% in November 
2007 according to a survey commissioned from YouGov.
Radio
We utilise radio advertising to promote speciﬁc channels and the 
Moneysupermarket.com brand generally. We currently focus on 
balancing advertising to promote overall brand awareness and 
targeted advertising to increase consumer trafﬁc to speciﬁc high 
value channels, such as motor insurance in March, when 
consumers tend to renew their motor insurance.
Press
We pursue a focused strategy to ensure we feature heavily in  
the national press through news articles, expert commentary  
on topical issues and the provision of comparison ‘best buy’ 
tables to a number of national newspapers including  
the Telegraph, Independent and Times. These often  
feature the Moneysupermarket.com brand which builds 
consumer association with the Group as the UK’s leading  
price comparison website.
Online marketing
Search engine optimisation (‘SEO’)
We utilise SEO activities to maximise direct-to-site trafﬁc from 
search engines such as Google to our website. SEO activities 
focus on enhancing the rankings of our website in the natural 
results of search engines when a consumer makes an internet 
search. Search engines do not charge for trafﬁc generated in  
this way.
Search engine marketing (‘SEM’)
SEM focuses on the purchase of sponsored listings on search 
engines generated when a consumer makes an internet search. 
Sponsored listings typically appear at the top or right hand side 
of a search engine results page. We aim to feature our website  
at or near the top of the sponsored listings table for relevant 
keyword searches undertaken by a consumer.
Portal partners
We have relationships with over 200 portal partners including 
many of the leading websites in the UK, such as the Financial 
Times, Telegraph, Sky and Virgin Media. We integrate our 
ﬁnancial comparison content and best buy tables within the 
portal partner and these contain hyperlinks which drive 
consumer trafﬁc to our website. 
Our Business 06 www.moneysupermarket.com Annual Report 2007
Chairman’s Statement
‘I am pleased to report a strong set of results for the period ending 
31 December 2007 . Revenues for the year grew by 55.9% to £162.9m 
with signiﬁcant growth across all areas of the internet business.
This year has begun positively and we are conﬁdent that our business 
is sufﬁciently robust and diversiﬁed for the Group to continue to 
prosper during the so called credit crunch.’ 
It has been a year of great change and 
growth for the Group, culminating with the 
ﬂotation of the Company on the London 
Stock Exchange on 31 July 2007 and strong 
revenue and proﬁt growth throughout  
the year. The shareholding structure was 
revised earlier in the year with Simon Nixon 
acquiring the bulk of Duncan Cameron’s 
stake. This facilitated the subsequent 
ﬂotation which leaves Simon with 54.5%  
of the Company. 
I became Chairman in June ahead of the 
ﬂotation. Michael Wemms, who is our 
Senior Independent Non-Executive 
Director and chairs the Remuneration 
Committee, also joined me prior to the 
ﬂotation. Rob Rowley joined the Board in 
September to chair our Audit Committee. 
Both are hugely experienced businessmen 
with many years of public company service. 
Our challenge is to support Simon and his 
team as the Group grows and makes the 
transition from private to public. Greater 
size and complexity inevitably requires 
more process and structure but at the 
same time the entrepreneurial spirit at the 
heart of the Group’s success must not be 
stiﬂed and must ﬂourish. The new Board 
has made a good start, addressing the 
issues in an open and constructive way.
I am pleased to report a strong set of 
results for the period ending 31 December 
2007. Revenues for the year grew by 55.9% 
to £162.9m with signiﬁcant growth across 
all areas of the internet business. This was 
underpinned by growth in the number of 
visitors and an increase in the revenues 
generated by each visitor across each of 
the internet verticals that the Group 
operates within. 
Visitor growth has been in part driven by a 
rigorous television advertising campaign. 
This has signiﬁcantly improved brand 
recognition and encouraged consumers  
to visit our website directly, thereby 
improving gross margins. Revenue per 
visitor has increased from a continual 
improvement in the product sets we offer 
and generally from consumers’ increased 
conﬁdence in transacting online as a result 
of increased broadband penetration. 
Adjusted EBITDA increased by 57.2% to 
£52.9m which was slightly in excess of 
revenue growth. The adjusted cost base 
increased from £31.3m to £57.3m with the 
main increases from television advertising 
which rose £12.2m over last year and 
adjusted employee costs which grew  
by £6.6m to £22.8m as we continued to 
develop our product ranges.
Over the next year the Board will be 
focused upon improving the process and 
structure within the Group, working closely 
with the Executive Management Team. 
This will ensure we have the right balance 
between entrepreneurial culture and 
operational efﬁciency. 
This year has begun positively and we are 
conﬁdent that our business is sufﬁciently 
robust and diversiﬁed for the Group to 
continue to prosper during the so called 
credit crunch. This conﬁdence underpins 
the Board’s decision to recommend a ﬁnal 
dividend of 1.63p per ordinary share, to be 
paid on 30 April 2008 to ordinary 
shareholders on the register of members 
on 25 March 2008. The Group did not pay 
an interim dividend in 2007.
The new Board has settled in well and I 
would like to thank my colleagues for their 
contributions. More importantly, on behalf 
of the Board, I would like to thank our 
Executive Management Team and all of 
the Group’s employees for their hard work 
and commitment. This strong result is to 
their credit and gives us all conﬁdence for 
the future.

Chief Executive’s Report
‘I am pleased to present my ﬁrst Chief Executive’s Report for
what has been a very successful year for the Group. We have 
continued to grow the business substantially whilst investing 
signiﬁcantly for the future.’
I am pleased to present my ﬁrst Chief 
Executive’s Report for what has been a 
very successful year for the Group. We 
have continued to grow the business 
substantially whilst investing signiﬁcantly 
for the future. This has all taken place  
in a year when we ﬂoated the Group on  
the London Stock Exchange in the very 
challenging and volatile markets of July 
2007. The Group entered the FTSE 250 in 
September 2007. 
Group revenues grew by 55.9% in 2007 to 
£162.9m. Internet revenues increased by 
63.7% to £152.2m and adjusted EBITDA by 
57.2% to £52.9m. All areas of the internet 
business performed well whilst the 
intermediary business was broadly stable 
in 2007. 
Despite the well documented turbulence 
in credit markets in 2007, the Money 
vertical traded successfully throughout  
the year. Revenues grew by 48.7% and we 
believe this demonstrates the value that 
our business delivers to both consumers 
and providers. We believe providers 
reduced advertising spend on other  
media whilst maintaining their commercial 
relationships with the Group because it 
offers targeted and focused advertising 
spend and generates a greater return  
on investment than many other forms  
of media.
In the Insurance vertical, revenues grew by 
74.7% to £54.4m in 2007. We maintained a 
strong market position in a sector which 
continues to show rapid growth through 
greater consumer awareness and 
increasing use of online aggregators.  
We have the most complete insurance 
comparison engine in the UK offering the 
consumer the widest choice of providers. 
We have a very strong brand with 73%  
of online consumers recognising the 
Moneysupermarket.com brand. This gives 
the Group a strong competitive advantage 
and a powerful base from which to defend 
and grow its position as the UK’s leading 
price comparison website.
 
The Travel vertical increased its  
revenues by 100.9% to £15.0m.  
The Travelsupermarket.com brand is 
recognised in its own right and is the  
clear market leader in its ﬁeld. We have 
made the product more comprehensive, 
adding additional channels which enable 
the business to cater for more of our 
consumers’ requirements. Inventory  
has been increased allowing the  
consumer to compare more providers. This 
improves the consumer experience and 
engenders trust in the Group. Ultimately 
we believe these factors will make 
Travelsupermarket.com the preferred and 
most trusted travel website in the UK.
Home Services revenues have increased by 
280.2% to £4.5m. The focus this year has 
been on growing market share in a vertical 
where there were already established 
competitor businesses. We have been 
successful in the application of this 
strategy. We have leveraged our already 
substantial user base, the strength of  
our brand and our sales and marketing 
expertise to take market share from the 
incumbents. Home Services continues to 
show rapid growth, albeit from a small 
base, but also beneﬁts the business by 
widening the Group’s offering to the 
consumer. This gives the consumer even 
more reasons to return to our website.
We launched our business in Germany 
(www.icero.de) in October 2007, initially 
offering home and motor insurance 
partnering with a third party who provided 
the technology. We had some success in 
2007 but are working hard now to improve 
and focus our offering to the consumer in 
2008. We will not commit signiﬁcant 
investment to promoting the service until 
we are satisﬁed with progress in this area.
I believe the Group has achieved a  
great deal in 2007 and its success is  
largely down to the dedication of our 
employees. I would like to thank them  
for their continuing efforts. 08 www.moneysupermarket.com Annual Report 2007 Our Business
different ‘retailers’ at the click of a mouse. 
It is not good enough to be the best and 
most trusted in 70% of the things you  
do because ultimately the remaining  
30% of the business will suffer. Product  
is therefore key to our success. This is 
encapsulated through two of our key 
operating values:
To build services that we would feel 
proud to recommend to close family 
and friends.
To endeavour to offer our consumers 
the widest selection of products 
enabling them to compare and buy 
online in all of the major sectors  
of the market. Content is therefore 
paramount.
These values sit at the heart of all of the 
products and services we develop.
Product development introduces more 
relevant consumers to more relevant 
product providers and improves both 
consumer satisfaction and provider 
conversion. By constantly improving our 
service to both of these key stakeholders, 
the Group will continue to prosper and 
maintain its position as the UK’s leading 
price comparison website.
In 2007 we introduced a number of key 
developments in this area. For example:
We extended the question set within  
our motor insurance channel to enable 
consumers to obtain a more tailored 
quote for their particular circumstances. 
The response has been good and we 
have seen an increase in conversion  
rates recorded by providers. This has 
generated increased revenues per visitor 
in the motor insurance channel since the 
new question set was introduced. 
•

•
Strategic context 
As the UK’s leading price comparison 
website, the Group is very well placed to 
respond to a continuing structural shift in 
consumers’ and advertisers’ behaviour. 
Increasing broadband penetration in the 
UK has dramatically improved the online 
experience. It is ‘always on’ and gives 
much faster access than a dial-up 
connection. As a result, consumers are 
spending ever increasing amounts of time 
online. The consumption of internet media 
now accounts for more than one quarter of 
all media consumption in the UK. As 
consumers’ online time increases so their 
conﬁdence and familiarity with transacting 
over the internet improves. Advertisers  
are increasingly recognising this in their 
consumer acquisition strategies and are 
allocating ever increasing amounts of their 
advertising budgets from traditional ofﬂine 
media to the internet. We believe the 
Group provides the largest and most 
effective price comparison marketplace  
in the UK, matching relevant and ready- 
to-transact consumers with providers. 
Our strategy, which aims to capitalise  
on this structural shift, is built upon two 
primary objectives:
To continue to innovate with a constant 
focus on improving our existing 
products and improving the consumer/
provider experience.
To improve the volumes and mix of 
trafﬁc to the Group’s website by 
increasing brand awareness of 
Moneysupermarket.com.
Innovation and product development
It is imperative we maintain our leading 
edge in product development. The 
internet is unique in that it offers 
consumers the ability to move between

Chief Executive’s Report continued
‘As the UK’s leading price comparison website, the Group is very well 
placed to respond to a continuing structural shift in consumers’ and 
advertisers’ behaviour.’ 09 Annual Report 2007 www.moneysupermarket.com Our Business
In July 2007 we introduced 
MyMoneysupermarket. This enables 
consumers to enter their details once 
within our safe and secure systems; 
these details can then be used to 
prepopulate application forms which 
can save the consumer time and effort 
at the time of renewal. It also, through 
the log in feature, enables us to get a 
better understanding of our consumers 
and tailor our products and services to 
their individual needs.
We have added more user and 
professional reviews and signiﬁcantly 
grown our forums feature. We now have 
more than 24,000 registered users and 
many times more viewers of our forums 
who interact with each other to discuss 
topics of interest and concern to them 
which increases consumers’ afﬁnity with 
the website.
We believe that these developments in 
particular contributed signiﬁcantly to 
increasing the revenue per visitor across 
our business during 2007.
Brand awareness
Marketing and PR drive new consumers to 
our website. We began ofﬂine initiatives a 
number of years ago with the supply of 
best buy tables to the personal ﬁnance 
sections of national newspapers. This 
continues and today we supply the best 
buy tables for seven newspapers including 
the Telegraph, Times and Independent. 
More recently, in 2006, we extended our 
ofﬂine initiatives into television and radio 
advertising which have stepped up 
considerably in 2007. The success of  
this is reﬂected in two key areas:
Our online brand recognition increased 
from 40% in July 2006 to 73% in 
November 2007 according to a YouGov 
survey commissioned for the Group.
•
•
•
Our gross margins increased from  
61.1% to 66.7% as the Group earned  
a greater proportion of its revenues 
from consumers who came directly  
to the website rather than from  
search engine marketing or portal 
partners where there is a direct  
cost of consumer acquisition. 
We need to retain our position in the  
front of consumers’ minds as a trusted 
consumer champion and to become their 
de facto choice when considering  
their ﬁnancial, insurance, travel and  
home services requirements.
Current trading and outlook
We have made a strong start to the current 
ﬁnancial year. The Money vertical has 
enjoyed double digit growth year to date, 
with broadly ﬂat performance in loans and 
mortgages in a declining market offset by 
very strong growth in credit card and 
savings products. The other verticals, 
Insurance, Travel and Home Services, have 
maintained the momentum experienced in 
the second half of 2007. In line with our 
business plan, we anticipate a step up in 
costs in the ﬁrst half of 2008 associated 
with our continued investment in the 
business and development of our German 
subsidiary. We remain very conﬁdent in our 
diverse business model and the beneﬁt it 
brings to consumers and providers. 
Given current trading and the ongoing 
investment programme, we are conﬁdent 
that we can have another successful year.

Moneysupermarket.com Group PLC (the ‘Company’) was formed as a new holding 
company on 14 March 2007 and it acquired Moneysupermarket.com Financial Group 
Limited and its subsidiaries (together the ‘Group’) on 22 June 2007. Accordingly  
the Group is presenting consolidated results for the period from 22 June 2007  
to 31 December 2007. These have been presented on pages 41 to 59. Revenues  
in the period were £88.3m (2006: £nil), generating a net proﬁt before tax of £7.6m  
(2006: £nil). Including a tax credit for the period of £1.8m, total proﬁt for the  
period was £9.4m.
The Group is also presenting below a Pro Forma Income Statement for the years ended 
31 December 2006 and 31 December 2007 to show what the ﬁnancial results would 
have been had the Company acquired Moneysupermarket.com Financial Group Limited 
on 1 January 2006. The Directors believe that this will allow users of the ﬁnancial 
information to gain a better understanding of the underlying performance of the 
business. This is consistent with the presentation in both the interim statements for 
2007 and in the prospectus issued in connection with the listing of the Group in July 
2007. The Pro Forma Income Statement forms the basis of the commentary contained  
in the Business Review presented below unless otherwise stated.

Notes
Basis of preparation
The pro forma results show the trading results of the Group for the years ended
31 December 2006 and 31 December 2007 adjusted for the following assumptions:
The acquisition of Moneysupermarket.com Financial Group Limited by the Company 
occurred debt free on 1 January 2006.
The charge included within the pro forma results for share options is the average 
expected charge over the vesting period of options still to be exercised following 
the listing of the Company on 31 July 2007.
Pro Forma basic and diluted earnings per ordinary share ﬁgures have been included 
which are based on an adjusted net proﬁt ﬁgure assuming that the number of ordinary 
shares and options in issue at 31 December 2007 had been in issue since 1 January 
2006. The diluted earnings per ordinary share calculation for the year ended 31 
December 2007 does however include a weighting for Long Term Incentive Plan awards 
made on 28 December 2007. The pro forma earnings per share calculations assume a 
30% tax rate for 2006 and 2007.
The Directors regard an adjusted EBITDA ﬁgure as being the most meaningful proﬁt 
measure for this period. The following adjustments have been made to the Pro Forma 
Income Statement:
The acquisition of Moneysupermarket.com Financial Group Limited by the Company 
gave rise to £207.2m of intangible assets. These are to be written off over a period  
of 3-10 years with a charge of £25.2m per annum to be recorded in each of the ﬁrst 
three years. This has been shown within administrative expenses as a charge of 
£25.2m in the 2006 and 2007 Pro Forma Income Statements. 
With effect from the Listing of the Company on 31 July 2007, Directors’ and senior 
management’s compensation was revised and the individuals entered into new 
service agreements. Directors’ and certain senior management’s proﬁt share, 
discretionary bonus and employer’s national insurance contributions have been 
added back to reﬂect the fact that following Listing on 31 July 2007 these elements 
of compensation no longer apply to these individuals. 
Share option charges relating to Directors, senior management and other 
employees of the Group have been added back to calculate adjusted EBITDA.  
Prior to the acquisition of Moneysupermarket.com Financial Group Limited by the 
Company, Moneysupermarket.com Financial Group Limited issued share options  
to employees on terms that will not be offered moving forwards. On Listing, the 
Company also issued ‘free’ shares to the value of £3,000 as a ‘bonus’ to each eligible 
employee as part of its Share Incentive Plan scheme. On listing, the Company  
also entered into an agreement with Gerald Corbett under which Gerald Corbett 
purchased 117,647 ordinary shares in the Company and provided he completes three 
years service as Chairman of the Company from listing and he retains those ordinary 
shares he purchased, he will be entitled to subscribe at nominal value for 235,294 
ordinary shares in the Company. The Company does not currently intend to make 
similar awards in the future. It does however anticipate making conditional share 
awards under the terms of the Company’s Long Term Incentive Plan in the future to 
key staff on commercial terms. Conditional awards were made under the Company’s 
Long Term Incentive Plan on 28 December 2007. No charge is included in the pro 
forma results in either 2006 or 2007.

Overview of ﬁnancial performance
Revenues grew strongly by 55.9% to £162.9m (2006: £104.5m) and adjusted EBITDA by 
57.2% to £52.9m (2006: £33.7m). The internet business generated £152.2m of revenues 
representing 93.5% of turnover in the year to 31 December 2007 compared to £93.0m in 
the corresponding period which represented 89.0% of turnover.
Group gross margins increased over the period from 61.1% to 66.7%, partly as a result of 
a more favourable mix, as the lower margin intermediary business contributed 6.5% of 
Group revenues in 2007 compared to 11.0% in 2006. The Group also saw direct-to-site 
revenues increase as a proportion of total revenues over the period. The Directors’ 
believe that the improvement in direct-to-site revenues has been driven by increased 
brand awareness supported by continued investment in brand building including 
television advertising which commenced in March 2006, and a focus on Search Engine 
Optimisation (SEO) which has helped to maintain and improve the Group’s rankings in 
the free listings in the major search engines for key search terms.
The adjusted cost base before depreciation increased from £30.3m to £55.7m. Much of 
the increase is attributable to an increase in distribution expenses which consist 
primarily of television advertising, marketing and PR expenses. These have grown 
signiﬁcantly from £7.4m in 2006 to £19.6m in 2007. Television advertising did not 
commence until March 2006 and the 2007 results therefore include a full year’s activity 
compared to 10 month’s in 2006. However, throughout 2007 we increased the level of 
advertising activity. The success of this has been demonstrated by a signiﬁcant 
improvement in online brand recognition from 40% in July 2006 to 73% in November 
2007 as measured by a YouGov survey regularly commissioned by the Group. 
Administration costs have also increased substantially. Headcount increased from 523 
to 647 over the period, primarily in IT and operations, as work continues on improving 
our consumer offering and the development of new products and services. Adjusted 
staff costs increased by £6.6m to £22.8m in 2007.
Other costs including irrecoverable VAT increased by £7.1m driven by a change in sales 
mix towards sales which were exempt from VAT together with an increase in outsourced 
call centre costs associated with the growth in the sale of insurance leads. Included in 
the adjusted cost base is £1.0m of costs that relate to the launch of our German 
business, www.icero.de, in October 2007.
Adjusted EBITDA margins improved from 32.2% in 2006 to 32.5% in 2007.
The Group operates two different business segments in the UK (internet and 
intermediary). The internet business operates across four vertical markets. These are

Internet business
The UK internet business accounted for 93% of Group revenues. The Directors use key 
performance indicators (‘KPIs’) to assess the performance of the internet business 
against our strategy. These are reviewed on a regular basis. The principal KPIs for the 
internet business are as follows:
Visitors 
The Group measures the number of visitors to its website as the number of unique 
visitors per day per channel, measured on a cumulative basis using cookie-based 
tracking methodologies.
Number of transactions
The Group measures transactions at the point in time that the consumer leaves its 
website having clicked through to a third party website, or in some cases having 
completed an application form hosted on the Group’s website.
Revenue per visitor (‘RPV’)
The Group measures the total revenue (including click and other internet revenue) 
divided by the number of visitors deﬁned above.
Revenue per transaction (‘RPT’)
The Group measures the click based revenue divided by the total number  
of transactions.
The relative performance of each of the internet verticals is discussed below:
Money
The Money vertical currently offers the consumer the ability to search for and compare 
ﬁnance products for business ﬁnance, credit cards, current accounts, mortgages, loans, 
debt solutions and savings accounts. It also includes elements of the Group’s lead 
business (PAA) and advisory business (MCAT) together with advertising revenues that 
derive from money products.
The KPIs for the Money vertical are shown below:
  31 December 31 December  
  2007 2006 Change
Visitors (000)  27,676 23,152 20%
Transactions (000)  12,557 11,006 14%
Revenue (£000) – click based revenue  60,779 37,714 61%
Revenue (£000) – other  17 ,251 14,754 17%
Revenue (£000) – total  78,030 52,468 49%
RPV  £2.82 £2.27
RPT  £4.84 £3.43
Revenues in the Money vertical in total have increased by 49% from £52.5m to £78.0m 
and transaction revenue by 61% from £37.7m to £60.8m. Growth has been driven by 
both an increase in visitors of 20% and a shift in sales mix away from unsecured lending 
towards secured lending products. These generate higher revenues for the Group and 
this has signiﬁcantly improved average RPT and RPV in the Money vertical which have 
increased by 41% and 24% respectively. The Group saw little impact on the reported 
results from the volatility of the credit markets in 2007.

Other revenues grew 17% in the period broadly in line with visitor growth. This includes 
revenues from the sale of leads through PAA, commission based sales through MCAT 
for mortgages and loans, and advertising revenues. 
Insurance
The Insurance vertical currently offers the consumer the ability to search and compare 
insurance quotations for breakdown, dental, home, life, medical, mortgage payment 
protection, motor, payment protection, pet and travel insurance. It also includes 
elements of the Group’s lead business (PAA) and advisory business (MCAT) together 
with advertising revenues that derive from insurance products.

RPV  £2.63 £2.33
RPT  £3.51 £3.08
Revenue in the Insurance vertical increased by 75% from £31.1m to £54.4m and 
transaction revenue grew by 70% from £27.5m to £46.7m. RPT increased 14% to £3.51  
as consumer sales conversion improved on provider websites in respect of home and 
motor insurance driven by upgrades in the search functionality on the website. For 
example an enhanced question set was added to motor insurance in July 2007 which 
enabled consumers to obtain a more tailored quote for their particular circumstances, 
further increasing conversion on the providers’ websites. This improved RPT in the 
motor insurance channel.
Other revenues increased by 111% with the launch of the leads bidding system which 
enabled motor and home leads to be retailed on the Group’s online bidding platform.
Travel
The Travel vertical currently offers the consumer the ability to search for and compare 
airport parking, car hire, ﬂights, hotels and package holidays.
 
The KPIs for the Travel vertical are shown below:
  31 December 31 December  
  2007 2006 Change

Revenue (£000) – total  15,004 7,469 101%
RPV  £0.41 £0.38

Revenues in the Travel vertical have grown by 101% from £7.5m to £15.0m and 
transaction revenue by 92% from £6.8m to £13.1m. Visitors have grown by 87% over the 
period and each of RPT and RPV has increased by 8%. Car hire and hotels now account 
for a greater proportion of revenues in 2007 than 2006. There has also been some 
beneﬁt with the widening of the product portfolio late in 2006 which saw the launch of 
airport parking and a Top Deals promotion where consumers are periodically sent  15 Annual Report 2007 www.moneysupermarket.com
details of some of the best deals found on the website. The existing product set has 
been further developed in 2007 to include ﬂight sectors with B&Bs being added to the 
hotels offering. The increased product set and content has increased page impressions 
and has enabled the Group to generate greater advertising revenues which are shown 
within other revenues.
Home Services
The Home Services vertical was launched in 2006. It offers consumers the opportunity 
to search for and compare products for broadband, mobile telephone, shopping  
and utilities. 
The KPIs for the Home Services vertical are shown below

Revenue (£000) – total  4,540 1,194 280%
RPV  £0.79 £0.42
RPT  £2.56 £1.08
Revenues in the Home Services vertical have grown by 280% from £1.2m to £4.5m. 
Revenues in 2006 were predominantly generated from utilities which was a white 
labelled offering with content provided by a third party and the Group was 
remunerated on a cost per click basis. Late in 2006 the Group developed its own 
utilities offering, introduced a number of other channels and the majority of commercial 
deals migrated towards cost per action based arrangements. This increased RPV in 
2007 over 2006.
Germany
The German business launched in October 2007. It provides a range of products 
including home and motor insurance. Revenues were £0.2m and the Group incurred 
£1m in associated costs. The Group will focus in the coming months on how it can 
improve its product offering in Germany. 
1. As noted in the prospectus issued in connection with the Listing of the Company, the Group’s visitor 
numbers during the period between June 2006 and May 2007 were understated due to certain visitors not 
being assigned a unique global user ID. The issue was resolved in May 2007 and has not impacted visitor 
numbers in the Insurance vertical after May 2007. The Group has not been able to quantify the exact extent 
of the understatement.
2. The KPIs in respect of 2006 do not include the new car channel which was discontinued in the second half  
of 2006.

Intermediary business
Intermediary revenues declined from £11.5m to £10.7m over the period. In June 2006 
the Group disposed of its 50% shareholding in HL Partnership Limited, a network 
business. This contributed £0.8m of revenues in 2006 and nil proﬁt. Trading in the 
underlying business remained stable in 2007.
Acquisition of Moneysupermarket.com Financial Group Limited and Listing
As noted above, on 22 June 2007 the Company, at that time controlled by Simon Nixon, 
purchased the entire issued share capital of Moneysupermarket.com Financial Group 
Limited. This was funded partially by a cash payment of £162m to one of the founder 
shareholders, Duncan Cameron, and a share-for-share exchange. This transaction has 
had a number of impacts on the accounts of the Company in the current period and will 
also impact on subsequent periods. 
Goodwill and intangibles
The acquisition of Moneysupermarket.com Financial Group Limited gave rise to 
£125.0m of goodwill and the recognition of £207.2m of intangible assets. Individual 
intangible assets will be amortised over their useful lives (which are in the range of  
3-10 years) with a charge of £25.2m per annum in the ﬁrst three years in the full year 
accounts. A charge of £13.3m has been included in the accounts covering the period 
from 22 June 2007 to 31 December 2007. A full year’s charge of £25.2m has been 
included in the Pro Forma Income Statement for the years ended 31 December 2006 
and 31 December 2007.
Costs of transaction
The Company incurred total transaction costs relating to the acquisition of 
Moneysupermarket.com Financial Group Limited, the raising and draw down of  
the required ﬁnancing and the ﬂotation on the London Stock Exchange of £15.8m.
The Company incurred costs and stamp duty of £2.8m relating to the acquisition of 
Duncan Cameron’s shares in Moneysupermarket.com Financial Group Limited. These 
costs have been capitalised and recorded as a cost of investment on the Company’s 
balance sheet.
The acquisition of Duncan Cameron’s shares in Moneysupermarket.com Financial 
Group Limited was funded by an all senior debt facility of £150m. The Company 
incurred costs of £3.6m directly associated with the raising and draw down of the loan 
facility. The debt was repaid from the proceeds of the listing on 31 July 2007. The costs 
have therefore been expensed in the current period and shown as a ﬁnance charge in 
the statutory accounts. The Pro Forma Income Statement has been prepared on a debt 
free basis and consequently there have been no costs recognised in it in respect of the  
debt raised.
The remaining balance of £9.4m relates to costs incurred in relation to the listing of the 
Company. These costs have been written off against the share premium account.

Treasury and funding
The Company raised £180m from the proceeds of the listing on 31 July 2007. 
Approximately £178m of the proceeds raised were used to fund the costs of the 
acquisition by the Company of Duncan Cameron’s shares in Moneysupermarket.com 
Financial Group Limited including all related costs and expenses of the acquisition,  
the raising and draw down of debt ﬁnance and the costs of the listing. The Company 
acquired £14m of cash at the acquisition and has continued to generate cash from 
operations. It has no debt. The Company had cash balances of £54.0m at 31 December 
2007. The Company has invested its cash over the period predominantly in instant 
access cash deposits and short-term deposits (less than six months). As such the 
interest earned has closely followed movements in the Bank of England base rate. 
Dividend
The Directors currently intend to adopt a progressive dividend policy, initially targeting 
a dividend payout of approximately one third of net income each year, payable by way 
of an interim and ﬁnal dividend each year.
The Board is declaring a ﬁnal dividend, subject to shareholder approval, consistent  
with the policy above in respect of the period ended 31 December 2007, of two thirds 
of the annual targeted payout ratio, representing one third of adjusted net income.  
This equates to £8.1m and represents 1.63p per ordinary share. The ex-dividend  
date is 19 March 2008, with a record date of 25 March 2008 and a payment date  
of 30 April 2008.
Tax
The Group tax credit of £1.8m in the statutory Income Statement represents an 
effective tax rate of –25.2%. This is signiﬁcantly below the prevailing rate for the period 
of 30%. The current year rate has been impacted by a number of items. The deferred 
tax liability relating to the intangible assets has been revalued to reﬂect the change in 
corporation tax rates from 30% to 28% from 5 April 2008. This has generated a credit in 
the current period to tax of £3.7m. The Group has also recognised a deferred tax credit 
of £1.7m relating to share based payments arising from shares and options issued prior 
to the listing. In future the Group expects the underlying effective rate of tax to revert 
to close to the standard UK corporation tax rate of 28%.
Earnings per ordinary share
Basic statutory earnings per ordinary share for the period to 31 December 2007
were 3.0p. Details can be found in Note 9 of the ﬁnancial statements. Pro forma basic 
earnings per ordinary share increased from 4.7p to 7.5p per share. The pro forma 
earnings per ordinary share is based on adjusted EBITDA after deducting depreciation 
and adding estimated interest income for each period to calculate pro forma proﬁt 
before tax. A tax rate of 30% has been applied to calculate pro forma proﬁt after tax. 18 www.moneysupermarket.com Annual Report 2007

This is the ﬁrst time the Group has commented on its role as a 
corporate citizen although the Group has always operated with 
an underlying awareness of its wider responsibilities.
Communities and charities
The Group recognises it has a responsibility to support the 
development of local communities and has fostered links with 
them over a number of years through its donations to local 
charitable causes. In August each year, employees vote for their 
choice of local charity for the following 12 months. Various events 
are then held within the Group during that year to raise money 
for that charity. The Group matches amounts raised by 
employees from those events.
Between August 2006 and July 2007, a total of £8,185 was 
donated by the Group to Capricorn Animal Rescue, a local  
Welsh charity which cares for animals.
The current Group Charity of the Year is BIRD (Brain Injury

with neurological impairment. As at 31 December 2007, £2,425

Environment
The Group strives to reduce energy and raw material usage to 
support environmental and ﬁnancial performance. The Group 
currently provides facilities for paper to be recycled and utilises 
energy saving systems in its ofﬁces.
The Group has chosen not to set environmental key performance 
indicators due to its relative size and the limited impact it has on 
the environment.
Employees
The Group actively encourages employee involvement and 
consultation and places emphasis on keeping its employees 
informed of the Group’s activities by regular brieﬁngs and the 
circulation to employees of relevant information including 
corporate announcements and the Group newsletter.
Corporate Responsibility Report
The Group is committed to an equal opportunities policy. The 
Group aims to ensure that no employee is discriminated against, 
directly or indirectly, on the grounds of colour, race, ethnic and 
national origins, nationality (citizenship), sex, sexual orientation 
or gender, marital status, disability, religion or belief, being part 
time or on the grounds of age.
The Group recognises the importance of health and safety and 
the positive beneﬁts to the Group. Therefore our commitment to 
health and safety makes good business sense.
The Group has a health and safety policy which is communicated 
to all employees through a health and safety handbook. The 
health and safety handbook is regularly reviewed and updated.
Supporting students
In order to build links between the Group and schools and 
colleges, the Group offers work experience and placements to 
students. In doing so, we strive to make work placements 
positive, challenging and relevant to participants’ current studies 
and their future job prospects.

to their needs.
To maintain high levels of consumer satisfaction, the Group is 
constantly assessing the views of its consumers and undertaking 
consumer testing of its website. The Group provides consumers 
with information from a variety of sources such as editorial 
content, consumer and expert reviews, forums and community 
features to enrich their shopping experience.

Corporate Governance Report
Moneysupermarket.com Group PLC (the ‘Company’) was incorporated on 14 March 2007. The Company became the holding 
company of the Moneysupermarket.com group (the ‘Group’) when it acquired the entire issued share capital of Moneysupermarket.
com Financial Group Limited and its subsidiaries on 22 June 2007. The Company was admitted to the Ofﬁcial List and to trading on 
the London Stock Exchange on 31 July 2007 (‘Listing’).
The Board of Directors (the ‘Board’) of the Company is committed to high standards of corporate governance. The requirements of 
the Combined Code on Corporate Governance published in June 2006 by the Financial Reporting Council (the ‘Combined Code’) 
ﬁrst applied to the Company on Listing on 31 July 2007. In the period between the incorporation of the Company and Listing, the 
Company was not required to comply with the Combined Code. It is the Board’s view that, throughout the period from Listing until 
31 December 2007, it complied with the Combined Code except as set out below. 
Board of Directors
The Board currently has ﬁve members, comprising the Non-Executive Chairman, Gerald Corbett, two Independent Non-Executive 
Directors, Michael Wemms and Rob Rowley, and two Executive Directors, Simon Nixon and Paul Doughty. All of the Directors bring 
strong judgement to the Board’s deliberations. The Board is of sufﬁcient size and diversity that the balance of skills and experience 
is considered to be appropriate for the requirements of the Group.
In anticipation of Listing, the Board appointed Gerald Corbett and Michael Wemms as Directors on 28 June 2007 and 10 July 2007 
respectively. Michael Wemms was designated as the Senior Independent Non-Executive Director. With effect from Rob Rowley’s 
appointment as a Non-Executive Director on 19 September 2007, half of the Board, excluding the Chairman, comprised Non-
Executive Directors.
The Board considers that all the Directors are able to devote sufﬁcient time to their duties as Directors. Biographies of the Board  
are set out on page 20 including details of the signiﬁcant commitments of the Chairman. In the period to 31 December 2007,  
Gerald Corbett has ceased to be chairman of Woolworths Group plc.
The Board considers that Gerald Corbett was independent on appointment and considers Michael Wemms and Rob Rowley to be 
independent, being independent in character and judgement and free from relationships or circumstances which are likely to affect, 
or could appear to affect, their judgement. When determining the Chairman’s independence on appointment, the Board had regard 
to his share award (‘Share Award’). Under the Share Award, Gerald Corbett purchased ordinary shares in the Company on Listing at 
£1.70 per ordinary share to the value of £200,000 and provided he completes three years’ service as Chairman of the Company from 
Listing and retains the ordinary shares he purchased on Listing during that three year period, he will be entitled to subscribe at 
nominal value for two times the number of ordinary shares he purchased on Listing. The Board believes that the number of ordinary 
shares subject to the Share Award is not sufﬁcient to have an impact on his independence and thus concludes that the Chairman 
was independent on appointment. Shareholder approval was obtained prior to the entry by the Company into the Share Award.
To enable the Non-Executive Directors to more freely discuss the performance of the Group’s management, the Chairman meets 
with the Non-Executive Directors at least once each year without the Executive Directors present.
The Directors have direct and unfettered access to the advice and services of the Company Secretary. Both the appointment and 
removal of the Company Secretary are matters for the Board as a whole. The Company Secretary is responsible for good information 
ﬂow, ensures that Board procedures are complied with and provides advice to the Board on corporate governance. Directors can, 
where they judge it necessary to discharge their responsibilities as Directors, obtain independent professional advice at the 
Company’s expense. Furthermore, Directors have the right to request that any concerns they may have are recorded in the 
appropriate Board or Committee minutes.
The practice of the Company is to appoint Non-Executive Directors for speciﬁed terms of three years, subject to a maximum of up 
to 12 months’ notice within that period and also subject to re-election and to Companies Act provisions relating to the removal of  
a Director. Each of the Non-Executive Directors, including the Chairman, currently holds a letter of appointment reﬂecting this. 
Simon Nixon and Paul Doughty were appointed Directors of the Company on 12 April 2007. With effect from Listing, they each 
entered into new service agreements with the Company which provides for 12 months’ notice to be given by either the Director  
or the Company.
The Company’s Articles of Association require that new Directors appointed by the Board must submit themselves for re-election  
by shareholders at the next Annual General Meeting following their appointment. Each of the present Directors were appointed by 
the Board on or after the Company’s incorporation on 14 March 2007 and therefore retires and offers himself for re-election at the 
forthcoming Annual General Meeting.
The Company’s Articles of Association require that all Directors stand for re-election at intervals of not more than three years. 
However, in view of the date upon which all Directors were ﬁrst appointed, this provision of the Articles of Association has no 
practical effect in relation to the forthcoming Annual General Meeting, but it will be applied in future years. The Board will conﬁrm 
to shareholders when proposing the re-election of a Director in the future that the Director’s performance continues to be effective 
and that the Director continues to demonstrate commitment to the role.
Our Governance 24 www.moneysupermarket.com Annual Report 2007
The positions of Chairman and Chief Executive Ofﬁcer are not combined, ensuring a clear division of responsibility at the head of 
the Company. The division of roles and responsibilities between the Chairman and Chief Executive Ofﬁcer is clearly established, set 
out in writing and was agreed by the Board on 27 November 2007. 
All members of the Board take collective responsibility for the Group’s performance. The Board has adopted a schedule of matters 
reserved to it for decision making and matters delegated to Committees of the Board which are available on the Company’s website 
at www.moneysupermarket.com. The Board determines the Group’s strategy; risk management policies; business plan and annual 
operating budget; acquisitions and disposals and other major investments and capital projects; accounting policies and changes 
thereto; dividend policy; shareholder communications; prosecution, defence or settlement of material litigation; remuneration 
policy; the terms of reference of Board committees; and Board structure, composition and succession. 
The Board has delegated through the Chief Executive Ofﬁcer and the Chief Financial Ofﬁcer appropriate responsibilities to the 
Executive Management Team who are responsible for the day-to-day running of the Group, carrying out agreed strategy and 
implementing speciﬁc Board decisions relating to the operation of the Group.
The Company provides Directors’ and ofﬁcers’ insurance cover for the beneﬁt of Directors in respect of claims arising in the 
performance of their duties.
Relationship Agreement
The majority shareholder of the Company is Simon Nixon. Simon Nixon has considerable knowledge and experience of the price 
comparison market. Accordingly, the other Directors believe that his membership of the Board and participation in the management 
of the Company is important to the continued success and growth of the Company. 
The Company and Simon Nixon entered into a relationship agreement on 11 July 2007 to regulate the ongoing relationship between 
the Company and Simon Nixon (the ‘Relationship Agreement‘). The principal purpose of the Relationship Agreement is to ensure 
that the Company is capable of carrying on its business independently of Simon Nixon, and that transactions and relationships with 
Simon Nixon are at arm’s length and on normal commercial terms.
The Company and Simon Nixon have agreed in the Relationship Agreement that Simon Nixon is entitled to appoint (such number 
including himself as a Director) one Non-Executive Director for as long as he holds the beneﬁcial interest in at least 15% of the 
ordinary shares in the Company, two Non-Executive Directors for as long as he holds the beneﬁcial interest in at least 30% of the 
ordinary shares in the Company and three Non-Executive Directors for as long as he holds the beneﬁcial interest in at least 50% of 
the ordinary shares in the Company. The Relationship Agreement will terminate if Simon Nixon holds less than 15% of the ordinary 
shares in the Company.
The Relationship Agreement also includes a protocol to be observed in relation to any Non-Executive Director appointed by  
Simon Nixon to deal with potential conﬂicts of interest and the provision of conﬁdential information.
As at 31 December 2007, Simon Nixon had not appointed any Non-Executive Directors pursuant to his rights in the  
Relationship Agreement.
Board Committees
The Board has three principal Committees (Audit, Nomination and Remuneration) to which various matters are delegated. The 
Committees all have formal written terms of reference that have been approved by the Board which are published on the Company’s 
website at www.moneysupermarket.com and which are available in hard copy form on application to the Company Secretary.
The Directors who served on each of the Committees from Listing to 31 December 2007, and their dates of appointment to those 
Committees, are set out below:
Committee Chairman Member Member
Audit Rob Rowley Gerald Corbett Michael Wemms
 (19 September 2007) (19 September 2007) (19 September 2007)

Details of the work of the Audit, Nomination and Remuneration Committees are given in the reports of those Committees on pages 
28 to 35.
Board and Committee attendance
The Board meets regularly to review the affairs and trading progress of the Group. If and when required, meetings in addition to
the scheduled meetings are held either in person or by telephone conference. The Board intends to meet at least eight times in 
each year.

The number in brackets represents the maximum number of meetings in the period that each individual Director was entitled  
to attend.
The Executive Directors of the Company may attend meetings of the Committees at the invitation of the Chairman of the  
respective Committees.
The Chairman and the Non-Executive Directors met without the Executive Directors being present. 
Performance reviews and Directors’ development
The Board has only recently been established with its current membership and it would be premature to conduct any evaluation  
of the Board until it has been in place for one year. It is therefore the intention of the Board to undertake formal evaluation of its  
own performance, of its Committees and of individual Directors in 2008. The Senior Independent Non-Executive Director will  
be responsible for conducting the evaluation of the Chairman’s performance.
During the period ended 31 December 2007, each of the appointments of Gerald Corbett, Michael Wemms and Rob Rowley were 
made on merit and after a selection process conducted with the aid of third party executive search consultants.
The Chairman and Company Secretary are responsible for preparing and implementing an induction programme for Directors, 
including guidance as to their duties, responsibilities and liabilities as a Director of the Company and business familiarisation. 
Business familiarisation involves Directors visiting the Company’s ofﬁces and giving the Directors the opportunity to meet the 
Executive Management Team and other senior managers in the business. They also have the opportunity to discuss organisational, 
operational and administrative matters. Every Director has access to appropriate training as required subsequent to appointment. 
Shareholder relations
The Board is committed to maintaining good communications with shareholders. Senior executives, including the Chairman,  
Chief Executive Ofﬁcer and Chief Financial Ofﬁcer have dialogue with individual institutional shareholders in order to develop  
an understanding of their views which is fed back to the Board. General presentations are given to analysts and investors covering 
the annual and interim results. The Company Secretary generally deals with questions from individual shareholders.
The results and results presentations, together with all information reported to the market via a regulatory information service, press 
releases and other shareholder information, are published on the Company’s website at www.moneysupermarket.com to be viewed 
and accessed by all shareholders. 
The Senior Independent Non-Executive Director is available to shareholders if they have concerns which contact through the  
normal channels of Chairman, Chief Executive Ofﬁcer or Chief Financial Ofﬁcer have failed to resolve, or for which such contact  
is inappropriate.
All shareholders will have the opportunity to ask questions at the forthcoming Annual General Meeting and at all other times, by
e-mailing or writing to the Company. The Chairmen of the Audit, Nomination and Remuneration Committees will be available to 
answer questions at the forthcoming Annual General Meeting. Shareholders may also contact the Chairman, the Chief Executive 
Ofﬁcer or, if more appropriate, the Senior Independent Non-Executive Director to raise any issue with one or all of the Non-
Executive Directors of the Company. 
The Company will prepare separate resolutions on each substantially separate issue. The results of the votes on each resolution will 
be published on the Company’s website after the Annual General Meeting and will be announced via a regulatory information 
service.
In the period prior to Listing, the Executive Directors met on a number of occasions with a large number of prospective shareholders 
of the Company.
Internal control and risk management
The Board has overall responsibility for the Group’s system of internal control and risk management and for reviewing its 
effectiveness. The system of internal control is designed to manage, rather than eliminate, the risk of failure to achieve business 
objectives and can only provide reasonable, and not absolute, assurance against material misstatement or loss. There are inherent 
limitations in any system of internal ﬁnancial control and accordingly even the most effective system can provide only reasonable, 
and not absolute, assurance with respect to the preparation of ﬁnancial information and safeguarding of assets.
Our Governance 26 www.moneysupermarket.com Annual Report 2007
The Board reviews the reports from the Executive Management Team meetings, which are held shortly before a Board meeting, to 
consider whether signiﬁcant risks are identiﬁed, evaluated, managed and controlled and whether any signiﬁcant weaknesses are 
promptly remedied and indicate a need for more extensive monitoring. 
Board members are given appropriate documentation in advance of each Board or Committee meeting. This normally includes a 
detailed report on current trading, a ﬁnancial review and full papers on matters where the Board or Committee will be required to 
make a decision or give its approval. Speciﬁc business related presentations are given when appropriate. Additionally, the Board 
considers reports from the Executive Management Team. This ensures the Board are briefed on the latest developments and are 
able to make fully informed decisions.
There is an established procedure for the preparation and review, at least annually, by the Board of business plans and the annual 
budget. The Board receives regular reports on performance against the business plan and budget each time it meets. This 
information enables business performance to be monitored, evaluated, discussed and challenged where necessary and enables 
informed, sound decisions to be made.
Prior to Listing and as part of the Listing process, the Board documented and reviewed the effectiveness of the Group’s system of 
internal controls.
The Board meeting held in October 2007 was combined with a two day strategy event to highlight, evaluate and address the key 
risks facing the Group using an external independent facilitator. The Executive Management Team were invited to join the strategy 
event to present to the Board and participate in discussions. Action plans have been developed following the strategy event to 
address and manage the key risks facing the Group.
The Group’s internal controls are further strengthened by an established governance framework including matters reserved to the 
Board and the terms of reference of each of its Committees.
The Board is reasonably satisﬁed that effective controls are in place and that risks have been managed to an acceptable level.
Compliance with the Combined Code
The Company was not required to comply with the Combined Code prior to Listing on 31 July 2007.
The Directors consider that during the period between Listing on 31 July 2007 and 31 December 2007, the Company complied with 
the Combined Code except as follows:
A.1.3/A.6.1 – Gerald Corbett was appointed Chairman of the Company with effect from 28 June 2007 and had not completed one 
year as Chairman before 31 December 2007. Led by the Senior Independent Non-Executive Director, the Non-Executive Directors 
will meet without the Chairman present in 2008 to appraise the Chairman’s performance. As at 31 December 2007, this appraisal had 
not taken place.
A.2.1 – The division of responsibilities between the Chairman and Chief Executive Ofﬁcer was clearly established, set out in writing 
and agreed by the Board at the Board meeting held on 27 November 2007. Prior to that date, the division of responsibilities 
between the Chairman and Chief Executive Ofﬁcer was not formally set out in writing.
A.3.2 – With effect from Rob Rowley’s appointment as a Non-Executive Director on 19 September 2007, at least half the Board, 
excluding the Chairman, comprised Non-Executive Directors determined by the Board to be independent. Prior to Rob Rowley’s 
appointment, excluding the Chairman, the Board comprised two Executive Directors and Michael Wemms who the Board 
determined to be independent. The Board considers that Gerald Corbett was independent on appointment as Chairman.
A.4.1 – With effect from Rob Rowley’s appointment as a Non-Executive Director on 19 September 2007, a majority of members of 
the Nomination Committee comprised independent Non-Executive Directors. Prior to that date, the Nomination Committee 
comprised Michael Wemms who the Board determined to be an independent Non-Executive Director, and Gerald Corbett. 
B.2.1 – The Remuneration Committee comprises Michael Wemms and Rob Rowley, both of whom the Board has determined to be 
Independent Non-Executive Directors, and Gerald Corbett. Accordingly, the Remuneration Committee does not comprise at least 
three independent Non-Executive Directors. 
C.2.1 – In 2007, prior to Listing and as part of the Listing process, the Board documented and reviewed the effectiveness of the 
Group’s system of internal controls. In the period between Listing on 31 July 2007 and 31 November 2007 the Board did not conduct 
a further review of the effectiveness of the Group’s system of internal controls. In November 2007, the Audit Committee commenced 
a review of the effectiveness of the Group’s system of internal controls which will be concluded during 2008.
Corporate Governance Report continued
Our Governance 27 Annual Report 2007 www.moneysupermarket.com
C.3.1 – The Audit Committee was established on 19 September 2007 following the appointment of Rob Rowley as a Non-Executive 
Director. With effect from Rob Rowley’s appointment as a Non-Executive Director, the Audit Committee has comprised Rob Rowley 
and Michael Wemms, both of whom the Board has determined to be independent Non-Executive Directors, and Gerald Corbett. 
Accordingly, the Audit Committee does not comprise at least three independent Non-Executive Directors. 
C.3.4 – In 2007, prior to Listing and as part of the Listing process, the Board reviewed arrangements by which staff of the Group may, 
in conﬁdence, raise concerns about possible improprieties in matters of ﬁnancial reporting or other matters. These arrangements 
formed part of the Employee Handbook of the Group during 2007. In the period between the establishment of the Audit Committee 
on 19 September 2007 and 31 December 2007, the Audit Committee did not undertake such a review although it scheduled a review 
for 2008. On 19 February 2008, the Audit Committee reviewed the arrangements by which staff of the Group may, in conﬁdence, 
raise such concerns and approved a new policy to enable such concerns to be raised.
C.3.5 – Prior to Listing, the Board considered the need to establish an internal audit function and concluded that the control 
mechanisms at that time were sufﬁcient for the size and complexity of the Group, such that an internal audit function was not 
required. On 27 November 2007, the Audit Committee commenced a review of the effectiveness of, and the framework for, the 
Group’s system of internal control and risk management, which it will conclude during 2008. This review will include consideration  
of the need to establish an internal audit function.
 
D.1.1 – As a result of regular feedback provided to the Board by the Chief Executive Ofﬁcer, Chief Financial Ofﬁcer and Chairman 
following their dialogue with major shareholders, the Senior Independent Non-Executive Director believes he is aware of the views 
of major shareholders. Unless requested by major shareholders, the Senior Independent Non-Executive Director does not attend 
meetings with them.

Audit Committee Report
The Audit Committee presents a separate report in relation to the period from Listing until 31 December 2007. The Audit Committee 
was established on 19 September 2007 following the appointment of Rob Rowley as a Non-Executive Director of the Company.
Composition of the Audit Committee
The Audit Committee comprises the three Non-Executive Directors, Rob Rowley, Gerald Corbett and Michael Wemms. Rob Rowley 
and Michael Wemms are considered by the Board to be independent. Biographies of the members of the Audit Committee are set 
out on page 20. The Chairman of the Audit Committee, Rob Rowley, is a qualiﬁed accountant and formerly a ﬁnance director of 
Reuters plc and chairman of the audit committee at Prudential plc. The Board is satisﬁed that Rob Rowley has recent and relevant 
ﬁnancial expertise.
Operation of the Audit Committee
The Audit Committee met once between its establishment on 19 September 2007 and 31 December 2007. The attendance record of 
the Non-Executive Directors at the Audit Committee meeting is set out on page 25. Prior to the establishment of the Audit 
Committee, the external auditors presented to the Board on 13 September 2007 in relation to their work in conducting an interim 
review of the ﬁnancial results of the Company for the period ended 30 June 2007. 
The Chief Financial Ofﬁcer, together with the external auditors, will normally attend meetings at the invitation of the Chairman of  
the Audit Committee. The Company Secretary acts as secretary to the Audit Committee. The members of the Audit Committee  
can, where they judge it necessary to discharge their responsibilities, obtain independent professional advice at the Company’s 
expense. The external auditors may also request a meeting of the Audit Committee if they consider it necessary.
The Audit Committee’s duties include:
reviewing the Company’s ﬁnancial statements and the material ﬁnancial reporting judgements contained in them;
reviewing the Company’s internal ﬁnancial controls and the Company’s internal control and risk management systems; 
advising on the appointment and removal of external auditors and the remuneration and terms of engagement of the external auditors;
developing and implementing policy on the engagement of the external auditors to supply non-audit services; and
considering the requirement for an internal audit function.
The terms of reference of the Audit Committee are published on the Company’s website at www.moneysupermarket.com. 
The Audit Committee intends to undertake its activities in line with an annual work plan. The Audit Committee will receive reports 
from the external auditors and will hold discussions with the external auditors without management present. The Audit Committee 
will periodically review the Company’s procedures for handling allegations from employees who raise concerns about possible 
improprieties in matters of ﬁnancial reporting or other matters in order to ensure that arrangements are in place for the 
proportionate and independent investigation of such matters and for appropriate follow-up action.
In order that the Board is kept fully appraised of the Audit Committee’s work, the Chairman of the Audit Committee will report on 
the Audit Committee’s work at the next Board meeting. The Board will also receive a copy of the minutes of each meeting of the 
Audit Committee.

The Board is responsible for the Group’s system of internal control which includes risk management and for reviewing its 
effectiveness. The Audit Committee will monitor and undertake an annual review of the effectiveness of, and the framework for,  
the Group’s system of internal control and risk management. This will include annual consideration as to whether there is a need  
to establish an internal audit function.
Prior to Listing, the Board considered the need to establish an internal audit function and concluded that the control mechanisms  
at that time were sufﬁcient for the size and complexity of the Group such that an internal audit function was not required. On  
27 November 2007, the Audit Committee commenced a review of the effectiveness of, and the framework for, the Group’s  
system of internal control and risk management, which it will conclude during 2008. This review will include consideration  
as to whether there is a need to establish an internal audit function.
Review of the work of the external auditors
Subject to the annual appointment of the auditors by shareholders, the Audit Committee conducts a continuous review of the 
relationship between the Group and the auditors. This review includes:
the consideration of audit fees and advance approval of fees for non-audit related work;
the consideration of the external auditors’ independence and objectivity; and
the nature and scope of the external audit.
The Audit Committee, having considered the external auditors’ performance during their period in ofﬁce, recommends their  
re-appointment. A full breakdown of the audit and non-audit related fees is set out in note 5 to the ﬁnancial statements on page 51. 
The Audit Committee discussed the level of fees and considered them appropriate given the current size of the Group and the level 
of corporate activity undertaken by the Company during the ﬁnancial year, including the Listing. The Audit Committee believes the 
level and scope of non-audit services does not impair the independence and objectivity of the external auditors.

Directors’ Remuneration Report
This report has been prepared by the Remuneration Committee of the Board of the Company (the ‘Remuneration Committee‘) and 
approved by the Board for the period between incorporation of the Company on 14 March 2007 and 31 December 2007. It has been 
prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 1985 (as amended) and The Directors’ Remuneration Report Regulations 2002 (‘the 
Regulations‘). This report provides the Company’s statement of how it has applied the principles of good governance relating to 
Directors’ remuneration and is intended to communicate the Company’s policies and practices on executive remuneration.
As required by the Regulations, this report will be subject to an advisory shareholder vote at the forthcoming Annual General 
Meeting. KPMG Audit Plc have audited the content of the report described as ‘Audited Information‘ to the extent required by  
the Regulations.
Remuneration Committee
The Board constituted the Remuneration Committee on the admission of the Company to the Ofﬁcial List and to trading on the 
London Stock Exchange on 31 July 2007 (‘Listing‘). With effect from Listing, the Remuneration Committee has comprised solely of 
the Non-Executive Directors of the Company. Michael Wemms (Chairman of the Remuneration Committee) and Gerald Corbett 
became members of the Remuneration Committee from Listing. Rob Rowley became a member of the Remuneration Committee 
from his appointment as a Non-Executive Director on 19 September 2007. Each of Michael Wemms and Rob Rowley are 
independent Non-Executive Directors. Gerald Corbett was independent on his appointment as Chairman of the Company.
The Company Secretary acts as secretary to the Remuneration Committee. The members of the Remuneration Committee  
can, where they judge it necessary to discharge their responsibilities, obtain independent professional advice at the  
Company’s expense.
At the invitation of the Chairman of the Remuneration Committee, the Chief Executive Ofﬁcer, Chief Financial Ofﬁcer and  
Human Resources Director attend the meetings of the Remuneration Committee, except when their own remuneration is  
under consideration. No Director is involved in determining his own remuneration.
The Remuneration Committee met three times during the period between Listing and 31 December 2007. Details of the attendance 
at Remuneration Committee meetings are set out in the Corporate Governance Report on page 25. The Chairman of the 
Remuneration Committee reports the outcome of the meetings to the Board. The Board will also receive a copy of the minutes of 
each meeting of the Remuneration Committee.
The Remuneration Committee meets not less than twice a year and is responsible for: (i) determining and agreeing with the  
Board the framework and broad policy for the remuneration (including beneﬁts, pension arrangements and termination payments) 
of the Chairman, Executive Directors and the senior management of the Company; (ii) within the terms of the agreed framework  
and broad policy, determining the total individual remuneration package of each Executive Director, including, where appropriate, 
bonuses, incentive payments, share options and pension arrangements; and (iii) determining awards under the Company’s share 
option schemes.
The Remuneration Committee’s terms of reference are published on the Company website at www.moneysupermarket.com and are 
available in hard copy form on application to the Company Secretary.
Advisors
The Remuneration Committee has appointed MM&K Limited, who are independent remuneration consultants, as its principal 
advisor. The Remuneration Committee has taken advice from them in relation to executive remuneration matters and, in particular, 
awards under the Group’s Long Term Incentive Plan. MM&K Limited has no other connection or relationship with the Group. Prior
to Listing, MM&K Limited provided the Company with advice in relation to executive remuneration of the Executive Directors
and Executive Management Team. MM&K Limited provided no other services to the Group during the period ended
31 December 2007.
Remuneration policy
The remuneration policy with respect to the Executive Directors and the Executive Management Team has been designed to 
provide market competitive remuneration relative to UK listed companies of similar size and scope.
The principal objective of the remuneration policy is to provide remuneration in a form and amount to attract, retain and motivate 
Executive Directors and an Executive Management Team of appropriate calibre and experience which is essential to the future 
success of the Company. The importance of aligning the interests of the Executive Directors and Executive Management Team with 
the creation of shareholder value over both the short and long term is key to this objective. The Remuneration Committee believes 
that this requires:
the provision of mid-market base salaries and the opportunity to receive incentives, with appropriate leverage to reward 
sustained exceptional performance and support the future growth aspirations of the Company; and
a reward structure that places an equal emphasis on short term and long term performance to support operating performance 
and to reward sustained longer term performance.
The Company believes that in order to meet its remuneration objective, the remuneration of Executive Directors and the Executive 
Management Team should provide a balance between ﬁxed and variable (performance related) pay elements with a signiﬁcant 
proportion of potential total remuneration comprising performance related elements. 
The Remuneration Committee will, during 2008 and thereafter, constantly review the remuneration policy to ensure that it is 
sufﬁciently ﬂexible to take account of future changes in the Group’s business operations and environment, and recognises key 
developments in remuneration practice and alignment to shareholders’ interests.

Our Governance 31 Annual Report 2007 www.moneysupermarket.com
Components of remuneration
The potential components of the remuneration packages of the Executive Directors consist of a number of separate elements, 
namely base salary, a performance linked bonus, pension contributions, car allowance, Long Term Incentive Plan, Share Option 
Scheme and Share Incentive Plan. In addition, Paul Doughty will participate in the Simon Nixon Scheme which is further described 
on page 32. 
With effect from Listing, the remuneration of the Executive Directors and the Executive Management Team was established by 
reference to the remuneration offered to senior executives with similar roles in comparable UK listed companies. The Company took 
advice from MM&K Limited and market comparisons were made with the assistance of a speciﬁc survey commissioned from MM&K 
Limited. Prior to Listing, the remuneration of the Executive Directors was determined by the board of Moneysupermarket.com 
Financial Group Limited, the former parent company of the Group.
Base salary
Salaries for the Executive Directors and Executive Management Team will be reviewed annually in June to take account of market 
movement, individual contribution and increases elsewhere in the Company. Directors’ salaries and those of the Executive 
Management Team will be benchmarked each year against a selected group of comparable companies.
Performance related bonus
Targets for the Executive Directors for the period prior to Listing were approved by the board of Moneysupermarket.com Financial 
Group Limited, the former parent company of the Group and were aligned to internal targets and strategic business objectives.  
Up to 100% of salary was payable for the achievement of target revenue performance in the case of Simon Nixon and target proﬁt 
before tax performance in the case of Paul Doughty. Simon Nixon and Paul Doughty also participated in a proﬁt share scheme under 
which they were entitled to receive a share of the proﬁt of the Group. In addition, an amount of up to £150,000 per annum was 
payable to Paul Doughty on the achievement of target proﬁt before tax performance.
Targets for the Executive Directors and Executive Management Team for the period from Listing to 31 December 2007 were 
approved by the Board prior to Listing and were aligned to internal targets and strategic business objectives in substitution for 
previous bonus schemes. For the achievement of target revenue performance, up to £200,000 per annum was payable to Simon 
Nixon. For the achievement of target proﬁt before tax performance, up to £125,000 per annum was payable to Paul Doughty. Proﬁt 
before tax and revenue targets were chosen as they provided focus on the delivery of the Group’s ﬁnancial targets.
The bonus levels earned by the Executive Directors for the period from 22 June 2007 to 31 December 2007 are set out in the table 
on page 34. 
For 2008, the Remuneration Committee has decided that the target bonuses will be paid for achievement of performance measures 
based on EBITDA set at appropriately stretching levels and the achievement of certain objectives based on a balanced scorecard 
approach. Up to 125% of base salary for Simon Nixon and 100% of base salary for Paul Doughty is payable for the achievement of 
target performance. For the achievement of performance greater than target, the bonus amounts increase on a straight line basis 
according to a set formula. The Remuneration Committee has decided to use this measure as it is aligned to internal targets, 
strategic business objectives and to shareholders’ interests. 
Pension contributions
The Company operates a contributory money purchase pension scheme for the beneﬁt of its employees (including the Executive 
Directors). In all cases, base salary only is pensionable. The Company matches pension contributions up to 1% of base salary for the 
beneﬁt of its employees (including the Executive Directors). 
Car allowance
The Company provides a car allowance of £7,200 per annum for each of the Executive Directors. The amount of the car allowance is 
reviewed annually.
Long Term Incentive Plan
The Long Term Incentive Plan was approved by shareholders at the Company’s Extraordinary General Meeting held on 9 July 2007. 
Conditional free share awards are made by Appleby Trust (Jersey) Limited, as trustee of the Company’s Employee Beneﬁt Trust, 
following recommendations made by the Board. The awards normally vest at the end of a three year period, subject to the 
achievement of performance conditions and continued employment. The maximum award that can be made to an employee in any 
ﬁnancial year is the equivalent of 200% of an employee’s annual base salary, calculated on the basis of the market price of the 
Company’s shares prior to the date of grant. 
In the period ending 31 December 2007, awards under the Long Term Incentive Plan were made to 38 employees of the Group and 
were made over shares worth between 28% and 167% of an employee’s annual base salary. No awards were made to the Executive 
Directors in the period ending 31 December 2007. For 100% of the award to vest, the Company must achieve at least 100% of its 
cumulative adjusted EBITDA target for the ﬁnancial years 2008 to 2010 (inclusive). No award will vest for performance below 90% of 
this cumulative adjusted EBITDA target, with 50% of the award vesting for performance of 90% of this cumulative adjusted EBITDA 
target, increasing on a straight line basis to 100% of the award vesting. 
Our Governance 32 www.moneysupermarket.com Annual Report 2007
The Remuneration Committee has chosen a cumulative adjusted EBITDA target as the performance target for the initial awards 
under the Long Term Incentive Plan as this measure is aligned to internal growth targets and shareholders’ interests. The 
Remuneration Committee will meet after the three year plan period results are available to ascertain whether the performance 
conditions have been satisﬁed as determined by the audited ﬁnancial results of the Company and its subsidiaries for the period 
2008 to 2010 (inclusive).
Share option scheme
Prior to Listing, the Group operated the Moneysupermarket.com Financial Group Limited share option scheme. All options under 
this scheme were granted prior to Listing. The Group does not intend to grant any further options under this scheme. The options 
vest over a three year period from the date of grant subject to continued employment and will lapse on the earlier of the tenth 
anniversary of the date of grant and the date the option holder ceases to be employed by the Group. There are no performance 
conditions applicable to this share option scheme as it is a historic scheme used prior to Listing and principally as a means to retain 
key employees.
Share incentive plan
At the Company’s Extraordinary General Meeting held on 9 July 2007, shareholders approved the establishment of a new HMRC 
approved all employee share incentive plan (‘SIP’). The SIP provided all eligible employees with the opportunity to receive ‘free’ 
ordinary shares on Listing with a value as at the date of Listing of £3,000, and provides all employees with the opportunity to 
purchase ordinary shares using money deducted from their pre-tax salary on a monthly basis.
Simon Nixon Scheme
Simon Nixon is to establish an additional incentive arrangement for the beneﬁt of Paul Doughty and certain other members of the 
Executive Management Team. Payment under these arrangements will be settled by Simon Nixon in cash but will be linked to the 
value of a number of his ordinary shares. The awards will vest and be payable over a three year period, subject to the achievement of 
certain performance conditions and/or continued employment with the Group. Paul Doughty will receive a cash sum equal to the 
market value of up to 3,974,448 ordinary shares in the Company subject to continued employment on 31 July 2010 and/or the 
achievement of certain Group and individual targets in the ﬁnancial years 2008 to 2010.
Service agreements
The current policy is for Executive Directors’ service agreement notice periods to be normally no longer than 12 months.
The service agreements of the current Executive Directors and the letters of appointment of the Non-Executive Directors include 
the following terms:

There are no special provisions for Executive or Non-Executive Directors with regard to compensation in the event of loss of ofﬁce. 
In the event of the employment of an Executive Director being terminated, the Remuneration Committee would, having regard to 
the individual’s circumstances, pay due regard to best practice and take account of the individual’s duty to mitigate their loss.
The service agreements and letters of appointment are available for inspection by shareholders at the forthcoming Annual General 
Meeting and during normal business hours at the Company’s registered ofﬁce.

Statement of Directors’ responsibilities in respect of the Annual Report and the ﬁnancial statements
The Directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report and the Group and parent company ﬁnancial statements in 
accordance with applicable law and regulations.
Company law requires the Directors to prepare Group and parent company ﬁnancial statements for each ﬁnancial year. Under that 
law they are required to prepare the Group ﬁnancial statements in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the EU and applicable law 
and have elected to prepare the parent company ﬁnancial statements in accordance with UK Accounting Standards and applicable 
law (UK Generally Accepted Accounting Practice).
The Group ﬁnancial statements are required by law and IFRSs as adopted by the EU to present fairly the ﬁnancial position and the 
performance of the Group; the Companies Act 1985 provides in relation to such ﬁnancial statements that references in the relevant 
part of that Act to ﬁnancial statements giving a true and fair view are references to their achieving a fair presentation.
The parent company ﬁnancial statements are required by law to give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the parent company 
and of the proﬁt or loss of the parent company for that period.
In preparing each of the Group and parent company ﬁnancial statements, the Directors are required to:
select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently;
make judgements and estimates that are reasonable and prudent;
for the Group ﬁnancial statements, state whether they have been prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the EU;
for the parent company ﬁnancial statements, state whether applicable UK Accounting Standards have been followed, subject  
to any material departures disclosed and explained in the parent company ﬁnancial statements; and
prepare the ﬁnancial statements on the going concern basis unless it is inappropriate to presume that the Group and the parent 
company will continue in business.

Our Governance 39 Annual Report 2007 www.moneysupermarket.com
The Directors are responsible for keeping proper accounting records that disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the ﬁnancial 
position of the parent company and enable them to ensure that its ﬁnancial statements comply with the Companies Act 1985. They 
have general responsibility for taking such steps as are reasonably open to them to safeguard the assets of the Group and to 
prevent and detect fraud and other irregularities.
Under applicable law and regulations, the Directors are also responsible for preparing a Directors’ Report, Directors’ Remuneration 
Report and Corporate Governance Statement that comply with that law and those regulations.
Internal control
The Corporate Governance Report and Audit Committee Report on pages 23 to 28 includes the Board’s assessment following  
a review of internal controls and consideration of the guidance issued by the Turnbull Committee of the Institute of Chartered 
Accountants of England and Wales. 
Employees
The Group places considerable value on the involvement of its employees and consults with them on matters affecting them as 
employees and on the various factors affecting the performance of the Group. This ensures employees’ views can be taken into 
account in making decisions which are likely to affect their interests. Consultation is achieved through formal and informal meetings, 
regular brieﬁngs, publication of the Group newsletter and circulation to employees of results announcements and other corporate 
announcements. This also helps to achieve a common awareness on the part of employees of the ﬁnancial and economic factors 
affecting the performance of the Company and the Group.
All employees are able to participate in the Moneysupermarket.com Group PLC Share Incentive Plan which gives them the 
opportunity to purchase ordinary shares in the Company using money deducted from their pre-tax salary on a monthly basis.  
This helps develop employees’ interest in the performance of the Company.
The Group operates a non-discriminatory employment policy and full and fair consideration is given to applications for employment 
from disabled persons, where they have the appropriate skills and abilities, and to the continued employment of staff who become 
disabled, wherever reasonably practicable.
The Group encourages the continuous development and training of its employees and the provision of equal opportunities for the 
training and career development of disabled employees.
Further details of policies and initiatives are given in the Corporate Responsibility Report on page 22.
Borrowings
The Group borrowed £150,000,000 on 22 June 2007 at an interest rate of 7.595%. This amount was repaid by the Group in its entirety 
on 31 July 2007.
Financial instruments
It is the Group’s objective to manage its ﬁnancial risk so as to minimise the adverse ﬂuctuations in the ﬁnancial markets on the 
Group’s reported proﬁtability and cash ﬂow. The speciﬁc policies for managing each of the Group’s main ﬁnancial risk areas are 
detailed in note 17 to the ﬁnancial statements on page 56.

terms provided the supplier meets its obligations. The Company does not hold any trade creditor balances. 
Disclosure of information to auditors
The Directors who held ofﬁce at the date of approval of this report conﬁrm that, so far as they are each aware, there is no relevant 
audit information (as deﬁned in the Companies Act 1985) of which the Company’s auditors are unaware; and each such Director has 
taken all the steps that he ought to have taken as a Director to make himself aware of any relevant audit information, and to establish 
that the Company’s auditors are aware of that information.

Independent Auditors’ Report to the Members of

We have audited the Group and parent company ﬁnancial statements (the ‘ﬁnancial statements’) of Moneysupermarket.com Group 
PLC (the ‘Company’) for the period ended 31 December 2007 which comprise the Consolidated Income Statement, the 
Consolidated and parent company Balance Sheets, the Consolidated Cash Flow Statement, the Consolidated Statement of Changes 
in Equity and the related notes. These ﬁnancial statements have been prepared under the accounting policies set out therein. We 
have also audited the information in the Directors’ Remuneration Report that is described as having been audited. 
This report is made solely to the Company’s members, as a body, in accordance with section 235 of the Companies Act 1985. Our audit 
work has been undertaken so that we might state to the Company’s members those matters we are required to state to them in an 
auditor’s report and for no other purpose. To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility to anyone 
other than the Company and the Company’s members as a body, for our audit work, for this report, or for the opinions we have formed.
Respective responsibilities of Directors and auditors
The Directors’ responsibilities for preparing the Annual Report and the Group ﬁnancial statements in accordance with applicable 
law and International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the EU, and for preparing the parent company ﬁnancial 
statements and the Directors’ Remuneration Report in accordance with applicable law and UK Accounting Standards (UK Generally 
Accepted Accounting Practice) are set out in the Statement of Directors’ Responsibilities on pages 38 and 39.
Our responsibility is to audit the ﬁnancial statements and the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited in 
accordance with relevant legal and regulatory requirements and International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland).
We report to you our opinion as to whether the ﬁnancial statements give a true and fair view, and whether the ﬁnancial statements 
and the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited have been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies 
Act 1985 and, as regards the Group ﬁnancial statements, Article 4 of the IAS Regulation. We also report to you whether, in our 
opinion, the information given in the Directors’ Report is consistent with the ﬁnancial statements. The information given in the 
Directors’ Report includes that speciﬁc information presented in the Business Review that is cross referred from the Review of 
activities section of the Directors’ Report.
In addition we report to you if, in our opinion, the Company has not kept proper accounting records, if we have not received all the 
information and explanations we require for our audit, or if information speciﬁed by law regarding Directors’ remuneration and other 
transactions is not disclosed.
We review whether the Corporate Governance Report reﬂects the Company’s compliance with the nine provisions of the 2006 
Combined Code speciﬁed for our review by the Listing Rules of the Financial Services Authority, and we report if it does not. We are 
not required to consider whether the Board’s statements on internal control cover all risks and controls, or form an opinion on the 
effectiveness of the Group’s corporate governance procedures or its risk and control procedures.
We read the other information contained in the Annual Report and consider whether it is consistent with the audited ﬁnancial 
statements. We consider the implications for our report if we become aware of any apparent misstatements or material 
inconsistencies with the ﬁnancial statements. Our responsibilities do not extend to any other information.
Basis of audit opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland) issued by the Auditing Practices 
Board. An audit includes examination, on a test basis, of evidence relevant to the amounts and disclosures in the ﬁnancial 
statements and the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited. It also includes an assessment of the signiﬁcant 
estimates and judgements made by the Directors in the preparation of the ﬁnancial statements, and of whether the accounting 
policies are appropriate to the Group’s and Company’s circumstances, consistently applied and adequately disclosed.
We planned and performed our audit so as to obtain all the information and explanations which we considered necessary in order to 
provide us with sufﬁcient evidence to give reasonable assurance that the ﬁnancial statements, and the part of the Directors’ 
Remuneration Report to be audited are free from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or other irregularity or error. In 
forming our opinion we also evaluated the overall adequacy of the presentation of information in the ﬁnancial statements and the 
part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited.
Opinion
In our opinion:

1 Corporate information
The consolidated ﬁnancial statements of Moneysupermarket.com Group PLC for the period ended 31 December 2007 were 
authorised for issue in accordance with a resolution of the Directors on 25 February 2008. The Group ﬁnancial statements have  
been prepared and approved by the Directors in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by  
the EU (“Adopted IFRSs”). The Company has elected to prepare its parent company ﬁnancial statements in accordance  
with UK GAAP; these are presented on pages 60 to 64. 
2 Summary of signiﬁcant accounting policies
Basis of preparation
The ﬁnancial statements are prepared on the historical cost basis.
Use of estimates and judgements
The preparation of ﬁnancial statements requires management to make judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the 
application of accounting policies and the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income and expenses. Actual results may differ 
from these estimates.
Estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the 
period in which the estimate is revised and in any future periods affected.
In particular, information about signiﬁcant areas of estimation uncertainty and critical judgements in applying accounting policies 
that have the most signiﬁcant effect on the amount recognised in the ﬁnancial statements are described in the following notes:
Note 3 & 12 goodwill and other intangibles, including their amortisation and impairment
Note 14 accruals for legal cases
Note 18 share-based payments
Basis of consolidation
These consolidated ﬁnancial statements incorporate the ﬁnancial statements of Moneysupermarket.com Group PLC and  
its subsidiaries. 
Subsidiaries are entities controlled by the Group. Control exists when the Group has the power, directly or indirectly, to govern the 
ﬁnancial and operating policies of an entity so as to obtain beneﬁts from its activities. In assessing control, potential voting rights 
that are currently exercisable or convertible are taken into account. The ﬁnancial statements of subsidiaries are included in the 
consolidated ﬁnancial statements from the date that control commences until the date that control ceases.
Foreign currency
The consolidated ﬁnancial statements are presented in sterling, which is the Company’s functional and presentation currency.  
The functional currency of the foreign operation Icero GmbH is the euro. The income and expenses of the foreign operation are 
translated into sterling at an average exchange rate for the period in which the activity occurred. The assets and liabilities of the 
foreign operation are translated into sterling using exchange rates ruling as at the balance sheet date. The exchange difference 
arising upon translation is taken directly to a separate component of equity.
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at the reporting date are retranslated to the functional currency  
at the exchange rate at that date. Foreign currency differences arising on retranslation are recognised as a proﬁt or loss. 
Revenue
Internet business
The Group generates fees from internet lead generation (click based revenue), commissions from brokerage sales and advertising 
through a variety of contractual arrangements. The Group recognises click based revenues and associated costs in the period that 
the lead is generated. Brokerage commissions are recognised at the point of completion of the transaction with the consumer.  
Advertising revenue is recognised in the period when an advertisement is delivered to the end user.
Intermediary business
Commissions are recognised on completed transactions in the period that a transaction completes.
Revenue is recognised net of value added tax.
Property, plant and equipment
Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses.
Where parts of an item of property, plant and equipment have different useful lives, they are accounted for as separate items  
of property, plant and equipment.

Notes to the Financial Statements
(forming part of the ﬁnancial information) 46 www.moneysupermarket.com Annual Report 2007 Financial Statements
2 Summary of signiﬁcant accounting policies continued
Depreciation is charged to the Income Statement on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life of each part of an item of 
property, plant and equipment. Land is not depreciated. Assets under construction are not depreciated until brought into use. The 
estimated useful lives are as follows:
Buildings 50 years
Plant and equipment (including IT equipment) 3 years
Fixtures and ﬁttings 5 years
Ofﬁce equipment 5 years
The useful lives and depreciation rates are reassessed at each reporting date.
Intangible assets
Goodwill
Business combinations are accounted for using the acquisition accounting method. The excess of the cost of the business 
combination over the Group’s interest in the net fair value of the acquiree’s identiﬁable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities,  
is recognised in the balance sheet as goodwill and is not amortised.
After initial recognition, goodwill is measured at cost less any accumulated impairment losses, with the carrying value being 
reviewed for impairment at least annually, and whenever there is an indication that the carrying value may be impaired. 
Other intangible assets
The cost of other intangible assets acquired in a business combination is fair value as at the date of acquisition. After initial 
recognition, intangible assets are carried at cost less any accumulated amortisation and any accumulated impairment losses. All the 
Group’s intangible assets (other than goodwill) have been identiﬁed as having ﬁnite useful lives. As such, they are amortised over  
the useful economic life and assessed for impairment whenever there is an indication that the intangible asset may be impaired. The 
amortisation period and the amortisation method for an intangible asset with a ﬁnite useful life is reviewed at least at each ﬁnancial 
year end. The amortisation expense on intangible assets with ﬁnite lives is recognised in the Income Statement in the expense 
category consistent with the function of the intangible asset. The estimated useful lives are as follows:
Market-related 10 years
Customer relationships 7 years
Customer lists 3 years
Technology 3 years
Market-related intangible assets are deﬁned as those that are primarily used in the marketing or promotion of products and 
services, for example trademarks, tradenames and internet domain names.
Customer-related intangible assets consist of customer (provider) lists, customer (provider) contracts and relationships, and non-
contractual customer (provider) relationships. For accounting purposes, customer (provider) relationships and customer (provider) 
lists have been identiﬁed separately. Relationships with high-proﬁle customers (providers) provide the Group with prominence in the 
marketplace, create volume and trafﬁc on the website, and enhance the reputation of the brand. Customer (provider) lists allow the 
Group to undertake targeted marketing activities.
Technology-based intangible assets relate to innovations and technical advances such as computer software, patented and 
unpatented technology, databases and trade secrets.
Impairment
The carrying amounts of the Group’s assets are reviewed annually to determine whether there is any indication of impairment.  
If such indication exists, the asset’s recoverable amount is estimated.
An impairment loss is recognised whenever the carrying amount of an asset or its cash-generating unit exceeds its recoverable 
amount. Impairment losses are recognised in the Income Statement.
For the purposes of impairment reviews, the recoverable amount of the Group’s assets is taken to be the greater of their net 
realisable value and value in use. 
Research and development 
Expenditure on research activities, undertaken with the prospect of gaining technical knowledge and understanding, is charged  
to the Income Statement when incurred. Development expenditure is capitalised when it meets the criteria outlined in SIC 32. 
Expenditure that does not meet the criteria is expensed directly to the Income Statement.
Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash balances and call deposits. Bank overdrafts that are repayable on demand are included  
as a component of cash and cash equivalents for the purpose only of the Cash Flow Statement.
Employee beneﬁts
Deﬁned contribution plans
Obligations for contributions to deﬁned contribution pension plans are recognised as an expense in the Income Statement  
as incurred.
Notes to the Financial Statements continued 47 Annual Report 2007 www.moneysupermarket.com Financial Statements
2 Summary of signiﬁcant accounting policies continued
Share-based payment transactions
The share option programme allows certain Group employees to acquire shares of Moneysupermarket.com Group PLC; these 
awards are granted by Moneysupermarket.com Group PLC. The fair value of options granted is recognised as an employee expense 
with a corresponding increase in equity. The fair value is measured at grant date and spread over the period during which the 
employees become unconditionally entitled to the options. The fair value of the options granted is measured using the Black- 
Scholes model, taking into account the terms and conditions upon which the options were granted. The amount recognised as an 
expense is adjusted to reﬂect the actual number of share options that vest except where forfeiture is due only to share prices not 
achieving the threshold for vesting.
Short-term beneﬁts
Short-term employee beneﬁt obligations are measured on an undiscounted basis and are recognised in the Income Statement as 
the related service is provided.
A provision is recognised for the amount expected to be paid under short-term cash bonus or proﬁt sharing plans if the Group has a 
present legal or constructive obligation to pay this amount as a result of past service provided by the employee and the obligation 
can be estimated reliably.
Net ﬁnancing costs
Net ﬁnancing costs comprise interest payable and interest receivable, and are recognised in the Income Statement as they accrue, 
using the effective interest method. 
Dividends
Dividends payable to the Company’s shareholders are recognised as a liability and deducted from shareholders’ equity in the 
period in which the shareholders’ right to receive payment is established.
Taxation
Tax on the proﬁt or loss for the year comprises current and deferred tax. Tax is recognised in the Income Statement except to the 
extent that it relates to items recognised directly in equity, in which case it is recognised in equity.
Current tax is the expected tax payable on the taxable income for the year, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the 
balance sheet date, and any adjustment to tax payable in respect of previous years.
Deferred tax is provided on temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for ﬁnancial reporting 
purposes and the amounts used for taxation purposes. The following temporary differences are not provided for: the initial 
recognition of goodwill; the initial recognition of assets or liabilities that affect neither accounting nor taxable proﬁt other than  
in a business combination, and differences relating to investments in subsidiaries to the extent that they will probably not reverse  
in the foreseeable future. The amount of deferred tax provided is based on the expected manner of realisation or settlement  
of the carrying amount of assets and liabilities, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
A deferred tax asset is recognised only to the extent that it is probable that future taxable proﬁts will be available against which  
the asset can be utilised. 
A deferred tax liability was recognised in the period as 30% of the value of the intangible assets with ﬁnite lives which were 
generated upon the acquisition of Moneysupermarket.com Financial Group Limited, representing the tax effect of the amortisation 
of these assets in future periods. This liability will decrease in line with the amortisation of the related intangible assets, with the 
deferred tax credit recognised in the Income Statement in accordance with IAS 12. At the period end, this liability was revalued at 
the enacted corporation tax rate of 28%, this being the rate at which the liability will unwind.
Group management of capital
The Group’s objectives when managing capital are:
to safeguard the entity’s ability to continue as a going concern, so that it can continue to provide returns for shareholders and 
beneﬁts for other stakeholders; and
to provide an adequate return to shareholders by pricing products and services commensurately with the level of risk.
The Group sets the amount of capital in proportion to risk. The Group manages the capital structure and makes adjustments to it in 
the light of changes in economic conditions and the risk characteristics of the underlying assets. In assessing the level of capital all 
components of equity are taken into account, i.e. share capital and retained earnings and reserves (where applicable).
The Group has no debt as at 31 December 2007 and is not subject to externally imposed capital requirements; management of 
capital therefore focuses around its ability to generate cash from its operations. 
In order to maintain or adjust the capital structure, the Group may adjust the amount of dividends paid to shareholders, return 
capital to shareholders, issue new shares, or sell assets to raise funds.
The Group believes it is meeting its objectives for managing capital as funds are available for reinvestment where necessary as well 
as being in a position to make returns to shareholders where this is felt appropriate.

2 Summary of signiﬁcant accounting policies continued
Application of recently issued/amended IFRSs
A number of new standards, amendments to standards and interpretations are not effective for the year ended 31 December 2007, 
and have not been applied in preparing these consolidated ﬁnancial statements:
IFRS 8 – Operating Segments introduces the ‘management approach’ to segment reporting. IFRS 8, which becomes mandatory 
for the Group’s 2009 ﬁnancial statements, will require the disclosure of segment information based on the internal reports 
regularly reviewed by the Group’s Chief Operating Decision Maker in order to assess each segment’s performance and to 
allocate resources to them. Currently the Group presents segment information in respect of internet and intermediary segments. 
IFRIC 11 IFRS 2 – Group and Treasury Share Transactions requires a share-based payment arrangement in which an entity 
receives goods or services as consideration for its own equity instruments to be accounted for as an equity-settled share-based 
payments transaction, regardless of how the equity instruments are obtained. IFRIC 11 will become mandatory for the Group’s 
2008 ﬁnancial statements, with retrospective application required. It is not expected to have any impact on the consolidated 
ﬁnancial statements. 
IFRIC 12 Service Concession Arrangements provides guidance on certain recognition and measurement issues that arise in 
accounting for public-to-private service concessions arrangements. IFRIC 12, which becomes mandatory for the Group’s 2008 
ﬁnancial statements, is not expected to have any effect on the consolidated ﬁnancial statements. 
IFRIC 13 Customer Loyalty Programmes addresses the accounting by entities that operate, or otherwise participate in, customer 
loyalty programmes for their customers. It relates to customer loyalty programmes under which the customer can redeem credits 
for awards such as free or discounted goods or services. IFRIC 13, which becomes mandatory for the Group’s 2009 ﬁnancial 
statements, is not expected to have any impact on the consolidated ﬁnancial statements. 
IFRIC 14 IAS 19 – The Limit on a Deﬁned Beneﬁt Asset, Minimum Funding Requirements and their Interaction clariﬁes when 
refunds or reductions in future contributions in relation to deﬁned beneﬁt assets should be regarded as available and provides 
guidance on the impact of minimum funding requirements on such assets. IFRIC 14, which becomes mandatory for the Group’s 
2008 ﬁnancial statements, with retrospective application required, is not expected to have any impact on the consolidated 
ﬁnancial statements.
Amendment to IAS 1 – Presentation of Financial Statements requires presentation of all non-owner changes in equity either in  
a single statement of comprehensive equity, or in an income statement plus a statement of comprehensive equity. The amended 
standard, which will become effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2009 with earlier adoption permitted, 
will require a change in the presentation of the Group’s ﬁnancial statements.
Amendment to IAS 23 – Borrowing Costs requires an entity to capitalise borrowing costs directly attributable to an acquisition, 
construction, or production of a qualifying asset as part of the cost of the asset, removing the option to recognise the costs as an 
expense. The revised standard is effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2009. Its effect on the consolidated 
ﬁnancial statements can only be assessed when the standard is applied.
Amendment to IAS 27 – Consolidated and Separate Financial Statements requires changes to the accounting for a non-
controlling interest in and the loss of control of a subsidiary. The amendments, which are effective for annual periods beginning 
on or after 1 July 2009, and apply retrospectively, except in certain circumstances, are not expected to have any impact on the 
consolidated ﬁnancial statements.
Revised IFRS 3 – Business Combinations extends the scope of IFRS 3 to include business combinations involving only mutual 
entities, and to business combinations achieved by contract alone. The revised standard is effective for annual periods beginning 
on or after 1 July 2009. The carrying amount of any assets and liabilities that arose under business combinations prior to the 
application of IFRS 3 (2008) are not adjusted, and therefore the revised standard is not expected to have any impact on the 
consolidated ﬁnancial statements.
Exposure Draft for Proposed Amendment to IFRS 2 – Share-Based Payments will provide clarity that an entity that receives 
goods or services from a supplier would apply IFRS 2, even if the entity has no obligation to make the required share-based  
cash payments related to such goods or services. The amendment is not expected to have any impact on the consolidated 
ﬁnancial statements, although the share based payment charge may increase when the Simon Nixon Scheme is completed.

Goodwill on acquisition (note 12)        124,965
Total consideration        307,783
The fair value adjustments to intangible ﬁxed assets represent the fair values calculated by an independent third party as 
attributable to the Group’s marketing related intangible assets, customer relationships, customer lists and technology. The deferred 
tax liability represents the tax effect which will result from the amortisation of the intangible assets, calculated at 30% of their fair 
value. The deferred tax asset and trade payables adjustment represent the recognition of the tax effect of share based payments. 
The fair value adjustments will be ﬁnalised within 12 months of the acquisition date, in line with the requirements of IFRS 3.
The goodwill recognised on the acquisition is attributable mainly to the skills and technical talent of the acquired business’ 
workforce and expectations of the Group’s future performance.
The total cash element of the acquisition was £164,765,000 and comprised a cash payment and costs directly attributable to the 
acquisition. £162,000,000 was paid to acquire 40% of Moneysupermarket.com Financial Group Limited and there were £2,765,000  
of costs associated with the acquisition.
At the same time, shares in Moneysupermarket.com Financial Group Limited, representing 15% of share capital, with fair value of 
£60,750,000 were exchanged as part of the acquisition.
Subsequently, the 45,500 Moneysupermarket.com Financial Group Limited shares owned by Simon Nixon were exchanged for 
85,498 B ordinary shares in Moneysupermarket.com Group PLC. As this was a transaction between parties under common control,  
it is outside of the scope of IFRS 3 and the shares have been recorded at book value at the date of transaction.

The consideration has resulted in the recognition of a merger reserve for 15% of the fair value of assets acquired of  
£60,750,000, a merger reserve of £16,923,000 for 45% of the book value transferred from a company under common

From the date of acquisition, Moneysupermarket.com Financial Group Limited has contributed £18,869,000 to the net proﬁt  
of the Group.
If the combination had taken place at the beginning of the year, the proﬁt for the Group would have been £17,406,000 and  
revenue from continuing operations would have been £162,882,000.
4 Segmental information 
Business segments

Unrecognised tax losses
The Group has tax losses arising from the results of a foreign subsidiary of £143,360. Deferred tax assets have not been  
recognised in respect of these losses as they may not be used to offset taxable proﬁts elsewhere in the Group and they  
have arisen in a foreign subsidiary that may not make a proﬁt in the immediate future. There are a further £2,665,000  
of losses trapped within Moneysupermarket.com Group PLC which relate to the period before the acquisition of  
Moneysupermarket.com Financial Group Limited, and therefore may not be used to offset taxable proﬁts elsewhere  
in the Group. A deferred tax asset has not been recognised for these losses.

9 Earnings per share
Basic earnings per share 
Basic earnings per share amounts are calculated by dividing proﬁt for the year attributable to ordinary equity holders of the parent, 
by the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the period.
Diluted earnings per share
Diluted earnings per share amounts are calculated by dividing proﬁt attributable to ordinary equity holders of the parent, by the 
weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the period plus the weighted average number of ordinary shares 
that would be issued on the conversion of all dilutive potential ordinary shares into ordinary shares.

12 Intangible assets continued
During the period, the Group employed the services of an appropriately qualiﬁed and experienced independent third party to value 
the internet segment’s intangible assets. This valuation has been used as the carrying value for these assets. The intermediary 
segment was determined to have no intangible assets and, having generated a loss for the period of £114,000, to have little or no 
value. Accordingly, all the value of the Group was assigned to the internet segment which is considered to be one cash generating 
unit. The Group believes the most appropriate method by which to assess impairment of the internet segment is the quoted market 
price of the Group. At the balance sheet date, the market capitalisation of the Group exceeded the carrying value of the Group’s 
assets by 70%. The Group has also undertaken an impairment review to assess the unit’s value in use. This calculation has been 
based on the results for 2007, the Group budget for 2008 and a discount rate of 10% has been applied. This conﬁrmed no 
impairment charge is considered necessary.

expected exposure plus legal costs, having regard to specialist legal advice plus the nature of the claims.

17 Financial instruments
Interest rate risk
There is no signiﬁcant exposure to interest risk as the Group has no borrowings. 
The Group invests its cash in a range of cash deposit accounts with UK Banks. Interest earned therefore closely follows movements 
in Bank of England base rates. A movement of 1% in this rate would result in a difference in annual pre-tax proﬁt of £343,000 based 
on Group cash, cash equivalents and ﬁnancial instruments at 31 December 2007. At the balance sheet date, £49,854,000 was 
invested with Bank of Scotland, this being the most invested with any one bank.
Effective interest rates 
In respect of interest-earning ﬁnancial assets, the following table indicates their effective interest rates at the balance sheet date. 
  31 December 2007
        Effective 
        interest rate £000
Cash and cash equivalents       6.07% 54,015
Credit risk
Credit risk with respect to trade receivables is monitored on an ongoing basis by the credit control team and ﬁnance management. 
By value, over 90% of the Group’s revenue comes from blue chip companies. Most of the remaining customer base is subject to 
payment terms of one week collected by direct debits. At the balance sheet date, the ﬁve largest trade receivables, by customer, 
accounted for 16% of the total trade receivables balance, and the largest individual balance was £618,147.
Fair values
The Group’s ﬁnancial assets and liabilities are principally short term in nature, and therefore the fair value is not materially different 
from their carrying value.

Unapproved option scheme
Grant 1
On 22 May 2007 the holders of unapproved options in Moneysupermarket.com Financial Group Limited agreed to have their 
unapproved options replaced with options in Moneysupermarket.com Group PLC on similar terms to those that operated under the 
original scheme. Options over 1,460 shares were originally exchanged. Following the share sub-division on 9 July 2007 where each 
ordinary share was converted to 5,000 ordinary shares, the shares under option were subject to a similar sub-division. Following this, 
there were therefore 7,300,000 options in issue that related to the options in Moneysupermarket.com Financial Group Limited, 
exchanged for options in Moneysupermarket.com Group PLC.
These options were originally issued in Moneysupermarket.com Financial Group Limited on 9 May 2005 and vested on the earlier of 
a trade sale or a ﬂotation provided that in the event of a ﬂotation the options had been held for three years. The exercise price is 6p 
per share.
Grant 2
On 18 and 22 June 2007 Moneysupermarket.com Group PLC issued further unapproved options that entitled key management 
personnel and senior employees to acquire shares in Moneysupermarket.com Group PLC. Options were originally granted over 
1,243 shares, which following the subdivision referred to above, became 6,215,000 shares.
Options vest on the earlier of a trade sale or, subject to, a ﬂotation equally over a three year period on subsequent anniversaries 
from the date of issue. The exercise price is 6p per share.
Grant 3
Post the subdivision of shares referred to above, on 10 and 21 July 2007 Moneysupermarket.com Group PLC issued further 
unapproved options that entitled key management personnel and senior employees to acquire shares in Moneysupermarket.com 
Group PLC. Options were originally granted over 105,000 shares. Options vest on the earlier of a trade sale or, subject to, a ﬂotation 
equally over a three year period on subsequent anniversaries from the date of issue. The exercise price is 6p per share.
Share Incentive Plan scheme (SIP)
Upon Listing, the Company granted £3,000 of ordinary shares at the price of £1.70 to each eligible employee free of charge. If an 
employee leaves within one year, all of these ordinary shares are forfeit; between one and two years, 50% are forfeit; between two 
and three years, 20% are forfeit; and after three years, none are forfeit. 948,184 shares were issued under the Share Incentive Plan 
scheme in the year.
Long Term Incentive Plan scheme (LTIP)
On 28 December 2007, Moneysupermarket.com Group PLC made awards under the Moneysupermarket.com Group PLC Long Term 
Incentive Plan for senior employees. 
Under the plan, shares vest at the end of a three year period dependent upon the achievement of the cumulative adjusted EBITDA 
ﬁgure for the three ﬁnancial years from 2008 to 2010.
During the year, 1,220,215 shares options were granted, and none lapsed.
Chairman’s share award 
Gerald Corbett, the Chairman of Moneysupermarket.com Group PLC purchased 117,647 ordinary shares in the Retail Offer at the 
initial offer price of £1.70. Subject to him retaining these shares for three years and provided that he completes three years’ service 
as Chairman he shall be entitled to subscribe at nominal value for twice the number of shares he purchased in the Retail Offer.

The Group provides ofﬁce space and services to Abacus Permanent Limited and Virtual Processing Limited, companies which S J 
Nixon controls over 90% of the voting shares. The Group recharges these two companies rent and associated services at the same 
levels as it recharges wholly owned subsidiary companies. These rates are based on notional open market rents for similar ofﬁces in 
the locality. In addition the Group provides payroll services for these related companies, fully recovering salaries paid. In the normal 
course of trade with these related companies the Group both charges and is charged for mortgage procuration fees. The level of 
these fees is at arm’s length and mirrors the going rates in the open market.

The minority interest share of the loss for the period was £48,000. No liability has been recognised in the balance sheet, as there is 
no requirement for the minority interest to fund their share of the losses.
On 6 September 2007, Tim Heidfeld was appointed a director of Icero GmbH, a company that was at that time a wholly owned 
subsidiary of Moneysupermarket.com Financial Group Limited. On 27 December 2007, Moneysupermarket.com Financial Group 
Limited entered into a shareholder’s agreement with Tim Heidfeld pursuant to which Moneysupermarket.com Financial Group 
Limited transferred to Tim Heidfeld 10% of the shares of Icero GmbH in consideration for the payment by Tim Heidfeld to 
Moneysupermarket.com Financial Group Limited of €2,500. The shareholder’s agreement includes a contractual obligation on 
Moneysupermarket.com Financial Group Limited to acquire all the shares in Icero GmbH held by Tim Heidfeld during the period 
2010 to 2012 in pre-determined tranches. The consideration to be paid by Moneysupermarket.com Financial Group Limited for the 
acquisition of the shares in Icero GmbH held by Tim Heidfeld will be determined by the ﬁnancial performance of Icero GmbH during 
the ﬁnancial years 2009 to 2011. No liability has been recognised at the balance sheet date, as the consideration to be paid cannot 
be reliably measured. The contingent consideration will be recognised when payment becomes probable. According to the 
shareholder’s agreement, the maximum consideration that can be paid by Moneysupermarket.com Financial Group Limited to  
Tim Heidfeld for the acquisition of his 10% shareholding in Icero GmbH is €12,500,000. For the achievement by Icero GmbH of 
ﬁnancial performance less than the target ﬁnancial performance, the consideration payable by Moneysupermarket.com  
Financial Group Limited to Tim Heidfeld for the acquisition of the shares held by him in Icero GmbH is determined  
by a formula set out in the shareholder’s agreement.

(forming part of the ﬁnancial information)
1 Accounting policies
Basis of preparation
The Company was incorporated and registered in England and Wales on 14 March 2007 as a private company limited by shares
with the name Precis (2682) Limited. On 18 June 2007, the shareholders of the Company resolved to change the name of the 
Company to Moneysupermarket.com Group Limited. On 22 June 2007, the Company became the holding company of the 
Moneysupermarket.com group when it acquired the entire issued share capital of Moneysupermarket.com Financial Group
Limited and its subsidiaries. On 25 June 2007, the change of name of the Company became effective. On 9 July 2007, the Company 
resolved to re-register as a public limited company. On 9 July 2007, the re-registration of the Company as a public limited company 
became effective. Admission to the Ofﬁcial List and to trading on the London Stock Exchange took place on 31 July 2007. The 
Company has produced its accounts for the period to 31 December 2007. The ﬁnancial statements are prepared under the historical 
cost convention and in accordance with applicable United Kingdom accounting standards.
No proﬁt and loss account is presented for the Company as permitted by section 230 of the Companies Act 1985. The proﬁt after tax 
for the Company was £31,767,000.
The Company has taken the exemption in FRS1 5(a) and consequently no cash ﬂow statement is presented for the Company.
Investments
Investments are shown at cost less provision for impairment.
Share-based payment transactions
The share option programme allows certain employees of the Group to acquire shares in the Company. The fair value of options 
granted is recognised as an employee expense with a corresponding increase in equity. The fair value is measured at grant date and 
spread over the period during which the employees become unconditionally entitled to the options. The fair value of the options 
granted is measured using an option valuation model, taking into account the terms and conditions upon which the options  
were granted. The amount recognised as an expense is adjusted to reﬂect the actual number of share options that vest except 
where forfeiture is due only to share prices not achieving the threshold for vesting. Subsidiaries are recharged for the amount 
recognised as share based payments relating to awards for their employees. The fair value of the recharge is recognised over  
the vesting period.
Dividends
Dividends receivable are recognised when the Company’s right to receive payment is established. Dividends payable to the 
Company’s shareholders are recognised as a liability and deducted from shareholders’ equity in the period in which the 
shareholders’ right to receive payment is established.
Taxation
Tax on the proﬁt or loss for the period comprises current and deferred tax. Tax is recognised in the Income Statement except  
to the extent that it relates to items recognised directly in equity, in which case it is recognised in equity.
Current tax is the expected tax payable on the taxable income for the period, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted  
at the balance sheet date, and any adjustment to tax payable in respect of previous years.
Deferred tax is recognised, without discounting, in respect of all timing differences between the treatment of certain items for 
taxation and accounting purposes which have arisen but not reversed by the balance sheet date, except as otherwise required  
by FRS 19. 
2 Share-based payments
The analysis and disclosures in relation to share-based payments are given in the consolidated Group ﬁnancial statements in

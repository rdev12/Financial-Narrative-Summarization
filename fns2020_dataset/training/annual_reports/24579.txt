20% increase in revenue:
Revenue increased by 20% to £159.0 million, being driven by an increase of £24.7 million from the Vantage
division. Vantage revenue has beneﬁted from improved revenue margins on funds, increased assets under
administration and a full year’s revenue on assets secured in the previous year, all of which have more than
oﬀset the fall in revenue margin on cash.  The proportion of recurring revenue i.e. management fees, renewal
commission and interest, remained high at 72% (2009: 70%).  
(*) Adjusted proﬁt excludes one-oﬀ costs relating to the new oﬃce, as detailed in the Financial Review. 
Adjusted operating proﬁt margin of 56.5%: 
Costs have been well controlled during the year.  The Group’s adjusted operating margin has increased by
2.9% to 56.5%.  The increase resulted from 20% revenue growth coupled with an increase to operating costs
of 12%.
£17.5 billion total assets under administration:
The 47% growth in asset values is attributable to strong new business volumes combined with a signiﬁcant
market increase. There was a 17% increase in the FTSE All-Share index during the year.

BACK TO CONTENTS
Hargreaves Lansdown is in business to help investors make more of their money by providing a
combination of the best information, the best service and the best prices in its areas of operation, thereby
creating value for clients, staﬀ and shareholders. Chairman’s Statement
Annual report and financial statements | Year ended 30 June 2010 5
BACK TO CONTENTS
“Our staﬀ remain our most
important asset and everything
we do would not be possible
without their hard work and
commitment.”
The Board is proposing a ﬁnal
ordinary dividend of 0.58 pence
(2009: 4.229p) and a special
dividend of 1.7 pence (2009:
2.807p)
Total dividends have 
increased by 18%
2010: 11.88 pence
2009: 10.101 pence
Profit before tax increased by 18% from
£73.1 million to £86.3 million, and turnover
increased by 20% from £132.8 million to
£159.0 million.  Our percentage of revenue
which is recurring in nature (i.e. renewal
income, management fees and interest) rose
slightly to 72% compared to 70% for the
previous year, driven by the significant
increase in assets under administration
which in turn has driven renewal income
and management fees. 
Operating costs continue to be well
controlled allowing our adjusted operating
profit margin to increase from 53.6% to
56.5%.  Adjusted diluted earnings per share
have risen by 23% to 13.9 pence compared
to 11.3 pence for 2009.
During the year our assets under
administration increased from £11.9 billion
to £17.5 billion.  This includes £1.8 billion
of assets under our own management.  Total
assets under administration increased by
47% compared to an increase in the FTSE
All-Share index of 17%.
Dividend
The performance of the Group has allowed
us to propose a final ordinary dividend of
0.58 pence per share increasing the total
ordinary dividends up to 8.58 pence per
share for the year.  This total dividend
payout equates to 65% of post tax profits.  
As in previous periods we have reviewed our
cash requirements going forward and are
pleased to propose a special dividend of 1.70
pence per share.  This equates to a further
25% of post tax profits when the special
interim dividend of 1.6 pence per share is
added and this takes the total dividend
payout for the year to 11.88 pence per share.
We remind shareholders that any special
dividend in future years will depend upon
our future cash requirements and therefore
may vary.
Staﬀ
Hargreaves Lansdown is in business to help
clients make more of their money by
providing the best information, the best
service and the best prices.  We have
continued to attract new clients and retain
existing clients. Our staff remain our most
important asset and everything we do would
not be possible without their hard work and
commitment.
Oﬃces
On 15 February 2010, we successfully
moved into our new offices, One College
Square South, Bristol; the culmination of
many months of hard work by a number of
our staff. The new working environment is of
a high quality, befitting of one of the larger
employers in the city.
Board changes
Over the course of the year there has been a
lot of focus on ensuring an orderly process of
senior management succession as the
Company enters the next stage of its
development.  As a result, a number of
changes have now been made to the
membership of the Board.
As had previously been announced, Stephen
Lansdown stepped down as Chairman on 1
December 2009 and it was a great honour
for me to become non-executive Chairman
the same day.  Having overseen the
successful office move, Stephen focused on
providing support and challenge to all parts
of the business before taking a sabbatical in
the summer months.  The Board has agreed
with Stephen that the most appropriate way
to provide ongoing challenge and support is
as a non-executive director.  Therefore on 26
August 2010 he stepped down as an
executive director and was appointed as a
non-executive director (although due to his
previous executive role we accept that we
cannot deem him to be independent).
Ian Gorham joined the business in
September 2009 as Chief Operating Officer.
He very quickly demonstrated his
capabilities and we recognised his potential
to be a future leader of the business.  Peter
Hargreaves had indicated his desire to step
down as Chief Executive at the appropriate
time, but remain heavily involved in the
business.  Therefore on 26 August 2010, we
were delighted to confirm the appointment
of Ian Gorham as an executive director, a few
days before taking on the position of Chief
Executive. 
I am pleased to report that the Group has had another successful year which is very satisfying in view of
the economic uncertainty both in the UK and indeed globally. Chairman’s Statement
Annual report and financial statements | Year ended 30 June 2010 6
BACK TO CONTENTS
Earlier in the year, to bring more balance to
the Board, the Nominations Committee
decided to appoint a further non-executive
director.  Rather than engage a firm of
headhunters, it was decided that we would
advertise the position to a subset of our
clients. An initial mailing of some 8,000
clients resulted in approximately 150 high
quality applications. Following the selection
criteria laid down by the Nominations
Committee, and after two rounds of
interviews, we were delighted to appoint
Chris Barling to the Board on 26 August
2010. Chris is currently CEO of Actinic, a
privately owned software company. We
believe Chris’ extensive IT experience will
bring greater breadth of skills to the Board.
These appointments mean we now have a
Board of eight directors, of whom three are
executives, four are non-executives, and
myself as non-executive Chairman. We
believe it is a strong board to support the
new Chief Executive, and importantly retains
the ongoing input of the two founders who
remain the largest shareholders in the
Company.
Peter Hargreaves and Stephen Lansdown
founded this great company way back in
1981 and have personally overseen its
development into a highly profitable, client
oriented, public listed company. I would like
to thank them both for their enormous
contribution to the Company and am
delighted that they will continue to provide
guidance to the Company in their respective
new roles. 
During the year, Simon Power decided to
step down as Company Secretary to focus on
his role within the Finance team. I would like
to thank Simon for his valued work during
his time as Company Secretary. On 30 March
2010, we were delighted to appoint Judy
Matthews as the new Company Secretary.
Regulation
The final details of the Retail Distribution
Review should be issued by the Financial
Services Authority in the autumn of this year,
following a consultation paper issued in
March 2010 which focused specifically on
platforms such as our Vantage service. This
contained some proposals that may
necessitate significant change for our
industry.  We have sought to make our views
known through this consultation process and
await the final outcome with interest. We
believe our business has little to fear from
sensible regulatory change and indeed is well
placed to take advantage of the more
transparent and competitive market
conditions that the RDR is intended to
introduce. We will continue however to be
vigilant in monitoring the impact of the new
proposed regime for platforms as more details
emerge.  The new Coalition Government has
announced changes to the Financial Services
Authority and this will have an impact on
how we are regulated in the future and we
need to watch this very carefully.
Conclusion
Peter Hargreaves in his Chief Executive report
has highlighted the performance of the Group
and the outlook for the future.  The Board of
directors, together with the Executive
Committee, has operated efficiently and
diligently during the year and I would like to
thank all my fellow directors for their
contribution.  Our trading performance
demonstrates the resilience of our business
model.  The continued development of our
Board, Executive Committee and subsidiary
Boards illustrates the strength and depth of
the management team and the robustness of
our corporate governance.

Chairman
8 September 2010 Chief Executive’s Statement  
Annual report and financial statements | Year ended 30 June 2010 7
BACK TO CONTENTS
Turning the clock back twelve months we
entered this year under review with more
trepidation than for many years.  The
government were doing the only thing they
knew; trying to spend us out of our
problems.  Interest rates were historically
low and the recession was a constant worry.
The stock market was 33% lower (FTSE All-
Share) than it had been at the turn of the
millennium, and doom and gloom
abounded. 
The only glimmer of light at the end of a very
long tunnel was that low interest rates were
driving investors to examine other forms of
income producing assets.  We were also
seeing increasing interest in our services and
for that we would thank our existing clients
who willingly extolled the virtues of our
service supplementing the efforts of my
excellent marketing team.
There have been two significant highlights
during the year.  The first has been the
unprecedented amount of new business.  In
almost every part of the firm we have seen
substantial increases in volumes.  Indeed
during the year we did top one million
stockbroking deals.  
The other area which was encouraging was
the buoyancy of stock markets, which saw
the FTSE All-Share index rise to a high of
2989.13 in April 2010 from just 2172.08 on
1 July 2009 (the beginning of our accounting
period).  The level of the market is critical for
our earnings.
Outlook and strategy
It is always difficult to forecast the coming
year when the time I write this statement is
during the summer months which
historically are always quieter. This year is
no exception. There are however many
things that encourage us for the coming year.
First of all our new Corporate Vantage
proposition is being very well received in its
marketplace.  This enables us to put another
piece in our jigsaw puzzle ensuring that all
our earnings are on a similar basis.
Elsewhere we have restructured our
Financial Practitioners division which
means we are probably ahead of the game in
preparation for the Retail Distribution
Review which seems to be paralysing most of
the rest of the financial services industry.
Most encouraging of all is the number of new
clients who find their way to our door, or
rather more precisely to our website.  The
increase in the UK’s savings ratio is a cause
for optimism.  Whilst this ratio has been
mainly affected by people paying down debt,
eventually some of those increased savings
are likely to end up with us.  
A year ago I warned that the year ending
June 2010 would see a substantial reduction
of income as a result of the low interest rate
environment.  That situation has not
changed but in the forthcoming year we will
be comparing those earnings with a similar
low potential year of earnings due to the
likely continuation of low interest rates.
I could not review this year without
mentioning our new office.  I must applaud
our IT team and all the other members of
staff who worked to make the office move so
painless.  We are very proud of our new
office.  It is wonderful that once more I have
the opportunity to see all the staff every day
and being under one roof we have already
generated new ideas as well as savings and
believe there are many more that we shall
establish over the year.
Summary
I suspect the problems that we can foresee at
the moment are less critical than the ones we
envisaged a year ago.  At that time we faced a
significant loss of income through lower
interest rates, and the office move was in
front of us.  Today we are completely settled
in our new home and we have found
recruitment not only easier than ever before
but the quality of our recruits is excellent.
We also  have the advantage of significantly
higher assets under administration on which
we earn most of our income, although as a
significant portion of our earnings are based
on the value of our clients’ investments at
the end of each month our results going
forward will be affected by market
performance.
My new role
I shall be stepping down as Chief Executive
on 2 September 2010 and I am delighted to
hand on that role to the very safe pair of
hands of Ian Gorham.  It is also gratifying to
know that right throughout the firm every
senior position is covered by at least one
very able understudy. 
I have enjoyed being Chief Executive of
Hargreaves Lansdown over the years.  The
business is my life’s work and the only thing
I can do now is to assure both clients and
investors that I have not handed on this
position lightly.  Ian Gorham is I believe the
right man for this job.  Indeed the business
has changed so much that it now needs
different skills, ones that Ian possesses in
abundance. I must thank everyone in the
firm who has worked with me over the years
and helped me make Hargreaves Lansdown
the successful and prosperous business it is
today.
I shall remain as a Director of Hargreaves
Lansdown, although I will be reducing my
workload to 3 to 4 days a week.  My passion
has always been in ensuring client literature
and marketing initiatives are the best they
could possibly be; therefore my focus will be
on providing challenge to ensure we keep
the highest possible standards in these
important areas.

BACK TO CONTENTS
This OFR has been prepared to provide
additional information to shareholders to
assess the current position and future
potential of the Group. It should not be
relied on by any other party for any other
purpose.  This OFR contains forward-looking
statements that involve risks and
uncertainties. The Group’s actual results may
differ materially from the results discussed
in the forward-looking statements as a result
of various economic factors or the business
risks, some of which are set out in this
document.
Long term strategy and key objectives
Hargreaves Lansdown is a leading provider
of investment management products and
services to private investors in the UK.  
Our flagship service, Vantage, is a direct-to-
private investor fund and wrap platform.
Vantage offers clients the administrative
convenience of being able to hold and
manage their investments, including unit
trusts, OEICs, equities, ETFs, bonds,
investment trusts and cash, irrespective of
the tax vehicle, in one place with
consolidated valuation reports, a single
dealing service and instant online access.
In addition to offering externally managed
investment products, we manage funds
through our own range of multi-manager
funds and PMS, our discretionary portfolio
management service.  We also provide
independent financial advisory and
stockbroking services to private investors
and advisory services to companies in
respect of group pension schemes.
In providing this breadth of services direct to
the private investor, we offer a compelling
proposition for clients. 
Fund supermarkets and wrap platforms
typically focus on servicing the IFA
community and are remunerated for acting
as administrator. The IFA using the platform
is remunerated for acting as distributor. We
provide our fund supermarket and wrap
platform direct to the private investor,
thereby performing the role, and capturing
the economics, of both the platform provider
and distributor.
We strengthen our ability to win and retain
clients by discounting initial charges and
passing on a portion of the annual
management charge to clients as a loyalty
bonus on many Vantage accounts.  The
Hargreaves Lansdown business model
allows us to offer highly competitive prices
to our clients and achieve strong
profitability.
We aim to create shareholder value by being
the leading provider of investment
management products and services to
private investors in the UK. 
Our strategy is focused on growing the value
of assets we have under administration or
management and consequently increasing
our revenues, maintaining tight cost control
and improving our profit margin. In
particular, we will focus on: 
Administration
• providing high quality information and
services to our clients 
• continuous improvements to our
platform and infrastructure
• giving clients the confidence and support
to transact business online
• motivating and retaining our talented
employees 
• maintaining our client-focused and
entrepreneurial culture
• cost control and operational efficiency
Marketing
• maintaining our dialogue with clients
• expanding our investor database
• improving our range of services
• remaining flexible, responsive and
opportunistic
• maintaining and improving our profile
• continual improvement of data capture
and data mining
Competition and markets
The markets in which Hargreaves Lansdown
operates are highly fragmented. We compete
with other businesses providing investment
products and services direct to the private
investor. These include IFAs, execution-only
brokers, banks, building societies, life
assurers and those fund supermarkets and
wrap platforms which are available direct to
the private investor. We believe that Vantage
is the largest direct-to-private investor fund
supermarket and wrap platform in the UK.
Our target market is the UK mass affluent
population looking to invest their savings. 
This Operating and Financial Review (‘OFR’) describes the main trends and factors underlying our
performance and position during the year ended 30 June 2010 as well as those which are likely to aﬀect us
in the future. This OFR has been prepared with consideration to the guidance provided in the UK Accounting

A key indicator of success for the Group is the extent to which it has
increased its total assets under administration (AUA) during the
period.  This involves encouraging existing clients to entrust us with
more of their savings through the provision of quality service,
information and pricing, whilst also attracting new clients through
our various marketing initiatives.  
In 2010 the value of total assets under administration grew by 47%
from £11.9 billion to £17.5 billion. This is primarily made up of
£16.3 billion (2009: £10.9 billion) of assets held within the Vantage
service, with the remainder being assets held within the Portfolio
Management Service.  The 47% (2009: 7%) growth in asset values
was attributable to strong new business volumes, combined with a
significant market increase. During the 2010 financial year, the FTSE
All-Share index rose by 17% (2009: fell by 24%) and has on average
been 17% higher (2009: 28% lower) than during the previous year. 
The Vantage service allows clients to hold assets in tax efficient
wrappers such as an ISA or SIPP , or alternatively in a Fund and Share
Account.  The highest growth in asset values during the year was
evident in the SIPP , increasing by 58%.  
As at 30 June 2010, the value of the Vantage ISA was £6.9 billion,
(30 June 2009: £4.7 billion), the Vantage SIPP was £4.6 billion (30
June 2009: £2.9 billion) and the Vantage Fund and Share Account
was £4.8 billion (30 June 2009: £3.2 billion).     Operating and Financial Review
Annual report and financial statements | Year ended 30 June 2010 10
BACK TO CONTENTS
The £5.4 billion (2009: £0.7 billion) increase
in Vantage assets from £10.9 billion to £16.3
billion can be attributed to £3.2 billion of net
new business inflows (2009: £1.8 billion),
other positive growth factors with a value of
£0.2 billion (2009: £0.1 billion), such as
retained investment income and £2.0 billion
of stock market increase (net of interest
credited to clients on cash balances) compared
to £1.2 billion of market decline in 2009. 
Vantage clients decreased their cash
weightings during the period as worldwide
stock markets began to recover and their
appetite to invest in equities and funds
returned.  The composition of assets across
the whole of Vantage changed during the
period. As at 30 June 2010, Vantage assets
were held 28% as equities (30 June 2009:
26%), 60% as funds (30 June 2009: 58%)
and 12% as cash (30 June 2009: 16%). 
The value of assets managed by Hargreaves
Lansdown through its own range of multi-
manager funds and PMS increased by  £0.4
billion to £1.8 billion as at 30 June 2010
(2009: £1.4 billion). Of these assets under
management, £0.6 billion were held within
Vantage as at 30 June 2010 (2009: £0.4
billion).  The growth in assets is due to a positive
market growth of £0.2 billion combined with
net new business of £0.2 billion.
Analysis of our assets under administration
suggests that the FTSE All-Share index is the
most appropriate benchmark to use for the
market and so any change in this index can
form a useful comparison against the growth
in AUA.  The FTSE All-Share index rose by
17% during the year ended 30 June 2010,
from 2172.08 to 2543.47, reversing much of
the 24% fall in the prior year.  On average the
FTSE All-Share index has been 17% higher than
during the 2009 financial year. The positive
effect of the market during the year combined
with the record year for net new business has
driven the 47% growth to total AUA. 
The importance of AUA is that they produce a
recurring revenue stream made up of renewal
commission, management fees and interest.
The percentage of recurring revenue
attributable to these ‘quality earnings’
increased from 70% in 2009 to 72% in 2010.
The value of recurring revenues increased by
22% from £93.2 million to £113.8 million.  
Not all of our AUA generate recurring
revenue. For example, there are no annual
charges levied on equities held in the Vantage
Fund and Share Account.  For these assets the
Group receives dealing commission based
upon the levels of trading activity.  So when
looking at the growth in total AUA, it is
relevant to consider another indicator; the
proportion of assets earning recurring
revenue. This has remained the same as in
2009 at 86%. This can largely be attributed to
the substantial volume of Hargreaves
Lansdown shares in the Fund and Share
account which, like all equities in this
account, do not generate any recurring
revenue.  The price of Hargreaves Lansdown
shares ended the year 65% higher, with a
value of £1.1 billion on the platform
compared to an opening value of £0.7 billion.
The indicators mentioned above provide a
useful measure of how successful the Group
has been in gathering assets under
administration. However, it does not give
any indication of whether this success is
predominantly due to effective cross selling
to existing clients and their increasing
wealth or whether the Group is successfully
adding to its client bank. This is essential in
order to replace natural client losses and
expand the business.  The number of active
Vantage clients acts as an indicator of how
successful the Group has been in this
respect. In 2010, the number has increased
by 17% (2009: 13%) and as at 30 June 2010
stood at 330,000.  
The operating profit margin is another key
financial indicator, increasing from 52.5% to
53.7%. Alternatively using the adjusted
operating profit margin, where we exclude
any investment gains and one-off costs
relating to the new offices, the increase is
from 53.6% to 56.5%. The chart depicts how
the operating margin has grown significantly
year-on-year since 2006.  
The Group’s revenue, predominantly derived
from asset values, has been able to grow
quicker than costs. The efficiency of the
Vantage platform is central to the scalability
of the business model.
We consider the adjusted diluted earnings
per share figure, adjusted to exclude the impact
of investment gains and the one-off costs of
the new office, to be the most appropriate
measure of performance.  This increased by
23% in the year from 11.3 pence to 13.9
pence.

BACK TO CONTENTS
It has been a record year for the Group in terms
of revenue, profits, client recruitment and new
business volumes.  A rise in stock markets
during the year has helped to increase assets
under administration (AUA) and the revenue
derived from them, but the more significant
contribution has come from record levels of
organic growth in the form of new business and
new clients. At the same time the economic
environment has been a difficult one and the
historically low interest rates seen throughout
the year have caused a significant headwind.
As a result the revenue derived from client
cash has been reduced by £10.6 million this
year but this was more than offset by the
increase to revenue from market growth and
net new business.  Overall, the Group has
increased revenue by £26.2 million or 20%.  
The Group’s adjusted operating profit increased
by 26% to £89.8 million in 2010 compared
to £71.2 million for 2009.  The Group’s
adjusted operating profit margin increased
from 53.6% to 56.5%.  The increase resulted
from 20% revenue growth, coupled with
tight cost management resulting in an
increase to administration expenses of just
12%. 
There were £0.9 million of investment
revenue and other gains during the year
compared to £3.3 million in the year ended
30 June 2009. The lower value in the current
year is predominantly due to interest
revenues received on the Group’s own cash
balances being £1.6 million lower as a result
of the lower interest rate environment; the
prior year also included an additional 
deferred consideration on the disposal of a 
fixed asset investment during an earlier year,
which resulted in net gains of £0.7 million.
The Group’s reported profit before tax
increased to £86.3 million, compared to
£73.1 million in the previous year.  The
effective tax rate for the Group this year was
28.9% which has resulted in a reported
profit after tax for the year of £61.3 million,
compared to £52.1 million for the previous
year.
Revenue 
During the 2010 financial year the
predominant factor affecting revenue has
been the significant difference between
interest rates prevailing during the year and
the rates achieved during the previous
financial year. This single factor has created
a significant headwind on the current year’s
profitability in comparison to the previous
year. Whilst interest rates remain low this
will have a continuing effect on profitability.

£’million £’million
Vantage 112.2 87.5
Discretionary 22.9 19.3
Third Party and
other services 23.9 26.0
159.0 132.8
The Group is organised into three core
operating divisions, based around products
and services.
The Vantage division increased its revenues
by £24.7 million, from £87.5 million to
£112.2 million. This resulted from growth in
assets under administration from £10.9
billion to £16.3 billion, the impact of a full
year’s income on assets acquired during the
previous year offset by lower revenue
margins. The overall average monthly
revenue margin within Vantage decreased
from 92bps per annum in 2009 to 78bps per
annum in 2010, as a result of the lower
interest rates.  
In last year’s annual report we highlighted
how the divergence between the base rate
and LIBOR had created increased interest
returns on cash and how this began
unwinding in the second half of last year.
This unwinding continued into the 2010
financial year and has caused reduced
margins on cash balances such that interest
revenue of £20.5 million in 2010 was 34%
down on the prior year value of £31.1
million.  
The Discretionary division earns recurring
income on underlying investments held in
PMS, and on investments in the Group’s
multi-manager funds. Revenues in the
Discretionary division increased by 19% from
£19.3 million to £22.9 million. Increased
renewal commissions and management fees
resulting from the increase in AUA were the
key drivers. The value of Hargreaves
Lansdown’s multi-manager funds increased
from £1.3 billion to £1.7 billion between 30
June 2009 and 30 June 2010. As at 30 June
2010, 66% of these were held within PMS,
33% were held within Vantage and the
remainder were held directly. 
This division also earns initial charges and
management fees on assets introduced into
the Group’s Portfolio Management Service
(PMS). The value of assets managed in PMS
increased by 27% from £982m to £1,249m.
This growth was driven by £99m of net new
business and £168m of market growth. The
sole distribution of PMS is through the Group’s
team of advisors. The number of advisors
decreased from 75 at the start of the year to 62
by 30 June 2010, including 6 advisors
allocated to the division’s telephone service.
The proportion of PMS assets invested in
Hargreaves Lansdown multi-manager funds
increased from 89% to 91% during the year.
The multi-manager funds maintained
exposure to equities and corporate bonds
during the year and the markets had a positive
effect on the assets under management.
Throughout the year the Group operated five
multi-manager funds and four of them have
outperformed their IMA sector average during
the financial year. Taking a longer time
horizon of five years, all three of the funds that
have been in existence that long, have also
outperformed their IMA sector average.
Hargreaves Lansdown’s Third Party and
other services division comprises those
investment products which are distributed by
the Group but not held in Vantage accounts.
These include corporate pensions, personal
pensions, annuities, third party investment
products and venture capital trusts. In
addition this division includes the stockbroking
services we provide, namely certificated share
dealing, CFD’s, spread betting and currency
service. The division as a whole saw a fall in
revenues of 8%, from £26.0 million to £23.9
million. Of the £2.1 million decrease, £1.6
million can be attributed to a decrease in
revenue from corporate pensions and £0.6
million to a decrease in revenue from personal
pensions. Revenue from the previous year was
boosted by particularly strong volumes of
annuity sales and higher levels of income from
the implementation of new corporate pension
schemes. This combined with the fact that
more clients are choosing to transfer their
pension assets onto the Vantage platform has
caused this decline. The transferring of assets
across to the Vantage platform is a trend
expected to continue. Although individual
annuity sales dropped, corporate annuity
income grew by £0.3 million. Successful
marketing and ease of execution through our
website have helped drive this increase in
completed annuities. 
The division continues to focus its marketing
efforts to raise awareness of the Hargreaves
Lansdown Corporate Vantage service. Over
time, management expects a transition in Operating and Financial Review

corporate pensions away from the traditional
initial commission model to a Group SIPP
recurring revenue based model through the
Corporate Vantage service.  This is very much
in line with the Group’s focus on maximising
‘quality’ recurring revenues. 
Revenue from the Third Party Investments
business increased by £0.5 million due to
increased renewal commission on the
increased asset values. This more than offset
the trend of clients choosing to transfer their
investments onto the Vantage platform, a
trend that increases the long term quality of
earnings but reduces income classified as
third party. 
Revenue from Other Services, which include
CFDs, spread betting, currency services and
certificated dealing, declined by £0.3 million
due primarily to lower spread betting revenues.  
Across the Group, record stockbroking
volumes have been transacted in terms of
equity and fund deals both of which are up
year on year by 44% and 58% respectively.
The revenue from these deals is primarily
accounted for in the Vantage division.
Currency and spread betting trades are also
up year on year whilst certificated deal and
CFD trades are lower.

Administrative expenses before one-off costs
have increased by 12% from £61.6 million to
£69.2 million. The above expenses exclude
the one-off administrative expenses relating
to the Group’s relocation to its new office in
February 2010.
Taken in the context of a 20% increase in
revenue and a 26% increase in adjusted
operating profit year on year, the 12%
increase in administrative expenses shows
that we have maintained a strong focus on
cost control and efficiencies and also
demonstrates the scalability of our business
model.  
The Group’s largest cost remains staff costs,
which represents 52% of administrative
expenses (2009: 60%) and which as a
percentage of administrative expenses
decreased by 8%. The number of staff
(including directors) employed at 30 June
2010 was 644, and the average number of
staff during the year was 628, an increase of
3% against an average of 607 for the
comparative year.   The increase in staff
numbers results mainly from an increase in
the volume of business transacted during the
year and was most marked in the months
surrounding the tax year-end. 
Commission payable includes the share of
renewal commission which the Group
receives on funds held in Vantage which is
rebated back to clients as a cash loyalty
bonus (except with respect to those funds
held in the SIPP). It increased by 42%, from
£8.3 million to £11.8 million, in line with
the rise in value of the related client assets. 
Group marketing spend increased by 37%,
from £6.0 million to £8.2 million. This
includes the costs of sending information to
existing and potential clients, including the
Group’s flagship publication, the Investment
Times. These costs also include an element of
media advertising, postage, stationery and
the cost of corresponding with clients. There
has been an overall increase in the level of
client communication and direct marketing
activity in the year compared to the previous
financial year.  Whilst increasing the level of
overall communication, we have maintained
a focus on trying to increase the proportion of
client marketing taking place online or via
email, in order to minimise costs. The use of
the internet is also helping to both improve
service and save costs as clients opt out of
receiving paper valuations and contract notes
and instead receive them in electronic format
through our secure website.  As at 30 June
2010, 33% had opted to receive such
documents electronically.  
The capital expenditure of the business
increased significantly in the year due to the
completion of the new office for business use.
Accordingly, the charge for depreciation,
amortisation and financial costs for the year
increased from £1.9 million to £2.7 million.
The increase is predominantly an increase in
depreciation arising from fixtures and fittings
and additional computer equipment at the
new office location.  
Other administrative costs and overheads
include items such as building and utility
costs, dealing costs, irrecoverable VAT,
compliance costs, insurance, professional
services, computer maintenance and external
administration charges.  These increased by
28% from £8.2 million to £10.5 million.
Some of these costs increased due to higher
business volumes, large step increases relate
to the rent and rates associated with the new
office.
Non operating income
Investment revenues decreased from £3.3
million to £0.9 million. The fall was due to a
£1.6m reduction from interest on the Group’s
cash balances due to the fall in interest rates
and the fact that last year included an
investment disposal gain of £0.7 million. 
Taxation
Taxation increased from £21.0 million to
£25.0 million. The higher charge can be
attributed to an increase in pre-tax profits,
whilst the effective tax rate has increased to
around 28.9%, which is above the standard
rate of taxation of 28% due to the
disallowable costs incurred in connection
with the new office. 
Earnings per share (EPS)
The basic diluted EPS increased by 18% from
11.1 pence to 13.1 pence. Adjusted diluted
EPS increased by 23%, from 11.3 pence to
13.9 pence. This is calculated as the earnings
for the year, adjusted to exclude the net effect
of investment gains and excluding one-off
costs relating to the new office, divided by the
total weighted average fully diluted number of
shares, including those held by the Employee
Benefit Trust (the “EBT”).  As at 30 June
2010, the EBT held sufficient shares to satisfy
all outstanding share options granted under
the Employee Share Schemes.  
Dividend
The directors are now recommending a final
ordinary dividend of 0.58 pence per ordinary
share and a special dividend of 1.70 pence
per ordinary share, payable on 29 September
2010 to all shareholders on the register at the
close of business on 10 September 2010.
When added to the ordinary interim dividend
of 8.0 pence per share and the special interim
dividend per share of 1.6 pence per share,
this brings the total dividends in respect of Operating and Financial Review
Annual report and financial statements | Year ended 30 June 2010 13
BACK TO CONTENTS
the year to 11.88 pence per ordinary share
(2009: 10.101p). Further information on the
interim dividend is given overleaf.
An arrangement exists under which the
Hargreaves Lansdown EBT has agreed to
waive all dividends.
Cash ﬂow and capital expenditure
Capital expenditure increased significantly
from £1.6 million to £8.1 million, the
majority of which related to the new office
and therefore does not represent a normal
ongoing level of capital expenditure. 
The Group is highly cash generative with the
only significant outgoing from underlying
profits during the current year being the
payment of a dividend. 
The total cash balance of £71.2 million
reported in the balance sheet includes £9.7
million of client settlement account balances.
The Group’s own cash balances decreased
from £77.2 million to £61.5 million during
the year. This includes cash held within the
EBT which has decreased from £6.8 million
as at 30 June 2009 to £3.3 million at 30 June
2010 following the purchase of additional
Hargreaves Lansdown plc shares during the
year.  The decrease in cash was also caused by
the high dividend payments made in the year
which included last year’s declared final
dividend of £32.7m (2009: £22.0 million)
plus this year’s higher than usual level of
interim dividend of £44.6 million (2009:
£14.2 million).  Given that a large proportion
of shares in the Company are held by private
individuals, the Board resolved that it was
appropriate to pay as much of an interim
dividend as possible prior to the end of the
tax year ended 5 April 2010, in advance of the
10% increase to the top rate of tax for
individual taxpayers.
Net assets, capital requirement and
treasury policy 
Group net assets decreased from £84.6
million to £66.1 million. The decrease
includes the effect of the high dividend
payments made in the year. 
The Group has four subsidiary companies
which are authorised and regulated by the
Financial Services Authority. These firms
maintain capital resources at a level which
satisfies both their regulatory capital
requirements as well as their working capital
requirements. As at 30 June 2010, the
aggregated Pillar 1 regulatory capital
requirement across the four regulated
subsidiary companies was approximately
£7.5 million compared to capital resources of
approximately £49.3 million, which resulted
in a surplus of approximately £41.8 million.
The Group has no borrowings and deposits
its liquid funds with selected financial
institutions with high credit ratings. In
2010, the Group’s funds were held with no
fewer than three of these institutions and up
to as many as five. The Board reviews its
usage of banks on a regular basis with the
primary objective of ensuring the security of
its assets and the secondary objective of
maximising its return on them. The Group
actively maintains cash balances on short
term deposit to ensure that it has sufficient
available funds for operations. This policy is
designed to ensure that the Group takes no
material credit risk. 
The Group is not exposed to significant
foreign exchange translation or transaction
risk. 
Operations
IT
We continue to run the vast majority of our
administration and systems development in-
house rather than outsourcing to third
parties. In particular, we maintain full
control of the Vantage platform which is
fundamental in the administration of both
Vantage and the Portfolio Management
Service. The notable exception is the
administration of our multi-manager funds
which is currently outsourced.  We believe
that having control of our own platform
gives us the ability to control service levels
and react quickly to changing markets and
the needs of our clients. Those areas of our
business which are outsourced are kept
under close review to ensure they continue
to meet our standards.
We have a continuing programme of work to
further improve the performance and
resilience of our systems and infrastructure.
Recently this has dovetailed with a large
piece of work to consolidate the firm’s offices
to the single new office.  All of which have
been managed to increase efficiency,
improve security and reduce risk.  Indeed a
key focus has been placed on business
continuity. 
The continued development of the
Hargreaves Lansdown website (www.H-
L.co.uk) is a key part of our strategy and we
continue to see the benefits of higher
volumes of business being transacted online.
A new feature to the on line Vantage
platform is the introduction of cash
withdrawals from specific accounts.  
Regulation
In their reports, the Chairman and Chief
Executive highlighted changes to the
regulatory landscape, in particular the FSA ’s
Retail Distribution Review. We are confident
that our current business model is well
positioned for these changes. 
Staff
Our employees are vital to the Group’s
continuing success and we continue to focus
on motivating and retaining our talented
staff.      
During March 2010 we granted new options
under a SAYE scheme. Our Employee Benefit
Trust (EBT) is well funded and holds
sufficient shares to satisfy all outstanding
options. Further shares were purchased by
the EBT during the year to be used for the
future incentivisation of staff. The Board
believes that the use of share schemes in the
future will continue to incentivise staff and
help align their interests with those of other
shareholders.  Many employees also receive
an annual bonus related to the overall
profitability of the Group.
In addition to remunerating staff well, we aim
to retain and attract staff through the
provision of training, career progression,
good communication and a vibrant culture.
The continued growth and success of the
organisation continues to create
opportunities for staff. We believe that
moving all our staff into a single building has
improved communication even further and
will help ensure that we maintain the
dynamic culture that has been crucial to the
Group’s success.
Corporate social responsibility
The Board considers that the environmental
risk from direct actions taken by the Group is
minimal, and that the main social responsibility
focus should be on the Group’s staff and
customers.  Information on the Group’s
employment policies and client service is
detailed in the Directors’ Report.  However,
we appreciate that alongside providing our
clients with the best service and producing
profits for our shareholders, we can also take
sensible steps to reduce the impact of our
business on the environment. We continue to
shred and recycle confidential waste and have Operating and Financial Review
Annual report and financial statements | Year ended 30 June 2010 14
BACK TO CONTENTS
arrangements for the collection of recyclable
waste such as printer toner cartridges, cardboard,
newspapers and out-of-date literature.  We
also continue to recycle redundant IT
equipment through specialist third parties.  
In many respects, our objective of reducing
waste and minimising the environmental
impact of our business is aligned with our
objectives of protecting client data, reducing
costs, and improving efficiency. It is our aim
to deal with clients and other businesses
electronically wherever possible and we have
invested heavily in providing a user friendly,
comprehensive website and automated links
to banks and fund providers.  We provide the
facility for clients to opt out of receiving paper
valuations and contract notes. Instead these
documents are now available in electronic
format through our secure website. Our
investment in this area will continue and we
aim to further reduce the amount of paper we
use whilst providing better service.  The
benefits will grow as more people and
businesses choose to transact business and
receive information online.  
Business travel is another area which impacts
both our costs and the environment.  We do
not provide company cars as standard to
managers or to our network of advisors. These
advisors are spread throughout the UK which
minimises travel time. We provide a
telephone advice service to handle those
cases where a face-to-face meeting is
unnecessary. 
We appreciate that there is more we could do
to reduce the impact of our business on the
environment and we aim to improve on the
positive steps we have already taken and
ensure that social, environmental and ethical
considerations are taken into account in our
future decision making.  Our newly built
office has ‘chilled beam’ air conditioning,
which is up to 60% more energy efficient and
also utilises technology to manage lighting in
a manner which minimises wastage.  We will
continue to introduce energy-efficient
schemes and look at ways of optimising
building energy performance and reducing
our electricity usage.    
We provide an Ethical Investment Service to
assist clients who wish to invest in a socially
responsible manner. This includes an ethical
investment guide and a dedicated section of
our website with a tool which enables clients
to search for funds which meet their ethical
criteria.
The Group seeks to contribute to the
communities in which we live and work. In
addition to providing employment
opportunities and minimising our
environmental impact, we continue to
support a local community initiative. The
Board agreed in 2009 to provide support of
£30,000 p.a for five years to a project that,
like our own business, seeks to encourage
savings and financial awareness.  The
organisation provides these services in
deprived areas within Bristol. 
Every year we receive many requests for support
from a wide range of charitable and social
groups. Though often very worthy causes,
unfortunately we are not able to make a
donation to them all.  We have made it company
policy to support only one charity or non-profit
organisation each year which is selected from
suggestions received from employees within
the Group. This year we are again proud to
support Bristol’s Under Privileged Children’s
Charity, and our fund raising initiatives have
been focused on this charity.
Risks and uncertainties  
There are a number of potential risks to the
Group which could hinder the successful
implementation of our strategy and have a
material impact on our long term
performance. These arise from internal or
external events, acts or omissions which
could potentially pose a threat to the future
success and survival of the Group. The Board
and senior management of Hargreaves
Lansdown are proactive in identifying,
assessing and managing risk. 
The risk profile of the business has not
changed significantly this year, but a few of
the risks included in the 2009 Annual
Report have materialised, such as market
volatility. Although the markets remained
volatile in 2010, they did have a significant
upward trend. This was beneficial as a
significant part of Group revenue is based on
the value of client investments. Market
volatility remains a risk, although. the high
percentage of assets in tax wrappers and a
cash option on our platform does reduce the
impact of such market turbulence on our
performance. 
The continued low interest rate environment
creates a risk of a decline in earnings due to a
decline in interest turn. We have, however,
maintained good banking relationships and
due to the large value of cash deposits placed
we have managed to access competitive
interest rates and we have offered regular
fixed interest cash offers to our clients.
Turbulence remains in the banking sector
and hence we continue to include the risk of
bank default within the Group risk register,
alongside the more general risk of reliance
on third parties. Client money is currently
spread across a number of UK banks which
have strong credit ratings and our treasury
policy is regularly reviewed by management.
Our IT platform and infrastructure have
performed well throughout the year and we
have continued to invest and implement
changes with a strong focus on mitigating
the risks we face in this crucial area.  
The risk factors mentioned below do not
purport to be exhaustive as there may be
additional risks that the Group has not yet
identified or has deemed to be immaterial
that could have a material adverse effect on
the business. Operating and Financial Review

value of the Group’s assets under
administration or management, from which
we derive revenues.
• Focus on recurring revenue streams over the more volatile
transaction-based alternative.
• High proportion of assets under administration in tax wrappers
so clients less likely to withdraw funds and lose tax benefits.
• Cash option enables clients to shelter from market volatility.
Changing markets

• SAYE schemes in operation to incentivise staff and encourage
retention.  
Litigation or claims
made against the
Group
The Group’s business entails the risk of liability
related to litigation from clients or third parties
and actions taken by regulatory agencies.
There can be no assurance that a claim or
claims will be covered by insurance or, if
covered, will not exceed the limits of available
insurance coverage, or that any insurer will
remain solvent and will meet its obligations to
provide the Group with coverage. 
• High levels of Professional Indemnity Insurance cover. 
• Comprehensive internal review procedures for marketing
literature.
Reliance on third
parties 
Any regulatory breach or service failure on the
part of an outsourced service provider could
expose the Group to the risk of regulatory
sanctions and reputational damage.
• Due diligence forms part of the selection process for key
suppliers.
• Ongoing review by our internal audit team of key business
partners.
Strategic risk There is a risk that management will pursue
inappropriate strategies or implement the
Group’s strategy ineffectively.
• Very experienced management team, with a highly successful
track record to date.
• Management have demonstrated an excellent understanding of
the market and continue to monitor this effectively through
regular dialogue with clients.
Performance of  in-
house managed funds
If the investment performance of the
Hargreaves Lansdown multi-manager funds
were to be poor relative to the market or in
absolute terms, the Group would be
vulnerable to redemption / cancellation of
units by investors in those collective
investment funds and a consequential
reduction in revenues received from such
activities.
• Only manage Funds of Funds, divested equity management to
focus on core strength.
• Fund analysis focuses on ‘stock selection’ skills of manager
rather than basic performance analysis.
• Multi-manager funds well diversified at the underlying fund
level as well as by number of funds.
• Well established and proven investment process overseen by an
Internal Investment Committee. 
• Our Funds of Funds give investors exposure to a broad range of
underlying investments. They are therefore less vulnerable to
sector specific poor performance than specialised or focused funds.
Financial Risks
Risk Type Risk Mitigating Factors / Controls 
Liquidity risk The risk that the Group is unable to meet
liabilities as they become due because of an
inability to liquidate assets or obtain
adequate funding. 
• Highly cash generative business.
• Low working capital requirement.
• Group maintains a substantial surplus above regulatory and
working capital requirements.
• Treasury management policy provides for the availability of
liquid funds at short notice. 
Bank default Given the current economic climate and in
particular the unprecedented problems faced
by banks, there is a risk that a bank could
fail. 
• Only use banks with strong credit rating where we do not believe
the Government would allow them to fail.
• Deposits spread across several banks.
• Regular review and challenge of treasury policy by management.
Interest rate risks Risk of decline in earnings due to a decline in
interest turn.  Low interest rates make it
harder to attract client money.
• Good relationships with banks used.
• Access to competitive interest rates due to large value of cash
deposits placed.
• Regular fixed high interest cash offers available to clients. Operating and Financial Review

BACK TO CONTENTS
Outlook  
It is important to view these 2010 results in
the context of our overall growth over a
number of years, rather than as a comparison
to the exceptional results from the 2009
financial year.  The interest rate environment
contributed to a large increase in revenue in
2009, and so this year’s 20% growth to
revenue is all the more impressive given that
interest rates have remained at a record low
throughout the year.  Interest rates and
market volatility will continue to influence
our performance in the new financial year.
Our SIPP service continues to go from
strength to strength, as the pension and in
particular the SIPP market continues to
provide ample opportunities.  The continued
trend away from defined benefit to defined
contribution (DC) schemes means we expect
to see substantial growth in DC assets and for
the Group to benefit from that as a leading
SIPP provider. There may be a decline in new
SIPP contributions as a result of the
restriction of higher rate tax relief on pension
contributions for high earners, but many of
our SIPP clients are unaffected by these rules.
Overall, we do not expect to see SIPP inflows
reduce as a direct result of these rule changes
as the main source of SIPP inflows has always
been pension transfers which this year
accounted for roughly two-thirds of SIPP new
business.  We believe that investors will
continue to transfer their assets to us in order
to benefit from the services and information
we provide, together with the transparency,
choice and control available through our
platform. 
We still expect the provisions of the Financial
Services Authority’s Retail Distribution
Review (RDR) to only affect advisory business.
The Financial Services Authority’s current
proposals state that non-advised business
will be excluded from the RDR, and this
represents the majority of Hargreaves
Lansdown business.  In respect of the Group’s
advisory business, we have already
announced and successfully implemented a
remuneration structure for advisers that is
RDR compliant.  Other aspects of the RDR
such as increased qualifications our advisers
already comply with, or are easily
implemented. The Financial Services
Authority is due to publish a further
Consultation Paper on the regulation of
Platforms in the autumn. Any new Financial
Services Authority rules or changes in the
market as a whole following the
implementation of the RDR could impact us.
However, we believe we are very well placed
to accommodate any changes and maintain
our competitive position.
The Board has reviewed the Group’s progress
and strategy.  We remain focused on
providing an exceptional service, and on
growing the business principally through
growing assets under administration.
Opportunities include the increased ISA
allowance, new fund launches and corporate
wrap service. We will continue to invest in our
systems, equipment and infrastructure, as
well as maintaining high quality staff.   We
believe such an approach will ensure that we
continue to provide an excellent service,
ensure client satisfaction, help maintain
existing business and attract new business
and so will enhance long term value for
shareholders.  
During July 2010 we started providing our
new corporate wrap service, ‘Corporate
Vantage’, to the first client.  The level of
interest in the service and prospective pipeline
of corporate clients is very encouraging and
we look forward to welcoming new employers
on to the Corporate Vantage platform.
Although we do not anticipate any financial
benefit from this new service in the coming
financial year, we see the corporate market as
a significant and important source of new
assets and clients over the medium term.  
Current trading is satisfactory, but the
economic problems of the UK and the rest of
the world are not behind us and we expect
this to continue to influence our trading and
our clients’ ability to save. The Company is
extremely well placed to build on the
momentum that has been generated so far,
and our ability to innovate and remain
responsive to the economic environment will
assist us.

Annual report and financial statements | Year ended 30 June 2010 19
BACK TO CONTENTS
The directors present their annual report on the aﬀairs of the Group together with the ﬁnancial statements
and auditors’ report for the year ended 30 June 2010.
Principal Group activities
Hargreaves Lansdown plc is the parent
company of a group of companies which
offers a range of investment products,
investment services, financial planning and
advice.  Hargreaves Lansdown has
established a reputation for providing high
quality service and value-for-money
products to private investors, whether they
are making their own investment decisions
or looking for an advisory or discretionary
service. 
The Group's flagship service, Vantage, is a
direct-to-private investor fund and wrap
platform.  Vantage offers clients the
administrative convenience of being able to
hold and manage their investments,
including unit trusts, OEICs, equities, ETFs
bonds, investment trusts and cash,
irrespective of the tax vehicle, in one place
with consolidated valuation reports, a single
dealing service and instant online access.
The Group also provides independent
financial advisory and stockbroking services
to private investors and advisory services to
companies in respect of group pension
schemes. 
The subsidiary undertakings of the Group
during the year are listed in note 16 to the
financial statements.  The principal trading
subsidiaries, Hargreaves Lansdown Asset
Management Limited, Hargreaves Lansdown
Stockbrokers Limited, Hargreaves Lansdown
Fund Managers Limited and Hargreaves
Lansdown Pensions Direct Limited, are
authorised and regulated by the Financial
Services Authority.
Business review
A full review of the Group’s business
activities, financial position, cash flows,
liquidity position, together with the factors
likely to affect its future development,
performance and position are set out in the
Chairman’s and Chief Executive’s Statement
on pages 5 to 7 and the Operating and
Financial Review on pages 8 to 17 and are
incorporated into this report by reference.  In
addition, note 3 to the Financial Statements
discloses the key sources of estimation
uncertainty and judgements made by the
management; and note 28 includes the
Group’s policies and processes on capital
management, financial risk management
and details on its exposure to such risks.
The Group maintains ongoing forecasts that
indicate continued profitability in the 2011
financial year.  Stress test scenarios are
undertaken and the outcomes of which show
that the Group has adequate capital
resources for the foreseeable future even in
adverse economic conditions.  The Group’s
business is highly cash generative with a low
working capital requirement; indeed, the
forecast cash flows show that the Group will
remain highly liquid in the forthcoming
financial year.
The Directors therefore believe that the
Group is well placed to manage its business
risks successfully despite the current
uncertain economic outlook.  After making
enquiries, the Directors expectation is that
the Group will have adequate resources to
continue in business for the foreseeable
future.  Accordingly, they continue to adopt
the going concern basis in preparing the
Annual Report and Financial Statements.
Group results and Company dividends
Operating profit for the year ended 30 June
2010 was £85.4 million (2009: £69.8
million).  The Group profit after taxation for
the year ended 30 June 2010 was £61.3
million (2009: £52.1 million).  
Dividends are shown in note 11 to the
financial statements.  In addition to the first
interim dividend of 8.0 pence per share, we
have declared a second (final) ordinary
dividend of 0.58 pence per share, taking the
total ordinary dividends up to 8.58 pence
per share.  This total dividend payout
equates to 65% (2009: 65%) of post tax
profits. Our policy is not to accumulate
excess cash going forwards and we are
pleased to declare a special final dividend of
1.70 pence per share in addition to the
interim special dividend of 1.6 pence per
share. This equates to a further 25% (2009:
25%) of post tax profits. Any special
dividend in future years will depend upon
our future cash requirements and therefore
may vary.  
Capital structure
The Company’s shares are listed on the main
market of the London Stock Exchange.  The
Company’s authorised and issued share
capital during the year and as at 30 June
2010 are shown in note 22. 
The ordinary shares rank pari passu in all
respects.  Save as agreed at the Annual
General Meeting of the shareholders, the
ordinary shares have pre-emption rights in
respect of any future issues of ordinary shares
to the extent conferred by Section 561 of the
Companies Act.  
No unissued share or loan capital of the
Company is under option or agreed,
conditionally or unconditionally, to be put
under option.  The Trustees of the Company
Employee Benefit Trusts (EBTs), hold
Ordinary Shares either jointly owned with
employees or for the exercise of options under
the Company employee share schemes.
Restrictions on transfer of shares
At the time of the flotation of the Company
during May 2007, the then directors of the
Company and directors of the subsidiary
companies gave undertakings not to offer, sell
or contract to sell, pledge or otherwise dispose
of ordinary shares (directly or indirectly)
which were held by them on Admission to the
main market of the London Stock Exchange
and not sold as part of the flotation, other
than in certain limited circumstances.  The
restrictions apply as follows:
(i) Following the Results Announcement for
the financial year of the Company ending
on 30 June 2009 but prior to the Results
Announcement for the financial year of
the Company ending on 30 June 2010, to
such number of Shares as is equal to 50
per cent of the total number of Locked-in
Shares; and
(ii) Following the Results Announcement for
the financial year of the Company ending
on 30 June 2010 but prior to the Results
Announcement for the financial year of the
Company ending on 30 June 2011, to
such number of Shares as is equal to 25
per cent of the total number of Locked-in
Shares.  
The restrictions set out above shall cease to
apply in their entirety following the Results
Announcement for the financial year of the
Company ending on 30 June 2011.

Ian Gorham has been appointed as an
executive director and both Chris Barling and
Stephen Lansdown have been appointed as
non-executive directors on 26 August 2010.
Retirement and re-election of directors
In accordance with the Company’s Articles of
Association at each annual general meeting
any director who has been in office for more
than three years or more since their
appointment or last re-appointment must
retire ‘by rotation’. Those retiring shall also
include any director who wishes to retire.  A
separate resolution to reappoint any director
appointed since the last annual general
meeting must be proposed.   
Under the new UK Corporate Governance
Code which takes effect for financial years
beginning on or after 29 June 2010, all
directors should offer themselves up for re-
election annually.  The Company intends to
comply with the Code once the Company’s
Articles of Association have been
appropriately amended and will implement
annual re-election from the 2011 AGM.  
Ian Gorham has been appointed as an
executive director  and Chris Barling has been
appointed as a non-executive director on 26
August and both offer themselves for election
at the forth-coming annual general meeting of
26 November 2010. Also in accordance with
the existing Articles of Association both Peter
Hargreaves and Stephen Lansdown will be
proposed for re-election.  
Biographical details of the directors proposed
for election and re-election are shown on page
18.
The above figures are exclusive of any interests
under Share Options. Details of Share Options
which have been granted to directors as at the
date of this report pursuant to employee share
schemes are set out in the directors’
remuneration report.
After 30 June 2010 but prior to the date of this
report, Jonathan Davis, a non-executive
director, made a purchase of 2,500 shares,
which represents less than 0.01% of the
ordinary shares in issue.
Substantial shareholdings
As at 1 September 2010, the Company has not
been notified of any shareholdings amounting
to more than 3 per cent of the issued share
capital of the Company other than the
directors’ interests which are set out in the
Directors’ Report and the following
shareholding: 
Interested Date of Number Percentage

date of 
notification

Supplier payment policy
The Company’s policy, which is also applied
by the Group, is to settle terms of payment
with suppliers when agreeing the terms of
each transaction, ensure that suppliers are
made aware of the terms of payment and
abide by the terms of payment.  Trade
creditors of the Group at 30 June 2010 were
equivalent to 19 (2009: 26) days’ purchases,
based on the average daily amount invoiced
by suppliers during the year.
Critical accounting policies
The accounting policies adopted by Hargreaves
Lansdown have been consistently applied
throughout the current and prior year, except
as described as below, and are set out in note
2 to the financial statements.  The preparation
of our financial statements in accordance with
these policies has required management to
make a number of estimates, assumptions and
judgements. Further details on key sources of
judgements and estimation uncertainty are
provided in note 3 to the financial statements. 
Changes in accounting policy
In the current financial year, the Group has
adopted International Financial Reporting
Standard 8 “Operating Segments” and
International Accounting Standard 1
“Presentation of Financial Statements”
(revised 2007).
IFRS 8 requires operating segments to be
identified on the basis of internal reports
about components of the Group that are
regularly reviewed by the Chief Executive to
allocate resources to the segments and to
assess their performance.  In contrast, the
predecessor Standard (IAS 14 “Segment
Reporting”) required the Group to identify two
sets of segments (business and geographical),
using a risks and rewards approach.  As the
nature of the services provided, the regulatory
environment, the customer base and
distribution channels for each division are the
same, the consolidated entity operates in one
business segment  for the purposes of IAS 14
and hence no additional business segmental
analysis were shown in the 2009 accounts.
The comparatives in note 5 are presented in
accordance with IFRS 8.

IAS 1 (revised) requires the presentation of a
statement of changes in equity as a primary
statement, separate from the income statement
and statement of comprehensive income.  As a

Employment policies
Disabled employees
Applications for employment by disabled
persons are always given full and fair
consideration, bearing in mind the aptitudes
of the applicant concerned.  In the event of
members of staff becoming disabled, every
effort is made to ensure that their employment
with the Group continues and that appropriate
training is arranged.  It is the policy of the Group
that the training, career development and
promotion of disabled persons should, as far as
possible, be identical to that of other employees.
Health and welfare
Hargreaves Lansdown is committed to providing
a safe and healthy environment in which its
employees can work.   The Health and Safety
consultants who were previously engaged to
carry out a full review of our health and safety
policy and procedures, have been retained on
an ongoing basis to ensure that standards are
maintained. Now we are settled into the new
office a new Health & Safety Policy including
all underlying Procedures has been rewritten
and launched in August 2010. It is easier to

Employee consultation
Hargreaves Lansdown actively encourages
employee involvement and consultation and

of relevant information and corporate
announcements.  
Equality and diversity
Hargreaves Lansdown recognizes, respects and
values difference and diversity.  We are an equal
opportunities employer and it is our policy to
ensure that all job applicants and employees

practices and to ensure that this is evident to
employees in their day-to-day work.  Further
employment information is provided in the
Operating and Financial Review.
Client service

dealings with them and to provide a first class
service at all times. 
The fair treatment of our clients is central to
our corporate culture and we aim to provide

best prices to our clients. We strive to provide
clear information to all our clients and keep
them appropriately informed at all times
whilst they remain a client of Hargreaves

and investment performance meet our clients’
expectations.  We continually strive to improve
our services to ensure they are designed and
targeted appropriately and that any advice we
provide is suitable for our clients. We will
never impose unreasonable barriers to prevent

from making a complaint.
If clients ever feel the need to complain, our
complaints handling team carefully investigate
our client’s complaint and endeavour to

benchmark our performance in treating clients
fairly against statistics published annually by
the Financial Ombudsman Service for the
industry. The results for the 2010 financial year
compared to the last figures published by the
Ombudsman show that Hargreaves Lansdown
is achieving good results in treating our clients
fairly if they raise a complaint. 
Special business
Authority to purchase own shares
The Company was granted authority at the
AGM in 2009 to purchase its own shares up to
an aggregate value of 10% of the issued
nominal capital. This authority expires at this
year’s Annual General Meeting and a special
resolution will be proposed for its renewal.
Directors’ authority to allot shares and
waiver of pre-emption rights
Resolutions are to be proposed as special
business at the AGM on 26 November 2010 to
enable the directors to allot unissued shares and,
subject to the limits therein contained, to allot
shares for cash other than to existing shareholders
in proportion to their shareholdings. 
The resolution enabling directors to allot
unissued shares will be limited to the allotment
of shares up to a maximum nominal amount
of £202,725.50, which represented the
difference between the Company’s authorised
and issued share capital at 7 September 2010.
The directors do not have any present intention
of exercising such authority and the authority
will expire at the conclusion of the next AGM
after the passing of the proposed resolution.  
The resolution enabling the directors to allot
shares other than to existing shareholders in
proportion to their shareholdings is limited to
the allotment of shares up to a maximum
nominal value of £94,863.72, which
represents 5% of the total ordinary share
capital in issue as at 7 September 2010. 
Both of these resolutions seek authorities which
are in accordance with the current guidelines
issued by the Investment Committees of the
Association of British Insurers and the National
Association of Pension Funds.
Share schemes
A resolution is to be proposed as special
business at the 2010 AGM to enable the
directors to renew an existing share option
scheme.  The existing Executive Share Option
Scheme will be renewed and further details of
the scheme will be provided in the
shareholders’ Notice of AGM. 
Auditors
Each of the persons who are a director at the
date of approval of this annual report confirms
that:
• so far as the director is aware, there is no
relevant audit information of which the
Company's auditors are unaware; and
• the director has taken all the steps that
they ought to have taken as a director, in
order to make themselves aware of any
relevant audit information and to establish
that the Company's auditors are aware of
that information.
This confirmation is given and should be
interpreted in accordance with the provisions
of s418 of the Companies Act 2006. 
Deloitte LLP have expressed their willingness
to continue in office as auditors and a
resolution to reappoint them will be proposed
at the forthcoming Annual General Meeting.

8 September 2010 Corporate Governance Statement
Annual report and financial statements | Year ended 30 June 2010 22
BACK TO CONTENTS
In this section of our Annual Report and Accounts, we explain the key elements of the Group's corporate
governance structure. 
The directors of Hargreaves Lansdown plc are committed to high standards of corporate governance and
the Company is committed to the principles of corporate governance contained in the Revised Combined
Code on Corporate Governance that was published in June 2008 by the Financial Reporting Council (‘the
Code’) for which the Board is accountable to shareholders. 
Statement of compliance with the
Combined Code
During the year ended 30 June 2010,
Hargreaves Lansdown plc has applied the
principles and complied with the provisions
of Section 1 of the Combined Code on
Corporate Governance (‘the Code’) with the
following exceptions:
- Independence of the Chairman on
appointment
For the period up to 30 November 2009 the
Chairman did not meet the independence
criteria set out in the Code since he was an
executive director of the Company. The
Board considered that departure from the
Combined Code in this area was appropriate
and gave its reasons for non-compliance
both in the prospectus published as part of
the Company’s Initial Public Offering, and in
subsequent Annual Reports. With effect from
1 December 2009, the Group became
compliant with this provision of the Code,
following the appointment of Michael Evans
as non-executive Chairman.  
- Composition of the Board 
Following the appointment of Michael Evans
as Chairman on 1 December 2009, the
Company was no longer compliant with the
code in terms of having at least half of the
Board excluding the Chairman made up of
independent non-executive directors. The
Nominations Committee determined that a
new independent non-executive director
should be appointed and conducted a search
for a candidate who could bring skills and
experience to further complement the
existing board.  The appointment of Chris
Barling was subsequently made on 26
August 2010. On the same date Ian Gorham
was appointed an executive director and
Stephen Lansdown, having stood down as
an executive director was appointed as a
non-executive director, although under the
terms of the Code he cannot be deemed to be
independent. The resultant board, with
effect from 26 August 2010 comprised 3
executive directors, 3 independent non-
executive directors, a non-independent non-
executive director and a non-executive
chairman.  Whilst this does not comply with
the Code, we believe the presence of the two
founders who are also the largest
shareholders in the Company makes this a
very strong but not over-sized, board. 
- Composition of the Remuneration and
Audit Committees
Following the appointment of Michael Evans
as Chairman on 1 December 2009, the
Company was no longer compliant with the
code in terms of having at least three
independent non-executive directors on both
the Remuneration and the Audit
Committees. The Company became
compliant following the appointment of
Chris Barling as a new independent non-
executive on 26 August 2010 and his
appointment to both these committees. 
The Company’s auditor, Deloitte LLP , are
required to review whether the above
statement reflects the Company’s
compliance with the nine provisions of the
Combined Code specified for its review by
the Listing Rules and to report if it does not
reflect such compliance.  No such report has
been made.
Details of how Hargreaves Lansdown
complied with the Code are summarised in
this statement.
Statement about applying the
principles of the Code
The Company has applied the principles set
out in section 1 of the Code, including both
the main principles and the supporting
principles, by complying with the Code as
reported above.  Further explanation of how
the principles and supporting principles
have been applied is set out below and in the
directors’ remuneration report and Audit
Committee report.
DIRECTORS
Board of directors
As at 30 June 2010, the Board of Hargreaves
Lansdown comprised of 3 executive
members and 3 independent non-executive
directors. On 26 August 2010, Chris Barling
was appointed as an additional independent
non-executive. On the same date Ian Gorham
was appointed an executive director and
Stephen Lansdown stood down as an
executive director and was appointed as a
non-executive director. 
The Board is responsible to shareholders for
the proper management of the Group. All of
the directors bring strong judgement to
Board deliberations.  The Board is of
sufficient size and diversity that the balance
of skills and experience is considered to be
appropriate for the requirements of the
business.
The Chairman is responsible for the
operation, leadership and governance of the
Board, ensuring its effectiveness and setting
its agenda. The Chief Executive has executive
responsibilities for the operations, results
and strategic development of the Group.
Clear divisions of accountability and
responsibility exist and operate effectively
for these positions.
The Board requires all non-executive
directors to be independent in their
judgement and free from any business  or
other relationship that could interfere with
the exercise of objective judgement.   In
doing so, the Board gives due regard to
provision A.3.1 of the Combined Code. The
non-executive directors do not participate in
any of the Group’s share option or other
incentive schemes.
The Board concludes that Michael Evans,
Jonathan Davis, and Jonathan Bloomer were
independent directors throughout the
financial year. 
Biographies for the Board of directors,
including details of any other significant
directorships or appointments, are set out on
page 18.
Role of the Board
The Board determines the strategic direction
of the Group and reviews operating, Corporate Governance Statement

BACK TO CONTENTS
financial and risk performance. It is the
decision-making body for all other matters
deemed material to the Group in strategic,
financial and reputational terms. The non-
executive directors constructively challenge
the management team and supplement the
executive directors' management expertise
with a diversity of business skills and
experience. 
The Board and its Committees meet
regularly.  Formal minutes or reports of each
of these meetings are circulated to the
relevant members. 
The Board has delegated full authority to the
Executive Committee except for a list of
matters which are reserved for decision by
the Board.  There is a formal schedule of
those matters reserved to the Board, which
includes:
• approval of corporate strategies and
objectives; 
• approval of interim and final financial
results and payment of dividends; 
• the appointment of directors; 
• approval of major capital or revenue
expenditure; 
• approval of forecasts and medium term
plans; 
• approval of significant changes in the
Group structure and product range;
• corporate governance matters.
The Board has delegated the day-to-day
management of the Group to the Chief
Executive, who is supported by the executive
directors and senior executives. The Chief
Executive and executive directors of the
Group are responsible to the Board for
developing strategy and the profitability and
overall performance of the Group. 
Board responsibilities
The Board meets a minimum of four times
each financial year to discuss matters such
as current performance, long term planning,
material capital commitments and risk
management.  During the intervening
months, meetings of the Executive
Committee are held and minutes from the
meetings are circulated to the Board.
Board committees
There are a number of Committees of the
Board to which various matters are
delegated. The Committees all have formal
Terms of Reference that have been approved
by the Board, and performance of the
Committees are assessed annually by the
Board.  Terms of reference of the Audit,
Remuneration and Nomination Committee
are available on the Group’s website
(www.H-L.co.uk).  
Details are set out below:
Audit Committee
The Audit Committee is responsible for
assisting the Board in discharging its
responsibilities for financial reporting
including the integrity of the annual and
interim reports, preliminary results and any
other formal announcements relating to
financial performance, risk reporting and
reviewing the Company’s internal corporate
control.  The Audit Committee’s primary
responsibilities are to review the financial
statements, to review the Group’s internal
control and risk management systems, to
consider the appointment of the external
auditors, their independence and reports to
the Committee, as well as to review the
programme of Internal Audit.  
The responsibilities of the Audit Committee
and an explanation of how it applies the
principles of the Combined Code, are set out
in the Audit Committee report. 
The Audit Committee is chaired by Jonathan
Bloomer and its other members at 30 June
2010 were Michael Evans and Jonathan
Davis. Chris Barling was elected as an
additional member on 26 August 2010 and
Michael Evans stood down on the same date.
The Audit Committee meets at least three
times each year but more frequently when
required, and met five times during this
financial year.  On each occasion the Head of
Internal Audit, Group Compliance Director,
Group Finance Director and Chief Executive
were invited to attend.  The external auditors
attended all of the meetings.
Remuneration Committee
The Remuneration Committee is responsible
for the framework or broad policy for the fair
remuneration of the Executive Directors of
the Group as well as their performance
management.  These will be determined with
due regard to the interests of the Company
and the Shareholders.  It monitors the levels
and structure of remuneration for senior
management and seeks to ensure that they
are designed to attract, retain and motivate
the Executive Directors needed to run the
Company successfully.   
The Remuneration Committee meets at least
twice during each financial year, and met
five times during the current year.  The
Committee is chaired by Jonathan Bloomer
and its other members at 30 June 2010 were
Michael Evans and Jonathan Davis. Chris
Barling was elected as an additional member
on 26 August 2010.  The responsibilities of
the Remuneration Committee and an
explanation of how it applies the directors’
remuneration principles of the Combined
Code, are set out in the directors’
remuneration report.
The Nomination Committee
The Nomination Committee leads the
process for Board appointments, re-election
and succession of directors and the
Chairman. It is responsible for making
recommendations to the Board concerning
the composition of the Board including
proposed appointees to the Board, whether
to fill any vacancies that may arise or to
change the number of Board members.  
The Committee is chaired by Jonathan
Bloomer and its members at 30 June 2010
were Michael Evans and Jonathan Davis.
Chris Barling was elected as an additional
member on 26 August 2010. The Company
Secretary may also attend in her capacity as
Secretary of the Company.  The Nomination
Committee meets at least once each year.
The Committee met four times during the
year.
There is a formal, rigorous and transparent
procedure for the appointment of new directors
to the Board. This process will involve the
Nomination Committee interviewing suitable
candidates who are proposed by existing
Board members, by an external search company ,
or via searches performed by the Company
itself. Careful consideration will be given to
ensure appointees have enough time available
to devote to the role and that the balance of
skills, knowledge and experience on the Board
will be maintained. When the Committee has
found a suitable candidate, the Chairman of
the Committee will make a proposal to the
whole Board and the appointment is the
responsibility of the whole Board following
recommendation from the Committee. 
Under the existing Articles of Association all
directors have to submit themselves for re-
election at least every three years if they wish
to continue serving and are considered by the
Board to be eligible. In order to be able to
comply with the new UK Code of Corporate
Governance, however, all directors will need
to be re-elected on an annual basis. In order to
become compliant the Articles of Association
will be amended appropriately and as from Corporate Governance Statement
Annual report and financial statements | Year ended 30 June 2010 24
BACK TO CONTENTS
the AGM in 2011 annual re-election will be
implemented. For the forthcoming AGM on 26
November 2010 we are still operating under
the existing Articles of Association. 
During the year the Committee determined
that Michael Evans possessed the necessary
skills to fulfil the position of Chairman of the
Board. He was appointed as non-executive
Chairman with effect from 1 December 2009.
The Board believes that his skills and
experience and knowledge of the Group have
proved to be invaluable and hence positioned
him as the ideal candidate for the role.  As
such, it was not necessary to use an external
search consultancy or open advertising for
recruitment of a Chairman. 
Following on from the appointment of Ian
Gorham on 1 September 2009 as Chief
Operating Officer, the Committee subsequently
recommended his appointment as Deputy Chief
Executive on 26 April 2010, to join the Board
on 26 August 2010 and then to be appointed
to the position of Chief Executive, taking over
responsibility from Peter Hargreaves from 2
September 2010. The Committee believes that
the background he has had in financial services
whilst at Deloitte and as a Partner and Head
of Financial Services at Grant Thornton made
him an ideal successor to Peter Hargreaves to
continue the growth of Hargreaves Lansdown.
To bring more balance to the Board, the
Committee decided to appoint a further non-
executive director. Rather than engage a firm
of headhunters, it was decided that we would
advertise the position to a subset of our clients.
An initial mailing of some 8,000 clients
resulted in approximately 150 high quality
applications. Following the selection criteria
laid down by the Committee, and after two
rounds of interviews, we were delighted to
appoint Chris Barling to the Board on 26
August 2010. Chris is a client of Hargreaves
Lansdown and is currently CEO of Actinic, a
privately owned software company. We
believe Chris’ extensive IT experience will
bring greater breadth of knowledge and
experience to the Board.
Stephen Lansdown announced he wished to
stand down as an executive director but
indicated that he would be prepared to
continue to be involved with the Company as
a non-executive director. The Committee
recognised that the Board would benefit from
having Stephen’s great experience as a non-
executive director. His appointment was
confirmed on 26 August 2010.
Executive Committee
The Board has delegated full authority to the
Executive Committee subject to a list of
matters which are reserved for decision by the
full Board.  In particular the Executive
Committee is responsible to the Chief
Executive for developing and monitoring
every aspect of the Group businesses on a
continuing basis, for developing and
implementing business strategy as agreed by
the Board and ensuring that day to day
operations are conducted in accordance with
the relevant regulatory and statutory
requirements.
The Executive Committee is chaired by Ian
Gorham, and in his absence by Peter
Hargreaves.  During the year the committee
also comprised Stephen Lansdown, Tracey
Taylor, Nigel Bence, Andrew Christian,
Theresa Barry, Alex Davies, Ian Gorham, Nick
Marson and Ian Hunter.  Michael Evans is
invited to attend the Executive Committee.
The Executive Committee meets at least
quarterly but more frequently when required,
and met five times during the current
financial year.

Training
The Group’s overall objective is to maintain
and enhance professional standards for all
its employees.  It is particularly necessary to
maintain these standards for all staff who
fall under the scope of the Financial Services
Authority Training and Competence rules.
All directors and staff under the scope of
these rules are required to perform certain
training during a year.  
For all new directors, the Chairman is
responsible for preparing and implementing
a personalised induction programme
including guidance as to their duties,
responsibilities and liabilities as a director of
the Company.  The induction process can
include time with several of the senior
managers and executives in a number of
business areas and demonstrations of
systems where relevant. 
Every director has access to appropriate
training as required subsequent to
appointment.  The need for director training
is regularly assessed.
Performance evaluation
Individual appraisal of each director’s
performance is undertaken either by the
Chief Executive or Chairman each year and
involves meetings with each director on a
one-to one basis.   The non-executive
directors, led by the senior independent
director, carry out an appraisal of the
performance of the Chairman. 
Other information
Any director has access to the advice and
services of the Company Secretary and may
seek independent professional advice, if
necessary, at the Company’s expense. The
Company Secretary is responsible to the
Board for ensuring Board procedures are
followed.  Any removal or appointment of
the Company Secretary is decided by the
Board.
Simon Power stood down as Company
Secretary on 30 March 2010 and the Board
were delighted to appoint Judy Matthews as
the new Company secretary on the same day.
All directors may take independent
professional advice at the Company’s
expense in conducting their duties. 
RELATIONS WITH SHAREHOLDERS
Shareholder relations
The Company is committed to maintaining
good communications with shareholders
and has a programme of communication
with shareholders through interim and
annual reports, the AGM and the Investor
Relations section of the corporate website at
www.H-L.co.uk.  
It is intended that all directors will attend
each AGM and shareholders will be given the
opportunity to participate by asking
questions at the AGM on 26 November 2010.
In addition, the Chairman, Chief Executive
and Group Finance Director welcome
dialogue with individual institutional
shareholders in order to develop an
understanding of their views which are then
fed back to the Board. General presentations
are also given to analysts and investors
covering the annual and interim results. 
ACCOUNTABILITY AND AUDIT
Going concern
The financial statements are prepared on a
going concern basis as the directors are
satisfied that, at the time of approving the
financial statements, the Group has the
resources to continue in business for the
foreseeable future.
Internal control and risk management
The Board has overall responsibility for the
Company’s system of internal control and
risk management and for reviewing its
effectiveness. The directors are required to
establish systems for the control of the
conduct of the business and to conduct the
business with prudence and integrity.  In
discharging this responsibility, the Board
confirms that it has established the
procedures necessary to apply the Code,
including clear operating procedures, lines
of responsibility and delegated authority.
These procedures have been in place
throughout the year and are regularly
reviewed by the Board. Business
performance is managed closely and the
Board and Management has established
processes, as part of the normal good
management of the business, to monitor:
• progress towards strategic objectives;
• financial performance, within a
framework including forecasting,
financial reporting, reviewing variances
against plan and taking appropriate
management action; and
• risk management processes, which accord
with the Turnbull guidance and are
supported by reports from the Head of
Internal Audit that the significant risks
faced by the Company are being
identified, evaluated and appropriately
managed, having regard to the balance of
risk, cost and opportunity. 
The key features of the system of business
control and risk assessment established by
the Board include:
• a well defined management structure
with clear accountabilities and
delegations; 
• the Group Audit Committee, the Executive
Committee, and a system of executive risk
managers, which enhance and support
the oversight role of the Board; 
• management information systems which
enable the Board to receive
comprehensive monthly analysis of
financial and business performance;
• a Risk Management function led by the
Chief Risk Officer which reports to the
directors and non-executive directors on
the management of the major risks facing
the Group as assessed against the Group’s
Risk Appetite; 
• a Group Risk Strategy requiring all senior
managers to identify, evaluate and
manage risks in their business units, and
to monitor the effectiveness of internal
controls applied to these risks;
• an Internal Audit function which reports
to the Audit Committee on the
effectiveness of key internal controls
operated by each department or business
unit as part of the audit of that
department or unit; 
• a Compliance function to manage
relationships with the Group's key
regulators and to identify major
compliance and regulatory risks; and
• a Money Laundering Reporting Officer
(MLRO) and anti-money laundering
procedures, and controls including
training programmes for all staff. The
MLRO also specifically considers the risk
of loss through financial crime and the
controls in place to mitigate the risk of
such loss. 
In addition, the Audit Committee receives
reports from the Head of Internal Audit on the
work carried out under the annual internal
audit plan, and also reports from the external
auditors. Corporate Governance Statement
Annual report and financial statements | Year ended 30 June 2010 26
BACK TO CONTENTS
The Board has delegated oversight of the
Group's Internal Control Policy to the Audit
Committee. The Audit Committee received
reports on the current operation of internal
controls in relation to key and emerging risks,
and the Audit Committee carried out an
overall review of the effectiveness of the
Group's system of internal control for the year
to 30 June 2010 and the period to the date of
this report, on behalf of the Board.
The Board has delegated oversight of the
Group’s risk management policies and
procedures to the Audit Committee. Further
embedding of the process used for
identifying, evaluating and managing the
significant risks faced by the Group has
continued through the year. A summary of the
significant risks is provided within the
Operating and Financial Review.  This process
is regularly reviewed by the Board and
accords with the Turnbull Guidance for
directors on the Combined Code.
The Board receives minutes and reports from
the Chairman of the Audit Committee and the
Executive Committee. These identify any
significant issues relating to the adequacy of
the Group's system of internal control and to
the risk management policies and procedures
across the full range of risks to which the
Group is exposed, and how they are being
controlled. The Board, the Executive
Committee and the Audit Committee receive
reports from the Head of Internal Audit
identifying the effectiveness of internal
controls together with specific reports on any
major issues. 
The majority of the activities of the Group,
including the systems of business control, are
subject to supervision by the Financial
Services Authority. The Group is required on a
regular basis to submit detailed prudential
and statistical returns covering all areas of its
business and meets regularly with its
supervisors, conducting the relationship in an
open and constructive manner.
Through the monitoring processes set out
above, the Board has conducted a review of
the effectiveness of the system of internal
control during the year ended 30 June 2010.
The system of internal control is designed to
manage, rather than eliminate, the risk of
failure to achieve business objectives and
provide reasonable assurance as to the
effectiveness of the safeguards protecting the
business against the risk of material error,
loss or fraud. In that context, the review, in the
opinion of the Board, did not indicate that the
system was ineffective or unsatisfactory and
the Board is not aware of any change to this
status up to the approval of this Annual Report.
Model Code
The Company has its own internal dealing
rules which extend the FSA Listing Rules
Model Code provisions to all employees.
Audit Committee and auditors
The Audit Committee report on the following
pages provides details of the role and
activities of the Committee and its
relationship with the internal and external
auditors.
The UK Corporate Governance Code
The new Code was issued in May 2010 and
will apply for the financial year starting 1 July
2010. The Board is currently reviewing the
requirements of the new Code and seeking to
address areas of non-compliance.

Summary of the role of the 
Audit Committee
The Audit Committee is appointed by the
Board.  The Audit Committee’s terms of
reference include all matters indicated by the
Combined Code, and can be obtained from
the Group’s website at http://www.h-
l.co.uk/investor-relations/board-of-directors.
The terms of reference are considered
annually by the Audit Committee and are
then referred to the Board for approval.
The Audit Committee is responsible for:
• monitoring the integrity of the financial
statements of the Group and any formal
announcements relating to the Group’s
financial performance and reviewing
significant financial reporting judgements
contained therein;
• reviewing the Group’s internal financial
controls and, unless expressly addressed
by the Board itself, the Group’s internal
control and risk management systems;
• monitoring and reviewing the
effectiveness of the Group’s Internal Audit
function;
• making recommendations to the Board,
for a resolution to be put to the
shareholders for their approval in general
meetings, in relation to the appointment
of the external auditors and the approval
of the remuneration and terms of
engagement of the external auditors;
• reviewing and monitoring the external
auditors’ independence and objectivity
and the effectiveness of the audit process,
taking into consideration relevant UK
professional and regulatory requirements;
and
• developing and implementing a policy on
the engagement of the external auditors to
supply non-audit services, taking into
account relevant guidance regarding the
provision of non-audit services by the
external audit firm.
The Audit Committee is required to report its
findings to the Board, identifying any matters
in respect of which it considers that action or
improvement is needed, and make
recommendations as to the steps to be taken.
Composition of the Audit Committee
The members of the Audit Committee at 30
June 2010 are:
Date of 
Name appointment Qualification
J Bloomer 18 September 2006 Chartered 
accountant
M Evans 1 September 2006 Actuary
J Davis 1 February 2008
Chris Barling was elected an additional
member on 26 August 2010 and Michael
Evans stood down on the same date.
Biographies for each director can be found at
page 18.
During the year, the Committee comprised two
independent non-executive directors and the
non-executive chairman.  Two members
constitute a quorum. Membership of the
Committee is reviewed by the Chairman of the
Committee at regular intervals and any
recommendations for new appointments are
made to the Nomination Committee for onward
recommendation to the Board.  Appointments
are for a period of three years and are extendable
by no more than two additional three year
periods. The Audit Committee structure requires
the inclusion of one financially qualified member
(as recognised by the Consultative Committee
of Accountancy Bodies).  Currently the Audit
Committee Chairman fulfils this requirement. 
The Board expects the Audit Committee
members to have an understanding of:
• the principles of, contents of, and
developments in financial reporting
including the applicable accounting
standards and statements of
recommended practice;
• key aspects of the Group’s operations
including corporate policies, Group
financing, products and systems of
internal control;
• matters that influence or distort the
presentation of accounts and key figures;
• the principles of, and developments in,
company law, sector-specific laws and
other relevant corporate legislation;
• the role of internal and external auditing
and risk management;
• the regulatory framework for the Group’s
businesses; and
• environmental and social responsibility
best practices.
The Board is satisfied that all of the
Committee’s members have recent and
relevant commercial and financial knowledge
and experience to satisfy the provisions of the
Combined Code, by virtue of their having held
various executive and non-executive roles in
investment management and business
management. The Group provides an
induction programme for new Audit
Committee members and ongoing training to
enable all of the Committee members to carry
out their duties.  The induction programme
covers the role of the Audit Committee, its
terms of reference and expected time
commitment by members; and an overview of
the Group’s business, including the main
business and financial dynamics and risks.
New Committee members also meet some of
the Group’s staff.  Ongoing training includes
attendance at formal conferences, internal
company seminars and briefings by external
advisors.
Meetings
The Audit Committee is required to meet at
least three times per year and has an agenda
linked to events in the Group’s financial
calendar.  The agenda is predominantly
cyclical and is therefore approved by the
Audit Committee Chairman on behalf of his or
her fellow members.  Each Audit Committee
member has the right to require reports on
matters of interest in addition to the cyclical
items.
The Audit Committee invites the Chief
Executive, Group Finance Director, Head of
Internal Audit, Group Compliance Director
and senior representatives of the external
auditors to attend all of its meetings in full,
although it reserves the right to request any of
these individuals to withdraw.  Other senior
management are invited to present such
reports as are required for the Committee to
discharge its duties.
Overview of the actions taken by the
Audit Committee to discharge its
duties
During the 12 months to 30 June 2010 the
Audit Committee has undertaken the
following key responsibilities: Audit Committee Report

Adequacy Assessment Process (‘ICAAP’)
report; and
• reviewed its own effectiveness.
External auditors
The Audit Committee is responsible for the
development, implementation and
monitoring of the Group’s policy on external
audit.  The policy assigns oversight
responsibility for monitoring the
independence, objectivity and compliance
with ethical and regulatory requirements to
the Audit Committee, and day to day
responsibility to the Group Finance Director.
The policy states that the external auditors
are jointly responsible to the Board and the
Audit Committee and that the Audit
Committee is the primary contact.
The Group’s policy on external audit sets out
the categories of non-audit services which the
external auditors will and will not be allowed
to provide to the Group, subject to de minimis
levels and Audit Committee Chairman
approval.
Having conducted a review of the
independence and the effectiveness of the
external auditors the Audit Committee has
recommended to the Board that they are re-
appointed.
Internal Audit function
The Audit Committee is required to assist the
Board to fulfil its responsibilities relating to
the adequacy of the resourcing and plans of
the Internal Audit department.   Having
conducted a review of the Internal Audit
department the Committee is happy with their
resources and plans.
The Audit Committee has also approved the
Group’s Whistleblowing Policy that contains
arrangements for the Head of Internal Audit
to receive, in confidence, complaints on
accounting, risk issues, internal controls,
auditing issues and related matters for
reporting to the Audit Committee as
appropriate.
Overview
As a result of its work during the year, the
Audit Committee has concluded that it has
acted in accordance with its terms of
reference and has ensured the independence
and objectivity of the external auditors.
The Chairman of the Audit Committee will be
available at the Annual General Meeting to
answer any questions about the work of the
Committee.

8 September 2010 Directors’ Remuneration Report
Annual report and financial statements | Year ended 30 June 2010 29
BACK TO CONTENTS
Introduction
This report has been prepared in accordance
with Schedule 8 to the Accounting Regulations
under the Companies Act 2006.  The report
also meets the relevant requirements of the
Listing Rules of the Financial Services
Authority and describes how the Board has
applied the principles relating to directors’
remuneration.  As required by the Act, a
resolution to approve the report will be
proposed at the Annual General Meeting of
the Company.
The Act requires the auditors to report to the
Company’s members on certain parts of the
directors’ remuneration report and to state
whether in their opinion those parts of the
report have been properly prepared in
accordance with the Companies Act 2006.
The report has therefore been divided into
separate sections for audited and unaudited
information.
UNAUDITED INFORMATION
Remuneration Committee
This report deals with the remuneration
policies and the work of the Remuneration
Committee in the year ended 30 June 2010.
The Company has a Remuneration Committee
which is responsible for the policy for the fair
remuneration of the executive Directors of the
Company and its subsidiaries as well as their
performance management.  The policy is to be
determined with due regard to the interests of
the Company and the Shareholders.  The
Committee makes recommendations to the
Board.  No director plays a part in any
discussion about his or her own
remuneration. The Remuneration Committee
will meet at least twice per year and is
governed by formal Terms of Reference. The
terms are reviewed annually and can be
viewed at www.H-L.co.uk.
The Committee is chaired by Jonathan
Bloomer. The members of the Committee
throughout the financial year were Jonathan
Bloomer, Michael Evans and Jonathan Davis
who are independent non-executive directors.
Chris Barling was elected as an additional
member on 26 August 2010.  None of the
Committee has any personal financial interest
(other than as shareholders), conflicts of
interests arising from cross-directorships or
day-to-day involvement in running the
business.  
In determining the Directors’ remuneration
for the year and the revised remuneration
structure for the current financial year, the
Committee consulted Peter Hargreaves,
Stephen Lansdown and Ian Gorham about its
proposals. These Directors may attend
meetings at the invitation of the Committee
except when their own remuneration is being
discussed.    
The role of the Committee
The Committee’s purpose is to:
• determine and recommend to the Board
the remuneration policy for the executive
directors of the Company and of the
subsidiary companies;
• ensure the level and structure of
remuneration is designed to attract,
retain, and motivate the executive
directors needed to run the Company and
the Group; and 
• monitor the level and structure of
remuneration for senior management.
The performance measurement of the
executive directors and key members of senior
management and the determination of their
annual remuneration package are undertaken
by the Committee.  The Committee also
ensures that the remuneration relationship
between the executive directors and senior
employees of the Company is appropriate.
Any exceptional remuneration arrangements
for senior employees are advised to the
Committee. 
Executive Directors’ contracts
The Company’s policy is that executive
directors should have contracts with an
indefinite term and a maximum of one year’s
notice.  All executive directors currently have
contracts which are subject to one year’s
notice by either party.  The Company may at
any time exercise its discretion to pay
executives in lieu of the notice period.  The
details of the directors’ contracts are
summarised in the table below:
Name of Contract Notice 
director date period
P Hargreaves 5 April 2007 12 months
S Lansdown * 5 April 2007 12 months
T Taylor 1 Nov 2008 12 months
* S Lansdown resigned from his service contract as an 
executive director on 26 August 2010 and both parties
waived the 12 month notice period.
Hargreaves Lansdown recognises that its
executive directors may be invited to become
non-executive directors of other companies.
Such non-executive duties can broaden
experience and knowledge which can benefit
the Company. Subject to approval by the
Board, executive directors are allowed to
accept non-executive appointments and
retain the fees received, provided that these
appointments are not likely to lead to
conflicts of interest. Peter Hargreaves
currently receives fees of £45,000 p.a. in
respect of his duties as a non-executive of ITM
Power plc. 
Executive directors’ contracts of service which
include details of remuneration will be
available for inspection at the Annual General
Meeting.
Remuneration policy for executive
directors of the Company and
subsidiary companies
The remuneration policy of the Group is
designed to attract, motivate and retain
directors of the calibre needed to maintain the
Group’s position as a market leader and to
reward them for enhancing shareholder
value.  
The Committee believes that a significant
proportion of total remuneration should be
performance-related to closely align the
interests of shareholders and executive
directors of the Group.  Our policy is to pay
relatively low basic salaries but to give
executive directors and senior managers the
opportunity to earn large bonuses for
exceptional performance together with the
benefits of participation in share option and
share award schemes. Executives are
encouraged to accumulate personal holdings
in Hargreaves Lansdown plc shares. 
Bonuses are based on achievements such as
delivering long term profit growth, managing
risk, improving customer service and
satisfaction, and achieving efficiencies, all of
which contribute directly to the value of the
business.  The Group’s profits quickly turn
into cash, and the risk of unexpected losses
arising in the future from unrealised or
deferred liabilities is low.  As long as the
Remuneration Committee is satisfied that the
performance which generates a bonus has
been sustained, and the expected profits and
cash flows have already materialised, it
considers there is no formal requirement for
bonus deferral or clawback provision.
However, new bonus deferral and minimum
shareholding arrangements are being
introduced. These new arrangements are
described below.
An important corollary of this policy is that
bonuses will be generous in years when the
Group’s performance is good, but more frugal
if profitability or the growth in profit
deteriorates.  If the performance of the
business turns down, the directors and most Directors’ Remuneration Report
Annual report and financial statements | Year ended 30 June 2010 30
BACK TO CONTENTS
senior members of staff expect to experience
the biggest reductions in bonus, both in
monetary and percentage terms.  
In the year ended 30 June 2010, there were
five main elements of the remuneration
package for executive directors and senior
management:
• basic annual salary;
• annual bonus payments; 
• share option and share awards;
• pension arrangements; and
• benefits-in-kind
Basic annual salary 
The policy for executive directors of the
Company and of the subsidiary companies is
that basic annual salary should provide
adequate but not generous remuneration.
An executive director’s basic salary is
reviewed annually by the Committee prior to
the beginning of each financial year and
when an individual changes position or
responsibility.  In deciding appropriate levels,
the Committee considers salaries throughout
the Group as a whole, survey data,
information provided by advisors and up-to-
date information on a comparator group of
companies in the financial sector.
Annual bonus payments
The directors’ service contracts provide that
the executives may be paid a discretionary
bonus for each financial year of the Company.
The Committee believes that any incentive
compensation awarded should be tied to the
interests of the Company’s shareholders.
Therefore in determining the size of the
annual bonus pot to be distributed, the
principal measure used is Earnings Per Share.
In determining the bonuses, regard is given to
the performance of the individual, the relative
success of parts of the business for which the
executive director is responsible, and the
extent to which the strategic objectives set by
the Board are being met.  
The Committee does not generally consider it
appropriate to set an upper limit on
discretionary awards, however there is a cap
on the bonuses of Stephen Lansdown and
Peter Hargreaves of 300% of salary. Annual
bonus payments to the other executive
directors, management and staff are not capped.
All bonus payments are not pensionable.
Share option and award incentives
The executive directors of the Company and
subsidiary companies may have options
granted to them under the terms of the
Executive Share Option Scheme.  Options
under this scheme may be granted to
employees and directors of the Group as
selected by the Remuneration Committee.
Under that scheme, options are allocated to
qualifying employees and directors by
reference to individual past performance and
therefore the exercise of options granted
under the Executive Scheme are not
dependent upon performance criteria as that
performance has already been demonstrated.    
The executive directors of the Company and
subsidiary companies are entitled to
participate in the SAYE share option scheme
on the same terms as all other employees.
They are also entitled to participate in the
Share Incentive Plan (SIP) on the same terms
as all other employees.   
The exercise price of the options granted
under the above schemes is equal to the
market value of the Company’s shares at the
time when the options are granted.  Benefits
received under share incentive schemes are
not pensionable.     
At the 2009 Annual General Meeting,
shareholders approved a new Executive Joint
Share Ownership Plan (JSOP).  Similar
schemes are often referred to as Share
Appreciation Rights, the key feature being
that Directors and other executives pay for
their interest in the shares at the outset but
only benefit if there is further growth in the
value of the Company’s share price, subject to
any conditions attached to the award.  The
Remuneration Committee is of the view that
this new scheme links rewards, performance
and the creation of value for shareholders in
an effective way, although we also plan to
retain the existing option schemes for use
when appropriate.  Our Employee Benefit
Trust (EBT) is well funded and holds
sufficient shares to satisfy all outstanding
options under all current share schemes.
Pension arrangements
No directors or staff participate in a defined
benefit pension scheme.  The Group operates
its own Group Self Invested Personal Pension
(the “GSIPP”).  The GSIPP is non-contributory
and allows staff to take more control of their
pension planning.  The Company contributes
4% of salary to the scheme: bonuses and
other benefits are not pensionable.
Employees wishing to make personal
contributions to the GSIPP can do so via
‘salary exchange’ ensuring that they benefit
from maximum, immediate relief from
income tax and National Insurance
Contributions (NIC).  Peter Hargreaves and
Stephen Lansdown do not participate in the
GSIPP .
Beneﬁts-in-kind
All staff and directors are entitled to life
assurance cover of three times their salary
and, subject to the rules of the scheme,
permanent health insurance.  The executive
directors may also receive certain benefits-in-
kind.  
Revised arrangements for current
ﬁnancial year
For the current financial year, on the
recommendation of the new Chief Executive,
Ian Gorham, the Remuneration Committee
has agreed to amend the variable
discretionary elements of the remuneration
package for the executive directors of the
Company and its subsidiaries.
Each executive director shall continue to
receive the five elements of remuneration
described above.  For the first £300,000 of
the total rewards amount (being salary and
annual bonus), the excess above the salary is
payable as an immediate cash bonus. For the
excess of total rewards amounts over
£300,000, executives can either take the
balance as an immediate cash bonus or to
receive JSOP shares in the ratio of 2 JSOP
shares for £1 of reward. There is an overriding
condition that each executive must have a
minimum shareholding in the Company of
500,000 shares (including JSOP shares) or
£250,000 in deferred bonus, and until that
condition is satisfied, reward amounts over
the £300,000 threshold must be deferred.
It is the opinion of the new Chief Executive
that further establishing a link between
successful Director performance and equity
participation is to the benefit of shareholders
in retaining key talent. Establishing a de-
minimis shareholding for Directors
encourages long term commitment and
behaviours aligned with sustainable profit.
The Company Directors and the
Remuneration Committee unanimously
support the new arrangements, which were
introduced on 1 July 2010. The Financial
Services Authority recently published a
consultation paper titled “Revising the
Remuneration Code” in July 2010, which is
due to be finalised in November 2010 and
effective from 1 January 2011. The
Remuneration Committee will consider
whether these new arrangements need to be
amended in light of this consultation paper.  Directors’ Remuneration Report

Outcome of review by Remuneration Committee 
The Committee reviewed the remuneration packages in the light of the Group’s strong performance. Full year profits were again ahead of the
market analysts’ consensus, costs have been controlled, earnings per share have improved and dividends have increased. Despite the ongoing
economic uncertainty, once again these represent excellent results.
Performance graph 
The following graph shows the Company’s performance, measured by Total Shareholder Return (TSR) i.e. capital growth and dividends paid,
compared with the performance of the FTSE 350 Financial Services Index during the period since flotation.  
As the Company was not listed on a stock
exchange prior to May 2007, a comparison of
TSR prior to 15 May 2007 has not been
possible due to the absence of a quoted share
price.  
The Company’s performance measured using
underlying adjusted earnings per share (EPS)
has also been compared against the
performance of the FTSE 350 General
Financial Index.
The Committee reviewed the overall remuneration of the executives.  Although profits have increased, the Committee agreed that given the
current economic environment a more restrained approach, in particular to bonuses, was appropriate.  Therefore basic salaries of the Board
executives were reviewed during the year with no increases taking effect.  Further it was agreed with effect from 1 July 2010 that the salary and
benefits of Peter Hargreaves would be reduced from £406,000 to an amount of circa £60,000, and with effect from 1 March 2010 that the salary
of Stephen Lansdown would be reduced from £275,000 to nil, until 26 August 2010 at which time he shall be paid fees of £30,000 p.a. for his
position as non-executive director. The salary of the new Chief Executive, Ian Gorham, was agreed at £450,000 from 2 September 2010, being
the date of his appointment. The Committee also agreed that Peter Hargreaves and Stephen Lansdown would not receive bonuses for the year
(2009: £600,000 and £350,000 respectively) and that Tracey Taylor should receive a bonus of £75,000 (2009: £250,000). The bonuses paid to
executive directors of the Company and of the subsidiary companies averaged 0.54 times salary and varied between nil and 1.68 times salary
(2009: average 1.88 times, varied between half and four times). Looking forward, strong performance in future years is likely to generate more
generous total rewards.

Annual report and financial statements | Year ended 30 June 2010 32
BACK TO CONTENTS
Non-executive directors
All non-executive directors have specific terms of engagement, which are available for inspection, and their remuneration is determined by
the Board within the limits set by the Articles of Association and based on independent surveys of fees paid to non-executive directors of
similar companies.  
Each non-executive director is a member of the Remuneration Committee, Nomination Committee and Audit Committee, and the basic fee of
£30,000 to £40,000 p.a.  paid (depending on experience) includes a fee for membership of each committee. Additional fees of £15,000 p.a.
are paid to Jonathan Bloomer for chairmanship of the three committees. The non-executive chairman is also a member of each of the
Committees and is paid a total fee of £90,000 p.a. Stephen Lansdown and Chris Barling who were both appointed as non-executive directors
as from 26 August 2010 will both receive a basic fee of £30,000 p.a. Non-executive directors cannot participate in any of the Company’s
share option schemes and are not eligible to join the Company’s pension scheme.
Appointments are for a fixed term of three years from the commencement date unless terminated by either party on three months' written
notice or by the Company at any time with immediate effect on payment in lieu of notice. 
Non-executive directors are entitled to reimbursement of all reasonable and properly documented travel, hotel and other incidental expenses
incurred in the performance of their duties and the Company maintains appropriate directors' and officers' liability insurance for their benefit.

8 September 2010 Directors’ Responsibilities Statement
Annual report and financial statements | Year ended 30 June 2010 34
BACK TO CONTENTS
Company law requires the directors to prepare financial statements for
each financial year.  Under that law the directors are required to
prepare the Group financial statements in accordance with
International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the
European Union and Article 4 of the IAS Regulation and have also
chosen to prepare the parent company financial statements under
IFRSs as adopted by the EU.  Under company law the directors must
not approve the accounts unless they are satisfied that they give a true
and fair view of the state of affairs of the Company and of the profit or
loss of the Company for that period.  In preparing these financial
statements, International Accounting Standard 1 requires that
directors:
• properly select and apply accounting policies;
• present information, including accounting policies, in a manner
that provides relevant, reliable, comparable and understandable
information; 
• provide additional disclosures when compliance with the specific
requirements in IFRSs are insufficient to enable users to
understand the impact of particular transactions, other events and
conditions on the entity's financial position and financial
performance; and
• make an assessment of the Company's ability to continue as a
going concern.
The directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting records
that are sufficient to show and explain the company’s transactions
and disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial
position of the company and enable them to ensure that the financial
statements comply with the Companies Act 2006.  They are also
responsible for safeguarding the assets of the company and hence for
taking reasonable steps for the prevention and detection of fraud and
other irregularities.
The directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity of the
corporate and financial information included on the company’s
website.  Legislation in the United Kingdom governing the preparation
and dissemination of financial statements may differ from legislation
in other jurisdictions.
Responsibility statement
We confirm that to the best of our knowledge:
• the financial statements, prepared in accordance with
International Financial Reporting Standards, give a true and fair
view of the assets, liabilities, financial position and profit or loss of
the Company and the undertakings included in the consolidation
taken as a whole; and
• the management report, which is incorporated into the directors'
report, includes a fair review of the development and performance
of the business and the position of the Company and the
undertakings included in the consolidation taken as a whole,
together with a description of the principal risks and uncertainties
that they face.

Income Statement, the Group and Parent Company Statement of
Comprehensive Income, the Group and Parent Company Statements
of Changes in Equity, the Group and Parent Company Balance
Sheets, the Group and Parent Company Statements of Cash Flows
and the related notes 1 to 28.  The financial reporting framework
that has been applied in their preparation is applicable law and
International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by
the European Union and as regards the parent company financial
statements, as applied in accordance with the provisions of the
Companies Act 2006.
This report is made solely to the Company’s members, as a body, in
accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies Act 2006.  
Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might state to the
Company’s members those matters we are required to state to them in
an auditors’ report and for no other purpose.  To the fullest extent
permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility to anyone
other than the Company and the Company’s members as a body, for
our audit work, for this report, or for the opinions we have formed.
Respective responsibilities of directors and auditors
As explained more fully in the Directors’ Responsibilities Statement,
the directors are responsible for the preparation of the financial
statements and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view.
Our responsibility is to audit the financial statements in accordance
with applicable law and International Standards on Auditing (UK
and Ireland).  Those standards require us to comply with the
Auditing Practices Board’s (APB’s) Ethical Standards for Auditors.
Scope of the audit of the ﬁnancial statements
An audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts and
disclosures in the financial statements sufficient to give reasonable
assurance that the financial statements are free from material
misstatement, whether caused by fraud or error.  This includes an
assessment of: whether the accounting policies are appropriate to
the group’s and the parent company’s circumstances and have been
consistently applied and adequately disclosed; the reasonableness of
significant accounting estimates made by the directors; and the
overall presentation of the financial statements.
Opinion on ﬁnancial statements
In our opinion:
• the financial statements give a true and fair view of the state of
the group’s and of the parent company’s affairs as at 30 June
2010 and of the group’s profit for the year then ended;
• the group financial statements have been properly prepared in
accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the European Union;
• the parent company financial statements have been properly
prepared in accordance with IFRS’s as adopted by the European
Union and as applied in accordance with the provisions of the
Companies Act 2006; and
• the financial statements have been prepared in accordance with
the requirements of the Companies Act 2006 and, as regards the
group financial statements, Article 4 of the IAS Regulation.
Opinion on other matters prescribed by the 
Companies Act 2006
In our opinion:
• the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited has
been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act
2006; and
• the information given in the Directors’ Report for the financial
year for which the financial statements are prepared is consistent
with the financial statements.
Matters on which we are required to report by exception
We have nothing to report in respect of the following:
Under the Companies Act 2006 we are required to report to you if, in
our opinion:
• adequate accounting records have not been kept by the parent
company, or returns adequate for our audit have not been
received from branches not visited by us; or 
• the  parent company financial statements and the part of the
Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited are not in
agreement with the accounting records and returns; or
• certain disclosures of directors’ remuneration specified by law
are not made; or 
• we have not received all the information and explanations we
require for our audit.
Under the Listing Rules we are required to review:
• the directors’ statement contained within the Directors’ Report in
relation to going concern; and
• the part of the Corporate Governance Statement relating to the
Company’s compliance with the nine provisions of the June 2008
Combined Code specified for our review.

The share premium account represents the difference between the issue price and the nominal value of shares issued. 
The investment revaluation reserve represents the change in fair value of available-for-sale investments held by the Group, net of deferred tax.
The capital redemption reserve relates to the repurchase and cancellation of the Company's own shares. 
The Shares held by Employee Benefit Trust (“the EBT”) reserve represents the cost of shares in Hargreaves Lansdown plc purchased in the
market and held by the Hargreaves Lansdown plc Employee Benefit Trust to satisfy options under the Group’s share option schemes. 
The EBT reserve represents the cumulative gain on disposal of investments held by the Hargreaves Lansdown EBT.  The reserve is not distributable
by the Company as the assets and liabilities of the EBT are subject to management by the Trustees in accordance with the EBT trust deed.
The share option reserve represented the effect of share-based payments and associated tax.  From 31 December 2009 this has been shown
within retained earnings rather than as a separate reserve.
Non-controlling interests in the net assets of consolidated subsidiaries are identified separately from the Group’s equity therein.  Non-controlling
interests consist of the minority’s proportion of the net fair value of the assets and liabilities acquired at the date of the original business
combination and the non-controlling interest’s change in equity since that date.  The non-controlling interest represents a 15% shareholding in
Library Information Services Limited, a subsidiary of the Company.

1. General information
Hargreaves Lansdown plc (the “Company”) is a company incorporated in the United Kingdom under the Companies Act 2006 whose shares
are publicly traded on the London Stock Exchange. The address of the registered office is One College Square South, Anchor Road, Bristol
BS1 5HL, United Kingdom. The nature of the Group’s operations and its principal activities are set out in the Operating and Financial Review. 
These financial statements are presented in pounds sterling which is the currency of the primary economic environment in which the Group
operates. 
Basis of preparation
The consolidated financial statements of Hargreaves Lansdown plc have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting
Standards adopted by the International Accounting Standards Board (“IASB”) and interpretations issued by the International Financial
Reporting Interpretations Committee of the IASB (together “IFRS”) as adopted by the European Union. The Company's financial statements
have been prepared on the same basis and as permitted by Section 408 of the Companies Act 2006, no income statement is presented for the
Company.  The Company’s profit after tax for the year was £54,336,000 (2009: £46,150,000).
At the date of the authorisation of the financial statements the following standards and interpretations, which are relevant to the Group but
have not been applied in the financial statements, were in issue but not yet effective:
IAS 1 Amendment - Presentation of financial statements
IAS 7 Amendment - Statement of cash flows
IAS 17 Amendment - Leases
IAS 24 Revised - Related party disclosures
IAS 27 Amendment - Consolidated and separate financial statement
IAS 32 Amendment - Financial instruments: Presentation
IAS 36 Amendment - Impairment of assets
IAS 39 Amendment - Financial instruments: Recognition and measurement
IFRS 2 Amendment - Share-based payments
IFRS 5 Amendment - Non-current assets held for sale and discontinued operations
IFRS 7 Amendment - Financial instruments: Disclosures
IRFS 8 Amendment - Operating segments
IFRS 9 Financial instruments - Classification and measurement
IFRIC 19 Extinguishing financial liabilities with equity instruments
The full impact of these pronouncements is being assessed by the Group.  However, the initial view is that the directors anticipate that the
future adoption of those standards, interpretations and amendments listed above will not have a material impact on the Group’s results
reported within the financial statements other than requiring additional disclosure or alternative presentation.
The financial statements have been prepared on the historical cost basis, except for the revaluation of certain financial instruments. The
principal accounting policies adopted are set out below.
2. Signiﬁcant accounting policies
Accounting policies as shown below have been consistently applied throughout the current and prior financial year.
Changes in accounting policy
In the current financial year, the Group has adopted International Financial Reporting Standard (“IFRS”) 8 “Operating Segments” and
International Accounting Standard (“IAS”) 1 “Presentation of Financial Statements” (revised 2007).
IFRS 8 requires operating segments to be identified on the basis of internal reports about components of the Group that are regularly
reviewed by the Chief Executive to allocate resources to the segments and to assess their performance.  In contrast, the predecessor Standard
(IAS 14 “Segment Reporting”) required the Group to identify two sets of segments (business and geographical), using a risks and rewards
approach.  As the nature of the services provided, the regulatory environment, the customer base and distribution channels for each division
are the same, the consolidated entity operated in one business segment  for the purposes of IAS 14 and hence no additional business
segmental analysis were shown in the 2009 accounts.  The comparatives in note 5 are presented in accordance with IFRS 8.  
IAS 1 (revised) requires the presentation of a statement of changes in equity as a primary statement, separate from the income statement and
statement of comprehensive income.  As a result, a consolidated and company only statement of changes in equity has been included in the
primary statements, showing changes in each component of equity for each period presented. Notes to the Financial Statements (continued)

2. Signiﬁcant accounting policies (continued)
Basis of consolidation
The consolidated financial statements incorporate the financial statements of the Company and entities controlled by the Company (its
subsidiaries) made up to 30 June 2010.  Control is achieved where the Company has the power to govern the financial and operating policies
of an investee entity so as to obtain benefits from its activities.
The results of subsidiaries acquired or disposed of during the year are included in the consolidated income statement from the effective date
of acquisition or up to the effective date of disposal, as appropriate.    
Where necessary, adjustments are made to the financial statements of subsidiaries to bring the accounting policies used into line with those
used by the Group.  All intra-group transactions, balances, income and expenses are eliminated on consolidation.
The Group and Company financial statements are prepared on a going concern basis as discussed on pages 19 and 25.
Business combinations 
The acquisition of subsidiaries is accounted for using the purchase method. The cost of the acquisition is measured at the aggregate of the
fair values, at the date of exchange, of assets given, liabilities incurred or assumed, and equity instruments issued by the Group in exchange
for control of the acquiree, plus any costs directly attributable to the business combination. The acquiree’s identifiable assets, liabilities and
contingent liabilities that meet the conditions for recognition under IFRS 3 “Business Combinations” are recognised at their fair value at the
acquisition date. 
Any gains or losses on sale of the Company’s own shares held by the Hargreaves Lansdown Employee Benefit Trust (“EBT”) are credited
directly to the EBT reserve and are treated as undistributable profits.
Non-current assets held for sale
Non-current assets (and disposal groups) classified as held for sale are measured at the lower of carrying amount and fair value less costs to
sell.  Non-current assets and disposal groups are classified as held for sale if their carrying amount will be recovered through a sale
transaction rather than through continuing use. This condition is regarded as met only when the sale is highly probable and the asset (or
disposal group) is available for immediate sale in its present condition. Management must be committed to the sale which should be
expected to qualify for recognition as a completed sale within one year from the date of classification.
Goodwill
Goodwill arising on consolidation represents the excess of the cost of acquisition over the Group’s interest in the fair value of the identifiable
assets and liabilities of a subsidiary, associate, or jointly controlled entity at the date of acquisition. Goodwill is initially recognised as an
asset at cost and is subsequently measured at cost less any accumulated impairment losses. Goodwill which is recognised as an asset is
reviewed for impairment at least annually. Any impairment is recognised immediately in profit or loss and is not subsequently reversed.
On disposal of a subsidiary, associate or jointly controlled entity, the attributable amount of goodwill is included in the determination of the
profit or loss on disposal.
Goodwill arising on acquisitions before the date of transition to IFRS on 1 July 2005 has been retained at the previous UK GAAP amounts
subject to being tested for impairment at that date. Goodwill written off to reserves under UK GAAP prior to 30 June 1997 has not been
reinstated and is not included in determining any subsequent profit or loss on disposal.
Revenue recognition
Revenue is measured at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable and represents amounts receivable for services provided in
the normal course of business, net of discounts, VAT and other sales-related taxes. Fund based commissions are recognised on an accruals
basis calculated according to the level of assets under the administration, or agency, of the Group.  Initial commissions are deemed to be
earned at the policy inception date, except in the case of the Group’s stockbroking and unit trust management subsidiary undertakings where
all income earned on securities transactions entered into on behalf of clients are recorded in the accounts on the date of the transaction.
Where commission is received on an indemnity basis, a provision is made for clawbacks which would be due if the policy lapses during the
indemnity period.   
Interest income is accrued on a time basis, using the effective interest rate method.
Dividend income from investments is recognised when the shareholders’ rights to receive payment have been established. Notes to the Financial Statements (continued)

BACK TO CONTENTS
2. Signiﬁcant accounting policies (continued)
Operating profit
Operating profit is stated before investment revenue and finance costs. Adjusted operating profit is stated before investment revenue, finance
costs and one-off costs relating to new offices.
Retirement benefit costs 
The Group operates a group self invested personal pension plan for staff.  Payments to the defined contribution retirement benefit scheme are
charged as an expense as they fall due.
Bonuses payable to employees
The Group recognises a liability and an expense for staff bonuses where contractually obliged or where there is a past practice.  
Provisions
Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present obligation as a result of a past event, and it is probable that the Group will be
required to settle that obligation. Provisions are measured at the directors’ best estimate of the expenditure required to settle the obligation at
the balance sheet date, and are discounted to present value where the effect is material. 
Provisions are recognised for future committed property lease payments when the group receives no benefit from the property through
continuing usage and future receipts from any sub-letting arrangements are not in excess of the group’s future committed payments.
Taxation
The tax expense represents the sum of the tax currently payable and deferred tax.  The tax currently payable is based on taxable profit for the
year. Taxable profit differs from net profit as reported in the income statement because it excludes items of income or expense that are
taxable or deductible in other years and it further excludes items that are never taxable or deductible. The Group’s liability for current tax is
calculated using tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is the tax expected to be payable or recoverable on differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in the
financial statements and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable profit, and is accounted for using the balance sheet
liability method. Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised for all taxable temporary differences and deferred tax assets are recognised
to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available against which deductible temporary differences can be utilised. Such
assets and liabilities are not recognised if the temporary difference arises from the initial recognition of goodwill or from the initial
recognition (other than in a business combination) of other assets and liabilities in a transaction that affects neither the tax profit nor the
accounting profit.
Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for taxable temporary differences arising on investments in subsidiaries and associates, except where
the Group is able to control the reversal of the temporary difference and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the
foreseeable future.
The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each balance sheet date.  Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is
probable that sufficient taxable profits will be available to allow all or part of the asset to be recovered.
Deferred tax is calculated at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the year when the liability is settled or the asset is realised. Deferred
tax is charged or credited in the income statement, except when it relates to items charged or credited directly to equity, in which case the
deferred tax is also dealt with in equity.  Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to set off current
tax assets against current tax liabilities and when they relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority and the Group intends to
settle its current tax assets and liabilities on a net basis.
Share-based payments
The Group has applied the requirements of IFRS 2 “Share-based Payments” to all grants of equity instruments after 7 November 2002 that
were unvested at 1 July 2005.  
The Group issues equity-settled share-based payments to certain employees. Equity-settled share-based payments are measured at fair value
(excluding the effect of non market-based vesting conditions) at the date of grant. The fair value determined at the grant date of the equity-
settled share-based payments is expensed on a straight-line basis over the vesting period, based on the Group’s estimate of shares that will
eventually vest and adjusted for the effect of non market-based vesting conditions. Fair value is measured by use of the Black Scholes model.
The expected life used in the model has been adjusted, based on management’s best estimate, for the effects of non-transferability, exercise
restrictions, and behavioural considerations.  Prior to 15 May 2007 the Company’s shares were not listed on a stock exchange and therefore,
in the absence of a readily available market price for the shares, the share price was based on the market value agreed with HM Revenue &
Customs and share price volatility was estimated as the average of the volatility applying to a comparable group of listed companies.   Notes to the Financial Statements (continued)

BACK TO CONTENTS
2. Signiﬁcant accounting policies (continued)
Property, plant and equipment
Plant and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and any recognised impairment loss.  Depreciation is provided, where
material, on all tangible fixed assets at rates calculated to write off the cost or valuation, less estimated residual value, of each asset evenly
using a straight-line method over its estimated useful life as follows:
Fixtures, fittings, plant and equipment:
Leasehold property tenants’ fixtures over the life of the lease
Office equipment over 10 years
Computer equipment and software over 3 to 4 years
Motor vehicles: over 4 years
The carrying values of tangible fixed assets are reviewed for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying
value may not be recoverable.  The gain or loss arising on the disposal or retirement of an asset is determined as the difference between the
sales proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset and is recognised in income.
Leasing
Leases are classified as finance leases whenever the terms of the lease transfer substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership to the
lessee. All other leases are classified as operating leases.  Rentals payable under operating leases are charged to income on a straight-line
basis over the term of the relevant lease.  Benefits received and receivable as an incentive to enter into an operating lease are also spread on a
straight-line basis over the lease term.
Intangible assets excluding goodwill
Other intangible assets comprise computer software which is stated at cost less amortisation and any recognised impairment loss.
Amortisation is provided, where material, on all intangible fixed assets excluding goodwill at rates calculated to write off the cost or
valuation, less estimated residual value, of each asset evenly using a straight-line method over its estimated useful life as follows:
Computer software: over 3 to 4 years
The carrying values of computer software are reviewed for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying
value may not be recoverable.  The gain or loss arising on the disposal or retirement of an asset is determined as the difference between the
sales proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset and is recognised in income.
Website development design and content development costs are capitalised only to the extent that they lead to the creation of an enduring
asset, which delivers benefits at least as great as the amount capitalised.
Impairment of tangible and intangible assets excluding goodwill
At each balance sheet date, the Group reviews the carrying amounts of its tangible and intangible assets to determine whether there is any
indication that those assets have suffered an impairment loss. If any such indication exists, the recoverable amount of the asset is estimated
in order to determine the extent of the impairment loss (if any). Where the asset does not generate cash flows that are independent from other
assets, the Group estimates the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit to which the asset belongs. Recoverable amount is the higher
of fair value less costs to sell and value in use.  An intangible asset with an indefinite useful life is tested for impairment annually and
whenever there is an indication that the asset may be impaired.
If the recoverable amount of an asset is estimated to be less than its carrying amount, the carrying amount of the asset is reduced to its
recoverable amount. An impairment loss is recognised as an expense immediately, unless the relevant asset is carried at a revalued amount,
in which case the impairment loss is treated as a revaluation decrease.
Dividend recognition
Dividend distributions to the Company’s shareholders are recognised in the accounting period in which the dividends are declared and paid,
or if earlier, in the accounting period when the dividend is approved by the Company’s shareholders at the Annual General Meeting.
Financial instruments
Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognised in the Group’s balance sheet when the Group becomes a party to the contractual
provisions of the instrument.   Notes to the Financial Statements (continued)
Annual report and financial statements | Year ended 30 June 2010 46
BACK TO CONTENTS
2. Signiﬁcant accounting policies (continued)
Trade receivables
Trade receivables are measured at initial recognition at fair value. Appropriate allowances for estimated irrecoverable amounts are
recognised in profit or loss when there is objective evidence that the asset is impaired.  In accordance with market practice, certain balances
with clients, Stock Exchange member firms and other counterparties are included as debtors.
Investments
Investments are recognised and derecognised on a trade date where a purchase or sale of an investment is under a contract whose terms
require delivery of the investment within the timeframe established by the market concerned, and are initially measured at cost, including
transaction costs.
The Group’s available-for-sale investments have been included at fair value where a fair value can be reliably calculated, with the revaluation
gains and losses reflected in the investment revaluation reserve, as shown in the Consolidated Statement of Changes in Equity on page 38,
until sale when the cumulative gain or loss is transferred to the income statement.  If a fair value cannot be reliably calculated by reference to
a quoted market price or other method of valuation, available-for-sale investments are included at cost where the directors believe that cost is
not materially different to fair value, with a fair value adjustment recognised upon disposal of the investment. 
Investments which are designated as being held at fair value through profit or loss are carried at fair value, being the quoted market price of
the listed investment, with any gain or loss reported within the income statement.  An investment is classified in this category if it is held
principally for the purpose of selling in the short term.
Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash on hand and demand deposits, and other short-term highly liquid investments that are readily
convertible to a known amount of cash and are subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value.  Included within cash balances are
amounts held on client settlement accounts as shown in note 18.
Financial liabilities and equity
Financial liabilities and equity instruments are classified according to the substance of the contractual arrangements entered into. An equity
instrument is any contract that evidences a residual interest in the assets of the Group after deducting all of its liabilities.
Trade payables
Trade payables are measured at fair value which is equivalent to amortised cost.  In accordance with market practice, certain balances with
clients, Stock Exchange member firms and other counterparties are included as creditors.
3. Key sources of judgements and estimation uncertainty
The preparation of the financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of
revenues, expenses, assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent liabilities. If in the future such estimates and assumptions, which
are based on management’s best judgement at the date of preparation of the financial statements, deviate from actual circumstances, the
original estimates and assumptions will be modified as appropriate in the period in which the circumstances change. The areas where a
higher degree of judgement or complexity arise, or areas where assumptions and estimates are significant to the consolidated financial
statements, are discussed below.
Share-based payments
In determining the fair value of equity settled share-based awards and the related charge to the income statement, the Group makes
assumptions about the future events and market conditions.  In particular, judgement must be formed as to the likely number of shares that
will vest, and the fair value of each award granted.  The fair value is determined using a valuation model which is dependent on future
estimates, including the Group’s future dividend policy, the timing with which the options will be exercised and the future volatility in the
price of the Group’s shares.  Different assumptions about these factors to those made by the Group could materially affect the reported value
of share-based payments.
Indemnity provision
The indemnity provision represents management’s best estimate of the Group’s liability to policy lapses resulting in indemnity commission
claw-backs.  The calculation is based on the volume of indemnified commission and on past experience of policy cancellation. 
Staff costs
Included in staff costs is an estimate of the future liability for bonuses and other employee incentive schemes which have been earned but
not paid. Notes to the Financial Statements (continued)

4. Revenue
Revenue represents commission receivable from financial services provided to clients, interest on settlement accounts and management fees
charged to clients.  It relates to services provided in the UK and is stated net of value added tax.  An analysis of the Group’s revenue is as
follows:
Year ended Year ended

2010 2009
Revenue from services: £’000 £’000
Fees and commission income 135,738 99,578
Interest and similar income 20,521 31,142
Subscriptions and sundry charges 2,711 2,125
Total operating income 158,970 132,845
5. Segment information
In 2009, the Group adopted IFRS 8 “Operating Segments”.  The impact of this accounting standard is purely presentational.
At 30 June 2010, the Group is organised into three business segments, namely the Vantage Division, the Discretionary Division and the Third
Party/Other Services Division. This is based upon the Group’s internal organisation and management structure and is the primary way in
which the Chief Operating Decision Maker (CODM) is provided with financial information. The CODM has been identified as the Board of
Executive Directors.
The ‘Vantage’ division represents all activities relating to the Vantage service, our direct-to-private investor platform. 
The ‘Discretionary’ division is focused on the provision of managed services such as our Portfolio Management Service (PMS) and range of
Multi-Manager funds.  
The ‘Third Party/Other Services’ division includes activities relating to the broking of third party investments and pensions, certificated share
dealing and other niche services such as currency, CFD’s and spread betting.  In this division, clients’ investments are not administered
within the Group.
The ‘Group’ segment contains items that are shared by the Group as a whole and cannot be reasonably allocated to other operating segments.
Segment expenses are those that are directly attributable to a segment together with the relevant portion of other expenses that can
reasonably be allocated to the segment. Gains or losses on the disposal of available-for-sale investments, investment income, interest payable
and tax are not allocated by segment. 
Segment assets and liabilities include items that are directly attributable to a segment plus an allocation on a reasonable basis of shared
items.  Corporate assets and liabilities are not included in business segments and are thus unallocated.  At 30 June 2010 and 2009, these
comprise cash and cash equivalents, short term investments, tax-related and other assets or liabilities.  
Consolidation adjustments relate to the elimination of inter-segment revenues, balances and investments in group subsidiaries required on
consolidation. Notes to the Financial Statements (continued)

Information about products/services
The group’s operating segments are business units that provide different products and services.  The breakdown of revenue from external
customers for each type of service is therefore the same as the segmental analysis above.
Information about geographical area
All business activities are located within the UK.
Information about major customers
The group does not rely on any individual customer. Notes to the Financial Statements (continued)

market generally for employees of comparable status, responsibility and skills. All employees are eligible to be considered for an annual
discretionary bonus. In addition to cash bonuses, the Group operates various share-based remuneration schemes as described in note 25.

Corporation tax is calculated at 28% of the estimated assessable profit for the year to 30 June 2010.
In addition to the amount charged to the income statement, certain tax amounts have been charged or credited directly to equity as follows:
£’000 £’000
Deferred tax relating to share-based payments (1,104) 1,821
Current tax relief on exercise of share options - (2,329)
Current tax on gain on disposal of shares held by EBT (965) -
(2,069) (508)
Factors affecting tax charge for the year
It is expected that the ongoing effective tax rate will trend to a rate approximating to the standard UK corporation tax rate in the medium
term.  The Finance (No 2) Act received Royal Assent on 27 July 2010 reduces the standard UK corporation tax rate to 27% (from 28%) on 1
April 2011.  Deferred tax has been recognised at 28%, being the rate in force at balance sheet date.    A deferred tax asset in respect of future
share option deductions has been recognised based on the Company’s share price as at 30 June 2010.  
Factors affecting future tax charge
Any increase or decrease to the Company’s share price will impact the amount of tax deduction available in future years on the value of
shares acquired by staff under share incentive schemes.  
The charge for the year can be reconciled to the profit per the income statement as follows:

12. Earnings per share
Basic earnings per share is calculated by dividing the profit attributable to equity holders of the Company by the weighted average number of
ordinary shares in issue during the period, including ordinary shares held in the EBT reserve which have vested unconditionally with
employees. 
Diluted earnings per share is calculated adjusting the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding to assume conversion of all
dilutive potential ordinary shares.  
Adjusted basic earnings per share and adjusted diluted earnings per share are calculated as for basic and diluted earnings per share, but
using an adjusted earnings figure such that the profit attributable to equity holders of the Company is stated before investment gains and
before one-off costs relating to the new office. The directors consider that the adjusted earnings per share represent a more consistent
measure of underlying performance.  Notes to the Financial Statements (continued)

The net carrying value of goodwill relates entirely to the acquisition of Hargreaves Lansdown Pensions Direct Limited.  The Group tests
goodwill annually for impairment or more frequently if there are indications that goodwill might be impaired. The recoverable amount of
goodwill is determined from value in use calculations. The key assumptions for the value in use calculations are those regarding the discount
rates and growth rates during the period.  The Group prepares cash flow forecasts derived from the most recent financial forecasts covering
the period to 30 June 2012 approved by management extrapolated based on an estimated long term industry growth rate of 3%.
Management estimates discount rates using pre-tax rates that reflect current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks
specific to this subsidiary. The pre-tax rate used to discount the forecast cash flows is 9.8%. Notes to the Financial Statements (continued)

25. Share-based payments 
Equity-settled share option scheme
The Group seeks to facilitate significant equity ownership by employees, principally through schemes which encourage and assist the
purchase of the Company’s shares.  
The Group operates four share option plans: the Employee Savings-Related Share Option Scheme (“SAYE”), the Hargreaves Lansdown plc
Share Incentive Plan (“SIP”),  the Hargreaves Lansdown Company Share Option Scheme (the “Executive Option Scheme") and the Hargreaves
Lansdown Joint Share Ownership Plan (“JSOP”).
Awards granted under the Employee SAYE scheme vest over five years. Awards granted under the Employee Share Incentive Plan vest over a
three-year period.  Awards granted under the Executive Option Scheme vest between nil and ten years.  Options are exercisable at a price
equal to the market value of the Company’s shares on the date of grant.  There are currently no performance conditions attached to any
options granted under any of the schemes, although options are forfeited (in most circumstances) if the employee leaves the Group before the
options vest.  
Interests in shares purchased under the JSOP were settled at under market value, with tax and National Insurance being paid on the
difference.  The shares must be held for a minimum of three years under the terms of the Deeds and are realisable in only very limited
circumstances before that date.  There are no performance conditions attached to the shares.
The recognition and measurement principles in IFRS 2 have been applied to all grants after 7 November 2002 which had not vested by 1 July
2005. They have not been applied to any grants made prior to 7 November 2002.

Prior to 15 May 2007 the Company’s shares were not listed on a stock exchange and therefore no readily available market price existed for
the shares.  The share price of share option awards granted prior to 15 May 2007 were based on the latest market value agreed with HM
Revenue & Customs using an earnings multiples approach based on comparable quoted companies.  Similarly, share price volatility was
estimated as the average of the volatility experienced by a comparable group of quoted companies.  The expected life used in the model has
been adjusted, based on management’s best estimate, for the effects of non-transferability, exercise restrictions, and behavioural
considerations.  Since 15 May 2007, a quoted market price has been available for the Company’s shares. 
The Group recognised total expenses related to equity-settled share-based payment transactions as shown in note 7.

Dividend
On 1 September 2010 the Directors proposed a second interim (final) ordinary dividend payment of 0.58 pence per ordinary share and a
special dividend of 1.7 pence per ordinary share, payable on 29 September 2010 to all shareholders on the register at the close of business
on 10 September as detailed in note 11. 
27. Related Party Transactions
The Group has a related party relationship with its subsidiaries, and with its directors and members of the Executive Committee (the “key
management personnel”). Transactions between the Group and its key management personnel are disclosed below.  Details of transactions
between the Group and other related parties are also disclosed below.      
Trading transactions
The Group entered into the following transactions with directors and related parties who are not members of the Group:
During the years ending 30 June 2010 and 30 June 2009 the Group has been party to a lease with P K Hargreaves and S P Lansdown, who are
both directors of the Company, for the rental of the old head office premises at Kendal House at an annual rental of £302,400.  No amount
was outstanding at any year end.
Following the move to the new office in February 2010, notice was given to terminate the lease on Kendal House. As part of the termination
from that lease, an exit fee of £150,000 is to be paid and approximately £225,000 will be paid in dilapidation costs. Both amounts will
ultimately go to P K Hargreaves and S P Lansdown. As at 30 June 2010, both amounts had been accrued for in the group accounts but had
not yet been paid.
During the years ending 30 June 2010 and 30 June 2009 the Group has provided a range of investment services to shareholders, directors
and staff on normal third party business terms. Notes to the Financial Statements (continued)

28. Financial instruments
Fair value
The fair values of the Group’s financial assets and liabilities are not materially different from their carrying values.  Market values have been
used to determine the fair values of cash and cash equivalents, and available-for-sale financial assets where there is a quoted market price.
Investments in equity instruments which do not have a quoted market price in an active market or whose fair value cannot be reliably
measured are measured at cost which the directors believe is not significantly different to fair value.  
Fair value hierarchy
In the current financial year, the Group has adopted the amendment to IFRS 7 “Improving Disclosures about Financial Instruments”.  
No comparative disclosures are provided as they are not required in the first year of application.
The following table provides an analysis of financial instruments that are measured subsequent to initial recognition at fair value, grouped
into Levels 1 to 3 based on the degree to which fair value is observable:
Level 1 - Fair value measured using unadjusted quoted market prices
Level 2 - Fair value measured using inputs derived from observable market data
Level 3 - Fair value measured using valuation techniques that include inputs that are not based on observable market data

There were no transfers between Level 1 and Level 2 during the year.
Nature and extent of risks arising from financial instruments
(a) Financial risk management
Financial assets principally comprise trade and other receivables, cash and cash equivalents, and current asset listed and unlisted
investments.  Financial liabilities comprise certain provisions and trade and other payables. The main risks arising from financial
instruments are market risk (including interest rate risk, foreign exchange risk and price risk), liquidity risk, and credit risk. Each of these
risks is discussed in detail below. 
The Group monitors financial risks on a consolidated basis.  Hargreaves Lansdown’s financial risk management is based upon sound
economic objectives and good corporate practice.  No hedging transactions have taken place during the years presented.  The Group has
designed a framework to manage the risks of its business and to ensure that the Directors have in place risk management practices
appropriate to a listed company. The management of risk within the Group is governed by the Board.  Notes to the Financial Statements (continued)

BACK TO CONTENTS
28. Financial instruments (continued)
(b) Market risk
Interest rate risk
Interest rate risk is the risk that the Group will sustain losses from adverse movements in interest bearing assets.  There is an exposure to
interest rates on banking deposits held in the ordinary course of business.  At 30 June 2010 the value of financial instruments on the Group
balance sheet exposed to interest rate risk was £71,245,000 (2009: £87,416,000) comprising cash and cash equivalents.  A 100bps (1%)
move in interest rates, in isolation, would not have a material impact on the Group balance sheet or results.  This exposure is continually
monitored to ensure that the Group is maximising its interest earning potential within accepted liquidity and credit constraints. The Group
has no external borrowings and as such is not exposed to interest rate or refinancing risk on borrowings.  Cash at bank earns interest at
floating rates based on daily bank deposit rates.  Short term deposits are also made for varying periods of between one day and 12 months
depending on the immediate cash requirements of the Group and earn interest at the respective fixed term deposit rates.  As a source of
revenue is based on the value of client cash under administration, the Group has an indirect exposure to interest rate risk on cash balances
held for clients. These balances are not on the Group balance sheet. 
Foreign exchange translation and transaction risk
Foreign currency risk is the risk that the Group will sustain losses through adverse movements in currency exchange rates.  With substantially
all of the Group's businesses located within the UK, and therefore with minimal net assets and transactions of the Group denominated in
foreign currencies, the Group is not exposed to significant foreign exchange translation or transaction risk and as such does not hedge any
foreign current assets or liabilities.  The Group deals in foreign currencies on a matched basis on behalf of clients, limiting foreign exchange
exposure.  
Price risk
Price risk is the risk that a decline in the value of assets adversely impacts on the profitability of the Group as a result of an asset not meeting
its expected value.  
The Group is exposed to price risk on corporate investments held on the Group balance sheet.  At 30 June 2010, the fair value of investments
recognised on the Group balance sheet was £2,322,000 (2009: £2,382,000).  A 20% move in equity prices, in isolation, would not have a
material impact on the Group balance sheet or results. 
As a main source of revenue is based on the value of client assets under administration, the Group has an indirect exposure to security price
risk on investments held for clients. These assets are not on the Group balance sheet.  The risk of lower revenues is partially mitigated by
asset class diversification.  The Group does not hedge its revenue exposure to movements in the value of client assets arising from these risks,
and so the interests of the Group are aligned to those of its clients.
In addition, the Group acts as a private client investment manager, unit trust manager and agency stockbroker on a matched basis so its
exposure to market price movements in this capacity is limited to when there is a trade mismatch or error, or if one matched counterparty
fails to fulfil its obligations.  The impact of these risks is minimised by limits and monitoring controls.
(c) Liquidity risk
The Group is exposed to liquidity risk, namely, the risk that it may be unable to meet its payment obligations as they fall due.  The Group is
highly cash generative and holds significant liquid assets.  The Group actively maintains cash balances on short term deposit to ensure that
the Group has sufficient available funds for operations.   Notes to the Financial Statements (continued)

Total financial liability exposed to liquidity risk 80,797 4,628 327 21 85,773
(d) Credit risk
The Group has no significant concentration of credit risk as credit exposure is spread over a large number of counterparties and customers.  
Within the Group’s Stockbroking operation, the Group is exposed to credit risk from counterparties to a securities transaction during the
period between the trade date and the settlement date. This period is generally three business days. The Group has credit exposure that
extends beyond the original settlement date if the counterparty fails either to make payment or to deliver securities. These transactions are
with financial institutions and clients.  Settlement risk is substantially mitigated as a result of the delivery versus payment mechanism
whereby if a counterparty fails to make payment, the securities would not be delivered to the counterparty. In that instance, the securities
could be sold in the market and therefore the economic substance of the transaction is that securities serve as collateral in the case of
delivery versus payment trade debtors. As a result, the risk exposure is effectively to an adverse movement in market prices between the time
of trade and settlement.  
Other credit risk within the Group is primarily attributable to its trade receivables and the majority represents balances due from other
regulated financial institutions where there is an ongoing relationship between the Group and institution. Credit risk is therefore considered
to be limited.  The amounts presented in the balance sheet are net of allowances for doubtful receivables. An allowance for impairment is
made where there is an identified loss event which, based on previous experience, is evidence of a reduction in the recoverability of the cash
flows.
Cash is held with UK banks. The credit risk on liquid funds is limited because the counterparties are banks with high credit-ratings assigned
by international credit-rating agencies and since November 2008 the banks consist of certain eligible banks under the UK Government Credit
Guarantee Scheme. The Group takes a conservative approach to treasury management and selection of banking counterparties, and carries
out a regular review of all its banks’ and custodians’ credit ratings.     Notes to the Financial Statements (continued)

Capital management
Capital is defined as the total of share capital, share premium, retained earnings and other reserves. Total capital at 30 June 2010 was
£66,053,000 (2009: £84,650,000) and this capital is managed via the net assets to which it relates.  
Regulatory capital is determined in accordance with the requirements of the Capital Requirements Directive prescribed in the UK by the
Financial Services Authority (“FSA”), and the Group’s regulatory capital is divided into two tiers:
- Tier 1 capital, which is the total of issued share capital, retained earnings and reserves created by appropriations of retained earnings, net
of the book value of goodwill and other intangible assets; and 
- Tier 2 capital, which is unrealised gains arising on the fair valuation of equity instruments held as available-for-sale.
The Group’s objectives when managing capital are i) to comply with the regulatory capital requirements set by the FSA; ii) to safeguard the
Group’s ability to continue as a going concern so that it can continue to provide returns for shareholders and benefits for other stakeholders;
and iii) to maintain a strong capital base to support the development of its business.
All regulated entities within the Group are required to meet the Pillar 1 regulatory Capital Resources Requirements (CRR) set out in the
Capital Requirements Directive (the “Directive”).  The CRR is the higher of i) the fixed overhead requirement and ii) the sum of the credit risk
capital requirement and the market risk capital requirement. 
The Group is also required to comply with the requirements of the Directive under Pillar 2 (Operational Risk) and Pillar 3 (Disclosure) in
respect of the Group’s regulatory capital requirements. The Directive requires continual assessment of the Group’s risks in order to ensure
that the higher of Pillar 1 and 2 requirements is met, the objective being to ensure that the regulated firms have adequate capital to enable
them to manage their risks. The Group completes its assessment of regulatory capital requirements using its Individual Capital Adequacy
Assessment Process (“ICAAP”) under Pillar 2, which is a forward looking exercise that includes stress testing on major risks, such as a
significant market downturn, and identifying mitigating action. The ICAAP covers current as well as projected capital requirements, and is
used to manage regulatory capital. Under the requirements of Pillar 3, the Group is required to disclose regulatory capital information, and
has done so by making the disclosures available in the Group’s website at http://www.h-l.co.uk/investor-relations/pillar-3-disclosures.
All of the regulated firms maintained surplus regulated capital throughout the year.  The aggregated regulatory Pillar 1 capital surplus across
the four regulated subsidiaries was approximately £42 million at 30 June 2010 (2009: £34 million). Capital adequacy and the use of
regulatory capital are monitored by the Group’s management.  Directors, Company Secretary, Advisors and Shareholder Information

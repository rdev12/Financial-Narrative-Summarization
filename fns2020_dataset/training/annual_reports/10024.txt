Chairman’s statement
Keith Henry
Chairman
the project received a positive ruling 
from the Commission charged by the 
Ministry of Environment with ruling on 
the Ombrina Mare oil and gas field 
development EIA. We look forward to 
progressing the development of this 
cornerstone asset over the next few 
years.
A second important development was 
the completion of the sale in February 
2013 of 75% of MOG’s wholly owned 
subsidiary Phoenicia Energy Company 
Limited (‘PECL’) to Genel Energy plc 
(‘Genel’). PECL owns the exploration 
and production rights to Area 4 
offshore Malta. MOG was able to 
secure a consideration that returned 
$10 million of prior years’ costs, 
together with a 100% carry of the cost 
for the first exploration well planned to 
be drilled in Q4 2013, plus a 100% carry 
of the cost for the second exploration 
well up to a maximum of US$30 million 
gross expenditure.
Dear Shareholder,
Mediterranean Oil & Gas Plc (‘MOG’, 
the ‘Group’ or the ‘Company’) is 
pleased to announce the Company’s 
2012 results.
After more than a year with the 
Company I am pleased to be able to 
report on behalf of the Board the 
continuation of the transformation of 
the Company that was started in 2011.
A key development for 2012 was the 
introduction of a new law in Italy that 
provides an exemption for the 
Ombrina Mare development from the 
offshore ban to all new exploration 
and production activity that was 
introduced in 2010 after the Macondo 
incident in the Gulf of Mexico. This 
exemption has enabled the Company 
to seek the approval of the 
Environmental Impact Assessment 
(EIA) submitted in 2009. We are 
currently in the final stages of that 
approval, having recently heard that 
‘ We have continued the 
transformation of the 
Company started in 
201 1 and we are 
building on our abilities 
to advance the value 
of our portfolio in the 
year ahead.’ Business Review Corporate Governance Financial Statements
Mediterranean Oil & Gas Plc / Annual Report & Accounts 2012 7
Production for the year was 
underpinned by the Guendalina field, 
which produced in-line with our 
expectations, averaging net to MOG 
4.1 million scf/d (116,000 scm/d) and 
accounted for 84% of total net 
production. The field reserves were 
re-certified post the reporting period in 
line with the previous year’s report. As  
a result of the strong revenues from 
Guendalina and our onshore Italy 
assets, the Company has continued to 
strengthen its net assets, which will 
help us to achieve our key commercial 
objectives and growth strategy going 
forwards.
Cash and cash equivalents at the 
period end was €8.7 million, which has 
since been strengthened through the 
receipt of cash equivalent to €7.7 
million from completion of the Genel 
transaction post period end. Net 
cashflow from operations in 2012 were 
€6.5 million, up from €1.1 million in 2011, 
more than covering operating 
expenses.
During 2012 a number of changes 
were made to the membership of the 
Board and the Executive Management 
Team. Jake Ulrich and I joined the 
Company in January 2012 as Non-
Executive Directors, and Dr William ‘Bill’ 
Higgs joined as MOG’s Chief Executive 
in March. During the year Miles 
Donnelly, Michael Seymour and 
Salvatore Russo stepped down from 
the Board and I am very grateful to 
them for their support, particularly to 
Salvatore Russo who had served as a 
Director since the formation of the 
Company in 2005. Chicco Testa and 
Dr Peter Jackson joined the Board in 
October 2012 and in January 2013 
respectively. I am confident we have a 
Board of Directors that is well placed to 
guide the Company through its next 
phase of development.
Outlook
There is no doubt that 2013 will be 
another important year in the growth 
of the Company. During the period we 
expect to receive the approval of the 
EIA and the award of the Production 
Concession for Ombrina Mare, thereby 
enabling the Company to drill a pilot 
appraisal well in early 2014, targeting 
the transformation of 2P reserves into 
1P reserves and contingent resources 
into reserves. We will also continue with 
the preparations to drill the first Hagar 
Qim exploration well offshore Malta, 
which, with our partner Genel, we plan 
to spud before the end of the year.
MOG continues to build up a very 
experienced technical and 
management team highly capable of 
exploring and developing oil and gas 
assets. To that end the Board remains 
focused and committed to growing 
the Company and we are actively 
seeking additional opportunities to 
expand our current portfolio.
On behalf of the Board, I would like 
thank our shareholders and employees 
for their continued support of the 
Company.

Chief Executive’s report
William Higgs
Chief Executive
The Company has a broad asset base 
across the exploration, development 
and production phases of the 
business. These assets have significant 
upside potential and we now have the 
financial strength to de-risk and 
mature these assets over the coming 
years, while also looking for valuable 
opportunities for asset acquisition.
Gas Production and Prices
All gas production of the Group 
currently occurs in Italy.
In 2012, total gas production was  
1.8 Bcf, which represented a 200% 
increase relative to the prior year  
(2011: 0.6 Bcf). This was largely due  
to a full year of gas production at the 
Guendalina gas field, which 
accounted for 84% of total production 
for the Group.
During 2012, the Brent oil price has 
fluctuated around $111/bbl, while the 
Euro vs US Dollar exchange rate has 
experienced significant volatility  
which has influenced gas prices. The 
average gas sales price achieved by 
the Group during the period, excluding 
production from discontinued 
operations, was €0.33/scm ($12.0 per 
thousand cubic feet).
The year 2012 has set the foundation 
for growth as we achieved strong 
financial, commercial and 
operational performance.
A full year of production from 
Guendalina combined with 
continued production onshore Italy 
delivered total sales revenue for the 
Group of €16.3 million and a cash 
and cash equivalent position of €8.7 
million at 31 December 2012.
The two critical commercial 
objectives for the year were 
achieved. Firstly, our Ombrina Mare 
field was included in an exemption 
from the offshore drilling ban 
introduced in 2010 in Italy. Secondly, 
we were able to secure a new partner 
to fund exploration drilling activities at 
Malta offshore Area 4. The Group is 
now in a strong financial and 
operational position, which will 
enable MOG to actively seek 
strategic growth opportunities while 
progressing its portfolio of production, 
development and exploration assets.
Building 
a resources 
factory
‘ For the first time in our 
history we achieved a 
profit from operations 
and set the foundation 
for growth’
The Company’s forecasts for future gas 
prices indicate that the positive trend 
seen in the last two years is not 
expected to continue in 2013 and 2014 
and the Italian gas price is expected to 
progressively decline by approximately 
2 to 4 Euro cents per scm, due to the 
excess of gas supply relative to gas 
demand.
Oil & Gas Reserves and Resources
The Group’s reserves and resources 
are reviewed on an annual basis  
by independent certifiers (Proven, 
Probable and Possible Reserves)  
and/or by the Company (Contingent 
and Prospective Resources). As at  
31 December 2012, the Company 
recorded 2P reserves of 40 MMbbls oil 
(net) and 15.3 Bcf (net) of gas. Best 
estimate contingent resources were  
17 MMbbls oil (net) and 22.3 Bcf (net) 
of gas. Business Review Corporate Governance Financial Statements

The Guendalina gas field is located 
47km offshore of the north-east coast 
of Italy, in 42m of water. Mediterranean Oil & Gas Plc / Annual Report & Accounts 2012 10
Chief Executive’s report continued
Development activity for these fields 
was frozen from 2001, initially pending 
the resolution of environmental 
concerns about subsidence caused 
by developing the offshore region.  
The Italian Government indicated in 
2009 that it is in favour of a positive 
resolution of these issues in this area of 
the Northern Adriatic. As a portion of 
the Company’s AC19 PI concession lies 
within 12 miles of nature reserves it was 
impacted by the 2010 offshore 
restrictions introduced by the Italian 
Government for the offshore E&P 
activities. On 7 August 2012 the Italian 
Parliament issued the Law 134/2012 
containing Article 35, which relates to 
offshore exploration and production 
activities. The Article states that the 
restrictions introduced under Decree 
DLGS 128/2010 would no longer be 
applicable for the pre-existing offshore 
E&P activities such as concession AC19 
PI. The Company can now work with 
ENI to increase the priority of the 
development of the Northern Adriatic 
discoveries within AC19 PI.
Italy – Onshore Foredeep Gas
In Italy, the Company has a large 
number of onshore production and 
exploration gas assets that target  
gas traps in the Pliocene aged sand 
deposits of the Apennines foredeep.  
In this E&P acreage the existing 
production is not the only value. In fact, 
several interesting development and 
exploration projects are also present, 
mainly within existing production 
Guendalina has produced in line 
with management expectations for 
the year under review. Recertification 
of the reserves demonstrates that the 
asset has the capability to provide 
revenues for at least the next 3 to 5 
years. Additional opportunities to 
add production at Guendalina 
come from our ability to open up an 
additional completed production 
zone in well Gue 3 and a side track 
of one of the producing wells into a 
deeper target once Gue-2 reaches 
its economic limit.
Other North Adriatic Gas Discoveries 
(MOG WI 15%, ENI WI 85% and 
Operator)
The Guendalina project is located in 
one of the most important gas 
exploration and production areas in 
Italy and is situated 70km to the south 
of four other discovered, but still 
undeveloped, offshore gas fields in 
which the Group has a 15% interest.
These four gas discoveries amount  
to between 19 to 48 Bcf net 
contingent gas resources to the 
Group and represent an important 
growth opportunity for the Company. 
Their reclassification from 2C 
(Contingent Resources) to 2P 
reserves is expected to take place 
following authorisation of the 
development plans for the fields.
concessions that have the potential to 
unlock approximately 12 to 14 Bcf net

Group and achieve new near to 
mid-term gas production.

Under the terms of the Sale and 
Purchase Agreement, on Completion:
 > CIL will pay to MOG the sum of €100 
as consideration for the acquisition 
of the Company’s working interests 
held in the Assets; 
 > CIL agrees to assume the liability for 
all future plug, abandonment and 
site remediation costs associated 
with the Assets; 
 > MOG will pay €1,250,000 to CIL as  
a partial contribution towards the 
future plug, abandonment and site 
remediation costs for the Assets; 
 > MOG will credit CIL the revenue 
MOG received from the Assets 
during the period between the 
Effective Date of 24 August 2012 and 
the Completion Date (the ‘Interim 
Period’), net of allowable operating 
costs and agreed capital 
expenditure associated with the 
Assets and incurred by MOG during 
the Interim Period. 
During the coming year we will 
continue to progress our exploration 
activities with the drilling of one well 
and final preparations and approvals 
of two additional wells planned for 
drilling in 2014.
In December 2012, we received the 
award of the Aglavizza Production 
Concession onshore central Italy 
where we have a 100% interest in the 
7km
2
 concession that includes the 
Civita 1 discovery with estimated 
proved and probable reserves of more 
than 1 Bcf. Post the award, we safely 
conducted a production test of Civita 
1 that confirmed excellent 
permeability and no near-well bore 
formation damage. We estimate that 
the Aglavizza field can be profitably 
developed, with first gas due in  
early 2015.
Italy – Ombrina Mare
Oil & Gas Discovery (MOG WI 100%)
The Ombrina Mare discovery is an 
important asset for the Company that 
represents an important future growth 
opportunity.
Following the successful drilling of two 
exploration/appraisal wells in 2008, the 
completion of a well as an oil producer 
and the set- up of a tripod platform in 
preparation for the development 
phase, the Company applied for a 
production Concession (d 30 B.C-MD) 
in December 2008. The Company 
obtained in early 2010, an 
independent certification of 40 
MMbbls 2P oil reserves, of which 
proven (P1) oil reserves were just over 
12 MMbbls. These oil reserves establish 
the Ombrina Mare field as a significant 
European oil project.
During the period:
 > Law 35/2012, regarding 
‘simplifications and economic 
growth’ was ratified on 6 April 2012 
clarifying that the limitations 
provided by Decree 128 do not 
apply to either existing mining titles 
or ‘relevant extensions’. 
 > We received a three year extension 
to our exploration permit BR269 GC, 
where the Ombrina Mare field is 
located, in May.
 > Law number 134/2012 was 
published on 11 August 2012 
confirming that restrictions under 
decree DLGS 128/2010 will no longer 
apply to: 
i) applications for production 
concessions that were under 
review at the time DLGS 128/2010 
came into force, and any 
connected or subsequent 
proceedings; 
ii) any titles, including exploration 
licences, that had already been 
issued prior to DLGS 128/2010 
coming into force; and 
iii) any proceedings connected with 
or subsequent to such titles, 
including possible extensions of 
the same. 
 > We re-engaged with the Ministry of 
Environment to seek approval of the 
EIA submitted as part of the 
Concession application in 2008.

Chief Executive’s report continued
Malta – Offshore Area 4
The Group operates Offshore Area 4, 
which comprises 5,700km
2
 of deep 
water acreage north of the 
internationally recognised border 
between Malta and Libya.
During the period:
 > We acquired a 10% interest in the 
Licence from Leni Gas and Oil 
Investments Ltd. 
 > ERC Equipoise (‘ERCE’) completed a 
Competent Persons Report on Malta 
offshore Area 4, validating the 
economic potential of Eocene 
Prospects within the Licence. 
 > We received approval from the 
Maltese Government of a one year 
extension to the first exploration 
period to 18 January 2014. 
 > We completed key documents for 
the sale of a 75% interest in Malta 
offshore Area 4 to Genel for a 
consideration of: 
 > US$10 million cash payment 
(received in February 2013); 
 > 100% carry on the first exploration 
well, and a 100% carry on the 
second exploration well up to 
US$30 million gross expenditure; 
 > At MOG’s option, should the costs 
of the second well exceed US$30 
million, Genel will provide a 
financing arrangement to fund 
MOG’s 25% share of any 
additional expenditure, at an 
interest rate equivalent to 3 
Month Libor plus 400 bps. 
 > MOG will remain operator adviser 
to PECL until completion of the 
first exploration well, at which 
time Genel can elect to become 
the operator, or at such later date 
as the parties may agree.
The Company is continuing its active 
dialogue with the Italian Government, 
with a view to securing approval of 
the EIA for Ombrina Mare and the 
award of the associated Production 
Concession. We currently expect the 
Production Concession will be 
awarded during the third quarter of 
2013. Post award, we will progress the 
drilling of a pilot appraisal well to 
evaluate additional potential in the 
deeper Cretaceous reservoir and to 
set a second production well. This 
activity should enable the most 
flexibility in funding the future 
development of Ombrina Mare.
Wildcat Exploration
Italy – Southern Apennines
In the Southern Apennines, the Group 
operates the Monte Grosso project, 
holding a 22.89% interest. The project 
is a high quality near field exploration 
opportunity close to one of the 
largest onshore oil producing areas 
in Western Europe. The Monte Grosso 
exploration project presently remains 
on hold, pending resolution of 
residual permitting issues, which the 
Group presently believes should be 
positively resolved and allow a 
project start-up in late 2015 (subject 
to rig availability). The Monte Grosso 2 
well is targeting 280 MMbbls of 
unrisked prospective resources (64 
MMbbls net to the Group) at a depth 
of 6,500m. Permitting and existing 
well site maintenance works were the 
main activities conducted during the 
period.
The area is frontier exploration where 
no drilling activity has occurred and it 
is one of the rare areas that still 
remains to be explored in the 
Mediterranean basin. The transaction 
with Genel means that a minimum of 
two exploration wells are now fully 
funded. We expect that the first well will 
be drilled in late 2013 with the second 
to follow within 18 months.
Offshore Area 4 is a high risk, but 
potentially a high reward, geological 
environment where nine prospects 
and leads have been certified by ERCE 
and RPS with a total of 325 million bbls 
of unrisked prospective oil resources 
net to MOG.
France – St Laurent
The St Laurent permit is located in 
southern France in a known gas and 
oil prone province. The Company has 
an 11% WI in this asset. There has been 
little activity on the permit in 2012. The 
joint venture partners have undergone 
some changes with Nautical Petroleum 
plc being acquired by Cairn Energy 
plc and Aquitaine Exploration Ltd 
acquiring an 18.2% interest in the 
licence from Egdon Resources. The 
strategy for the licence is currently 
being finalised by the joint venture 
partners.
Health, Safety and the Environment 
The Company continues to be 
committed to maintaining the highest 
standards in HSE management. No 
environmental incidents have been 
reported for the period under review. 
However, we had one lost time injury 
when one of our employees sustained 
a head injury while inspecting the 
Ombrina Mare tripod. A full route 
cause analysis was conducted and 
the inspection SOP updated. Business Review Corporate Governance Financial Statements

Operational Overview
MOG has a broad portfolio of 
production, development and 
exploration assets and a secure 
financial position. Revenues from gas 
sales are now providing a sound 
financial position going forward.
Over the next 12 months, MOG intends 
to progress its key assets and pursue 
attractive and material strategic 
growth opportunities that we expect to 
identify.
One of the strengths of the Company is 
the wide international experience of its 
senior managers, in particular in the 
Mediterranean area and the 
operational capability of its staff and 
organisation. We have added some 
key members of staff in 2012 and we 
believe that the capability of our 
organisation is a key strength for the 
ambitious growth objectives of the 
Group.

Financial review
Chris Kelsall
Finance Director
In addition, the Group’s interest in 
Phoenicia Energy Company Limited 
(“PECL”) is disclosed as an asset held 
for sale in the statement of financial 
position in accordance with the 
provisions of IFRS 5 (refer Note 6(a) for 
further information). However, as the 
Group is retaining an interest in PECL 
following the completion of the 
transaction with Genel Energy plc, this 
is not considered to be a discontinued 
operation and therefore the results of 
PECL are recorded within the Group 
statement of comprehensive income, 
as continuing operations.
Revenue
Excluding discontinued activities, as 
noted above, gas and gas 
condensate production of 47.7 MM 
scm (1.69 Bcf), together with 
operatorship income, resulted in a 
249% increase in revenues to €16.3m 
(2011: €4.7m). A substantial increase in 
gas production excluding 
discontinued activities, relative to the 
prior 12 month period (2011: 17.6 MM 
scm; 0.62 Bcf), was primarily 
attributable to the full year effect of 
gas production at the Guendalina 
offshore gas field, which commenced 
in late October 2011. 
Excluding production from 
discontinued activities, the Group’s 
average realised gas sales price in 
2012 was €0.33/scm (USD 12.0/Mcf). A 
new gas sales contract for Guendalina 
was signed in April 2012 with Repower 
Italia SpA (“Repower Italia”), covering 
the thermal year ending 1 October 
2013. In March 2013, we were pleased 
to announce a further extension of the 
contract with Repower Italia to cover 
the subsequent thermal year ending  
1 October 2014.
Income From Operations
Profit from operations in 2012 was €4.1m 
(2011: loss of €1.8m). The increase was 
primarily attributable to an increase in 
2012 revenues which significantly 
outpaced the combined effect of an 
increase in the cost of sales to €3.8m 
(2011: €1.0m) and an increase in total 
administrative expenses (including 
depreciation) to €8.5m (2011: €5.7m). 
The increase in total administrative 
expenses arose primarily from an 
elevated depreciation expense of 
€4.5m (2011: €1.4m), attributable 
largely to the Guendalina field going 
into full production. This was partly 
offset by a lower impairment expense 
of €Nil in the year (2011: €1.1m), 
excluding assets held for sale to CIL.
Profit before tax from continuing 
operations was €3.6m (2011: €2.9m). 
The 2011 result was significantly 
increased by a one off finance gain 
2012 highlights
 > Cash and cash equivalents at 
year-end €8.7m (2011: €3.7m) 
 > Group revenue from sales of gas

Presentation of 2012 Financial 
Statements
On 6 September 2012, the Group 
announced the divestment of non-
core exploration and production gas 
assets onshore Italy, which belong to 
the subsidiaries Medoilgas Italia SpA 
and Medoilgas Civita Limited, to 
Canoel International Energy Limited 
(“CIL”). The assets are presented in the 
Consolidated Statement of Financial 
Position as non-current assets “held for 
sale” in accordance with IFRS 5 
Non-current assets held for sale and 
discontinued operations (refer Note 
6(b) for further information) and in the 
income statements as discontinued 
operations.  Business Review Corporate Governance Financial Statements
Mediterranean Oil & Gas Plc / Annual Report & Accounts 2012 15
of €5.7m arising on the settlement of 
financial liabilities, as part of the 
Group’s recapitalization undertaken  
in May 2011. Profits after tax from 
continuing operations were €1.8m 
(2011: €6.5m). The elevated 2011 result 
was also influenced by the recognition 
of a €3.7m deferred tax asset 
associated with tax losses brought 
forward (following commencement of 
production at Guendalina) and timing 
differences.
The basic and diluted earnings per 
share on continuing operations was 
0.41 cents per share (2011: earnings of 
2 cents per share). No dividend is 
proposed to be paid for the year 
ended 31 December 2012 (2011: €nil).
Cash Flow
Net Group cash flow generated from 
operating activities was €6.5m (2011: 
€1.1m), which reflects the significant 
increase in production achieved in  
the year at the Guendalina field, 
relative to 2011.
Following completion of capital 
expenditure associated with the 
Guendalina gas field in 2011, net cash 
investments in oil and gas assets 
reduced from €17.8m in 2011 to €1.7m 
in 2012. Exploration costs in 2012 largely 
comprised the acquisition, processing 
and interpretation of 3D seismic data, 
at Area 4 offshore Malta.
In November 2011, the Company 
entered into a short-term secured loan 
facility with affiliated investment funds 
of Och-Ziff Capital Management 
Group (‘Och Ziff’), for up to €3.5m  
(the ‘Loan Facility’). The purpose of  
the Loan Facility was to assist the 
Company in funding the acquisition 
and processing of 3D seismic 
exploration data at Area 4 Offshore 
Malta. On 7 February 2012, the 
Company borrowed €2.0m (the 
‘Principal’) under the Loan Facility. 
Repayment of the entire Principal and 
accrued interest was completed on 26 
April 2012 (For further information, refer 
to Note 25 to the Financial Statements). 
Statement of Financial Position
Cash and cash equivalents at year-
end were €8.7m (2011: €3.7m). Among 
non-current assets, key movements 
from 2011 included a reduction in 
property, plant and equipment to 
€18.3m (2011: €20.5m). This decline 
resulted from the depreciation 
expense associated with the 
Guendalina project, offset partly by a 
€2.2m transfer of the carrying amount 
of Aglavizza from exploration and 
evaluation assets, following the award 
of the production concession in 
December 2012. Exploration and 
evaluation assets were further reduced 
to €19.8m (2011: €30.8m), following the 
reclassification of expenditure incurred 
at Area 4 offshore Malta, as Non-
Current Assets Held for Sale.
Financial liabilities at year end were 
€Nil (2011: €Nil), following repayment  
of the Och-Ziff loan in April, 2012. The 
reduction in provisions to €5.8m (2011: 
€8.4m) was primarily attributable to the 
reclassification of assets held for sale, 
in relation to the agreed divestment of 
onshore Italy gas assets to CIL. At the 
end of 2012, net assets stood at €53.1m 
(2011: €51.6m), and non-current assets 
were €42.0m (2011: €55.8m).
Key Performance Indicators
The Group’s key financial performance 
indicators are revenue and the 
consolidated results. Its key non-
financial performance indicators are 
the level of production and reserve 
and resources replacement (discussed 
in the Chief Executive’s Report – Oil & 
Gas Reserves and Resources on pages 
8 and 9) and the health, safety and 
environmental performance 
(discussed in the Chief Executive’s 
Report – Health, Safety and the 
Environment, on page 12).
The share price movement during the 
12 month period to 31 December 2012 
ranged from an intra-day high of 
15.95p, to an intra-day low of 3.63p. 
The share price at close on  
31 December 2012 was 10.38p.
Events after the Reporting Period
On 21 December 2012, the Group 
announced that it had signed key 
contracts with Genel Energy Plc 
(“Genel”) that enabled Genel’s 
acquisition of a 75% working interest in 
Malta offshore Area 4 PSC (the “PSC”). 
These contracts included a share sale 
agreement in which Genel agreed to 
acquire 75% of the issued share capital 
of the Group’s wholly owned 
subsidiary, Phoenicia Energy 
Company Limited (“PECL”), which 
owns the rights to exploration activity 
in Malta offshore Area 4 (“Share Sale 
Agreement”). 
Under the terms of the Share Sale 
Agreement, Genel agreed to provide: 
an immediate cash payment of US$10 
million; a 100% carry of the cost for the 
first exploration well (Hagar Qim 1), 
which is planned to be drilled to a 
minimum depth of 2,500 metres; and, 
a 100% carry of the cost for the 
second exploration well up to a 
maximum of US$30 million gross 
expenditure. In addition, at the 
Group’s option, should the costs of 
the second well exceed US$30 million, 
Genel will provide a financing 
arrangement to fund the Group’s 25% 
share of any additional expenditure 
above the agreed cap, at an interest 
rate equivalent to 3 Month Libor plus 
400 bps. Completion of the Share 
Sale Agreement occurred on  
28 February 2013.
Other events occurring after the 
reporting period are set out in Notes 
26 and 28 to the Financial Statements.
Hedging
During 2012, the Group did not have 
any oil and gas price derivatives in 
place (2011: no oil and gas price 
derivatives in place).
Cautionary Statement
This financial report contains certain 
forward-looking statements that are 
subject to the usual risk factors and 
uncertainties associated with the oil 
and gas exploration and production 
business. While the Directors believe 
the expectation reflected herein to be 
reasonable in light of the information 
available up to the time of their 
approval of this report, the actual 
outcome may be materially different 
owing to factors either beyond the 
Group’s control or otherwise within the 
Group’s control but, for example, 
owing to a change of plan or 
strategy. Accordingly, no reliance 
may be placed on the forward-
looking statements.

Principal risks and uncertainties
Exploration
There is no assurance that our 
exploration activities will identify a 
commercial discovery among the 
existing portfolio. The Group mitigates 
exploration risk through the experience 
and expertise of our specialists, the 
application of appropriate technology, 
and the selection of prospective 
exploration assets. The Group’s 
objective is to acquire additional 
exploration assets, which will diversify 
exploration risk. Furthermore, we seek to 
employ individuals and contractors with 
strong technical skills and experience in 
the areas in which the Group operates. 
Where appropriate, we work with joint 
venture partners who have 
demonstrable technical skills and 
experience in similar projects. Further 
information on exploration assets is set 
out in Note 5 to the financial 
statements.
Operations
The nature of oil and gas operations 
means that the Group is exposed to the 
risk of equipment failure, well blowouts, 
fire, pollution and bad weather. In order 
to mitigate these risks, we implement 
recognised industry operating and 
safety standards, maintain sufficient 
levels of industry-specific insurance 
cover and work only with joint venture 
partners, operators and contractors 
who can demonstrate similar high 
standards of safety, operating and 
financial capability.
Health, Safety and Environment
The Group conducts operations in 
countries in Europe and the 
Mediterranean region. There is a risk  
of incidents in our operations that have 
the potential to impact the health and 
safety of staff, contractors, and 
communities, and/or the environment. 
Such incidents may have a negative 
impact on the Group’s reputation.  
This risk is mitigated through the 
implementation of our HSE 
management system, training of  
staff, and selection of contractors.
The Group is subject to various risks and 
uncertainties, including those which 
derive from its oil and gas exploration, 
development and production activities. 
These risks and uncertainties may have 
a material impact on our performance 
and could cause future results to differ 
materially from expected and historical 
results.
The Group’s principal risks and 
uncertainties are set out below, 
together with a summary as to how they 
are mitigated. The relative importance 
of the risks faced by the Group is likely to 
change over time as we implement our 
growth strategy and as a consequence 
of external political, regulatory and 
macroeconomic developments. Business Review Corporate Governance Financial Statements
Mediterranean Oil & Gas Plc / Annual Report & Accounts 2012 17
We are extremely conscious of the 
environmental risks that are inherent  
in the oil and gas industry. We ensure 
that all relevant environmental impact 
studies are undertaken in advance of 
any proposed seismic or other 
operations it undertakes and best-in-
class industry environmental standards 
and practices are adopted in all of our 
operations. While the Group can never 
fully mitigate the cost, delays and other 
implications of future changes in 
environmental legislation and 
regulation, we establish strong working 
relationships with the local authorities 
in the countries in which we operate, to 
be best able to work through any 
potential significant changes that 
could arise in the future.
Funding and Financing
The nature of the Group’s business 
means that there are significant costs 
associated with seismic, drilling, and 
development campaigns. We manage 
this risk by a number of means. We 
closely monitor the Group’s cash 
position and each month produce 
updated cash flow forecasts to help 
determine appropriate strategies to 
fund short and medium-term 
operations. We also ensure that the 
Group always has adequate levels of 
cash on deposit, with varying terms of 
maturity, to match the items of 
expenditure as they become due. 
Further information on pricing, liquidity 
and credit risk is set out in Note 18 to 
the Financial Statements.
Currencies
The functional currency of the Group 
and its subsidiaries is the Euro and a 
significant proportion of its current 
portfolio of assets and near-term 
forecast revenue and expenditure is 
also in Euro. Certain expenditures are 
required to be funded in Pounds 
Sterling and US Dollars and we monitor 
the forecast expenditure profile and 
maintains sufficient levels of cash 
resources in Pounds Sterling and US 
Dollars to pay these expenses. We do 
not believe, at this moment, that the 
Group is particularly exposed to large 
currency fluctuations. We hold a 
significant proportion of our cash 
reserves with banks which have a 
minimum credit rating of A. Further 
information on currency risk is set out in 
Note 18 to the financial statements.
Regulation
Regulations may change with a 
consequential adverse effect on the 
Group’s exploration and production 
assets. Regulatory risk is mitigated by 
monitoring the regulatory and political 
environment within the countries in 
which we hold assets, engaging in 
constructive dialogue where and 
when appropriate, and introducing 
third-party expertise if this may assist in 
resolution of issues affecting our assets. 
Our objective is to acquire additional 
assets both for the exploration and 
production portfolio, which may assist 
in diversifying country-specific 
regulatory risk.
Risk Management
The Directors regularly monitor the 
principal and other related risks, using 
information obtained or developed 
from external and internal sources, 
and will take action as appropriate  
to mitigate the Group’s exposure.  
The main elements of the risk 
management system include regular 
Board review of the business, a 
defined process for preparation  
and approval of the annual work 
programme and budget, ethical  
and anti-bribery procedures, and  
HSE management systems.
We review the Group’s business risks 
and management systems on a 
regular basis and, through this 
process, the Directors have identified 
the principal risks. We manage some 
risks by maintaining a portfolio of 
projects and ensuring the Group is  
in compliance with the terms of all its 
agreements, through the application 
of appropriate policies and 
procedures and via the recruitment 
and retention of a team of skilled and 
experienced professionals.
The nature of our operations and 
holding structures means that the 
Group may be exposed to potential 
litigation. We are very conscious of our 
legal and regulatory responsibilities in 
all jurisdictions in which we operate 
and seek to ensure that at all times we 
act in accordance with local 
legislation and regulation. The Board 
will take appropriate legal advice from 
reputable legal firms when the need 
arises in order to mitigate such risks 
and, where appropriate to do so, will 
rigorously contest claims made 
against the Group. Mediterranean Oil & Gas Plc / Annual Report & Accounts 2012 18

Corporate responsibility
Building 
a responsible 
business
Code of Ethics/Anti-Bribery
With the corporate Code of Ethics  
and Anti-Bribery Policy, we adopt the 
principles of legitimacy, fairness, 
transparency and verifiability on  
which our conduct, as well as that of 
our subsidiaries, must rest. By making 
such a commitment, we aim to be 
publicly regarded as a responsible 
and reliable enterprise, values which – 
in our view – are key elements to our 
success and to the promotion of our 
image.
The provisions set out in our Code  
of Ethics and Anti-Bribery Policy  
apply, without exception, to anyone 
involved in the activities carried out by 
the Company and therefore to our 
directors, managers, employees, hired 
freelancers, suppliers as well as those 
who work for it directly or indirectly, on 
both a regular basis or temporarily.
Ethical Principles
Our activities must be carried out in full 
compliance with local laws and with 
the principles of impartiality, honesty, 
transparency and fairness towards 
employees, shareholders, partners, 
governments and local communities 
that the Company comes into contact 
with when carrying out its activities.
Our Key Principles
Compliance with laws, rules and 
procedures
We are committed to complying  
with the laws and regulations in force 
in countries in which we operate, 
upholding the Code of Ethics, following 
the Group Anti-Bribery Policy and the 
corporate procedures and observing 
the articles of association.
In no case may the pursuit of 
corporate interests justify the breach  
of our principles and procedures  
and Company’s representatives are 
expected to maintain compliance  
with the letter and spirit of all laws 
governing the jurisdictions in which 
they perform their duties day by day,  
in particular on:
1. Human Rights Laws
2. Privacy Laws
3. Health and Safety Laws
4. Environmental Laws
5. Securities Laws
6. Competition Laws
‘We are committed to 
promote a culture of 
honesty, integrity and 
accountability and to 
operate in accordance 
with the highest  
ethical standards and 
applicable laws and 
regulations.’ Mediterranean Oil & Gas Plc / Annual Report & Accounts 2012 22
Conflict of Interest
We will endeavour to avoid any conflict 
of interest during all the activities we 
carry out and in all the relationships 
we establish.
A conflict of interest exists both when: 
(a) either a corporate body or one  
of its members or a shareholder, or  
an employee, holds an interest that 
clashes with the one pursued by  
the Company; and (b) when the 
representatives of commercial 
partners, external consultants, or 
private or public institutions have a  
self-interest that is in contrast with the 
one they hold in relation to their office 
or function.
Confidentiality
We ensure that the information we hold 
is confidential and that no confidential 
data will be collected, disseminated or 
used unless an explicit authorisation by 
the information owner is granted and 
the Regulations in force are fully 
complied with.
Top managers, commercial partners 
and consultants must use maximum 
discretion, even when not in the 
business hours, in order to protect  
the know-how of our Company.
Relationship with Shareholders
MOG promotes equal information and 
protects its interests and the interests of 
its shareholders from any attempt by 
other shareholders or coalitions of 
shareholders to further their personal 
interests before others.
In addition, we do our best so that our 
economic and financial performance 
preserves and increases the 
Company’s value, and shareholders’ 
investments are properly paid back.
The Value of Human Resources
Employees, advisers and consultants 
are key to achieving corporate 
success. For this reason, the Company 
protects and promotes the value of its 
human resources in order to improve 
and increase experience and 
knowledge.
We also guarantee that the Company 
will provide the proper working 
conditions where human dignity 
and personal beliefs and opinions 
are fully respected in a safe and 
secure working environment.
Fairness in Employee Relations
Employee relations must be guided 
by fairness, collaboration, loyalty and 
mutual respect at all levels. Authority 
must be exercised with fairness, 
respect and moderation, avoiding  
any abuse.
In particular, any action which is  
likely to impact on the dignity or 
independence of employees, advisers 
or contractors must be avoided. 
Moreover, any choice regarding work 
planning must always safeguard the 
value of individual contributions.
Non-discrimination
In taking its decisions affecting external 
and internal parties, MOG avoids any 
discrimination based on age, sex, 
sexual orientation, health, race, 
nationality, political opinions, religion 
or any other criteria interfering with the 
fundamental rights and freedoms of 
individuals.
Quality of Services
We aim to satisfy and protect our 
contractual counterparts, while 
holding in high regard any request 
which is likely to improve the quality 
of the services and products supplied.
Environmental Protection
The environment is our main asset and 
we must protect it.
Consistent with this principle, the 
planning of MOG’s activities looks 
forward to striking the right balance 
between the commercial activities of 
the Company and the protection of 
the environment in which we work.
Renouncing Bribery and Corruption
We have implemented an Anti-Bribery 
Policy and we are committed to 
reporting any corruption that we 
encounter during our dealings with 
others.
Protecting People and the 
Environment
The Company has a firm policy of 
adhering to strict industry standards 
relating to the protection of people 
and the environment. We have 
implemented Health, Safety and 
Environment (HSE) management 
systems and policies that govern 
our expectations.
Industry practices to operate safely 
and to protect the environment have 
evolved significantly in the past few 
decades. Improvements in technology 
enable us to conduct many aspects of 
our operations far more efficiently than 
just a decade ago. This efficiency 
translates to smaller ‘footprints’ (the 
amount of surface area disturbed), 
less waste generated, cleaner  
and safer operations, and greater 
compatibility with the environment.
Oil and gas companies have developed 
and implemented sophisticated 
management systems that spell out 
the procedures that are required by 
employees and contractors to operate 
safely and to protect the environment. 
These management systems have  
been extended to include social 
responsibility and ethical considerations. 
The Company pursues a policy of 
sustainable development to balance 
economic, environmental, and 
social challenges.
The industry has shown repeatedly that 
energy production and environmental 
protection are not mutually exclusive. 
The industry can produce the oil and 
gas needed to give consumers the 
freedom and mobility they demand, 
the warmth and light needed to 
survive, and still preserve the natural 
beauty of the environment. We are 
committed to contributing to this  
goal throughout our operations.
We have had two incidents in our 
history, both of which have been 
injuries that required time off work. Our 
most recent injury was a slip, trip and 
fall incident in the first half of 2012.

Corporate Governance
Companies on the AIM Market of the 
London Stock Exchange are not 
required to comply with the 2012 UK 
Corporate Governance Code and due 
to its size, the Company is not in full 
compliance. While the Company is not 
required to present a Corporate 
Governance Statement, as it is not 
subject to the Listing rules of the 
Financial Services Authority, it has 
disclosed here certain information in 
respect of Corporate Governance.
The Directors, however, support high 
standards of corporate governance 
and intend that the Company will 
comply with the provisions of the 2012 
UK Corporate Governance Code in so 
far as it is practicable for a company of 
its size. In addition, the Directors will 
progressively adopt best practices in 
line with the 2012 UK Corporate 
Governance Code on Corporate 
Governance, so far as is practicable.
Board of Directors
The Company has appointed five 
Non-Executive Directors (including the 
Company’s Chairman) with relevant 
sector experience to complement the 
three Executive Directors and to provide 
an independent view to the Board. The 
composition of the Board ensures that 
no one individual or group dominates 
the decision-making process.
Audit Committee
The Audit Committee comprises three 
non-executive directors, meets at least 
twice a year and considers the 
Company’s financial reporting 
(including accounting policies) and 
internal financial controls. Meetings 
are normally attended, by invitation, by 
the Finance Director and a 
representative of the Auditors. The 
Audit Committee presently comprises 
Matthew Clarke (Chairman), Keith 
Henry and Peter Jackson.
Remuneration Committee
The Remuneration Committee 
comprises four Non-Executive Directors 
and is responsible for establishing and 
developing the Company’s general 
policy on executive, senior 
management and employee 
remuneration and determining specific 
remuneration packages for Executive 
Directors. The Remuneration 
Committee presently comprises: Jake 
Ulrich (Chairman), Keith Henry, Peter 
Jackson and Enrico Testa. The 
Remuneration Committee meets not 
less than twice a year.
Internal Control
The Directors are responsible for the 
Group’s system of internal control and 
reviewing its effectiveness. Any such 
system is designed to manage rather 
than eliminate the risk of failure to 
achieve business objectives and can 
only provide reasonable and not 
absolute assurance against material 
misstatement or loss. Internal controls 
and business risks were monitored in 
the course of 2012 through regular 
Board meetings.
Communication with Shareholders
The Board recognises that it is 
accountable to shareholders for the 
performance and activities of the 
Group. The Annual Report together 
with other information about the Group 
is available on the Group’s website at 
www.medoilgas.com
The Board is responsible to the 
shareholders for setting the direction of 
the Company through the 
establishment of strategic objectives 
and key policies. The Board meets on a 
regular basis and considers issues of 
strategic direction, approves major 
capital expenditure, appoints and 
monitors senior management and any 
other matters having a material effect 
on the Company.
The Board receives regular detailed 
financial and operational reports from 
senior management to enable it to 
carry out its duties. Each Director is 
entitled to independent professional 
advice at the Company’s expense 
provided that the prior approval of the 
Chairman is obtained. All Directors 
have unrestricted access to 
management and to such Company 
information as is needed to carry out 
their duties and responsibilities fully 
and effectively.
All Directors are subject to election by 
shareholders at the first opportunity 
following their appointment. In 
addition, Directors will retire by rotation 
and stand for re-election by 
shareholders at least once every three 
years in accordance with the 
Company’s articles of association. The 
composition of the Board is reviewed 
from time to time to ensure that it has 
an appropriate balance of experience 
and expertise.
Board Committees
The Board may establish committees 
to assist it in carrying out its 
responsibilities in an effective and 
efficient manner. The current Board 
committees are the Audit Committee 
and the Remuneration Committee. The 
Directors do not consider that, given 
the size of the Board, it is appropriate 
to have a Nominations Committee. The 
appropriateness of such a committee 
will, however, be kept under regular 
review by the Company. Mediterranean Oil & Gas Plc / Annual Report & Accounts 2012 24
Details of share-based payments are set out in Note 22 to 
the Financial Statements.
No person has any special rights of control over the 
Company’s share capital and all issued shares are fully paid.
Going Concern
The Group’s business activities, together with the factors 
likely to affect its future development, performance and 
position, are set out in the Chief Executive’s Report. The 
financial position of the Group, its cash flows and liquidity 
position are described in the Finance Review. The main risks 
encountered by the Group are set out in Principal Risks and 
Uncertainties. In addition, Note 18 to the Financial 
Statements includes the Group’s objectives, policies and 
processes for managing its capital and financial risk, details 
of its financial instruments and its exposures to credit risk 
and liquidity risk.
The Group expects to generate sufficient cash from 
operations for its working capital needs and its committed 
capital expenditure programme for at least the next 12 
months. As a consequence, the Directors believe that the 
Group is well placed to manage its business risks successfully 
despite the current uncertain economic outlook.
The Directors have a reasonable expectation that the Group 
will generate adequate cash from operations to continue in 
operational existence for the foreseeable future. Accordingly, 
they continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing 
the Annual Report and Financial Statements.

Post reporting date events are described in Note 26 to the 
Financial Statements.

31 December 2012.
Principal Activities
The principal activities of the Group are oil and gas 
exploration, development and production. The Group has 
its head office in London and has oil and gas interests in 
Italy, Malta and France.
The head office for operations is located in Rome,  
with a further regional base in Foggia, Italy. Subsidiary 
undertakings are set out in Note 12 to the Financial 
Statements.
Results and Proposed Dividend
The Group profit for the year after tax from continuing 
operations was €1.8m (2011: €6.5m). This resulted in Group 
Retained Losses of €12.9m (2011: €13.8m) to be carried 
forward. The Directors do not recommend the payment  
of a dividend (2011: €nil).
Policy and Practice on the Payment of Creditors
While no formal code is adopted, the Group’s current policy 
concerning the payment of its creditors is to: 
•	 settle the terms of payment with creditors when agreeing 
the terms of each transaction 
•	 ensure that these creditors are made aware of the terms 
of payment by the inclusion of relevant terms in 
contracts, and 
•	 pay in accordance with contractual and other legal 
obligations.
At the reporting date, the Company’s creditor payment 
days are 60 days (2011: 60 days).
Business Review
The Company is required by the Companies Act 2006 to 
include a review of the business and likely future 
developments. This information is contained in the 
Chairman’s Statement, Chief Executive’s Report and the 
Finance Review on pages 6 to 15.
Capital Structure
Details of the issued share capital, together with details of 
the movements in the Company’s issued share capital 
during the year are shown in Note 20 to the Financial 
Statements. The Company has one class of ordinary shares 
which carry no right to fixed income. Each share carries the 
right to one vote at general meetings of the Company. In 
addition, following the Group Recapitalisation in 2011, the 
Company has one class of deferred shares, which do not 
entitle the holder to receive any dividend or other 
distribution, or to vote at general meetings of the Company.
There are no specific restrictions on the size of a holding nor 
on the transfer of shares, which are both governed by the 
general provisions of the articles of association and 
prevailing legislation. The Directors are not aware of any 
agreements between holders of the Company’s shares that 
may result in restrictions on the transfer of securities or on 
voting rights.
Directors’ report

Corporate Governance
In preparing these financial statements, the directors are 
required to:
•	 select suitable accounting policies and then apply them 
consistently;
•	 make judgements and accounting estimates that are 
reasonable and prudent;
•	 state whether they have been prepared in accordance 
with IFRSs as adopted by the European Union, subject to 
any material departures disclosed and explained in the 
financial statements;
•	 prepare the financial statements on the going concern 
basis unless it is inappropriate to presume that the 
Company will continue in business.
The directors are responsible for keeping adequate 
accounting records that are sufficient to show and explain 
the Company’s transactions and disclose with reasonable 
accuracy at any time the financial position of the Company 
and enable them to ensure that the financial statements 
comply with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006. 
They are also responsible for safeguarding the assets of the 
Company and hence for taking reasonable steps for the 
prevention and detection of fraud and other irregularities.
Political and Charitable Contributions
During the year the Group made no charitable donations 
(2011: €nil) and no political contributions (2011: €nil).
Statement of Disclosure to Auditors
Each of the persons who is a Director at the date of 
approval of this Annual Report confirms that:
•	 so far as the Director is aware, there is no relevant audit 
information of which the Company’s Auditors are not 
informed; and 
•	 the Director has taken all steps required to make himself 
aware of any relevant audit information and to establish 
that the Company’s Auditors are informed of that 
information. 
This confirmation is given and should be interpreted in 
accordance with the provisions of s418 of the Companies 
Act 2006.
Website Publication
The directors are responsible for ensuring the annual report 
and the financial statements are made available on the 
Company’s website. Financial statements are published on 
the website in accordance with legislation in the United 
Kingdom governing the preparation and dissemination of 
financial statements, which may vary from legislation in other 
jurisdictions. The maintenance and integrity of the 
Company’s website is the responsibility of the directors. The 
directors’ responsibility also extends to the ongoing integrity 
of the financial statements contained therein.
Auditors
BDO LLP have expressed their willingness to continue as 
Auditors and a resolution to reappoint them will be 
proposed at the Annual General Meeting.

Directors’ Responsibilities
The directors are responsible for preparing the director’s 
report and the financial statements in accordance with 
applicable law and regulations. 
Company law requires the directors to prepare financial 
statements for each financial year. Under that law the 
directors have elected to prepare the group and Company 
financial statements in accordance with International 
Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the 
European Union. Under company law the directors must not 
approve the financial statements unless they are satisfied 
that they give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the 
Group and the Company and of the profit or loss of the 
Group for that period. The directors are also required to 
prepare financial statements in accordance with the rules 
of the London Stock Exchange for companies trading 
securities on AIM.  Mediterranean Oil & Gas Plc / Annual Report & Accounts 2012 26
Employee Benefits
Sergio Morandi receives a car and fuel allowance. In 2012, 
pension payments representing 10% of gross base salary 
were made to Bill Higgs and Chris Kelsall. Further details of 
Directors’ remuneration paid in the year under review are 
set out in Note 10 to the Financial Statements.
The Company provides the Company’s Directors and 
Officers with third party indemnity insurance.
Bonus Arrangements
Performance related cash bonuses may be awarded to 
the Company’s employees and Executive Directors by the 
Board, upon recommendation by the Remuneration 
Committee. No cash bonuses were awarded to the 
Executive Directors or staff in 2012. In January 2013, the 
Remuneration Committee recommended and the Board 
approved the award of the following cash bonuses to the 
Executive Directors: Bill Higgs £100,000, Sergio Morandi 
€90,000 and Chris Kelsall £71,250. Further details of Directors’ 
remuneration paid in the year under review are set out in 
Note 10 to the Financial Statements. Cash bonuses were 
paid to the Executive Directors and eligible staff in February 
2013.
Employee Share Plan
On 20 March 2013, the Board approved the implementation 
of a new long term employee share plan (the ‘Share Plan’), 
designed to provide incentives to employees to act in the 
long term best interests of the Group and its shareholders. 
Performance related share awards may be granted under 
the Share Plan to the Company’s employees and Executive 
Directors by the Board, upon recommendation by the 
Remuneration Committee. 
Long Term Share Option Scheme
On 11 March 2010, the Board approved the implementation 
of a new Global Share Option Plan (the ‘Plan’). No options 
were granted under the Plan in 2011. Following a 
recommendation of the Remuneration Committee, on  
19 January 2012, 13,500,000 options were granted under the 
Plan to the employees and Directors over ordinary shares of 
the Company. On 19 March 2012, 6,000,000 options were 
granted under the Plan to William Higgs over ordinary shares 
of the Company. Details of the terms of the options awarded 
to Directors and employees under the Plan are set out in 
Note 22 to the Financial Statements.
Following a recommendation of the Remuneration 
Committee, on 23 January 2013, 6,870,000 options were 
granted under the Plan to the Directors over ordinary shares 
of the Company. 
The Remuneration Committee (the ‘Committee’) is 
comprised of Jake Ulrich (Chairman), Keith Henry, Peter 
Jackson and Enrico Testa. The Committee is responsible for 
determining and making recommendations to the Board on 
the structure and overall remuneration package for Executive 
Directors and reviews the remuneration for the Company’s 
senior employees. It is responsible for determining individual 
remuneration packages including, where appropriate, 
bonuses, incentive payments and share options.
The remuneration of the Non-Executive Directors is set by the 
Board on the basis of a proposal prepared by the 
Remuneration Committee. No Director may participate in 
any meeting at which discussion or any decision regarding 
his own remuneration takes place. The Remuneration 
Committee also administers the Company’s share option 
and share award schemes. The Committee keeps itself fully 
informed of all relevant developments and best market 
practice in the field of remuneration.
The Remuneration Committee is permitted to appoint 
independent advisors to assist in the determination of the 
remuneration.
Remuneration Policy
The Committee, in forming its policy on remuneration, has 
given due consideration to the needs of the Company, the 
shareholders and the provisions of the 2012 UK Corporate 
Governance Code (the ‘Code’). The ongoing policy of the 
Committee is that the overall remuneration package should 
be sufficiently competitive to attract, retain and motivate 
high quality employees capable of achieving the Group’s 
objectives and to incentivise them effectively, so as to 
deliver long-term shareholder value.
It is the aim of the Committee to reward key employees on  
a basis which is linked, to a significant extent, to the 
performance of the individual and of the Company. Also, 
the remuneration is subject to the broader principle that 
their remuneration should be competitive with that received 
by professionals of comparable companies.
There are five main elements of the remuneration package:
•	 Base salary
•	 Employee benefits
•	 Performance-related cash bonus
•	 Performance-related share award
•	 Long-term share options
Base Salary
The policy is to pay a fair and reasonable base salary, 
taking into account comparative salaries for similar roles  
in similar companies. The base salary is reviewed annually 
by the Committee having regard to the performance of  
the Company, individual performance, market data, levels 
of increases applicable to other employees of the Company 
and economic conditions. The most recent salary review  
for Executive Directors and staff was implemented 
in January 2013.

their appointment, which are terminable upon the provision of 3 months’ written notice by either party. Their remuneration 
is determined by the Board upon recommendation of the Remuneration Committee. Save for the fees received under the

1 Accounting policies
Basis of preparation
The principal accounting policies adopted in the preparation of the financial statements are set out below. The policies 
have been consistently applied to all the periods presented, unless otherwise stated.
These financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs and 
IFRIC interpretations) issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) as adopted by the European Union 
and with those parts of the Companies Act 2006 applicable to companies preparing their accounts under IFRS. The 
Company’s functional currency is the Euro and it has adopted the Euro as its presentational currency. The Group has 
adopted the Euro as its presentational currency.
Going concern
The Directors consider that it is appropriate for the accounts to be prepared on a going concern basis. At 31 December 2012, 
the Group had net assets of €53.1m (2011 €51.6m) and net current assets (including Non-current Assets Held for Sale of 
€8.0m) of €16.9m (2011 €4.1m).
On 21 December 2012, Mediterranean Oil & Gas Plc (‘MOG’) signed a share sale and purchase agreement (the ‘Share 
Sale Agreement’) with Genel Energy plc (‘Genel’) which provided for the acquisition by Genel of a 75% interest in MOG’s 
wholly owned subsidiary, Phoenicia Energy Company Limited (‘PECL’). This follows the Government of Malta granting a one 
year extension to January 2014 of the first exploration phase of the Production Sharing Contract (‘PSC’) for Malta offshore 
Area 4. The Share Sale Agreement completed on 28 February 2013, resulting in MOG receiving a US$10 million cash 
payment, 100% carry on the first exploration well, and a 100% carry on the second exploration well, up to US$30 million gross 
expenditure, in relation to the PSC. At MOG’s option, should the costs of the second well exceed US$30 million, Genel will 
provide a financing arrangement to fund MOG’s 25% share of any additional expenditure, at an interest rate equivalent to 
3 Month Libor plus 400 bps (the ‘Transaction’) (Refer to Note 26 for further information).
Management has prepared cash flow projections reflecting the effect of completion of the Transaction, together with the 
effect of other Group operations, which collectively indicate that the Group can continue to meet its liabilities as they fall 
due and meet minimum spend commitments on its licenses for a period of not less than 12 months from the date of the 
financial statements.
Basis of accounting and adoption of new and revised standards 
a) Standards, amendments and interpretations effective in 2012:
The following new standards and amendments to standards are mandatory for the first time for the Group for the financial 
year beginning 1 January 2012. Except as noted, the implementation of these standards did not have a material effect on

Notes forming part of the financial statements
For the year ended 31 December 2012  Business Review Corporate Governance Financial Statements
Mediterranean Oil & Gas Plc / Annual Report & Accounts 2012 37
Basis of consolidation
Where the Company has the power, either directly or indirectly, to govern the financial and operating policies of another 
entity or business so as to obtain benefits from its activities, it is classified as a subsidiary. The consolidated financial 
statements present the results of the Company and its subsidiaries (‘the Group’) as if they formed a single entity. 
Intercompany transactions and balances between group companies are therefore eliminated in full.
The Company has taken advantage of the exemption allowed under section 408 of the Companies Act 2006 and has not 
presented its own income statement in these financial statements. The Group profit for the year includes a loss after tax of 
€3.2m (2011 profit €2.9m) in respect of the Company, this is dealt with in the financial statements of the Parent Company.
Business combinations
The consolidated financial statements incorporate the results of business combinations using the purchase method. In the 
consolidated statement of financial position, the acquiree’s identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities are 
initially recognised at their fair values at the acquisition date. The results of acquired operations are included in the 
consolidated income statement from the date on which control is obtained.
Jointly controlled operations and jointly controlled assets
The Group includes the assets it controls, its share of any income and the liabilities and expenses of jointly controlled 
operations and jointly controlled assets in accordance with the terms of the underlying contractual arrangement.
The Company’s investments in subsidiaries
In its separate financial statements the Company recognises its investments in subsidiaries at cost, less any impairment. 
The cost of acquisition includes directly attributable professional fees and other expenses incurred in connection with the 
acquisition.
Revenue recognition
Revenue is derived from sales of oil and gas to third party customers and fees received from third parties in return for 
services associated with the operation of oil and gas fields owned in conjunction with other parties. Sales of oil and gas 
production are recognised at the time of delivery of the product to the purchaser which is when the risks and rewards of 
ownership pass. Sales of oil and gas services are recognised based on the services provided and the timing of the 
provision of those services.
Interest revenue is accrued on a time basis, by reference to the principal outstanding at the effective interest rate applicable.
Tax
The major components of tax on profit or loss include current and deferred tax.
Current tax is based on the profit or loss adjusted for items that are non-assessable or disallowed and is calculated using 
tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the reporting date.
Tax is charged or credited to the income statement, except when the tax relates to items credited or charged directly to 
equity, in which case the tax is also dealt with in equity.
Deferred taxation
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognised where the carrying amount of an asset or liability in the statement of 
financial position differs to its tax base.
Recognition of deferred tax assets is restricted to those instances where it is probable that taxable profit will be available, 
against which the difference can be utilised.
The amount of the asset or liability is determined using tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the 
reporting date and are expected to apply when the deferred tax liabilities/(assets) are settled/(recovered).
Oil and gas assets: exploration and evaluation
The Group applies the full cost method of accounting for Exploration and Evaluation (‘E&E’) costs, having regard to the 
requirements of IFRS 6 ‘Exploration for and Evaluation of Mineral Resources’. Under the full cost method of accounting, costs 
of exploring for and evaluating oil and gas properties are accumulated and capitalised by reference to appropriate cash 
generating units (‘CGUs’). Such CGUs are based on geographic areas and are not larger than a segment.
E&E costs are initially capitalised within ‘Intangible assets’. Such E&E costs may include costs of licence acquisition, technical 
services and studies, seismic acquisition, exploration drilling and testing, but do not include costs incurred prior to having 
obtained the legal rights to explore an area, which are expensed directly to the income statement as they are incurred. Mediterranean Oil & Gas Plc / Annual Report & Accounts 2012 38
1 Accounting policies continued
Plant, Property and Equipment (‘PPE’) acquired for use in E&E activities are classified as property, plant and equipment. 
However, to the extent that such PPE is consumed in developing an intangible E&E asset, the amount reflecting that 
consumption is recorded as part of the cost of the intangible E&E asset.
Intangible E&E assets related to exploration licences are not depreciated and are carried forward until the existence (or 
otherwise) of commercial reserves has been determined. The Group’s definition of commercial reserves for such purpose  
is proven and probable reserves on an entitlement basis.
If commercial reserves have been discovered, the related E&E assets are assessed for impairment on a CGU basis as set out 
below and any impairment loss is recognised in the income statement. The carrying value, after any impairment loss, of the 
relevant E&E assets is then reclassified as development and production assets within property, plant and equipment and are 
amortised on a unit of production basis over the life of the commercial reserves of the pool to which they relate. Intangible E&E 
assets that relate to E&E activities that are not yet determined to have resulted in the discovery of commercial reserves remain 
capitalised as intangible E&E assets at cost, subject to meeting impairment tests as set out below.
E&E assets are assessed for impairment when facts and circumstances suggest that the carrying amount may exceed its 
recoverable amount. Such indicators include the point at which a determination is made as to whether or not commercial 
reserves exist. Where the E&E assets concerned fall within the scope of an established CGU, the E&E assets are tested for 
impairment together with all development and production assets associated with that CGU, as a single cash generating unit. 
The aggregate carrying value is compared against the expected recoverable amount of the pool. The recoverable amount is 
the higher of value in use and the fair value less costs to sell. Value in use is assessed generally by reference to the present 
value of the future net cash flows expected to be derived from production of commercial reserves. Where the E&E assets to be 
tested fall outside the scope of any established CGU, there will generally be no commercial reserves and the E&E assets 
concerned will generally be written off in full. Any impairment loss is recognised in the income statement.
Other intangible assets are held by the Group, being software and other licences. Amortisation is provided to write off the 
cost initially recognised and carried, of other intangible assets, in line with a reducing balance basis over the remaining 
expected useful life. Other intangible assets have been disclosed as part of exploration and evaluation.
Oil and gas assets: development and production
Development and production assets are accumulated on a field-by-field basis and represent the cost of developing the 
commercial reserves discovered and bringing them into production, together with the decommissioning asset (see below) 
and the E&E expenditures incurred in finding commercial reserves transferred from intangible E&E assets as outlined above. 
They are presented as oil and gas properties in Note 4.
The net book values of producing assets are depreciated on a field-by-field basis using the unit of production method by 
reference to the ratio of production in the period to the related commercial reserves of the field, taking into account 
estimated future development expenditures necessary to bring those reserves into production.
An impairment test is performed whenever events and circumstances arising during the development or production phase 
indicate that the carrying value of a development or production asset may exceed its recoverable amount. The aggregate 
carrying value is compared against the expected recoverable amount of the cash generating unit. The recoverable 
amount is the higher of value in use and the fair value less costs to sell. Value in use is assessed generally by reference to 
the present value of the future net cash flows expected to be derived from production of commercial reserves. The cash 
generating unit applied for impairment test purposes is generally the field, except that a number of field interests may be 
grouped as a single cash generating unit where the cash flows of each field are interdependent.
Decommissioning
Where a material liability for the removal of production facilities and site restoration at the end of the productive life of a 
field exists, a provision for decommissioning is recognised from the outset. The amount recognised is the present value of 
estimated future expenditure determined in accordance with local conditions and requirements. Included within the 
relevant asset is an amount equivalent to the provision which is depreciated on a unit of production basis. Changes in 
estimates are recognised prospectively, with corresponding adjustments to the provision and the associated asset.
Impairment of non-financial assets
Non-financial assets and identifiable intangibles, other than oil and gas assets, are reviewed for impairment whenever 
events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. If the expected discounted 
future cash flow from the use of the assets and their eventual disposal is less than the carrying amount of the assets, an 
impairment loss is recognised and measured using the asset’s fair value or discounted cash flows.

Property, plant and equipment other than oil and gas assets
Depreciation is provided to write off the cost less estimated residual values, initially recognised and carried, of all property, 
on a reducing balance basis over their expected useful lives. Depreciation is calculated at the following rates:
Plant and equipment – 10% per annum range 10% – 12%
Assets held for sale
Where the Company has commenced the sale of a business, any non-current assets and liabilities related thereto are 
classified separately as held for sale in the statement of financial position. This condition is only met when the sale is highly 
probable, assets are available for immediate sale in current condition, the liabilities will be transferred and the management 
is committed to the sale which should be completed within one year of the classification. Property, plant and equipment 
once classified as held for sale are not subject to depreciation or amortisation. The net assets and liabilities of a disposal 
group classified as held for sale are measured at the lower of their carrying amount and fair value less cost to sell. In 
accordance with IFRS 5, the Group also assess whether the Assets held for sale constitute discontinued operations. Where 
the Assets held for sale are classified as discontinued operations, the results of such are recorded as a single amount in the 
income statement. Comparative information relating to the discounted operations is also reanalysed into the single 
amount in the comparative income statement and related notes.
Financial assets and liabilities
The Group’s financial assets consist of available for sale assets, and loans and receivables. There are no financial assets 
classified as held to maturity or at fair value through profit or loss.
Available-for-sale: Non-derivative financial assets are classified as available-for-sale and comprise the Group’s strategic 
investments in entities not qualifying as subsidiaries, associates or jointly controlled entities. Unquoted available for sale 
investments whose fair value cannot be reliably valued are carried at cost.
Loans and receivables:
Cash and cash equivalents consist of cash on hand and cash held on current account or on short-term deposits (up to 
90 days) at variable interest rates. Any interest earned is accrued monthly and classified as finance income.
Trade and other receivables are initially measured at fair value and subsequently at amortised cost.
The Group’s financial liabilities consist of financial liabilities held at amortised cost, and held at fair value through profit 
and loss.
Trade and other payables are initially stated at their fair value and subsequently at amortised cost. All interest and other 
borrowing costs are recognised on a time-proportion basis using the effective interest method and expensed as part of 
financing costs in the income statement.
Embedded derivatives are measured at fair value at each reporting date with the movement in fair value being recognised 
in the income statement as they arise.
Convertible bonds
Where a convertible loan meets the definition of a compound financial instrument the component parts are classified 
separately as financial liabilities and equity in accordance with the substance of the contractual arrangements. The fair 
value on issue of the Group’s convertible bonds was split into their liability and equity components on the basis of their fair 
value. The amount initially attributed to the debt component equals the discounted cash flows using a market rate of 
interest that would be payable on a similar debt instrument that did not include an option to convert. Subsequently, the 
debt component is accounted for as a financial liability measured at amortised cost. The difference between the net 
proceeds of the convertible loan note and the amount allocated to the debt component is credited direct to a separate 
equity reserve and is not subsequently re-measured. On conversion, the amount of fair value of shares issued has been 
recognised within share capital and share premium. The excess fair value of the debt settled has been recognised as 
contributed equity as the debt holders are all shareholders who have acted in their capacity as shareholders for the 
benefit of the company. The Group’s convertible bonds were renegotiated in 2007, 2008 and 2009 and accounted for in 
accordance with this accounting policy. All convertible bonds have been settled in 2011.
Foreign currency
Transactions entered into by group entities in a currency other than the currency of the primary economic environment 
in which they operate (the ‘functional currency’) are recorded at the rates ruling when the transactions occur. Foreign 
currency monetary assets and liabilities are translated at the rates ruling at the reporting date.
Share capital is denominated in Sterling and translated at historic rate. Mediterranean Oil & Gas Plc / Annual Report & Accounts 2012 40
1 Accounting policies continued
Functional and presentation currency
Items included in the financial statements of each of the Group’s entities are measured using the currency of the primary 
economic environment in which the entity operates (the functional currency). The consolidated financial statements are 
presented in Euro, which is also the functional currency of the Company and its significant subsidiaries.
Transactions and balances
Foreign currency transactions are translated into the relevant functional currency using the exchange rates prevailing at 
the date of the transactions. Foreign exchange gains and losses resulting from the settlement of such transactions and 
from the translation at year end exchange rates of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are 
recognised in the statement of comprehensive income in other income and expenses.
Other provisions
A provision is recognised in the statement of financial position when the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation 
as a result of a past event, and it is probable that an outflow of economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation. If 
the effect is material, provisions are determined by discounting the expected future cash flows at a pre-tax rate that reflects 
current market assessments of the time value of money and, where appropriate, the risks specific to the liability.
Share-based payments
The Group issues equity-settled share-based payments to certain employees. Equity-settled share-based payments are 
measured at fair value at the date of grant. The fair value determined at the grant date of the equity-settled share-based 
payments is expensed on a straight-line basis over the vesting period, based on the Group’s estimate of shares that will 
eventually vest.
Where equity instruments are granted to persons other than employees, the income statement is charged with the fair 
value of goods and services received.
Options granted by the parent company to employees of subsidiaries are measured as equity-settled share-based 
payments, and expensed in the company receiving employee services.
Inventories
Inventories are initially recognised at cost, and subsequently at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
Cost comprises all costs of purchase, costs of conversion and other costs incurred in bringing the inventories to their 
present location and condition. Oil and gas production flows directly into the national grid therefore there are no oil and 
gas inventories held.
Leased assets
Where substantially all of the risks and rewards incidental to ownership of a leased asset have been transferred to the 
Group (a ‘finance lease’), the asset is treated as if it had been purchased outright. The amount initially recognised as an 
asset is the fair value of the leased asset or, if lower, the present value of the minimum lease payments payable over the 
term of the lease. The corresponding lease commitment is shown as a liability. Lease payments are analysed between 
capital and interest. The interest element is charged to the income statement over the period of the lease and is calculated 
so that it represents a constant proportion of the lease liability. The capital element reduces the balance owed to the lessor.
Where substantially all of the risks and rewards incidental to ownership are retained by the lessor (an ‘operating lease’), 
the total rentals payable under the lease are charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the lease term. 
The land and buildings elements of property leases are considered separately for the purposes of lease classification.
Joint Ventures
The Group includes the assets it controls, its share of any income and the liabilities and expenses of jointly controlled 
operations and jointly controlled assets in accordance with the terms of underlying contractual arrangements.
Critical accounting judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty
In the process of applying the Group’s accounting policies, which are described in Note 1, management has made the 
following judgements that have the most significant effect on the amounts recognised in the financial statements (apart 
from those involving estimations, which are dealt with below).
Under the full cost method of accounting for E&E costs, intangible costs are capitalised as intangible assets by reference to 
appropriate CGUs, and are assessed for impairment on a concession basis when circumstances suggest that the carrying 
amount may exceed its recoverable value and, therefore, there is a potential risk of an impairment adjustment. This 
assessment involves judgement as to: (i) the likely future commerciality of the asset and when such commerciality should 
be determined; (ii) future revenues and costs pertaining to any concession based on proved plus probable, prospective 
and contingent resources; and (iii) the discount rate to be applied to such revenues and costs for the purpose of deriving 
a recoverable value.
Notes forming part of the financial statements continued
For the year ended 31 December 2012 Business Review Corporate Governance Financial Statements
Mediterranean Oil & Gas Plc / Annual Report & Accounts 2012 41
Key sources of estimation uncertainty
The key assumptions concerning the future, and other key sources of estimation uncertainty at the reporting date, that 
have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next 
financial year, are discussed below.
(a) Impairment reviews
Whilst conducting an impairment review of its assets, the Group exercises judgement in making assumptions about future 
gas prices, reserves, rehabilitation costs, future development and production costs. Changes in estimate can result in 
significant changes to the consolidated statement of comprehensive income. The policy in respect of impairment reviews  
is set out above and details of reviews carried out during the year are set out in Notes 4 and 5.
(b) Decommissioning
Provision was made in the accounts for future decommissioning costs to plug and abandon wells. The cost of provision 
should be added to the value of the development and production asset and depreciated on the unit of production basis. 
The decommissioning liability is stated in the accounts at discounted present value and accreted up to the final liability by 
way of an annual finance charge.
The Group has potential decommissioning obligations in respect of its producing interests in Italy. The extent to which a 
provision is required in respect of these potential obligations depends, inter alia, on the legal requirements at the time of 
decommissioning, the cost and timing of any necessary decommissioning works, and the discount rate to be applied to 
such costs. The decommissioning provision and how the cost is calculated are described in more detail in Note 19.
(c) Reserves
Development and production assets (oil and gas properties) within Property, Plant and Equipment are depreciated on a 
concession basis using the unit of production method at a rate calculated by reference to proven plus probable reserves. 
These reserves have been determined using technical estimates of oil and gas in place and recovery factors. Future 
development costs are estimated using assumptions as to the number of wells required to produce the commercial 
reserves, the cost of such wells and associated production facilities, and other capital costs. The carrying amount of 
development and production assets at 31 December 2012 is shown in Note 4.
(d) Deferred tax
Judgement is applied in making assumptions about future taxable income, including gas prices, production, rehabilitation 
costs and expenditure to determine the extent to which the Group recognises deferred tax assets, as well as the 
anticipated timing of the utilisation of the losses.
(e) Share based payment
Refer to Note 22 for the keys assumptions used in determining the value of Share based payments.
(f) Liabilities
Refer to Note 28 for the contingent liability related to the dispute with Leni Gas & Oil Investments. A provision has not been 
made as the financial impact cannot be determined.

The assets affected by impairment losses are oil and gas properties. Management reviewed the carrying values of 
all properties classified as PPE to ascertain the recoverability of values in respect of concessions where facts and 
circumstances suggest that the carrying amount may exceed its recoverable amount. Recoverable amount is based on 
value in use. A discount rate of 10% has been used in the value in use calculation which has been deemed appropriate 
given the risk profile of the Group.
As a result of this exercise, an impairment loss of €Nil was recognised during the year. Also refer note 6 for Assets Held for Sale.

The intangible assets include all those costs incurred for the exploration and economical evaluation of potentially 
productive fields. In the prior period a gas storage asset held as intangible was written off to nil.
The assets affected by impairment losses are oil and gas exploration and evaluation assets. Management review the 
carrying values of exploration and evaluation assets, classified as intangible assets pending evaluation of commercially 
viable reserves, to ascertain the recoverability of values in respect of concessions where facts and circumstances suggest 
that the carrying amount may exceed its recoverable amount. Recoverable amount is based on value in use. A discount 
rate of 10% has been used in the value in use calculation which is deemed appropriate given the risk profile of the Group.

The Group has on 21 December 2012, announced that it has signed the two key contracts with Genel Energy plc (‘Genel’) 
that enable Genel’s acquisition of a 75% working interest in Malta offshore Area 4 PSC (the ‘PSC’). These are: (1) a Share 
Sale Agreement which will result in Genel acquiring 75% of the issued share capital of the Group wholly owned subsidiary, 
Phoenicia Energy Company Limited (‘PECL’) on completion, and (2) a Shareholders’ Agreement, which governs the 
operation of PECL in relation to its execution of obligations under the PSC and the rights and obligations of the shareholders 
of PECL, being Mediterranean Oil & Gas Plc and a subsidiary of Genel. Completion of the Share Sale Agreement occurred 
on 28 February 2013.
Non-current assets are classified separately as held for sale in the statement of financial position when their carrying 
amount will be recovered through a sale rather than continuing use. This condition is only met when the sale is highly 
probable, assets are available for immediate sale in current condition, and the management is committed to the sale 
which should be completed within one year of the classification. Liabilities directly associated with the assets classified as 
held for sale and expected to be included as part of the sale transactions are correspondingly also classified separately. 
Property, plant and equipment once classified as held for sale are not subject to depreciation or amortisation. The net 
assets and liabilities of a disposal group classified as held for sale are measured at the lower of their carrying amount 
and fair value less cost to sell.

Limited (‘CIL’) to transfer to CIL and/or its nominated subsidiary, the Group’s entire working interest in 13 exploration and 
production gas assets onshore Italy (the ‘Sale and Purchase Agreement’) comprising: Masseria Grottavecchia, San 
Teodoro, Torrente Cigno, Misano Adriatico, Sant’Andrea, Masserai Petrilli, Masseria Acquasalsa, Lucera, San Mauro, 
Montalbano, Serra dei Gatti, Villa Carbone and Colle dei Nidi (the ‘Assets’). The Assets are presented in the Consolidated 
Statement of Financial Position as non-current assets ‘held for sale’ in accordance with IFRS 5 Non-current assets held for 
sale and in the income statement as discontinued operations.
Under the terms of the Sale and Purchase Agreement, on Completion CIL will (a) pay to the Group the sum of €100 as 
consideration for the acquisition of the Company’s working interests held in the Assets, and (b) assume the liability for all 
future plug, abandonment and site remediation costs associated with the Assets. Upon Completion, the Group will (a) pay 
€1,250,000 to CIL as a partial contribution towards the future plug, abandonment and site remediation costs for the Assets, 
and (b) pay CIL the revenue received from the Assets during the period between the Effective Date (being 24 August 2012) 
and the Completion Date (the ‘Interim Period’), net of allowable operating costs and agreed capital expenditure 
associated with the Assets incurred by the Group during the Interim Period. Completion of the Sale and Purchase 
Agreement is conditional upon the Group receiving the approval of the Italian Ministry for Economic Development for 
the transfer of the Assets to CIL, and CIL receiving the approval of the Toronto Stock Exchange.

7 Segmental reporting
In the opinion of the Directors, the operations of the Group companies comprise three operating segments conducting 
exploration, production, and corporate activities.
The Group operates in one geographic area, being Mediterranean Europe. The Group’s oil and gas revenues are 
generated entirely in Italy and result from sales to European based customers. 92% of Group revenue is generated from 
sales of gas and condensate to four customers (2011: 94%). The reportable segments have been identified on the basis that 
these operating segments form the main identifiable cost centres for the group as reported to the Chief Operating Decision 
Maker (CODM). The CODM is defined as the Board of Directors.
The top four customers contributed the following proportions to Group oil and gas revenues:
2012 2011
Customer 1 60% 47%
Customer 2 15% 25%
Customer 3 13% 19%
Customer 4 4% 3%

profits arising in the foreseeable future from oil and gas production, most notably from the Guendalina asset which 
commenced production in the year ended 31 December 2011. The jurisdiction that these tax losses have arisen in and  
are expected to be used in is Italy.
The amount recognised in 2012 arises for Italy and relates to temporary timing differences.

government by the Italian subsidiary, Medoilgas Italia S.p.A. The non-current tax receivable relates to VAT recoverable  
in Italy of €804,000 (2011 €699,000), which is not expected to be reimbursed in the next 12 month period.
The recoverability of the current and non-current VAT receivable balances is due to be via a net reduction in taxation 
settlements made with the Italian tax authorities on charges to be incurred in the future as a result of tax liabilities arising 
from production activities.

At 31 December 2012 and 31 December 2011, the fair value and book value of the Group’s financial assets and liabilities 
were materially the same. All financial assets and liabilities indicated above with a * are shown in the statement of financial 
position at their amortised costs, which approximates to underlying fair value. Financial instruments listed above valued at 
fair value are assessed as tier 3. Tier 3 means inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data.
At 31 December 2012 and 31 December 2011, there were no financial instruments assessed as tier 2 and carried at fair 
value through profit or loss. A tier 2 classification means that inputs are other than quoted prices that are observable for the 
asset or liability, either directly (i.e. as prices) or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices).

Financial risk management
General objectives, policies and processes
The Board has overall responsibility for the determination of the Group’s risk management objectives and policies and, 
whilst retaining responsibility for them it has delegated the authority for designing and operating processes that ensure the 
effective implementation of the objectives and policies to the Group’s finance function. The Board receives regular updates 
from accounting and financial management through which it reviews the effectiveness of the processes put in place and 
the appropriateness of the objectives and policies it sets. The overall objective of the Board is to set policies that seek to 
reduce risk as far as possible without unduly affecting the Group’s competitiveness and flexibility. Further details regarding 
these policies are set out below.
The key financial instruments for the Company are the current receivables related to subsidiaries and as a result, Company 
reports are only included where relevant.
Credit risk
Credit risk is the risk of financial loss to the Group if a customer or a counter party to a financial instrument fails to meet its 
contractual obligations. The Group is mainly exposed to credit risk from credit sales in relation to gas production. It is Group 
policy, implemented locally, to assess the credit risk of new customers before entering contracts in accordance with best 
local business practices, and seek external credit rating assessments where applicable and when available. Credit risk of 
existing customers is assessed when deemed necessary.
Credit risk also arises from cash and cash equivalents and deposits with banks and financial institutions. For banks and 
financial institutions, only independently rated parties with an acceptable rating are utilised. It is the Group policy that it 
endeavours to maintain substantial bank deposits and bills with financial institutions with Standard & Poors ‘A’ rating or 
equivalent. The Group holds cash balances with Banca Intesa SanPaolo SpA (Standard & Poors rating BBB+/A-2), to meet 
minimum working capital requirements for the Italian operations.
Interest rates received on deposit accounts held with HSBC, Banca Intesa SanPaolo and Deutsche Bank are between 0.09% 
and 0.20% (31 December 2011: 0.25% to 1.04%), based on bank interest rates.
The Group does not enter into derivatives to manage credit risk, although in certain isolated cases may take steps to 
mitigate such risks if it is sufficiently concentrated.
The financial assets are aged as follows:

The Group has not historically suffered defaults from its customers for onshore gas production. The Group faces credit risk 
through onshore gas sales to Gas Plus Italiana and joint venture cash calls to Edison and Gas Plus Italiana, arising from 
various joint venture projects where Medoilgas Italia S.p.A acts as operator. The Group’s main credit risk exposure through 
its subsidiary Medoilgas Italia S.p.A, is with Repower Italia S.p.A. (‘Repower’) which at present purchases the Group’s entire 
offshore gas production from the Guendalina gas field which commenced gas production in Q4, 2011. Price risk under this 
contract is mitigated by the provision of a bank guarantee in favour of the Group in respect of a material proportion of 
forecast gas purchases under the contract. Management believes the credit risk currently faced by the Group is low given 
the high credit worthiness of Gas Plus Italiana, Edison and Repower. Gas Plus Italiana is a major Italian gas supply company 
listed on the Borsa Italiana and public filings indicate it has good creditworthiness.
The Group from time to time reviews whether a greater utilisation of credit ratings would be appropriate. Given that much 
of the Group’s trade receivables are under joint operating agreements, the security against joint venture assets provided by 
those agreements adequately mitigates any risk of default. At the reporting date, the Group does not envisage any losses 
from non-performance of existing counterparties.
Management considers that given the presently challenging macroeconomic position in the Eurozone and in Italy, credit 
risk remains elevated as at the reporting date, but that this risk has not had a material impact on earnings or shareholders’ 
equity. Management continues to monitor the financial and energy market conditions and will consider any steps required 
to mitigate associated risks to the Group. Mediterranean Oil & Gas Plc / Annual Report & Accounts 2012 52
18 Financial instruments – risk management continued
The Group seeks to maintain deposit accounts for its cash balances, primarily with banks which hold a high credit rating. 
The applicable interest rate on cash balances is also considered. Current bank deposits are held primarily with HSBC Bank 
plc and Deutsche Bank AG, with funds necessary for adequate working capital availability to the Italian operations held 
on deposit with Banca Intesa SanPaolo.
Funds which are not expected to be required in the near term are placed on short-term (i.e. up to 90 days) deposit 
with fixed interest rates for the relevant term, which reduce the Group’s exposure to interest rate risk. At the same time, 
management reviews the Group’s forecast cashflows in order to ensure that the maximum level of interest is received for 
the available funds but without adversely affecting the working capital flexibility the Group requires. There is no material 
difference between the book value and fair value of the Group’s cash and cash equivalents.
A 1% interest rate movement does not have a material effect on the Group’s financial assets and liabilities therefore no 
sensitivity analysis is provided.
Cash flow interest rate risk
The Group and Company are exposed to cash flow interest rate risk from deposits of cash and cash equivalents with banks. 
The cash and cash equivalents balances maintained by the Group are proactively managed in order to ensure that the 
maximum level of interest is received for the available funds but without affecting the working capital flexibility the Group 
requires.
There is no material difference between the book value and fair value of the Group’s cash and cash equivalents.
Foreign exchange risk
Foreign exchange risk arises because the Group has operations located in various parts of the world and because some  
of its major suppliers utilise contracts denominated in US dollars irrespective of the location where services are provided. 
Although its geographical spread reduces the Group’s operational risk, the Group’s net assets arising from such overseas 
operations are exposed to currency risk resulting in gains and losses on retranslation into Euro. Only in exceptional 
circumstances will the Group consider hedging its net investments in overseas operations as generally it does not consider 
that the reduction in foreign currency exposure warrants the cash flow risk created from such hedging techniques. It is the 
Group’s policy to ensure that individual Group entities enter into local transactions in their functional currency wherever 
possible or acquire the relevant contract currency ahead of the expenditure obligation. The Group considers this policy 
minimises any unnecessary foreign exchange exposure.
The Board continues to monitor the effectiveness of this policy on an ongoing basis through its approval of Group budgets 
and the review of the currency profile of cash balances.
Part of the Group’s borrowings, during the year ended 31 December 2011, was denominated in Sterling and the functional 
currency of the loan counterparty is the Euro. The Group is therefore exposed to changes in exchange rates. A total foreign 
exchange gain of €435,000 was recognised in the year in respect of the translation of monetary assets and liabilities not 
denominated in Euro.
The proportion of cash and cash equivalent balances held in Euro as at 31 December 2012 was 57.1% (2011: 36.4%), 
USD 26.6% (2011: 41.8%), GBP 16.3% (2011: 21.8%).

Significant balances are held in foreign currencies. The Directors have considered the exposure resulting from movements 
in foreign exchange rates in relation to these amounts. A movement of 10% would result in the balances to be restated to 
the amounts disclosed in the table above (*).
Liquidity risk
Liquidity risk arises from the Group’s management of working capital and the finance charges and principal repayments 
on its debt instruments.
The Group’s policy is to ensure that it will always have sufficient cash to allow it to meet its liabilities when they become due. 
To achieve this aim, it seeks to maintain readily available cash balances (or agreed facilities) to meet expected 
requirements. See further information on Going Concern in Note 1.
Cash forecasts identifying the liquidity requirements of the Group are produced monthly. These are reviewed regularly by 
management and the Board to ensure that sufficient financial headroom exists.
The contractual undiscounted amounts of financial liabilities are repayable as follows:

Price risk
Gas sales revenue is subject to energy market price risk. The Group’s gas revenues are sourced from the sale of gas under 
term supply contracts.
Estimated production volumes for sales of onshore gas production are set out in the contracts. The applicable gas price for 
each month is set according to a formula which is linked to the oil price that applies a constant to the average price from 
fuel oil, gas oil and crude oil (Brent) prices over each of the 9 months prior to the actual month of gas delivery. The oil 
prices which are applied in the formula are sourced from the Platts Oilgram Price Report (average of the highest and lowest 
for each oil type in each of the 9 prior months) in US$ and convertible to Euro value by reference to the average monthly 
US$/€ exchange rate, which is in the actual month of gas supply, as published by the European Central Bank. Given the 
gas price formula for onshore gas sales is based on an oil price formula which takes an average measure of the prior 
9 month period, any short-term material oil price fluctuations are likely to be mitigated. At present, the Group does not 
intend to hedge oil price risk in the short term.
The current offshore gas sale contract in respect of the Group’s interest in the Guendalina gas field has been extended 
from 30 September 2013 to 30 September 2014. This contract is similar to the Group’s contracts for the sale of onshore gas 
production and it is set to a benchmark of Italian energy market prices identified by a specific formula, in which the price  
is calculated by reference to oil-linked benchmarks and the €/$ exchange rate.
Defaults and breaches
There have been no defaults or breaches in respect of current and non-current liabilities recognised at the reporting date.
Capital disclosures
The Group seeks to maintain sufficient capital to fund its growth and safeguard its ability to continue as a going concern. 
The primary objective of the Group is to maximise shareholder value, which from a capital management perspective, is 
achieved by maintaining the capital structure that is most suited to the Group’s size, project and strategic priorities, as well 
as underlying business risk.
Currently, the Group does not pay dividends, focusing instead, on delivering capital growth by developing its exploration 
portfolio and its Italian development assets, to optimise future returns. As at 31 December 2012 and the date of this report, 
the capital employed by the Group to fund projects is comprised solely of equity attributable to shareholders. 
Management will continue to review the scope to apply other sources of capital and equity finance, such as potential farm 
outs, to support key projects. The details and movements in the Company’s share capital are set out in Note 20.

The decommissioning provision is the discounted present value of the estimated cost of decommissioning the Group’s  
oil and gas production facilities in Italy. The discount factor used is 10%. The Group makes provision for the cost of 
decommissioning its producing wells at the completion of their useful lives. There are in excess of 30 wells for which 
provision has been made. Individual final decommissioning costs vary. Decommissioning of the wells is anticipated over  
a 10 year period with additional provision to be made as new production wells are brought on stream. The time frame for 
decommissioning is based upon the projected production profile and remaining proved and probable reserves. The costs 
of decommissioning both onshore and offshore wells are certified by independent qualified engineers and specialists.
Other provisions include amounts due to employees for accrued holiday payable when they cease employment.  
The provision for €409,000 recognised in 2011 in relation to the Group’s potential liability through the subsidiary  
Malta Oil Pty Ltd for the relinquishment of the Medjerda licence in Tunisia has been released to income and included  
in the 2012 utilisation charge.

On 10 May 2011, the Group raised £20m before expenses (approximately £19.1m net of cash transaction expenses) by the 
subscription for 333,333,333 new ordinary shares in the Company (the ‘Subscription’) at 6 pence each (‘Subscription 
Price’). In addition, the Company agreed terms with the Bank of Scotland Plc (‘BoS’), Stark Select Asset Master Limited 
(‘Stark Select’) as holder of the convertible bonds (‘Convertible Bonds’), and with holders of the convertible loan notes 
(‘CLNs’), as a result of which, all outstanding amounts due to the BoS under the BoS bank facility were settled and all 
outstanding Convertible Bonds and CLNs were converted into new ordinary shares (together, the ‘Conversion Shares’)  
of the Company at a price of 24 pence per new ordinary share (together, the ‘Group Recapitalisation’). As a result of  
the Group Recapitalisation, the Group does not have any outstanding financial debt.
The nominal value of the existing ordinary shares as at 31 December 2010, was 20 pence. The issue of new shares at the 
Subscription Price therefore required the adjustment of the nominal value of each of the Company’s ordinary shares to  
1 penny, rather than 20 pence.
Conversion of convertible bonds and convertible notes
The holder of all of the outstanding Convertible Bonds, Stark Select, agreed to convert the whole of the outstanding 
principal amount of its Convertible Bonds into 19,858,333 Conversion Shares at a price of 24 pence per Conversion Share.
With the approval of an extraordinary resolution of the holders of the CLNs, the Company agreed to amend the deed  
poll constituting the CLNs to give the Company the right to convert the outstanding CLNs at its election into 21,061,225 
Conversion Shares, at a price of 24 pence per Conversion Share. The Company elected to convert all of the  
outstanding CLNs.
The original conversion prices of the CLNs and the Convertible Bonds were 40 pence and 50 pence respectively and the 
Company had no right to require conversion. The amendments to the terms and conversion prices of the CLNs and the 
Convertible Bonds were necessary to enable the Subscription and the Debt Cancellation to take place. The Conversion 
Shares were issued credited as fully paid, subject to the memorandum of association and Articles of the Company and 
rank pari passu in all respects with new ordinary shares then in issue, including the right to receive any future dividends  
and other distributions.
Share consolidation
The Subscription Price of 6 pence was below the nominal value of the ordinary shares of the Company, of 20 pence. As 
Company law prohibits the issue of shares at a price less than their nominal value, in order to effect the Subscription, a 
share consolidation was undertaken whereby each ordinary share of the Company was subdivided into one new ordinary 
share with nominal value of 1 penny and one deferred share with nominal value of 19 pence (the ‘Share Consolidation’).
The Share Consolidation resulted in 38,912,736 new ordinary shares and 38,912,736 deferred shares (the ‘Deferred Shares’) 
being in issue immediately following the Share Consolidation but before the completion of the Group Recapitalisation.
After the implementation of the Share Consolidation the nominal value of each new ordinary share was one twentieth of 
that of each existing ordinary share. Each new ordinary share has the same rights (including voting and dividend rights 
and rights on a return of capital) as each ordinary share existing prior to completion of the Group Recapitalisation. Mediterranean Oil & Gas Plc / Annual Report & Accounts 2012 56
20 Share capital continued
The rights attaching to the Deferred Shares, which have not been admitted to trading on AIM, are minimal, thereby 
rendering them effectively valueless. The rights attaching to the Deferred Shares are summarised as follows:
•	 they do not entitle holders to receive any dividend or other distribution or to receive notice of, attend, speak at or vote  
at general meetings of the Company;
•	 on a return of assets on a winding up, they will only entitle the holder to the amounts paid up on such shares after the 
repayment of £10m per New Ordinary Share;
•	 they authorise the Company to appoint any person to execute on behalf of the holders of the Deferred Shares a transfer 
of such shares to the Company, or such person as the Company may nominate as custodian, without any payment 
therefore and without the sanction of the holders of the Deferred Shares; and
•	 the creation and issue of further shares which rank equally or in priority to the Deferred Shares or the passing of a 
resolution of the Company to cancel the Deferred Shares or to effect a reduction in capital shall not constitute a 
modification or abrogation of their rights.
There are no immediate plans to purchase or cancel the Deferred Shares, but the Company may seek to do so in the 
future.
Share options
The Group’s policy is to utilise options as part of the management reward structure. Option terms are set by agreement with

24 Non cash transactions
During the period the Group had no transactions that are non cash. In 2011, the Group Recapitalisation required significant 
transactions that did not result in the payment of cash. These are set out below:
a)  Convertible debt (comprising convertible bonds and convertible loan notes) which had a carrying value of €10.9m was 
extinguished by the issue of 40.9m ordinary shares with a fair value of €2.8m. This gave rise to an amount of €8.1m being 
recognised as a capital contribution by current shareholders.
b)  An IFRS 2 charge arose on the issue of 15.9m new nil cost shares to parties involved in the Group Recapitalisation 
transaction that amounted to €2.2m and was recognised in the share premium account as a cost of issuing shares.
25 Related parties
The Company has entered into a number of unsecured related party transactions with its subsidiary undertakings. The 
transactions carried out between the Company and its subsidiary undertakings are for short and long term financing, 
details of such transactions and amounts owed to and from these entities are provided in Notes 15, 16 and 19.
Information regarding the remuneration of key management personnel and their connected persons is disclosed in Note 10.
On 8 November 2011, the Company entered into a short-term secured loan facility with affiliates of certain of its substantial 
shareholders, namely affiliated investment funds of Och-Ziff Capital Management Group (‘Och Ziff’), for up to €3.5m (the 
‘Loan Facility’). The purpose of the Loan was to assist the Company in funding the acquisition of 1,000 sq km of 3D seismic 
exploration data, in relation to its licence commitment at Malta offshore Area 4, under the Malta Production Sharing 
Contract signed with the Maltese Government on 18 July 2008 and its Addendum signed on 17 May 2011 (the ‘Licence’).
Draw downs under the Loan Facility at 31 December 2011 amounted to €nil (31 December 2010: €nil). On 7 February 2012, 
the Company borrowed €2.0m (the ‘Principal’) under the Loan Facility. Repayment of the entire Principal and accrued 
interest thereon was completed on 26 April 2012.
The initial term of the Loan Facility was eight months and the interest rate payable was 12% per annum. The Loan could be 
extended for a further 4 months at a rate of 14% per annum, at the option of the Company. The Loan was secured by a 
pledge over the entire issued share capital of Medoilgas Italia SpA, a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company. The Loan 
constituted a Related Party Transaction pursuant to the AIM Rules. The Directors of the Company considered, having 
consulted with Panmure Gordon (UK) Limited, the Company’s nominated adviser at the time, that the terms of the Loan, as 
set out, to be fair and reasonable insofar as its shareholders are concerned.

As at 31 December 2012, the Group had committed €2.9m (2011: €1.8m) in operational and exploration expenditure relating 
to various concessions. The above number represents all open/outstanding contracts and purchase orders.
The Group does not have any exploration or work programme commitments as it has the right to withdraw from its license 
areas at any stage. The Group’s share of the planned expenditure as at 31 December 2012, in the near term is subject to 
completion of the transfer of shares to Genel and is as follows:
2012 2011
No later than 1 year 441 –
Less than 1 year and not later than 5 years 241 –
Later than 5 years – –
To be incurred in Italy – –
To be incurred in Malta* 682 –
* Net of the funding under Genel farmout transaction. This includes Group share of the area rental that is due under the Malta Production Sharing Contract in 
January 2013. Mediterranean Oil & Gas Plc / Annual Report & Accounts 2012 60
28 Contingent liability
On 3 January 2013, Leni Gas & Oil Investments Limited (‘LGOI’) and Leni Gas & Oil plc (collectively, the ‘Claimants’) 
commenced legal proceedings in the Queen’s Bench Division of the Commercial Court of the High Court of Justice in 
England and Wales (the ‘High Court’), against Malta Oil Pty Limited and Phoenicia Energy Company Limited (‘PECL’) 
(together, the ‘Defendants’). The Defendants are both subsidiaries of the Company.
The proceedings relate to the purchase by PECL of LGOI’s 10% interest previously held in the Malta offshore Area 4 PSC (the 
‘PSC’). The Claimants seek: rescission of the sale agreement dated 31 July 2012 under which LGOI sold its 10% interest in the 
PSC to PECL, further or alternatively, damages for fraudulent misrepresentation, and interest on any sums which are found 
to be due.
On 25 February 2013, the Defendants filed a Defence with the High Court. The Defendants and the Company’s Board of 
Directors continue to refute the various claims which have been made by the Claimants. The Group will defend itself and 
the interests of its shareholders rigorously. The outcome of this claim and the potential financial impact cannot be 
determined at this stage and therefore no provision has been made in the financial statements.
The Genel Energy plc transaction announced by the Company on 21 December 2012, which completed on 28 February 
2013, and the proposed Malta work programme, which includes drilling contracts being signed for planned 
commencement of drilling in Q4 2013, are unaffected by this dispute.

ORDINARY RESOLUTION
6. That the Directors be generally and unconditionally 
authorised in accordance with section 551 of the 2006 
Act to allot Relevant Securities (as defined in this 
resolution) up to an aggregate nominal amount of 
£1,290,677, provided that this authority shall, unless 
renewed, varied or revoked by the Company in general 
meeting, expire on the date falling 15 months from the 
date of the passing of this resolution, or if earlier at the

In order for a proxy appointment or instruction made by 
means of CREST to be valid, the appropriate CREST 
message (a ‘CREST Proxy Instruction’) must be properly 
authenticated in accordance with Euroclear UK & Ireland 
Limited’s specifications and must contain the information 
required for such instructions, as described in the CREST 
Manual. The message must be transmitted so as to be 
received by the Company’s agent, Capita Registrars 
Limited (CREST Participant ID: RA10), no later than  
11.00 am on Friday 26 April 2013. For this purpose,  
the time of receipt will be taken to be the time (as 
determined by the time stamp applied to the message 
by the CREST Application Host) from which the 
Company’s agent is able to retrieve the message by 
enquiry to CREST in the manner prescribed by CREST. 
CREST members and, where applicable, their CREST 
sponsor or voting service provider should note that 
Euroclear UK & Ireland Limited does not make available 
special procedures in CREST for any particular messages. 
Normal system timings and limitations will therefore apply 
in relation to the input of CREST Proxy Instructions. It is the 
responsibility of the CREST member concerned to take 
(or, if the CREST member is a CREST personal member or 
sponsored member or has appointed a voting service 
provider, to procure that his CREST sponsor or voting 
service provider takes) such action as shall be necessary 
to ensure that a message is transmitted by means of the 
CREST system by any particular time. In this connection, 
CREST members and, where applicable, their CREST 
sponsor or voting service provider are referred in 
particular to those sections of the CREST Manual 
concerning practical limitations of the CREST system  
and timings.
The Company may treat as invalid a CREST Proxy 
Instruction in the circumstances set out in Regulation 
35(5)(a) of the Uncertificated Securities Regulations 2001.
6. In the case of joint holders, where more than one of 
the joint holders purports to appoint a proxy, only the 
appointment submitted by the most senior holder will be 
accepted. Seniority is determined by the order in which 
the names of the joint holders appear in the Company’s 
register of members in respect of the joint holding (the 
first-named being the most senior).
7. Except as provided above, members who have general 
queries about the Annual General Meeting should call 
the Capita Registrars’ shareholder helpline on 0871 664 
0300 or, if calling from outside the UK, on +44 20 8639 
3399. Lines are open from 8.30 a.m. to 5.30 p.m., Monday 
to Friday. Calls to Capita Registrars’ 0871 664 0300 
number are charged at 10 pence per minute (including 
VAT) plus any of your service provider’s network extras. 
Calls to Capita Registrars’ +44 20 8639 3399 number from 
outside the UK are charged at applicable international

1. Pursuant to Regulation 41 of the Uncertificated Securities 
Regulations 2001, the Company specifies that only those

through the CREST electronic proxy appointment service 
may do so for the Annual General Meeting to be held 
at 11.00 am on Tuesday April 30, 2013 and any

members or other CREST sponsored members, and those 
CREST members who have appointed a voting service 
provider should refer to their CREST sponsors or voting 
service provider(s), who will be able to take the 
appropriate action on their behalf.

EXPLANATORY MEMORANDUM
1. Items of business 2 and 3 – Peter Jackson and Enrico 
Testa have each been appointed as Directors since the

and will stand for reappointment.
2. Item of business 4 – Christopher Kelsall was last 
reappointed by the members at the Annual General 
Meeting of the Company held in 2010. In accordance

Annual General Meeting and offer himself for 
reappointment.

section 551 of the 2006 Act, permits the Directors to allot 
securities pursuant to a general authority (not restricted

proposed authority represents an authority to allot 
Relevant Securities with an aggregate nominal value 
of £1,290,677, being approximately 30% of the issued 
ordinary share capital of the Company as at the date 
of the Annual General Meeting. This authority will expire

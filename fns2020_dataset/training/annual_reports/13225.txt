20
years on…
2009 was the 20th anniversary of the opening of our ﬁrst centre in Brussels. In one way it seems like
only yesterday but it truly was another age. Europe was still divided by an Iron Curtain, a mobile phone
was something you carried on your back or in a car and if you’d said ‘internet’ to anyone they would
probably have thought you were talking about ﬁshing.
Throughout the dramatic upheavals of the 1990’s and technological innovations of the dot.com boom
we have stayed true to our core value of helping organisations, and the people that make them, work
whenever, wherever and however they want. Working smarter is as true today as it was when we
opened that ﬁrst centre.
We know this because, irrespective of the internal and external challenges we have faced, we have a
successful business which provides a much in demand service whose time, I ﬁrmly believe, has ﬁnally
come. We are in the throes of a working revolution that is changing the way organisations function, the
way people live, and the way we relate to our environment. Increasingly, people aren’t going to work;
work is coming to them.
It is now exactly a decade since Daniel Pink, former speech writer to Al Gore, wrote his book Free
Agent Nation, in which he contrasted the emerging lifestyle of the ﬂexible worker with that of the
traditional ‘organisation man’ of the late 20th century. Pink was one of the ﬁrst to consider the ways
that such lone wolves would have to be supported in order to link up with business and society –
meeting-places and networks both physical and virtual.
But whereas Pink was concentrating on self-employed people, today’s ﬂexible worker is just as likely 
to be employed, albeit in a way that is very different from the traditional employer/employee
relationship. The difference today is that the power belongs not with the organisation or employer, but
with the ﬂexible workers themselves. As these and other factors, such as the scarceness of capital
and mainstreaming of environmental concerns begin to converge I become ever more conﬁdent and
excited about our future than I have ever been in any of the last 20 years.
Where will we be in 2029? Who can honestly know with any accuracy? Personally I’ve always found
that the easiest way to predict the future is to invent it. What I can be sure of is that over the next 20
years there will be more dramatic upheavals to come and events will continue to blindside us all, but
however much the world changes and technologies develop people, and the organisations for which
they work, will always need the places to congregate and collaborate, to share thoughts and ideas, to
work wherever, whenever and however. And I know that Regus will be at the very forefront of providing
these services.

in new markets (such as Senegal, 
Estonia and Mauritius) and in new cities
in existing markets (such as Hiroshima 
and Brasilia). In the year to 31 December
2009, we grew our average available
workstations by 5.3%.
During the ﬁnancial year we opened 
45 centres for a total investment of 
£28.3 million. We will continue to 
pursue low risk targeted investments 
to strengthen our market position.
Dividend
It remains the intention of the Board to
pay dividends at a level which it believes
is sustainable throughout economic
cycles and in line with its progressive
payment policy. Reﬂecting the Group’s
trading performance and conﬁdence in
the future prospects for the Group, the
Board is recommending a 33% increase
in the ﬁnal dividend per share from 1.2p
per share to 1.6p per share This will be in
addition to the interim dividend of 0.8p per
share paid in October 2009 which also
reﬂected a year on year increase of 33%.
Subject to the approval of shareholders
at the 2010 AGM, this ﬁnal dividend will
be paid on Friday 28 May 2010 to
shareholders on the register at the close
of business on Friday 30 April 2010.
Chairman
As announced in December, I will retire
from Regus at the Annual General
Meeting in May when Douglas
This beneﬁts from exceptional net
income from settlement of a legal
dispute of £18.3 million but is after
having returned £20.0 million to
shareholders and invested £28.3 million
in developing our workstation footprint
globally. Both actions reﬂect the ongoing
success of our strategy in creating a well
balanced and resilient business mix. 
Financial performance
Group revenue has marginally decreased
2.1% to £1,055.1 million and gross proﬁt
by 22.9% to £235.6 million. Adjusting for
the impact of new centre growth revenue
and gross proﬁt decreased by 3.8% and
23.7% respectively. Average occupancy
decreased to 77.7% from 82.9% in 2008
and revenue per available workstation
(“REVPAW”) decreased 7.0% to £6,535
from £7,029 in 2008.
We continue to reduce our cost base 
to mitigate the impact of the pressures on
our revenue – in the year to 31 December
2009 we delivered cost reductions of
£54.6 million. 
All of these factors combined contributed
to earnings (proﬁt after tax) declining by
41.1% to £67.7 million and basic earnings
per share decreasing by 40.8% to 7.1p.
Capacity growth
Despite the current trading conditions 
we have continued to identify and pursue
appropriate growth opportunities – both
Sutherland, who joined the Board in
August 2008, will become Chairman. 
I wish Douglas every success and good
fortune in the role. He brings with him 
a wealth of business experience, most
recently as Chief Financial Ofﬁcer of
Skype during its acquisition by eBay in
October 2005 and Chief Financial Ofﬁcer
at SecureWave during its acquisition 
by PatchLink in July 2007. Prior to this,
Douglas enjoyed a career of over 20
years with Arthur Andersen (as a partner
for over a decade). 
I would also like to thank Martin
Robinson, who is also retiring from the
Board at the forthcoming Annual General
Meeting for his signiﬁcant contribution
over the last eight years. 
Over the past eight years of my tenure as
Chairman, Regus has been transformed
into a customer focused, genuinely
international company, now operating 
in 78 countries. The past year has seen
extremely adverse trading conditions 
but Regus is well-placed for the future,
with a strong, international management
team and a consistent strategy which I
am conﬁdent will deliver long term value
to shareholders.

Continued, robust cash generation
I am pleased to report another year of continued cash
generation for the Group. While our post-tax earnings
have fallen from £114.9 million to £67.7 million our net
cash has increased by £25.8 million to £237.0 million.
John Matthews Directors’ Report: Business Review
Chief Executive’s review
4_www.regus.com
Over the course of 2009 we have delivered a robust
performance which underscores the resilience of our
business model. Despite this once in a generation recession
and the extremely challenging and unpredictable trading
conditions which have resulted, the geographic and product
diversiﬁcation we have established – and continue to
develop – has beneﬁted us, and reﬂects the success of our
long term strategy in creating a balanced business mix.
Strategy
Our consistent long term strategy is that of measured, sustainable profitable
growth to maximise benefits for our stakeholders.
Business model
Companies of all sizes are able to leverage our diverse product range and
infrastructure to work in a more efficient manner.
Future prospects market moving to Regus
We believe there has been a fundamental structural shift toward flexible 
working, driven in part by the challenging economic environment which plays 
to our strengths. 
The nature of our business will ensure that we continue to drive
sustainable growth

Overall
The Group’s strategy of controlled and
disciplined growth has resulted in an
increase in total capacity (including non-
consolidated workstations) of 1.0% to
173,004 workstations in the year and the
number of actual workstations by 2.9% to
163,740 workstations as at 31 December
2009. The Group has opened 45 new
centres this year with the total number of
centres now standing at 983. The new
centres reﬂect the Group’s strategy of
focusing on diverse growth opportunities
with 87.0% of new centres opened on
variable or ﬂexible lease deals reﬂecting
the focus on low risk opportunities. New
locations included Brasilia in Brazil, Doha
in Qatar, Dakar in Senegal, Talinn in
Estonia and Platina in India.
Strategy and objectives 
Despite the severity of the current
downturn, our strategic approach
remains fundamentally unchanged – that
of continued proﬁt and cash generation
through controlled and disciplined
capacity growth. 
After 20 years in business, we have
barely scratched the surface of 
accommodating the way people work. 
By updating their workplace strategy,
companies will reduce overall facilities
expenses and will be in a stronger
position for success. Furthermore, with
forecast changes over the next decade
which could see the property market
fundamentally altered by huge increases
in energy and transport costs and
employee demand for a better work-life
balance, we feel uniquely positioned in
the market to support our current and
future customers. 
Against this backdrop of constant
economic and social change, we will
continue to seek to manage our business
in a sustainable way, which will have
positive impacts on the environment and
on the communities in which we operate.
We do not consider these goals mutually
exclusive to achieving our wider strategic
and ﬁnancial objectives, which continue
to be to pursue continued proﬁt and 
cash generation. 
We have taken aggressive action to
reduce our cost base and have remained
proﬁtable throughout the year. We
continue to re-evaluate our costs on an
ongoing basis and in particular look to
continue improving the efﬁciency of the
business model. In addition we will take
additional cost savings measures as
necessary and without delay, including
centre closures where continued
underperformance is anticipated. 
With continued cash generation producing
a free cash ﬂow of £80.3 million, we can
be conﬁdent that we enter 2010 with a
stronger balance sheet than was the case
twelve months ago. 
Our brand awareness continues to grow,
and whilst we are now present in 78
countries, we are conﬁdent that we can
continue to gain market share and expand
our global footprint further. We remain
ready to take advantage of sustainable
and proﬁtable opportunities for developing
our portfolio and for ensuring we are
appropriately positioned to take
advantage of a recovery when it arrives.

The fundamental drivers of our ability to
maximise what we see to be signiﬁcant
future opportunities for growth remain: 
• Needs of our customers.
• Systems and technology.
• People and processes.
Needs of our customers
It has been two decades since we
commenced trading from our ﬁrst centre
in Belgium, and our current portfolio of
nearly 1,000 centres in 78 countries is 
a testament to the growth and solidity 
of our brand, now recognised globally 
as the market leader.
Late in 2009 we undertook an extensive
survey of global business leaders to
assess what they felt the workplace of
the future could look like. The following
key trends were identiﬁed:
• Two thirds of business leaders were
implementing extensive innovations to
their workplace models over the next
three years, primarily through
implementing ‘socially-networked’
workplaces and ‘trust-based’ practices.
These initiatives actively encourage
employees to engage and collaborate
with likeminded people far beyond the
traditional workplace boundaries with 
a view to signiﬁcantly increasing
innovation and strengthening
competitive and creative developments.
• More than 40% of business leaders are
changing their workplace models to
become more collaborative in nature. 
• Technology continues to revolutionise
how individuals work and how
companies employ people – the
workforce is increasingly working from
home some of the time, with beneﬁts to
companies in terms of reduced ﬁxed-
ofﬁce space, and beneﬁts to employees
in reducing commute times and in
having an environmental upside. 
These ﬁndings also continue to be
supported by independent third party
studies which indicate that:
• it will be even more important in the
future to choose the best location for 
a business centre, avoiding locations
where workers have to commute long
distances by car; and 
• business centre operators will themselves
have to be ﬂexible in terms of what they
offer to their customers, and ready to
adapt to changes in both what clients
want and who the clients are.
In light of this, we continue to feel
strongly that the Regus product and
service offerings available accommodate
all businesses – regardless of size – and
are uniquely placed to accommodate

anticipated changes to the future
workplace on a global scale. Within the
current severe trading environment, the
Regus proposition also continues to offer
businesses immediate and effective cost
saving options with the added liquidity
advantage of no capital investment. 
Systems and technology 
Our global scope requires a constant
need for technological development 
and innovation and 2009 has been no
different. During the year: 
• we have launched our online service
agreement initiative, which involves
prospective clients being given online
visibility of their proposed, speciﬁc
agreement, in an easy to use way,
enabling them to conveniently sign-up 
to the agreement online on their PC,
without the need for printing, signing 
and faxing.
• booking of Meeting Rooms and
DayOfﬁces online via our real-time
reservation sites has been implemented.
Some 11% of all bookings now go
through this route, and we are growing
this number every month – with the
added beneﬁt of an increase in average
booking value via this route. The service
gives both a more convenient
experience for our clients as well as
reducing our cost of sale.
• there has been a further advanced
development of our centre front-desk
Point of Sale software. We now have 
a feature rich solution enabling full
support of our clients and centre teams
in this highly intuitive software.
• we have implemented our new
Business Data Warehouse, which now
sends out a daily action-targeted report
to every centre and salesperson in
Regus, who receive them at the start of
their day wherever they are around the
globe. These reports are used to focus
effort for the day, plan the coming days
and to improve overall performance.
We also continue to develop our internal
global inventory and reservation system
to meet the changing global demands of
our business. 
People and processes
After one of the most challenging years
for business that any of us can remember,
the efforts of all of our 5,500 team
members have been critical to weathering
the storm and to continuing to provide
the best level of service possible for our
customers. Our business relies upon 
our people, and from a strong platform
for growth in 2010, their continued
dedication and delivery will be critical 
to our maximising our potential. I would
therefore like to take this opportunity to

thank all of them throughout the Group
for their signiﬁcant efforts in the year. 
During 2009, we launched
“Reguscareers.com”, on a global basis,
and have seen this positively received 
by both employees and prospective
candidates alike. This interactive website,
tailored for our key global markets, allows
us to:
• highlight the wide variety of career
options available globally with Regus
• give a clear “day-in-the-life-of”
overview for a number of roles
throughout the Company; 
• provide career building guidance for
existing employees 
We have also considerably updated 
core elements of our learning and
development programmes to identify and
train the next generation of leaders, as
well as to ensure talented people within
our business are given the appropriate
training and encouragement to develop.
Speciﬁc examples in 2009 have included: 
• Creation of new sales content to reﬂect
changes to the sales process and newly
deﬁned roles.
• Introduction of ﬁeld-based Sales and
Operations Drills to reinforce critical
skills on a monthly basis.
• Development of Leadership Skills
Training for Area Directors, Area
Operations and Commercial Directors.
• Introduction of new ﬁeld manuals 
and a complete training suite to support
“SmartWorking” for centre and area
staff; driving forward consistency 
of approach and best practice in
customer service. 
• Creation of additional online learning
modules and assessments to reinforce
key knowledge and skill.
Responding to market conditions
Throughout 2009, and in line with our
previously communicated intentions, the
Group has continued to move decisively
to adapt its cost base to the increasingly
challenging trading conditions which
prevailed in the majority of its markets.
We have delivered full year cost savings
of £54.6 million when compared to 2008,
which exceeded our expectations but
which have not left us complacent. 
Costs continue to be monitored closely
and will be managed at a level which
ensures that they remain appropriate for
forecast activity levels. In addition, capital
spending is being carefully controlled to
ensure that we maximise as quickly as
possible the value of any investment 
we make and that we focus on growth
opportunities in the most resilient and
proﬁtable sectors of the global economy.

remains a key focus for the business and
we have continued to manage our cash
ﬂow tightly.
At the same time, the Group has
continued to drive forward with a number
of initiatives to increase commercial and
operational efﬁciencies within its regions,
and we anticipate completion of the
migration of certain administrative
functions into our regional service centres
during 2010. We have already started 
to beneﬁt from certain cost savings
associated with these centralised
locations, and would expect to garner
operational efﬁciencies shortly. 
In December 2009, we implemented 
a restructuring plan to further develop
and accelerate our activities relating to
the development of our regional service
centres. This plan includes reductions in
our worldwide workforce, the closure of
certain underperforming facilities, and
reductions in other related asset values.
We incurred an exceptional charge of
£2.6 million in 2009 relating to the
delivery of the initial phases of this
restructuring plan. 
Board changes
I would like to take this opportunity 
to thank John Matthews and Martin
Robinson for their signiﬁcant contribution
to the business over the years. Their
leadership within Regus has been
considerable during their tenure and they
have proven real assets to the business.
Douglas Sutherland is an excellent
candidate to succeed John as Chairman
of Regus and we are delighted that he
has accepted the role. 
Outlook
While the outlook remains unclear,
particularly for the UK, we are cautiously
optimistic across our other three
geographies. We remain focused on
increasing revenues, ﬂexing our cost
base and further improving efﬁciency 
in order to restore our margin. We are
experiencing an increased level of growth
opportunities as the trend toward ﬂexible
working accelerates. This, combined 
with our strong cash position, will allow
us to step up our new centre opening
programme in 2010.
Mark Dixon 
Chief Executive

Grow our revenue
The augmentation of our diverse product range and widening our
partnerships will enable us to increase our customer base and cross 
sell additional new services to the customer.

Performance
Our business in the Americas comprises c anada, 
UsA and south America, encompassing 483 centres
across 14 countries. Our main business in the UsA
operates 400 centres. At actual exchange rates, the
region delivered revenues of £423.8 million up 2.1% on
2008 and average mature occupancy of 79% during the
period (2008: 85%). During the year, we added 14
centres which contributed to the increase in the average
number of consolidated workstations from 70,173 in
2008 to 72,277 in 2009. We opened our ﬁrst centre in
the new market of Paraguay. 
Outlook
Looking ahead into 2010, our focus remains on
maximising our yield on our current centre portfolio,
continuing to scrutinise intensely our existing cost
structure and pursue opportunistic growth where it ﬁts
with our ongoing strategy.

Performance
Our business in emeA encompasses 248 centres across 
45 countries. The region delivered revenues of £306.2
million – down 4.0% on 2008 and achieved an average
mature occupancy of 81% (2008: 88%). During the year
we opened 15 centres which contributed to the increase
in the average number of consolidated workstations
from 32,352 in 2008 to 34,260 in 2009. We opened our
ﬁrst centres in senegal, mauritius and estonia. 
Outlook
We will seek to recover a substantial part of the 
price erosion experienced in 2009, whilst maintaining
occupancy levels, and at the same time open more
centres by exploring low risk acquisitions and new
centre openings. Furthermore the expansion of the
regional service centre in Prague will enable us to ensure
better consistency and procedures, and help us drive
cost saving initiatives further.

Regus plc Annual Report and Accounts 2009_17
Sterling weakened year on year against
both the US dollar and the euro by an
average of 14.9% and 10.0% respectively.
This would have increased our revenue
by £115.7 million and contribution by
£36.6 million. Excluding the favourable
exchange impact, revenues fell by 11.6%
and contribution by 31.2% on a constant
currency basis. 
Our mature or “like for like” business
decreased its revenues by £156.1 million
and contribution by £108.5 million driven
by reductions in both occupancy and
price partially offset by cost savings.
Centres added in 2008 contributed £35.0
million of revenue and £12.2 million of
contribution, reﬂecting our ability to
improve the proﬁtability of centres in the
year following opening by increasing both
occupancy and price. 
New centres added in 2009 contributed
£6.2 million of revenue but reduced
contribution by £1.8 million due to the
normal start up losses incurred in
establishing new centres. 
The year on year impact of closing
centres was to reduce revenue by £22.9
million and contribution by £8.6 million.
Taking all this together contribution
margins reduced from 28.4% to 22.3%.
Administration expenses
Administrative expenses increased by
£9.6 million to £167.9 million in 2009
compared to 2008. As a percentage of
revenue they have increased to 15.9%
(2008: 14.7%).
This increase can be broadly analysed: 
£ million
31 December 2008 158.3
Impact of exchange rates 14.0
31 December 2008 at 
constant exchange rates 172.3
Impact of “Smartworking” 
programme 23.6
2010 restructuring plan 2.6
Underlying cost savings (30.6)
31 December 2009 167.9
During 2009, the Group accelerated 
the “Smartworking” programme which 
is centralising certain operational and
ﬁnance processes previously carried 
out by centre staff. This has caused an
increase in administrative costs offset 
by reductions in centre costs.
As part of the on-going process of
realising cost savings, in December 2009
the Board approved a further restructuring
plan for the Group with the target of
delivering savings in 2010 of £11.3 million
(£13.2 million on an annualised basis) 
at a cost of £2.6m. These savings will 
be achieved by further improving the
efﬁciency of our back ofﬁce support
functions and sales teams through
leveraging the establishment of the
regional shared service centres and 
a restructured sales force. In addition 
we will continue to aggressively address 
the parts of the Regus network that do
not make an adequate contribution to
Group performance.
Operating proﬁt (before exceptionals)
Arising from the above was operating
proﬁt of £67.7 million (2008: £147.4
million), representing a margin of 6.4%
(2008: 13.7%). 
Exceptional income
In addition, in the period ended 31
December 2009 the Group recognised
exceptional net income of £18.3 million
from the settlement of a dispute with 
a supplier. 
Share of proﬁt in joint ventures
In the twelve months ended 31 December
2009, the share of joint venture proﬁts
attributable to Regus decreased to £2.0
million (2008: £2.3 million). This reﬂects
trading performance in the USA and
start-up losses in new joint ventures
partially offset by improved proﬁtability 
in the Middle East.
Financing costs 
Financing costs can be summarised 
as follows:
£ million 2009 2008
Interest payable (1.6) (3.5)
Interest receivable 2.6 5.3
Finance lease interest (0.1) (0.2)
Non-cash: Amortisation 
of deferred ﬁnancing fees (0.5) (0.6)
Non-cash: UK 
acquisition related (1.5) (1.5)
Total ﬁnancing costs (1.1) (0.5)
The lower interest payable reﬂects the
early repayment of the remaining £24
million loan balance outstanding on the
Group’s senior debt facility in November
2008 and the voluntary surrender in April
2009 of the Group’s £100 million
undrawn senior committed facility. 
The £2.7 million decrease in interest
receivable reﬂects the impact of falling
global interest rates (reducing the Group’s
average yield from 3.55% to 1.19%)
partially offset by the increase in the
Group’s average cash balance to £219.2
million (2008: £150.3 million). The
movement in the year end cash balance
has been explained in the cash ﬂow
section overleaf. 
Finance lease costs have remained low
reﬂecting the continued reduced level of
ﬁnance lease liabilities held by the Group.
The amortisation of deferred ﬁnancing
fees relates to the facility arrangement
costs incurred for the new credit facilities
entered into during 2006 and which were
voluntarily surrendered in April 2009
resulting in the recognition of an
accelerated amortisation charge of £0.2
million. The unwinding of discounted fair
value adjustments on the Regus UK
acquisition resulted in a non-cash net
ﬁnancing charge of £1.5 million in the 
year ended 31 December 2009. 
Cost reduction initiatives
The Group exceeded its target and delivered full year cost savings of £54.6 million 
on a year on year basis. 
The year on year saving can broadly be analysed: 
Centre Administration Total
£ million costs expenses costs
31 December 2008 771.5 158.3 929.8
Impact of exchange rates 79.1 14.0 93.1

Taxation
The Group has recognised a £19.2 million
tax charge for the period (representing an
accounting tax rate of 22.1% of proﬁt
before tax), compared to a charge of £34.3
million (23.0%) in the comparative period. 
The current tax charge for the period 
was £12.5 million (2008: £57.3 million),
a decrease from 38.4% to 14.4% of proﬁt
before tax. Deferred tax was a £6.7
million charge in the period (2008: £23.0
million credit). On a cash basis, the
Group paid £24.3 million in tax. Cash tax
represents approximately 28.0% of proﬁt
before tax compared to 21.0% in the
same period in 2008.
Earnings per share 
Earnings per share for the year
decreased from 12.0p to 7.1p with the
impact of falling underlying operating
proﬁts having been offset by a one-off
exceptional item and a lower tax charge.
The average number of shares in issue
during the year reﬂected the re-purchase
of Regus shares under the share buy-
back programme during 2008 and
consequently reduced to 948,203,737
(2008: 950,319,978). 
Dividend
An interim dividend of 0.8p per share was
paid on Friday 9 October 2009 and the
Board is proposing a ﬁnal dividend of
1.6p per share. Subject to shareholder
approval the full year dividend will have
increased 33% year on year. 
The Group will continue to operate the
Income Access Share arrangements for
the ﬁnal dividend to enable shareholders
to receive either UK sourced dividends 
or Luxembourg sourced dividends.
Currency hedging
During 2009, the Group implemented a
policy approved by the Board to hedge,
subject to strict limits, the rates at which
we translate our overseas earnings. As a
result the Group realised currency hedging
gains of £2.2 million which partially offset
the impact of the ﬂuctuations in sterling
during the year. The Group intends to
continue with this strategy in 2010.
Goodwill
Regus has £259.1 million of goodwill in
the balance sheet largely arising from the
purchase in August 2004 of HQ Global
Holdings Inc. and the purchase in April
2006 of the remaining 58% interest in the
Regus UK business not already owned.
The carrying value of the goodwill was
tested for impairment at the year end
and indicated that no impairment was
necessary. Although the short term
performance of the business has
worsened since the 2008 impairment
review was carried out, the relatively 
high discount rates that were previously
applied by the market to our future cash
ﬂows have also reduced. It should be
noted, however, that the headroom 
in the calculations particularly with 
respect to the UK, remains low. It is
therefore possible that a future, non-
cash, impairment may be necessary
arising from relatively small changes 
in assumptions. Full details of the
approach taken and sensitivities are
provided in note 12.
Cash ﬂow from operations has fallen
£144.5 million from £249.6 million to
£105.1 million driven both by the impact
of the fall in operating proﬁt and an
outﬂow of working capital. As occupancy
and price increased in 2008 the business
beneﬁted from a working capital inﬂow 
of £35.7 million and as it has declined in
2009 there has been a working capital
outﬂow of £39.4 million. 
Nevertheless the business has remained
strongly cash positive producing a free
cash ﬂow of £80.3 million. This has
allowed the Group to continue to invest 
in growth and increase the dividend. 
During 2009, 45 new centres were opened
at a cost of £28.3 million. In addition to the
investment in growth the Group returned
£20.0 million to shareholders through the
payment of the 2008 ﬁnal and 2009
interim dividends and still ended the year
with an increased cash position. This can
be analysed as follows:
(£ million 2009 2008
Cash and cash 
equivalents 205.1 219.5
Liquid investments 40.0 –
Bank and other loans (6.0) (5.3)
Finance leases (2.1) (3.0)
Net ﬁnancial 
assets/net cash 237.0 211.2
Liquid investments are comprised of cash
balances invested for over three months
to improve the interest yield. At the
balance sheet date the longest remaining
maturity was approximately four months.
Of the net cash balance £47.0 million is
pledged as security against outstanding
bank guarantees and a further £17.3
million is pledged against various other
commitments of the Group.
In summary, given the robust cash
performance in 2009 the Group is 
both well positioned to manage 
the continuing uncertain economic
climate as well as capitalise on the
many growth opportunities that exist 
in our market place.

Corporate responsibility
Regus plc Annual Report and Accounts 2009_19
Our approach to Corporate Responsibility
(CR) has never been about writing big
cheques and planting trees; we are well
aware of the plethora of evidence that
demonstrates a company’s long term
performance will beneﬁt from a broad,
planned and sustained CR programme.
There are four elements to our CR plan:
• Workforce
• Marketplace 
• Environment
• Community
As the table overleaf shows we have
established a number of Key Performance
Indicators for Corporate Responsibility
and over the coming years we will report
our performance against these at each 
full results announcement. 
Regus has always had a good track
record when it comes to social
responsibility and community
involvement as some of the examples
overleaf bear out. But we are now putting
greater emphasis on our response to
climate change as well as putting a more
coherent structure around the other
elements of our CR strategy.
Workforce
Our long term success depends on
attracting and retaining the most talented
people to work for us across 78 countries.
Diversity and inclusion
Regus is committed to providing a work
environment in which all individuals are
treated with respect and dignity. Each
individual has the right to work in a
professional atmosphere that promotes
equal employment opportunities and
prohibits discriminatory practices,
including harassment. Therefore, the
Company expects that all relationships
among persons in the workplace are
business-like and free of bias, prejudice
and harassment. 
It is the policy of Regus to ensure equal
employment opportunity without
discrimination or harassment on the basis
of race, colour, religion, gender, marital
status, age, national origin, disability, or
any other protected characteristic as
established by law. The Company
prohibits and does not tolerate any such
discrimination or harassment. Indeed on
a number of metrics Regus can be seen
as best practice and industry leading;
more than 60% of our workforce and
50% of our middle and senior managers
are female. In all markets our workforce is
broadly representative of the ethnic make
up of the wider community.
Health and wellbeing
Protecting and promoting the wellbeing 
of our employees is an integral part of the
Regus culture. We demand the highest
standards of health and safety whilst
encouraging our employees to enjoy a
healthy and active lifestyle. Regus offers
generous holiday packages in all countries
and encourages its team members to take
time off in order to rejuvenate and create 
a balance between work and home life. 
In the Americas we provide a 2 week
sabbatical for team members who reach
their 10 year anniversary. In our facilities
with gyms in the building our team
members are encouraged to utilise the
facilities. In November 2009 a wellness
road show was held in our Dallas
Corporate ofﬁce where free biometric
screenings were provided and where team
members could get advice on nutrition,
preventative care and other medical issues.
Skills and talent
Our goal has always been to create an
environment in which our people can
develop their talents, realise their ambitions
and achieve their best work. In 2009 we
radically overhauled the quality and
quantity of training provided to team
members. We doubled the amount of
face-to-face training we provided to more
than 8,500 training sessions and team
members took part in more than 37,000
online training sessions on subjects as
diverse as Sales Techniques, Leading and
Managing the Team and The Perfect Tour.
Recruiting and training school and
university leavers remains a high priority
for the business around the world.
Examples include:
• In India and East Asia 14 graduate
trainees were hired from the Institute 
of Hotel Management. 
• In Greater China 10 graduate trainees
were recruited from Fudan University
Shanghai, Polytechnic University 
Hong Kong and Chinese University,
Hong Kong. 
• In France we have a close relationship
with Paris based École Française
As a responsible global company and leader in its ﬁeld
Regus wants to be best in its class for corporate
responsibility and this year has brought it to the top of our
agenda. We have established clearly where we are and
where we want to be as well as what we are good at and
what we need to do better.
Responsive to our stakeholders
Business Review Corporate Governance Financial Statements Shareholder Information d’hôtesse et de tourisme school which
results in students spending half of 
their time working at our centres whilst
they study.
• In the Netherlands we work with
Rotterdam based ROC Zadkine College
which provides us with some 15-20
workplace students for four month long
placements each year.
• We have had a traineeship programme
running in Germany for many years. 
The annual intake is two and the
trainees spend on average three years
with the business working across
different functions before being placed
in a permanent position.
We are also driven to progress the
careers of our team members, more 
than 10% received a promotion in 2009.
Regus also encourages cross border
opportunities; team member exchanges
have happened between Brazil and the
US, UK to Germany, US to Australia
amongst many others.
Marketplace 
Customers
Like any prudent company we know 
that without customers we don’t have 
a business; treating them with respect is
part and parcel of what we do. At Regus
we deﬁne respect as being mindful of
speciﬁc and unique needs, allowing them
absolute choice in what they want and
when they want it; providing the right
level of accessible information in the right
form, always selling with honesty and
integrity, and ﬁnally ensuring at all times
the safety of our customers.
With more than 500,000 individual
customers we take great effort to solicit
regular feedback on all aspects of our
product portfolio and service delivery
both in centre and from our regional
service centres. Such feedback is regularly
acted upon to enhance what we do.
Suppliers
Regus only selects products and
solutions from suppliers which take an
active role within their community and
look to minimise the environmental
impact of their operations. All new
suppliers are asked to comment on how
they address each of the following areas:
• maintaining a healthy and safe
environment for staff;
• work with and support for local charities
and groups;
• energy efﬁciency and the use of low
carbon assets; and,
• waste minimisation and recycling.
Environment
As a responsible company we want to
signiﬁcantly reduce our environmental
impact and support our clients in doing
the same. In 2010 in the UK we are
consequently putting in place a robust
programme of measures to reduce our
carbon footprint by 50% by 2020 (using
our 2007 baseline) which will then be
rolled out to other geographies in
subsequent years. To show our ﬁrm
commitment we will be making every
effort to achieve 20% of this target by 31
December 2010. This will be achieved by:
1. Liaising and working together with our
property stakeholders to implement a
prioritised and visible carbon reducing
energy saving plan in all our ofﬁces
whilst complying fully with the
requirements of the CRC;
Regus CR Key Performance Indicators in the UK
Activity 2010 target
Reduction in carbon footprint 20% reduction on 2007 levels.
Water usage 5% reduction on 2007 levels.
Waste 5% reduction on 2007 levels.
Transport Reduce air miles by 20% and increase rail travel by 20% on 2007 levels.
Corporate charity Enable employees to select in-country corporate charity on an annual basis.
Employee volunteer days 500 days available to employees globally to partake in community 
based activities.
Suppliers All major suppliers signed up to Regus CR policy.
Recruitment and training Implement a formal graduate training programme in US, UK, France, 
the Netherlands, China and India.
Team member career Implement a global group training certiﬁcation process for all customer facing 
development and training role holders.
2. Integrating our planned and reactive
maintenance strategies to include
better energy saving and carbon
reduction measures;
3. Reviewing our new centre 
opening strategy to accommodate
better energy saving and carbon
reduction principles;
4. Working with our clients as 
necessary to help them reduce 
their carbon footprints;
5. Engaging and involving our staff 
and suppliers in the formation and
operation of carbon reduction policies;
6. Training as appropriate all our staff
involved in our carbon reduction
implementation;
7. Communicating our strategy to all our
staff and clients and supporting them
in its implementation;
8. Moving towards more renewable energy
sources as soon as practicable; and,
9. Measuring, reviewing, acting quickly
and communicating the outcomes.
Community
Our centres are visible landmarks within
the communities in which they reside. 
As such we strive to play a positive
community based role as well as
supporting those in need further aﬁeld.
From competing in triathlons and other
sports activities to raise money for charity
to recycling waste paper to help a local
hospital and donating redundant ofﬁce
furniture to local schools our community
activity is not a directed corporate edict
but a bottom up desire by our team
members to make a difference. Just a
few of our many examples from around
the world are highlighted on this page.

Macmillan Cancer Support
For many years Regus employees in
the UK have competed in the London
Triathlon and with the help of their
colleagues raised many tens of
thousands of pounds. 2009 was no
exception and 25 brave souls took 
to the streets and waters of London
raising more than £10,000. 
“Macmillan Cancer Support would like
to say a big thank you to all the Regus
staff in the UK for their support and of
course to those that took part in the
Triathlon itself!” 
Helen Rogers, 
Macmillan Fundraising Manager
Warran Autism Training Center, 
Giant Steps Illinois, Chicago
A recent downsize at the Warrenville
centre in suburban Chicago left the
team with excess furniture. The team
donated the furniture to the Autism
Training Center at Giant Steps Illinois.
The organization had just leased a
70,000 square foot facility in nearby
Lisle and had no budget to furnish 
the space.
“I can’t begin to express our gratitude
for the furniture donated by Regus.
You have made an enormous impact
on our ability to reach out and train 
the greater autism community. Your
contribution has made us look like 
a “real” school.”

Warran Autism Training Center
Centre Recycling in Argentina funds
local hospital 
Since opening two years ago, the
team at Regus Olivos Libertador in
Buenos Aires has been doing its part
to help clean up the environment.
Their recycling efforts also beneﬁt a
local hospital. Every week the centre
donates its cardboard and plastic
items to the Garrahan Foundation. 
The foundation collects recyclables
from businesses, schools and
households throughout Buenos Aires
and sells them to a recycling
company. So far, more than 42,000
tons of paper items have been
recycled. The money collected from
the programme is allocated to various
local social service organisations,
including Casa Garrahan, a home for
children receiving medical treatment. 
Katie Piper Foundation
Katie Piper is a 26 year old woman
who was the victim of a vicious acid
attack in 2008 which destroyed her
face, her life and her career as she
knew it. In October 2009 she told her
story in a tv documentary, this resulted
in a huge response from the public. 
As a result, Katie set up the Katie
Piper Foundation to help other burns
victims like herself. Regus is providing
the foundation with its ofﬁce space.
“Since October 2009 when the
documentary went out I have been
overwhelmed by the amount of offers
of support I’ve had. Regus were one
of the ﬁrst organisations to contact me
and I wouldn’t have been able to set
up my charity without them. They have
been instrumental in allowing me to
register the charity.”

South Florida Team Lends a Hand 
for Local Charity 
Former Miami Dolphins star and
Regus client, OJ McDufﬁe, is an active

Catch 81 Foundation is committed to
helping the less fortunate throughout
the region. 
McDufﬁe recently organised his ﬁrst
annual charity softball event and
invited Regus team members from
South Florida to participate in the
tournament. Although team Regus
lasted only two games in the
tournament, they managed to raise
$1,000 to help children in need. 
Team members recently put their
endurance to the test at the Toyota 
US Open Triathlon in Dallas raising
money to beneﬁt the Make-A-Wish
Foundation. Twenty team members
competed and two of our teams took
ﬁrst and second place in the sprint
relay, raising US$28,000

the community.”

statements, the Directors have considered the further information
included in the business activities commentary as set out on

uncertainties as set out on pages 28 and 30. Based on the

redeployment elsewhere within the Group.

in the UK or overseas. The Group made charitable donations 
of £0.1 million during the year (2008: £0.1 million). For more information visit

26_www.regus.com
The Board is committed to the high standards of corporate
governance set out in the Combined Code published in June
2008 (“the Code”) for ﬁnancial periods beginning after
29 June 2008. The Board is accountable to the Company’s
shareholders and this report describes how the Board applied
the principles of good governance. In its prospectus dated 
8 September 2008 the Company stated its intention to
voluntarily comply with the Combined Code so far as it is
practical for a Luxembourg company to do so. There is no
similar corporate governance regime in Luxembourg. 
The Board
At 31 December 2009, the Board of Directors was made up 
of seven members comprising the Chairman, two executive
directors and four non-executive directors. Biographical
details of the directors are set out on pages 22 and 23. 
Role of the Board
The primary role of the Board is to provide entrepreneurial
leadership and to review the overall strategic development 
of the Group. The Board approves the corporate plan 
and the annual budget and reviews performance against
targets at every meeting. Through the Audit Committee, the
directors ensure the integrity of ﬁnancial information and the
effectiveness of ﬁnancial controls and the internal control and
risk management system. The Board has delegated authority
to the Remuneration Committee to set the remuneration
policy for directors and senior management. The Nomination
Committee recommends the appointment of Board Directors
and has responsibility for succession planning at Board level.
The various Board Committees (the “Committees”) have
authority to make decisions in their areas of expertise. 
Frequency of meetings
There were nine Board meetings during 2009. 
The number of meetings of the Board and Committees and
individual attendance by the directors are shown below.

Matters reserved for the Board
The Board has a formal schedule of matters reserved to it for
its decision, to ensure that no one individual has unfettered
powers of decision. These include:
• Approval of regulatory announcements including the interim
and annual ﬁnancial statements.
• Terms of reference and membership of the Board and its
Committees.
• Changes to the Group’s capital structure.
• Changes to the Group’s management and control structure.
• Capital investment in excess of £5 million.
• Material contracts (annual value in excess of £5 million).
Minutes are taken of all Board discussions and decisions 
and all directors are encouraged to request inclusion of any
unresolved concerns that they may have in the Board minutes. 
Roles of Board members
There is a clear division of responsibilities between the
Chairman and the Chief Executive. 
The Chairman
John Matthews is responsible for leadership of the Board,
setting its agenda and monitoring its effectiveness. He
ensures effective communication with shareholders and that
the Board is aware of the views of major shareholders. He
facilitates both the contribution of the non-executive directors
and constructive relations between the executive directors
and non-executive directors. 
The Chairman, together with the Company Secretary, are
responsible for ensuring all directors are properly briefed on
issues arising at Board meetings and that they have full and
timely access to relevant information. 
The Chairman is not deemed to be independent. 
On 18 December 2009, it was announced that John Matthews
will retire from the Board with effect from 18 May 2010 (the
date of the next Annual General Meeting) and will be replaced
as Chairman by Douglas Sutherland, who joined the Board 
in August 2008.
The Chief Executive
Mark Dixon is responsible for formulating strategy and for its
delivery once agreed by the Board. He creates a framework 
of strategy, values, organisation and objectives to ensure the
successful delivery of key targets, and allocates decision-
making and responsibilities accordingly. 
Non-executive directors
The non-executive directors each bring their own senior level 
of experience and objectivity to the Board. The independent
counsel brought to the group by the non-executives
enhances the overall decision making of the Board. Non-
executives are appointed for an initial three year term, subject
to election by shareholders at the ﬁrst Annual General
Meeting (“AGM”) after their appointment. 
On 18 December 2009, it was announced that Martin
Robinson, senior independent non-executive director and
Chairman of the Remuneration Committee, will also retire
from the Board with effect from 18 May 2010 (the date of the
next AGM). The Board will seek to appoint a new international
independent non-executive director in due course.
Company Secretary 
The Company Secretary, Tim Regan, is responsible for
advising the Board, through the Chairman, on all governance
matters and for ensuring that appropriate minutes are taken
of all Board meetings and discussions. The appointment and
removal of the Company Secretary is a matter reserved for
the Board. For more information visit

to keep under review the independence and objectivity of the
external auditors, the effectiveness of the audit process and
the rotation of the lead audit partner.
The scope and extent of non-audit work undertaken by 
the Company’s external auditor is monitored by and, above
certain thresholds, requires prior approval from the Audit
Committee to ensure that the provision of non-audit services
does not impair their independence or objectivity. During 
the year, KPMG performed due diligence work on certain
acquisitions. KPMG is prohibited from providing services that
would be considered to jeopardise their independence such
as book keeping services, valuations and system design.

under review the leadership needs of the organisation 
to enable it to compete effectively. 
Principal risks and uncertainties
There are a number of risks and uncertainties which could
have an impact on the Group’s long-term performance. The
group has a risk management structure in place designed to
identify, manage and mitigate business risks. Risk assessment
and evaluation is an essential part of the annual planning,
budgeting and forecasting cycle. 
The directors have identiﬁed the following principal risks and
uncertainties affecting the company. These do not constitute
all of the risks facing the Group. 
Economic downturn in signiﬁcant markets
The Group has a signiﬁcant proportion of its centres in the
Americas (predominantly the USA) and Europe. An economic
downturn in these markets could adversely affect the Group’s
operating revenues thereby reducing operating performance
or, in an extreme downturn, resulting in operating losses.
Generally, the terms on which the Group earns revenues 
from customers and pays its suppliers (principally landlords)
are matched to reduce working capital needs. However, 
a reduction in revenues, with no immediate decline in the 
cost base, could result in signiﬁcant funding shortfalls in 
the business. Any funding shortfall may require the Group 
to seek external funding or sell assets in the longer term.
In addition, competition may increase as a result of landlords
offering surplus space at discounted prices and companies
seek to reduce their costs by sub-letting space. These factors
could result in reduced revenue for the Group as the prices it
is able to charge customers would be reduced. 
The Group has taken a number of actions to mitigate this risk:
• The Group has entered into performance based leases 
with landlords where rent costs vary with revenues earned
by the centre. 
• Building lease contracts include break clauses at periodic
intervals to allow the Group to exit leases should they
become onerous. In cities with a number of centres this
allows the Group to stagger leases such that an orderly
reduction in exposure to the location may be facilitated. 
• The proﬁle of clients in a centre is continually reviewed 
to avoid undue reliance on a particular client or clients 
in a particular industry group. 
Additionally, in the event of a downturn, the Group has 
a number of options for mitigating losses, for example 
by closing centres at lease break points. 
The Group’s strategy also focuses its growth into emerging
markets that will reduce the proportion of the Group’s revenue
generated from the USA and Europe over time and provide
better protection to the Group from an economic downturn 
in a single market.
Exposure to movements in property markets
A number of the Group’s lease contracts contain market rent
review clauses. This means that the costs of these leases
may vary as a result of external movements in the property
market. In particular, in the UK, lease contracts typically
contain ‘upward only’ rent reviews which means that should
open market rents decrease, then Regus could be exposed 
to paying higher than market rent in these locations. 
If the Group is unable to pass on increased rent costs to
customers due to local property market conditions then 
this could result in reduced proﬁtability or operating losses 
in these markets. 
Equally, for Group lease contracts without market rent review
clauses, the Group may beneﬁt from paying below market
rent in a market with increasing open market rents. This may
allow the Group to improve proﬁtability if the movements 
in open market rents are passed on to clients.
The length of the Group’s leases (or the period after which 
the Group can exercise any break option in the leases) is
usually signiﬁcantly longer than the duration of the Group’s
contracts with its customers. If demand falls, the Group may
be unable to increase or maintain occupancy or price levels
and if revenue declines the Group may be unable to reduce
the lease cost base. Additional costs could be incurred if the
Group disposes of unproﬁtable centres. 
Changes in assumptions underlying the carrying value of 
certain Group assets could result in impairment.
Regus completes a review of the carrying value of its assets
annually to assess whether those carrying values can be
supported by the net present value of future cash ﬂows derived
from such assets. This review examines the continued
appropriateness of the assumptions in respect of which the
carrying values of certain of the Group’s assets are based. 
This includes an assessment of discount rates and long term
growth rates, and timing and quantum of future capital
expenditure. Due to the Group’s substantial carrying value of
goodwill under IFRS, the revision of any of these assumptions 
to reﬂect current or anticipated changes in operations or the
ﬁnancial condition of the Group could lead to an impairment 
in the carrying value of certain assets in the Group. While
impairment does not impact reported cash ﬂows, it does result 
in a non-cash charge in the consolidated income statement and
thus no assurance can be given that any future impairments
would not affect the Company’s reported distributable reserves
and therefore its ability to make distributions to its shareholders
or repurchase its shares. 
The Group’s geographic expansion may increase exposure 
to unpredictable economic, political and legal risks.
Political, economic and legal systems in emerging markets
historically are less predictable than in countries with more
developed institutional structures. As the Group increasingly
enters into emerging markets, the value of the Group’s
investments may be adversely affected by political, economic
and legal developments which are beyond the Group’s control.
Exposure to movements in exchange rates
The Group has signiﬁcant overseas operations whose
businesses are generally conducted in the currency of the
country in which they operate. The principal exposures of the
Group are to the US dollar and the euro with approximately
39% of the Group’s revenues being attributable to the US
dollar and 19% to the euro respectively. 
Given that transactions generally take place in the functional
currency of Group companies, the Group’s exposure to
transactional foreign exchange risk is limited. However, the For more information visit
regus.com
Regus plc Annual Report and Accounts 2009_29
translation into sterling of overseas proﬁts and net assets 
will be affected by prevailing exchange rates. In the event that
either the US dollar or euro were to signiﬁcantly depreciate 
or appreciate against sterling, this would have an adverse or
beneﬁcial impact to the Group’s reported performance and
position respectively. 
The ﬁnancial risk management objectives and policies of the
Group, together with an analysis of the exposure to such risks
are set out in note 23 of the Accounts. Wherever possible, 
the Group attempts to create natural hedges against currency
exposures through matching income and expense and assets
and liabilities in the same currency. 
Given the continued volatility in exchange rates in January
2009 the Board approved a policy which allows the Group 
to hedge, subject to strict limits, the rates at which overseas
earnings are translated. This will enable the Group to have
more certainty over the sterling value of these earnings.
Group reorganisation and restructuring
In October 2008, the Group entered into a Group
reorganisation to create a new Group structure.
Reorganisations of international groups can lead to a risk 
of a signiﬁcant tax liability. In addition, as a result of the
scheme, it is expected that Regus plc will be regarded as 
tax resident solely in Luxembourg. If Regus plc were
nonetheless to be treated as tax resident in any other
jurisdiction, this could lead to an increase in the overall
effective tax rate and tax compliance costs of the Group.
As a Jersey-incorporated company having its place of central
administration (head ofﬁce) in Luxembourg and being tax
resident in Luxembourg, Regus plc is required to comply with
both Jersey law and Luxembourg law, where applicable. In
addition, Regus plc’s ordinary shares are listed on the Ofﬁcial
List of the UKLA and admitted to trading on the main market
of the London Stock Exchange. It is possible that conﬂicts
may arise between the obligations of Regus plc under the
laws of each of these jurisdictions or between the applicable
laws and the Listing Rules. If an irreconcilable conﬂict were 
to occur then Regus plc may not be able to maintain its
status as a company tax resident in Luxembourg.
The Group manages the risk that a signiﬁcant tax liability
could arise by taking appropriate advice, both in carrying out
the Group reorganisation and on an ongoing basis. In addition,
the Group believes that under current laws and regulations
the risk of irreconcilable conﬂicts between current laws and
regulations impacting Regus plc is also low.
As part of the Group reorganisation, the Group announced
plans to operate an income access share (“IAS”) arrangement
for the payment of dividends. The Group expects that
dividends will be paid to Regus plc shareholders who make
(or are deemed to make) an IAS election through the IAS
arrangements. However there can be no certainty that
dividends will be paid in this way and the IAS arrangements
may be suspended or terminated at any time and for any
reason. If the IAS arrangements do no operate shareholders
will be paid dividends by Regus plc which may be subject to
Luxembourg withholding tax. In addition, there is a low risk
that share buy-backs undertaken by Regus plc could also be
subject to Luxembourg withholding tax. 
Centrally managed applications, systems and regional shared
service centres
The Group has moved to a centrally managed applications and
systems environment with the resultant effect that all systems
and applications are housed in a central data centre. Should
the data centre and regional shared service centres be
impacted as a result of circumstances outside of the Group’s
control there could be an adverse impact on the Group’s
operations and therefore its ﬁnancial results. This risk is
managed through a detailed service arrangement with our
external data centre provider which incorporates appropriate
back-up procedures and controls.
Internal controls
The Board has ultimate responsibility for maintaining 
a sound system of internal control and for periodically
reviewing its effectiveness. 
In accordance with the guidance set out in the Turnbull Report
“Internal Control: Guidance for Directors on the Combined
Code”, an ongoing process has been established for
identifying, managing and evaluating the risks faced by the
Group. The Group’s system of internal controls is designed to:
• facilitate the effective and efﬁcient response to risks which
might affect the achievement of the Group’s objectives.
• safeguard assets from inappropriate use or from loss or fraud.
• help ensure the quality of internal and external 
ﬁnancial reporting.
• help ensure compliance with applicable laws and regulations.
No system of internal control can provide absolute assurance
against material misstatement or loss. The Group’s system 
of controls helps to manage rather than eliminate the risk of
failure to achieve business objectives, and can only provide
reasonable assurance that potential problems will normally 
be prevented or will be detected in a timely manner for
appropriate action.
Strategy and risk management
The Board conducts regular reviews of the Group’s strategic
direction. Country and regional strategic objectives, quarterly
plans and performance targets for 2010 have been set by the
executive directors and are regularly reviewed by the main
Board in the context of the Group’s overall objectives. 
There is an ongoing process for identifying, evaluating and
managing the risks faced by the Group. Major business risks
and their ﬁnancial implications are appraised by the responsible
executives as a part of the budget process and these are
endorsed by regional management. Key risks are reported to
the Board and the Audit Committee. The appropriateness of
controls is considered by the executives, having regard to
cost/beneﬁt, materiality and the likelihood of risks crystallising.
Key risks and actions to mitigate those risks are regularly
considered by the Board and are formally reviewed and
approved by the Board annually. 
Control environment
High standards of behaviour are demanded from staff at all
levels in the Group. The following procedures are in place to
support this:
• the induction process is used to educate new team
members on the standards required from them in their role,
Business Review Corporate Governance Financial Statements Shareholder Information Directors’ Report: Corporate Governance
Corporate governance continued
30_www.regus.com
including business ethics and compliance, regulations and
internal policies.
• all team members are provided with a copy of the “Team
Member Handbook” which contains detailed guidance on
employee policies and the standards of behaviour required
of staff.
• policies and procedures manuals and guidelines are readily
accessible through the Group’s intranet site.
• operational audit and self-certiﬁcation tools which require
individual centre managers to conﬁrm their adherence to
Group policies and procedures. 
To underpin the effectiveness of controls, it is the 
Group’s policy to recruit and develop appropriately skilled
management and staff of high calibre, integrity and with
appropriate disciplines. 
The Group has also established an externally hosted 
whistle-blowing channel to all staff to report issues and
concerns in conﬁdence. 
Control processes
The Company has had procedures in place throughout the
year and up to 22 March 2010, the date of approval of this
Annual Report, which accord with the Internal Control
Guidance for directors on the Combined Code. These 
include the following:
• The Board normally meets with regional executives every 
six months to carry out a wide-ranging review of Group and
regional ﬁnancial performance, business development
opportunities, Group infrastructure and general Group
management issues. 
• The annual budget process, is driven from senior
management meetings. Budgets are prepared at a detailed
level by business centre and roll-up at a country and
regional level. The executive directors review regional
budgets to ensure consistency with regional strategic
objectives, and the ﬁnal budget is reviewed and approved
by the Board. The approved budget forms the basis of
business management throughout the year. 
• Operational reports and ﬁnancial reports are prepared and
distributed to the Board on a monthly basis. Actual results
are reviewed against budget and forecast and explanations
are received for all material movements. 
• Key policies and control procedures (including ﬁnance,
operations, and health and safety) are documented in
manuals having Group-wide application. These are available
to all staff on the Group’s intranet system.
• The Board has formal procedures in place for the review
and approval of investment and acquisition projects. The
Group Investment Committee (comprising the executive
directors) review all investments prior to approval by the
Board. Additionally the form and content of investment
proposals is standardised to facilitate the review process. 
• The Group has clearly delegated authority limits with regard
to the approval of transactions. Purchase orders must be
obtained in advance for all purchases. 
• Numerous reports are generated from the Group’s sales and
operating systems on a daily, weekly and monthly basis to
provide management at all levels with performance data for
their area of responsibility which helps them to focus 
on operational issues that may require their input. 
Information and communications processes
The senior management team are integrally involved in the
business and to this extent regularly discuss and address
issues and opportunities with regional and functional teams.
Formal business review meetings, chaired by Mark Dixon, 
are held with the regional teams and functional heads on 
a monthly basis.
Regular staff communications include general information on
the business from senior management as well as operational
guidance on changes in policies and procedures. 
Sales staff and operational management periodically attend
regional sales or management conferences at which information
on operational issues is shared. Delegates present the key
messages to employees who did not attend the event. 
Monitoring effectiveness
The following key mechanisms were available to the Board 
at various times during the year in the conduct of its review 
of internal controls:
• Review of the Group’s monthly management accounts which
contain detailed analysis of ﬁnancial performance for the Group
and each of the Group’s geographic reporting segments. 
• An ongoing process of review, through Board meetings, senior
management meetings and divisional reviews as well as other
management meetings, for the formal identiﬁcation of
signiﬁcant operational risks and mitigating control processes. 
• Internal audit reviews of key risk areas. The ﬁndings and
recommendations of each review are reported to
management and the Audit Committee.
• Quarterly post-investment reviews are presented to the
Audit Committee to allow appraisal of the effectiveness 
of investment activity. 
• A bi-annual internal control self-assessment and
management certiﬁcation exercise covering the
effectiveness of ﬁnancial and operational controls. This is
based on a comprehensive internal control questionnaire
collated and reviewed by Internal Audit. Results and any
necessary mitigating action plans are presented to senior
management and the Audit Committee.
Other matters
Board Performance Evaluation
A formal evaluation of the performance of the Board, its
committees and individual directors is carried out annually by
means of detailed online questionnaires developed internally
using the Linstock Board Review Service. The aim is to ensure
continuous improvement in the functioning of the Board.
The 2009 evaluation results were presented to the Board
during December 2009 and were subsequently reviewed by
the Nomination Committee taking into account the views of
the executive directors. The senior independent non-
executive director reviewed the Chairman’s performance. 
Arising from the review carried out in 2009, the Board has
agreed to ongoing development in the following areas:
• Strategy planning at Board level; and
• Submission of information to the Board.  For more information visit
regus.com
Regus plc Annual Report and Accounts 2009_31
Training and resources 
Appropriate training is made available for all new directors to
assist them in the discharge of their responsibilities. Training
is provided on an ongoing basis to meet particular needs with
the emphasis on governance and accounting developments. 
During the year the Company Secretary, Tim Regan, provided
updates to the Board on relevant governance matters, whilst
the Audit Committee regularly considers new accounting
developments through presentations from management,
internal audit and the external auditors. The Board
programme includes presentations from management 
which, together with site visits, increases the non-executive
directors understanding of the business and sector. 
All directors have access to the advice and services of the
Company Secretary, who is responsible for ensuring that Board
procedures, corporate governance and regulatory compliance
are followed and complied with. Should a director request
independent professional advice to carry out his duties, such
advice is available to him at the Company’s expense.
Directors and Ofﬁcers Insurance
The Group’s insurance programme is reviewed annually 
and appropriate insurance cover is obtained to protect the
directors and senior management in the event of a claim
being brought against any of them in their capacity as
directors and ofﬁcers of the Company.
Dialogue with shareholders 
Regus reports formally to shareholders twice a year, with 
the interim results announced in August/September and 
the preliminary ﬁnal results announced normally in March.
There are programmes for the Chief Executive and Chief
Financial Ofﬁcer to give presentations of these results to 
the Company’s institutional investors, analysts and media in
London and other locations. The Chief Executive and Chief
Financial Ofﬁcer maintain a close dialogue with institutional
investors on the Company’s performance, governance, plans
and objectives. These meetings also serve to develop an
ongoing understanding of the views and any concerns of the
Company’s major shareholders. The non-executive directors
are given regular updates as to the views of the institutional
shareholders and the Chairman is available to meet with
these shareholders on request. The principal communication
with private shareholders is through the Annual Report, the
Interim Report and the AGM
The Company has engaged the services of Brunswick Group
plc as their Investor Relations adviser. 
AGM
The AGM will be held in May in Luxembourg and will be
attended, other than in exceptional circumstances, by all
members of the Board. In addition to the formal business 
of the meeting, there is normally a trading update and
shareholders are invited to ask questions and are given 
the opportunity to meet the directors informally afterwards. 
Notice of the AGM, together with any related documents are
mailed to shareholders at least 20 working days before the
meeting and separate resolutions are proposed on each
issue. The level of proxy votes cast and the balance for and
against each resolution, together with the level of abstentions,
if any, are announced to the meeting following voting by a
show of hands. Substantial resolutions of the shareholders
require a poll to be taken.
Financial and other information is made available on the
Company’s website www.regus.com.
Re-election of the Board 
All directors submit themselves for re-election by shareholders
at least every three years and directors appointed during the
period are required to seek re-election at the next AGM.
Non-executive directors are subject to the re-election
requirements and serve the Company under letters of
appointment, which have an initial three-year term.
Compliance statement
The Company has complied with the provisions set out in
section 1 of the Combined Code throughout the year ended
31 December 2009, with the exception of the following:
• Provision D.1.1 – The senior independent non-executive
director, Martin Robinson does not have regular meetings
with major external shareholders. 
The Board considers it appropriate for the Chairman to 
be the main conduit with investors, rather than the senior
independent non-executive director. The Chairman
participates in investor meetings and makes himself available
for questions, in person, at the time of major announcements.
The Chairman regularly updates the Board and particularly
the senior independent non-executive director on the results
of his meetings and the opinions of investors. On this basis,
Regus considers that the senior independent non-executive
director is able to gain full awareness of the issues and
concerns of major shareholders. Notwithstanding this policy,
all directors have a standing invitation to participate in
meetings with investors.

Statement of directors responsibilities 
in respect of the annual report and 
ﬁnancial statements
The directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report
and the Group and parent company ﬁnancial statements in
accordance with applicable law and regulations. 
Company law requires the directors to prepare Group and
parent company ﬁnancial statements for each ﬁnancial year.
Under that law they are required to prepare the Group
ﬁnancial statements in accordance with IFRSs as adopted 
by the EU and applicable law and have elected to prepare 
the parent company ﬁnancial statements in accordance with
Luxembourg Generally Accepted Accounting Practice and
applicable law. 
Under company law the directors must not approve the
ﬁnancial statements unless they are satisﬁed that they give 
a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the Group and
Company and their proﬁt or loss for the period. 
In preparing each of the Group and parent company ﬁnancial
statements, the directors are required to: 
• Select suitable accounting policies and then apply 
them consistently;
• Make judgements and estimates that are reasonable 
and prudent;
• For the Group ﬁnancial statements, state whether they have
been prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by 
the EU;
• For the parent company ﬁnancial statements, state whether
applicable Luxembourg accounting standards have been
followed, subject to any material departures disclosed and
explained in the parent company ﬁnancial statements; and
• Prepare the ﬁnancial statements on the going concern basis
unless it is inappropriate to presume that the parent
company and Group will continue in business.
The directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting
records that are sufﬁcient to show and explain the companies’
transactions and which disclose with reasonable accuracy at
any time the ﬁnancial position of the parent company and to
enable them to ensure that its ﬁnancial statements comply
with applicable law and regulations. They have general
responsibility for taking such steps as are reasonably open 
to them to safeguard the assets of the Group and to prevent
and detect fraud and other irregularities. 
Under applicable law and regulations, the directors are also
responsible for preparing a Directors’ Report, a Remuneration
Report and Corporate Governance Statement that comply
with that law and those regulations.
The directors are responsible for the maintenance and
integrity of the corporate and ﬁnancial information included
on the Company’s website. The legislation in the UK
governing the preparation and dissemination of ﬁnancial
statements may differ from legislation in other jurisdictions. 
Statutory statement as to disclosure
to auditors
The directors who held ofﬁce at the date of approval of this
Directors’ Report conﬁrm that:
• so far as they are aware, there is no relevant audit
information of which the Company’s auditor is unaware, and
• each director has taken all the steps that he ought to have
taken as a director in order to make himself aware of any
relevant audit information and to establish that the
Company’s auditor is aware of that information.
These annual accounts have been approved by the directors
of Regus plc. The directors conﬁrm that the annual accounts
have been prepared in accordance with applicable law and
regulations and that they include a fair review of the
development and performance of the business and the position
of the parent company and the undertakings included in the
consolidation taken as a whole, together with a description 
of the principal risks and uncertainties that they face.
We, the directors of the Company conﬁrm that to the best 
of our knowledge:
• the ﬁnancial statements prepared in accordance with the
applicable set of accounting standards, give a true and fair
view of the assets, liabilities, ﬁnancial position and proﬁt or
loss of the Company and the undertakings included in the
consolidation as a whole; and
• The Directors’ Report, including content contained by
reference, includes a fair review of the development and
performance of the business and the position of the Issuer
and the undertakings included in the consolidation taken as 
a whole, together with a description of the principal risks 
and uncertainties that they face.

Regus plc Annual Report and Accounts 2009_33
The report has been prepared by the Remuneration Committee
(the “Committee”) of Regus plc (société anonyme) (the
“Company”) and approved by the Company’s Board of
Directors (the “Board”). In preparing the report the Committee
has voluntarily complied with the relevant requirements of 
the UK Companies Act 2006. As required by the Large and
Medium-Sized Companies and Groups (Accounts & Reports)
Regulations 2008 (the “Regulations”), this Report will be
subject to an advisory shareholder vote at the Annual General
Meeting (“AGM”). The Report is intended to be in full compliance
with the requirements of the Regulations and the Combined
Code on Corporate Governance. 
This report sets out the Company’s policy on directors’
remuneration for the forthcoming year as well as information
on remuneration paid to directors during the year.
Information relating to the emoluments and pension contributions
to the directors, directors’ interests in the Company’s shares and
under Employee Share Plans is unaudited. 
Unaudited Information
Membership and responsibilities of the Committee 
The Committee is made up of non-executive directors and
chaired by Martin Robinson, the Company’s senior
independent non-executive director. During the year the
members of the Committee were:
• Martin Robinson
• Lance Browne
• Ulrich Ogiermann 
• Douglas Sutherland 
The Committee met seven times during the year.
The Committee has responsibility for determining, in
consultation with the Chairman and/or Chief Executive as
appropriate, the total remuneration package of each executive
director and senior manager, including bonuses, incentive
payments and share options or other share awards.
The Board has delegated to the Committee responsibility to:
• determine and agree with the Board the remuneration policy
for the executive directors and other senior management
positions within the Regus Group (the “Group”); and
• approve the design of, and determine targets for, any
performance related pay schemes operated by the
Company and approve the total annual payments made
under such schemes. 
The Committee received advice on executive remuneration
from CJW Remuneration Consultants (“CJW”), an external
consultancy which has wide experience of executive
remuneration in UK listed companies. CJW has no other
connection with the Company. 
Directors are not permitted, under the Company’s Articles 
of Association, to vote on their own terms and conditions 
of remuneration. 
The Committee’s terms of reference are available on the
Company’s website, www.regus.com. The members of the
Committee attend the Company’s Annual General Meeting
and are available to answer shareholders’ questions about
directors’ remuneration. 
Compliance with the best practice provisions
In accordance with the Board’s commitment to maintaining
high standards of Corporate Governance, the Committee has
complied with all remuneration related aspects of the Code
during the year. 
Remuneration policy 
The principal objectives of the Committee’s remuneration
policy are:
• to focus on rewarding exceptional pay for exceptional
performance: executives should be focused on delivering
exceptional returns to shareholders over both the short 
and long term and be given the opportunity to receive
exceptional levels of reward if such performance is
delivered. Conversely, if returns are conservative,
compensation levels should be extremely conservative. 
• to provide remuneration packages that will attract, retain
and motivate people of the highest calibre and experience
needed to shape and execute the Company’s strategy and
to deliver exceptional shareholder value. 
The guiding principles which the Committee has regard to
and balances, as far as practicable, in determining policy and
objectives for 2009 and future years are:
• to maintain a competitive package of total compensation,
commensurate with comparable packages available with
similar companies operating in similar markets (the
“Comparator Group”);
• to make a signiﬁcant percentage of potential maximum
reward conditional on short and long-term performance;
• to ensure that the interests of the executives are closely
aligned with those of the Company’s shareholders through
the provision of share based incentives;
• to link reward to the satisfaction of targeted objectives
which are the main drivers of shareholder value; and
• to be sensitive in determining executive directors’
remuneration to pay and employment conditions 
throughout the Group.
In order to achieve the above policy, and in light of market
conditions, the monthly living allowance provided to the 
Chief Executive Ofﬁcer was terminated in September 2009.
All other ﬁxed elements of the executives’ compensation
package for 2009 remained unchanged from 2008. 
This ensured a greater weighting towards variable
remuneration with the opportunity for total compensation
packages to be in the upper quartile within the Comparator
Group dependent upon the degree to which the associated
stringent performance conditions attached to the short and
long term incentive schemes had been satisﬁed.

and are in line with market rates. The non-executive directors
do not receive any pension or other beneﬁts, other than
appropriate expenses, nor do they participate in any bonus 
or share option schemes.

Remuneration packages 
The remuneration for executive directors during the year
comprised a basic salary, a beneﬁt package, and participation
in the Company’s share incentive arrangement, the Regus plc
Co-Investment Plan. 
Basic salary and beneﬁts 
The basic salaries of executive directors are reviewed
annually and any increases are effective from 1 January.
In light of current market conditions salaries for the 
Chief Executive Ofﬁcer and Chief Financial Ofﬁcer during
2010 will be unchanged from 2009, being £522,750 and
£300,000 respectively. 
Beneﬁts comprise a company car or allowance, fuel, private
medical insurance and a disturbance allowance, the Chief
Executive’s living allowance having ceased in September 2009.
Annual bonus scheme
The Committee believes ﬁrmly in the ﬁnancial effectiveness 
of short term incentives. Accordingly, incentive schemes are
widely used across the business.
The Committee sets bonus targets and eligibility each year. 
The maximum bonus potential, for the executive directors, 
for the year ending 31 December 2009 was 200% of salary,
consisting of a standard bonus and a discretionary bonus for
exceptional performance.
The Committee has determined that due to current market
conditions neither the ﬁnancial measures and targets relating 
to the standard bonus nor the exceptional level of performance
required for the discretionary bonus were achieved; as such 
no bonuses will be paid. 
For the year ending 31 December 2010 in consideration of
current market conditions, the Committee has decided that the
standard bonus will remain at a maximum of 100% of salary
linked to the achievement of stretching short term ﬁnancial and
individual performance targets, while the maximum discretional
element for exceptional out-performance will remain capped at
an additional 100%. The discretionary bonus will be based on
a self-ﬁnancing bonus “pool” system deﬁned by reference to a
percentage of operating proﬁts in excess of external forecasts
based on a consensus of analysts’ estimates. It is the intention
that the discretionary element of the bonus (if any) will be paid
half in cash and half deferred for a period of up to three years
and paid in the form of ordinary shares in the Company. 
Bonuses are non-pensionable. 
Non-executive directors do not receive a bonus. 
Pension beneﬁts
The executive directors participate in the Company’s Money
Purchase (Personal Pension) Scheme. The Company matches
contributions up to a maximum of 7.0% of basic salary. The
Committee considers that the pension beneﬁts of the executive
directors are low compared with comparative companies but
prefers to offer enhanced variable compensation (rather than 
a ﬁxed additional pension contribution).
The Group does not operate a deﬁned beneﬁt pension
scheme and has no plans to introduce such a scheme.
Long Term Incentives
Overview
The Company operates three long term incentive plans; the
Regus plc Co-investment Plan (“CIP”), the Regus plc Share
Option Scheme and the Regus plc 2008 Value Creation Plan
(the “VCP”). 
Co-investment plan 
There are two elements to the CIP:
The ﬁrst element operates in conjunction with the annual
bonus whereby a gross bonus of up to 50% of salary will be
taken as a deferred amount of shares (“Investment Shares”)
to be released at the end of a deﬁned period of not less than
three years, with the balance paid in cash. 
Awards of Matching Shares are linked to the number of
Investment Shares awarded and will vest depending on the
Company’s future performance (see overleaf). Matching
Shares are awarded at no cost to the participants. For more information visit
regus.com
Regus plc Annual Report and Accounts 2009_35
The maximum number of Matching Shares which can be
awarded to a participant in any calendar year under the CIP 
is 200% of salary. As such the maximum number of Matching
Shares which can be awarded based on Investment Shares
awarded is in the ratio of 4:1. 
Grants during the year ending 31 December 2009:
Mark Stephen 
Dixon Gleadle
CIP award face value 
(%age of salary) 200% 200%
Fair value* of CIP award £765,688 £439,419
Fair value of CIP award 
as a %age of Salary 146% 146%
* The fair value was calculated by taking the face value of the shares on the date 
of award and adjusting this value by the historic probability of performance
conditions being satisﬁed at this date (in accordance with the principles of IFRS 2).
As indicated in last year’s Remuneration Report, the
Committee felt it inappropriate to set speciﬁc performance
conditions for Matching Shares awarded in March 2008 and
March 2009 (details of awards to executive directors are set
out on pages 71 and 72 ) but were committed to carrying out
a thorough review of the matter during 2009. Following
external advice and discussions with the main institutional
shareholder committees it has been agreed that the following
conditions will apply to these awards:
• The total number of Matching Shares under the awards
made to each participant in 2008 and 2009 will be divided
into three separate equal amounts and will be subject to
future performance periods of three, four and ﬁve years
respectively. Thus, conditional on meeting the performance
targets, the ﬁrst amount will not vest until March 2013, the
second will not vest until March 2014 and the third will not
vest until March 2015 (subject to scaled down provisions for
“good leavers”). These vesting dates relate to the ﬁnancial
years ending on 31 December 2012, 31 December 2013
and 31 December 2014 respectively.
• The vesting of these awards will be subject to the
achievement of challenging corporate performance
conditions. 75% of each of the three amounts will be
subject to deﬁned Earnings per Share (“EPS”) targets over
the respective performance periods. The remaining 25% 
of each will be subject to relative Total Shareholder Return
(“TSR”) targets over the respective performance periods.
The EPS and TSR targets will be measured independently 
of each other. Details of the targets are as follows:
EPS targets (75% of each award):
Vesting Scale EPS targets years ending
2012 2013 2014
25% 15p 17p 18p
50% 16p 20p 22p 
75% 17p 23p 26p
100% 18p 26p 30p
Notes; 
(a) These targets represent approximate growth in EPS in the range of 270% –
550% compared to the EPS of 5.5p for the 2009 base year.
(b)None of these shares will vest in the respective year shown above unless the
minimum EPS target for that year is achieved.
(c) As in previous years the adjusted EPS is derived from basic EPS adjusted 
to take into account factors such as:
• a growth company such as Regus, costs are necessarily
incurred in one year to drive proﬁts in future years. As
such it is important to ensure management is not
encouraged to cut back on these investments to meet 
EPS targets in any one year. Accordingly, any such costs
incurred in the potential vesting year will be excluded 
from the EPS calculation;
• any one-off exceptional costs will also be excluded.
The Committee will retain the discretion to take into account
other factors in its determination of adjusted EPS. However,
when exercising its discretion, the Committee will ensure that
any such adjustments are made to reﬂect the underlying real
earnings of the Company and not for the beneﬁt of
participants in the CIP including the executive directors.
TSR targets (25% of each award):
Regus TSR % achieved relative to % of shares
FTSE All Share Total Return Index* vesting
100% Nil
Above 100% but below 101% 25%
For each complete 1% above 100% + 0.75%
200% or above 100%
* over three years’ performance. 
Note; The All Share index was considered the most appropriate relative 
measure, there being no obvious comparator group or sector that relates 
to the Company’s business.
• The awards of Matching Shares made in March 2007
(normal vesting date March 2010) failed to meet the 
related performance conditions and therefore lapse 
but the associated Investment Shares will be released 
to participants (subject to any tax liabilities) in accordance
with the Rules of the CIP (details of awards to executive
directors are set out on pages 71 and 72).
• No Investment Shares or Matching Shares are being
awarded in March 2010.
The second element of the CIP provides for the Committee to
make stand alone long term incentive awards (“LTIPs”) without
reference to annual bonus up to a maximum of 100% of
salary per calendar year. An LTIP is a conditional right over a
speciﬁed number of shares with the release being dependent
on the extent to which (if at all) the challenging performance
conditions set by the Committee at the time of the LTIP award
are satisﬁed. Having taken external advice and discussed the
matter with the main institutional shareholder committees, 
Business Review Corporate Governance Financial Statements Shareholder Information Directors’ Report: Corporate Governance
Remuneration report continued
36_www.regus.com
the Committee, against the background of the exceptionally
difﬁcult economic conditions during 2009, decided that it is
appropriate to make LTIP awards to the executive directors 
of up to 100% of salary in March 2010. However, the
performance conditions will mirror those set for the
outstanding 2008 and 2009 Matching Awards over a three
year performance period (normal vesting date March 2013
therefore) as follows:
EPS targets (75% of each award):
Vesting Scale EPS Target for year ending 2012
25% 15p
50% 16p
75% 17p
100% 18p
Notes; 
(a) The target represents approximate growth in EPS in the range of 270% – 330%
compared to the EPS of 5.5p for the 2009 base year.
(b)No shares will vest unless the minimum EPS target shown above is achieved.
(c) As per note (c) on page 35.
TSR targets (25% of each award):
Regus TSR % achieved relative % of shares 
to FTSE All Share Total Return Index* vesting

Above 100% but below 101% 25%
For each complete 1% above 100% + 0.75%

Note; The All Share index was considered the most appropriate relative 
measure, there being no obvious comparator group or sector that relates 
to the Company’s business.
Share Option Scheme 
The options granted to executive directors prior to the
introduction of the CIP are set out below. The Company
continues to grant options on an ad hoc basis to certain 
non-participants of the CIP .
Regus plc 2008 Value Creation Plan (the “VCP”) 
The VCP was introduced in 2008 with the objective of
delivering exceptional rewards to participants provided
absolute returns to shareholders are exceptional. 
The VCP operates over a 5 year period from May 2008 to
March 2013. Participants in the VCP are granted entitlements
(“VCP Entitlements”) to receive a maximum number of shares
which shall be earned by the conversion of the VCP
Entitlements into an option or series of options (the “VCP
Options”) which may be granted on certain dates (the
“Measurement Dates”) based on the Company’s share price
performance. The exercise price for VCP Options will be the
closing share price on the date of the Company’s 2008 AGM.
VCP Entitlements granted in 2008:
Mark Stephen 
Dixon Gleadle
Number of shares subject 
to VCP Entitlement* 3,500,000 3,000,000
* VCP Entitlements hold no value.
The share price of the Company will be calculated at each
Measurement Date the ﬁrst of which is 31st March 2010, and
compared against a matrix of extremely stretching ﬁxed share
price targets to determine the number of shares subject to 
the VCP Entitlement which a VCP Option will be granted over.
If a lower share price target is achieved a VCP Option shall be
granted over a lesser number of shares with the ability for the
balance to be received at a subsequent measurement date
subject to relevant share price targets being achieved.
The share price targets for the VCP Entitlements granted in
2008 are as set out in the following table:
Measurement date
31/03/10 31/03/11 31/03/12 31/03/13
Shares awarded less shares already awarded)
Share price is less than £2.60 –– – –
Share price is more than 
£2.60 but less than £3.50 2.5m 1.8m 1.2m 0.6m
Share price is more than 
£3.50 but less than £4.50 3.5m 2.5m 1.8m 1.2m
Share price is £4.50 or more – 3.5m 2.5m 1.8m
Total Shareholder Return (TSR)
The above graph shows the Company’s performance,
measured by TSR for the Group compared with the
performance of the FTSE 250 Index and the All Share Index.
The Committee consider the FTSE 250 Index relevant since 
it is an index of companies of similar size to the Company. As
detailed earlier in the report the Company considers its TSR
performance for share awards under the CIP in comparison 
to that of the All Share Index.
External appointments
As at 31 December 2009 the executive directors did not hold
any external positions for which they received fees. Executive
directors are permitted to accept appointments on external
boards or committees so long as these are not deemed to
interfere with the business of the Group. Any fees received 
in respect of these appointments would be retained directly
by the relevant executive director.

80% of the LTIP Awards granted on 3 November 2005 vested in March 2009 and 20% lapsed as a result of the failure 
to fully attain the related performance conditions attaching to the awards. The entitlement to the 2005 LTIP awards was 
subject to the achievement of performance conditions over a three year period as detailed in the 2008 Remuneration Report.
The performance period for the LTIP Awards was 3 November 2005 to 31 December 2008.
No LTIP Awards were granted during the year.

During the year the CIP Investment Shares awarded in March 2006 were released. In addition, 80% of the CIP Matching
Shares awarded in 2006 vested and 20% lapsed as a result of a failure to fully attain the related performance conditions
attaching to the awards. This was detailed in the 2008 Remuneration Report. All of the Matching Shares awarded in March
2007 (normal vesting date March 2010) failed to meet the related performance conditions and therefore lapsed. 
The performance period for the CIP Matching Share Awards granted in 2009 are set out in the CIP section on page 35. 
The entitlement to Matching Shares under the CIP is subject to achieving the performance conditions referred to in the 
CIP section on page 35.
The market price of the Company’s ordinary shares at 31 December 2009 was 91.5p and the range during the year was 
45.0p to 119.3p.
None of the directors had a beneﬁcial interest in any contract of any signiﬁcance in relation to the business of the Company 
or its subsidiaries at any time during the ﬁnancial year.
Annual resolution
Shareholders will be given the opportunity to approve the Remuneration Report at the AGM on 18 May 2010.
Audit requirement 
Under Luxembourg law and regulations there is no requirement for the sections on directors’ remuneration, shareholdings and
pension beneﬁts on pages 37 to 39 inclusive to be audited; therefore all sections of the Remuneration Report are un-audited.

We have audited the consolidated ﬁnancial statements of
Regus plc S.A., which comprise the consolidated balance
sheet as at December 31, 2009 and the consolidated income
statement, consolidated statement of changes in equity and
consolidated cash ﬂow statement for the year then ended,
and a summary of signiﬁcant accounting policies and other
explanatory notes as set out on pages 41 to 84.
Board of Directors’ responsibility for the consolidated 
ﬁnancial statements
The Board of Directors is responsible for the preparation and
fair presentation of these consolidated ﬁnancial statements in
accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards
as adopted by the European Union. This responsibility
includes: designing, implementing and maintaining internal
control relevant to the preparation and fair presentation of
consolidated ﬁnancial statements that are free from material
misstatement, whether due to fraud or error; selecting and
applying appropriate accounting policies; and making
accounting estimates that are reasonable in the circumstances.
Responsibility of the Réviseur d’Entreprises
Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these
consolidated ﬁnancial statements based on our audit. 
We conducted our audit in accordance with International
Standards on Auditing as adopted by the Institut des Réviseurs
d’Entreprises. Those standards require that we comply with
ethical requirements and plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance whether the consolidated ﬁnancial
statements are free from material misstatement.
An audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit
evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the
consolidated ﬁnancial statements. The procedures selected
depend on the judgement of the Réviseur d’Entreprises,
including the assessment of the risks of material misstatement
of the consolidated ﬁnancial statements, whether due to 
fraud or error. In making those risk assessments, the Réviseur
d’Entreprises considers internal control relevant to the entity’s
preparation and fair presentation of the consolidated ﬁnancial
statements in order to design audit procedures that are
appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose 
of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the entity’s
internal control. An audit also includes evaluating the
appropriateness of accounting policies used and the
reasonableness of accounting estimates made by the Board 
of Directors, as well as evaluating the overall presentation 
of the consolidated ﬁnancial statements. 
We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained 
is sufﬁcient and appropriate to provide a basis for our 
audit opinion.
Opinion
In our opinion, the consolidated ﬁnancial statements 
set out on pages 41 to 84 give a true and fair view 
of the consolidated ﬁnancial position of Regus plc S.A. 
as of December 31, 2009, and of its consolidated ﬁnancial
performance and its consolidated cash ﬂows for the year 
then ended in accordance with International Financial
Reporting Standards as adopted by the European Union.
Report on other legal and regulatory requirements 
The consolidated Directors’ report, which is the responsibility
of the Board of Directors, is consistent with the consolidated
ﬁnancial statements.

(a) Total reserves attributable to equity holders of the parent 
• Share capital represents the net proceeds (the nominal value) on the issue of the Company’s equity share capital (and prior to 14 October 2008 the equity share capital of 
Regus Group plc). 
• At 31 December 2009 Treasury shares represent 1,576,498 ordinary shares of the Group that were acquired for the purposes of the Group’s employee share option plans 
and the share buyback programme. During the period, 627,258 shares were purchased in the open market and an additional 4,373,502 of treasury shares held by the 
Group were utili ed to satisfy the exercise of share awards by employees. As at 22 March 2010, 1,076,498 treasury shares were held. 
• The foreign currency translation reserve is used to record exchange differences arising from the translation of the financial statements of foreign subsidiaries and 
joint ventures.  
• The revaluation reserve arose on the restatement of the assets and liabilities of the UK associate from historic cost to fair value at the time of the acquisition of the 
outstanding 58% interest on 19 April 2006. The increase of £0.5 million in the historic cost to fair value arises at the time of the acquisition of the remaining 50% interest  
in REBC on 31 December 2009. 
• Other reserves include £37.9 million arising from the Scheme of Arrangement undertaken on 14 October 2008, £6.5 million relating to merger reserves and £0.1 million  
to the redemption of preference shares partly offset by £29.2 million arising from the Scheme of Arrangement undertaken in 2003. 
(b) On 14 October 2008, the Group entered into a Court approved Scheme of Arrangement. As a result of the Scheme of Arrangement shares in Regus Group plc were cancelled 
and shares in the new Group holding company, Regus plc, were issued on the basis of one Regus plc share (nominal value one pence) for one share previously held in Regus 
Group plc (nominal value five pence). As a result the shareholders of Regus Group plc became the shareholders of Regus plc. The transaction was accounted for as a reverse 
acquisition and consequently the aggregate of the Group reserves have been attributed to Regus plc.

Regus plc Annual Report and Accounts 2009_45
Shareholder Information Financial Statements Corporate Governance Business Review 
1. Authorisation of financial statements 
The Group and Company financial statements for the year ended 
31 December 2009 were authorised for issue by the Board of 
directors on 22 March 2010 and the balance sheets were signed on 
the Board’s behalf by Mark Dixon and Stephen Gleadle. Regus plc 
S.A. is a public limited company incorporated in Jersey and 
registered and domiciled in Luxembourg. The Company’s ordinary 
shares are traded on the London Stock Exchange. 
The Group financial statements have been prepared and approved 
by the directors in accordance with International Financial Reporting 
Standards as adopted by the EU (“Adopted IFRSs”). The Company 
is required to prepare its parent company financial statements in 
accordance with Luxembourg GAAP; extracts from these are 
presented on page 85. 
2. Accounting policies 
Basis of preparation 
The Group financial statements consolidate those of the parent 
company and its subsidiaries (together referred to as the “Group”) 
and equity account the Group’s interest in the associate and jointly 
controlled entities. The extract from the parent company financial 
statements presents information about the Company as a separate 
entity and not about its Group. 
The accounting policies set out below have, unless otherwise 
stated, been applied consistently to all periods presented in these 
Group financial statements. Amendments to adopted IFRSs issued 
by the International Accounting Standards Board (“IASB”) and the 
International Financial Reporting Interpretations Committee (“IFRIC”) 
with an effective date from 1 January 2009 did not have a material 
effect on the Group financial statements. 
• IFRS 8 “Operating Segments” requires that operating segments 
are determined and presented based on the information that is 
presented internally to the Board (the chief operating decision 
maker of the Group). Previously operating segments were 
determined and presented in accordance with IAS 14 “Segment 
Reporting”. Details of the basis on which the operating segments 
have been determined and presented are included in note 3 to 
the notes to the accounts. Comparative information has been  
re-presented in line with the transitional requirements of IFRS 8. 
The change in accounting policy only impacts the disclosure  
of segmental information and therefore has no impact on the 
financial results or position of the Group. 
• Amendments to IAS 1 “Presentation of Financial Statements 
(2007)’’ requires that all owner changes in equity are presented  
in the consolidated statement of changes in equity and all non-
owner changes in equity are presented in the consolidated 
statement of comprehensive income. This presentation has  
been applied as at and for the year ended 31 December 2009. 
Comparative information has been re-presented in line with  
the requirements of the revised standard. As the change in 
accounting policy only impacts disclosure aspects there is  
no impact on the financial results or position of the Group. 
• The adoption of other amendments that were effective for the year 
beginning 1 January 2009, including the amendment to IFRS 2 
“Share-Based Payment: – Vesting Conditions and Cancellations”; 
amendment to IFRS 7 “Financial Instruments and Disclosures – 
Improving Disclosures about Financial Instruments” and 
amendments to IAS 39 “Financial Instruments: Recognition  
and Measurement”, did not have a material impact on the 
financial statements. 
Judgements made by the directors in the application of these 
accounting policies that have significant effect on the financial 
statements and estimates with a significant risk of material 
adjustment in the next year are discussed in note 31. 
The financial statements are prepared on a historical cost basis, 
with the exception of certain financial assets and liabilities that  
are measured at fair value.  
The directors, having made appropriate enquiries, have a 
reasonable expectation that the Group and the Company have 
adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the 
foreseeable future. For this reason they continue to adopt the going 
concern basis in preparing the Accounts on pages 41 to 86. 
In adopting the going concern basis for preparing the financial 
statements, the directors have considered the further information 
included in the business activities commentary as set out on 
pages 12 to 15 as well as the Group’s principal risks and 
uncertainties as set out on pages 28 to 30.  
Further details on the going concern basis of preparation can  
be found in note 23 to the notes to the accounts on page 66. 
The Group and Company financial statements are presented in 
Pounds Sterling and all values are in million pounds, rounded to  
one decimal place, except where indicated otherwise. 
The attributable results of those companies acquired or disposed  
of during the year are included for the periods of ownership. 
Associates are those entities in which the Group has significant 
influence, but not control, over the financial and operating policies.  
The consolidated financial statements include the Group’s share of  
the total recognised income and expense of associates on an equity 
accounted basis, from the date that significant influence commences 
until the date that significant influence ceases or the associate qualifies 
as a disposal group at which point the investment is carried at the lower 
of fair value less costs to sell and carrying value.  
Joint ventures include jointly controlled entities that are those 
entities over whose activities the Group has joint control, 
established by contractual agreement. The consolidated financial 
statements include the Group’s share of the total recognised gains 
and losses of jointly controlled entities on an equity accounted 
basis, from the date that joint control commences until the date  
that joint control ceases or the jointly controlled entity qualifies as  
a disposal group at which point the investment is carried at the 
lower of fair value less costs to sell and carrying value.  
When the Group’s share of losses exceeds its interest in a joint 
venture, the Group’s carrying amount is reduced to nil and 
recognition of further losses is discontinued except to the extent 
that the Group has incurred legal or constructive obligations or 
made payments on behalf of a joint venture.  Notes to the accounts continued

Financial Statements 
2. Accounting policies continued 
On 19 April 2006 the Group acquired the remaining 58% of the 
shares of the UK business that were not already owned by the 
Group. As a result the Group fully consolidated the UK business 
from that date. The acquisition was accounted for through the 
purchase method and as a consequence the entire assets and 
liabilities of the UK business were revalued to fair value. The effect  
of these adjustments on the 42% of the UK business already 
owned was reflected in the revaluation reserve. 
On 14 October 2008, Regus plc acquired the entire share capital  
of Regus Group plc in exchange for the issue of new shares of 
Regus plc on the basis of one share in Regus plc for one share held 
previously in Regus Group plc. At the date of the transaction, Regus 
plc had nominal assets and liabilities and therefore the transaction 
was accounted for as a reverse acquisition of Regus plc by Regus 
Group plc. Consequently no fair value acquisition adjustments were 
required and the aggregate of the Group reserves have been 
attributed to Regus plc. 
Goodwill 
All business combinations are accounted for using the purchase 
method. Goodwill represents the difference between the cost of 
acquisition over the share of the fair value of identifiable assets  
(including intangible assets), liabilities and contingent liabilities of a 
subsidiary, associate or jointly controlled entity at the date of acquisition. 
Business combinations that took place prior to the Group’s transition 
date to IFRS on 1 January 2004 have not been restated under the 
requirements of IFRS. 
Positive goodwill is stated at cost less any provision for impairment 
in value. An impairment test is carried out annually and, in addition, 
whenever indicators exist that the carrying amount may not be 
recoverable. Positive goodwill is allocated to cash generating units 
for the purpose of impairment testing.  
Adopted IFRSs not yet applied 
The Group did not adopt the following standards, interpretations 
and amendments to standards which were available for optional 
early adoption and relevant to the Group: 
• IFRS 3 (Revised) “Business Combinations” is applicable for 
accounting periods commencing on or after 1 January 2010.  
The Standard requires a number of changes to be made to the 
accounting for business combinations. These includes changes  
in the way in which fair value adjustments are reflected in the 
financial statements for acquisitions that are completed in stages. 
In addition, acquisition costs paid to third parties other than the 
seller in the business acquisition must be expensed and can  
no longer be included within goodwill. The impact of IFRS 3 
(Revised) will depend on the number and nature of future 
business combinations although it is not expected to have  
a material impact on the Group’s financial statements. 
• Improvements to IFRS (2009) contains 15 amendments that 
result in accounting changes for presentation, recognition or 
measurement purposes. 
The adoption of any of the above standards or amendments to 
standards is not expected to have a material impact on the Group’s 
financial statements. 
The Group will be adopting the above standards or amendments  
at the year ended 31 December 2010. 
Basis of consolidation 
Subsidiaries are entities controlled by the Group. Control exists 
when the Group has the power, directly or indirectly, to govern the 
financial and operating policies of an entity so as to obtain benefits 
from its activities. In assessing control, potential voting rights that 
are currently exercisable or convertible are taken into account. The 
financial statements of subsidiaries are included in the consolidated 
financial statements from the date that control commences.  
The results are consolidated until the date control ceases or the 
subsidiary qualifies as a disposal group at which point the assets 
and liabilities are carried at the lower of fair value less costs to sell 
and carrying value. 
Impairment 
The carrying amounts of the Group’s assets other than deferred  
tax assets, are reviewed at each balance sheet date to determine 
whether there is any indication of impairment. If any such indication 
exists, the asset’s recoverable amount is estimated. 
For goodwill, and intangible assets that have an indefinite useful  
life and intangible assets that are not yet available for use, the 
recoverable amount was estimated at 31 October 2009 and 
updated in February 2010. 
An impairment loss is recognised whenever the carrying amount  
of an asset or its cash generating unit exceeds its recoverable amount. 
Impairment losses are recognised in the income statement. 
Impairment losses recognised in respect of cash generating units 
are allocated first to reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill 
allocated to the cash generating unit and then to reduce the 
carrying amount of the other assets in the unit on a pro rata basis.  
A cash generating unit is the smallest identifiable group of assets 
that generates cash inflows that are largely independent of the  
cash inflows from other assets or groups of assets. 
Calculation of recoverable amount 
The recoverable amount of relevant assets is the greater of their fair 
value less costs to sell and value in use. In assessing value in use, 
the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present 
value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market 
assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to 
the asset. For an asset that does not generate largely independent 
cash inflows, the recoverable amount is determined for the cash 
generating unit to which the asset belongs. 
Intangible assets 
Intangible assets acquired separately from the business are capitalised 
at cost. Intangible assets acquired as part of an acquisition of a 
business are capitalised separately from goodwill if their fair value  
can be identified and measured reliably on initial recognition.  For more information visit

Regus plc Annual Report and Accounts 2009_47
Shareholder Information Financial Statements Corporate Governance Business Review 
Intangible assets are amortised on a straight-line basis over the 
estimated useful life of the assets as follows: 
Brand – Regus brand Indefinite life
Brand – Other acquired brands 20 years
Computer software 3 – 5 years
Customer lists 1 – 2 years*
Management agreements Minimum duration of the contract
* Customer lists recognised on the acquisition of the remaining 58% interest in the UK 
business are amortised over four years. 
Amortisation of intangible assets is expensed through administration 
expenses in the income statement. 
Leases 
Plant and equipment leases for which the Group assumes 
substantially all of the risks and rewards of ownership are classified 
as finance leases. All other leases, including all of the Group’s 
property leases are categorised as operating leases. 
Finance leases 
Plant and equipment acquired by way of a finance lease is 
capitalised at the commencement of the lease at the lower of its  
fair value and the present value of the minimum lease payments  
at inception. Future payments under finance leases are included  
in creditors, net of any future finance charges. Minimum lease 
payments are apportioned between the finance charge and the 
reduction of the outstanding liability. Finance charges are 
recognised in the income statement over the lease term so as  
to produce a constant periodic rate of interest on the remaining 
balance of the liability. 
Operating leases 
Minimum lease payments under operating leases are recognised  
in the income statement on a straight-line basis over the lease  
term. Lease incentives and rent free periods are included in the 
calculation of minimum lease payments. The commencement of the 
lease term is the date from which the Group is entitled to use the 
leased asset. The lease term is the non-cancellable period of the 
lease, together with any further periods for which the Group has  
the option to continue to lease the asset and when at the inception 
of the lease it is reasonably certain that the Group will exercise  
that option. 
Contingent rentals include rent increases based on future inflation 
indices or non-guaranteed rental payments based on centre 
turnover or profitability and are excluded from the calculation of 
minimum lease payments. Contingent rentals are recognised  
in the income statement as they are incurred. 
Onerous lease provisions are an estimate of the net amounts 
payable under the terms of the lease to the first break point, 
discounted at an appropriate weighted average cost of capital. 
Exceptional Items 
Exceptional items are those significant items which are separately 
disclosed by virtue of their size or incidence to enable a full 
understanding of the Group’s financial performance. Such items are 
included within the income statement caption to which they relate, 
and are separately disclosed either in the notes to the consolidated 
financial statements or on the face of the consolidated income 
statement. Transactions which may give rise to exceptional items 
are principally restructuring and litigation settlements. 
Property, plant and equipment 
Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated 
depreciation and any impairment in value. Depreciation is calculated 
on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life of the assets  
as follows: 
Fixtures and fittings 
Over the shorter of the 
lease term and 10 years
Furniture 10 years
Office equipment and telephones 5 – 10 years
Motor vehicles 4 years
Computer hardware 3 – 5 years
Revenue 
Revenue from the provision of services to customers is measured  
at the fair value of consideration received or receivable (excluding 
sales taxes). 
Workstations 
Workstation revenue is recognised when the provision of the  
service is rendered. Amounts invoiced in advance are deferred  
and recognised as revenue upon provision of the service. 
Customer service income 
Service income (including the rental of meeting rooms) is recognised 
as services are rendered. In circumstances where Regus acts as an 
agent for the sale and purchase of goods to customers, only the 
commission fee earned is recognised as revenue. 
Management and franchise fees 
Fees received for the provision of initial and subsequent services are 
recognised as revenue as the services are rendered. Fees charged 
for the use of continuing rights granted by the agreement, or for 
other services provided during the period of the agreement, are 
recognised as revenue as the services are provided or the  
rights used. 
Membership card income 
Revenue from the sale of membership cards is deferred and 
recognised over the period that the benefits of the membership 
card are expected to be provided. 
These categories represent all material sources of revenue earned 
from the provision of global workplace solutions.

2. Accounting policies continued 
Employee benefits 
The Group’s contributions to defined contribution plans and other 
paid and unpaid benefits earned by employees are charged to the 
income statement as incurred  
Share based payments 
The share option programme entitles certain employees and 
directors to acquire shares of the ultimate parent company;  
these awards are granted by the ultimate parent. 
The fair value of options granted is recognised as an employee expense 
with a corresponding increase in equity. The fair value is measured at 
grant date and spread over the period during which the employees 
become unconditionally entitled to the options. The fair value of the 
options granted is measured using the Black-Scholes valuation model 
or the Monte Carlo method, taking into account the terms and 
conditions upon which the options were granted. 
The amount recognised as an expense is adjusted to reflect the 
actual number of share options that vest except where forfeiture  
is due only to share prices not achieving the threshold for vesting. 
Share appreciation rights (CIP) are also granted by the Company  
to certain employees. The fair value of the amount payable to the 
employee is recognised as an expense with a corresponding 
increase in equity. The fair value is initially recognised at grant date 
and spread over the period during which the employees become 
unconditionally entitled to payment. The fair value of the share 
appreciation rights is measured based on the Monte Carlo valuation 
model, taking into account the terms and conditions upon which 
the instruments were granted.  
The Group also operates a Value Creation Plan which awards 
entitlements to certain employees and directors of the Group. 
These entitlements are convertible into options over ordinary shares 
subject to the Group’s share price reaching certain targets. The fair 
value of the amount payable to the employee is recognised as an 
expense with a corresponding increase in equity. The fair value is 
initially recognised at the date of the award of the entitlements and 
spread over the period during which the entitlements are convertible 
into ordinary shares. The fair value of the entitlements is based on 
the Monte Carlo valuation model, taking into account the terms and 
conditions upon which the instruments were granted. 
Taxation 
Tax on the profit for the year comprises current and deferred tax. 
Tax is recognised in the income statement except to the extent that 
it relates to items recognised directly in equity, in which case it is 
recognised in equity. 
Current tax is the expected tax payable on the taxable income for 
the year, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the 
balance sheet date, and any adjustment to tax payable in respect  
of previous years. 
Deferred tax is provided on temporary differences between the carrying 
amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the 
amounts used for taxation purposes. The following temporary 
differences are not provided for: the initial recognition of goodwill; the 
initial recognition of assets and liabilities that affect neither accounting 
nor taxable profit other than in a business combination; and differences 
relating to investments in subsidiaries to the extent that they will 
probably not reverse in the foreseeable future. The amount of deferred 
tax provided is based on the expected manner of realisation or 
settlement of the carrying amount of assets and liabilities, using tax 
rates enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date. 
A deferred tax asset is recognised only to the extent that it is 
probable that future taxable profits will be available against which 
the asset can be utilised. 
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally 
enforceable right to set off current tax assets against current tax 
liabilities and when they relate to income taxes levied by the same 
taxation authority and the Group intends to settle its current tax 
assets and liabilities on a net basis. 
Provisions 
A provision is recognised in the balance sheet when the Group has 
a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of a past event 
that can be estimated reliably, and it is probable that an outflow of 
economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation. 
Restructuring provisions are made for direct expenditures of a 
business reorganisation where the plans are sufficiently detailed  
and well advanced and where the appropriate communication to 
those affected has been undertaken at the balance sheet date. 
Provision is made for onerous contracts to the extent that the 
unavoidable costs of meeting the obligations under a contract 
exceed the economic benefits expected to be delivered, discounted 
using an appropriate weighted average cost of capital. 
Finance charges 
Interest charges and income are accounted for in the income 
statement on an accruals basis. Financing transaction costs that 
relate to financial liabilities are charged to interest expense using the 
effective interest rate method and are recognised within the carrying 
value of the related financial liability on the balance sheet. Fees  
paid for the arrangement of credit facilities are recognised as a 
prepayment and recognised through the finance expense over the 
term of the facility. In the event of a facility being drawn the relevant 
unamortised portion of the fee is recognised within the carrying 
value of the financial liability and charged to the interest expense 
using the effective interest rate method. 
Where assets or liabilities on the Group balance sheet are carried at 
net present value, the increase in the amount due to unwinding the 
discount is recognised as a finance expense or finance income  
as appropriate. 
Interest bearing borrowings and other financial liabilities  
Financial liabilities, including interest bearing borrowings, are 
recognised initially at fair value less attributable transaction costs. 
Subsequent to initial recognition, financial liabilities are stated at 
amortised cost with any difference between cost and redemption 
value being recognised in the income statement over the period  
of the borrowings on an effective interest basis.  For more information visit

Regus plc Annual Report and Accounts 2009_49
Shareholder Information Financial Statements Corporate Governance Business Review 
The Group derecognises financial liabilities when the Group’s 
obligations are discharged, cancelled or expire. 
Financial liabilities are classified as financial liabilities at fair value through 
profit or loss where the liability is either held for trading or is designated 
as held at fair value through profit or loss on initial recognition. Financial 
liabilities at fair value through profit or loss are stated at fair value with 
any resultant gain or loss recognised in the income statement. 
Financial assets 
Financial assets are classified as either at fair value through profit or 
loss, held to maturity investments, available for sale financial assets or 
loans and receivables. The classification depends on the nature and 
purpose of the financial assets and is determined on initial recognition. 
Trade and other receivables that have fixed or determinable 
payments that are not quoted in an active market are classified as 
loans and receivables. Loans and receivables are measured at 
amortised cost using the effective interest rate method, less any 
impairment. Interest income is recognised by applying the effective 
interest rate, except for short term receivables when recognition 
would be immaterial. 
Liquid investments compose held to maturity bonds and deposits. 
Foreign currencies 
Transactions in foreign currencies are recorded using the rate of 
exchange ruling at the date of the transaction. Monetary assets and 
liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated using the 
closing rate of exchange at the balance sheet date and the gains or 
losses on translation are taken to the income statement. Non-monetary 
assets and liabilities that are measured in terms of historical cost in a 
foreign currency are translated using the exchange rate at the date of 
the transaction. The results and cash flows of overseas operations are 
translated using the average rate for the period. Assets and liabilities, 
including goodwill and fair value adjustments, of overseas operations 
are translated using the closing rate with all exchange differences arising 
on consolidation being recognised in the foreign currency translation 
reserve. Exchange differences are released to the income statement  
on disposal. Under the transition requirements of IFRS, cumulative 
translation differences for all foreign operations have been set to  
zero at 1 January 2004. 
Cash and cash equivalents 
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash at bank and in hand  
and are subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value. 
Derivative financial instruments 
The Group’s policy on the use of derivative financial instruments can 
be found in note 23. Derivative financial instruments are measured 
initially at fair value and changes in the fair value are recognised 
through profit or loss unless the derivative financial instrument has 
been designated as a cash flow hedge whereby the effective 
portion of changes in the fair value are deferred in equity.

3. Segmental analysis – statutory basis 
The Group has implemented IFRS 8 “Operating Segments” with 
effect from 1 January 2009. There are no changes in the operating 
segments presented, however this has resulted in a change to the 
segmental information reported. Comparative information has been 
presented on a consistent basis. 
An operating segment is a component of the Group that engages  
in business activities from which it may earn revenues and incur 
expenses, including those that relate to transactions with other 
operating segments. An operating segment’s results are reviewed 
regularly by the chief operating decision maker (the Board of 
Directors of the Group) to make decisions about resources to  
be allocated to the segment and assess its performance, and  
for which discrete financial information is available. 
The business is run on a worldwide basis but managed through 
four principal geographical segments; Americas; Europe, Middle 
East and Africa (EMEA); Asia Pacific; and the United Kingdom. The 
United Kingdom segment does not include the Group’s non-trading 
holding and corporate management companies that are based  
in the UK and the EMEA segment does not include the Group’s 
non-trading head office and holding companies that are based  
in Luxembourg. The results of business centres in each of these 
regions form the basis for reporting geographical results to the chief 
operating decision maker. All reportable segments are involved in 
the provision of global workplace solutions. 
The Group’s reportable segments operate in different markets  
and are managed separately because of the different economic 
characteristics that exist in each of those markets. Each reportable 
segment has its own discrete senior management team responsible 
for the performance of the segment. 
The accounting policies of the operating segments are the same as 
those described in the Annual Report and Accounts for Regus plc 
for the year ended 31 December 2009. The performance of each 
segment is assessed on the basis of the segment operating profit 
which excludes certain non-recurring items (including provisions for 
onerous contracts and asset write-downs), exceptional gains and 
losses, internal management charges and foreign exchange gains 
and losses arising on transactions with other operating segments.

Shareholder Information Financial Statements Corporate Governance Business Review 
In the prior year the Group had non-recurring items of £7.2 million, including the exceptional item of £4.8 million set out in note 6. On review 
the Group no longer considers £2.4 million of these costs to be non-recurring given the nature of the onerous lease and severance charges 
to which they pertain. The 2009 exceptional charge of £2.6 million is split between the reportable segments and central costs. As set out in 
note 6, it constitutes part of a formal restructuring plan and therefore, in the Group’s view is differentiated from other on-going charges 
within the operations of the business.

4. Segmental analysis – entity-wide disclosures 
The Group’s primary activity and only business segment is the provision of global workplace solutions and therefore all revenue is attributed 
to a single group of similar products and services. It is not meaningful to separate this group into further categories of products. 
The Group has a diversified customer base and no single customer contributes a material percentage of the Group’s revenue. 
The Group’s revenue from external customers and non-current assets analysed by foreign country is as follows:

During the year ended 31 December 2009 the Group received a net amount of £18.3 million in relation to the settlement of a dispute with  
a supplier. The amount represents the cash received in settlement of the dispute less the directly attributable costs associated with the 
successful outcome of the negotiations.  
In December 2009 the Group initiated a new restructuring plan to develop and accelerate the actions which had commenced in 2009 
focused on the simplification and rationalisation of the sales and back office processes and to address the parts of the Regus network not 
generating a sufficient level of profitability. In the year ended 31 December 2009, charges of £2.6 million were recognised in relation to the 
delivery of Phase 1 and Phase 2 of the restructuring plan.  
The above items have been reported as exceptional items and are disclosed separately as they are relevant to the understanding of the

The applicable tax rate is determined based on the tax rate in Luxembourg which was the effective tax rate applicable in the country of 
domicile of the parent company of the Group for the financial year. 
The tax rate in the UK reduced from 30.0% to 28.0% on 1 April 2008 and the reconciliation for 2008 has been included at the effective UK 
rate for the year of 28.5%. From 14 October 2008, when the parent company of the Group became Regus plc, the country of domicile 
became Luxembourg and the reconciliation has therefore been prepared using the rate applicable to that country. For more information visit

Deferred tax assets recognised on short term temporary differences consist predominantly of provisions deductible when paid and share 
based payments. Deferred tax assets have been recognised in excess of deferred tax liabilities on the basis that there are forecast taxable 
profits in the entities concerned. 
At the balance sheet date, the temporary difference arising from unremitted earnings of overseas subsidiaries was £46.6 million (2008: 
£50.2 million). The only tax that would arise on these reserves would be non-creditable withholding tax.  For more information visit

12.  Goodwill continued 
Cash generating units (“CGUs”), comprising individual business centres, are grouped by country of operation for the purpose of carrying 
out impairment reviews of non-current assets as this is the lowest level at which goodwill can be assessed. Goodwill acquired through 
business combinations is held at a country level and is subject to impairment reviews based on the cash flows of these CGUs. 
The goodwill attributable to the reportable business segments is as follows: 
 
2009
£m
2008
£m
Carrying amount of goodwill included within the Americas business segment 153.2 168.6 
Carrying amount of goodwill included within the EMEA business segment 5.4 5.0 
Carrying amount of goodwill included within the Asia Pacific business segment 10.2 10.6 
Carrying amount of goodwill included within the UK business segment 90.3 90.3 
 259.1 274.5 
The carrying value of goodwill and indefinite life intangibles allocated to two CGUs, the USA and UK, is material relative to the total carrying 
value comprising 90% of the total. The remaining 10% of the carrying value is allocated to a further 23 countries (23 cash generating units). 
The goodwill and indefinite life intangibles allocated to the USA and the UK cash generating units is set out below:

Other cash generating units 27.9 –  27.9 28.1 
 259.1 11.2  270.3 285.7 
The indefinite lived intangible asset relates to the brand value arising from the acquisition of the remaining 58% of the UK business in the 
year ended 31 December 2006 (see note 13). 
The recoverable amount of each of the CGUs above has been determined based on their value in use, calculated as the present value of 
future cash flows attributable to the unit 
The value in use for each CGU has been determined using a model which derives the individual value in use for each unit from the value in 
use of the Group as a whole. Although the model includes budgets and forecasts prepared by management it also reflects external factors, 
such as capital market risk pricing as reflected in the market capitalisation of the Group and prevailing tax rates, which have been used to 
determine the risk-adjusted discount rate for the Group. While management believe that the projected cash flows are a reasonable 
reflection of the likely outcomes over the medium to long term, in the event that trading conditions deteriorate beyond the assumptions 
used in the projected cashflows, it is also possible that impairment charges could arise in future periods. 
The following key assumptions have been used in calculating value in use for each group of CGUs:  
• Future cash flows are based on budgets for 2010 approved by the Board and identified for each CGU. The model excludes cost savings 
and restructurings that are anticipated but had not been committed to at the date of the determination of the value in use. Thereafter 
forecasts have been prepared by management for a further four years from 2011 that reflect an annual growth rate of 3 - 5.5% and a 
modest increase in gross margins driven by improving global economic conditions from 2011. This compared to forecasts used in the 
evaluation in the year ended 31 December 2008 that projected 3% growth but reflected a higher level of baseline cash flows.  
• These forecasts exclude the impact of both organic and acquisitive growth expected to take place in future periods. As a result gross 
margins and real operating profits at the end of the five year period remain either at or below the levels achieved in the year ended  
31 December 2008. Management consider these projections to be a reasonable projection of margins expected at the mid-cycle 
position reflecting the current uncertain global economic conditions. Cash flows beyond 2014 have been extrapolated using a 2% 
growth rate which management believe is a reasonable long term growth rate for any of the markets in which the relevant CGUs operate. 
A terminal value is included in the assessment reflecting the Group’s expectation that it will continue to operate in these markets and the 
long term nature of the businesses.

Shareholder Information Financial Statements Corporate Governance Business Review 
• The Group conducts a market risk assessment of CGUs in each country, with a country specific pre-tax discount rate being applied  
to the future pre-tax cash flows for each CGU based on the underlying weighted average cost of capital for the Group. This, was 
unchanged from 2008 at 9%. The underlying pre-tax rate therefore reflects current market assessments of the Group as a whole and  
is adjusted for risks specific to such businesses in each country, giving a risk adjusted range of 12% to 17% (2008: 13% to 20%) for  
the underlying CGUs. The high discount rate in the prior year reflected a significant market risk adjustment, which was in part a reflection 
of the Group’s significantly depressed market capitalisation. A detailed review has been performed of the “value in use” models and the 
appropriate rate at which its cash flows are discounted for impairment test purposes. Whilst the market risk adjustments have been 
added to the underlying CGU discount rates, given the revised cash flows used and consistently stronger market sentiment during 2009, 
as compared to the end of 2008 with respect to Regus’ valuation, these adjustments are significantly below those used in 2008.  
The trading conditions in which the Group operates are subject to competitive and economic pressures that can have a material effect on 
the operating performance of the business. Current market conditions are more challenging for the Group and the current global conditions 
makes forecasting medium term cash flows more difficult than is traditionally the case. The forecast cash flows used to derive the value  
in use are sensitive to changes in revenues (driven by changes in prices, occupancy or a combination of both), costs and discount rates 
(including the market assessment of the risks of the Group reflected in the Group’s market capitalisation). Actual conditions could result in 
either better or worse cash flows than included in the value in use calculation. Should current economic conditions prove to be more severe 
or more prolonged than currently expected this would adversely impact the forecast cash flows and could result in impairments to goodwill 
and indefinite life intangible assets in future periods.  
The amount by which the value in use exceeds the carrying amount of the US CGU is sufficiently large to enable the directors to conclude 
that a reasonably possible change in the key assumptions would not result in an impairment charge for this CGU. The key assumptions 
used in the US model are that in 2010 the forecast centre contribution falls from 21% to 18%, resulting in an operating profit of $10.5m 
(2009: $38.4m). Revenue and costs grow at 3% per annum from 2011 giving a terminal 2014 centre contribution of 23% and operating 
profit of $44.6m. Thereafter a 2% long term growth rate is assumed on revenue and cost into perpetuity. 
Foreseeable events are unlikely to result in a change in the projections of such a significant nature so as to result in most cash generating 
units carrying amount exceeding its recoverable amount. For the UK CGUs, however, a reasonably possible change in the key 
assumptions used to determine the cash generating unit’s recoverable amount could cause the unit’s carrying amount to exceed its  
value in use. 
For the UK, the goodwill and the indefinite life intangible brand in this CGU arose on acquisitions completed in 2006 – principally the 
acquisition of the remaining 58% of the UK business. The value in use exceeded its carrying amount by £20 million (2008: £18 million)  
and therefore no impairment was necessary at 31 December 2009. The main assumptions on which the forecast cash flows were based 
include the impact of the economic downturn in the short term on revenues and margins; the mid-cycle revenue achieved in 2014 prior to 
the application of the long run growth rate and the discount rate used. Revenue is forecast to grow at approximately 5.3% p.a. from 2011. 
A reduction in the growth rate of 0.6% would result in the carrying amount being equal to the value in use. The model assumes no increase 
in gross margin in 2010, a modest increase in 2011 from 10% in 2009 to 12% in 2011 and an increase in operating profits from a loss of 
£2.9 million in 2009 to a breakeven result in 2011. A further fall in gross margins in 2010 and 2011 by 1 point to 9% and 10% respectively 
(equating to an operating loss of £5.3 million) with recovery to a gross margin of 12% in 2012 would result in the recoverable amount  
being equal to the carrying amount. The model assumes a mid-cycle gross margin in 2014 of 17% and an operating profit of £14.2 million.  
A reduction to 16% and £12.8 million would result in the value in use being equal to the carrying amount. The cash flows have been 
discounted using a pre-tax discount rate of 14% (2008:19%). The discount rate used is based on a risk adjusted Group WACC, reflecting 
the specific risk profile of the UK business such as the greater degree of competition in the UK market. An increase in the pre-tax discount 
rate used from 14% to 15% would result in its value in use being equal to its carrying amount. 
There is no goodwill relating to the Group’s joint ventures.

Included with the brand value is £11.2 million relating to the acquisition of the remaining 58% of the UK business in the year ended.  
31 December 2006. The Regus brand acquired in this transaction is assumed to have an indefinite useful life due to the fact that the value 
of the brand is intrinsically linked to the continuing operation of the Group. 
As a result of the Regus brand acquired with the UK business having an indefinite useful life no amortisation is charged but the carrying 
value is assessed for impairment on an annual basis. The brand was tested at the balance sheet date against the recoverable amount of 
the UK business segment at the same time as the goodwill arising on the acquisition of the UK business (see note 12).  For more information visit

Cash, cash equivalents and liquid investment balances held by the Group that are not available for use amounted to £64.3 million at  
31 December 2009 (December 2008: £14.1 million).  
Of this balance, £47.0 million is pledged as security against outstanding bank guarantees and a further £17.3 million is pledged against 
various other commitments of the Group. These amounts are blocked and not available for use by the business. 
Liquid investments represent corporate bonds and cash placed on deposit by the Group with a maturity over three months. Non-cash 
changes comprise the amortisation of debt issue costs, new finance leases entered into and movements in debt maturity. 
23.  Financial instruments and financial risk management 
The objectives, policies and strategies applied by the Group with respect to financial instruments and the management of capital are 
determined at Group level. The Group’s Board maintains responsibility for the risk management strategy of the Group and the Chief 
Financial Officer is responsible for policy on a day to day basis. The Chief Financial Officer and Group Treasurer review the Group’s risk 
management strategy and policies on an ongoing basis. The Board has delegated to the Group Audit Committee the responsibility for 
applying an effective system of internal control and compliance with the Group’s risk management policies. The Audit Committee is 
supported by the Head of Risk Management in performing this role. 
Exposure to credit, interest rate and currency risks arise in the normal course of business. The principal financial instruments used by the 
Group to finance its operations are cash and loans.  Notes to the accounts continued

Going concern 
The Business Review on pages 12 to 15 of the Report and Accounts sets out the Group’s strategy and the factors that are likely to affect 
the future performance and position of the business. The financial review on pages 16 to 18 within the Business review reviews the trading 
performance, financial position and cash flows of the Group. A feature of the Group has been its strong cash flows and during the year 
ended 31 December 2009, despite the difficult trading conditions, the Group has maintained its cash levels at comparable levels to the 
position at the start of the financial year. Although many countries that the Group, operates in continue to experience difficult economic 
conditions, the directors believe that the Group is taking the necessary actions and expect to strengthen the current market leading 
position of the Group.  
After making enquiries, the directors have a reasonable expectation that the Group has adequate resources to continue in operational existence  
for the foreseeable future and accordingly, continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the annual report and accounts. 
Following an internal review of the Group’s facility arrangements in March 2009, and given the strength of the Group’s cash position, the 
Board approved the early surrender of the £100 million revolving credit facility. This decision does not impact the judgement of the directors 
that it is appropriate for the Group to adopt the going concern basis in preparing these accounts. 
Credit risk 
Credit risk could occur where a customer or counterparty defaults under the contractual terms of a financial instrument and arises 
principally in relation to customer contracts and the Group’s cash deposits. 
A diversified customer base and requirement for customer deposits and payments in advance on workstation contracts which contribute 
the majority of the Group’s revenue minimises the Group’s exposure to customer credit risk. No single customer contributes a material 
percentage of the Group’s revenue. The Group’s policy is to provide against trade receivables when specific debts are judged to be 
irrecoverable or where formal recovery procedures have commenced. A provision is created where debts are more than three months 
overdue which reflects the Group’s historical experience of the likelihood of recoverability of these trade receivables. These provisions  
are reviewed on an ongoing basis to assess changes in the likelihood of recoverability. 
Cash assets and derivative financial instruments are only transacted with counterparties of sound credit ratings, and management does  
not expect any counterparty to fail to meet its obligations.  
The maximum exposure to credit risk for trade receivables at the reporting date, analysed by geographic region is summarised below.

Regus plc Annual Report and Accounts 2009_67
Shareholder Information Financial Statements Corporate Governance Business Review 
During the year ended 31 December 2009, the Group provided for an additional £14.1 million against potential bad debts  
(2008: £5.5 million) and utilised £7.1 million directly against the balance of trade receivables (2008: £2.6 million).  
The Group believes no provision is generally required for trade receivables that are not overdue as the Group collects the majority  
of its revenue in advance of the provision of office services and requires deposits from its customers.  
Liquidity risk 
The Group manages liquidity risk by reviewing its global cash position on a weekly basis and expects to have sufficient liquidity to  
meet its financial obligations as they fall due. The Group has free cash and liquid investments (excluding blocked cash) of £180.8 million 
(2008: £205.4 million) which the directors consider adequate to meet the Group’s day to day requirements. 
The Group’s undrawn senior committed facility of £100 million was scheduled to expire on 19 March 2011, subject to the Group continuing 
to comply with the covenants of the facility agreement. The covenants included the ratio of net debt to EBITDA; the ratio of cash flow to net 
debt service (including net interest expense and scheduled debt repayments) and the ratio of EBITDAR to net interest and rental charges.  
In March 2009, the Board approved the early surrender of the £100 million revolving credit facility following an internal review of the Group’s 
facility arrangements. Of the facility approximately £50 million had been set aside to support bank guarantees provided against obligations 
of the Group. In order to continue to support these, the Group deposited sufficient funds with the guaranteeing banks which reduced free 
cash available for use by an equivalent amount. In so doing the directors considered the Group’s forecast and sensitised cash flow 
projections and do not believe that this will have an adverse impact on the Group’s liquidity given the strength of the Group’s cash position. 
Although the Group has net current liabilities, the Group does not consider that this gives rise to a liquidity risk. A large proportion of the 
net current liabilities comprise non-cash liabilities such as deferred income that will be recognised in future periods through the income 
statement. Although the Group holds customer deposits of £149.3 million these are spread across a large number of customers and no 
deposit held for an individual customer is material. Therefore the Group does not believe the balance represents a liquidity risk. 
The net current assets/ (liabilities) of the Group, excluding deferred income were £68.2 million at 31 December 2009 (2008: £0.1 million).  
It is considered appropriate to exclude deferred income in assessing the liquidity of the Group as it reflects the future non-refundable 
contractual revenue of the Group to be recognised as revenue in future periods. 
Market risk 
Interest rate risk 
Surplus cash balances are invested to achieve maximum interest returns on a day to day basis. In order to maximise interest returns, 
surplus cash is also invested in AAA-rated corporate bonds and deposits with a maturity in excess of three months. At the balance  
sheet date no corporate bond or deposit had a maturity in excess of four months. Whenever possible, and subject to the operational 
requirements of the Group, cash is repatriated to the head office and managed by the Group Treasury department.  
Foreign currency risk 
The Group’s exposure to currency risk at a transactional level is minimal as the majority of day to day transactions of overseas subsidiaries 
are carried out in local currency. Working capital balances are generally held in the functional currency of the overseas subsidiary and 
therefore the impact of the retranslation of monetary assets and liabilities in the income statement of overseas subsidiaries is not 
considered to have a material impact on the Group. 
The majority of the Group’s net assets are in Pounds Sterling, US dollars and euros. During the year ended 31 December 2009 the Group 
adopted a policy of partially hedging the translation effect of certain profits incurred in foreign currencies (including the US dollar, euro, 
Japanese yen and certain East European currencies). The policy aimed to reduce the impact on the reported profits of the Group from 
changes in the value of Pounds Sterling against the hedged currencies. As at 31 December 2009, all foreign exchange derivative financial 
instruments had matured and no open positions were held (2008: £nil). 
Historically the Group has occasionally used derivative financial instruments to manage its exposure to foreign currency fluctuations, 
although natural hedges limit the exposure to these risks. In the year ended 31 December 2009, the Group used derivative financial 
instruments to manage the translation risk of certain foreign currencies on the reported profits of the Group. 
No transactions of a speculative nature are undertaken. 
Other market risks 
The Group does not hold any available-for-sale equity securities and is therefore not subject to risks of changes in equity prices.  Notes to the accounts continued

Capital management 
The Group’s parent company is listed on the UK stock exchange and the Board’s policy is to maintain a strong capital base. The Chief 
Financial Officer monitors the diversity of the Group’s major shareholders and further details on the Group’s communication with key 
investors can be found in the corporate governance report on pages 26 to 31. In 2006, the Board approved the commencement of a 
progressive dividend policy to enhance the total return to shareholders. 
The Group’s Chief Executive Officer, Mark Dixon, is the major shareholder of the Company and all executive members of the Board hold 
shares in the Company. Details of the Directors’ shareholdings can be found in the report of the Remuneration Committee on pages 33  
to 39. In addition the Group operates various share option plans for key management and other senior employees. 
At the 2008 Annual General Meeting shareholders approved a resolution for the Group to re-purchase up to 10% of its issued share capital 
in the market. In June 2007, the Group commenced a share buyback programme to meet both  the need to issue shares under the 
Group’s share option programme and, more generally, as a means of returning cash to shareholders. 
In the year ended 31 December 2009 Regus plc purchased 627,258 of its own shares in the open market and utilised these to satisfy 
employee share awards. In 2008 Regus plc re-purchased 3,200,000 of its own shares in the open market and held these shares as 
treasury shares. As at 22 March 2010, 1,076,498 shares were held as treasury shares. 
Neither the company nor any of its subsidiaries are subject to externally imposed capital requirements. 
The Company declared an interim dividend of 0.8p per share (2008: 0.6p) during the year ended 31 December 2009 and proposed a final 
dividend of 1.6p per share (2008: 1.2p per share) a 33% increase on the 2008 dividend.  
There were no other changes to the Group’s approach to capital management during the year. 
The Group’s objective when managing capital (equity and borrowings) is to safeguard the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern 
and to maintain an optimal capital structure to reduce the cost of capital. The Group holds minimal debt and is in a strong cash position 
therefore it is majority equity funded. The Board balances the higher returns possible with higher levels of borrowings with the stability and 
security afforded by a sound capital position. The Group’s return on capital employed for the year ended 31 December 2009, defined as 
operating profit divided by total shareholders’ equity, was 17.2% (2008: 30.7%).

Sensitivity analysis 
At 31 December 2009 it is estimated that a general increase of one percentage point in interest rates would increase the Group’s profit 
before tax by approximately £1.7 million (2008: £1.5 million) with a corresponding increase in total equity. 
It is estimated that a five percentage point weakening in the value of the US dollar against Pounds Sterling would have decreased the 
Group’s profit before tax by approximately £0.9 million for the year ended 31 December 2009 (2008: £3.4 million). It is estimated that a five 
percentage point weakening in the value of the euro against Pounds Sterling would have decreased the Group’s profit before tax by 
approximately £1.1 million for the year ended 31 December 2009 (2008: £1.1 million). 
It is estimated that a five percentage point weakening in the value of the US dollar against Pounds Sterling would have decreased the 
Group’s total equity by approximately £9.1 million for the year ended 31 December 2009 (2008: £12.2 million). It is estimated that a five 
percentage point weakening in the value of the euro against Pounds Sterling would have increased the Group’s total equity by 
approximately £0.7 million for the year ended 31 December 2009 (2008: £0.3 million).

Summary of methods and assumptions: 
Trade and other receivables/payables and customer deposits 
For receivables/payables with a remaining life of less than one year, the notional amount is deemed to reflect the fair value. 
Finance lease liabilities 
The fair value of finance leases has been calculated by discounting future cash flows at an appropriate discount rate which reflects current 
market assessments and the risks specific to such liabilities. 
Loans and overdrafts 
The fair value of bank loans, overdrafts and other loans approximates to the carrying value because interest rates are at floating rates where 
payments are reset to market rates at intervals of less than one year.  Notes to the accounts continued

The Group held several foreign currency swaps in the year, all of which matured during the year. The aggregate gain in the movement of 
the fair value of these instruments was £2.2m. The instruments were not designated as hedges and the gain has been recognised in the 
income statement. No derivative financial instruments were held at the year end (2008: £nil).

Performance conditions for share options 
The options awarded in 2004 included certain performance criteria that needed to be met in order for the share options to vest. The share 
options vested based on the basic earnings per share (adjusted for non-recurring items and goodwill and intangible amortisation) that 
exceeded the targets linked to the Retail Price Index. The basic earnings per share for performance purposes was 1p. 100% of the options 
awarded in July and September 2004 vested during 2007. 
The options awarded in March 2007, April 2007 and March 2008 have the same performance conditions as the CIP Matching Awards 
granted in the same year as described further below. 
The awards of options made in March 2007 and April 2007 (normal vesting date March 2010 and April 2010) failed to meet the related 
performance conditions (based on the financial performance of the Group in the year ended 31 December 2009) and therefore lapsed. 
The share options awarded in 2004 were valued using the Black-Scholes model. The share options awarded in 2007 and 2008 are valued 
using a Monte Carlo method. The inputs to the model are as follows:

* Adjusted EPS 
It is recognised by the Remuneration Committee that the additional EPS targets represent a highly challenging goal and consequently in 
determining whether they have been met the Committee will exercise its discretion. The overall aim is that the relevant EPS targets must 
have been met on a run rate or underlying basis. As such an adjusted measure of EPS will be calculated designed to assess the underlying 
performance of the business. 
While the Remuneration Committee reserves the right to adjust EPS as it sees fit at the time, by way of example, the following adjustments 
are currently anticipated: 
• In a growth company such as Regus, costs are necessarily incurred in one year to drive profits in future years. As such it is important to 
ensure management is not incentivised to cut back on these investments to meet EPS targets in any one year. Accordingly those costs, 
incurred in the vesting year, which it considers necessary to drive future growth will be excluded from the EPS calculation. These would 
include, inter alia, the costs of the business development departments, excess marketing expenditures and current year losses from 
investing in new locations. 
• Any one-off or non-recurring costs will be excluded. 
• It is expected that in the period between 2006 and 2008 the cash tax rate will rise as cumulative tax losses are utilised thereby increasing 
progressively the challenge of achieving a 14p EPS target. This will then be further complicated by the need to recognise deferred tax 
assets as the business strengthens reducing the accounting rate of tax in one year and increasing it in the next. To provide greater clarity 
and incentive to management EPS will be calculated based upon the cash tax rate up to a maximum of 30%. 
• The Remuneration Committee is of the opinion that the EPS and free cash flow performance targets are a transparent and accurate 
measure of the Company’s performance at this time and are the key corporate metrics for driving long term shareholder value. In 
addition, the Total Shareholder Return (“TSR”) condition will ensure that executives are encouraged to focus on ensuring that the 
Company’s return to shareholders is competitive compared to comparable companies.

The performance conditions for awards under the matching share element of the CIP made in March 2007 are set out below: 
% increase in published EPS for the year ended 31 December 2009 compared to the published EPS for the prior year 
15% 20% 25% 30%

20% 19% 38% 56% 75%
25% 25% 50% 75% 100%
% denotes the % of the Award which will be released at the end of the performance period.  
In addition, no awards will be released unless the Company’s TSR is at least at the median when compared against that of the companies 
comprising the FTSE 350 Support Services Sector at the date of the grant subject to the discretion of the Remuneration Committee. 
The awards of Matching Shares made in March 2007 (normal vesting date March 2010) failed to meet the related performance conditions 
(based on the financial performance of the Group in the year ended 31 December 2009) and therefore lapsed. The associated Investment 
Share awards will be released to participants (subject to any tax liabilities in accordance with the rules of the CIP). 
As indicated in the Remuneration Report in the Annual Report for the year ended 31 December 2008, the Remuneration Committee felt it 
inappropriate to set specific performance conditions for Matching Shares under the CIP and options awards under the Share Option Plan 
awarded in March 2008 and March 2009 but were committed to carrying out a thorough review of the matter during 2009. The 
Remuneration Committee has agreed that the following modifications will be made to the awards made in 2008 and 2009 and that the 
following performance conditions will apply to these awards effective from 22 March 2010. 
The total number of awards made in 2008 and 2009 to each participant will be divided into three separate equal amounts and will be 
subject to future performance periods of three, four and five years respectively. Thus, conditional on meeting the performance targets, the 
first amount will not vest until March 2013, the second will not vest until March 2014 and the third will not vest until March 2015. These 
vesting dates relate to the financial years ending 31 December 2012, 31 December 2013 and 31 December 2014 respectively. The vesting 
of these awards will be subject to the achievement of challenging corporate performance targets. 75% of each of the three amounts will be 
subject to defined earnings per share (EPS) targets over the respective performance periods. The remaining 25% of each will be subject to 
relative total shareholder return (TSR) targets over the respective periods. The targets will be as follows: 
EPS targets for the financial years ending
% of awards eligible for vesting 2012 2013 2014
25% 15p 17p 18p
50% 16p 20p 22p
75% 17p 23p 26p
100% 18p 26p 30p
No shares will vest in each respective year unless the minimum EPS target for that year is achieved.

Increments of 0.75% For each complete 1% above 100%
100% 200% or above
* over three, four or five year performance period. 
The Remuneration Committee has determined that no awards of Investment Shares or Matching Shares will be made in March 2010. 
However, the Committee can make stand-alone long term incentive awards under the CIP without reference to annual bonus up to a 
maximum of 100% of salary per calendar year. The Committee has determined that it is appropriate to make LTIP awards during 2010  
of up to 100% of salary. The performance conditions will be the same as those set out above over a three year performance period (but 
with a single vesting date in March 2013). The determination of the share awards will be made subsequent to the publication of this report. 
However the maximum number of awards will be based on the price of an ordinary share at the time of grant and the monetary value  
will not exceed 100% of basic salary. Full details will be disclosed in the Remuneration Committee Report for the year ending  
31 December 2011.  For more information visit

25.  Acquisitions 
During the year ended 31 December 2009 the Group made no significant acquisitions.  
Adjustments to acquisitions and the payment of contingent consideration in relation to acquisitions completed prior to  
1 January 2009. 
Additional consideration of £0.3 million was accrued in December 2009 due to improved financial performance of acquisitions under 
contractual earn-out provisions. In addition, amendments to provisional purchase price allocations on acquisitions completed in previous 
years resulted in an increase in goodwill of £0.5 million. 
Details of all acquisitions completed in the year ended 31 December 2008 
Details of all acquisitions made during 2008 are set out below. All of the acquired operations are providers of outsourced workplace 
solutions. Where no equity was acquired the Group acquired all the operating assets and liabilities of the related business excluding cash. 
All acquisitions made in the year have been aggregated as no single acquisition is material. These transactions have been accounted for 
using the purchase method of accounting.  For more information visit

Financial Statements 
31.  Key judgmental areas adopted in preparing these accounts 
The preparation of financial statements in accordance with IFRS requires management to make certain judgements and assumptions that 
affect reported amounts and related disclosures.
Fair value accounting for business combinations 
For each business combination, we assess the fair values of assets 
and liabilities acquired. Where there is not an active market in the 
category of the non-current assets typically acquired with a 
business centre or where the books and records of the acquired 
company do not provide sufficient information to derive an accurate 
valuation, management calculate an estimated fair value based on 
available information and experience.  
The main categories of acquired non-current assets where 
management’s judgement has an impact on the amounts recorded 
include tangible fixed assets, customer list intangibles and the fair 
market value of leasehold assets and liabilities. For significant 
business combinations management also obtain third party 
valuations to provide additional guidance over the appropriate 
valuation to be included in the financial statements.  
Valuation of intangibles and goodwill 
We evaluate the fair value of goodwill and intangibles to assess 
potential impairments on an annual basis, or during the year if an 
event or other circumstance indicates that we may not be able to 
recover the carrying amount of the asset. We evaluate the carrying 
value of goodwill at the appropriate cash generating unit level and 
make that determination based upon future cash flow projections, 
which assume certain growth projections which may or may not 
occur. We record an impairment loss for goodwill when the carrying 
value of the intangible asset is less than its estimated recoverable 
amount. Further details of the methodology and assumptions 
applied to the impairment review in the year ended 31 December 
2008, including the sensitivity to changes in those assumptions,  
can be found in note 12. 
Tax assets and liabilities 
We base our estimate of deferred tax assets and liabilities on 
current tax laws and rates and, in certain cases, business plans  
and other expectations about future outcomes. Changes in existing 
laws and rates, and their related interpretations, and future business 
results may affect the amount of deferred tax liabilities or the 
valuation of deferred tax assets over time. Our accounting for 
deferred tax consequences represents management’s best 
estimate of future events that can be appropriately reflected in  
the accounting estimates. It is current Group policy to recognise  
a deferred tax asset when it is probable that future taxable profits 
will be available against which the assets can be used. The Group 
considers it probable if the entity has made a taxable profit in the 
previous year and is forecast to continue to make a profit in the 
foreseeable future. Where appropriate the Group assesses the 
potential risk of future tax liabilities arising from the operation of its 
business in multiple tax jurisdictions and includes provisions within 
tax liabilities for those risks that can be estimated reliably. Changes 
in existing tax laws can affect large international groups similar to 
Regus and could result in significant additional tax liabilities over  
and above those already provided for. 
Onerous lease provisions 
We have identified certain poor performing centres where the lease 
is considered onerous, i.e. the Group does not expect to recover 
the unavoidable lease costs up to the first break point. The 
accounts include a provision for our estimate of the net amounts 
payable under the terms of the lease to the first break point, 
discounted at the Group weighted average cost of capital, where 
appropriate. 
Dilapidations 
Certain of our leases with landlords include a clause obliging the 
Group to hand the property back in the condition as at the date  
of signing the lease. The costs to bring the property back to that 
condition are not known until the Group exit the property so the 
Group estimates the costs at each balance sheet date. However, 
given that landlords often regard the nature of changes made to 
properties as improvements, the Group estimates that it is unlikely 
that any material dilapidation payments will be necessary. 
Consequently provision has been made only for those potential 
dilapidation payments when it is probable that an outflow will occur 
and can be reliably estimated.  For more information visit

20
years on…
2009 was the 20th anniversary of the opening of our ﬁrst centre in Brussels. In one way it seems like
only yesterday but it truly was another age. Europe was still divided by an Iron Curtain, a mobile phone
was something you carried on your back or in a car and if you’d said ‘internet’ to anyone they would
probably have thought you were talking about ﬁshing.
Throughout the dramatic upheavals of the 1990’s and technological innovations of the dot.com boom
we have stayed true to our core value of helping organisations, and the people that make them, work
whenever, wherever and however they want. Working smarter is as true today as it was when we
opened that ﬁrst centre.
We know this because, irrespective of the internal and external challenges we have faced, we have a
successful business which provides a much in demand service whose time, I ﬁrmly believe, has ﬁnally
come. We are in the throes of a working revolution that is changing the way organisations function, the
way people live, and the way we relate to our environment. Increasingly, people aren’t going to work;
work is coming to them.
It is now exactly a decade since Daniel Pink, former speech writer to Al Gore, wrote his book Free
Agent Nation, in which he contrasted the emerging lifestyle of the ﬂexible worker with that of the
traditional ‘organisation man’ of the late 20th century. Pink was one of the ﬁrst to consider the ways
that such lone wolves would have to be supported in order to link up with business and society –
meeting-places and networks both physical and virtual.
But whereas Pink was concentrating on self-employed people, today’s ﬂexible worker is just as likely 
to be employed, albeit in a way that is very different from the traditional employer/employee
relationship. The difference today is that the power belongs not with the organisation or employer, but
with the ﬂexible workers themselves. As these and other factors, such as the scarceness of capital
and mainstreaming of environmental concerns begin to converge I become ever more conﬁdent and
excited about our future than I have ever been in any of the last 20 years.
Where will we be in 2029? Who can honestly know with any accuracy? Personally I’ve always found
that the easiest way to predict the future is to invent it. What I can be sure of is that over the next 20
years there will be more dramatic upheavals to come and events will continue to blindside us all, but
however much the world changes and technologies develop people, and the organisations for which
they work, will always need the places to congregate and collaborate, to share thoughts and ideas, to
work wherever, whenever and however. And I know that Regus will be at the very forefront of providing
these services.

For most of 2009, the European buyout market suffered  
from the fragility in the broader economic environment. 
There was an unprecedented decline in investments, 
realisations and fund raising activities caused by an 
economic slowdown across the world, the near collapse 
of the global banking system and the tightening of credit 
markets. These events resulted in deal values declining  
to levels not seen since 1996, with deal volumes falling  
to 1993 levels.

Chairman’s statement
The last year was one of enormous challenge  
for all participants in the private equity industry –  
and Candover was clearly not immune.
There was an unprecedented decline in investments, realisations 
and fund raising activities caused by an economic slowdown 
across the world, the near collapse of the global banking system 
and the tightening of credit markets. These events, combined with 
lower valuations and weaker trading in portfolio companies, forced 
many private equity houses to reappraise their strategies. Candover 
faced all these challenges which, in our case, were amplified by the 
structural aspects unique to our long-standing business model. 
Over the course of the last year we took decisive action. Candover 
has moved to a situation in which its overall stability is much 
improved from a position of financial and corporate uncertainty. 
The strategic review conducted in the first half of the year, the 
subsequent essential restructuring of the business and the 
Candover 2008 Fund, together with the timely benefit of asset 
realisations and an improvement in the external environment,  
have all contributed to our much improved financial health.
Our results for 2009 very much reflect the overall improvement  
in our underlying financial position. Net asset value per share  
rose only marginally from 1026p to 1038p for the full year to  
31st December but this masks the adverse effects of currency 
movements and one off exceptional costs associated with 
restructuring our business, offset by the recovery in the value  
of our investments over the second half of the year. At 30th June  
we reported a 12.1% decline in net asset value per share; over  
the course of the second half of the year we have seen this rise  
by 15.1%. 
At the beginning of the year, the Board was entirely non-executive 
and Candover Investments plc had no separate executive 
management. This was not satisfactory given the turmoil we faced. 
Malcolm Fallen joined the Company on an interim basis in March 
2009 and was appointed CEO in September. His appointment was 
not only instrumental in helping to achieve stability but also it  
has redefined our operational model thereby helping to manage  
the potential conflicts in our structure. We are confident that 
Malcolm’s leadership will continue to be an important factor in 
driving the business forward and in the creation of future value  
for shareholders.
The restructuring of Candover Partners provided the opportunity 
to implement its long-planned succession strategy. John Arney 
was appointed Managing Partner, a new position, responsible 
for strategy and management, while Marek Gumienny became 
Chairman of Candover Partners. Following the resolution of the 
Candover 2008 Fund discussions, Colin Buffin left the Company 
after 25 years and we would like to thank him and other departed 
colleagues for their immense contribution to the development of  
the business.
There will be further changes to the Board in 2010 to reflect  
the fact that Candover is now a smaller company managed  
by a full time CEO. The Board will reduce in size from seven  
non-executive positions to four, with Antony Hichens, Chris  
Russell and Nicholas Jones stepping down at the Annual  
General Meeting. All three are to be thanked for their service  
over the years, with Antony notably having served as a  
non-executive for 21 years, latterly as the Senior Independent 
Director. Richard Stone will become Chairman of the Audit,  
Risk and Valuation Committee, Lord Jay will become the  
Senior Independent Director, Jan Oosterveld will become  
Chairman of the Remuneration Committee and I will become 
Chairman of the Nominations Committee. 
In light of the financial results for the year, the Board has decided 
that it is not yet appropriate to recommend that the Company pays 
a dividend. However, the Board expects to recommend restarting 
the payment of dividends when the Company is in an appropriate 
position to do so.
The completion of the strategic review, the subsequent 
restructuring process and the agreement reached with the Limited 
Partners of the Candover 2008 Fund draws to a close a difficult 
period for Candover. As we begin 2010, we are well positioned  
to move forward on a more stable basis – while remaining mindful  
of continued uncertainty in the external environment. The outlook 
for the macro economic environment remains hard to predict, 
although the worst of the banking crisis appears to be behind us 
and the major economies are starting to emerge from recession. 
This should be good for the longer term value of our investments.  
The flow of private equity transactions has begun to increase,  
albeit modestly, and this should enhance our ability to benefit  
from realisations which in turn should improve our financial  
position further.

CEO’s report
Our priority over the last year has been to 
implement a plan that would deliver improved 
stability for the Company and we have made  
good progress.
Performance
The Company’s net assets per share increased by 1.2% over the 
year to 1038p (2008: 1026p) after non-recurring exceptional costs 
of £17.1 million and adverse currency movements of £20.2 million. 
At the half year we reported a 12.1% decrease in net assets per 
share, but in the second half of the year there was a steady recovery 
in the underlying value of the portfolio, resulting in net assets per 
share up 15.1% at the year end. This was mainly due to an increase 
in the multiples derived from the quoted markets which we use 
when valuing our assets. 
Asset sales made a major contribution to our stabilisation, with the 
sale of Wood Mackenzie by Candover Partners in July substantially 
improving our financial position. The Company received cash 
proceeds of £36.4 million, which included £16.8 million from the 
crystallisation of carried interest payments from the Candover 2001 
Fund. During the year, we also sold our interest in three French 
buyout funds for £5.3 million. The positive impact of these events 
helped us manage our net debt position and greatly enhanced our 
ability to meet the covenant obligations on our loan notes.
In December 2009, Candover acquired the remaining tranche of 
Expro International shares. As outlined last year this tranche of 
shares had been held in a separate entity, which was guaranteed by 
the Company, following the purchase of Expro International in July 
2008. This structure was created to enable the Limited Partners 
in the Candover 2008 Fund (which had not had a first closing at 
the time of the Expro International transaction) to participate in 
the investment by way of syndication. After the first and second 
closings, m43.2 million (£40.0 million) remained in the entity pending 
syndication, which, following the suspension of the Candover 2008 
Fund, did not take place. As a result, this stake was taken on to our 
statement of financial position at the year end.
The combination of realisations, the restructuring costs and the 
impact of acquiring the additional Expro International investment 
has resulted in our net debt at the year end rising to £74.8 million 
against £54.5 million at the start of 2009. At 31st December 2009, 
our loan-to-value ratio was 26% (2008: 34%) and was 25% at 
30th June 2009 – both well within the required threshold of 40% as 
required under the terms of our loan note. The improvement in our 
loan-to-value ratio reflects the uplift in the value of our investments. 
Our cash of £106.3 million and an undrawn £100.0 million bank 
facility mean that we have access to sufficient capital to meet our 
follow-on commitments of £80.8 million to the Candover 2005 Fund.
Since the year end, the Company has received a further 
£14.7 million by way of proceeds from the sale of Springer 
Science+Business Media by Candover Partners, together with  
a further carried interest payment from the Candover 2001 Fund.  
The effect of these cash proceeds has been to reduce net debt  
on a pro-forma basis to £60.1 million and the loan-to-value ratio  
to 23%.
The current portfolio does have both sector and geographical 
diversity, but one of the consequences of the realisations and  
the acquisition of the additional stake in Expro International  
is the increase in its concentration during the last year. As at  
31st December 2009, the ten largest investments comprised  
87.7% of Candover’s investment value (2008: 85.4% on a  
like-for-like basis), with Expro International individually  
accounting for 29.9% (2008: 21.2%). This concentration  
will continue as further realisations occur.
Strategic review and the Candover 2008 Fund 
The first half of the year was particularly testing and we undertook 
a comprehensive review of strategic options as we sought to 
reinforce our financial position and maximise value for shareholders. 
The outcome was a radical restructuring in the scope and scale 
of our operations. We considered a range of other options for 
the business, including expressions of interest in acquiring the 
Company. However, after careful consideration, we concluded 
that none of these would deliver superior value for shareholders 
compared with the anticipated benefits from the future realisation  
of the portfolio.
Our work on strategy went hand-in-hand with the process of 
reaching agreement with Candover Partners and the Limited 
Partners of the Candover 2008 Fund over the future of that fund. 
The investment period of the Candover 2008 Fund was put into 
suspension in March 2009 in order to allow talks on its future to be 
concluded following our assessment that we would not be able to 
maintain our m1.0 billion commitment. These talks concluded that 
it would not be appropriate to resurrect the Candover 2008 Fund 
and shortly after the year end we announced that agreement had 
been reached to terminate the investment period of the fund.
The Candover 2008 Fund’s sole investment is in Expro  
International. Under the termination agreement, investor 
commitments have been scaled back pro rata to meet the cost of 
the Expro International investment. Additionally, a follow-on reserve 
of m100 million has been created to allow Expro International to 
continue to take advantage of market opportunities. The Company 
will not be contributing to this follow-on reserve. The other key 
terms of the agreement are that the Company will surrender its 
Candover 2008 Fund carry entitlement to the Limited Partners  
and that all Limited Partners have waived any claims that they  
may have against the Company and Candover Partners as a  
result of our withdrawal from the Candover 2008 Fund.  Section 1:

Candover 
Report and accounts 2009 05
Overall, we believe that the Candover 2008 Fund was terminated 
on terms satisfactory to Candover Investments plc.
The impact of the formal termination of the Candover 2008 Fund, 
taken together with other key events since March 2009, leaves 
us with the financial strength to meet our remaining investment 
commitments to the Candover 2005 Fund. This can be seen by 
looking at the Company’s uncalled commitments position from a 
“before and after” perspective as illustrated in the table below.  
The ratio of outstanding commitments to net assets has fallen from 
393% to 36%, whilst the ratio of cash and undrawn bank facilities  
to outstanding commitments has risen from 23% to 255%.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Candover Partners
During 2009, we considered carefully the validity of the structure of 
our business model; specifically, whether a listed public company 
which invests, realises and recycles profits through a wholly-owned 
discretionary fund manager, which owes fiduciary duties to its 
third party Limited Partner investors, had sufficient control over 
its own destiny. As part of this, we reviewed the various internal 
arrangements that operated within the Company and considered 
the legal separation of Candover Partners from the Company. We 
concluded that the informal arrangements that existed between 
Candover Partners and the Company were not sufficiently 
robust. Since the year end, we have therefore entered into a 
binding agreement with Candover Partners which formalises the 
relationship between the Company as an investor and Candover 
Partners as its asset manager. This agreement sets clear rules 
for our financial arrangements with Candover Partners which are 
market based and also defines the administrative services required 
by the Company.
We do not believe that legal separation is a current priority as 
the interests of the Company and Candover Partners are closely 
aligned at this point in time, with the principal aim being maximising 
the value of the existing portfolio in the interests of all investors. 
Together with Candover Partners, we analysed the level of 
operating resources appropriate to our changed environment and 
this resulted in a reduction in staffing from 100 at the start of 2009 
to 42 today. We also closed our nascent operations in Asia and 
Eastern Europe. 
We are committed to supporting the restructured Candover 
Partners team to enable them to deliver the value in the portfolio.
Risk-based management
The events of last year have strengthened our view that we need to 
embed risk management more firmly throughout Candover. This will 
not only provide strong corporate governance, but will also actively 
protect and manage shareholder value. We have undertaken a 
comprehensive risk review exercise, focused on updating the risk 
profiles of both the Company and Candover Partners. We now 
have a group-wide picture of risk which distinguishes between the 
roles of the investor and asset manager respectively and which is 
presented in the Risk review section starting on page 36. 
Private equity as an asset class has an inherently higher risk  
level than some other asset classes with the corresponding 
potential for higher rewards. We will continue to monitor this very 
closely to ensure the right balance. However, if we were materially 
to increase the level of risk mitigation, such as through the use of 
derivatives, we believe this could significantly affect the potential 
returns available.
Strategy and priorities
In the next phase of its development, Candover will focus on 
the following key measures which we believe are both clear 
determinants of shareholder value and consistent with a  
risk-based approach:
– the level of our net assets per share; 
– the ratio of our net debt to the value of our investments;
–  the ratio of our outstanding investment commitments relative  
to net assets;
–  the level of our cash balances and undrawn bank facilities 
relative to these outstanding commitments; and
– the level of concentration within the investment portfolio.
We believe that use of these metrics will provide us with clarity  
on performance and will highlight which options are realistic  
as we develop a sustainable model for growing shareholder  
value in private equity over the longer term. 
Our priority for the year ahead is to build on the progress we have 
made, exploring the options we now have for the Company that 
will ensure an enduring business which creates value for all of 
Candover’s investors.

Financial review
Net asset value per share
Net assets per share after currency movements and exceptional 
non-recurring costs were 1038p, an increase of 1.2% since  
31st December 2008. 
Two-thirds of our investments are Euro denominated and therefore 
the valuation of these assets is exposed to the Euro/Sterling 
exchange rate. Candover manages its currency exposure in  
order to mitigate any adverse impact on its loan-to-value covenant 
through the denomination of its cash, debt and swaps rather  
than managing potential currency impacts on net asset values.  
As a result, currency fluctuations can have a material impact on  
net assets. See Table 1.
At 31st December 2009, net assets per share before currency 
movements and exceptional non-recurring costs were 1208p 
compared to 1026p at 31st December 2008. The increase of 
17.7% over the year compares with a rise in the FTSE All-Share  
of 25.0% over the same period, reflecting the growing stabilisation 
in the underlying investment value of the portfolio. 
Investments
The valuation of investments, including carried interest and accrued 
loan note interest, at 31st December 2009 was £319.9 million  
(31st December 2008: £313.9 million).
Valuation movements before currency effects were £59.0 million. 
Taking into account additions and disposals, this is an increase of 
20.5% on the value of investments at 31st December 2008.  
See Table 2.
Net debt 
Candover’s net debt has increased from £54.5 million at 31st 
December 2008 to £74.8 million at 31st December 2009. The 
increase in net debt reflects the impact of the acquisition of the 
Expro International shares, which had been guaranteed by the 
Company, for m43.2 million. Realisation proceeds received during 
the year were £45.1 million, partly offset by operating cash outflows 
relating to the non-recurring exceptional costs. See Table 3.
The outstanding commitment to the Candover 2005 Fund fell 
to £80.8 million at 31st December 2009 from £90.4 million at 
31st December 2008, largely due to currency movements.  
This commitment compares to cash balances of £106.3 million  
plus an undrawn revolving credit facility of £100.0 million which 
expires in October 2012.

Report and accounts 2009 07
Whilst net debt has increased, the loan-to-value ratio has reduced 
from 33.6% at the start of the year to 26.4% at the end of the year 
due to the realisations achieved, uplifts in valuations and careful 
control of costs. The guarantee provided against the remaining 
Expro International shares that had not been syndicated has 
now been released following the acquisition of these shares by 
Candover. Prior to the acquisition, the Company was required to 
treat the guarantee as debt for the purposes of the loan-to-value 
calculations, but could not include the value of the related Expro 
International shares. Following the acquisition, the value of the 
shares is taken into account and this has a small favourable effect 
on the loan-to-value ratio.
Taking into account the proceeds received from the sale of  
Springer Science+Business Media post year end together with 
further carry from the Candover 2001 Fund, the loan-to-value  
ratio has fallen to 22.7% on a pro-forma basis.
Profit before tax
Profit before exceptional items and tax at 31st December 2009  
was £10.4 million compared to £5.2 million in the prior year.  
This increase in profit resulted from the impact of restructuring  
our cost base to offset lower management fee income, together 
with improvements in the underlying portfolio and increasing  
levels of accrued investment income.
Exceptional non-recurring costs of £17.1 million were incurred  
on undertaking the strategic review, restructuring and discontinuing 
operations in Asia and Eastern Europe.

Manager’s portfolio review
For the first time in its 29 year history, following the suspension 
of the Candover 2008 Fund in March, Candover Partners 
made no new investments during the year. As a result of this, 
and mindful of the challenging economic climate faced by our 
portfolio company management teams, our priority has been to 
ensure that the portfolio has been well positioned to minimise the 
negative impacts of a downturn, as well as being well equipped 
to build value for the future. Our approach for each company has 
therefore focused on ensuring that: 
–  an appropriate and sustainable capital structure is in place;
–  management are focused on the challenges faced by their 
businesses; and
–  the businesses are well positioned to maximise profitability and 
cash flow, either organically or by acquisition.
During the year, four companies completed financial restructurings. In 
the case of both ALcontrol and Ferretti, we concluded that committing 
further capital as part of these restructurings would not be in investors’ 
interests and the investments were exited at no value. By contrast, in 
the case of Hilding Anders we played an active role in the restructuring 
and as a consequence Candover and its Limited Partners remain the 
majority shareholder after providing additional funding of m29 million for 
future acquisitions in the form of an equity bridge. Expro International 
successfully refinanced its entire senior debt by raising a US$1.4 billion 
high yield bond, thereby ensuring that its financial structure is better 
suited to the cyclical nature of the oil and gas sector. Its net debt to 
EBITDA stands at around 6x and funding headroom has been reset to 
provide greater flexibility through the cycle. 
Overall, six of our ten largest investments show earnings ahead of 
prior year and we believe that they are all well positioned to grow 
in 2010. In terms of the level of leverage across the portfolio, the 
weighted average net debt to EBITDA multiple for those of the 
largest ten investments included within the Candover 2001 Fund 
has fallen to 3.4x (2008: 4.2x). Excluding Expro International, where 
its capital structure has been altered by the high yield bond, the 
weighted average net debt to EBITDA multiple for those of the 
largest ten investments included in the Candover 2005 Fund has 
remained steady at 5.2x despite the adverse market conditions of 
the past year.
Investments and realisations
Whilst there were no new investments made by the managed funds, 
Candover acquired the remaining m43.2 million (£40.0 million) of 
Expro International shares.
Candover and the managed funds achieved realisation proceeds 
of £223.6 million during the year – Candover’s own share of such 
realisation proceeds was £45.1 million. In June, Candover and the 
Candover 2001 Fund sold their holding in Wood Mackenzie. The sale 
generated proceeds of £36.4 million for Candover (including loan 
note interest of £0.7 million), of which £16.8 million resulted from the 
crystallisation of carried interest. The Candover 2001 Fund achieved  
a return of £173.6 million before payments of carried interest 
(including loan note interest of £5.0 million), bringing the overall 
investment multiple to 2.7x with an IRR of 56%. In addition, Candover 
sold its interests in three French buyout funds (Ciclad 2, 3 and 4) for  
£5.3 million. 
The sale of Springer Science+Business Media, completed in 
February 2010, generated proceeds of £14.7 million for Candover 
which included further carried interest distributions relating to the 
For most of the year, the European buyout market 
suffered from the fragility in the broader economic 
environment. The combination of uncertainty  
around valuations, the lack of availability of debt 
and general market malaise resulted in deal values 
declining to levels not seen since 1996, with deal 
volumes falling to 1993 levels.

Ten largest investments 
The ten largest investments were written up by  
£23.1 million (107p per share) during the year to  
31st December 2009.
1
 Expro International
Expro International is one of the leading oil field service providers 
specialising in well flow management with a particular focus on 
the most technically challenging deepwater environments. Expro 
International’s operations are critical to the development of oil and 
gas reservoirs and are utilised by multinational oil majors as well 
as state-owned national oil companies. Expro International has 
faced a challenging environment over the past 12 months, but 
we are confident that the sector fundamentals of a tight supply of 
hydrocarbons, coupled with high rates of reserve decline, will begin 
to reassert themselves. In December 2009, Expro International 
successfully raised a US$1.4 billion high yield bond in order to 
optimise the company’s capital structure. The proceeds were used 
to refinance in full the original senior debt facilities; the mezzanine 
debt was retained and covenant headroom expanded. This 
investment has been written up by £24.4 million (112p per share), 
despite adverse foreign exchange movements, to reflect improved 
public market comparables. 
2
 Stork
Stork is a diversified Dutch engineering conglomerate active in 
the aerospace and technical services sectors. The group enjoys 
good market positions in the sectors and niches in which it 
operates and there is a clear strategy for driving value from each 
of the divisions. Stork faced a number of challenges in 2009 with 
each of the markets it serves suffering from the global recession. 
Management implemented a number of cost cutting measures, 
the benefits of which are now being seen. The investment in 
Stork has been held at the prior valuation, although an adverse 
exchange rate movement resulted in a downward adjustment of 
£3.2 million (15p per share).

 Parques Reunidos
Parques Reunidos further consolidated its position during the 
year as one of the world’s leading operators of attraction parks. 
The company enjoys strong positions in all its key markets and 
the majority of the parks are the leading family attraction in the 
surrounding area. Parques performed well in 2009, with profits 
ahead of prior year despite the economic downturn and poor 
weather in the US during the summer months. Management 
continue to drive operational improvements throughout the park 
portfolio, particularly in the parks acquired in the past 12-18 
months. The investment was written up by £0.8 million (4p per 
share), despite adverse foreign exchange movements, to reflect 
the profit growth during the year.

 Alma Consulting Group
Alma Consulting Group is one of the European leaders in cost 
reduction and optimisation, offering a wide range of services 
based on a success fee model. The business continues to 
develop organically, with profits ahead of prior year driven by 
solid sales growth and good cost control. The valuation has been 
written up by £4.1 million (19p per share) despite adverse foreign 
exchange movements.

 Ontex
Ontex, one of the leading European manufacturers of retailer 
branded diapers and feminine hygiene products, reported strong 
profit growth in 2009 driven by lower raw material pricing and 
manufacturing efficiencies. Ontex continues to focus on customer 
satisfaction and has won a number of new contracts during the

 Equity Trust
Equity Trust, a leading trust and fiduciary services group, 
performed well during the year due to its market position, global

 Qioptiq
Qioptiq is one of the world’s leading manufacturers of high-
precision optical components. The business continued to benefit 
from strong defence markets both in the UK and the US. However, 
growth was offset by a weak commercial market, which has 
particularly suffered from the global recession, and the negative 
effect of currency movements. The valuation has been written 
down by £4.0 million (18p per share), after adverse foreign 
exchange movements.

 EurotaxGlass’s
EurotaxGlass’s, a provider of automotive intelligence, is 
predominantly a B2B subscription business providing valuation 
data to all sectors of the automotive industry. Whilst its revenues 
are not correlated to new car sales, the global downturn has had 
an impact on some areas of the business such as advertising 
revenues from dealers. Management have successfully completed 
the restructuring of the cost base commenced in 2008, which 
has limited the impact of weaker sales. The investment has 
been written down by £4.8 million (22p per share) to reflect the 
difficult trading environment as well as adverse foreign exchange 
movements.

 Capital Safety Group
Capital Safety Group is one of the global market leaders in height 
safety and fall protection equipment. Capital Safety’s products 
are widely used in industries such as oil and gas, construction 
(predominantly non-residential), manufacturing and telecoms. 
These sectors have all, to varying degrees, been impacted by  
the global economic downturn, although management are, as  
far as possible, mitigating the impact of the recession on revenues 
through operational improvements and by taking steps to position 
the business in new markets. Given the challenging trading 
environment, the investment has been written down by £4.4 million 
(20p per share) after adverse foreign exchange movements.

 Innovia Films
Innovia Films manufactures speciality films primarily for  
packaging and is the only manufacturer of polymer bank notes in 
the world via a joint venture with the Reserve Bank of Australia. 
The valuation was written up by £5.0 million (23p per share) 
reflecting the strong profit growth achieved in 2009 on the back  
of lower raw material costs.

Manager’s portfolio review
continued
The remainder of the portfolio was written up by  
£8.7 million (39p per share).
1. Springer Science+Business Media 
Springer Science+Business Media is a publisher of scientific 
journals and books. The company has been at the forefront of the 
industry’s move towards electronic content, with the migration 
from print to online books in particular driving the company’s 
performance. An agreement was reached to sell Springer 
Science+Business Media in December 2009 and the transaction 
completed in February 2010. The valuation has been written down 
by £16.7 million (77p per share) to reflect the sale price. Together 
with the proceeds received from three earlier refinancings, Springer 
Science+Business Media returned a cash equivalent of 1.8x the 
original investment and an IRR of 28%. 
2. ICG Mezzanine Fund 2003
1
ICG Mezzanine Fund 2003 commenced investing in 2004 and 
is now fully invested. At 31st December 2009, 80 mezzanine 
investments had been made by the fund, of which 41 had been 
realised in full and 11 investments had been partially realised. The 
investment has been written down by £1.4 million (7p per share).
3. Ono 
Ono is a Spanish cable operator in which Candover and the 
Candover 2001 Fund have a small minority interest. The company 
performed well in 2009, with profit growth driven by a focus on 
higher margin customers and good cost control. The investment 
has been written up by £0.6 million (3p per share) despite adverse 
foreign exchange movements. 
4. ICG Mezzanine Fund 2000
1
ICG Mezzanine Fund 2000 commenced investing in 2001 and 
is now fully invested. At 31st December 2009, 51 mezzanine 
investments had been made by the fund, of which 46 had been 
realised in full and one investment had been fully repaid but not 
realised. The investment has been written down by £0.4 million  
(2p per share).
5. Hilding Anders
Hilding Anders is a European and Asian manufacturer of beds and 
mattresses. The company has diverse products and operations, 
selling both branded and private label products and operates in 
40 countries. Since the buyout in December 2006, the company 
has grown both organically and through the acquisition of eight 
geographically diverse bed manufacturers. However, demand 
for beds and mattresses is impacted by prevailing economic 
conditions and consumer confidence and consequently demand 
has softened. Despite this, profits were ahead of prior year driven 
by lower raw material prices and operational improvements. The 
company agreed a new capital structure in November and in doing 
so, significantly reduced leverage. The valuation is retained at nil, 
although we have written back the provision against a future equity 
commitment of £2.1 million (10p per share) in full. 
1 This investment is made by the Company outside of the Candover Funds
6. Technogym 
Technogym is a global leader in the design and manufacture of 
premium branded fitness equipment and wellness solutions and 
enjoys strong brand recognition internationally. The long-term 
fundamentals underpinning growth, such as health awareness, 
remain intact. However, the business has suffered from a lack of 
commercial finance as well as weak economic conditions, with a 
number of key customers deferring the replacement of equipment 
and the opening of new gym facilities. The short-term outlook 
remains challenging and as a result our investment remains valued 
at nil, with no adjustment to the £12.2 million (56p per share) 
provided against a future equity commitment. 
7. DX Group
DX Group is one of the largest independent end-to-end operators 
in the UK postal market offering mail solutions for both businesses 
and the secure mail market. Key customers include property 
lawyers, financial institutions, national and local government 
agencies and credit card companies, all of which have been 
adversely impacted by the recession in the UK. Given the significant 
impact of the recession on trading, the company is in the process  
of restructuring its balance sheet and as a result the valuation 
remains at zero.
8. Gala Coral
Gala Coral is one of the leading integrated betting and gaming 
groups in Europe, with strong market positions in licensed betting 
shops, bingo clubs and casinos and a high quality multimedia 
offering. Group trading has been impacted by the recession as well 
as the ongoing effect of the smoking ban in England and Wales. 
As a result, the business is currently being restructured and the 
investment continues to be valued at zero.
9. Candover 2001 Fund carried interest
Candover’s share of the Candover 2001 Fund carried interest was 
valued at £27.9 million (2008: £19.2 million).
Conclusion
In conclusion, the majority of the investee companies are 
performing well and we will continue to focus on maximising value 
throughout the portfolio over the course of 2010 and beyond.

Valuation policy
Investments have been valued by Candover Partners Limited in 
compliance with the principles of IAS 39 Financial Instruments: 
Recognition and Measurement and the International Private Equity 
and Venture Capital Valuation Guidelines as recommended by the 
British Venture Capital Association (“the BVCA”).
Principles of valuation of unlisted investments 
Investments are stated at amounts considered by Candover 
Partners to be a reasonable assessment of their fair value, subject 
to the requirement to apply a degree of caution in making the 
necessary estimates. Fair value is the amount at which an asset 
could be exchanged between knowledgeable, willing parties in 
an arm’s length transaction. In estimating fair value, Candover 
Partners use a methodology which is appropriate in light of 
the nature, facts and circumstances of the investment and its 
materiality in the context of the total investment portfolio.
Investments are valued on one of the bases described below. 
Typically, the earnings multiple basis of valuation will be used 
unless this is inappropriate, as in the case of certain asset-based 
businesses.
When valuing on an earnings basis, profits before interest and 
tax of the current year will normally be used. Such profits will be 
adjusted to a maintainable basis and multiplied by an appropriate 
and reasonable earnings multiple normally related to comparable 
quoted companies, with adjustments made for points of difference 
between the comparator and the company being valued, in 
particular for risks, earnings growth prospects and surplus 
assets or excess liabilities. In addition, factors such as the likely 
timing of an exit, the influence over that exit, the risk of achieving 
conditions precedent to that exit and general market conditions 
are considered when evaluating the price/earnings multiple.
Where a company has incurred losses, or if comparable quoted 
companies are not primarily valued on an earnings basis, then 
the valuation may be calculated with regard to the underlying net 
assets and any other relevant information, such as the pricing for 
subsequent recent investments by a third party that is deemed 
to be at arm’s length. In cases where an exit is actively being 
sought, any offers from potential purchasers would be relevant 
in assessing the valuation of an investment and are taken into 
account in arriving at the valuation.
When investments have obtained an exit (either by listing or trade 
sale) after the valuation date but before finalisation of the accounts 
of the relevant Candover managed funds, the valuation is based 
on the exit valuation subject to an appropriate discount to take 
account of the time period between the valuation and exit dates.
In arriving at the value of an investment, the percentage 
ownership is calculated after considering any potential dilution 
through outstanding warrants, options and performance related 
mechanisms.
Principles of valuation of listed investments 
Investments are valued at the bid price last recorded on the 
statement of financial position date without discount.
Valuation procedures
Valuations prepared by Candover Partners are initially prepared 
by its finance department using comparables sourced from an 
independent third party and financial results provided directly by 
the investee companies. These are then passed to the relevant 
investment executive for review and comment, in particular with 
respect to the sustainability of earnings and completeness of 
underlying debt, the comparables and any adjustments to be 
made thereto for points of difference. Any changes to earnings 
basis or comparables used in a valuation, compared to the prior 
valuation, must be approved by the senior management  
of Candover Partners.
These valuations are then subject to review and challenge by  
the senior management of Candover Partners, who at the same 
time will discuss the underlying trading and outlook, both internal  
and external, of the investee company.
The valuations are subject to approval by the board of directors 
of Candover Partners and are audited by the auditor of the third 
party funds of Candover Partners (separate auditors to those of 
the Company).
In conjunction with this process, the auditors of the Company 
also audit the valuations and Candover Partners presents the 
valuations of the investee companies to the Board of Directors  
of the Company for its approval. Candover

Report of the Directors
The Directors present their report containing statutory and 
corporate governance information together with the audited 
financial statements for the year ended 31st December 2009.
Principal activities
Candover Investments plc is a mid-market private equity investment 
business. The main activity of the Company is to invest in private 
equity transactions. The activities of its principal subsidiary, 
Candover Partners Limited, are to raise, invest and manage, on 
behalf of third parties, private equity funds (the “Candover Funds”) 
alongside which the Company makes co-investments in line with 
a commitment agreed at the outset of each fund. The Company’s 
investment policy is set out below. 
Tax and investment company status
The Company is an investment company within the meaning of 
section 833 of the Companies Act 2006. In addition, Her Majesty’s 
Revenue and Customs has approved the Company’s status as an 
investment trust under section 842 of the Income and Corporation 
Taxes Act 1988 for the year ended 31st December 2008. In the 
opinion of the Directors, the Company’s affairs since that date have 
been conducted so as to enable it to continue to be treated as an 
investment trust.
Regulation
The Company’s wholly-owned subsidiary, Candover Partners 
Limited, is regulated by the Financial Services Authority under the 
Financial Services and Markets Act 2000. 
Investment policy and strategy
The Company is an investment company which aims to provide 
its shareholders with quoted access to private equity returns. 
Currently, its main focus is making unquoted equity and/or debt  
co-investments alongside the Candover Funds. In recent years 
the Candover Funds have concentrated on mid-to-large European 
buyouts with an enterprise value in excess of m500 million, although 
investments have also been made in smaller businesses. 
The Company’s co-investments with the Candover Funds are 
generally structured with a mixture of debt and shareholders’ equity 
with a view to maximising returns whilst maintaining a sound  
capital base for the investee company. Typically, the Company 
has co-invested between m25 million and m100 million in such 
opportunities. The Company’s status as an investment trust means 
that on acquisition it will not invest more than 15% by value of its 
qualifying investments in a single company. The Company’s policy 
has been to manage its balance sheet and levels of gearing. Net 
gearing is not expected to exceed 20% of net assets over the 
investment cycle and will not be greater than 40% of net assets at 
the time any gearing is taken out. As set out in the CEO’s report on 
pages 4 to 5, with the current focus of Candover Partners Limited 
being on portfolio management and realisations, the set of key 
performance indicators for the Company has been widened. 
The Candover Funds are permitted to invest in a wide range of 
industries within Europe to ensure there is diversity in the portfolio. 
Further details of the Company’s current investment portfolio can 
be found in the Manager’s portfolio review on pages 8 to 17.
Although it is possible that from time to time Candover Partners 
Limited may require the Company to fund additional investments 
in relation to its existing co-investments, the focus of Candover 
Partners Limited in the near term will be to preserve the value of the 
investments made by the Candover Funds. 
In addition to the Company’s co-investments in the Candover 
Funds, it has also made non-parallel investments and commitments 
to other funds both inside and outside Europe. Each non-parallel 
investment is assessed on behalf of the Company by Candover 
Partners Limited. 
Investment returns and revenues
The Company’s investment returns and revenues are derived from: 
(i) Co-investment arrangements
The Company’s commitment to co-invest alongside the Candover 
Funds is set out in the co-investment agreement for each fund 
entered into between the Company, Candover Partners Limited 
(as general partner or manager of the various limited partnerships 
making up the relevant Candover Fund) and other investors. Each 
co-investment agreement requires the Company to contribute 
its proportionate share of any investment made by the relevant 
Candover Fund, but permits the Company to limit its share of 
any investment on acquisition to 15% by value of its qualifying 
investments, to avoid jeopardising the Company’s status as an 
approved investment trust. 
The Company also participates in the profits from the Candover 
Funds, subject to an overall minimum return having first been 
generated for third party investors, other than with respect to 
the Candover 2008 Fund (see below). The exact percentage 
received by the Company in respect of the Candover 2005 Fund 
will be determined by a ratchet mechanism which is based on the 
investment multiple achieved. In respect of the Candover 2001 
Fund it is a straight percentage split. 
 
Pursuant to the terms of each co-investment agreement, the 
Company cannot influence the day to day activities of Candover 
Partners Limited in managing the Candover Funds. In this regard 
and in order to discharge its fiduciary duties to its investors, 
Candover Partners Limited operates independently from the 
Company. 
(ii) Non-parallel investments 
Details of the Company’s investments made outside of the 
Candover Funds are set out on page 17. While the decision to  
make non-parallel financial investments rests with the Company, 
the day to day management of such financial investments is 
undertaken by Candover Partners Limited.
(iii) Revenues 
Candover Partners Limited earns management fees, payable  
by third party investors in the Candover Funds and the Company,  
from its activities as investment manager of the Candover Funds 
and the Company’s co-investments and non-parallel investments.
The Company earns income from interest on loan notes structured 
as part of an investment and from its cash balances. Section 1:

Report and accounts 2009 23
Management arrangements
On 1st January 2010, the Company entered into two agreements 
with Candover Partners Limited.
The first agreement is a management agreement (the “Management 
Agreement”), designed to document, on an arm’s length basis, the 
investment advisory activities which Candover Partners Limited 
carries out for the Company. The Management Agreement reflects 
the fact that the co-investments are to be managed by Candover 
Partners Limited whilst it is the manager of the Candover Funds. 
The Management Agreement can only be terminated in respect of 
any particular investment if Candover Partners Limited ceases to 
be the manager of the Candover Fund which holds that investment. 
The Management Agreement also extends to the non-parallel 
investments currently held by the Company. The Company has 
not previously had any obligation to pay fees to Candover Partners 
Limited in relation to the management of its investments but has, 
where necessary, provided its subsidiary with financial support.  
The services referred to in the Management Agreement, which  
may only be provided by an entity with certain regulatory 
authorisations, are subject to the fees payable by the Company 
which are, in summary, 1.5% of the book value of the investments 
and outstanding co-investment commitments.
The second agreement documents the provision of certain 
administrative services to the Company from Candover Partners 
Limited (the “Administrative Services Agreement”). The services 
to be provided cover support of and attendance at Board and 
shareholder meetings, preparation of accounts, completion of 
tax returns, production of compliance certificates, provision of 
secretarial services, arrangement of insurance cover, provision 
of pensions and payroll services and such other services as the 
parties may reasonably agree from time to time. The fee payable 
by the Company to Candover Partners Limited for the provision of 
these services is £250,000 per annum. The Administrative Services 
Agreement may be terminated by either party on six months’ notice.
The effect of entering into the Management Agreement and the 
Administrative Services Agreement is that the relationship between 
the Company and Candover Partners Limited is placed within a 
formal, legal and operational framework which provides clarity as  
to each party’s rights and duties to the other.
These arrangements do not affect the Company’s participation  
in the carried interest arrangements for the Candover 2001 and 
2005 Funds.
Business review
The Company’s performance during the year to 31st December 
2009, its position at that date and the Company’s future 
developments are detailed in the Chairman’s statement, the CEO’s 
report and the Manager’s portfolio review on pages 2 to 17.
Risks
A summary of the Company’s risk management framework and  
an overview of the Company’s principal operating risks are detailed 
in the Risk review on pages 36 to 39.
Results and dividends
The financial statements of the Company and its subsidiaries for  
the year to 31st December 2009 appear on pages 53 to 82.
The Group’s total recognised income and expense for the financial 
year after taxation was a loss of £9.0 million (2008: £3.8 million 
profit). Revenue was £31.9 million (2008: £41.2 million). 
Administrative expenses charged to revenue were £36.8 million 
(2008: £33.2 million). Capital return for the year was £11.3 million 
(2008: loss of £216.4 million). The changes in fixed asset investments 
are described, together with a review of Candover’s activities, in  
the Chairman’s statement, the CEO’s report, the Financial review 
and the Manager’s portfolio review on pages 2 to 17.
The Directors do not recommend the payment of a final dividend  
for 2009 (2008: final dividend of £nil).
Operations
The Company maintains an office in London and, during the year to 
31st December 2009, it closed offices in Mumbai and Hong Kong.
Candover Partners Limited operates through offices in London, 
Paris and Madrid. During the year to 31st December 2009, the 
decision was taken to close its office in Milan. 
Agreement relating to the Candover 2008 Fund
On 8th January 2010, the Company and Candover Partners Limited 
announced that an agreement had been reached with investors in 
the Candover 2008 Fund to terminate the investment period. 
The consent of 100% of investors was obtained for the 
termination of the Candover 2008 Fund and the principal terms  
of the agreement are as follows:
–  the Candover 2008 Fund’s sole investment remains Expro 
International. Candover Partners Limited led the m2.6 billion 
buyout of Expro International in July 2008, investing m195.3 
million from the Candover 2005 Fund and m305.7 million from 
the Candover 2008 Fund. The Company’s co-investment in 
Expro International was m109.4 million;
–  Candover 2008 Fund investor commitments are scaled back 
pro rata, subject to an appropriate follow-on reserve of  
m100 million which, together with follow-on financing from the 
Candover 2005 Fund, will allow Expro International to continue 
to take advantage of market opportunities. The Company will 
not contribute to this follow-on reserve; 
–  all of the other investors in the Candover 2008 Fund have 
waived any claims that they may have against the Company  
as a result of its decision not to participate in the Candover 
2008 Fund; and
–  the Company will surrender its Candover 2008 Fund carry 
entitlement to the other investors.
As a consequence, the Company will no longer make any 
investments in the Candover 2008 Fund and its future 
commitments to the Candover Funds will not exceed £80.8 million.  Candover

Information for shareholders 
(i) Articles of association 
The business of the Company shall be managed by the Board,  
which may exercise all the powers of the Company, including the 
power to issue or buy back shares, subject to the provisions of 
the Articles, relevant statutory law and any direction which may be 
given by the Company in a general meeting by special resolution.
A summary of the rights, restrictions and obligations attaching 
to the shares in the Company is set out below. Full details are 
contained in the Articles, a copy of which can be found at  
www.candoverinvestments.com. The Articles may only be  
changed by a special resolution passed by the members of the 
Company. At the forthcoming Annual General Meeting of the 
Company it is proposed that the Articles be amended. Details  
of the proposed amendments may be found in the Company’s 
notice of the Annual General Meeting.
(ii) Share capital
The Company’s share capital consists of a single class of ordinary 
shares with a nominal value of 25p each (the “Shares”), all of  
which are fully paid. As at 24th March 2010, the issued share  
capital of the Company comprised 21,856,615 Shares, of which 
78,035 Shares are held in treasury by the Company. Note 18 to  
the accounts, on page 70, sets out the details of the Company’s 
capital structure.
(iii) Major interests in Shares 
As at 24th March 2010, the Company had been notified, pursuant 
to the Disclosure and Transparency Rules of the Financial Services 
Authority, of certain significant holdings in the Company’s share 
capital. Details of members with interests of 3% or more of the 
Company’s Shares are set out in note 18 to the accounts on  
page 70.
Conflicts of interest
(i) The Board of Directors
The Companies Act 2006 sets out directors’ general duties which, 
to a great extent, codifies the previous law. These provisions came 
into force from 1st October 2008 and require that a director must 
avoid a situation where he has, or could have, a direct or indirect 
interest that conflicts, or possibly may conflict, with the Company’s 
interests. This requirement is very broad and could apply, for 
example, if a director becomes a director of another company or a 
trustee of another organisation. The Companies Act 2006 allows 
directors of public companies to authorise conflicts and potential 
conflicts, where appropriate, where the articles of association 
contain a provision to this effect and also permits the articles of 
association to contain other provisions for dealing with directors’ 
conflict of interest to avoid a breach of duty. At the Annual General 
Meeting of the Company in 2008, the Company adopted revised 
articles of association (the “Articles”) which gave the Directors  
the ability to authorise such conflicts and included other provisions 
to allow conflicts of interest to be dealt with. The Company 
has implemented various safeguards which apply when the 
Directors decide whether to authorise a conflict or potential conflict.  
Firstly, only the Directors who have no interest in the matter being 
considered will be able to take the relevant decision and, secondly, 
in taking the decision, the Directors must act in a way which they 
consider, in good faith, will be most likely to promote the Company’s 
success. The Directors are also able to impose conditions when 
authorising conflicts of interest. 
(ii) Candover Partners Limited
Candover Partners Limited is also subject to potential conflicts  
of interest. In the ordinary course of its business, Candover  
Partners Limited will manage investments on behalf of the 
Company and investors in the Candover Funds. Candover  
Partners Limited will owe fiduciary duties to its investors and is 
required to act in their best interests in managing and ultimately 
realising the investments. However, it should be noted that 
historically Candover Partners Limited has also invested alongside 
the Candover Funds in the investments. Accordingly, the individual 
executives within Candover Partners Limited may receive profits as 
and when investments are realised. Such potential conflicts  
of interest are disclosed to investors in the Candover Funds and  
the Company. The fiduciary duties owed by Candover Partners 
Limited to its investors mean that management of the investments 
is undertaken in good faith and the decision to realise any 
investment is taken by Candover Partners Limited in the best 
interests of the relevant Candover Fund as a whole.  Section 1:

Report and accounts 2009 25
(viii) Appointment of proxies
Under the Articles, members are entitled to appoint a proxy, who 
need not be a member of the Company, to exercise all or any of 
their rights to attend, speak and vote on their behalf at a general 
meeting. A member may appoint more than one proxy, provided 
each proxy is appointed to exercise rights attached to different 
Shares. If votes are to be exercised by proxy, the Articles provide 
that proxy forms must be received not less than 48 hours before the 
time appointed for the holding of the meeting. A notice of general 
meeting and accompanying proxy form explain the full method for 
voting by proxy. 
(ix) Transfers of Shares 
A member does not need to obtain the approval of the Company 
or other members in order for a transfer of Shares, whether in 
certificated or uncertificated form, to take place. Transfers of Shares 
in uncertificated form must be carried out using CREST. 
The Board may refuse to register a transfer of Shares:
–  if the Shares are not fully paid, provided that this discretion may 
not be exercised in a way which the Financial Services Authority 
or the London Stock Exchange regards as preventing dealings 
in the Shares from taking place on an open and proper basis;
–  if the transfer is in favour of more than four transferees jointly, 
whether the Shares are fully paid or not;
–  in relation to Shares in certificated form, where the provisions of 
article 42 of the Company’s Articles are not met;
–  in relation to Shares in uncertificated form, in accordance with 
the Uncertificated Securities Regulations; and
–  if the shares are Restricted Shares (as defined above in the 
section entitled “Restrictions on voting”) and represent at least 
0.25% in nominal value of the issued Shares of the same class, 
as more fully described in the Articles.
There are no other restrictions on the transfer of Shares, other than 
restrictions imposed from time to time by laws and regulations (e.g. 
insider trading laws) or pursuant to the Listing Rules of the Financial 
Services Authority (whereby certain employees of the Company 
require the approval of the Company to deal in Shares).
(x) Creditor payment policy
The Company’s policy is to negotiate payment terms with its 
suppliers on an individual basis. The Company had trade creditors 
outstanding at 31st December 2009 representing on average 
18 days (being the ratio of the number of the Company’s trade 
creditors at the end of the year to the amounts invoiced by trade 
creditors to the Company during the year).
(xi) ISA status
The Board has reviewed the ISA status of the Company’s Shares 
and for the time being considers that a decision to make Candover’s 
Shares eligible for inclusion in an ISA will impose constraints on the 
Company’s investment criteria that will not be in the overall interests 
of shareholders.
(iv) Rights attaching to Shares
The rights attaching to the Company’s Shares are set out in the 
Articles. All Shares in issue (excluding those held by the Company  
in treasury) carry equal rights. 
(v) Dividends
By passing an ordinary resolution, members may declare final 
dividends although the amount of a dividend cannot exceed that 
recommended by the Board. All Shares, excluding shares held by 
the Company in treasury, carry equal rights in respect of declared 
dividends. The Board may pay interim dividends provided that, 
in the opinion of the Board, the financial position of the Company 
justifies such payment. If authorised by an ordinary resolution of  
the members, the Board may offer any member the right to elect  
to receive new shares in the Company, which will be credited as 
fully paid, instead of their cash dividend. Any dividend which has not 
been claimed for 12 years or more after becoming due for payment 
will be forfeited and will revert to the Company.
(vi) Voting rights 
Except as described below, there are no restrictions on the voting 
rights attaching to the Company’s Shares. There are no special 
control rights in relation to the Shares and the Company is not 
aware of any agreements between members that may result in 
restrictions in voting rights. 
Subject to the Company’s Articles and to law, votes are exercisable 
at a general meeting of the Company at which the relevant 
resolutions are being heard. Votes may be exercised in person, 
by proxy, or, in the case of corporate members, by corporate 
representative, but in all cases the member must be entered on 
the register of members of the Company in respect of the relevant 
Shares at such time (not being earlier than 48 hours before the 
meeting) as may be specified by the Company in the notice of 
general meeting. 
For each resolution proposed, every member present, or otherwise 
duly represented, has one vote on a show of hands and on a poll 
has one vote for each share held. In the case of joint holders, only 
the vote of the most senior holder who votes, whether in person or 
by proxy, can be accepted. For this purpose, seniority is determined 
by the order in which the names stand in the register of members. 
(vii) Restrictions on voting
Unless the Board of Directors otherwise determines, no member 
shall be entitled to attend or vote either personally or by proxy at 
a general meeting in respect of a Share if any call or other sum 
presently payable by him to the Company in respect of such 
Share remains unpaid. In addition, no member shall be entitled to 
attend or vote, either in person or by proxy, in respect of Shares 
if he has failed to provide, within 14 days of delivery of a notice 
by the Company, information concerning interests in the Shares, 
(“Restricted Shares”).  Candover

Report of the Directors

The Walker Guidelines
During 2007, Sir David Walker published the ‘Guidelines for 
Disclosure and Transparency in Private Equity’ (the “Guidelines”), 
aimed at helping to improve understanding of the role of private 
equity within the UK economy. The Guidelines encourage private 
equity firms to comply with its recommendations, or to explain 
clearly why they have not done so. Candover supports the 
Guidelines and believes that it is fully compliant in its 2009 reporting. 
The Guidelines also stipulate that well-established valuation 
guidelines should be used by private equity firms to value their 
assets and that firms should provide data to the BVCA in support of 
its role in data gathering and economic impact analysis. Candover 
is fully compliant with the Guidelines in both these respects.
The Guidelines also place enhanced reporting requirements on 
portfolio companies meeting certain criteria (including having more 
than 50% of revenues generated in the UK and more than 1,000 full 
time equivalent UK employees). Three of our portfolio companies, 
Gala Coral, DX Group and Expro International, meet these criteria 
and have produced full year and interim year reports that satisfy the 
required standard. 
Political and charitable donations
During the year, the Company made donations totalling £169 to 
charities (2008: £500). There were no political donations made 
during the year (2008: £nil). 
Employees and employee share schemes 
Information regarding Candover’s employees and employee share 
schemes is given in note 2 to the financial statements on pages 60 
and 61 and in the Directors’ remuneration report on page 43. 
Shares in the Company may be held, from time to time, by the 
trustee of the Candover Investments SMP Trust (the “SMP Trust”) 
established in connection with the share matching plan referred 
to in the Directors’ remuneration report on page 43, which is an 
employees’ share scheme. The trustee of the SMP Trust may not 
vote shares that are held in the trust. As at 31st December 2009,  
no shares were held by the trustee of the SMP Trust.
Going concern
Under the Combined Code and applicable regulations, the 
Directors are required to satisfy themselves that it is reasonable  
to presume that the Company is a going concern. 
Candover’s business activities, together with the factors likely 
to affect its future development, performance and position, are 
set out in the Chairman’s statement, the CEO’s report and the 
Manager’s portfolio review on pages 2 to 17. The financial position 
of Candover, its cash flows, liquidity position and borrowing facilities 
are described in the Financial review on pages 6 to 7. In addition, 
the Risk review and note 25 to the financial statements on pages 36 
and 73 respectively includes Candover’s financial risk management 
objectives, its capital management policies and procedures, details 
of its financial instruments and hedging activities and its exposures 
to market risk, currency risk, interest rate risk, credit risk, liquidity 
risk and other pricing risk.
(xii) Agreements which are affected by a change of control  
of the Company
As at 24th March 2010, the Company was party to the following 
agreements which take effect after or terminate on a change of 
control of the Company following a takeover bid:
(a)  £100.0 million revolving credit facility agreement dated  
22nd October 2007 between the Company, Bayerische  
Hypo-und Vereinsbank AG and the Royal Bank of Scotland plc in 
relation to the provision of a multi-currency revolving credit facility 
to the Company. Under this agreement the Company would be 
required to promptly notify the Royal Bank of Scotland plc, in 
its capacity as agent, of any change of control of the Company. 
Any such notification would open a period of thirty days in which 
the Majority Lenders (as defined in the agreement) could elect to 
cancel the facility and declare all amounts together with accrued 
interest immediately due and payable.
(b)  Note Purchase Agreement dated 12th October 2007 between  
the Company and certain financial institutions in respect of  
(a) US$200.0 million 7.02% Series A Senior Notes due 
12th October, 2014 (b) 330.0 million Floating Rate Series B 
Senior Notes due 12th October 2014 and (c) £30.0 million 
7.45% Series C Senior Notes due 11th January 2015 (together 
the “Notes”). Under this agreement, the Company is required 
to give written notice to the holders of the Notes within 21 days 
of a change of control taking place and offer to prepay the 
entire unpaid principal amount of the Notes held by each holder 
together with interest thereon within 45 days of the Company 
issuing a change of control notice. Each Note holder is required 
to accept or reject the prepayment offer within 30 days of it being 
made by the Company.
(c)  In relation to the employee share schemes referred to in the 
Directors’ remuneration report on page 43. Awards and options 
under those schemes will vest or become exercisable upon or 
shortly after a change of control, although the number of shares 
comprised within those awards or options may be reduced.
There are no agreements between the Company and its Directors 
or employees providing for compensation for loss of office or 
employment that occurs because of a takeover bid.
Auditors
Grant Thornton UK LLP have expressed willingness to continue  
in office. In accordance with section 489(4) of the Companies  
Act 2006, a resolution to reappoint Grant Thornton UK LLP will  
be proposed at the Annual General Meeting to be held on  
20th May 2010.

Report and accounts 2009 27
Each of the Directors, whose names are recorded on pages 20  
and 21, confirms to the best of his knowledge (a) that Candover and 
the Company financial statements in this report, which have been 
prepared in accordance with applicable law and IFRSs, give a true 
and fair view of the assets, liabilities, financial position and profit of 
Candover taken as a whole; and (b) that the corporate governance 
section contained in this Report and accounts includes a fair review 
of the development and performance of the business and the position 
of the Company and Candover taken as a whole, together with a 
description of the principal risks and uncertainties that they face.
The Directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting 
records that disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the 
financial position of Candover and the Company and enable 
them to ensure that the financial statements comply with the 
Companies Act 2006 and Article 4 of the IAS Regulation. They are 
also responsible for safeguarding the assets of Candover and the 
Company and hence for taking reasonable steps for the prevention 
and detection of fraud and other irregularities.
Pursuant to section 418(2) of the Companies Act 2006, each of  
the Directors confirms that (a) so far as he is aware, there is no 
relevant audit information of which the Company’s auditors are 
unaware; and (b) he has taken all steps that he ought to have  
taken as a Director in order to make himself aware of any relevant 
audit information and to establish that the auditors are aware of that 
information.
The Directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity  
of the corporate and financial information included on the 
Company’s website. Legislation in the United Kingdom governing 
the preparation and dissemination of financial statements may  
differ from legislation in other jurisdictions.
By order of the Board
Malcolm Fallen
Chief Executive Officer 
20 Old Bailey 
London EC4M 7LN 
24th March 2010
As described in the Chairman’s statement on page 2, the past year 
has seen an improvement in the Company’s financial stability. At 
the end of 2008, Candover reported a significant drop in net asset 
value and noted that the worsening economic conditions as well as 
volatile financial markets could lead to further declines in valuation. 
In 2009, the Company took steps to reduce headcount, preserve 
cash and implemented a programme of operational cost savings. 
The Directors consider that the steps taken in 2009 to enhance 
and improve the Company’s financial position, together with the 
benefit of asset realisations by Candover Partners Limited and an 
improvement in the external environment, have been materially 
beneficial.
As explained in the Chairman’s statement on page 2 and as 
summarised on page 23, the agreement reached to terminate  
the Candover 2008 Fund and the release of the Company from  
its commitment thereto has further enhanced the Company’s 
financial position. 
Candover has confirmed that it is in full compliance with the terms 
of the US private placement bonds issued in 2007. 
As a result and after considering and taking into account the 
matters described above, the Directors have a reasonable 
expectation that Candover and the Company have adequate 
resources to continue as a going concern for the foreseeable future. 
For these reasons, they continue to adopt the going concern basis 
in preparing the Report and accounts.
Statement of Directors’ responsibilities
Company law requires the Directors to prepare financial 
statements for each financial year in accordance with International 
Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the European 
Union (“IFRSs”). The financial statements are required to give a 
true and fair view of the state of affairs of Candover and the 
Company and of the profit and loss of Candover for that period. In 
preparing these financial statements, the Directors are required to:
–  select suitable accounting policies and apply them 
consistently;
–  make judgements and estimates that are reasonable and 
prudent;
–  state whether applicable IFRSs have been followed, subject  
to any material departures disclosed and explained in the 
financial statements; and
–  prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis 
unless it is inappropriate to presume that Candover will 
continue in business. Candover 
Report and accounts 2009 28
The Combined Code sets out guidance in the form of principles  
and provisions on how companies should be directed and 
controlled to follow good corporate governance practice. The 
Financial Services Authority requires companies listed in the UK  
to disclose in relation to Section 1 of the Combined Code how  
they have applied its principles and whether they have complied 
with its provisions throughout the accounting year. In the event  
that the provisions have not been complied with, the Company 
must provide an explanation.
The Board is of the view that the Company has been fully compliant 
with the provisions set out in Section 1 of the Combined Code. 
This report explains how the Company has applied the principles 
contained in the Combined Code during 2009. Further information

Board meetings
The Board met 15 times during 2009. Some of these meetings 
were called at short notice for operational reasons which meant that 
not all of the Directors were able to attend. Attendance at Board 
meetings and Committee meetings is set out in Table 1 below.
The principal matters considered by the Board during 2009  
(in addition to matters formally reserved to the Board) included:
–  the strategic review undertaken between March and  
June 2009;
– regular reports from the Chief Executive Officer;
–  the recommendations of the Audit, Risk and Valuation 
Committee;
–  the Company’s relationship with Candover Partners  
Limited; 
–  financial reports on the performance and outlook for the 
Company including compliance with covenants and 
regulations; and
– bespoke external adviser reports.
Board information
The Board of Directors receives reports and papers in a timely 
manner which contain clear and accurate information for all Board 
and Committee meetings. Additional papers are provided to 
address specific issues from time to time.
The Board’s discussions and its approval of the Group’s strategic 
plan and annual budget, provide the non-executive directors 
with the opportunity to contribute to and validate the plans of the 
Company’s management and assist in the development of strategy. 
The non-executive directors receive regular reports and information 
which enable them to scrutinise the Company’s and management’s 
performance against agreed objectives.
The Company Secretary
The Board of Directors has access to the advice and services of 
the Company Secretary, who is responsible for advising the Board, 
through the Chairman, on governance matters. The Articles and 
the schedule of matters reserved to the Board or its duly authorised 
Committees for decision provide that the appointment and removal 
of the Company Secretary is a matter for the full Board.
A
  
The Board: How do we ensure that the Company is 
headed by an effective and collectively responsible 
Board of Directors?
The Board of Directors is responsible to shareholders for ensuring 
that the Company is appropriately managed and that it meets its 
objectives. The Board of Directors meets regularly to determine the 
Company’s strategic direction and review its financial performance, 
to examine the performance of Candover Partners Limited, the 
manager of the Company’s investments, and to provide oversight  
of the appropriate operating controls.
The Board has approved terms of reference that address a wide 
range of corporate governance matters. The terms of reference 
contain a formal schedule of matters reserved to the Board of 
Directors and its duly authorised Committees for decision.  
These include:
– approval of the Company’s overall strategy and business plans;
–  approval of the Company’s half-yearly and annual financial 
statements and changes in the Group’s accounting policies or 
practices;
– valuation of the Company’s investments;
– changes relating to the capital structure of the Company;
– dividend policy;
–  investments and divestments in the ordinary course of business 
above certain limits set by the Board from time to time;
– appointments to the Board; and
– constitution of Board Committees.
Matters delegated by the Board to management include 
implementation of the Board approved strategy, day to day 
management of the business and the formulation and execution of 
risk management policies and practices. The schedule of matters 
reserved to the Board is available on the Company’s website.

 Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: How does  
the Company ensure that no one individual has 
unfettered powers of decision?
The division of responsibilities between the Chairman of the Board 
and the Chief Executive Officer is clearly defined and has been 
approved by the Board. The Chairman’s priority is the leadership 
of the Board and the Chief Executive Officer’s priority is the 
management of the Company.
The Chairman
Gerry Grimstone in his role as Chairman leads the Board in the 
determination of strategy. The Chairman is responsible for organising 
the business of the Board, setting its agenda and ensuring the 
effectiveness of the overall Board and the individual Directors. 
Given the non-executive nature of the role, the Chairman has no 
involvement in the day to day business of the Company. 
The Chief Executive Officer
Malcolm Fallen in his role as Chief Executive Officer is accountable 
to the Board for reviewing and considering strategic options for the 
Company, for managing the financial and operational performance 
of the Company and assisting the Board in executing the Company’s 
strategy. The Chief Executive Officer is, in particular, responsible 
for the day to day management of the Company’s relationship with 
Candover Partners Limited, as manager of the Company’s  
co-investments. Together with the Chairman, he provides leadership 
of the Company including representing the Group to all stakeholders.
Senior Independent Director
Pursuant to the Combined Code, the Board has appointed one of 
the non-executive directors to act as Senior Independent Director. 
The main role of the Senior Independent Director is to be available 
to shareholders should they have concerns that they have been 
unable to resolve through normal channels or when such channels 
would be inappropriate. The Senior Independent Director is also 
responsible for leading the Board’s discussion on the Chairman’s 
performance and the appointment of a new Chairman, when 
appropriate. 
Throughout 2009, Antony Hichens served as Senior Independent 
Director, to whom, in accordance with the Combined Code 
concerns were able to be conveyed. Mr Hichens will retire and  
will be replaced as Senior Independent Director by Lord Jay at  
the forthcoming Annual General Meeting of the Company to be  
held on 20th May 2010.
  
2
   
 Board balance and independence: How do  
we ensure that no individual or small group of  
individuals can dominate decision making by  
the Board of Directors?
At this year’s Annual General Meeting, three Directors will retire  
and the Board considers that, together with the decision taken 
during 2009 to appoint a full time Chief Executive Officer, the 
reduced composition is appropriate to the Company’s status. 
 
It is the Board’s view that each Director is independent in character 
and judgement and that no Director has any relationships that could 
materially interfere with his judgement. None of the Directors have 
been interested in any contract or arrangement subsisting during  
or at the end of the financial period that was significant in relation 
to the business of the Company. All of the non-executive directors 
were considered by the Board to be independent for the purposes 
of the Combined Code in the year to 31st December 2009, save for 
the Chairman, who was independent on appointment, and Antony 
Hichens who have both exceeded the nine year period of service 
envisaged by the Combined Code as being potentially relevant to 
the determination of a non-executive director’s independence. In 
this regard, the Board acknowledges the Association of Investment 
Companies’ guidelines on corporate governance which do 
not recommend that long serving directors be prevented from 
forming part of an independent majority. Antony Hichens, who has 
submitted himself for re-election at each Annual General Meeting 
since May 2004, has announced his intention to retire as a director 
at the forthcoming Annual General Meeting of the Company 
together with Nicholas Jones and Chris Russell.

 Performance evaluation: How do we formally 
evaluate the performance of the Board,  
Committees and individual Directors?
During 2009, the Board evaluated the performance of the Board, 
its Committees and the individual Directors in compliance with the 
Combined Code, including the Directors who have been proposed 
for re-election and election. The Chairman led the process using 
a pre-determined template and met with each of the Directors 
to ascertain their views on the functioning of the Board and the 
various Board Committees. In addition, the Chairman reviewed the 
performance commitment and contribution of each Director. 
Following discussions with the other Directors, the Senior 
Independent Director reviews the performance of the Chairman. 
The Board considers that there is no need to appoint an 
independent third party to manage the evaluation exercise as  
the current process is appropriate.
    
Re-election: How does the Company ensure  
planned and progressive refreshing of the Board?
The Board currently comprises the Chairman, six non-executive 
directors and one executive director. Biographical details for all  
of the Directors are set out on pages 20 and 21.
Each Director is required to be elected by shareholders at the 
Annual General Meeting following his appointment by the Board 
and to be re-elected once every three years. Any Director who has 
served on the Board for more than nine years is to submit himself for 
re-election annually. In addition to fulfilling their legal responsibilities, 
the Directors are expected to bring an independent judgement to 
bear on issues of strategy, performance, resources and standards 
of conduct and to help the Chairman and the Chief Executive 
Officer provide the Company with effective leadership. 
Directors’ employment contracts
Details of the Directors’ employment contracts and letters of 
appointment are set out in the Directors’ remuneration report  
on page 46.

 Appointments to the Board: How do we ensure that 
there is a formal, rigorous and transparent procedure 
for the appointment of new directors to the Board?
The purpose of the Nominations Committee is to assist the Board 
in reviewing the composition of the Board and following a thorough 
process when making or renewing appointments of Directors to  
the Board. 
The Nominations Committee is chaired by Antony Hichens  
and comprises Gerry Grimstone, Lord Jay and Richard Stone.  
All the current members of the Committee are independent  
non-executive directors, excluding the Chairman of the Board,  
who was independent on appointment as Chairman of the Board  
in 2004. The Board is satisfied that members of the Committee  
and the Committee Chairman, Antony Hichens, have recent  
and relevant experience. Gerry Grimstone will succeed Antony 
Hichens as Chairman of the Committee at the forthcoming Annual 
General Meeting.
The Committee met on one occasion in 2009 (2008: two meetings) 
and the members’ attendance record is set out in the report on  
page 29. The Company Secretary acts as the secretary to the 
Committee and meetings are attended by the Chief Executive Officer.
During the year, following an external search prior to his initial 
interim appointment, the Nominations Committee considered and 
recommended the appointment of Malcolm Fallen as the Chief 
Executive Officer of the Company. Malcolm Fallen’s appointment is 
subject to his election at the forthcoming Annual General Meeting. 
The terms of reference of the Committee are available on the 
Company’s website.
    
Information and professional development:  
How do we induct and regularly inform our Board  
of Directors?
The Board believes that the Company’s Directors should develop 
their skills and knowledge through participation in relevant training 
courses. On appointment, all non-executive directors have 
discussions with the Chairman and the Chief Executive Officer 
following which appropriate briefings on the responsibilities of 
directors, the Company’s business and the Company’s procedures 
are arranged. The Company provides opportunities for non-
executive directors to obtain a thorough understanding of the 
Company’s business by regularly meeting members of the senior 
management team of Candover Partners Limited.

Financial reporting: How do we ensure that the  
Board of Directors presents a balanced and 
understandable view of the Company’s position  
and prospects?
The Directors are required to explain their responsibility for the 
financial statements and this statement is given on page 27. The 
auditors review the Company’s compliance with the provisions  
of the Combined Code and with the rules of the Financial Services 
Authority and are also required to report on their audit of the 
financial statements. Their report is on page 48.
The Board seeks to provide investors with a balanced and  
clear view of the Company’s position and its future prospects. 
Further information is given in the Chairman’s statement, the  
CEO’s report and the Manager’s portfolio review on pages 2  
to 17.
    
 Internal control: What does the Board of Directors  
do to maintain a sound system of internal control?
 
The Board is required annually to review the effectiveness of the 
Company’s key internal controls including its financial, operational 
and compliance controls and risk management. The controls 
are designed to ensure that the risk of failure to achieve business 
objectives is managed rather than eliminated and are intended to 
provide reasonable rather than absolute assurance against material 
misstatement or loss.
Through its regular meetings and the meetings of its various 
Committees, the Board seeks to maintain full and effective control 
over all strategic, financial, regulatory and operational issues. The 
Board maintains an organisational and committee structure with 
clearly defined lines of responsibility and delegation of authorities. 
The Chief Executive Officer of the Company and the Managing 
Partner of Candover Partners Limited have, as part of the 
compilation of the risk registers for the Company and Candover 
Partners Limited respectively, ensured that appropriate 
consideration has been given to the relevant control processes 
within the respective companies and that risk is considered, 
assessed and managed as an integral part of the business.

Level and make-up of remuneration: How do we 
ensure that executive Directors’ remuneration links 
rewards to corporate and individual performance?
Our remuneration policy focuses on long-term performance. It is 
designed to ensure that we provide remuneration at the median 
level of our comparator group but with the opportunity to reward 
exceptional business performance with upper quartile total 
compensation. The Director’s remuneration report on pages  
41 to 46 summarises the remuneration policy and strategy.  
The report details the Committee’s activities over the financial  
year and contains details of Director’s emoluments.
    
 Procedure: What is our procedure for developing 
policy on executive remuneration?
The purpose of the Remuneration Committee is to assist the Board 
in determining the remuneration policy of the Company and the 
levels of compensation across Candover. 
The Remuneration Committee is chaired by Richard Stone and 
comprises Gerry Grimstone, Lord Jay, Antony Hichens, Chris 
Russell, Nicholas Jones and Jan Oosterveld. All the current 
members of the Committee are independent non-executive 
directors. The Board is satisfied that members of the Committee 
and the Committee Chairman, Richard Stone, have recent and 
relevant experience. Jan Oosterveld will succeed Richard Stone  
as Chairman of the Committee at the forthcoming Annual  
General Meeting.
The Committee met on three occasions in 2009 (2008: one 
meeting) and the members’ attendance record is set out in the 
report on page 29. The Company Secretary acts as the secretary to 
the Committee and meetings are attended by the Chief Executive 
Officer, other than when the Committee considers matters relating 
to the Chief Executive Officer’s remuneration.
The procedure for determining executive remuneration is stated  
in the Committee’s terms of reference which are available on the 
Company’s website.

Candover 
Report and accounts 2009 33
Candover’s system of internal control includes, inter alia, the 
overall control environment, the procedures for identification and 
evaluation of business risk, the control procedures themselves and 
the review of these internal controls by the Audit, Risk and Valuation 
Committee on behalf of the Board. Each of these elements that 
make up the Company’s system of internal control is explained in 
further detail below:
(i) Control environment 
Candover is dependent upon the quality and integrity of the 
Company’s staff and management and highly qualified and able 
staff have been selected at all levels. Employees are recruited when 
appropriate in order to aid the Company’s development and growth 
and members of staff are aware of the internal controls relevant to 
their activities and are also collectively accountable for the operation 
of those controls. Appropriate segregation and delegation of duties 
is in place.
On behalf of the Board, the Company’s management in conjunction 
with the Company’s auditors, Grant Thornton UK LLP , and the 
auditors of the managed funds, KPMG LLP , carry out an external 
review of the Company’s financial controls and also those of the 
funds which Candover manages. KPMG LLP and Grant Thornton 
UK LLP carry out their review only to the extent necessary to give 
their audit opinions.
(ii) Identification and evaluation of business risks 
The key business risk at Candover remains the performance of the 
Company’s investments which is managed by regular analysis and 
reporting of business risks in relation to each portfolio company and 
the taking of appropriate action to protect the investments.
Whilst there remain a range of operational risks, the investment risk 
is paramount.
(iii) Key procedures
In addition to the above, the Board’s key procedures involve:
–  a comprehensive system for reporting financial results to the 
Board five times per year (and more if appropriate) which 
provides actual results compared to budget and prior year. 
Towards the end of each financial year, detailed budgets for the 
following year are prepared and are reviewed by the Board;
–  a review of these financial controls which is carried out on 
behalf of the Audit, Risk and Valuation Committee twice a year 
and by Candover’s external auditors to the extent necessary for 
expressing their audit opinion; and
–  a twice yearly review of investment valuations by the Board 
including reports on the underlying investment performance.
Although no system of internal control can provide absolute 
assurance against material misstatement or loss, the Company’s 
system is designed to assist the Directors in obtaining reasonable 
assurance that problems are identified on a timely basis and dealt 
with appropriately.
The Company, through a function of its size, does not have an 
internal audit function. 
It is the view of the Board that the controls in relation to the 
Company’s operating, accounting, compliance and IT risks 
performed robustly throughout the year. In addition, all staff have 
been in full compliance with the Company’s policies and external 
regulations, including:
– PA dealing;
– money laundering;
– treatment and handling of confidential information;
– Listing Rules;
– applicable Financial Services Authority regulations;
– compliance policies;
– conflicts of interest; and
– health and safety.
The Company’s whistleblowing policy is in the process of review 
(there were no protected disclosures made during the year to  
31st December 2009).
In summary, the Board considers that the Company’s existing 
internal controls, coupled with the analysis of risks inherent in the 
business models of the Company and its subsidiaries provide 
appropriate tools for the Company to monitor, evaluate and mitigate 
its operating risks. 
    
 Audit Committee and auditors: How does the Board 
of Directors formally apply the financial reporting  
and internal control principles?
The purpose of the Audit, Risk and Valuation Committee is to assist 
the Board in discharging its responsibilities for the integrity of the 
Company’s financial statements, and in assessing the effectiveness  
of the Company’s internal controls and the objectivity of external 
auditors. 
The Audit, Risk and Valuation Committee is chaired by Chris Russell 
and comprises Lord Jay, Antony Hichens, Richard Stone, Nicholas 
Jones and Jan Oosterveld. All the members of the Committee are 
independent non-executive directors. The Board is satisfied that 
members of the Committee and the Committee Chairman, Chris 
Russell, have recent and relevant financial experience. Richard 
Stone will succeed Chris Russell as Chairman of the Committee at 
the Company’s forthcoming Annual General Meeting.

Corporate governance
continued
The Committee met on four occasions in 2009 (2008: five meetings) 
and the members’ attendance record is set out in the report on 
page 29. The Company Secretary acts as the secretary to the 
Committee and meetings are attended by the Chairman of the 
Company and the Chief Executive Officer.
During the year, the Committee reviewed, in conjunction with 
the external auditors, the Company’s accounting disclosures 
comprised in the half-yearly and annual financial statements of 
the Company, the scope of the annual audit plan and the external 
audit findings. The Committee exercised its judgment to ensure 
that this information was presented fairly and objectively and 
that appropriate accounting policies were applied and observed. 
The Committee reviewed the risk register of the Company and 
Candover Partners Limited. It also examined the Company’s 
compliance with its regulatory requirements, third party liabilities 
and off balance sheet liabilities and received reports on compliance 
with the terms of its loan notes.
The Committee reviewed the valuation of the Company’s 
investment assets. The Committee oversaw the Company’s 
relations with the external auditors including assessing auditor 
performance, independence and objectivity, recommending the 
auditors’ reappointment and approving the auditors’ fees.
The terms of reference of the Committee are available on the 
Company’s website.
Auditors’ independence and objectivity
Subject to annual appointment by shareholders, auditor 
performance is monitored on an ongoing basis and formally 
reviewed every five years, the last review being held during the year 
to 31st December 2009. Following this review the Audit, Risk and 
Valuation Committee concluded that Grant Thornton UK LLP’s 
appointment as the Company’s auditors should be continued.
The Audit, Risk and Valuation Committee recognises the 
importance of ensuring the independence and objectivity of the 
Company’s auditors. It reviews the nature and extent of the services 
provided by them, the level of their fees and the element comprising 
non-audit fees.
The Audit, Risk and Valuation Committee Chairman is notified 
of all assignments allocated to Grant Thornton UK LLP over a 
set threshold, other than those related to due diligence within 
the Company’s investment process where the team engaged 
would be independent of the audit team. Safeguards have been 
put in place to reduce the likelihood of compromising auditor 
independence, including the following principles which are 
applied in respect of services provided by the auditors and  
other accounting firms and monitored by the Audit, Risk and 
Valuation Committee:
–  services required to be undertaken by the auditors, which 
include regulatory returns, formalities relating to borrowings, 
shareholders and other auditors;
–  services which it is most efficient for the auditors to provide.  
However, while corporate tax services would typically fall 
within this category, such work is not normally allocated to the 
auditors because it may compromise their independence; and 
–  services that could be provided by a number of firms, including 
general consultancy work. All significant consultancy projects 
are normally put out to tender and work would be allocated to 
the auditors only if it did not present a potential threat to the 
independence of the audit team. Included in this category is 
due diligence work relating to the investment process. If this 
service were to be provided by Grant Thornton UK LLP , the 
specific team engaged would be independent of the audit team.
The Company paid £0.2 million to Grant Thornton UK LLP  
for audit services during the year to 31st December 2009 relating 
to the statutory audit of the Company’s financial statements and 
the audit of the Company’s subsidiaries and associates pursuant 
to legislation (2008: £0.2 million). The fees are explained in further 
detail in note 2 to the accounts on page 62. Section 1:

 Constructive use of the Annual General Meeting:  
How does the Board of Directors use its Annual 
General Meeting to communicate with investors  
and encourage their participation?
The Company uses the Annual General Meeting as an  
opportunity to communicate with its shareholders. At each  
Annual General Meeting, the Company complies with the 
Combined Code as it relates to voting, the separation of resolutions 
and the attendance of Committee Chairmen. The Chairmen of 
the Remuneration, Audit, Risk and Valuation and Nominations 
Committees are available to answer shareholders’ questions and 
shareholders are invited to meet the Directors after the conclusion 
of the formal business of the meeting. In accordance with the 
requirements of the Combined Code, the results of proxy voting 
by shareholders, including votes withheld, are made available to 
shareholders on request and are placed on the Company’s website 
following the Annual General Meeting. 
The Report and accounts of the Company together with its  
interim reports, interim management statements and all other  
public announcements are designed to present a balanced  
and understandable summary of the Company’s activities and  
are made available on the Company’s website.

 Dialogue with institutional shareholders: How does 
the Board of Directors ensure that a satisfactory 
dialogue with shareholders takes place?
The Board of Directors recognises the importance of maintaining 
a meaningful relationship with the Company’s shareholders. 
The Directors consider it important to understand the views of 
shareholders and any issues which are of concern to them. The 
Chairman and Chief Executive Officer meet with the Company’s 
principal institutional shareholders to discuss relevant issues as they 
arise and ensure that shareholders are apprised of the Company’s 
strategy and corporate governance within the constraints of 
information that has been made public.
The Board of Directors receives reports from the Company’s 
brokers on shareholder issues. Non-executive directors are invited 
to attend the Company’s presentations to analysts and are offered 
the opportunity to meet shareholders.
The Senior Independent Director is available to be contacted by 
shareholders in situations where contact through the Chairman is 
felt to be inappropriate. 
The Company has taken full advantage of the relevant provisions 
of the Companies Act 2006 allowing communications to be made 
electronically to shareholders where they have not requested hard 
copy information. Therefore, the Company’s website is the primary 
method for information sharing with investors. 
The Company’s share capital and information for shareholders is 
described in the Report of the Directors on pages 24 to 26.

Risk review
Assessing and identifying risk
Introduction
The Directors consider that in managing the Company’s risk profile 
it is appropriate to analyse risks inherent in the business model. 
As already noted in the Chairman’s statement on page 2, the 
traditional private equity model has undergone significant stress in 
the last year and, whilst the Company has been faced by discrete 
challenges, many of the industry-wide issues have been relevant.
The risk level within private equity as an asset class is inherently 
higher than some other asset classes reflecting the opportunity 
to earn potentially higher rewards. However, in looking at how to 
mitigate some of the risks, such as through the use of derivatives, 
the Directors believe this could significantly affect the potential 
returns available. 
Risk review
The Company has therefore conducted a review of risks affecting 
its business. The approach taken was to (i) categorise areas of 
risk, (ii) identify individual material risks and (iii) evaluate the inherent 
impact of that risk before the controls are applied. The Directors 
identified existing controls in relation to each risk and the extent to 
which such controls acted as effective mitigants. In addition, actions 
designed to enhance controls have been identified and executives 
within Candover are now responsible for each action. The analysis 
highlighted which risks are inherent to private equity and those which 
are foreseeable and avoidable and therefore could, to a greater 
extent, be eliminated. The risk review also noted that whilst the overall 
risk profile for the Company was not inherently severe, the ability to 
mitigate risks inherent in the private equity asset class was limited.

Risk mitigation
The Company has improved its financial stability in 2009 and in 
doing so, Candover Partners Limited has been able to retain and 
motivate appropriate staff to manage and maximise the value of 
its investments. Financial instability of the Company or Candover 
Partners Limited could arise from a lack of liquidity or the inability 
to retain appropriate staff. Through the arrangements set out 
in the Management Agreement we have established improved 
transparency and reporting, enabling better risk management of 
the Company’s liquidity position. As part of the restructuring of 
Candover Partners Limited we have re-allocated and amended the 
basis of various elements of the remuneration that is designed to 
retain and motivate the management team. 
 
The regulation of the financial services industry has suffered 
increased focus from policy makers and central banks in recent 
years. It is likely that this trend will continue and, while not 
presenting a systemic risk, it is likely that directly and indirectly the 
private equity industry will face further regulatory scrutiny. Future 
regulatory changes may be far reaching and may impact both 
the private equity industry and the Company’s business model 
negatively. The Company fully appreciates the potential risk that 
such changes may have on its operations and its ability to generate 
sustainable returns for its investors. The Company therefore seeks 
to influence potential regulatory changes by lobbying through trade 
organisations (e.g. BVCA, EVCA, AIC) to ensure that its views with 
regard to regulatory change are communicated and understood. 
 
Given that private equity is a relatively risky and volatile asset class, 
coupled with the tightening regulatory environment with regard to 
private equity, the Company recognises that investors will require 
above average returns. It achieves this by ensuring that Candover 
Partners Limited is well resourced and capitalised to attract talented 
staff and that its team is focused on extracting maximum value from 
the investment portfolio. Candover Partners Limited also maintains 
frequent and transparent dialogue with investors. Candover 
Partners Limited seeks to maximise returns from legacy funds to 
enhance its track record for future fund raising. By virtue of its listed 
investment trust status, the Company is able to provide investors 
with liquidity that is not open to investors in certain other closed 
private equity investment vehicles. The Company continues to work 
with industry bodies to ensure that investors are made aware of the 
attractions of private equity. Candover

Risk mitigation
The Company’s financial position together with investment 
valuations, sensitivity testing and forecast covenant compliance are 
regularly reported to and reviewed by the Board of Directors. The 
Company may use a variety of hedging techniques to manage its 
valuation, currency and interest rate exposures and it manages its 
costs and working capital effectively. Candover Partners Limited 
reports realisations and investments to the Company and investors 
in the Candover Funds on a timely and regular basis. 
 
In addition to ensuring that its team has the appropriate skill 
set, Candover Partners Limited utilises a number of techniques 
to ensure that the performance of the Company’s investments 
is continuously monitored. The team of investment executives 
at Candover Partners Limited operate in a transparent and 
open environment where decisions that are taken in relation to 
investments are rigorously analysed and evaluated. Candover 
Partners Limited ensures that portfolio companies have strong 
management teams which are appropriately incentivised. Candover 
Partners Limited has the ability to use external consultants where 
appropriate to support the creation of value. 
 
Historically, Candover Partners Limited has managed funds in 
which the Company has co-invested. Following the termination of 
the Candover 2008 Fund, there is no existing Candover Fund that is 
open for new investment. Together with Candover Partners Limited, 
the Company is exploring various options to ensure an enduring 
business which creates value for all of Candover’s investors. 
 
When structuring the portfolio, Candover Partners Limited will 
comply with applicable law and regulation which ensures that the 
Company’s investment trust status is not breached. Candover 
Partners Limited will also observe the relevant provisions of the 
limited partnership agreements which summarise the investment 
policy for the relevant Candover Fund. While portfolio concentration 
increases as investments are realised, the Company’s cash 
reserves are also increased as proceeds are received. Based on 
regular reports from Candover Partners Limited, the Company 
is able to monitor the valuations of its portfolio companies 
and continuously assess and monitor the degree of portfolio 
concentration. Section 1:

Risk mitigation
The Company has detailed management and administrative 
arrangements in place with Candover Partners Limited which 
provide a contractual framework for the provision of certain 
business support services. The arrangements clearly delineate 
responsibilities and refer to appropriate procedures and processes 
that are required to be observed in the management of the 
Company’s investments. Candover Partners Limited is able to 
manage such processes using key performance indicators and 
documented procedures. The relevant systems are frequently 
tested and annual disaster recovery/business continuity exercises 
are undertaken. In addition, Candover Partners Limited ensures 
continuous adherence to appropriate controls and processes 
through a combination of regular verification and staff training. 
 
Candover Partners Limited hires the best qualified staff to manage 
the Company’s investments and support the Company’s ongoing 
business operations. On joining Candover, all staff receive 
appropriate training and have opportunities to expand their skill 
set to enable them to perform effectively. Staff are subject to a 
programme of regular monitoring and performance appraisal. The 
Company believes that staff are competitively compensated and 
that the compensation structures provide appropriate long-term 
incentives for staff to continue to perform at a high level and remain 
loyal to the Company. 
 
  Candover 
Report and accounts 2009 40
Introduction
The goal of long-term success of our business requires the 
Company to manage its financial and non-financial activities 
effectively. The Company’s future relies in particular on maintaining 
strong positive relationships with our stakeholders, including our 
shareholders, investors, our wholly-owned subsidiary, Candover 
Partners Limited, and the management and staff of those 
companies that comprise the Candover Funds.
The Company ensures that we are a reasonable and fair employer 
and we comply with all the relevant legislation. We maintain good 
relationships with our business partners and portfolio companies.
Our principal social impacts and the consequent risks and 
opportunities arise in the portfolio companies which operate in 
a diverse range of sectors and countries. Candover does not 
manage these businesses directly but nevertheless we recognise 
the responsibilities that flow from our ownership and our strategic 
involvement with the companies’ boards. 
Until 2008, the Company was a consistent and major investor in 
the funds managed by Candover Partners Limited. However, as 
a co-investor, there are commercial and legal considerations that 
limit the influence the Company can exert on the funds managed by 
Candover Partners Limited. We consider that we have an open and 
transparent dialogue with Candover Partners Limited in relation to 
its management activities and we remain focused on ensuring that 
non-financial issues do not impact negatively on the Company’s 
reputation. We also support and, where appropriate, engage with 
relevant industry associations to promote greater understanding and 
awareness of non-financial issues within the investment community.
We are of the view that the environmental and social impact of 
Candover’s activities is relatively low and we remain keen to  
reduce the environmental impact of our portfolio companies  
where possible.
CSR principles affecting Candover
Employees
Candover endeavours to recruit, train and retain the highest calibre 
employees and to foster a work environment that helps our staff to 
develop their talents and skills. Accordingly, we aim to provide our 
staff with:
–  a supportive work environment and corporate culture; and
–  appropriate training and development.
Investors
Candover is keen to ensure that our business activities take into 
account the concerns of our investors. We strive to:
–  ensure a high standard of corporate governance; and
–  address the investors’ environmental, social and governance 
concerns.
Funds in which we invest
Our objective is to develop strong relationships with our 
stakeholders, balancing the legitimate needs of Candover 
Partners Limited with our interests and the expectations of our 
investors. We aim to do this by:
–   ensuring the highest levels of integrity in our relationships with 
Candover Partners Limited; and
–  undertaking early and constructive engagement on environmental, 
social and governance issues of legitimate concern to our investors.
Making a difference when we can
Historically, the Company has been an active and vocal supporter  
of charities. Given the Company’s financial situation during 2009, 
the Board did not feel able to make charitable donations.  
 
Environment 
The Company seeks, where possible, to lessen the environmental 
impact of its business activities. This is achieved by:
–  reducing the impact of our travel and energy use; and
–  disposing of office waste and used equipment in a responsible 
manner.
Involvement in the private equity sector
The Company’s principal corporate social responsibility objective is 
to support the role and impact of private equity. This is achieved by:
–  working with relevant sector associations;
–  participating in other relevant initiatives; and
–  engaging in discussions with stakeholders.
CSR principles affecting Candover’s portfolio companies
Candover backs management teams to run the businesses in 
which the Company invests. We do not intervene directly in their 
executive responsibilities but we do expect them to consider the 
social and environmental impacts of how the businesses operate.
We have adopted seven principles which we expect each 
management team to consider with us at least annually, and  
to use to stimulate ideas and action within their company. 
–   Invest and build: our aim is to create value, and creating value 
often requires investment. Our management teams will actively 
find ways to invest in the technology, facilities and people in their 
companies to make the businesses profitable and sustainable.
–  Respect the law: management teams will ensure they 
understand the laws and regulations that relate to their 
companies and that the companies are fully compliant.
–   Tackle waste: our management teams will understand how their 
businesses use resources and ensure that consumption and 
waste are controlled. In companies that use significant amounts 
of energy, it will be measured and managed.
–   Focus on the market: our businesses need healthy markets 
to grow and, in turn, healthy markets need healthy societies. 
Our management teams will look in depth at trends and social 
concerns relevant to their markets.
–   Focus on the positive: we believe in the power of business to 
solve problems, including social and environmental ones. Our 
management teams will be alert to opportunities to develop new 
products and services that benefit society and the environment.
–   Integrity: our management teams will run their companies 
honestly and fairly, ensuring that they – and those who work for 
them – are free from damaging conflicts of interest, corruption 
and nepotism.
–  Appropriate reporting: many of our businesses are relatively 
small and most are business to business operations. In larger 
businesses and in those operations which have a significant 
public face, our management teams will ensure that they report 
publicly on suitable non-financial topics following sector and 
industry norms.

Report and accounts 2009 41
The Directors’ remuneration report sets out (i) Candover’s 
remuneration policy; (ii) the remuneration of its executive and 
non-executive directors; and (iii) the activities of the Remuneration 
Committee for the year ended 31st December 2009. It has been 
prepared on behalf of the Board in accordance with the Companies 
Act 2006, Schedule 8 of the Large and Medium-sized Companies 
and Groups (Accounts and Reports) Regulations 2008 and the 
Combined Code. It will be put to shareholders for approval by 
ordinary resolution at the Annual General Meeting to be held on 
20th May 2010.
The audited sections of the Directors’ remuneration report have 
been clearly marked. 
Remuneration Committee
Composition and operation
The Remuneration Committee is responsible for setting a 
remuneration policy that reflects the Company’s strategic goals and 
incentivises its executives who have a significant role in ensuring 
that the Company meets its strategic objectives. 
During the year, the members of the Remuneration Committee  
were Richard Stone (Chairman), Gerry Grimstone, Antony Hichens, 
Chris Russell, Lord Jay, Nicholas Jones and Jan Oosterveld.  
The full Remuneration Committee, which meets as often as 
necessary to discharge its duties, met on three occasions  
in 2009. Attendances at Committee meetings is set out in the 
Corporate governance section on page 29. Terms of reference  
of the Committee are available on the Company’s website at  
www.candoverinvestments.com.
No member of the Remuneration Committee has any personal 
financial interests or conflicts of interest (other than as 
shareholders). In this regard, the Remuneration Committee gives  
full consideration to the provisions of the Combined Code.
Professional advice
During the year the Remuneration Committee received, at the 
Company’s expense, professional advice at a cost of £4,885 from 
Hewitt New Bridge Street (a trading name of Hewitt Associates), 
independent remuneration advisers, in relation to the design and 
implementation of a new long-term incentive plan. MM&K Limited, 
also independent remuneration advisers, provided advice at a cost 
of £4,000 on market comparison salary benchmarking to ensure 
that the Company’s remuneration policy remained in line with market 
trends and practice. Neither Hewitt New Bridge Street or MM&K 
provided any other services to the Company during the year.
Activities during the year
Given the challenges faced by the Company in 2009, the 
Remuneration Committee worked, in the interests of shareholders, 
to ensure that the Company’s remuneration policy reflected and 
supported the Company’s strategic goals throughout the year.
As the Company reduced its cost base, the Remuneration 
Committee assisted with the wholesale restructuring of the firm, 
setting severance policy and ensuring that it was consistently 
applied across the Group. 
With the Company’s decision to appoint an executive Director to 
join the wholly non-executive Board, the Remuneration Committee 
worked with Hewitt New Bridge Street to design a remuneration 
package to secure the services of Malcolm Fallen as CEO, thereby 
ensuring that his longer term financial interests are fully aligned with 
those of the shareholders of the Company. Details of Mr Fallen’s 
remuneration package are disclosed later in this report.
As described in the Chairman’s statement on page 2, 2009 
presented an opportunity for Candover to put in place succession 
plans within the Group. However, the greatest challenge for the 
Remuneration Committee was the retention of the new, smaller 
Candover Partners team as a cohesive, motivated unit, with their 
financial interests fully aligned with the interests of the Limited 
Partners and shareholders in order to maximise value from the 
portfolio companies. The Remuneration Committee worked with 
the Candover Partners team, led by John Arney, to ensure that the 
remuneration policy (i) provided some level of financial certainty 
for the executives of Candover Partners and (ii) aligned each team 
member with the portfolio companies they were now responsible for 
managing. This work involved putting in place deferred payments 
for the executives of Candover Partners that are conditional upon 
the executives remaining with the Company. These payments also 
have clawback provisions. The Remuneration Committee also 
reviewed the existing long-term incentive arrangements, including 
carried interest and co-investment arrangements, to optimise their 
value by carefully realigning the team’s interests with their portfolio 
responsibilities. These incentive arrangements are described more 
fully below.
The Remuneration Committee also agreed to the Chairman’s 
proposal to reduce his salary as from 1st January 2010 to  
£100,000 pa, reflecting the reduction in the size of the Company.
The Remuneration Committee reviewed salaries and performance 
related bonuses payable to Candover Group employees. Salary 
levels were reviewed after considering relative salary levels within the 
industry, the estimated movement in net assets and the profits for the 
year. Performance bonuses were reviewed after consideration of the 
profit and net asset performance, operational achievements of the 
Company, including progress on investments and realisations, and 
the external market. No discretionary bonuses have been or will be 
paid to investment executives of Candover Partners for the period 
to 31st December 2009. There were no wholesale salary increases 
across the Group, however, certain employees of Candover Partners 
received salary increases to reflect new roles and responsibilities. 
Remuneration policy:
The Group’s remuneration policy is designed to:
–  ensure that Candover maintains competitive remuneration 
packages in order to recruit, retain and motivate executives  
of exceptional quality in the overall interests of shareholders;
–  reward people equitably for the size of their responsibilities, 
performance and potential; and
–  align and recognise the individual’s contribution to the success 
of our business goals.

Directors’ remuneration report
continued
The option will normally become capable of exercise shortly 
following the date of announcement of the preliminary results of 
the Company for the financial year ending 31st December 2012 
(the “2012 Year”) and will remain exercisable up until the tenth 
anniversary of grant, subject to the satisfaction of the performance 
conditions and Mr Fallen being an employee or Director in the 
Company’s Group at that time. 
On exercise, the option will be satisfied using existing Shares 
purchased in the market. The option may also be satisfied in cash.
(i) Performance conditions
The option has been granted subject to a performance condition 
which is based on the average price of a Share during the ten 
dealing days immediately following the date of announcement of 
results for the 2012 Year, plus the aggregate cash value of dividends 
and other distributions paid on a Share (“Absolute Total Shareholder 
Return”) during the period from grant up to the tenth dealing day 
immediately following the announcement of results for the 2012 
Year (the “Performance Period”). The option will not become 
capable of exercise unless Absolute Total Shareholder Return is 
at least equal to £8. Thereafter the option will become capable of 
exercise, as follows:
Absolute Total Shareholder Return at   Percentage of the option 
the end of the Performance Period   that becomes exercisable
Equal to or greater than £12  100%
Between £8 and £12  On a straight line basis 
   between 20% and 100%
Equal to £8  20%
Less than £8  0%
For the purposes of calculating Absolute Total Shareholder Return, 
in addition to dividends paid during the Performance Period, the 
Remuneration Committee may, at its discretion, include the value 
of any other capital or income distribution associated with the 
proceeds of sale of portfolio investments during the Performance 
Period, which may include a share buyback, reduction of capital 
or the creation of a new class of share in the Company which is 
subsequently redeemed, repurchased or cancelled.
The Committee may vary the performance condition if an event has 
occurred which causes the Committee to consider that it would be 
appropriate to do so, provided the Committee considers that the 
varied condition is fair and reasonable and is neither materially more 
nor less challenging than the original condition would have been, 
but for the event in question.
(ii) Leaving employment
If Mr Fallen ceases employment for any reason (except summary 
dismissal), the option may be exercised early within the period of 
12 months of the date of cessation, subject to the satisfaction of 
the performance condition at that time. In this case, Absolute Total 
Shareholder Return will normally only be calculated by reference 
to the dividends and other distributions paid during the period 
from grant to the date of cessation of employment. However the 
Committee may, at its discretion, also include the average price  
of a Share for the ten dealing days immediately prior to cessation. 
If Mr Fallen is summarily dismissed, his option will lapse. 
In setting pay, the Remuneration Committee is sensitive to pay 
elsewhere in the Group, especially when determining salary 
increases. The Remuneration Committee has considered the 
structure of senior executive pay from a risk perspective. It is 
satisfied that the packages do not encourage inappropriate  
risk taking.
Summary of Mr Fallen’s remuneration package
The remuneration package for Mr Fallen comprises both fixed  
and variable elements, including salary, a performance related 
bonus, pension contributions and participation in a long-term 
incentive plan. 
A key consideration when determining Mr Fallen’s remuneration 
package was the Remuneration Committee’s desire for a  
significant proportion of the package to be performance related, 
with the incentive fully aligned to the Company’s primary objective 
of maximising shareholder return.
Base salary
Mr Fallen’s base salary takes account of the size of his role and his 
individual contribution. It was set fairly, within a competitive market 
range derived from a peer group of UK listed companies. The base 
salary will be reviewed annually (first review due 1st January 2011) 
after considering relative salary levels within the industry and the 
estimated movement in the Company’s net assets and the profits 
for the year. Mr Fallen’s annual base salary was set at £400,000 pa 
effective from 9th September 2009.
Discretionary performance related bonus
The annual performance related bonus is capped at 100% of  
salary and is awarded based upon achieving annually agreed 
performance objectives. 
Mr Fallen’s bonus potential was pro-rated down to reflect his time 
in the role in 2009. His performance objectives were set upon his 
recruitment and were in line with our strategic business objectives 
for 2009 and with shareholder interests. In respect of the financial 
year ended 31st December 2009, Malcolm Fallen received a bonus 
of £98,000 or 78% of his base salary.
Pension contributions
The Company operates a non-contributory group personal pension 
plan for the benefit of its employees, which executive Directors  
are eligible to join. Contributions are payable as a percentage of 
base salary. 
Long-term incentive award
On 9th September 2009, Mr Fallen was granted a nil cost option 
over 325,000 Shares in the Company. No payment was made for 
the grant of the option and no payment is required on exercise. 
The option was granted to Mr Fallen under Listing Rule 9.4.2R(2) 
specifically to facilitate his retention beyond his original six month 
term of employment and to secure Mr Fallen’s recruitment as the 
new Chief Executive Officer of the Company. A summary of the 
principal terms of the option are set out below. Section 1:

Candover 
Report and accounts 2009 43
(i) Carried interest
Carried interest is a beneficial interest in the limited partnerships 
comprising each of the Candover Funds. In order to align 
executives’ interests with those of third party investors in the 
Candover Funds, certain performance conditions are applied such 
that any gains achieved through the carried interest arrangements 
associated with the Candover Funds is conditional upon a certain 
minimum return being generated for investors. The attainment of 
this minimum return is subject to independent verification by KPMG 
LLP in their capacity as auditors to the Candover Funds. These 
carried interest gains are paid by Candover Funds out of profits 
made by those funds and are not a charge on the profits  
of Candover. 
(ii) Co-investment 
Under the co-investment arrangements in place, executives of 
Candover Partners are required to make an investment in the 
ordinary equity and loan capital of companies in which Candover, 
as well as the third party funds managed by Candover Partners, 
have made an investment. Employee benefit trusts (“EBTs”) were 
established as additional co-investment vehicles during 2001 
and 2005 as part of the arrangements constituting the Candover 
2001 and Candover 2005 Funds. The Company, on behalf of 
its employees, co-invests in portfolio companies alongside the 
Candover 2001 and Candover 2005 Funds managed by Candover 
Partners. As and when investments are realised by the Candover 
2001 and Candover 2005 Funds, the EBTs distribute realisation 
proceeds to the executives of Candover Partners who are 
beneficiaries of the EBTs.
Share matching plan
Candover operates a share matching plan (“SMP”) for the 
executives of Candover Partners Limited. The purpose of the 
SMP is to encourage executives to own shares in Candover 
Investments plc, promoting a better alignment of interests and a 
focus on Group performance. Demanding performance criteria, 
which require the Company’s net asset per share growth to 
outperform the FTSE All-Share Index by a fixed margin over a fixed 
three year period, attach to the receipt of any matching shares. 
Given the decline in reported net asset value per share over the 
three year period to 31st December 2009, none of the matching 
awards granted in 2007 will vest.
Share option plan
Candover also operates a company share option plan (“CSOP”) for 
its support staff who play an important role that adds to shareholder 
value, but who do not participate in incentive schemes linked 
to funds managed by Candover Partners. Options granted to 
staff in 2007 would not be exercised as the option price remains 
significantly higher than the current share price. Further details can 
be found in note 2 to the accounts on page 61.
The Company’s non-executive directors are not eligible to 
participate in the SMP or the CSOP , and no individual employee  
will be eligible for both schemes in any given year.
Mr Fallen did not participate in the SMP or the CSOP in 2009 and 
will not do so in 2010.
(iii) Corporate events
In the event of a takeover or winding up of the Company (not being 
an internal corporate reorganisation), the option shall vest to the 
extent (if at all) determined by the Committee at its discretion. 
In the event of an internal corporate reorganisation, the option 
will be replaced by an equivalent new option over shares in a new 
holding company, unless the Committee decides that the option 
should become exercisable on the basis which would apply in the 
case of a takeover.
(iv) Rights over Shares 
The option will not confer any shareholder rights until it has been 
exercised and Shares have been transferred to Mr Fallen. 
Mr Fallen will be entitled to receive a payment (in cash and/or 
shares) on or shortly following the exercise of his option of an 
amount equivalent to the dividends and, at the discretion of the 
Committee, the value of any other return of capital or income to 
shareholders that would have been paid on those Shares in  
respect of payment dates between the date of grant and the  
date when the option first becomes capable of exercise. 
(v) Variation of capital
In the event of any variation of the Company’s share capital, a 
demerger, payment of a special dividend or similar event which 
materially affects the market price of the Shares, the Committee 
may make such adjustment as it considers appropriate to the 
number of Shares subject to the option. 
(vi) Alterations to the plan
The Company may, at any time, amend the option agreement in any 
respect, provided that the prior approval of shareholders is obtained 
for any amendments that are to Mr Fallen’s advantage in respect of 
the basis for determining his entitlement to, and the terms of, the 
Shares or cash to be acquired and the adjustment of his option.
The requirement to obtain the prior approval of shareholders will 
not, however, apply to any minor alteration made to benefit the 
administration of the option agreement, to take account of a  
change in legislation or to obtain or maintain favourable tax, 
exchange control or regulatory treatment for Mr Fallen or for any 
company in the Group. 
(vii) General
The option is not transferable, except on death. The option is not 
pensionable.
Other long-term incentive arrangements
As is customary in the private equity industry, investors in third party 
funds managed by Candover Partners expect executives with 
responsibility for managing those funds to participate in incentive 
arrangements linked to those funds. These arrangements comprise 
carried interest and co-investment. Candover

Accounting policies
The principal accounting policies adopted in the preparation of 
these financial statements are set out below. These policies have 
been consistently applied to all the periods presented. There has 
been a change in accounting policy in the year in relation to the 
disclosure of the rolled-up loan note interest. Management has 
considered the disclosure of a third statement of financial position, 
and related notes within the financial statements as required by 
IAS 1 Revised. However, the change in accounting policy does not 
have a significant impact on the Group and Company statement of 
financial position and the reclassification has been disclosed within 
the notes to the financial statements, set out on pages 65 and 67.
Basis of preparation
The Group and Company have prepared their financial statements 
under International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted 
by the European Union (“IFRSs”). IFRSs comprise standards 
and interpretations approved by the International Accounting 
Standards Board (“IASB”) and the International Financial Reporting 
Interpretations Committee (“IFRIC”) as adopted in the European 
Union as at 31st December 2009.
The financial statements have been prepared on the historical  
cost basis of accounting, except for measurement at fair value of 
certain assets.
Going concern
Under the Combined Code and applicable regulations, the 
Directors are required to satisfy themselves that it is reasonable  
to presume that the Company is a going concern. 
The Group’s business activities, together with the factors likely to 
affect its future development, performance and position, are set out 
in the Chairman’s statement, the CEO’s report and the Manager’s 
portfolio review on pages 2 to 17. The financial position of the 
Group, its cash flows, liquidity position and borrowing facilities are 
described in the Financial review on pages 6 to 7. The Corporate 
governance section on pages 28 to 35 and the Risk review on 
pages 36 to 39 outline the Group’s financial and operational 
risks. In addition, note 25 to the financial statements on page 73 
includes the Group’s financial risk management objectives, its 
capital management policies and procedures, details of its financial 
instruments and hedging activities and its exposures to market risk, 
currency risk, interest rate risk, credit risk, liquidity risk and other 
price risk.
As described in the Chairman’s statement on page 2, the  
past year has seen an improvement in the Company’s financial 
stability. At the end of 2008, Candover reported a significant  
drop in net asset value and noted that the worsening economic 
conditions as well as volatile financial markets could lead to further 
declines in valuation. In 2009, the Company took steps to reduce 
headcount, preserve cash and implemented a programme of 
operational cost savings. 
The Directors consider that the steps taken in 2009 to enhance and 
improve the Company’s financial position, together with the benefit of 
asset realisations by Candover Partners Limited and an improvement 
in the external environment, have been materially beneficial.
As explained in the Chairman’s statement on page 2 and as 
summarised on page 23, the agreement reached to terminate  
the Candover 2008 Fund and the release of the Company from  
its commitment thereto has further enhanced the Company’s 
financial position. 
Candover has confirmed that it is in full compliance with the terms 
of the US private placement bonds issued in 2007. 
The Directors have a reasonable expectation that the Group and 
the Company have adequate resources to continue as a going 
concern for the foreseeable future, having made enquiries and after 
considering and taking into account the matters described above. 
For these reasons, they continue to adopt the going concern basis 
in preparing the Report and accounts.
The significant accounting policies are set out below:
Investment Trust SORP
Where presentational guidance set out in the Statement of 
Recommended Practice (“SORP”) for investment trusts, issued by 
the Association of Investment Companies (“AIC”) is consistent with 
the requirements of IFRSs, the Directors have sought to prepare  
the financial statements on a basis compliant with the SORP . 
 
Management expenses and finance costs 
Management expenses and finance costs have been allocated 
80% to capital and 20% to revenue.
Basis of consolidation
The consolidated financial statements incorporate the financial 
statements of the Company and entities controlled by the Company 
(its subsidiary undertakings) made up to the statement of financial 
position date. Control is achieved where the Company has the 
power to govern the financial and operating policies of an investee 
entity so as to obtain benefits directly from its activities.
Revenue
Income arises from investment management, fees relating to 
advisory work on investment transactions and interest income. 
Investment management fees are recognised under the accruals 
basis, other fees are recognised in full once a contractual obligation 
is created for the third party and the service provided. 
Interest income on financial investments, and cash and cash 
equivalents, is recognised in the statement of comprehensive 
income using the effective interest rate applicable. A provision will 
be made against this income where there is uncertainty as to its 
future recoverability. The requirement or otherwise for a provision is 
considered in conjunction with the valuation of the related financial 
investment, the approach to which is stated below.
Operating segments 
Candover has implemented IFRS 8 Operating Segments with effect 
from 1st January 2009. Candover’s operating segments are being 
reported based on the financial information provided to the Chief 
Executive Officer of Candover Investments Plc and to the Managing 
Partner of Candover Partners Limited.
The Group operates with two clearly defined segments. First is 
the co-investment activity of the Company which aims to provide 
its shareholders with quoted access to private equity returns. The 
second segment mainly comprises the investment management 
activities of Candover Partners. Candover 
Report and accounts 2009 50
Accounting policies 
continued
The Group Statement of Comprehensive Income is analysed into 
these segments, with the co-investment activity reported under 
‘capital’ and the other segment reported under ‘revenue’.
The Group’s material non-current assets are the portfolio companies 
of the co-investment segment. These are assessed geographically 
in the Manager’s portfolio review on page 8 to 17.
Placement fees
Pre-paid placement fees incurred in the establishment of managed 
funds are carried as current assets recoverable from future 
management fees receivable and are written off over the anticipated 
duration of the managed fund.
Share-based payments
The Group enters into arrangements that are equity-settled  
share-based payments with certain employees. These are 
measured at fair value at the date of grant, which is then recognised 
in the statement of comprehensive income on a straight-line basis 
over the vesting period, based on the estimate of shares that 
will eventually vest. The charge is adjusted at each statement of 
financial position date to reflect the actual number of forfeitures and 
leavers during the period. The movement in cumulative changes 
since the previous statement of financial position is recognised  
in the statement of comprehensive income, with a corresponding 
entry in equity. Cancellations are accounted for as an acceleration 
of vesting rather than by adjusting the number of equity  
instruments expected to vest. Fair value is measured by use  
of the Black-Scholes model. 
Property, plant and equipment
All property, plant and equipment is stated at historical cost  
less depreciation.
Depreciation is calculated to write down the cost less residual value 
of all property, plant and equipment by equal annual instalments 
over their expected useful lives. The periods generally applicable 
are plant and equipment two to five years and motor vehicles three 
years. Leasehold improvements are depreciated over the duration 
of the lease. The residual value of all assets is assessed annually.
Financial investments
The Directors consider that a substantial measure of the 
performance of the Group is assessed through the capital gains 
and losses arising from the investment activity of the Group. 
Consequently, for measurement purposes financial investments, 
including equity, loan and similar instruments, are designated at fair 
value through profit and loss and are valued in compliance with IAS 
39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement and the 
International Private Equity and Venture Capital Valuation Guidelines 
as recommended by the BVCA, the principles of which are set out 
on page 18.
Financial investments are recognised in the statement of financial 
position at fair value. Gains and losses on the realisation of financial 
investments are dealt with through the statement of comprehensive 
income and taken to the realised capital reserve. Financial 
investments are not held for immediate resale and any gains on 
realisations are not available for distribution as a dividend. The 
difference between the fair value of financial investments and cost 
to the Group is shown as an unrealised gain or loss in the statement 
of comprehensive income and taken to the unrealised capital reserve. 
Investments in subsidiary undertakings are reflected in the 
Company’s accounts at cost less impairment. 
 
There has been a change in accounting policy in the year in relation 
to the disclosure of the rolled-up loan note interest. As the value of 
rolled-up loan note interest recognised is based on the overall value 
of the investment, the Directors feel it more appropriate to disclose 
rolled-up loan note interest in the Group statement of financial 
position within financial investments designated at fair value through 
profit and loss rather than in trade and other receivables.
Receivables and payables
Receivables and payables are accounted for at fair value at initial 
recognition and thereafter at amortised cost using the effective 
interest rate method.
Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents include cash in hand, deposits held  
at call with banks, other short-dated listed fixed income securities  
and money market instruments. Such assets are held-for-trading, 
with capital gains, losses and fair value movements accounted  
for in the statement of comprehensive income, and taken to capital 
reserves due to the fact that such balances are held for future 
investment in financial investments.
Borrowings
Interest-bearing loans and overdrafts are initially recognised at 
the fair value of the liability, net of direct issue costs. After initial 
recognition, these are subsequently measured at amortised cost 
using the effective interest method, which is the rate that exactly 
discounts the estimated future cash flows through the expected life 
of the liabilities. Amortised cost is calculated by taking into account 
any issue costs and any discount or premium on settlement. 
Finance costs, including premiums payable on settlement or 
redemption and direct issue costs, are accounted for on an 
accruals basis to the statement of comprehensive income using 
the effective interest method. Movements in value for currency 
fluctuations are taken to unrealised capital reserves, net of the 
impact of any designated hedging arrangements. 
Derivative financial instruments
Derivative financial instruments are used by the Group to manage 
the risk associated with foreign currency fluctuations and changes 
in interest rates on its borrowings. This is achieved by the use of 
currency swaps and interest rate swaps. All derivative financial 
instruments are held at fair value. Where appropriate, derivative 
financial instruments are designated as fair value hedges on 
inception with the effectiveness tested both at this date and semi-
annually thereafter on a prospective and retrospective basis.
Derivative financial instruments are recognised initially at fair value 
on the contract date and subsequently remeasured to the fair 
value at each reporting date. The fair value of currency swaps and 
interest rate swaps is determined with reference to future cash 
flows and future interest and exchange rates. All changes in the fair 
value of financial instruments are accounted for in the statement 
of comprehensive income and taken to the unrealised capital 
reserve net of any designated hedging arrangements which are 
offset against the movements in the instrument being hedged. The 
ineffective portion of any fair value hedge is assessed semi-annually 
and taken to the Statement of comprehensive income. Section 1:

Report and accounts 2009 51
Financial assets and liabilities on equity commitments
Financial assets and liabilities on equity commitments are  
measured at fair value, which is determined by reference to 
the Group’s valuation of the underlying portfolio company, in 
accordance with the Group’s policy on financial investments.
Deferred tax
Deferred tax is recognised in full, using the liability method, on all 
temporary differences arising between the tax bases of assets and 
liabilities and their carrying amounts in the financial statements. 
Deferred tax is measured using rates of tax that have been enacted 
or substantively enacted by the statement of financial position date.
Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable 
that future taxable profits will be available against which the 
temporary differences can be utilised.
Due to the Company’s status as an investment trust, and the 
intention to continue meeting the conditions required to obtain 
approval in the foreseeable future, the Company has not provided 
for deferred tax on any capital gains and losses arising on the 
revaluation or disposal of investments.
Foreign currencies
Foreign currency transactions are translated into the functional 
currency using the exchange rates prevailing at the dates of the 
transactions. Foreign exchange gains and losses resulting from  
the settlement of such transactions and from the translation  
at period-end exchange rates of monetary assets and liabilities 
denominated in foreign currencies are recognised in the statement 
of comprehensive income. Where exchange differences result  
from the translation into Sterling of foreign currency resources 
that are held for future financial investments, the gain or loss is 
accounted for in the statement of comprehensive income and  
taken to capital reserves. 
The results and financial position of all the Group entities that 
have a functional currency different from the presentation 
currency are translated into the presentation currency as follows:
–  assets and liabilities for each statement of financial position 
presented are translated at the closing rate at the date of that 
statement of financial position;
–  income and expenses for each statement of comprehensive 
income are translated at actual exchange rates; and
–  all resulting exchange differences are recognised in other 
comprehensive income.
The cumulative exchange gains and losses on foreign currency net 
investments are accounted for in the statement of comprehensive 
income when these operations are disposed.
Pension costs
The Group contributes towards a number of funded defined 
contribution pension schemes designed to provide retirement 
benefits for its Directors and employees. The assets of the schemes 
are held separately from the Group in independently administered 
funds. The pension cost charge represents contributions payable 
by the Group to the schemes in respect of the accounting period.
Leases
Leases in which a significant portion of the risks and rewards of 
ownership are retained by the lessor are classified as operating 
leases. Payments made under operating leases (net of any 
incentives received from the lessor) are charged to the statement  
of comprehensive income on a straight-line basis over the period  
of the lease.
Dividends payable
Final dividends are accounted for when they are approved at  
the Annual General Meeting. Interim dividends are recognised  
when paid.
Critical accounting estimates and judgements
The preparation of financial statements requires the use of 
estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of 
assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the 
reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reported 
period. Although these estimates are based on management’s best 
knowledge of the amount, event or actions, actual results ultimately 
may differ from those estimates. 
The estimates and assumptions that have a significant risk of 
causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets 
and liabilities relate to:
–  the valuation of unlisted financial investments held at fair 
value through profit and loss, which are valued on the basis 
noted above (in the section headed Financial investments), 
the key areas of judgement being the adjustments required 
to normalise sustainable earnings and the appropriate 
comparable multiple to apply. The valuation policy is set out 
on page 18 and the Group’s exposure to valuation and market 
price risk is considered on page 73;
–  the recognition or otherwise of accrued income on loan notes 
and similar instruments granted to investee companies, 
which are assessed in conjunction with the overall valuation of 
unlisted financial investments as noted above;
–  the appropriateness of the allocation of management expenses 
between revenue and capital, which is based on the split of the 
long-term anticipated return between revenue and capital of 
net income;
–  finance costs have been allocated on the same basis as  
the above, whereas movements in the carrying value of 
borrowings and related instruments have been taken to the 
unrealised capital reserve as they have been raised to fund 
future financial investments;
–  the estimated future financial liability arising from future equity 
commitments and guarantees, which is assessed on the  
same basis as the valuation of unlisted financial investments  
as noted above; and
–  the recognition of the deferred tax asset, which is based on 
reasonable expectations on the timing of distributions to 
beneficiaries of the employee benefit trusts and the availability 
of future taxable profits. Candover

In preparing the Group financial statements for the  
current year, the Group has adopted the following new 
IFRS amendments to IFRS and IFRIC interpretations  
which have not had a significant impact on the results  
or net assets of the Group:
–  Amendments to IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and 
Measurement and IFRS 7 Financial Instruments: Disclosures, 
effective from 1st July 2008. These amendments permit the 
reclassification of financial assets in particular circumstances. 
The adoption of the amendments to IAS 39 and IFRS 7 has had 
no impact on the results or net assets of the Group.
–  IAS 1 Presentation of financial statements. This revised 
standard affects the presentation of changes in equity and  
the introduction of a Statement of Comprehensive Income.
–  IFRS 8 Operating Segments, effective for annual periods 
beginning on or after 1st January 2009. This new standard 
replaces IAS 14 Segment Reporting and requires segmental 
information to be presented on the same basis that 
management uses to evaluate performance of its reporting 
segments in its management reporting. Adoption of IFRS 8  
has had no significant impact upon the results or net assets  
of the Group.
Standards, amendments and interpretations effective,  
but do not have any impact on the Group:
–  Amendment to IAS 32 Financial Instruments: Presentation 
and IAS 1 Presentation of Financial Statements – Puttable 
Instruments and Instruments with Obligations Arising on 
Liquidation, effective for annual periods beginning on or after 
1st January 2009.
–  Amendments to IFRS 1 First-time Adoption of IFRSs and IAS 
27 Consolidated and Separate Financial Statements – Cost 
of an Investment of a Subsidiary, Jointly Controlled Entity or 
Associate, effective for annual reporting periods beginning on 
or after 1st January 2009.
–  Amendment to IFRS 2 Share-Based Payment – Vesting 
Conditions and Cancellations, effective for annual periods 
beginning on or after 1st January 2009.
–  IFRIC 13 Customer Loyalty Programmes, effective for annual 
periods beginning on or after 1st July 2008. This interpretation 
requires customer loyalty award credits to be accounted for 
as a separate component of the sales transaction in which 
they are granted and therefore part of the fair value of the 
consideration received is allocated to the award credits and 
deferred over the period that the award credits are fulfilled.
–  IFRIC 15 Agreements for the Construction of Real  
Estate, effective for annual periods beginning on or after  
1st January 2009.
–  IFRIC 16 Hedges of a Net Investment in a Foreign  
Operation, effective for annual periods beginning on or  
after 1st October 2008.
–  Amendment to IAS 23 Borrowing Costs, effective for annual 
periods beginning on or after 1st January 2009. The standard 
has been revised to require capitalisation of borrowing costs 
when such costs relate to a qualifying asset. We do not expect 
the adoption of the amendment to IAS 23 to have a significant 
impact upon the results or net assets of the Group.
–  IFRIC 14 The Limit on a Defined Benefit Asset, Minimum 
Funding Requirements and their Interaction, effective for annual 
periods beginning on or after 1st January 2009 as endorsed by 
the EU. This interpretation provides guidance on how to assess 
the limit on the amount of surplus in a defined benefit scheme 
that can be recognised as an asset under IAS 19 Employee 
Benefits. 
Standards, amendments and interpretations not yet 
effective, but not expected to have a significant impact  
on the Group:
–  Amendment to IAS 27 Consolidated and Separate Financial 
Statements, effective for annual periods beginning on or after 
1st July 2009.
–  Amendment to IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and 
Measurement – Eligible Hedged Items, effective for annual 
periods beginning on or after 1st July 2009.
–  Amendments to IFRS 3 Business Combinations, effective for 
business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or 
after the beginning of the first annual reporting period beginning 
on or after 1st July 2009.
–  IFRIC 17 Distributions of Non-Cash Assets to Owners, effective 
for annual periods beginning on or after 1st July 2009.
–  IFRIC 18 Transfers of Assets from Customers, effective  
for transfers of assets from customers received on or after  
1st July 2009. Section 1:

**  The classification of fair value gains and losses on derivatives was revised in 2008. Fair value gains and losses on derivative financial instruments which are taken out to mitigate 
the Group’s foreign currency exposure on its financial investments are now classified within “Gains on financial instruments at fair value through profit and loss” on the statement 
of comprehensive income. Previously, gains and losses on these derivative financial instruments were classified after “finance costs” on the statement of comprehensive 
income. The change, which has no impact on profit before tax, has been made in accordance with IAS 8 as, in the opinion of the Directors, it results in more relevant information 
about the effect of derivative transactions. Gains and losses on derivative financial instruments which have been taken out to mitigate the Group’s exposures on its loans and 
borrowings continue to be classified after “finance costs” on the statement of comprehensive income.
All of the profit for the year and the total comprehensive income for the year is attributable to the owners of the Company.
The supplementary revenue and capital columns are presented for information purposes as recommended by the Statement of Recommended Practice issued by the Association 
of Investment Companies.
 All items in the above statement derive from continuing operations. No operations were acquired or discontinued in the year.

Income arises from investment management and other financial services provided and fees relating to advisory work on investment 
transactions undertaken in relation to the activities of originating and investing in management buyouts and buyins. It also includes income 
derived from investments through the provision of capital to unquoted companies and interest on surplus cash.
The reversal of investment income in the prior year represented a provision against previously recognised income for uncertainty as to its 
future recoverability. The provision was considered in conjunction with the valuation of the related financial investment.
All income is attributable to continuing activities.

Exceptional costs
Exceptional costs are those items that are one off in nature and create significant volatility in reported earnings and are therefore reported 
separately in the statement of comprehensive income. These include non-recurring costs relating to the strategic review and restructuring 
costs that are not regular running costs of the underlying business.

As at 31st December 2009, the number of employees of the Group was 42 (2008: 100), of whom 19 were investment executives

During the year ended 31st December 2009, the Group had two share-based payment arrangements (2008: two), which are  
described below:
Company share option plan (“CSOP”)
The CSOP provides for grants of share options at an exercise price equal to the mid-market quoted market price for the Company’s Shares 
on the day before the date of grant. Options can be exercised three years after the grant. If the options remain unexercised after a period of  
10 years from the date of the grant, the options expire.
Share matching plan (“SMP”)
The SMP enables executives to invest in the ordinary share capital of the Company. The investment may be matched dependent  
upon the net asset value per share performance relative to the performance of the FTSE All-Share index over a three year period, up to  
a maximum of 3:1 matching shares (on a net to gross basis).

Note 4 Movements in the fair value of derivatives
The movement in the fair value of derivatives represents the ineffective element of the swaps held to mitigate the Group’s foreign currency 
exposure on its loans and borrowings amounting to a charge of £0.8 million (2008: a credit of £2.2 million). 
 
The fair value movement on the loans in the year was a £15.5 million loss (2008: a gain of £45.6 million), whilst the fair value movement on 
the hedging derivatives for the year was a £16.9 million loss (2008: a gain of £29.0 million)
Further information on currency and interest rate swaps is provided in note 16. Further information on Candover’s loans and borrowings 
related to these swaps is provided in note 15. 
Note 5 Taxation
The relationship between the expected tax charge based on the effective tax rate of 28% (2008: 28%) and the tax charge actually 
recognised in the statement of comprehensive income can be reconciled as below. As the Company is an investment trust, no tax is 
payable on capital gains made during the period; consequently the profit before tax used in the reconciliation below relates solely to the 
revenue column of the statement of comprehensive income.

Due to a change in accounting policy in the year, the rolled-up loan note interest has been reclassified in the Group statement of financial 
position from accrued income to financial investments designated at fair value through profit and loss which has the effect of increasing the 
financial investments balance for the year by £14.9 million (2008: £3.9 million; 2007: £19.5 million). Candover

At 31st December 2009, cumulative downwards adjustments amounting to £166.0 million (2008: £205.7 million) had been made against 
investments with original costs of £349.3 million (2008: £337.0 million).
During 2009, Candover Partners Limited purchased 100% of Bearstead Holding Sarl, which ultimately has 100% ownership of Bosting 
Holding Sarl. During the course of the year, Candover Partners Limited funded the repayment by Bosting Holdings Sarl of a financing facility 
used by that entity to warehouse an investment, funded by Candover Investments plc. Candover Partners Limited acts as a managing 
company and takes no economic risk or reward in relation to movements in the value of this investment. Its ultimate parent, Candover 
Investments plc, bears this responsibility and has provided Candover Partners Limited with a letter of support to that extent.

Interests in the Candover 1997, 2001, 2005 and 2008 Funds (other financial investments)
Candover Partners Limited is the General Partner of the limited partnerships comprising the Candover 1997 and 2001 Funds and is 
the manager of the Candover 2005 and 2008 Funds. In view of the excessive length, the name and address of each partnership will be 
enclosed with the Company’s next annual return as permitted under section 410 of the Companies Act 2006. 
The Company is a Special Limited Partner in the Candover 2001, 2005 and 2008 Funds and is a unit holder in the unauthorised unit trust 
that is a Special Limited Partner in the Candover 1997 Fund. In each case, the Special Limited Partner is entitled to participate in profits 
after a minimum rate of return has been achieved by the Limited Partners. This profit entitlement is referred to as the carried interest.
As at 31st December 2009 Candover’s investments as a Special Limited Partner in the 2001, 2005 and 2008 Funds were valued at  
£27.9 million, £0.3 million and £0.1 million respectively (2008: £19.2 million, £0.3 million and £0.1 million respectively). Candover’s 
investment in the unauthorised unit trust, which is a Special Limited Partner in the Candover 1997 Fund, was valued at £nil (2008: £nil).
Due to the effects of the global economic crisis, the Board reviewed the Group’s financial strategy and announced that it was not currently 
in a position to make any further investment in the Candover 2008 Fund. Since the year end, in agreement with the other investors in  
the Candover 2008 Fund, the Company has extinguished any ongoing commitment to the Candover 2008 Fund to ensure that it has the 
capital required to fund its commitment of £80.8 million for follow-on investments in the Candover 2005 Fund (callable until August 2011). Section 1:

Currency swaps 
The Group uses currency and interest rate swaps to minimise the effect of fluctuations in the value of the loans and borrowings from 
movement in foreign exchange and to swap fixed rate interest payments to floating rate payments. 
The fair value of these contracts is recorded in the statement of financial position and is determined by discounting future cash flows at the 
prevailing market rates at the statement of financial position date. Contracts designated as fair value hedges are offset against movements 
in the underlying loans and borrowings in the statement of comprehensive income.
At the statement of financial position date, the notional amount of outstanding derivative financial instrument contracts is as follows:
        2009 2008
        £m £m
Currency and interest rate swaps designated as fair value hedges     86.2 86.2
Other currency and interest rate swaps       116.2 116.2
The Group does not trade in derivatives. In general, derivatives are held to hedge specific exposures and have maturities designated to 
match the exposures they are hedging. It is the intention to hold both the financial instruments giving rise to the exposure and the derivative 
hedging them until maturity and therefore no net gain or loss is expected to be realised. 
The derivatives are held at fair value which represents the replacement costs of the instruments at the statement of financial position date. 
Movements in the fair value of derivatives are included in the statement of comprehensive income.
Note 16.1 Financial liability on equity commitments
The fair value of the Group future equity commitments and guarantees at the year end was £12.2 million (2008: £31.1 million). The fair value 
of the Company’s future equity commitments and guarantees at the year end was £20.4 million (2008: £31.1 million). Total cash value of 
future equity commitments and guarantees at the year end was £46.4 million (2008: £62.0 million). Candover

Note 25 Financial risk management
The Company and Group’s activities expose the Group to a variety of financial risks arising from its investment in equities and other 
instruments for the long-term so as to achieve its investment objectives. In pursuing its investment objectives, the Group is exposed to a 
variety of risks that could result in either a reduction in the Group’s net assets or a reduction of the profits available for dividends.
These risks include market risk (comprising valuation currency risk and interest rate risk), liquidity risk and credit risk. The Directors’ 
approach to the management of these risks is set out below. The Board of the Company oversees the Group’s risk management, which is 
embedded in the operating committees in the business, in conjunction with senior management.
The objectives, policies and processes for managing the risks and the methods used to measure the risks that are set out below have not 
changed from the previous accounting period other than the approach to currency risk, as described below. 
Note 25.1 Valuation/market price risk
The Group’s exposure to valuation risk mainly comprises of movements in the value of its investments. A breakdown of the Group’s 
portfolio is given on page 9 and a detailed analysis of the ten largest investments is given on pages 11 to 15. All underlying investments 
are valued at fair value by the Directors in accordance with the Group’s valuation policy set out on page 18. It should be noted that at 
31st December 2009, all (2008: 78%) of the Group’s underlying investments were valued on the multiple of earnings basis. Hence, future 
changes in comparable earnings multiples of publicly quoted companies, which we use to value our unquoted holdings, will impact the 
valuations of the portfolio companies, as would changes in the trading results of portfolio companies.
The table below, which captures the effect of the relative gearing of the underlying investments, summarises the effect that any fluctuation 
in market multiples would have on the valuation of the Group’s portfolio:
        Increase Decrease 
        £m £m
Fixed asset investments at fair value through profit and loss at 31st December 2009   319.9 319.9
10% changes in comparable multiples       72.7 (71.3)
Adjusted fair value of investments       392.6 248.6
Percentage of current fair value of investments      23% 22%
Percentage of net asset value       32% 31%
Valuation sensitivity
The Group’s sensitivity to valuation risk will be affected by changes in the Group’s levels of borrowing and liquidity. Any reduction in the 
value of the portfolio will be amplified by our statement of financial position gearing, which was 25% at 31st December 2009 (2008: 20%), 
the impact shown as a percentage of net assets. It will also be affected by the local currency denomination of such investments, which is 
considered separately under currency risk.
Management of the risk
The Group’s senior management assesses the exposure to market risk when making each investment decision and monitors the overall 
level of market risk on the whole of the investment portfolio on an ongoing basis. The Board monitors valuation risk by reviewing and 
approving the valuation of the portfolio.
During the first half of the year, the Company put in place option protection against any dramatic falls in stock markets and the underlying 
comparables. This option expired unexercised on 30th June 2009. Candover 
Report and accounts 2009 74
Notes to the financial statements 
for the year ended 31st December 2009

Concentration risk
The Group invests across a range of economic sectors and geographies. Over-exposure to a particular sector or geography could increase 
the impact of adverse changes in macro economic or market conditions on the Group. An increase in the average size of investments over 
time could also increase the exposure of the Group to the performance of a small number of large investments, albeit in different sectors 
and/or geographies. The portfolio is subject to periodic reviews by senior management in order to monitor exposure to any one sector 
or geography and to monitor the exposure to larger investments. One of the conditions set out under section 842 of the Income and 
Corporation Taxes Act 1988 is that, on acquisition, no single investment can exceed 15% of the Group’s investment portfolio to maintain 
the Group’s tax status as an investment trust. This also mitigates the Group’s exposure to investment concentration risk.
As at 31st December 2009, the ten largest investments represented 87.7% of the overall investment portfolio (2008: 85.4% on a like-
for-like basis), of which the underlying exposure to Expro International accounted for 29.9% of the investment portfolio (2008: 21.2%), or 
42.2% of net assets (2008: 31.8%).
Note 25.2 Liquidity risk
This is the risk that the Group will encounter difficulty in meeting obligations associated with uncalled commitments and financial liabilities. 
The Group invests from its own statement of financial position using cash generated from its investment activities. It is anticipated that 
over the longer term, and in normal circumstances, commitments would be financed by distributions received on the realisation of 
existing investments. However, over the second half of 2008, the effects of the global economic crisis meant not only a delay in expected 
realisations but a major decrease in net asset valuations caused primarily by continued falling public market comparable earnings multiples. 
As stated in note ten on page 66, as a consequence, the Group was not in a position to make any further investment in the Candover 2008 
Fund. Subsequent to the current year end, the Company has extinguished any ongoing commitment to the Candover 2008 Fund. 
The Group’s outstanding co-investment commitments and financial liabilities at 31st December 2009 were as follows:
Uncalled commitments
  Initial Outstanding
  commitment commitments
        2009 2008
       mm wm mm

*  As disclosed above and below, on 12th January 2010, the Company was released from its funding obligations under the co-investment agreement in respect of the  
Candover 2008 Fund. Therefore, the only outstanding commitment is to the Candover 2005 Fund. 
The cancellation of the Company’s commitments to the Candover 2008 Fund means it now has the following commitments

It should be noted that in addition to the movements in comparable multiples other significant factors, including covenant concerns and 
recent relevant market transactions, are taken into account in arriving at the valuations. Section 1:

Future equity commitments at the end of the year relate to equity bridges on investments alongside the Candover 2005 Fund as part of the 
overall outstanding commitment alongside that fund.
The Company also has a restriction for liquidity purposes from the loan-to-value covenant of its US private placement loan notes, where  
the ratio of net debt to adjusted investments should not exceed 40%. At year end, the ratio was 26.4% (2008: 33.6%), with a pro forma 
ratio of 22.7% adjusting for post year end realisations.
Note 25.3 Currency risk
Certain of the Group’s assets, liabilities, income and expenses are denominated in currencies other than Sterling (the Group’s functional 
currency and in which it reports its results), primarily with respect to the Euro and the US Dollar. Foreign exchange risk arises when future 
investment transactions and recognised assets and liabilities are denominated in currency that is not the entity’s functional currency. As  
a result, movements in exchange rates may affect the Sterling value of those items.
Management of the risk
Senior management monitors the Group’s exposure to foreign currencies and reports to the Board on a regular basis. Senior management 
measures the risk to the Group of the foreign currency exposure by considering the effect on the Group’s net asset value and income of a 
movement in the rates of exchange to which the Group’s assets, liabilities, income and expenses are exposed. 
Foreign currency borrowings and derivative financial instruments are used to limit the Group’s exposure to anticipated future changes 
in exchange rates which might otherwise adversely affect the value of the portfolio of investments. These borrowings and contracts are 
limited to currencies and amounts commensurate with the asset exposure to those currencies. 
As the majority of the Group’s future investment commitments are anticipated to be in Euro, US$175.0 million of the US Dollar loan notes 
raised under the US private placement has been converted to Euro liabilities through use of derivative financial instruments designated as 
effective fair value hedges. Likewise, the £30.0 million of funding received in January 2008 has been swapped into a Euro liability.
To reduce the foreign exchange risk arising from future investment transactions, cash and cash equivalents are split by currency according 
to the anticipated long-term requirements. The Group manages its currency exposure in order to mitigate any adverse impact on its loan-
to-value covenant through the denomination of its cash, debt and swaps rather than managing potential currency impacts on net asset 
values. As a result, currency fluctuations can have a material impact on net assets. Candover

Foreign currency sensitivity
The following table illustrates the sensitivity of the equity in regard to the Group’s monetary financial assets and financial liabilities and the 
exchange rates for Sterling/US Dollar and Sterling/Euro.
It assumes the following changes in exchange rates:
Sterling/US Dollar  +/- 10% (2008: 20%) 
Sterling/Euro  +/- 10% (2008: 20%)
The decrease in percentage used this year is to reflect the current market conditions that differ significantly compared to the year ending 
31st December 2008.
These percentages have been determined based on a reasonable estimate of the potential volatility. The sensitivity analysis is based on  
the Group’s monetary foreign currency financial instruments held at each statement of financial position date.
If Sterling had weakened/strengthened (amounts negative of those shown) against the currencies shown, this would have had the  
following effect:
  2009 (+/- 10%) 2008 (+/- 20%)
      US $ Euro US $ Euro

Loss attributable to equity shareholders (-10%/-20%)    (8.5) (13.7) (12.0) (27.0)
Note 25.4 Interest rate risk
Interest rate movements may affect:
– the fair value of the investments in fixed interest rate securities (including unquoted loans);
– the level of income receivable on cash and cash equivalents;
– the fair value of the Company’s loan notes issued under the US private placement (linked to fair value movement and derivatives);
– the interest payable on the Company’s variable rate borrowings; and 
– the fair value of the Company’s derivative financial instruments.
Management of the risk
The possible effects on fair value and cash flows that could arise as a result of changes in interest rates are taken into account when making 
investment and funding decisions.
The majority of the financial investments that are interest-bearing bear fixed interest; as a result, the Group is not subject to significant 
amounts of cash flow interest rate risk due to fluctuations in the prevailing levels of market interest rates. 
Any excess cash and cash equivalents are invested at short-term market interest rates, further reducing such risks. The loan notes raised 
through the US private placement were partly raised at fixed interest rates; these have substantially been swapped to floating rates set on  
a periodic basis at the prevailing market rate plus margin.
Interest rate exposure
The exposure for the Group and Company, at 31st December, of financial assets and financial liabilities to interest rate risk is shown  
by reference to:
– floating interest rates (i.e. giving cash flow interest rate risk) when the interest rate is due to be re-set; and
– fixed interest rates (i.e. giving fair value interest rate risk) when the financial instrument is due for repayment.

(2008: no change);
–  Interest paid on borrowings under the multi-currency loan facility is at a margin over LIBOR or its foreign currency equivalent for the type 
of loan of 0.85% (2008: 0.85%); 
–  Interest paid on borrowings on the US private placement loan notes is partly fixed and partly floating rate (US$200.0 million at 7.02%, 
m30.0 million EURIBOR plus 1.40% and £30.0 million at 7.45%). The fixed rate exposures have mainly been swapped into floating rate 
exposures through the use of the derivative financial instruments, with a subsequent weighted average margin over EURIBOR of 1.40% 
to 1.44%.

Interest rate sensitivity
As the Group’s loan note investments are held at fair value through profit or loss and valued in conjunction with the equity investment in the 
portfolio company (see valuation policy on page 18) these are not subject to changes in value arising from interest rate movements.
As cash and cash equivalents are invested at short-term market rates, for fixed short-term periods and held to maturity, they are not 
significantly impacted in respect of fair value by movements in interest rates. As certain of the borrowings under the US private placement 
loan notes are held at amortised cost, the movement in interest rates does not impact upon their carrying value.
A 50 bps movement in interest rates would impact upon the combined valuation of the derivatives and related hedged US private 
placement loan notes by: +50bps, a decrease in profit of £1.0 million (2008: £1.0 million); and -50bps, an increase in profit of  
£1.0 million (2008: £1.0 million).
Note 25.5 Credit risk
The Group’s exposure to credit risk principally arises from its investment in short-dated listed fixed income securities, money market 
instruments and its cash deposits.
Management of the risk
This risk is managed as follows:
–  where an investment is made in an unquoted loan to a private equity investment, it is made as part of the overall equity and debt 
investment package and the recoverability of the debt is assessed as part of the overall investment process;
–  transactions involving derivatives are entered into only with investment banks, the credit rating of which is taken into account so as to 
minimise the risk to the Group of default;
– exposure to individual financial institutions is minimised by the Group spreading its cash across a number of liquidity funds and banks;
–  cash equivalents consist of short-dated listed fixed income securities and money market instruments, with a credit rating of AA-  
or above; and 
– cash at bank is held only with major UK banks with high quality external credit ratings or government support.
Credit risk exposure
In summary, compared to the amounts included in the statement of financial position, the maximum exposure to credit risk at

Categorisation within the hierarchy has been determined on the basis of the lowest level input that is significant fair value measurement of the 
relevant asset as follows:
Level 1 – valued using quoted prices in active markets for identical assets.
Level 2 – valued by reference to valuation techniques using observable inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1.
Level 3 – valued by reference to valuation techniques using inputs that are not based on observable market data.
The valuation policy is explained on page 18.

Note 25.7 Capital management and policies and procedures
The Group’s capital management objectives are:
– to ensure that it will be able to continue as a going concern; and 
– to maximise the income and capital return to its equity shareholders.
This is achieved through an appropriate balance of equity capital and ‘debt’. The policy is that ‘debt’ as shown below should not lead to 
gearing exceeding 20% of the net assets over the investment cycle, albeit this has been impacted by the events of the past few years.
The Group’s capital at 31st December comprises:

Notes to the financial statements 
for the year ended 31st December 2009
continued
The Board, with the assistance of senior management, monitors and reviews the broad structure of the Group’s capital on an ongoing basis. 
This review includes:
–  the planned level of gearing, which takes account of senior management’s views on the market;
–  the need to buy back equity shares, either for cancellation or to hold in treasury, which takes account of the difference between the net 
asset value per share and the share price (i.e. the level of share price discount or premium);
–  the need for new issues of equity shares, including issues from treasury; and
–  the extent to which revenue, in excess of that which is required to be distributed, should be retained.
The Group’s objectives, policies and processes for managing capital are unchanged from the preceding accounting period.
The Company is subject to several externally imposed capital requirements:
–  the terms of issue of the US private placing of loan notes and multi-currency revolving facility require the Group’s level of borrowings  
net of cash and cash equivalents not to exceed 40% of investments at fair value through profit or loss (subject to certain restrictions);
–  as a public company, the Company has to have a minimum share capital of £50,000;
–  in order to be able to pay dividends out of profits available for distribution by way of dividends, the Company has to be able to meet  
one of the two capital restriction tests imposed on investment companies by company law; and
–  to retain its status as an investment trust, the Company is required to comply with the regulations of section 842 of the Income and 
Corporation Taxes Act 1988.
These requirements are unchanged since last year and the Group and the Company have complied with them.
Note 26 Related party transactions
The Company’s interest in the Candover 1997, 2001, 2005 and 2008 Funds is disclosed in note 10 on page 66, and in note 19 on page 71.
The Company’s subsidiary undertakings are listed in note 11 on page 67, which includes a description of the nature of their business. 
During the course of the year, the Company undertook transactions with Candover Services Limited which provided investment and 
administration services to the Company for which the Company was charged £4.6 million (2008: £13.4 million). 
Note 27 Contingent liabilities
During the course of 2008, the Company had guaranteed a m4.8 million facility made available to Northern Trust Fiduciary Services 
(Guernsey) Limited as trustee of the Candover 2005 Offshore Employee Benefit Trust and the Candover 2005 Onshore Employee  
Benefit Trust. For 2009, this guarantee remains at m4.8 million. Other than in the normal course of business, there were no other contingent 
liabilities at 31st December 2009 (2008: nil).
Note 28 Subsequent events
On the 8th January 2010, the Company and Candover Partners Limited announced that an agreement had been reached with investors  
in the Candover 2008 Fund to terminate the investment period of that fund. The principal terms of the agreement are set out in the Report  
of the Directors on page 23.
Also subsequent to the year end, the sale of Springer Science+Business Media was completed in February 2010, generating proceeds of 
£14.7 million for Candover (£3.2 million for the Company from its direct investment), which included carried interest distributions relating to 
the Candover 2001 Fund. The Candover 2001 Fund achieved a return of £27.7 million on this transaction before payment of carried interest. 
It should be noted that the year end valuation of Springer Science+Business Media reflects the proceeds value. Candover

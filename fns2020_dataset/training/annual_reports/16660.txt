Cookson Group plc  
Annual Report for the year ended 31 December 2011
BUSINESS MODEL AND STRATEGY
Cookson is a leading materials science company comprised of two 
main divisions — Engineered Ceramics and Performance Materials. 
We supply specialist consumable materials and chemicals used in 
industrial production processes — notably for the steel, foundry 
castings, electronics and electro-plating industries, and emerging 
“clean technology” sectors such as solar and LED.
Both divisions’ products and services add value to our customers’ 
businesses by enabling them to increase the efficiency and quality of 
their operations and products, reducing overall production costs, saving 
energy and reducing their environmental impact. Our products 
constitute a small fraction of our customers’ costs and add significant 
value to our customers.
In both cases, the business model is based on being recognised by our 
customers worldwide for technology leadership, outstanding technical 
support services and reliable “just in time” supply capabilities. This 
requires us to have manufacturing and technical support resources close 
to customers in every major economic region, supported by strong 
central R&D resources.  
Group-wide, including the smaller Precious Metals Processing division, 
we currently employ some 15,500 people working in more than 40 
countries. Approximately 23% of Group sales are to customers in NAFTA, 
35% in Europe, 32% in Asia-Pacific and 10% in the rest of the world, which 
is principally Brazil and South Africa.
We have focused our businesses on products and services where we can 
command leading global market positions and where we can sell on the 
basis of added value rather than just price. This has resulted in a progressive 
improvement in the Group’s profitability and returns to shareholders.
The Group is committed to maintaining a strong financial position to 
support its businesses, with low leverage and ample liquidity headroom 
under long-term financing arrangements. Strong emphasis is placed on 
risk management and a robust internal control framework has been 
developed to maintain a high level of governance.
In setting these targets we are not assuming any significant acquisitions, but some selected bolt-on acquisitions may continue to be made.  The 
significant improvement in the Group’s portfolio of businesses means that achievement of the 12% margin target does not require any division to deliver 
higher margins than they have previously achieved (note: pro forma for Foseco acquired in April 2008). 
We see achievement of these targets being underpinned by:
	 ❯ leading global market positions, supplying consumables to essential industries — steel, foundry and electronics;
	 ❯ track record of market share gains with new, enhanced technology, higher margin products — increased R&D capability and spending;
	 ❯ significant developing market exposure (c.50% of revenue; c.60% of trading profit);
	 ❯ considerable further recovery potential in mature markets where cost base significantly reduced; 
	 ❯ opportunities to leverage further organic growth through bolt-on acquisitions; and
	 ❯ maintaining strong cash flow momentum.

Cookson Group plc  
Annual Report for the year ended 31 December 2011
CHAIRMAN’S STATEMENT
JEFF HARRIS
RESULTS
This is my second report to shareholders and 
over the past year I have spent more time 
visiting Cookson’s operations and meeting 
with management and employees. I continue 
to be impressed by the underlying strength of 
our businesses, and by the commitment both 
to improving productivity and new product 
innovation so as to add value to our customers. 
Both the Engineered Ceramics division and the 
Performance Materials division have strong 
global market positions, competitive cost bases, 
and see profitable growth as a result of their 
continued investment in product innovation.  
We have renamed the divisions to better reflect 
the true nature of their activities. 
Cookson’ s results for 2011 clearly reflect the benefits 
of all these strengths, and show that we are making 
very encouraging progress on the three year 
targets we set out at the start of 2011.  Revenue 
grew by 11% to £2,826m, headline profit before 
tax increased by 18% to £261m, and headline 
earnings per share increased by 14% to 70.4 pence. 
Our financial position is strong with ample liquidity 
under our long-term financing arrangements.
Earlier in the year, when growth in some 
international markets looked uncertain, we 
made contingency plans for any further global 
economic downturn. This has not occurred and 
the outlook today is significantly more positive. 
DIVIDEND
Given the good trading performance in 2011 and 
the outlook for 2012, the Board is recommending a 
final dividend of 14.50p per share (2010: 11.50p), an 
increase of 26% and in line with our stated target of 
growing dividends ahead of earnings growth. 
T ogether with the interim dividend of 7.25p per 
share, this gives a total dividend for the year of 
21.75p per share (2010: 11.50p), an increase of 89%.
BOARD CHANGES
Dr Emma FitzGerald joined the Board as a 
non-executive Director on 1 August 2011.  
Dr FitzGerald is Vice President, Global Retail 
Network for Shell International and has 
extensive experience of the Asia-Pacific region 
having served on boards in Korea and China. 
We recently announced that Steven Corbett, 
President and Chief Executive Officer of Cookson’s 
Performance Materials division, will join the Board 
with effect from 1 May 2012. Mr Corbett joined 
Cookson’s Electronics division in 1990 and was 
promoted to his current role in 2004.
As reported in my last Chairman’s Statement, 
Barry Perry retired from the Board at the close of 
the Annual General Meeting on 12 May 2011. 
He had served with distinction as a Non-
executive Director since 2002.
GOVERNANCE
Good governance continues to be an essential 
element in the conduct of the Group’s affairs. The 
Board acknowledges, as a prime responsibility, its 
oversight of the Group’s strategy and 
performance. We believe that good governance, 
as evidenced by an effective Board, rigorous 
performance management, strong controls and 
risk appraisal and a culture of integrity, will best 
deliver long-term shareholder value.
DIVERSITY
Cookson looks at diversity in its broadest sense, as 
we feel it is important to get the right balance of 
independence, skills, knowledge and experience, 
both on the Board and across our business.
Ours is a global business employing over 15,000 
people in more than 40 countries; our 
management grades alone comprise over 40 
nationalities. Diversity is therefore an integral 
part of how we do business. We acknowledge its 
importance and recognise the benefits that 
different perspectives can bring. In recruiting 
our employees we draw on a varied range of 
backgrounds and expertise, benefitting from all 
dimensions of diversity including cultural and 
gender diversity. 
We support the broad thrust of the Davies 
report. We are pleased to have Dr Emma 
FitzGerald join our Board. In 2011 we also 
appointed our first female Divisional Chief 
Executive Officer. We aspire to increase such 
representation in the future.
Our Board appointments have been and will 
continue to be made on merit against objective 
criteria, selecting the best candidate for the post.  
Cookson will only use executive search firms that 
have adopted the Voluntary Code of Conduct 
addressing gender diversity and best practice.
PEOPLE
Our employees are key to the Group’s success.  
Their commitment and dedication is critical in 
achieving our goals and I pay tribute to them.  
The significant improvement in the Group’s 
performance is a credit to the hard work of 
Cookson employees around the globe.

CHIEF EXECUTIVE’S STATEMENT
NICK SALMON
OVERVIEW
The Group’s performance continued to improve 
significantly in 2011. Continued market 
penetration of newly-developed products 
and the further expansion of our presence 
in developing markets have positioned our 
businesses favourably to benefit from the 
growth in our main end-markets. Accordingly, 
we have recorded strong progress towards 
achievement of the three year performance 
targets we announced in January 2011.
We announced on 23 February 2012 an 
agreement to sell the US Precious Metals 
Processing business which will result in us 
exiting this loss-making business on a cash 
neutral basis.
The challenging global macro-economic trends 
evident through the second half of 2011 had 
only limited impact on our businesses. As 
anticipated, we saw some softening in steel 
production trends in Europe and China in the 
fourth quarter, but momentum in our foundry 
and electronics end-markets was maintained 
through to year-end. For 2012, we anticipate 
mid-single digit growth globally in our main 
end-markets with generally weaker demand in 
Europe being offset by continued growth in the 
Americas and Asia-Pacific.
RENAMING OF THE DIVISIONS AND THEIR 
BUSINESSES
Over the last ten years there have been 
substantial changes in the Group’s portfolio 
and business model. Two of the four main 
businesses within the Electronics division, which 
together represented roughly half the division’s 
revenue in 2003, were sold by 2006. By 2007, 
another twelve smaller non-core businesses 
across the Group had been sold or closed and, 
in early 2008, we completed the major Foseco 
acquisition which was integrated within the 
Ceramics division. Our business model has 
evolved, placing much more emphasis on new 
product development and higher added-value 
products and services targeted to lift margins, 
gain market share and enter new end-market 
segments. As a consequence we have now 
decided to rename the Group’s three divisions 
and the businesses within each division to 
better reflect the value-added nature of their 
operations and the end-markets they serve:

Cookson Group plc  
Annual Report for the year ended 31 December 2011
TRADING PERFORMANCE
Group revenue of £2,826m was 11% higher, 
as reported, than 2010 in part reflecting the 
pass through to customers of significantly 
higher commodity metals prices for tin, silver 
and gold. On an underlying basis (at constant 
exchange rates and commodity metals prices), 
Group revenue increased by 9%, reflecting 
some market share gains and our favourable 
geographic market coverage, with almost 
half of revenue coming from higher growth 
developing countries. Trading profit of £290.2m 
was 15% higher than that reported for 2010, 
with around 60% coming from higher growth 
developing countries. Return on sales margin 
improved to 10.3% (2010: 9.9%). If commodity 
metals prices had remained at average 2010 
levels, the margin in 2011 would have been 
10.9%. 
The Engineered Ceramics division’s revenue of 
£1,686m was 13% higher than that reported 
in 2010 and 12% higher on an underlying 
basis. Within this, the steel production industry 
related businesses of Steel Flow Control and 
Advanced Refractories had revenue of £533m 
and £545m respectively, underlying increases 
of 8% and 11%, which compare favourably with 
growth in global steel production, as reported 
by the World Steel Association, of 6.8%. The 
Foundry Technologies business had revenue of 
£527m, nearly back to the levels recorded in the 
first half of 2008 prior to the start of the financial 
crisis, an underlying increase of 19%. For all 
three of these businesses, raw material costs 
rose significantly during the year, particularly 
graphite, zirconia and magnesite minerals. 
Whilst compensating selling price increases 
were agreed with customers during the course 
of the year, there was some time lag in their 
implementation which had a negative impact 
on margins. Revenue for the smaller Fused Silica 
business of £81m was 6% higher than 2010 for 
the year as a whole, having been 34% ahead at 
the half year, reflecting the previously reported 
sharp fall in demand for Solar Crucibles™ driven 
by excess global inventories of solar panels. 
Decisive steps have been taken to adapt to 
these conditions. In total, the division’s trading 
profit of £193.2m was 9% higher than the 
prior year and the return on sales margin was 
11.5% (2010: 11.9%). Excluding the Fused Silica 
business, the return on sales margin for the 
remaining Engineered Ceramics division was 
11.6% compared to 11.3% in 2010. 
The Performance Materials division’s revenue of 
£814m was 13% higher than 2010, as reported. 
In large part, this increase was due to the pass 
through of higher tin, silver and gold prices. 
On an underlying basis, revenue increased as 
expected by only 1%, reflecting the ongoing 
strategy of exiting more commoditised 
products (such as some types of lower margin 
bar solder), partly offset by continued market 
penetration of innovative, higher value-added 
and higher margin, products. As a result of 
this mix change, the division’s trading profit 
increased significantly to £99.6m, an increase of 
40% over that reported in 2010. The return on 
sales margin rose to 12.2% (2010: 9.8%). The net 
sales value for the division, being revenue less 
the value of tin and precious metals included in 
revenue, was £418m (2010: £410m), an increase 
of 2% and the return on net sales value was 
23.8% (2010: 17.3%).
The Precious Metals Processing division’s net 
sales value (being revenue excluding the 
precious metals content) of £132m decreased 
by 1%, as reported. The European business 
performed well throughout the year, benefiting 
from high levels of reclaimed precious metal 
processing and refining activity. As previously 
reported, having operated around break-even in 
the first half, the US business incurred significant 
losses through the second half. As a result the 
division’s overall trading profit in 2011 of £6.2m 
was £6.5m lower than in 2010. In November 
2011, we announced that we had initiated a 
strategic review and significant downsizing of 
the US operations. Subsequently we entered 
into negotiations with Richline Group, Inc. (a 
subsidiary of Berkshire Hathaway Inc.) for it to 
acquire these US operations and on 22 February 
the parties signed a binding Sale and Purchase 
agreement, which is subject only to normal 
legal and regulatory closing provisions which 
we anticipate to be completed in the second 
quarter of 2012. The net cash consideration is 
subject to closing balance sheet adjustments, 
but is expected to be sufficient for the exit from 
the loss-making US business to be cash neutral, 
including the restructuring and other costs 
incurred in preparing the business for sale. The 
division’s profitable European operations are 
unaffected by the transaction.

EXCEPTIONAL ITEMS
A net charge, pre-tax, of £49.9m was incurred 
(2010: £32.7m), principally due to charges 
relating to amortisation of intangible assets 
(£17.8m), restructuring charges (£8.9m), finance 
costs (£1.9m), and loss on the disposal of 
businesses (£36.5m, of which £29.0m related to 
the US Precious Metals Processing business that 
was in the process of being disposed of at 
year-end). These charges have been partially 
offset by gains relating to employee benefits 
plans of £15.2m. Of the total net charge, £15m is 
cash-related and £35m is non-cash related. 
TAXATION
The tax charge on ordinary activities was 
£61.4m on headline profit before tax of 
£261.5m, an effective tax rate (before share of 
post-tax profit from joint ventures) of 23.5%. The 
effective tax rate in 2010 was 21.1%, as this 
reflected the benefit of a number of non-
recurring credits. The underlying effective tax 
rate for 2010 was around 24%. It is currently 
expected that the effective tax rate for 2012 will 
remain around 23.5%.
ATTRIBUTABLE PROFIT AND EARNINGS
Headline attributable profit was £194.2m (2010: 
£169.8m), an increase of 14%. Headline earnings 
per share was 70.4p (2010: 61.5p), also an 
increase of 14%.
After taking into account all exceptional items, 
the Group recorded a profit for the year of 
£146.8m compared with £145.3m for 2010.
PENSIONS
At 31 December 2011, the net deficit in the 
Group’s post-retirement defined benefits plans 
was £58.7m (31 December 2010: £113.8m). The 
significant improvement principally arose in 
respect of the Group’s UK pension plan. This 
reflected both strong gains for the plan assets 
arising from our investment and hedging 
strategies plus a gain in connection with the 
change in the UK inflation index (from RPI to 
CPI), more than offsetting the negative impact 
of lower discount rates used to value plan 
liabilities.
An enhanced transfer value exercise is currently 
ongoing in the UK and, as at 31 December 2011, 
a significant number of deferred members with 
liabilities totalling £37m had so far transferred 
out of the UK Plan. 
FINANCIAL POSITION
Net debt at 31 December 2011 was £364m, 
£34m higher than a year earlier. 
Trade working capital cash outflows were £61m 
in the year while reported revenue grew by 
£280m. Hence, the working capital to sales ratio 
increased to 23.1% (2010: 21.1%). Management 
action plans are in place targeted at improving 
working capital performance and we anticipate 
stronger cash generation in 2012. 
Capital expenditure of £85.1m (2010: £57.2m) 
was 1.5 times depreciation and included 
investments to expand our production capacity 
in higher growth markets, notably Brazil, India, 
China and Eastern Europe and in expanding and 
upgrading our R&D facilities. The net debt also 
reflects the acquisition of SERT for €11m (£9m) 
in November 2011.
In April 2011, the Group entered into a new 
£600m, five year revolving credit facility with a 
syndicate of banks to replace the existing 
£511m bank facility which was due to mature in 
October 2012. This followed the successful issue 
in December 2010 of US$250m of private 
placement loan notes with an average maturity 
of 8.7 years.
At 31 December 2011, the ratio of net debt to 
EBITDA was 1.1 times, very comfortably within 
the debt covenant level of 3.25 times, and the 
interest cover ratio was 15.1 times. The Group’s 
financial position is strong with ample liquidity 
under long-term financing arrangements.
OUTLOOK FOR 2012
While the macro-economic outlook remains 
uncertain, feedback from our customers and 
third party industry forecasters continues to 
indicate mid-single digit growth globally in our 
main end-markets in 2012, with generally 
weaker demand in Europe offset by continued 
growth in the Americas and Asia-Pacific. For the 
small Solar Crucibles™ business, we hope to see 
some recovery in the market in the second half 
of 2012, but are currently uncertain on the 
timing and rate of that recovery.
Both our Engineered Ceramics and Performance 
Materials divisions are well positioned to deliver 
further performance improvement based on 
their global market coverage, strong presence 
in higher growth developing markets, leading 
technologies and strong new product pipelines, 
high technical service element and value selling 
competence. The Board is confident of the 
Group’s ability to achieve further progress in the 
current year towards its 2013 targets, driving 
further value for shareholders.  20769-04  13/01/2012 Skeleton 2

Cookson Group plc  
Annual Report for the year ended 31 December 2011
CORPORATE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY  
BACKGROUND
Cookson employs some 15,500 people with manufacturing facilities in 
over 40 countries serving customers in more than 100 countries 
worldwide. We supply our customers with consumable products which 
they use in their manufacturing processes, for example in the production 
of steel, foundry castings, electronics and jewellery products. We operate 
in “just in time” supply chains with short lead times from order to delivery. 
We therefore have a relatively large number of small and medium sized 
facilities located close to our customers throughout the world’s major 
economic regions, rather than large centralised factories supplying 
customers worldwide. Our manufacturing processes are not energy 
intensive (total energy costs are approximately 2% of revenue) and do not 
produce large quantities of hazardous or other wastes and emissions.
SUSTAINABILITY
Cookson’s products and services can significantly reduce the 
environmental impact of our customers’ operations. We believe that by 
continuing to develop innovative products and services we can create 
leading market positions in profitable businesses which promote 
sustainability. We therefore maintain R&D spending at a high level and 
monitor this as a Group level KPI.
For example, the products of the Steel Flow Control, Advanced Refractories 
and Foundry Technologies product lines of our Engineered Ceramics 
division reduce the levels of energy usage and material wastage in the 
production of steel and foundry castings, markets where we are the 
world’s leading supplier of consumable ceramics used to handle molten 
metal. Similarly, our Performance Materials division is a market leader in 
the supply of lead-free and halogen-free materials used in the production 
of electronic equipment.
In the renewable energy field, the Engineered Ceramics division is the 
leading supplier of crucibles used in the production of multi-crystalline 
photovoltaic wafers used to make solar cells and the Performance 
Materials division has introduced new products for improved solar cell 
connectivity.
In recent years we have developed significant metal recycling operations 
in both our Precious Metals Processing and Performance Materials 
divisions. Here we recover and refine our own and customers’ scrap solder 
and precious metals/jewellery products to produce high purity silver, gold, 
tin and lead products which can be reintroduced into the supply chain. 
This has involved building new recycling facilities in the US and China and 
expanding recycling capacity in Europe. There is an increasing focus on the 
traceability of these metals to ensure they are obtained from 
environmentally and ethically sound sources, for example the “Green Gold” 
and “Conflict Metals” programmes. We work closely with our customers 
and suppliers in support of these initiatives.
POLICY
Cookson recognises that its operations impact a wide community of 
stakeholders, including investors, employees, customers, business 
associates and local communities, and that appropriate attention to the 
fulfilment of its corporate responsibilities can enhance overall 
performance. In structuring its approach to the various aspects of 
corporate social responsibility, the Company takes account of guidelines 
and statements issued by stakeholder representatives and other 
regulatory bodies from around the world. Social, environmental and 
ethical matters are reviewed by the Board, including the impact such 
matters may have on the Group’s management of risk.
Particular emphasis is focused on the following areas:
	 ❯ Code of Conduct: requiring all Cookson’s businesses and employees 
to comply with the highest standards of legal and ethical behaviour.
	 ❯ Health, Safety and Environment: protecting the health and safety of 
our employees, contractors, customers and the general public and 
reducing energy consumption and waste in our operations.
	 ❯ Products and Services: developing innovative products and services 
which promote sustainability in our customers’ production processes 
and products.
CODE OF CONDUCT
The Company has a Code of Conduct (“the Cookson Code”), which has 
been distributed throughout the Group in over 25 languages and by 
which all our businesses are required to operate. The Cookson Code 
emphasises the Company’s commitment to compliance with the highest 
standards of legal and ethical behaviour. The Cookson Code is reproduced 
in full on the Company’s website — www.cooksongroup.co.uk.
The Cookson Code sets out clear and simple principles covering: 
Customers, Products and Services; Employees; Investors; Society and Local 
Communities; Health, Safety and the Environment; Conflicts of Interest; 
and Competitors.
Long-term customer satisfaction is recognised as being essential to the 
attainment of Group goals, as is maintaining a reputation for integrity in all 
business and other dealings both with customers and suppliers. The 
Cookson Code defines how we must compete vigorously and honestly.
The Group believes it can only achieve its goals through the efforts of its 
employees. Job satisfaction requires working environments that motivate 
employees, together with opportunities for training and development to 
maximise personal potential. Wherever they work, employees have the 
right to be treated in good faith and with respect for the dignity of the 
individual. All Group companies must ensure that recruitment, training, 
promotion, career development, termination and similar employment-
related issues are based on individual ability, achievement, experience and 
conduct without regard to race, colour, nationality, culture, ethnic origin, 
religion, sex, sexual orientation, age, disability or any other reason not 
related to job performance or prohibited by applicable law. 20769-04  13/01/2012 Skeleton 2

Our Governance Our Financials Our Business
cooksongroup.annualreport2011.com
The Group is committed to the highest standards of corporate governance 
and transparent investor communication, as discussed in more detail in 
the “Our Governance” section of this report. 
Cookson seeks to be a good corporate citizen wherever it conducts 
business, to observe all national and local laws and take into account 
regional and local concerns, customs and traditions. 
The Cookson Code requires all employees, officers and Directors to have a 
duty of loyalty to the Group and personal interests that do, may or might 
appear to conflict with Group interests must be avoided at all times.
In response to the UK Bribery Act, the Company’s Code of Conduct was 
revised and recommunicated to all employees in 2011. New policies on 
anti-bribery & corruption have been developed. Together they require that 
employees and others working on behalf of the Company do not engage 
in any form of bribery or corruption. 
An anti-bribery and corruption compliance programme has been 
established throughout the Group, and is being implemented through a 
targeted face-to-face training programme. An e-learning module has been 
developed and is being rolled out globally, as local language versions 
become available, to relevant office-based individuals in 2012. New 
employees, if relevant, will go through the training as part of their 
induction process. The compliance programme includes undertaking risk 
assessments and engaging with others working on behalf of the Company 
to ensure that their standards comply with Cookson’s policies. 
Cookson is a member of the corporate supporters forum of Transparency 
International UK. 
EMPLOYEE HELPLINE
Cookson has a 24-hour Employee Business Concern Helpline telephone 
and e-mail facility. This is an independent and confidential service through 
which employees worldwide may register any concerns about any 
incorrect or irregular practices they perceive in Cookson’s workplaces.
HEALTH, SAFETY AND ENVIRONMENT (“HS&E”)
Cookson regards HS&E matters as mainstream management responsibilities. 
The Board has overall responsibility for the Cookson HS&E policy and for 
monitoring its implementation. Executives and line managers at all levels 
are directly responsible through the normal management structure for HS&E 
matters in the operations under their control. Particular emphasis is focused 
on the following areas:
	 ❯ Safety Performance: work-related injuries and illnesses.
	 ❯ Regulatory Compliance: compliance with permitted air, water, waste 
and noise emissions criteria.
	 ❯ Energy Usage: reducing electricity and gas consumed in our 
operations and hence carbon dioxide (“CO
2
”) emissions. 
The Group’s HS&E policy and related information can be found on the 
Group’s website — www.cooksongroup.co.uk.
A reporting system is in place to collect details of all HS&E-related 
incidents throughout the Group and to produce quarterly reports 
including the KPI covering work-related injury and illness rates. These 
reports and related performance improvement plans are regularly 
reviewed by the Chief Executive with divisional management as part of 
the normal business review cycle.
The Chief Executive’s regular report to the Board includes an overview of 
Group HS&E performance. Any significant incidents are reported to the 
Chief Executive and the Board as they occur.
Cookson’s larger manufacturing locations are progressively being qualified 
for certification under ISO 14001, the international standard for 
environmental management systems. Those facilities handling potentially 
more hazardous materials are progressively being qualified for certification 
under the international occupational health and safety management system, 
OHSAS 18001. Certification to these international standards is not 
appropriate for all facilities, particularly smaller ones and those with very 
limited environmental impact.
The Group now has 67 locations certified to ISO 14001 and 35 locations 
certified to OHSAS 18001.
SAFETY PERFORMANCE
Cookson’s goal is zero work-related injuries and illnesses. The principal 
indicators of occupational safety and health performance that are used are 
based on the US Occupational Safety and Health Administration recording 
requirements. Cookson operations worldwide report the “days away” 
incident rate — the number of work-related illnesses or injuries, per 100 
employees, that resulted in an employee being absent from work for at least 
one day. We also track the “recordable” incident rate — the number of 
work-related injuries and illnesses, per 100 employees, that resulted in 
medical treatment beyond first aid.
Cookson’s “days away” injury and illness rate has fallen from 1.53 in 2007 to 
0.55 in 2011. The Group’s “recordable” incident rate has improved to 1.36 in 
2011 from 2.60 in 2007.

Annual Report for the year ended 31 December 2011
REGULATORY COMPLIANCE
Regulatory actions against Cookson companies have been at a low level for 
several years. This is indicative of the emphasis on continuous HS&E 
performance improvement across Cookson in relation to statutory 
obligations. A small number of enforcement notices were issued to Cookson 
companies in 2011, including several that assessed minor penalties.
In connection with the European regulation for the Registration, 
Evaluation, Authorisation and Restriction of Chemicals (“REACH”), each of 
the Group’s businesses which manufacture chemicals has filed, by the 
statutory deadline, appropriate pre-registrations and has otherwise 
complied, as applicable, with the regulatory requirements for the 
registration of chemical substances.
Like many manufacturers, some Group companies have potential 
environmental liabilities because of past operations at their current or 
former sites. Where remediation is required, we work with external 
specialists and with government authorities to ensure that remediation is 
conducted effectively and efficiently.
REDUCING ENERGY USE AND CO
2
 EMISSIONS
Cookson has, for many years, operated a programme aimed at reducing 
energy use and hence the associated emissions of CO
2
. The programme 
trains employees to understand energy use and conservation principles 
and introduces energy audits to assist high-use sites in identifying and 
implementing conservation measures.
The following chart shows Cookson’s electricity and gas consumption over 
the last five years.
Energy use has been reduced markedly as a result of these initiatives, 
notwithstanding the growth in revenue. In 2008 energy use increased 
relative to 2007, due to the acquisition of the Foseco operations. Energy 
use in 2008, excluding Foseco, is also shown on the graph. In 2011 
electricity use increased marginally compared with 2010 and gas usage 
reduced by 2%, notwithstanding the increased level of manufacturing 
activity.

REVIEW OF GROUP OPERATIONS
Group revenue in 2011 of £2,826m was 
11% higher than 2010 and 9% higher on an 
underlying basis (being revenue at constant 
exchange rates and commodity metal prices). 
Demand in the Group’s key end-markets of steel 
production, foundry castings and electronics 
was generally strong during the year, although 
there was some moderate softening of steel 
production in the fourth quarter. Revenue for 
the Group was well balanced geographically 
with 35% coming from sales to customers in 
Europe, 32% from Asia-Pacific, 23% from NAFTA 
and 10% from the Rest of the World. 
Trading profit in 2011 rose significantly to 
£290.2m (2010: £252.1m), being 15% higher 
at both constant and reported exchange rates. 
Trading profit in the second half of 2011 was 1% 
lower than the first half at both constant and 
reported exchange rates. 
The return on sales margin in 2011 was 10.3%, 
ahead of the 9.9% reported in 2010. This 
improvement was achieved notwithstanding the 
impact of higher metal prices (notably for gold, 
silver and tin), which increased reported revenue 
in the Performance Materials and Precious Metals 
Processing divisions without any impact on 
profitability. The return on sales margin in 2011 
would have been 10.9% if these metal prices had 
remained at 2010 average levels.
Note: In the divisional and product line narrative 
analysis below, all of the financial information is 
presented at constant currency, unless indicated 
otherwise.
 ENGINEERED CERAMICS
Trading under the Vesuvius and 
Foseco brand names, the division is 
the world leader in the supply of 
advanced consumable products and 
systems to the global steel industry 
(which accounts for a little over half  
of revenue) and the global foundry 
industry (approximately one-third of 
revenue) and a leading supplier of 
speciality products to the glass and 
solar industries.
In 2011, the Engineered Ceramics division 
experienced strong demand in the majority of 
its end-markets. Revenue of £1,686m was 12% 
higher than 2010 (13% at reported exchange 
rates). Revenue in the second half of 2011 was 
2% lower than the first half, principally reflecting 
a moderate slowdown in steel production in the 
fourth quarter in Europe and China, and a very 
marked deterioration in the solar end-market in 
the second half. 
Trading profit in 2011 rose significantly to 
£193.2m (2010: £177.4m), being 8% higher (9% 
higher at reported exchange rates). Trading 
profit was 3% lower in the second half of 2011 
compared to the first half reflecting the lower 
revenue. The return on sales margin in 2011 
was 11.5%, marginally lower than the 11.9% 
achieved in 2010. Raw material costs rose 
significantly during the year, particularly for 
graphite, zirconia and magnesite minerals. 
Whilst compensating selling price increases 
were agreed with customers during the 
course of the year, there was some time lag in 
implementing these price increases which had a 
negative impact on margins. Margins were also 
impacted in the second half of the year by the 
marked deterioration in the solar end-market 
which significantly impacted demand for the 
division’s Solar Crucibles™ products. Excluding 
the Fused Silica business (of which Solar 
Crucibles™ represents around 50% of revenue), 
the return on sales margin for the remaining 
Engineered Ceramics division was 11.6% in 2011 
(first half: 11.3%; second half: 11.9%) compared 
to 11.3% in 2010.

Cookson Group plc  
Annual Report for the year ended 31 December 2011
OPERATING REVIEW
 
ENGINEERED CERAMICS 
The Engineered Ceramics division provides 
leading technologies to its customers supported 
by outstanding technical support and R&D 
resources. As outlined in the Capital Markets 
presentation on 26 January 2011, the division 
expects to double its R&D spend over the next 
five years. As part of this initiative, investments 
in land and facilities for R&D centres have been 
made in Pittsburgh, US and Vizag, India. 
Steel end-market: global steel production is 
the division’s main end-market corresponding 
to a little over half of its total revenue. According 
to the World Steel Association, global steel 
production was 1,527m tonnes in 2011, a 6.8% 
increase compared to 2010 and a record level of 
global steel production. Global steel production 
was marginally lower (by 4%) in the second half 
compared to the first half. 
Within these totals, steel production in China 
(which now accounts for 46% of global steel 
production) grew 8.9% in 2011 compared to 
2010. Chinese steel production grew strongly in 
the first three quarters of 2011, but then fell 
sharply in the fourth quarter as a result of 
slowing economic growth, such that production 
in the second half of 2011 was 6% lower than the 
first half. However, market trends outside of 
China are more significant for the Engineered 
Ceramics division in the short-term as China 
currently accounts for only around 12% of the 
division’s steel-related revenue. A large part of 
steel production in China is not yet based on the 
enclosed continuous casting technology which 
uses Vesuvius’ Steel Flow Control products. The 
use of enclosed continuous casting is expected 
to increase over time as the Chinese steel 
industry continues to modernise and demand for 
higher grade “flat” steel product increases. In 
November 2011, the Chinese government 
announced a new five year plan (2011 to 2015) 
for the steel industry which targets higher 
production levels of better quality, more 
value-added steel products to be produced in a 
more environmentally conscious way. In the 
Advanced Refractories product line, there is as 
yet only modest revenue arising in China as this 
market has only recently been addressed.
Excluding China, global steel production in 2011 
was 5.1% higher than in 2010 as the recovery in 
2010 continued through 2011. Steel production 
fell marginally in the third quarter of 2011, 
reflecting the normal seasonal slowdown in 
production, and then remained unchanged in 
the fourth quarter, with a moderate slowdown 
in Europe being offset by higher production in 
the US and India. Overall, steel production 
(excluding China) was only 2% lower in the 
second half compared to the first. Whilst the 
overall improvement in steel production in 2011 
is encouraging, production levels in the 
developed world are still materially below the 
levels seen prior to the 2008 economic 
downturn, suggesting scope for considerable 
further growth in steel output in the medium 
term. Production in Europe and the US in the 
fourth quarter of 2011 represented only 75% 
and 84%, respectively, of the production levels 
seen in the second quarter of 2008. 
Foundry castings end-market: this market, 
which represents around one-third of the 
division’s revenue, produces castings which 
are used in a wide variety of engineered 
products. Approximately 40% of castings (and 
therefore a similar percentage of the revenue 
for the Foundry Technologies product line) are 
produced for the vehicle sector, being 25% for 
cars and light trucks (“automotive”) and 15% for 
heavy trucks. Other end-markets for foundry 
castings include: construction, agriculture 
and mining machinery; power generation 
equipment; pipes and valves; railroad; and 
general engineering equipment. The foundry 
castings market deteriorated significantly 
towards the end of 2008 and has subsequently 
demonstrated more “late-cycle” characteristics 
in its recovery. Whilst automotive production 
started to improve from mid-2009 onwards, 
truck production (particularly in Europe) only 
started to recover from mid-2010 onwards. It 
was only towards the end of the first half of 
2010 that the Foundry Technologies business 
started to experience a more positive impact on 
its revenue, with this improvement continuing 
during the remainder of 2010 and in 2011. 
According to JD Power, in 2011 automotive 
production grew 10% in North America and 
7% in Europe, but fell 2% in the Rest of the 
World (excluding China). Truck production has 
grown strongly in 2011, albeit from a relatively 
low level in 2010, with growth of 30% in North 
America, 32% in Europe and 3% in the Rest of 
the World (excluding China).

Solar and glass end-markets: the principal 
products in the Fused Silica product line are 
Solar Crucibles™, which are used in the 
production of photovoltaic (“solar”) panels, and 
tempering rollers used mainly in the production 
of glass for construction and automotive 
applications. Demand for Solar Crucibles™ was 
good in the first half of 2011, but fell sharply in 
the second half as a number of customers cut 
production in response to excess global 
inventories of finished solar panels. This 
slowdown is expected to continue into 2012. 
However, the prospects for the solar industry in 
the medium to long-term remain very 
promising. Demand for tempering rollers 
remained strong throughout 2011. 
Steel Flow Control
The Steel Flow Control product line provides a full 
range of consumable products, systems and 
technical services to control, regulate and protect 
the flow of steel in the enclosed continuous casting 
process. Products include VISO™ and VAPEX™ 
products, slide-gate and tube changer systems 
and refractories, gas purging and temperature 
control devices, and mould and tundish fluxes.
Global steel production represents almost 100% 
of the end-market for Steel Flow Control 
products and services. Revenue of £533m was 
8% higher compared to 2010. This growth rate 
was marginally ahead of the increase in steel 
production in the key markets in which Vesuvius 
operates, reflecting favourable product mix, 
including increased market penetration of its 
new, higher value-added, tundish tube changer 
and ladle shroud products, and the partial 
pass-through of higher raw material costs.
The cost of some of the key raw materials used 
in Steel Flow Control products rose significantly 
throughout the year, notably for graphite and 
zirconia. Whilst compensating selling price 
increases were agreed with customers 
throughout the year, there was some time lag in 
implementing these price increases. 
In line with the strategy, announced in January 
2011, of making “bolt-on” acquisitions to 
complement our existing product and service 
offering, we completed the acquisition of SERT 
in November for a net cash consideration of 
€11m (£9m). This business, headquartered in 
France, is a world leader in the development 
and manufacture of systems for the automation 
of the casting process of molten metals within 
steel mills and foundries. In 2011, SERT had 
revenue of €11m (£9m) and a trading profit of 
€2m (£2m). 
A project to double manufacturing capacity at 
the Indian facility in Kolkata was completed in 
the first half of 2011. The first phase of the 
project to double the capacity of the existing 
facility in Trinec, Czech Republic to service more 
effectively the Eastern Europe and CIS markets 
was completed at the end of the year. A new 
facility is being built in Brazil to improve the 
efficiency of raw material processing.
Advanced Refractories
Advanced Refractories includes products 
and services that enable customers’ plants to 
withstand the effects of extreme temperatures 
or erosive chemical attack and reduce energy 
consumption and carbon emissions. The business 
manufactures castables, gunning materials, 
ramming mixes, pre-cast shapes, tap hole clay, 
bricks, mortars, and provides construction and 
installation services.
Global iron and steel production represents 
more than 75% of the end-market for Advanced 
Refractories’ products and services with the 
remainder arising from a variety of non-steel 
markets including the cement, lime, aluminium, 
power generation, petrochemical and waste 
incineration industries. 
Revenue of £545m represented an 11% increase 
compared to 2010. The growth reflected 
increased levels of maintenance as steel 
producers increased production, and the pass-
through of some higher raw material prices. 
As with Steel Flow Control, there were 
significant raw materials cost increases in 
the year. However, prices for magnesite — 
the single most important raw material for 
Advanced Refractories — did stabilise in the 
second half of the year following large increases 
in the first half. 
Production capacity at our Chinese specialist 
magnesia carbon brick-lining business, BRC, has 
been increased by around one-half through the 
installation of additional automated presses.

OPERATING REVIEW
 
Foundry Technologies
The Foundry Technologies business is a leading 
supplier of consumable products and technical 
services to the foundry industry worldwide and 
trades under the Foseco brand name. Products 
include feeding systems, filters, metal treatments, 
metal transfer systems, crucibles, stoppers, sand 
binders, coatings and moulding materials used in
the production of metal castings. These products 
improve quality and yields whilst reducing energy 
consumption and production costs.
Revenue of £527m represented a 19% increase 
compared to 2010. There has been strong growth 
in most regions, particularly Northern Europe 
(especially Germany which accounted for just 
under 20% of revenue), NAFTA, Japan and India, 
reflecting the strong demand in these markets 
for cars, trucks, and equipment for the mining, 
agriculture, construction, power generation 
and general engineering industries. Southern 
European markets are recovering more slowly. 
Revenue in the second half of 2011 was just over 
90% of the revenue achieved in the first half of 
2008 (pro forma for Foseco), reflecting the strong 
recovery of this business in the last two years. 
Customer demand for the INITEK™ system, 
launched in June 2011, has been strong with 
six systems now in operation, six in the process 
of being commissioned and a further thirty five 
under negotiation with potential customers. 
The INITEK™ system is based on a proprietary 
combination of additives and processes in 
a purpose-designed converter vessel which 
significantly improves casting quality and 
reduces customers’ production costs by some 
10% through reductions in the consumption of 
energy and materials. 
The manufacturing facility in Chambery, France 
was closed in the first half of the year with 
production transferring to existing facilities in 
Poland and India. Additional production capacity 
for filters and feeding systems is also being 
installed in our facilities in the UK and Japan, 
respectively, for completion in early 2012. 
The Chinese foundry castings end-market is 
expected to grow strongly over the next few 
years. In anticipation of this growth, it has been 
decided to build a new production facility in 
China. A number of locations are currently 
under evaluation.
Fused Silica
The principal products in the Fused Silica product 
line are Solar Crucibles™ used in the manufacture 
of photovoltaic (“solar”) panels and tempering 
rollers used in the glass industry. 
Revenue of £81m represented a 6% increase 
compared to 2010. Solar Crucibles™ revenue, 
which represents around 50% of total Fused 
Silica revenue, decreased by 7% compared to 
2010. Demand for Solar Crucibles™ was good in 
the first half of 2011, but fell sharply in the 
second half of the year as a number of 
customers cut production in response to excess 
global inventories of finished solar panels. 
Revenue in the second half of the year was less 
than half that of the first half. Some recovery in 
this market is expected in the second half of 
2012, but there is considerable uncertainty as to 
the timing and rate of that recovery. Steps have 
been taken to adapt to these market conditions 
by removing temporary workers and adopting 
some short-time working arrangements in 
Europe, and via some permanent workforce 
reductions in our Chinese operations. In 
addition, a number of technological innovations 
have been developed both to improve product 
quality and also to enable us to significantly 
reduce production costs, and hence improve 
competitiveness, in anticipation of a recovery in 
solar market volumes at some stage in 2012. 
These initiatives include the doubling of 
capacity of the line for production of the 
recently introduced “ready to use”(“RTU”) Solar 
Crucibles™ in the facility in Skawina, Poland 
which was completed in the third quarter of 
2011. RTU Solar Crucibles™ are crucibles 
pre-coated with a patented solution which 
increases customers’ manufacturing 
productivity. A new raw material processing 
plant has also recently been completed in China 
which allows the sourcing of cheaper raw 
materials from a wider variety of sources and 
which also enables the supply of processed 
materials to our European factories. 
Whilst the solar industry is currently very 
depressed, prospects for the medium to 
long-term remain very promising. Solar panels’ 
costs have reduced significantly in recent years 
and, as a result, “grid parity” (at which electricity 
from solar panels is produced at a cost, before 
government subsidies, which is not more than 
the price charged by utilities) is being achieved 
in an increasing number of geographic regions. 
For glass tempering rollers and other speciality 
products used in the manufacture of glass, 
revenue increased 25% compared to 2010 with 
end-market demand remaining satisfactory 
throughout the year.

 PERFORMANCE MATERIALS
The division is a world leading  
supplier of electronic assembly 
materials and advanced surface 
treatment and plating chemicals.  
 The electronic equipment  
production end-market accounts for 
approximately three-quarters of 
revenue with the other quarter being 
direct applications (non-electronics)  
in automotive and industrial 
production.  The division comprises  
two businesses, Joining Technologies, 
which is a supplier of solder, fluxes, 
adhesives, and related products, and 
Surface Chemistries, which is a  
supplier of electro-plating chemicals.
According to estimates from Henderson 
Ventures, global production of electronic 
equipment (measured in US dollars at constant 
currency) grew in 2011 by 1.7%. Global PC unit 
shipments (both traditional and tablet PCs) 
were estimated to be 13% higher, with tablet 
units increasing by more than three times from 
20m units in 2010 to 67m units in 2011. Global 
unit shipments of mobile phones increased by 
12% to 1.8bn compared to 2010, with just over 
one-quarter of these being more technically 
sophisticated smartphones compared to just 
under 20% in 2010. Automotive markets have 
shown good improvement, particularly for 
higher value vehicles which typically use more 
of the division’s products.
Revenue of £814m was 13% higher than 2010 at 
both constant and reported exchange rates.

Our Governance Our Financials Our Business

The higher revenue largely reflects the “pass 
through” to customers of higher tin and silver 
prices, both major raw materials for Joining 
Technologies, and higher gold and palladium 
prices in the Surface Chemistries business. In 
2011, the average prices of tin, silver and gold 
were respectively 35%, 83% and 29% higher 
than 2010, such that approximately £111m of 
the division’s revenue increase was as a result of 
these higher metal prices. Excluding the impact 
of these commodity metals and adjusting for 
a small disposal in December 2010, underlying 
revenue was 1% higher than 2010. These trends 
reflect the division’s strong market positions 
in the faster growth market segments within 
consumer electronics (such as tablets and 
smartphones), the continuing strategy of exiting 
more commoditised products (particularly bar 
solder, where volumes fell by 14%), and the 
increased market penetration of innovative, 
higher margin products such as advanced 
solder pastes and “tape and reel” packaged 
solder pre-forms. Asia-Pacific, the division’s 
largest region, accounted for just under half of 
revenue in 2011 (by location of customer). 
In 2011, the division’s revenue included £206m 
of tin, £122m of silver, and £68m of gold and 
palladium. Net sales value (which excludes 
these amounts from revenue) in 2011 was 
£418m, 2% higher than 2010 (as reported). 
As a result of the improving mix in the 
profitability of revenue, trading profit for 
2011 rose significantly to £99.6m (2011: 
£71.0m), a 40% increase at both constant and 
reported exchange rates. The return on sales 
margin in 2011 was 12.2%, well ahead of the 
9.8% reported in 2010. The pass through to 
customers of the higher tin and precious metals 
commodity prices discussed above increased 
revenue by some £111m but had no material 
impact on trading profit. The return on sales 
margin in 2011 would have been 14.2% if metal 
prices had remained at average 2010 levels. 
The return on net sales value in 2011 was 23.8%, 
well ahead of the 17.3% as reported in 2010. 
Management believes this measure, which 
eliminates the impact of the pass through of 
commodity metals, is an important measure of 
the underlying profitability of the division.
Joining Technologies
Joining Technologies is a leading global supplier of 
materials to assemblers of printed circuit boards 
(“PCBs”) and the semi-conductor packaging industry 
and to certain non-electronics markets such as 
automotive and water treatment. Its principal brand 
name is Alpha and products include solder (in bar, 
wire, paste, powder and sphere form) and fluxes, 
adhesives, cleaning chemicals and stencils.
Revenue of £527m was 17% higher than 2010 
(18% at reported exchange rates). Excluding the 
impact of passing through higher tin and silver 
prices and adjusting for a small disposal in 
December 2010, on an underlying basis revenue 
was 1% higher than 2010. This reflects the 
growth in the global production of electronic 
equipment, the continuation of the successful 
strategy to focus on higher margin, enhanced 
technology products, and exiting more 
commoditised products such as bar solder. For 
solder products, which account for three-
quarters of Joining Technologies’ revenue, sales 
of higher margin advanced solder pastes were up 
8% by weight compared to 2011 while bar solder 
was down 14%, partially reflecting the 
continuing shift from wave soldering to surface 
mount technology for the production of PCBs. 
Sales of tape-and-reel packaged pre-forms, 
which are manufactured shapes of solder used in 
jointing applications requiring high physical 
strength, have almost doubled in the year driven, 
in particular, by smartphone applications. The 
recycling, reclaim business in the US and China, 
in which scrap solder generated by our 
customers’ production processes is reclaimed for 
processing back into solder alloys for sale to third 
parties or for reuse within the business, also 
benefited from strong growth during the year. 
Net sales value (which excludes the value of tin 
and silver from revenue) in 2011 was £199m, 1% 
higher than 2010. 
The business continues to focus on new product 
development and on penetrating new markets, 
including LED, solar and power electronics. These 
new products include Ready Ribbon™, a 
pre-fluxed, solder coated, copper ribbon used for 
connecting solar cells within a solar panel, and 
nano-silver die attach products for use in the 
manufacture of LED lights and power electronics. 
Related new production lines for Ready Ribbon™ 
were completed towards the end of 2011 in the 
Netherlands and Singapore, and a further line in 
the US is nearing completion. The first nano-silver

production line in Singapore has also now been 
successfully commissioned. Both products 
attracted high levels of customer interest ahead of 
their recent commercial launch and, once product 
trials are completed by our customers, commercial 
sales are expected to commence shortly. 
A new solder bar, wire, paste and chemicals 
factory has been built in Manaus, Brazil, which 
went into production in December 2011.
Surface Chemistries
The Surface Chemistries product line 
manufactures speciality electro-plating chemicals 
under the trade name Enthone. Approximately 
45% of sales are to the electronics industry and 
55% to industrial and automotive applications.
Revenue of £287m for 2011 was 5% higher than 
2010 at both constant and reported exchange 
rates. Net sales value (which excludes the value of 
gold and palladium from revenue) in 2011 was 
£219m, 2% higher than 2010. Compared to 2010, 
sales of plating-on-plastics and corrosion and wear 
resistant products for automotive and industrial 
applications were up 3%. Sales of surface coating 
products serving the PCB fabrication market were 
up 1%, with growth of the Immersion Tin PCB 
surface finish product up over 50%, driven by 
automotive electronics market share gains. Sales 
of proprietary Copper Damascene additives into 
the semi-conductor market were up 18% 
compared to 2010. The first qualification for 
Copper Damascene additives for use in the 
recently launched 22 nanometre semi-conductor 
wafer node was achieved in the year. 
The construction of the new £14m Chemistry 
facility in Shanghai, to serve China’s growing 
electronic materials, automotive and industrial 
end-markets, is now expected to be completed 
in the third quarter of 2012. Currently the 
Chinese market is served from Cookson facilities 
in Tianjin and Singapore. 
 PRECIOUS METALS PROCESSING
The division is a leading supplier of 
fabricated precious metals (primarily 
gold, silver and platinum) to the 
jewellery industry in the UK, France 
and Spain, and also has significant 
precious metal recycling operations.
The Precious Metals Processing division 
operated during 2011 in two distinct 
geographic regions: the US, which constituted 
37% of the total net sales value (being revenue 
excluding the precious metals content), and 
Europe (focused on the UK, France and Spain). 
Average precious metal prices in 2011 have 
been significantly higher than for 2010, being 
approximately 29% higher for gold, 83% for 
silver and 9% for platinum. 
Net sales value of £132m in 2011 was in line 
with 2010. The European businesses performed 
well during the year, benefiting from high 
levels of precious metal reclaim activity, 
stimulated by the high price of gold. However, 
the performance of the US business was 
unsatisfactory, particularly in the second half of 
the year.
Trading profit in 2011 at £6.2m was £6.5m 
below 2010. The division made a trading 
profit of £6.7m in the first half of 2011 but 
made a small loss in the second half. Whilst 
the European businesses maintained a good 
level of profitability throughout the year, the 
US business, which had operated at around 
break-even in the first half, incurred losses in the 
second half as previously communicated. The 
return on net sales value for the division in 2011 
was 4.7%, below the 9.5% achieved in 2010.
In November 2011, we announced that we 
had initiated a strategic review and significant 
downsizing of the US operations. Subsequently 
we entered into negotiations with Richline 
Group, Inc. for it to acquire these US operations 
and on 22 February the parties signed a 
binding Sale and Purchase agreement, which is 
subject to normal legal and regulatory closing 
provisions which we anticipate to be completed 
in the second quarter of 2012. The net cash 
consideration is subject to closing balance sheet 
adjustments, but is expected to be sufficient for 
the exit from the loss-making US business to be 
cash neutral, including the restructuring and 
other costs incurred in preparing the business 
for sale. The division’s profitable European 
operations are unaffected by the transaction.

 Dividends are presented on an “as recommended” basis.
As described in detail in the Operating Review, the majority of the Group’s 
businesses experienced improved end-market conditions during 2011 
and, as a result, the trading profit in 2011 of £290.2m was 15% higher than 
in 2010.  
After net finance costs (pre-exceptional items) of £28.7m, headline profit 
before tax was £261.5m. The Group’s reported effective tax rate increased 
in 2011 to 23.5% from 21.1% in 2010; however, the prior year rate reflected 
a number of non-recurring credits and the underlying tax rate, excluding 
the benefit of these non-recurring credits, was around 24% in 2010.  A tax 
rate of around 23.5% is anticipated for 2012.
The increase in the Group’s trading profit more than offset the increase in 
the reported effective tax rate, resulting in headline profit after tax of 
£200.1m, 14% higher than 2010.  Similarly, headline earnings per share of 
70.4p was 14% higher than the 61.5p in 2010, reflecting the higher 
headline profit after tax.
The Board is recommending to shareholders a final dividend for 2011 of 
14.50p per share, an increase of 26% on the final dividend of 11.50p in 
2010. This, together with the interim dividend of 7.25p (2010: nil), gives a 
total dividend for the year of 21.75p (2010: 11.50p).
Net debt as at 31 December 2011 was £363.9m, £34.2m higher than  
31 December 2010, resulting in a leverage ratio (net debt to EBITDA) of  
1.1 times.  
GROUP INCOME STATEMENT

Net finance costs (interest) were £1.7m lower than in 2010 principally due 
to a £1.3m lower charge for pension interest. 
Items excluded from headline profit before tax
A net charge of £49.9m was incurred in 2011 (2010: £32.7m) for the 
following items excluded from headline profit before tax:
Amortisation of intangible assets: costs of £17.8m (2010: £17.7m) were 
incurred in 2011 relating to intangible assets (customer relationships, 
intellectual property rights and the Foseco trade name) arising on the 
acquisition of Foseco in April 2008. These intangible assets are being 
amortised over lives varying between 10 and 20 years.  
Restructuring charges: the £8.9m incurred in 2011 (2010: £17.3m) 
comprises total costs of £11.7m, less profits of £2.8m arising on the sale of 
vacant property. Of the costs of £11.7m, £8.2m arose in Engineered 
Ceramics and £3.5m in Performance Materials, both principally from 
headcount reductions.
Restructuring charges of between £5m and £10m are expected to be 
incurred in 2012.     
Gains relating to employee benefits plans: the £15.2m credit in 2011 (2010: 
£5.3m) is principally in respect of the UK defined benefit pension plan (“UK 
Plan”) and principally comprises a credit of £21.5m relating to the change 
in the UK inflation index (from RPI to CPI) which is used to value deferred 
pension benefits, less a charge of £8.3m in respect of an enhanced transfer 
value (“ETV”) exercise under which deferred members are being offered 
the opportunity to transfer their accrued pension benefits out of the UK 
Plan.  This exercise eliminates longevity and investment risk for Cookson in 
respect of the amounts transferred out of the UK Plan. The cost of the ETV 
exercise reflected in 2011 is only in respect of transfers agreed prior to  
“Cookson ended 2011 with a strong balance 
sheet and with ample liquidity headroom under 
long-term financing arrangements. ”

Cookson Group plc  
Annual Report for the year ended 31 December 2011
31 December 2011.  A further charge of some £5m is expected to be 
incurred in 2012 in respect of any transfers agreed after 1 January 2012.      
Finance costs — exceptional items: costs of £1.9m (2010: £3.0m) were 
incurred in 2011 arising from the write-off of unamortised borrowing costs 
relating to the syndicated bank facility which was terminated in April 2011 
following the negotiation of a new facility.
Loss on disposal of continuing operations: a net loss of £36.5m (2010: £0.6m) 
was incurred in 2011, of which £29.0m relates to the US business of the 
Precious Metals Processing division that was in the process of being 
disposed of as at 31 December 2011 and was therefore recorded as held 
for sale at that date.  On being classified as held for sale the net assets of 
the business were written down to their fair value less costs to sell.  
Subsequent to year-end, an agreement was signed on 22 February 2012 
with Richline Group, Inc. (a subsidiary of Berkshire Hathaway Inc.) for it to 
acquire the Group’s interest in this business.
Group profit before tax and after the items noted above was £211.6m for 
2011 compared to a profit before tax of £189.4m in 2010.
Taxation
The tax charge on ordinary activities was £61.4m on headline profit before 
tax of £261.5m, an effective tax rate (before share of post-tax profit from 
joint ventures) of 23.5%. The effective tax rate in 2010 was 21.1%, although 
this reflected the benefit of a number of non-recurring credits. The 
underlying effective tax rate for 2010 was around 24%.
Whilst the Group’s effective tax rate going forward will be affected by the 
geographic split of profit before tax, it is currently expected that the 
effective tax rate for 2012 will be around 23.5%.
A tax credit of £2.5m (2010: £9.4m) arose in relation to all the items 
excluded from headline profit before tax noted above.  
Profit attributable to owners of the parent
Headline attributable profit for 2011 was £194.2m (2010: £169.8m), an 
increase of 14%. Profit attributable to non-controlling interests of £5.9m 
was £0.3m higher than for 2010.  
After taking account of all items excluded from headline profit before tax 
noted above (net of the related tax impact), the Group recorded a profit of 
£146.8m for 2011 (2010: £145.3m). 
Return on investment (“ROI”)
The Group’s post-tax ROI in 2011 was 10.3%, ahead of the 9.6% reported in 
2010, reflecting the improvement in trading performance during the year.  
Earnings per share (“EPS”)
Headline EPS, based on the headline profit attributable to owners of the 
parent divided by the average number of shares in issue, amounted to 
70.4p per share in 2011, 14% higher than the 61.5p in 2010. The Board 
believes this basis of calculating EPS is an important measure of the 
underlying earnings per share of the Group. Basic EPS, based on the net 
profit attributable to owners of the parent, was 53.2p (2010: 53.0p). 
The average number of shares in issue during 2011 was 275.7m, 0.5m 
lower than for 2010.
Dividend and dividend policy
In the Capital Markets presentation on 26 January 2011, it was stated that 
one of the financial targets for the three year period to 2013 was that 
dividends would grow at least in line with earnings growth. It was also 
noted that the Board’s intention is to balance the split of interim and final 
dividends broadly on a one-third/two-thirds basis.  
Given the good trading performance in 2011 and the outlook for 2012, the 
Board is recommending a final dividend of 14.50p per share (2010: 11.50p) 
which, together with the interim dividend of 7.25p per share, gives a total 
dividend for the year of 21.75p per share (2010: 11.50p). The final dividend, 
if approved at the Annual General Meeting on 17 May 2012, is to be paid 
on 11 June 2012 to shareholders on the register on 4 May 2012. Any 
shareholder wishing to participate in the Cookson Dividend Reinvestment 
Plan (“DRIP”) needs to have submitted their election to do so by 24 May 
2012.
GROUP CASH FLOW
Net cash inflow from operating activities
In 2011, the Group generated £159.8m of net cash inflow from operating 
activities, £50.2m higher than in 2010.

Taxation paid (55.9) (48.2) (7.7)
Net operating cash inflow 159.8 109.6 50.2
The cash outflow of £86.8m from trade and other working capital reflects 
the strong increase in underlying revenue in 2011 and the high level of 
commodity metal prices at year-end. The higher levels of trade working 
capital resulted in a ratio of average trade working capital to sales in 2011 
of 23.1%, two percentage points higher than for 2010. 
Cash outflow for restructuring was £13.2m, of which the majority related to 
trailing costs from the cost-saving initiatives in the Engineered Ceramics and 
Performance Materials divisions commenced in prior years. A cash outflow 
for restructuring of around £10m is expected in 2012. The cash impact of the 
disposal of the US Precious Metals Processing business, which is expected to 
complete in the second quarter  of 2012, is expected to be broadly neutral.
The cash outflow for additional pension plan funding contributions 
included the following:
UK Plan: payments totalling £7.0m were made into the UK Plan in 2011 
based upon the current agreement with the Trustee. The level of these 
payments will be reviewed based on the UK Plan’s next triennial valuation 
as of December 2012, which should be available in mid-2013. 
US defined benefits pension plans: additional payments totalling £6.2m 
were made into the US pension plans in 2011, in line with the previously 
announced intention to make additional “top-up’”payments of 
approximately £6m per annum into the plans with effect from the 
beginning of 2011.

Net cash flows from investing activities
Capital expenditure: payments to acquire property, plant and equipment in 
2011 were £85.1m, £27.9m higher than 2010 and representing 151% of 
depreciation (2010: 106%). A cash outflow for capital expenditure of 
around £75m is expected in 2012 principally reflecting the expansion of 
production capacity in China, India, Brazil, Eastern Europe, and the Middle 
East; customer installations in the Engineered Ceramics and Performance 
Materials divisions; and the expansion of R&D facilities in the Engineered 
Ceramics division. 
Acquisition of subsidiaries and joint ventures: net cash outflow in 2011 was 
£11.3m (2010: £3.9m), primarily comprising the Engineered Ceramics 
division’s acquisition of SERT for €11m (£9m) on 23 November 2011 and 
also the division’s further investment in the Advanced Refractories joint 
venture in China with Angang Steel, one of China’s largest steel producers. 
Free cash flow
Free cash flow is defined as net cash flow from operating activities after 
net outlays for capital expenditure, dividends received from joint ventures 
and paid to non-controlling shareholders, but before additional funding 
contributions to Group pension plans.
Free cash inflow for 2011 was £90.1m, £26.4m higher than 2010, due to the 
£50.2m increase in net cash flow from operating activities, for the reasons 
described above, more than offsetting the £27.9m increase in capital 
expenditure.  
The Group normally experiences weaker free cash flows in the first half of 
the year compared with the second half, due to the seasonality of trade 
working capital cash flows. In 2011, free cash inflow in the second half 
of the year was £119.4m compared to a free cash outflow of £29.3m in 
the first half. This normal trade working capital seasonality is expected to 
continue in 2012.   
Net cash flow before financing
Net cash inflow before financing for 2011 was £56.4m, £4.6m higher than 
2010 due principally to the increase in free cash flow described above.
Cash flow from financing activities
Net cash outflow from financing activities (before movement in 
borrowings) was £92.8m (2010: £6.9m), principally comprising the 
following:
Settlement of forward foreign exchange contracts: a cash outflow of £27.6m 
arose relating to the settlement during the year of forward foreign 
exchange contracts, in particular those relating to the Singapore dollar 
and US dollar (2010: £3.3m). These forward foreign exchange contracts 
had been taken out in previous years to align broadly the currency profile 
of the Group’s borrowings with the net assets of the Group and formed 
part of the hedge on investments of the Group’s foreign investments.  
Purchase of treasury shares: a cash outflow of £7.8m (2010: £nil) arose in 
respect of the purchase during 2011 of shares in Cookson Group plc to 
satisfy the actual and potential vesting of shares under the Group’s 
share-based payment plans.  
Dividends paid: a cash outflow of £51.8m (2010: £nil) arose in respect of the 
payment in June 2011 of the final dividend for 2010 of £31.8m and the 
payment in October 2011 of the interim dividend for 2011 of £20.0m.
Net cash (outflow)/inflow and movement in net debt
Net cash outflow for 2011 (before movement in borrowings) was £36.4m 
compared to a net cash inflow of £44.9m in 2010.
With a £1.0m positive foreign exchange adjustment and £1.2m in other 
non-cash movements, this resulted in an increase in net debt from 
£329.7m at 31 December 2010 to £363.9m at 31 December 2011, an 
increase of £34.2m.
Net debt
The net debt of £363.9m as at 31 December 2011 was primarily drawn on 
available committed facilities of £884m. The Group’s net debt comprised 
the following:
31 Dec 
2011
£m
31 Dec 
2010 
£m 
US Private Placement Loan Notes (US$440m) 283.7 282.2
Committed bank facility 260.5 223.2
Lease financing 4.1 3.8

Gross borrowings 552.0 516.4
Cash and short-term deposits (188.1) (186.7) 
Net debt 363.9 329.7 
In December 2010, the Group issued US$250m of new US Private 
Placement loan notes. The notes were issued in two series: US$110m at a 
fixed interest rate of 4.16% — maturing in December 2017, and US$140m 
at a fixed interest rate of 4.87% — maturing in December 2020. The 
average weighted interest rate on the new notes is 4.57% and the average 
weighted duration from issuance is 8.7 years. The remaining US$190m of 
US Private Placement loan notes are repayable in May 2012 and have an 
average fixed interest rate of 8.1%. 
In April 2011, the Group entered into a new £600m revolving credit facility 
with a syndicate of banks to replace the existing £511m bank facility which 
was due to mature in October 2012. The new facility matures in April 2016.  
In the Capital Markets presentation on 26 January 2011, it was stated 
as part of the financial targets for the three year period to 2013 that the 
Group would maintain a strong financial position with a leverage ratio 
(net debt to EBITDA ratio) of not more than 1.5 times at year-end and 1.75 
times at the half year. The Group is currently operating very comfortably 
within this limit and, as at 31 December 2011, the net debt to EBITDA 
ratio was 1.1 times (as compared with not more than 3.25 times for bank 
covenant purposes). Also as at 31 December 2011, the ratio of EBITDA to 
interest on borrowings was 15.1 times (as compared with not less than 4.0 
times for bank covenant purposes). Based on these covenant ratios, the 
Group will pay a margin of 95bps over LIBOR on its borrowings under the 
committed bank facility.   
As at 31 December 2011, the Group had undrawn committed debt 
facilities totalling around £340m.  20769-04  13/01/2012 Skeleton 2

Cookson Group plc  
Annual Report for the year ended 31 December 2011
Currently around two-thirds of the Group’s current gross borrowings are at 
fixed interest rates for an average period of just under four years from 
December 2011. This reflects both the fixed interest rate nature of the US 
Private Placement loan notes and the Group entering into a number of 
interest rate swaps.
Currency
In 2011, the net translation impact of using 2011 rates to translate 2010 
results was not material, i.e. an increase in 2010 revenue of £4m and an 
increase of 2010 trading profit by £1.2m. Between these years, the average 
exchange rates for sterling strengthened against the US dollar by 4% 
and the Polish zloty by 2%, but weakened against both the euro and the 
Chinese renminbi by 1%, the Brazilian real by 2% and the Czech koruna by 
4%. 
The Group has a policy of broadly matching the currency of borrowings to 
the currency of operating activities for its major trading currencies.  
Currently, just over half of the Group’s gross borrowings are non-sterling 
denominated, principally in US dollars and euros.
Pension fund and other post-retirement obligations
The Group operates defined contribution and defined benefit pension 
plans, principally in the UK, the US and Germany. In addition, the Group 
has various other post-retirement defined benefit arrangements, being 
principally healthcare arrangements in the US. The Group’s principal 
defined benefit pension plans in the UK and the US are closed to new 
members and to further accruals for existing members.
As at 31 December 2011, there was a net deficit of £58.7m in respect of 
employee benefits. The reduction of £55.1m from the net deficit as at  
31 December 2010 of £113.8m primarily arose in respect of the UK 
arrangements, as a result of a strong asset performance more than 
offsetting the impact of the reduction in the applicable discount rate. The 
deficit in the Group’s US pension arrangements increased by £6.9m to 
£64.8m, due mainly to the reduction in the applicable discount rate. The 
net deficit in the plans in the remainder of the Group was broadly the 
same as at the end of 2010.
The total Group net deficit comprises a surplus of £65.6m relating to 
Cookson’s UK defined benefit plan (“the UK Plan”), deficits of £64.8m 
relating to the Group’s defined benefit pension plans in the US, £35.3m to 
pension plans in Germany, £14.5m to pension arrangements in other 
countries, and £9.7m to other, unfunded, post-retirement defined benefit 
arrangements.
The UK government implemented, with effect from 1 January 2011, the use 
of the Consumer Price Index (“CPI”) instead of the Retail Prices Index (“RPI”) 
for the purpose of determining statutory minimum pension increases for 
private sector pension schemes. During the year, the deferred members of 
the UK Plan were advised of the change from the use of RPI to value their 
benefit to the use of CPI, with effect from 1 January 2011. At the same time, 
deferred members were advised that the Company was to offer them the 
opportunity to transfer their benefits out of the UK Plan to another 
arrangement of their choice at an enhanced value, calculated to reflect the 
retention of RPI to value any deferred benefits so transferred. The offer of 
enhanced transfer values closes during the first half of 2012. This exercise 
eliminates the longevity and investment risk for Cookson in respect of the 
£37m of liabilities transferred out of the UK Plan. The impact on the IAS 19 
valuation of UK pension liabilities of the change from RPI to CPI and of the 
impact of the transfers agreed up to 31 December 2011, result in a net 
reduction in liabilities of £13.2m, which has been reported in the Group 
income statement as an exceptional credit. The impact of transfers agreed 
after 1 January 2012 will be reported as an exceptional charge in 2012.
In accordance with a schedule of contributions agreed between the 
Company and the UK Plan Trustee, the Company is making ‘top-up’ 
payments of £7.0m per annum until February 2016, targeted at 
eliminating by that date the UK Plan deficit of £54.5m per the 2009 
triennial actuarial valuation. The level of “top-up” payments will be 
reviewed based on the UK Plan’s next triennial valuation as of December 
2012, which should be available in mid-2013.
The UK Plan assets include a liability-driven investment portfolio of 
financial derivative contracts which significantly reduces the risk that the 
UK Plan’s assets will fall materially relative to the value of its projected 
liabilities for meeting future pension payments (the UK Plan’s “economic 
liabilities”). When there is a stable relationship between the swap yields 
relevant to the UK Plan’s derivatives and the corporate bond yields used 
for the IAS 19 discount rate, the UK Plan’s hedging strategy should deliver 
a broadly stable “funding ratio” (the ratio of plan assets to plan liabilities) 
not just in relation to the UK Plan’s economic liabilities, but also under an 
IAS 19 basis of valuation. As at 31 December 2011, the estimated 
“economic” funding position showed a funding ratio of 97%, whilst the IAS 
19 valuation showed a funding ratio of 116%. This represents a valuation 
difference of around £80m, reflecting the use of more prudent valuation 
assumptions for deriving the economic funding position, the basis by 
which the Company continues to fund the UK Plan.
Additional “top-up” payments of approximately £6m per annum are 
currently being made into the US pension plans. The total charge against 
trading profit in the income statement in 2011 for all pension plans 
(including defined contribution plans) was £22.4m, broadly in line with 
2010. Included within net finance charges was £2.3m (2010: £3.6m); and 
reported as exceptional curtailment credits was £15.2m (2010: £5.3m). 
Total pension cash contributions amounted to £41.1m in 2011 (2010: 
£40.5m), which included £13.2m (2010: £11.6m) of additional cash funding 
contributions into the UK and US plans.

Cookson Group plc  
Annual Report for the year ended 31 December 2011
CORPORATE GOVERNANCE REPORT
This report describes the Company’s corporate governance structure and 
explains how the Company applies the principles of the UK Corporate 
Governance Code issued by the Financial Reporting Council in May 2010 
(“the Code”). The Company has complied with the provisions of the Code 
throughout the year ended 31 December 2011.
THE BOARD
Ultimate responsibility for the management of Cookson rests with the 
Board of Directors. The Board focuses primarily upon strategic and policy 
issues. It approves the Group’s strategy, oversees the allocation of 
resources and monitors the performance of the Group in pursuit of this.
Composition
The Board currently has nine Directors, comprising the Non-executive 
Chairman, Jeff Harris; the Chief Executive, Nick Salmon; the Group Finance 
Director, Mike Butterworth; the Chief Executive Officer of the Engineered 
Ceramics Division, François Wanecq; and five Non-executive Directors. The 
Board considers each of the Non-executive Directors, namely Emma 
FitzGerald, Jeff Hewitt, Peter Hill, Jan Oosterveld and John Sussens, to be 
independent of management and free from any business or other 
relationship which could affect the exercise of their independent 
judgement. The Chairman satisfied the independence criteria on his 
appointment to the Board.
The Company has reviewed the availability of the Non-executive Directors 
and considers that each of them is able to, and in practice does, devote the 
necessary amount of time to the Company’s business. The Board nominates 
one of the Non-executive Directors to act as Senior Independent Director 
and provide an alternative contact at Board level, other than the Chairman, 
to whom shareholder matters can be addressed. Mr Sussens continues to 
hold this position. The biographical details of the Directors are set out on 
page 21.
The Code recommends that all Directors of FTSE 350 companies be subject 
to annual election by shareholders. The full Board stood for election at the 
2011 AGM. All the Directors will again be offering themselves for election 
at this year’s AGM as set out in the Notice of AGM and on page 33. 
Responsibilities and meetings
The Board has a formal schedule of matters reserved to it and delegates 
certain matters to committees as outlined below. The Board convened on 
seven formal scheduled occasions during 2011 as well as holding a 
number of ad hoc committee meetings to consider non-routine business. 
In addition, the Chairman and the other Non-executive Directors meet 
routinely on their own without the executive Directors present and at least 
once each year the Non-executive Directors meet without the Chairman 
present to discuss matters such as the Chairman’s performance.
Specific matters reserved for the Board include: reviewing Group and 
divisional performance; approving significant transactions including 
acquisitions, divestments, capital expenditure and changes to the Group’s 
capital structure; setting and approving the Group’s strategy and annual 
budget; approving the Group’s financing and treasury policies; declaration 
of dividends; succession planning; and approving Board appointments 
and the remuneration of the Non-executive Directors. In addition, the 
Board considers health, safety and environmental matters and maintains 
overall responsibility for the Group’s system of internal control and risk 
management processes.
The division of responsibilities between the Chairman and the Chief 
Executive has been agreed by the Board and is set out in writing. The 
Chairman leads the Board, while the Chief Executive manages the Group 
and implements the strategy and policies adopted by the Board. The 
Chairman meets routinely with the Chief Executive and Group Secretary to 
discuss relevant matters. The Chairman also serves as Chairman of Filtrona 
plc and, in 2011, joined the board of WH Smith PLC as a non-executive 
director. The Board considers that the Chairman is able to, and does, 
devote sufficient time to his duties at Cookson.
The attendance of Directors who served during the year at Board and 
principal committee meetings during the year, together with the 
maximum number of meetings in the period when the individual was a 
Board member (as shown in brackets), was as follows:

Non-attendance at meetings is rare and generally only arises if a Director is 
incapacitated due to serious illness (as was the case for Mr Hill) or where a 
newly appointed Director has an unavoidable commitment that cannot be 
rearranged (as was the case for Dr FitzGerald). 
Papers are provided to the Directors in advance of the relevant Board or 
committee meeting to enable them to make further enquiries about any 
matters prior to the meeting should they so wish. This also allows Directors 
who are unable to attend to submit views in advance of the meeting. The 
Group Secretary oversees the distribution of these papers and ensures 
that there is an appropriate level of communication between the Board 
and its committees and between senior management and the Non-
executive Directors. He also keeps the Board apprised of relevant 
developments in corporate governance.
Additionally, the Chief Executive will, as a matter of routine, provide a 
written update on important business issues between meetings and invite 
the views of the Directors on these.
Performance evaluation
In accordance with the provisions of the Code, the Board undertakes a 
formal and rigorous evaluation of its own performance and effectiveness 
and assesses the performance of its committees and individual Board 
members on an annual basis.
The Chairman is responsible for, and leads the evaluation process and is 
assisted by the Group Secretary. In line with best practice, and as it has 
done in previous years, the Company engaged an external facilitator for 
the Board evaluation exercise in 2011. EquityCommunications Ltd, an 
independent organisation which has aided the Company on corporate 
governance matters, once again performed this role.
As part of the evaluation process, the Chairman undertook a series of 
one-to-one meetings with each member of the Board and the Group 
Secretary to discuss their individual participation at and contribution to 
Board meetings. The Senior Independent Director, having taken soundings 
from all members of the Board and the Group Secretary, conducted the 
Chairman’s individual evaluation and provided feedback to the Chairman.
The external element of the Board review was completed using a 
questionnaire specifically designed for Cookson. This focused on the Board 
structure and functionality, and also covered the strategy review, 
succession planning and executive development. All the Directors and the 
Group Secretary completed the document, with the exception of Dr 
FitzGerald who had only been appointed the month before the external 
evaluation was undertaken. 
The results from the questionnaire were collated and summarised by the 
external facilitator.  Each Director received a copy of the report, which was 
discussed at the December meeting of the Board. The report summarised 
and analysed all responses to the questionnaire on a non-attributable 
basis. The Chairman used early feedback from the questionnaire process to 
assist in his interviews.
The report concluded that the initial positive reaction from the 2010 
evaluation to the appointment of the Chairman had been more than 
maintained in 2011. Similarly, the strong and united Board dynamic that 
previously existed, had been preserved and strengthened with the addition of 
the new appointee. The report also found that the refinement to the Board’s 
approach to risk evaluation and mitigation identified in the 2010 evaluation 
had been implemented and was regarded as a valuable supplement to the 
Group’s operations, not least given the heightened risk of recession in some 
world markets. The report found that the Board was pleased that 
management had taken swift and early action to ensure that the Group took 
appropriate steps to counter any potential downturn in its businesses. The 
greater attention to succession planning, also identified as a priority, had been 
undertaken — although the new evaluation exercise identified that there was 
more to address with senior management succession. 
Each Chairman of the Audit, Nominations and Remuneration Committees 
also discussed the performance of their committees.  These review 
discussions concluded that each committee continued to operate 
effectively and no changes to current procedures were necessary. 
The Board agreed a number of specific action items resulting from the 
evaluation exercise. These included: continuing the emphasis on 
succession planning, particularly for Non-executive Directors and senior 
management; increasing the focus on investor relations; continuing the 
focus on strategy development and providing more updates for the Board 
on the regulatory environment from external advisers.
Induction and training
The Group Secretary ensures that a comprehensive induction programme 
is provided to all new Directors, including visits to manufacturing facilities, 
meetings with key Group executives and introductions to the Company’s 
principal external advisers, as appropriate. New Directors are also advised 
of their legal and other duties and obligations as Directors of a listed 
company. This is supplemented by reference materials, which are updated 
as required, including information about the Board, its committees, 
Directors’ duties, procedures for dealing in the Company’s shares and 
other regulatory and governance matters. 
The Chairman meets with Directors on an ongoing basis to review any 
training and development needs. In addition, the Directors are provided 
with details of seminars and training courses relevant to their role. They 
are encouraged to attend these as they consider appropriate and are 
supported by the Company in so doing. Where a general training need is 
identified, in-house training is provided to the entire Board. In 2011 
training was given to the Board on the new Bribery Act and updates were 
given on developments in various areas of governance and regulation, 
including consultation on, and changes to, institutional and regulatory 
codes on diversity and remuneration. During the year, Directors also 
attended external seminars and other functions relevant to specific areas 
of their responsibility.
Relations with shareholders
The Company has an established investor relations programme managed by 
the Chief Executive and Group Finance Director. The Company reports its 
financial results to shareholders twice a year, with the publication of its Annual 
and Half-Yearly Financial Reports and issues two further trading updates each 
year with the publication of its Interim Management Statements. In 
conjunction with these announcements, presentations or teleconference calls 
are held with institutional investors and analysts. Recordings of these are 
made available on the Group’s website along with hard copies of any 
presentation materials issued — www.cooksongroup.co.uk.  20769-04  13/01/2012 Skeleton 2

Cookson Group plc  
Annual Report for the year ended 31 December 2011
The Company maintains a regular dialogue with institutional investors. The 
majority of meetings with investors are led by the Chief Executive and 
Group Finance Director, but the Chairman, Senior Independent Director 
and other Directors are also available to meet with significant shareholders 
as appropriate. The Senior Independent Director, as Chairman of the 
Remuneration Committee, meets with key institutional shareholders and 
their representative bodies each year to discuss the Company’s 
remuneration policy and practice. 
Regular updates on shareholder issues and discussions are provided to the 
Board. Board members also receive copies of significant analysts’ notes 
issued on the Company. All Directors normally attend the Company’s AGM, 
providing shareholders with the opportunity to question them about 
issues relating to the Group, either during the meeting or informally 
afterwards.
BOARD COMMITTEES
The principal committees of the Board are the Audit, Remuneration and 
Nominations Committees. Each committee has written terms of reference 
agreed by the Board. These are available to view on the Company’s

AUDIT COMMITTEE
Members
Jeff Hewitt (Committee Chairman) Jan Oosterveld
Emma FitzGerald 
(appointed 1 August 2011)
Barry Perry 
(retired 12 May 2011)
Peter Hill John Sussens
The Audit Committee members are the Non-executive Directors. The Audit 
Committee is chaired by Mr Hewitt, a qualified accountant. The Code 
requires the Board to be satisfied that at least one member of the 
Committee has recent and relevant financial experience. The Board 
considers that Mr Hewitt possesses the requisite financial experience to 
meet this requirement. The Board also considers that the Audit Committee 
members together possess the necessary commercial, financial and audit 
expertise to help them assess effectively the complex accounting, audit 
and risk issues they have to address. 
At the invitation of the Audit Committee Chairman, the Chairman, Chief 
Executive, Group Finance Director, CEO of the Engineered Ceramics 
Division, Group Financial Controller, Group Head of Internal Audit and the 
Company’s Auditor, KPMG Audit Plc, regularly attend meetings. Other 
executives are invited to attend as and when appropriate. The Audit 
Committee meets regularly with the Company’s Auditor and the Group 
Head of Internal Audit without any executives being present.
The Audit Committee operates under formal terms of reference that are 
reviewed on a regular basis. These terms of reference authorise the 
Committee to obtain outside legal or other independent professional 
advice at the cost of the Company and to secure the attendance at Audit 
Committee meetings of other parties with relevant experience and 
expertise should it be considered necessary. The Audit Committee did not 
feel it necessary to seek such outside advice in 2011. 
The Chairman of the Audit Committee reports the outcome of the Audit 
Committee meetings to the Board and all members of the Board receive 
the agenda, papers and minutes of Audit Committee meetings.
Role and Responsibilities
The primary role and responsibilities of the Audit Committee are:
	 ❯ monitoring the integrity of the Company’s Half-Year and Annual 
Financial Statements, the Interim Management Statements and any 
other formal announcements relating to the Company’s financial 
performance;
	 ❯ reviewing the process whereby the Board assesses the effectiveness of 
the Group’s internal controls and risk management systems;
	 ❯ establishing and reviewing procedures for detecting fraud, and systems 
and controls for the prevention of bribery, along with overseeing the 
Company’s arrangements for employees to raise concerns about 
possible wrongdoing in financial reporting or other matters;
	 ❯ monitoring and reviewing the effectiveness of the Company’s internal 
audit function;
	 ❯ monitoring and reviewing the Auditor’s independence, objectivity 
and effectiveness, taking into account professional and regulatory 
requirements;
	 ❯ making recommendations to the Board on the appointment and 
dismissal of the Auditor and approving the remuneration and terms of 
engagement of the Auditor; and
	 ❯ helping to strengthen the independent position of the Auditor by 
providing a direct channel of communication between it and the  
Non-executive Directors.
Activities
During the year under review, the Audit Committee met four times and 
reviewed, amongst other matters, the Company’s published financial 
results; internal audit reports and management control issues; the scope 
of the external audit and its cost-effectiveness; the performance of the 
Auditor; and the extent to which the Auditor’s remuneration for non-audit 
services might affect its independence and objectivity in carrying out the 
audit. 
In respect of all matters considered by the Audit Committee, it believes 
that it received sufficient, reliable and timely information from 
management and the Auditor to enable it to fulfil its responsibilities.

More specifically, the responsibilities of the Audit Committee were 
discharged as follows:
	 ❯ at its meetings in July 2011 and February 2012, the Audit Committee 
reviewed the Company’s Half-Yearly Report and Annual Results 
Announcement/Annual Report and Accounts, respectively. On both 
occasions, the Committee received reports from management on 
significant aspects of the Group’s financial statements, including 
matters requiring significant management judgement, asset 
impairment valuation, amounts reported at fair value, off-balance 
sheet items and contingent liabilities, and received reports from the 
Auditor identifying any accounting or judgemental issues thereon 
requiring its attention;
	 ❯ at each of the four meetings, the Audit Committee received a report 
from the Group Head of Internal Audit covering, amongst other 
things, the work undertaken by the internal audit function and 
management responses to proposals made in the audit reports issued 
by the function during the year. In addition, at the July 2011 meeting 
the Committee reviewed the results of an assessment which had been 
undertaken of the performance of the internal audit function and at 
the December 2011 meeting, the Committee reviewed and approved 
the internal audit plan, submitted by the Group Head of Internal Audit 
for 2012;
	 ❯ at each of the four meetings, if relevant, the Audit Committee 
reviewed the Auditor’s control findings;
	 ❯ at the July 2011 meeting, the Audit Committee reviewed the results of 
an assessment which had been undertaken of the performance of the 
Auditor, based upon feedback received from the Group’s corporate 
and divisional finance management. No significant problems were 
identified with the relationship and quality of audit by KPMG. Some 
areas of potential improvement were identified in relation to audit 
planning and the communication of audit findings to management. 
These items were taken into account in the implementation of the 
global audit plan for 2011.
	 ❯ also at the July meeting, the Audit Committee reviewed and agreed the 
audit plan presented by the Auditor, which detailed the approach and 
scope of the work to be undertaken and the level of fee to be charged; 
	 ❯ at its meetings in October 2011 and February 2012, the Audit 
Committee reviewed both the risk management process operated by 
management designed to identify the key risks facing each business 
and how those risks were being managed;
	 ❯ at its meeting in February 2012, the Audit Committee reviewed a report 
from management which addressed the appropriateness of the 
production of the Group and Company financial statements on a going 
concern basis; 
	 ❯ from time to time, executives were required to make presentations to 
the Audit Committee or to the full Board on the identification, 
management and control of specific areas of risk which impact the 
Company and the Group; and
	 ❯ as a matter of routine, the Audit Committee was presented with 
information on any significant litigation involving the Group.
Appointment of Auditor
The Audit Committee is responsible for making recommendations to the 
Board in relation to the appointment, reappointment and removal of the 
Auditor. In undertaking this duty, the Committee takes into consideration 
a number of factors concerning the Auditor and the Group’s current 
activity, including: 
	 ❯ the quality both of reports provided by the Auditor to the Audit 
Committee and the Board, and of advice given; 
	 ❯ the level of understanding demonstrated of the Group’s businesses;
	 ❯ the independence of the Auditor, in light of the provision of non-audit 
services; 
	 ❯ the objectivity of the Auditor’s views on the controls throughout the 
Group; 
	 ❯ its ability to coordinate a global audit, working to tight deadlines; 
	 ❯ the cost-competitiveness of the Auditor in relation to the audit costs 
of comparable UK companies; 
	 ❯ the tenure of the incumbent Auditor; and 
	 ❯ the periodic rotation of the senior audit management assigned to the 
audit of the Company.  
In addition, the Audit Committee considers external reviews of the 
performance and quality of the Auditor, including:
	 ❯ the annual report issued by the Audit Inspection Unit of the Financial 
Reporting Council on the work of the Auditor; and
	 ❯ the Auditor’s own annual Transparency Report. 
KPMG or its predecessor firms has a long-standing tenure as the 
Company’s Auditor, during which reviews of its performance and the 
rotation of the senior audit partner designated to the Company’s account 
have been regularly undertaken. Following the completion of his five year 
term, the Company’s current senior audit partner will be rotating off the 
account in 2012.
Having considered the aforementioned factors in 2011, the Audit 
Committee decided to recommend the Auditor for reappointment.
The terms on which the Auditor is engaged do not include any contractual 
obligations which would prevent the Directors appointing a different audit 
firm should this be considered appropriate.
Independence and objectivity of Auditor 
The Audit Committee is cognisant of the need to ensure that the 
independence and objectivity of the Auditor is continually maintained. It 
has put in place safeguards to ensure that the independence of the 
external audit is not compromised. These safeguards include:
	 ❯ seeking ongoing confirmation that the Auditor is independent of the 
Company in its own professional judgement; and
	 ❯ considering all the relationships between the Auditor and the Group, 
including those relating to the provision of non-audit services and 
whether these impair, or appear to impair, the Auditor’s judgement or 
independence. 20769-04  13/01/2012 Skeleton 2
26
Cookson Group plc  
Annual Report for the year ended 31 December 2011
The Audit Committee regularly monitors the other services being provided 
to the Group by the Auditor. The Company has a policy governing the 
Group-wide conduct of non-audit work by the Auditor to ensure that this 
does not impair its independence or objectivity. The Auditor is prohibited 
from performing services where it:
	 ❯ may be required to audit its own work;
	 ❯ would participate in activities that would normally be undertaken by 
management;
	 ❯ is remunerated through a “success fee” structure; or
	 ❯ acts in an advocacy role for the Group.
The policy sets out the categories of work that the Auditor is prohibited 
from undertaking. Other than these, the Company does not impose an 
automatic prohibition on the Auditor undertaking non-audit work. The 
Auditor is eligible for selection to provide non-audit services that are not, 
or are not perceived to be, in conflict with Auditor independence, 
provided it has the skill, competence and integrity to carry out the work in 
the best interests of the Group. 
An annual budget for non-audit related fees which the Group is proposing 
to pay to the Auditor, is presented for pre-approval to the Audit 
Committee each year. Any individual assignment where the fee is likely to 
be in excess of £50,000 must be pre-approved by the Audit Committee. 
Where appropriate, services are tendered prior to awarding work to the 
Auditor. Details of the amounts paid to the Auditor during the year for 
audit and other services are set out in note 6 on page 64. The majority of 
the non-audit related fees paid to the Auditor in 2011 related to tax 
consultancy advice in respect of a number of small projects, where its 
knowledge of the business made it effective and cost-efficient for the 
Auditor to undertake the work.
Internal audit
The Group’s internal audit function operates on a global basis. The Group 
Head of Internal Audit is responsible for developing the function, within 
the framework of common Group policies and standards, and for carrying 
out assignments in accordance with an annual audit plan approved by the 
Audit Committee. In 2011, 83 audit assignments were undertaken 
covering 70 businesses. The Group Head of Internal Audit reports directly 
to the Audit Committee Chairman. The Audit Committee receives reports 
from the Group Head of Internal Audit on a regular basis and reports to 
the Board on the results of its review. 
Employee business concern helpline 
The Audit Committee has established procedures for the receipt, retention 
and treatment of complaints received by the Company including 
accounting, internal controls, auditing matters, harassment and 
confidential communications from employees. The helpline is operated 24 
hours a day, seven days a week, by an organisation that specialises in the 
provision of such services. It can be contacted by phone, email or via a 
designated website. Translation facilities are available for those for whom 
English is not their first or preferred language.
 
Approach to anti-corruption and bribery training 
In response to the UK Bribery Act, the Company’s Code of Conduct was 
revised and recommunicated to all employees in 2011. New policies on 
anti-bribery & corruption have been developed. Together they require that 
employees and others working on behalf of the Company do not engage 
in any form of bribery or corruption. 
An anti-bribery and corruption compliance programme has been 
established throughout the Group, and is being implemented through a 
targeted face-to-face training programme. An e-learning module has been 
developed and is being rolled out globally, as local language versions 
become available, to relevant office-based individuals in 2012. New 
employees, as relevant, will go through the training as part of their 
induction process. 
The compliance programme includes undertaking risk assessments and 
engaging with others working on behalf of the Company to ensure that 
their standards comply with Cookson’s policies. 
Cookson is a member of the corporate supporters forum of Transparency 
International UK. 
Executive compensation and risk
All the Non-executive Directors serve on both the Audit and Remuneration 
Committees. They are therefore able to bring their experience and 
knowledge of the activities of each Committee to bear when considering 
the critical judgements of the other. This means that the Directors are in a 
position to consider carefully the impact of incentive arrangements on the 
Group’s risk profile and to ensure the Group’s remuneration policy and 
programme is structured so as to accord with the long-term objectives 
and risk appetite of the Company. 
RISK MANAGEMENT AND INTERNAL CONTROL
The Board has overall responsibility for the establishment and 
maintenance of the Group’s system of risk management and internal 
control, and for reviewing its effectiveness. This system is designed to 
manage, rather than eliminate, the risks facing the Group and safeguard 
assets. No system of internal control can provide absolute assurance 
against material misstatement or loss. The Group’s system is designed to 
provide the Directors with reasonable assurance that problems are 
identified on a timely basis and are dealt with appropriately. In accordance 
with the provisions of the Code, the Directors confirm that they have 
reviewed the effectiveness of the Group’s system of internal control and 
that the necessary actions have been taken to remedy and control any 
control weaknesses identified during the year. Since the date of this review 
there have been no significant changes in internal controls or other 
matters which could significantly affect them.
The Audit Committee assists the Board in reviewing the effectiveness of 
the Group’s system of internal controls, including financial, operational 
and compliance controls, and risk management systems. The key features 
of the Group’s system of internal controls include:

Strategy and financial reporting
The Group operates a comprehensive strategic planning and forecasting 
process, with an annual budget approved by the Board. Monthly operating 
financial information is reported against this budget and key trends and 
variances analysed. Action is then taken as appropriate. 
Group accounting policies and procedures are formulated and 
disseminated to all Group operations, covering the application of 
accounting standards and the maintenance of accounting records and key 
financial control procedures. 
Operational controls 
Each operating company, including the Divisional and Corporate offices, 
maintains internal controls and procedures appropriate to its structure and 
business environment, whilst complying with Group policies on items such 
as the authorisation of capital expenditure, treasury transactions and the 
management of intellectual property. 
In addition, the Group’s financial reporting process, including the 
preparation of the Company’s consolidated financial statements, 
incorporates the dissemination and use of common accounting policies and 
procedures and financial reporting software. 
The Board considers significant financing and investment decisions 
concerning the Group, including the giving of guarantees and indemnities, 
and monitors policy and control mechanisms for managing treasury risk. 
Risk assessment and management
There is a continuous process for identifying, evaluating and managing 
any significant risks faced by Cookson. Group management operates a risk 
management process designed to identify the key risks facing each 
business and reports to the Board on how those risks are being managed. 
As a basis for this report, each of the Group’s major business units 
produces a “risk map” which identifies their key risks and assesses the 
likelihood of those risks occurring, their impact if they do occur and the 
actions being taken to manage those risks to a desired level. 
The Board reviews the role of insurance and other measures used in 
managing risks across the Group, receives regular reports on any major 
issues that have arisen during the year and makes an annual assessment of 
how the risks have changed over the period under review.
Reviewing the effectiveness of internal controls
The internal control system is monitored and supported by the Group’s 
internal audit function. This function assists management and the Board in 
the effective discharge of their responsibility for internal control by 
conducting reviews of Cookson businesses and reporting objectively both 
on the adequacy and effectiveness of the system of internal control in 
place and as to whether those businesses are in compliance with 
applicable Group policies and procedures. The Audit Committee receives 
reports from the Group Head of Internal Audit on a regular basis and 
reports to the Board on the results of its review. 
As part of the Board’s process for reviewing the effectiveness of the system 
of internal control, it delegates the following matters to the Audit 
Committee to be carried out during the year: 
	 ❯ review of external and internal audit work plans; 
	 ❯ consideration of reports from management, internal audit and 
external audit on the system of internal control and any significant 
control weaknesses; and 
	 ❯ discussions with management on the actions taken on problem areas 
identified by Board members, in internal audit reports or in external 
audit management letters. 
At the year-end, following the review by the Audit Committee of internal 
financial controls and of the processes covering other controls, the Board 
evaluates the results of the internal control and risk management 
procedures conducted by senior management. This includes a self-
certification exercise by which senior financial and operational 
management throughout the Group certify the effectiveness of the system 
of internal controls within the businesses for which they are responsible, 
together with their compliance throughout the year with the Group’s 
policies and procedures.

Members
John Sussens (Committee Chairman) Peter Hill 
Emma FitzGerald 
(appointed 1 August 2011)
Jan Oosterveld
Barry Perry
Jeff Hewitt (retired 12 May 2011)
The Remuneration Committee members are the Non-executive Directors. 
The Committee’s principal roles are to set the appropriate remuneration 
for the Chairman, the executive Directors and the Group Secretary, and to 
recommend and monitor the level and structure of remuneration for 
senior management, being the first layer of management below Board 
level. Further details of the activities of the Remuneration Committee are 
provided in the Directors’ Remuneration Report on pages 37 to 49.
The Chairman of the Remuneration Committee reports the outcome of 
Committee meetings to the Board. 
NOMINATIONS COMMITTEE
Members
Jeff Harris (Committee Chairman), Nick Salmon and any three Non-
executive Directors.
The Nominations Committee advises the Board on appointments to, and 
retirements and resignations from, the Board, and reviews the Company’s 
succession plans. The members of the Nominations Committee are the 
Chairman, the Chief Executive and any three Non-executive Directors. The 
Committee meets as and when required and is chaired by the Chairman or 
a Non-executive Director. The Chairman would not act as chairman of the 
Nominations Committee where it was dealing with the appointment of his 
successor. Formal meetings are held to consider standing items of 
business; there is also a significant level of ad hoc discussion between 
members of the Nominations Committee, particularly when a recruitment 
exercise is taking place. 20769-04  13/01/2012 Skeleton 2

Cookson Group plc  
Annual Report for the year ended 31 December 2011
During 2011, the Nominations Committee was active in the recruitment of 
a new Non-executive Director. When considering the appointment of new 
Directors, the Nominations Committee draws up a specification, taking 
into consideration the diversity of the Board including the balance of skills, 
knowledge and experience, the independence of Board members and the 
ongoing requirements of the Group. The Nominations Committee’s 
foremost priority is to ensure that Cookson continues to have the best 
possible leadership. Its prime responsibility is the strength of the Board. 
Board appointments are made on merit against objective criteria, 
selecting the best candidate for the post. The Nominations Committee 
utilises the services of executive search firms to identify appropriate 
candidates and will only use those firms that have adopted the Voluntary 
Code of Conduct addressing gender diversity and best practice in search 
assignments. Wherever possible, the Nominations Committee arranges for 
all Directors to meet with the preferred candidate. The Nominations 
Committee makes recommendations for each appointment to the full 
Board. Care is taken to ensure that all proposed appointees have sufficient 
time available to devote to the role and do not have any conflicts of 
interest.
The Nominations Committee reviews the Company’s succession plans for 
members of the Board. The Board as a whole also considers this subject. 
Each of Cookson’s divisions submits detailed succession plans in respect of 
senior divisional executives to the Board for review each year. The Board 
also considers succession planning for senior Corporate executives.
The Board actively seeks to meet with key executives throughout the 
Group so as to gain a greater understanding of the breadth and depth of 
management talent. This enables members of the Committee to adopt a 
more informed approach to succession planning.
The Chairman of the Nominations Committee reports the outcome of the 
Nominations Committee meetings to the Board.
FINANCE AND SHARE SCHEMES COMMITTEES
The Board delegates certain responsibilities on an ad hoc basis to the 
Finance and Share Schemes committees.
The Finance Committee is chaired by the Chairman, its other members 
being the Chief Executive, Group Finance Director and Group Treasurer. 
The Committee meets as and when required to consider the approval of 
treasury-related matters.
The Share Schemes Committee’s membership consists of any two 
Directors. It meets as and when required to undertake administrative 
matters in relation to the Company’s share schemes.
CENTRAL EXECUTIVE
In addition to the committees of the Board described above, specific 
authority has been delegated to the Central Executive comprising the 
Chief Executive, Group Finance Director and Group Secretary. The Central 
Executive is responsible for reviewing and approving capital expenditure, 
and acquisitions and disposals at certain levels as determined by the 
Board. Responsibility for day-to-day operational management rests with 
the divisional Chief Executives.

PRINCIPAL RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES
As described in the Corporate Governance Report, there is a continuous process for identifying, evaluating and managing significant risks faced by 
Cookson. Group management operates a risk management process designed to identify the key risks facing each business and reports to the Audit 
Committee on the process of how those risks are being managed. The Board is responsible for the Group’s risk management and also reviews the role of 
insurance and other measures used in managing risks across the Group. The Board receives regular reports on any major issues that have arisen during 
the year and makes an annual assessment of how the risks have changed over the period under review.
Throughout its global operations, Cookson faces various risks, both internal and external, which could have a material impact on the Group’s long-term 
performance. Cookson manages the risks inherent in its operations in order to mitigate exposure to all forms of risk, where practical, and to transfer risk to 
insurers, where cost-effective. The risks below are not the only ones that the Group will face. Some risks are not yet known and some that are not currently 
deemed material could later become material. All of these risks could materially affect the Group, its businesses, results of future operations or financial 
condition.
RISK AND IMPACT MITIGATION
The financial performance and financial position of Cookson may be 
adversely affected by a significant weakening in demand in its core 
end-markets.
End-market conditions, and the Group’s trading performance, improved 
markedly during the first half of 2011, reflecting the continuation of the 
recovery from the economic downturn which started in the fourth quarter 
of 2008 and persisted through much of 2009. Whilst the recovery has been 
strong, end-markets (and revenue) for a number of our businesses is still not 
yet back to pre-crisis levels. However, since midsummer 2011, concerns 
about the world economy have intensified with growing evidence of a 
slowdown both in the economies of the developed and developing world. 
Whilst fears of a “double-dip” recession in the US and a “hard landing” in 
China seem to have abated in recent months, market commentators are still 
concerned about slowing global growth rates generally (including in China) 
and the likelihood of low, or possibly, negative growth in Europe. In addition 
to clear evidence of slowing worldwide economic growth, concerns about 
the stability of the Eurozone and the European financial/banking system 
have not totally receded. It is as yet unclear to what extent the seeming 
insolvency of Greece and the fiscal weakness of other countries such as 
Ireland, Spain, Italy and Portugal will impact the euro currency and the 
banking system. Whilst, for now, a liquidity squeeze in the banking system 
seems to have been avoided, there can be no certainty that this risk will not 
return. This is concerning given that this was the catalyst for the severe 
downturn in the “real” economy in late 2008/early 2009. 
Cookson’s divisions supply predominantly consumable products, on short 
lead times, to the global steel, foundry, electronics and precious metals 
industries. As such the Group’s expectations of future trading are based 
upon the Directors’ assessment of end-market conditions, which 
conditions are subject to some uncertainty. In the event that end-market 
conditions suffer further significant deterioration, Cookson may 
experience further reductions in trading activity, a lower share price, the 
financial failure of one or more of its key customers and suppliers, asset 
impairments, lower profitability and a material adverse impact on its 
financial position.
 
 
The Board regularly reviews Group strategy, which determines the 
markets in which the Group operates. The current spread of the Group’s 
major businesses, both geographically and by end-market served, 
provides some protection to the Group should conditions, in particular 
markets, deteriorate. Further, the reduction in the Group’s cost base 
during the last three years provides additional insulation to the adverse 
impact of any near-term market downturn. Also, in view of the extent of 
the de-stocking which took place during 2009 in the Group’s end-markets, 
the Directors believe that any downturn in its end-markets is likely to be 
less severe than that experienced in 2009. Following the cost-reduction 
initiatives and equity raising successfully completed during 2009 and the 
debt refinancing recently completed in 2010 and 2011, the Directors 
believe that the Group is well positioned financially to sustain a further 
downturn in end-market activity should this occur.  20769-04  13/01/2012 Skeleton 2

Annual Report for the year ended 31 December 2011
RISK AND IMPACT MITIGATION
The Group’s financial position and trading results may be adversely 
affected by fluctuations in exchange rates, interest rates or the rate of 
inflation.
The Group has no control over changes in foreign currency exchange 
rates, or inflation and interest rates. In the normal course of business, 
many transactions are carried out by Group businesses in currencies other 
than their reporting currency, leading to transactional foreign exchange 
risk, although this is not material for the Group overall. The Group is 
exposed to the effect of translating the results and net assets of its 
overseas subsidiaries into sterling. Significant fluctuations in the value of 
currencies in which it operates, in interest rates, or in rates of inflation may 
adversely impact the Group’s financial position, results of operations and 
ability to comply with its financial covenants.
 
 
The Group attempts to manage transactional and balance sheet 
translation risks associated with currency exchange rate fluctuations 
through its hedging and funding policies and it is Group policy that 
foreign currency transaction exposures that are material at an individual 
operating unit level are hedged using appropriate instruments such as 
forward foreign exchange contracts. For its key operating currencies, the 
Group broadly matches the currency profile of its borrowings with the 
currencies of its asset base, but does not hedge translational impact on 
the income statements of overseas subsidiaries. Where appropriate, the 
Group manages its interest rate exposures using interest rate swaps or 
other instruments.
The Group may lose customers to competitors with new or alternative 
technologies if its businesses either do not adequately adapt to market 
developments or are unable to protect, maintain and enforce their 
intellectual property.
The markets in which many of the Group’s businesses operate can 
experience rapid changes due to the introduction of new technologies. The 
Group’s continued success depends upon its ability to continue to develop 
and produce new and enhanced products and services on a cost-effective 
and timely basis in accordance with customer demands. If the Group fails to 
adequately adapt to market developments related to new products and 
technology, it could lose customers to suppliers with better or less costly 
products. Throughout its operations, the Group relies on a combination of 
trade secrets, patents, confidentiality procedures and agreements, and 
copyright and trade mark laws to protect its proprietary rights. If the Group 
fails to or is unable to protect, maintain and enforce its existing intellectual 
property, this may result in the loss of the Group’s exclusive right to use 
technologies and processes which are included or used in its businesses. In 
addition, the laws of certain foreign countries in which the Group operates 
may not protect proprietary rights to the same extent as those of, for 
example, the UK or the US.
 
 
 
Cookson invests significant amounts in research and development and 
endeavours to sustain its competitive advantage and take appropriate 
action to ensure that its cost base remains competitive. In 2011, total 
research and development spend was £42.1m, equivalent to 1.9% of net 
sales value.
The Group applies for patents over its major products, technologies and 
processes in a number of jurisdictions, including in Europe and the US. 
New product and service offerings by competitors are regularly monitored 
and any perceived breach of a Group patent is vigorously challenged. To 
the extent possible, the Group avoids holding key intellectual property in 
countries which do not afford an acceptable degree of legal protection to 
the Group.
The Group’s financial condition may be materially adversely affected by 
any significant liabilities for any defects of its products or services.
If a product of the Group or of one of the Group’s industrial customers 
does not conform to agreed specifications or is otherwise defective, the 
Group may be subject to claims by its customers arising from end-product 
defects, injury to individuals or other such claims. Legal claims have been 
brought against certain Group companies by third parties alleging that 
persons have been harmed by exposure to hazardous materials used by 
those companies in the manufacture of industrial and consumer products, 
and further claims may be brought in the future. Certain of the Group’s 
subsidiaries are subject to suits, predominantly in the US, relating to a 
small number of products containing asbestos manufactured prior to the 
acquisition of those subsidiaries by the Group. These suits usually also 
name many other product manufacturers. To date, the Group is not aware 
of there being any liability verdicts against any of these subsidiaries.
 
The Board believes that, taking into account legal advice received, the 
Group’s insurance arrangements, indemnification provided by former 
owners of certain of the subsidiaries impacted and financial provisions, 
none of the currently pending or potential claims will, either individually 
or in the aggregate, have a material adverse impact on the Group’s 
financial position and results of operations.

RISK AND IMPACT MITIGATION
The Group’s worldwide operations and businesses may be adversely 
affected by various political, legal, regulatory and other developments 
in countries in which it operates.
The Group is subject to various legal and regulatory regimes, including 
those covering taxation and environmental matters; and political risks 
including the imposition of trade barriers, changes of regulatory 
requirements, lack of protection for intellectual property rights and the 
volatility of input costs, selling prices, taxes and currencies. In particular, 
operating within the rapidly evolving developing nations can expose the 
Group’s businesses to significant local risks and challenges. Future global 
political, legal or regulatory developments concerning Group businesses 
may affect their ability to operate and to operate profitably in the affected 
jurisdictions. Should Group businesses fail to comply with applicable legal 
and regulatory requirements, this may result in a financial loss or 
restriction on their ability to operate.
The Group’s businesses are subject to a variety of operational risks, 
including natural catastrophe, terrorist action, theft, fraud and, particularly 
in developing nations, insufficient supply of high-quality local 
management and technical personnel. If any of the operational risks 
materialise to a significant extent, this could result in a substantial 
interruption to a facility, loss of future insurance cover, a potential loss of 
customers and revenue and financial loss.
 
 
As part of its planning process before entering a new market or territory, 
or expanding in an existing market or territory, the Group undertakes a 
rigorous assessment of the risks involved. In addition, the spread of the 
Group’s major businesses, both geographically and by end-market served, 
provides some protection to the Group should any of its businesses be 
adversely impacted by legal, regulatory or other changes in an individual 
market or territory.
The Group has in place an insurance programme covering all of its 
businesses which provides an acceptable level of coverage for the 
operational risks which they face. 
A withdrawal or reduction of precious metal consignment 
arrangements, or increased precious metal prices resulting in 
consignment lines being fully utilised, may cause a shortage of raw 
materials requiring the business to be restructured and downsized and 
may result in a short-term material increase in the Group’s financial 
indebtedness.
The Group’s precious metal fabrication operations utilise significant 
quantities of precious metals, primarily gold by value. These metals are 
held predominantly on consignment under contractual arrangements 
whereby the consignor retains title to the metal and the associated risks 
and benefits of ownership, with the result that the physical metal so held 
is not recorded in the Group balance sheet. These arrangements are 
uncommitted in that the consignor has the right, with limited or in some 
cases no notice, to demand physical return or purchase of its consigned 
metal. The utilisation of consigned precious metals is established practice 
in the precious metals industry. Should precious metals consignors decide 
to reduce or withdraw the facilities for whatever reason, or require a 
return of the consigned metal, or increased metal prices lead to the 
consignment arrangements becoming fully utilised, the Group’s precious 
metal fabrication operations may suffer shortages of raw materials 
requiring the business to be restructured and downsized in order to be 
able to operate within its available consignment facilities. In the 
short-term this may require precious metals to be purchased, which could 
materially increase the Group’s financial indebtedness pending 
completion of the downsizing.
 
 
 
 
 
Cookson has successfully maintained precious metal consignment 
arrangements of this nature for over 20 years. The Group has close 
commercial relationships with its group of consignor banks. Management 
seeks to operate the business at all times with appropriate headroom 
within the consignment facilities, taking account of anticipated levels of 
business activity and precious metals prices. 20769-04  13/01/2012 Skeleton 2

events and circumstances can cause results and developments to differ 
materially from those anticipated. The forward-looking statements reflect 
knowledge and information available at the date of preparation of this 
Annual Report and the Company undertakes no obligation to update 
these forward-looking statements. Nothing in this Annual Report should 
be construed as a profit forecast.
PRINCIPAL ACTIVITIES

BUSINESS REVIEW
As required by the Companies Act 2006, the Company must provide a fair 
review of the development and performance of the Group during 2011, its 
financial position at the end of the year and likely future developments in 
the Group’s business, together with information on environmental matters 
and employees and a description of the principal risks and uncertainties 
facing the Group. The information which satisfies these requirements is to 
be found in the Chief Executive’s Statement on pages 5 to 7; the Operating 
Review on pages 11 to 16; the Financial Review on pages 17 to 20; the 
Corporate Social Responsibility report on pages 8 to 10; the Business 
Model and Strategy on page 2; the Key Performance Indicators on page 3; 
this Directors’ Report on pages 32 to 36; the Corporate Governance Report 
on pages 22 to 28; and the Principal Risks and Uncertainties section on 
pages 29 to 31.
GOING CONCERN
Information on the business environment in which the Group operates, 
including the factors that are likely to impact the future prospects of the 
Group, is included in the Chief Executive’s Statement and the Operating 
Review. The principal risks and uncertainties that the Group faces 
throughout its global operations are shown on pages 29 to 31. The financial 
position of the Group, its cash flows, liquidity position and debt facilities are 
described in the Financial Review. In addition, note 27 to the consolidated 
financial statements sets out the Group’s objectives, policies and processes 
for managing its capital; financial risks; financial instruments and hedging 
activities; and its exposures to credit, market (both currency and interest 
rate-related) and liquidity risk. Further details of the Group’s cash balances 
and borrowings are included in notes 14, 15 and 27 to the consolidated 
financial statements.
The Directors have prepared cash flow forecasts for the Group for a period 
in excess of 12 months from the date of approval of the 2011 financial 
statements. These forecasts reflect an assessment of current and future 
end-market conditions and their impact on the Group’s future trading 
performance. The forecasts completed on this basis show that the Group 
will be able to operate within the current committed debt facilities and 
show continued compliance with the Company’s financial covenants. On 
the basis of the exercise described above and the Group’s available 
committed debt facilities, the Directors consider that the Group and 
Company have adequate resources to continue in operational existence 
for the forseeable future. Accordingly, they continue to adopt a going 
concern basis in preparing the financial statements of the Group and the 
Company.
DIVIDENDS
The Board is recommending a final dividend in respect of 2011 of  
14.50p (2010: 11.50p) per ordinary share which, if approved, will be paid 
on 11 June 2012 to shareholders on the register at 4 May 2012. An interim 
dividend of 7.25p per ordinary shares was paid on 17 October 2011 to 
shareholders on the register at 16 September 2011, making total dividends 
of 21.75p per ordinary share for the year (2010: 11.50p). No interim 
dividend was declared for 2010. 
ACCOUNTABILITY AND AUDIT
A responsibility statement of the Directors and a statement by the Auditor 
about its reporting responsibilities can be found on pages 50 and 51 
respectively. The Directors fulfil the responsibilities set out in their 
statement within the context of an overall control environment of central 
strategic direction and decentralised operating responsibility.
DISCLOSURE OF INFORMATION TO THE AUDITOR
As at the date of this report, so far as each Director of the Company is 
aware, there is no relevant audit information of which the Company’s 
Auditor is unaware and each Director hereby confirms that they have 
taken all the steps that they ought to have taken as a Director in order to 
make themselves aware of any relevant audit information and to establish 
that the Company’s Auditor is aware of that information. 20769-04  13/01/2012 Skeleton 2

AUDITOR
Resolutions for the reappointment of KPMG Audit Plc as Auditor of the 
Company and to authorise the Directors to determine its remuneration are 
to be proposed at the AGM.
REMUNERATION MATTERS
The Directors’ Remuneration Report appears on pages 37 to 49. None of 
the executive Directors’ contracts contains any change of control 
provisions.
REMUNERATION OF THE CHAIRMAN AND NON-EXECUTIVE 
DIRECTORS
The Board considers the remuneration policy for the Non-executive 
Directors. Non-executive Directors’ fees have not been increased during 
the year and remain at £40,000 per annum. A supplementary fee is 
payable to the Chairman of the Audit Committee of £15,000 per annum 
and the Chairman of the Remuneration Committee receives a 
supplementary fee of £10,000 per annum. A supplementary fee of £5,000 
per annum is also payable to the Senior Independent Director. No changes 
were made in 2011 to the supplementary fees payable. 
The Chairman is paid a fee of £164,000 per annum. The Chairman’s 
remuneration, which is subject to periodic review, is determined by the 
Remuneration Committee. There has been no change to the Chairman’s 
remuneration since his appointment to the role in May 2010. Neither the 
Chairman, who is not an executive Director, nor the other Non-executive 
Directors are members of the Group’s pension plans, nor do they 
participate in the Group’s incentive schemes.
DIRECTORS
Dr FitzGerald and Messrs Butterworth, Harris, Hewitt, Hill, Oosterveld, 
Perry, Salmon, Sussens and Wanecq all served as Directors of the Company 
during the year. Mr Perry retired from the Board at the close of the AGM on 
12 May 2011 and Dr FitzGerald was appointed as a Director on 1 August 
2011. Biographical information for all the current Directors of the 
Company is given on page 21. All the Directors will retire at the AGM and 
offer themselves for election. Further information on the contractual 
arrangements of the executive Directors is given on page 46. The 
Non-executive Directors do not have service agreements.
LEGAL MATTERS
All Directors have access to the advice and services of the Group Secretary. 
There is also an agreed procedure in place for Directors, in the furtherance 
of their duties, to take independent legal advice if necessary, at the 
Company’s expense.
DIRECTORS’ INDEMNITIES
To the extent permitted by section 236 of the Companies Act 2006, the 
Directors have been granted Qualifying Third Party Indemnity Provisions 
by the Company and the directors of the Group’s UK Pension Plan Trustee 
Board (none of whom are Directors of Cookson Group plc) have been 
granted Qualifying Pension Scheme Indemnity Provisions by Cookson 
Pension Plans Trustees Ltd. These indemnities were in force throughout 
the last financial year and remain in force.
DIRECTORS’ CONFLICTS OF INTEREST
Provisions in the Company’s Articles of Association permit the Board to 
consider and, if thought fit, to authorise situations where a Director has an 
interest that conflicts, or may possibly conflict, with the interests of the 
Company (“Situational Conflicts”). The Board has established a formal 
system for Directors to declare Situational Conflicts so that they can be 
considered for authorisation by the remaining members of the Board. In 
deciding whether to authorise a Situational Conflict, the non-conflicted 
Directors are required to act in the way they consider would be most likely 
to promote the success of the Company, and they may impose limits or 
conditions when giving authorisation or subsequently if they think this is 
appropriate. The Group Secretary minutes the consideration of any conflict 
and records any authorisations granted. The Board believes that the 
systems it has in place for reporting Situational Conflicts continue to 
operate effectively.
EMPLOYMENT POLICIES
A fundamental concept embodied in the Company’s Code of Conduct is 
that Cookson’s goals can only be met through the efforts of its employees. 
Cookson recognises that job satisfaction requires working environments 
that motivate employees to be productive and innovative and provide 
opportunities for employee training and development to maximise 
personal potential and develop careers within the Group. Cookson is 
managed on a decentralised basis and within each division it is the 
responsibility of the relevant divisional Chief Executive to adopt 
employment policies and practices that best suit the size, style and 
geographical location of their operations. This management structure 
allows the Group’s operations to respond competitively to changes in the 
marketplace and to develop and retain a strong sense of identity, whilst 
benefiting from being a part of a major international group. 
Cookson values the involvement of its employees and keeps them 
informed on matters affecting them as employees and factors relevant to 
Group performance. It is established policy throughout Cookson that 
decisions on recruitment, career development, training, promotion and 
other employment-related issues are made solely on the grounds of 
individual ability, achievement, expertise and conduct. These principles 
are operated on a non-discriminatory basis. Cookson gives full and fair 
consideration to applications for employment from disabled persons. 
Should an employee become disabled during their employment with 
Cookson, every effort is made to enable them to continue their service 
with the Group. 20769-04  13/01/2012 Skeleton 2

Cookson Group plc  
Annual Report for the year ended 31 December 2011
PENSIONS
In each country in which the Group operates, the pension arrangements in 
place are considered to be consistent with good employment practice in 
that particular area. Independent advisers are used to ensure that the 
plans are operated in accordance with local legislation and the rules of 
each plan. Group policy prohibits direct investment of pension fund assets 
in the Company’s shares. Outside the UK, the US, Germany and Belgium, 
the majority of pension plans in the Group are of a defined contribution 
nature.
The Group’s UK defined benefits plan (the “UK Plan”) and the main US 
defined benefits plan are closed to new entrants and have ceased 
providing future benefits accrual, with all eligible employees instead being 
provided with benefits through defined contribution arrangements.
For the Group’s closed UK Plan a Trustee Board exists comprising 
employees, former employees and an independent trustee. The Board 
currently comprises seven trustee directors, of whom three are member 
nominated. The administration of the plan is outsourced. The Company is 
mindful of its obligations under the Pensions Act 2004 and of the need to 
comply with the guidance issued by the Pensions Regulator. Regular 
dialogue is maintained between the Company and the Trustee Board of 
the UK Plan to ensure that both Company and Trustee are apprised of the 
same financial and other information about the Group and the UK Plan. 
This is pertinent to each being able to contribute to the effective 
functioning of the UK Plan. The Company currently has in place a schedule 
of contributions, agreed with the Trustee Board, which aims to reduce to 
zero the deficit existing on the UK Plan as at 31 December 2009 by 
February 2016. The adequacy of this schedule of contributions will be 
monitored over time, so as to assess the need for it to be modified in the 
light of changes in the deficit position.
Current active employees in the UK are offered membership of a defined 
contribution plan, which is operated on a contract basis, with oversight by 
a governance committee.
All US retirement plan assets are held in trust for the exclusive benefit of 
plan participants and their beneficiaries. An independent financial 
institution acts as the Trustee. The trust assets are protected by law and by 
Federal Government Regulation and are subject to annual audit by an 
independent accountant, the Internal Revenue Service and the 
Department of Labor. Further details of pension arrangements are given in 
note 28.
DONATIONS
Donations of the Company in the UK for charitable purposes each totalled 
£nil (2010: £nil). In accordance with Company policy, no political donations 
were made in either 2011 or 2010.
CREDITOR PAYMENT POLICY
Each operating company in the Group is responsible for agreeing the 
terms and conditions under which business transactions with their 
suppliers are conducted. It is Group policy that payments to suppliers are 
made in accordance with these terms, provided that the supplier is also 
complying with all relevant terms and conditions.
In the accounts of the Company as at 31 December 2011, the number of 
days’ purchases outstanding was 21 (2010: 18 days).
ESSENTIAL CONTRACTS OR ARRANGEMENTS WITH CUSTOMERS, 
CONTRACTORS AND SUPPLIERS
The Company is required to disclose any contractual or other 
arrangements with customers, contractors and suppliers which it 
considers are essential to its business. The Company has a number of 
contractual arrangements in support of its business activities. Whilst the 
loss of some of these arrangements may cause temporary disruption, none 
is considered to be essential in the context of Cookson’s business as a 
whole. 
CHANGE OF CONTROL PROVISIONS
The terms of the Group’s committed bank facility and US Private 
Placement Loan Notes contain provisions entitling the counterparties to 
exercise termination or other rights in the event of a change of control on 
takeover of the Company. A number of other arrangements to which the 
Company and its subsidiaries are party, such as other debt arrangements 
and share incentive plans, may alter or terminate on a change of control in 
the event of a takeover. In the context of the Group as a whole, these other 
arrangements are not considered to be significant. 
SHARE CAPITAL
As at the date of this report, the Company had an issued share capital of 
276,438,067 ordinary shares of £1 each, being the total number of 
Cookson Group plc shares with voting rights. The Company currently has 
only one class of shares.
Further information relating to the Company’s issued share capital can be 
found in note 9 to the Company financial statements.
The Company operates a number of share-based incentive plans (further 
details about these are given in the Directors’ Remuneration Report). For 
the majority of these plans the Company can satisfy entitlements either by 
the acquisition of existing shares or by the issue of new shares. Existing 
shares are held in an employee share ownership trust (“ESOP”). The trustee 
of the ESOP purchases shares in the open market as required, to enable 
the Company to meet liabilities for the provision of existing shares to 
satisfy awards that vest. The trustee does not register votes in respect of 
these shares and has waived the right to receive any dividends.
In 2011 the Trustee purchased 1.2m £1 ordinary shares in the Company 
with a nominal value of £1.2m at a cash cost of £7.8m to satisfy the actual 
and potential vesting of awards under the Group’s share-based payment 
plans (see note 10 to the Company financial statements).

Adjustments were made to outstanding share-based incentives as 
appropriate following the rights issue in 2009, including to the number of 
shares granted under options and awards and to the exercise price, if any, 
of those options and awards, and any relevant performance conditions. 
Such adjustments were made in accordance with the rules of the relevant 
plan and, where required by the relevant plan rules, adjustments were 
made with the prior approval of HM Revenue & Customs and/or the 
Company’s Auditor. No ordinary shares have been issued since the 
year-end in relation to the exercise of options granted under the 
Company’s share option schemes. Resolutions giving the Directors the 
authority to allot further shares and make allotments of shares to persons 
other than existing shareholders in certain circumstances will again be 
proposed at the AGM.
ADDITIONAL INFORMATION FOR SHAREHOLDERS
Set out below is a summary of certain provisions of the Company’s current 
Articles of Association (“Articles”) and applicable English law concerning 
companies (the Companies Act 2006, the “Companies Act”). This is a 
summary only and the relevant provisions of the Articles or the Companies 
Act should be consulted if further information is required.
AUTHORITY FOR PURCHASE OF OWN SHARES
Subject to the provisions of Company law and any other applicable 
regulations, the Company may purchase its own shares. At the 2011 AGM, 
shareholders gave the Company renewed authority to make market 
purchases of up to a maximum of 10% at that time of the Company’s 
issued ordinary share capital. As at the date of this report, the Company 
has made no such purchases under this authority. The Directors believe it 
advisable to seek renewal of this authority at each AGM. The Company’s 
Articles specify that, subject to the authorisation of an appropriate 
resolution passed by a general meeting of the Company, Directors can 
allot relevant securities under Section 551 of the Companies Act, up to the 
aggregate nominal amount specified by that Act. In addition, the Articles 
state that the Directors can seek the authority of shareholders in general 
meeting to allot equity securities for cash without first being required to 
offer such shares to existing ordinary shareholders in proportion to their 
existing holdings in connection with a rights issue and in other 
circumstances up to an aggregate nominal amount as specified in Section 
561 of the Companies Act.
TRANSFER OF SHARES
All transfers of shares which are in certificated form may be effected by 
transfer in writing in any usual or common form or in any other form 
acceptable to the Directors and may be under hand only. The instrument 
of transfer shall be signed by or on behalf of the transferor and (except in 
the case of fully paid shares) by or on behalf of the transferee. The 
transferor will remain the holder of the shares concerned until the name of 
the transferee is entered in the share register. All instruments of transfer 
which are registered may be retained by the Company. The Directors may 
dispense with the execution of the instrument of transfer by the transferee 
in any case in which they think fit in their discretion to do so. All transfers 
of shares which are in uncertificated form may be effected by means of the 
CREST system. 
The Directors may decline to recognise any instrument of transfer relating 
to shares in certificated form unless it is in respect of only one class of 
share and is lodged (duly stamped if required) at the place where the 
Company’s share register is located accompanied by the relevant share 
certificate(s) and such other evidence as the Directors may reasonably 
require to show the right of the transferor to make the transfer (and, if the 
instrument of transfer is executed by some other person on his behalf, the 
authority of that person so to do). In the case of a transfer by a recognised 
clearing house, or by a nominee of a recognised clearing house or of a 
recognised investment exchange, the lodgement of share certificates will 
only be necessary if and to the extent that certificates have been issued in 
respect of the shares in question. The Directors may, in the case of shares 
in certificated form, in their absolute discretion refuse to register any 
transfer of shares (not being fully paid shares) provided that such 
discretion may not be exercised in such a way as to prevent dealings in the 
shares of that class from taking place on an open and proper basis. The 
Directors may also refuse to register an allotment or transfer of shares 
(whether fully paid or not) in favour of more than four persons jointly. If 
the Directors refuse to register an allotment or transfer of shares they shall 
within two months after the date on which the letter of allotment or 
instrument of transfer was lodged with the Company or the operator 
instruction was received by the Company (in the case of shares held in 
uncertificated form) send to the allottee or transferee notice of the refusal.
A shareholder does not generally need to obtain the approval of the 
Company, or of other shareholders of shares in the Company, for a transfer 
to take place.
The Articles contain certain restrictions on the number of US persons who 
hold shares in the Company so as to have enabled the Company to 
suspend its obligations under the US Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and 
to prevent any such obligations from arising again in the future. 20769-04  13/01/2012 Skeleton 2

Cookson Group plc  
Annual Report for the year ended 31 December 2011
VOTING RIGHTS
Subject to the Articles generally and to any special rights or restrictions 
attached to any class of shares, at a shareholders’ meeting, every 
shareholder who is present in person and every duly appointed proxy shall 
have one vote on a show of hands, and on a poll every shareholder who is 
present in person or by proxy shall have one vote for every ordinary share 
of which he or she is the holder. In the case of joint holders of a share the 
vote of the senior holder who tenders a vote, whether in person or by 
proxy, shall be accepted to the exclusion of the votes of the other joint 
holders and for this purpose seniority shall be determined by the order in 
which the names stand in the share register. A shareholder entitled to 
attend and vote at a shareholders’ meeting is entitled to appoint a proxy or 
proxies to exercise all or any of his or her rights to attend and speak and 
vote in his or her place. A shareholder may appoint more than one proxy 
in relation to a general meeting provided that each proxy is appointed to 
exercise the rights attached to a different share or shares held by the 
shareholder. Proxies need not be shareholders of the Company. For the 
purposes of determining which persons are entitled to attend or vote at a 
meeting and how many votes such person may cast, the Company may 
specify in the notice of the meeting a time, not more than 48 hours before 
the time fixed for the meeting, by which a person must be entered on the 
share register in order to have the right to attend or vote at the meeting.
Restrictions on shares
The Board may withhold payment of all or any part of dividends or other 
monies payable in respect of the Company’s shares from a person with 
0.25% interest or more if such person has been served with a notice after 
failure to provide the Company with information concerning interest in 
those shares required to be provided under the Companies Act.
Variation of rights
Subject to statute, the Articles specify that rights attached to any class of 
shares may be varied with the written consent of the holders of not less 
than three-quarters in nominal value of the issued shares of that class, or 
with the sanction of a special resolution passed at a separate general 
meeting of the holders of those shares. At every such separate general 
meeting the quorum shall be two persons holding or representing by 
proxy at least one-third in nominal value of the issued shares of the class. 
The rights conferred upon the holders of any shares shall not, unless 
otherwise expressly provided in the rights attaching to those shares, be 
deemed to be varied by the creation or issue of further shares ranking 
pari passu with them.
Restrictions on voting
No shareholder shall, unless the Directors otherwise determine, be entitled 
in respect of any share held by him or her to vote either personally or by 
proxy at a shareholders’ meeting or to exercise any other right conferred 
by membership in relation to shareholders’ meetings if any call or other 
sum presently payable by him or her to the Company in respect of that 
share remains unpaid. In addition, if any shareholder, or any other person 
appearing to be interested in shares held by such shareholder, has been 
duly served with a notice to provide the Company with information under 
Section 793 of the Companies Act and has failed to do so within 14 days, 
then (unless the Directors otherwise determine) the shareholder shall not 
(for so long as the default continues) be entitled to attend or vote either 
personally or by proxy at a shareholders’ meeting or to exercise any other 
right conferred by membership in relation to shareholders’ meetings.
APPOINTMENT AND REPLACEMENT OF DIRECTORS
The Company shall have no fewer than five and no more than fifteen 
Directors. The Company may by ordinary resolution from time to time vary 
the minimum number and/or maximum number of Directors. At each 
AGM all those Directors who were elected or last re-elected at or before 
the AGM held in the third calendar year before the current year shall retire 
from office by rotation. 
The Board may appoint any person to be a Director (so long as the total 
number of Directors does not exceed the limit prescribed in the Articles). 
Any such Director shall only hold office until the next AGM and shall then 
be eligible for election. 
AMENDMENT OF ARTICLES OF ASSOCIATION 
The Company may make amendments to the Articles of the Company by 
way of special resolution in accordance with the Companies Act.

DIRECTORS’ REMUNERATION REPORT
ROLE AND RESPONSIBILITIES
The Remuneration Committee (“the Committee”) is responsible for setting the appropriate remuneration for the Chairman, the executive Directors and 
the Group Secretary, and recommending and monitoring the level and structure of remuneration for senior management, being the first layer of 
management below Board level. It also oversees the operation of the Group’s executive share incentive plans. A copy of the Committee’s Terms of 
Reference is available on the Company’s website, www.cooksongroup.co.uk.
COMPOSITION 
The current members of the Committee are all the Non-executive Directors, namely Emma FitzGerald, Jeff Hewitt, Peter Hill, Jan Oosterveld and John 
Sussens, who also chairs the Committee. Messrs Hewitt, Hill, Oosterveld and Sussens served as members of the Committee throughout 2011. Dr 
FitzGerald joined the Committee upon her appointment to the Board on 1 August 2011. Mr Perry served as a member of the Committee until retiring from 
the Board on 12 May 2011. All the members of the Committee are deemed to be independent. The Group Secretary acts as Committee Secretary. The 
Chairman, Chief Executive and Group Finance Director are invited to attend Committee meetings as appropriate but do not participate in discussions of 
their own remuneration.
ADVICE PROVIDED TO THE COMMITTEE  
In formulating its policies and deciding individual remuneration levels, the Committee was advised during the year by the Chief Executive and the Group 
Secretary, by the external advisers Kepler Associates (“Kepler”), New Bridge Street (“NBS”) and Towers Watson (“Towers”), and the law firm Clifford Chance 
LLP (“CC”). Kepler and NBS have been appointed directly by the Committee to provide advice on executive remuneration matters, including remuneration 
structure and policy, updates on market practices and trends, and guidance on the implementation and operation of long-term incentive plans. CC and 
Towers have been appointed by the Company on the Committee’s behalf. CC provides advice on the operation of executive share plans and Towers has 
provided the Committee with remuneration benchmarking data for certain executives based outside the UK. Kepler, NBS and Towers are all signatories to 
the Remuneration Consultants Group Code of Conduct in relation to Executive Remuneration Consulting in the UK. 
Aon Hewitt (the parent company of NBS) provides administration and actuarial services in relation to the Group’s UK and US pension plans, NBS provides 
share award valuation advice to the Company, Towers provides remuneration advice to the Engineered Ceramics division and CC provides legal advice to 
the Company. The Committee does not believe that the provision of any of these services to the Company compromises the independence or integrity of 
the advice that it receives from Kepler, NBS, Towers and CC. 
ACTIVITIES
During the year under review, the Committee met three times. The key matters considered included:
	 ❯ salary review proposals for the executive Directors and senior management;
	 ❯ reviewing achievement against the performance targets, and approving payouts, in respect of 2010 Annual Incentive;
	 ❯ setting performance targets and approving the structure of the 2011 Annual Incentive; 
	 ❯ considering the Group’s performance against the performance conditions applicable to the 2008 Long-Term Incentive Plan, and authorising the 
vesting of these awards;
	 ❯ reviewing the Company’s performance against the performance conditions applicable to the 2009 and 2010 Long-Term Incentive Plans;
	 ❯ setting the performance conditions and authorising the grant of awards for the 2011 Long-Term Incentive Plan;
	 ❯ receiving feedback on the Committee Chairman’s meetings with key institutional shareholders regarding the Group’s remuneration policy and 
practice, and in the light of this, advice received from the external advisers regarding trends in remuneration practice and governance, discussing the 
Group’s approach to executive remuneration and reviewing whether any changes should be made; 
	 ❯ reviewing the Committee’s Terms of Reference, and recommending amendments to the Board for approval; and
	 ❯ reviewing and approving the 2010 Directors’ Remuneration Report.
REMUNERATION POLICY FOR EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS 
The remuneration policy of the Company aims to establish a remuneration structure for executive Directors and other senior managers in the 
Group which:
	 ❯ attracts and retains high calibre executives;
	 ❯ aligns management’s interests with those of shareholders, by incentivising management to enhance shareholder value; and
	 ❯ fosters a high performance culture, linking a substantial portion of remuneration to performance by providing management with the opportunity to 
earn competitive remuneration through variable based pay. 20769-04  13/01/2012 Skeleton 2

Cookson Group plc  
Annual Report for the year ended 31 December 2011
In formulating remuneration policy, the Committee has regard to the international scale and nature of the Group’s operations and takes into 
consideration the requirements of the Code and guidelines issued by its leading shareholders and bodies such as the Association of British Insurers and 
the National Association of Pension Funds. The Committee takes into account the pay and employment conditions of other Group employees when 
determining Directors’ remuneration, particularly when determining base salary increases. The Committee also obtains information on the remuneration 
paid for comparable roles at other companies to provide a point of reference for determining remuneration policy. 
The Committee is cognisant of the need to ensure that the remuneration policy is firmly linked to the Group’s strategy, including its risk management 
philosophy. As all the non-executive Directors serve as members of both the Audit and Remuneration Committees, each Committee benefits from the 
Directors’ experience on the other. This is particularly relevant when the Remuneration Committee is considering matters such as the Group’s 
achievement of performance conditions and the implications for the Group’s risk profile of the award of incentives under the Group’s remuneration 
programmes. The Committee considers the Group’s executive remuneration policy and incentive structure to be compatible with the Group’s risk 
management and internal control systems.
The Board has set a strategy with the objective to grow earnings in both the short-term and longer-term with the intention of delivering above average 
shareholder returns in the medium to long term. This is set out on page 2. This strategy is underpinned by the three-year plan which translates the 
strategy into operational targets. These key operational targets focus on growing annual revenue in excess of global GDP growth, achieving a higher 
return on sales margin and growing annual headline earnings, so that the Group can grow dividend payments and ensure that its return on investment is 
increasingly ahead of the Group’s weighted average cost of capital. At the same time the Group seeks to maintain a strong financial position with a 
leverage ratio of not more than 1.5 times at each year-end. The remuneration policy incentivises and rewards executives to deliver their contribution to 
the achievement of the Group’s strategy, with more than half of the executive Directors’ total remuneration based on the variable, performance-related 
elements of the Annual Incentive and the Long-Term Incentive Plan (“LTIP”). The performance conditions under these arrangements support the Group’s 
focus on growth in profit and shareholder returns by targeting key business imperatives such as Headline earnings (represented by Headline profit 
attributable to owners of the parent, as shown on page 69), relative Total Shareholder Return (“TSR”), defined as the increase in the value of a share, 
including reinvested dividends, and Headline earnings per share (“Headline EPS” , as defined in note 4.5). The inclusion of a working capital performance 
target in the Group’s Annual Incentive further supports the Group’s objective to maintain a strong financial position by reducing leverage. These targets 
are objective, auditable and transparent and as such are considered to be appropriate performance measures for management. To ensure that their 
interests are aligned with those of shareholders, executive Directors are required to build a significant stake in the Company in accordance with the 
Company’s share retention guidelines. At the year-end, all executive Directors substantially exceeded this shareholding guideline. 
The Committee evaluates the efficacy of the Group’s executive remuneration policy each year and commissions more formal reviews as it considers 
appropriate. The review in 2010 resulted in the implementation of clawback arrangements for the executive Directors, divisional CEOs and Group 
Secretary to take effect from the 2011 Annual Incentive and LTIP awards, and resulted in an amendment to the mechanism used for setting the EPS 
targets for the LTIP from a percentage growth target to an absolute EPS target. Further details about these changes are given below. Following the 
Committee’s review in 2011, no further changes were made to the policy and structure of remuneration for the executive Directors. It is anticipated that 
the Group’s existing remuneration policy and structure, as outlined below, will therefore continue in 2012.
CLAWBACK ARRANGEMENTS 
The executive Directors, divisional CEOs and Group Secretary are subject to clawback arrangements. In the event that a misstatement is identified in the 
Group’s consolidated financial statements which requires the restatement of a prior year’s accounts in order to ensure compliance with the requirements 
of International Financial Reporting Standards, then any variable executive remuneration resulting from the misstatement would be subject to clawback 
provisions at the discretion of the Committee. These arrangements are to be applied in respect of the 2011 Annual Incentive, the 2011 LTIP awards, and 
their respective equivalents in future years.
DIALOGUE WITH SHAREHOLDERS 
The Company is committed to open and transparent dialogue with its shareholders on remuneration as well as other matters. As a matter of course the 
Committee consults with key institutional shareholders and various representative bodies about the incentive arrangements of the Company’s executive 
Directors. During the latter part of 2011, the Committee Chairman and Secretary met with the Group’s largest shareholders to discuss the Group’s 
remuneration programme. This included soliciting shareholders’ views on remuneration proposals for 2012 and providing an update on the operation of 
the Group’s incentive programmes. In addition, the opportunity was taken to discuss governance matters.

KEY FEATURES OF THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS’ REMUNERATION
BASE SALARY 
Salary levels are reviewed annually and any increase takes account of the individual’s contribution and experience, and the Group’s financial performance. 
The Committee also considers the pay environment for employees within the Group and the level of salaries paid in similar companies.
As reported in last year’s Directors’ Remuneration Report, in 2011 Messrs Salmon and Wanecq were awarded salary increases of 2.5% in line with increases 
paid to other Group executives, and Mr Butterworth was awarded an increase of 4.5%. The broad budget for salary increases for 2012, throughout the 
Group’s global operations, ranged between 1.5% and 18%, with the latter figure reflecting the impact of wage inflation in certain countries. The standard 
UK increase within the Group is expected to be between 2.5% and 4%. In light of the prevailing economic climate, the Committee decided that no salary 
increases should be awarded to executive Directors in 2012. Accordingly, Messrs Butterworth, Salmon and Wanecq’s salaries remain at £334,160, £540,105 
and €632,528 respectively.
ANNUAL INCENTIVE 
In line with the Group’s other senior executives, the executive Directors are eligible to receive an Annual Incentive calculated as a percentage of base 
salary and based on achievement against specified financial targets. Each year the Committee establishes the financial performance criteria for the 
forthcoming year. These criteria are set by reference to the Group’s financial budget and prior year actual financial results. The target range is set to ensure 
that maximum bonuses are only paid for significantly exceeding market expectations. The Committee considers that the setting and attainment of these 
targets is important in the context of achievement of the Group’s longer-term strategic goals.
The annual incentive has a threshold level of performance below which no award is paid, a target level at which executive Directors are entitled to a 
payment equal to 50% of their base salary and a maximum performance level at which a maximum award is earned. Mr Salmon’s maximum Annual 
Incentive potential is 150% of base salary, and Messrs Butterworth’s and Wanecq’s is 100% of base salary. Any payout for Mr Salmon over 100% of salary is 
payable in deferred shares under the rules of Cookson’s Deferred Share Bonus Plan (further information about this Plan is given on page 44). These shares 
vest on the third anniversary of their award date, although they will lapse if Mr Salmon ceases employment with the Company before the end of the 
three-year period other than in certain circumstances permitted under the Plan rules, such as retirement. 
For the financial year 2011, the executive Directors’ Annual Incentives were based on Group Headline earnings performance, the calculation of which is 
shown in note 12 to the consolidated financial statements. Messrs Butterworth’s and Salmon’s Annual Incentives were assessed solely against this 
criterion, whilst half of Mr Wanecq’s Annual Incentive was assessed against this criterion and the remainder based upon the divisional trading profit of the 
Engineered Ceramics division adjusted for performance against a key operating cash flow target. For 2011, the Group’s performance was above the 
Headline earnings threshold, but below the target and the Engineered Ceramics division’s performance was below the Headline earnings threshold:

Mike Butterworth Group Headline earnings 100% £199.6m 36.25% 36.25%
Nick Salmon Group Headline earnings 100% £199.6m 36.25% 18.51%

François Wanecq Engineered Ceramics trading profit

50% £225.6m 0% 0%
1  
Before allocation of central corporate costs.
Note: Any Annual Incentive payable to Mr Wanecq in respect of the trading profit of the Engineered Ceramics division is subject to an adjustment of 
+/- 5% subject to the achievement of the divisional working capital target.
To put the above performance conditions into perspective, the 2010 Group Headline Earnings was £169.8m and the Engineered Ceramics division’s 
trading profit before allocation of central corporate costs was £184.8m. At the time the performance conditions were set in December 2010, analysts’ 
consensus for 2011 was for Headline earnings of £185.2m.
An Annual Incentive equivalent to 36.25% of base salary will therefore be paid to Mr Butterworth for 2011 and 18.13% of base salary to Mr Wanecq. Given 
the marked deterioration in the performance of the US Precious Metals Processing business necessitating a substantial headcount reduction ahead of its 
disposal, Mr Salmon volunteered to waive part of his annual bonus entitlement. Mr Salmon will therefore receive an annual bonus equivalent to 18.51% of 
base salary for 2011. These annual bonus payments are reported in the Directors’ remuneration table on page 47.  20769-04  13/01/2012 Skeleton 2

Cookson Group plc  
Annual Report for the year ended 31 December 2011
The Committee has determined that for 2012 Messrs Butterworth’s and Salmon’s Annual Incentives will again be based on Group Headline earnings, but this year 
they will also incorporate an adjustment based upon the Group’s working capital performance, to focus greater attention on cash flow performance. The effect of 
this will be to reduce the level of payout that the Directors can achieve by up to 10% if specified working capital targets are not attained. The adjuster can increase 
the level of payout by up to 10%, but not above the usual plan maximum. Mr Wanecq’s Annual Incentive will continue to be based 50% on the aforementioned 
Group Headline earnings target (adjusted for working capital) and 50% on the Engineered Ceramics division’s trading profit (again adjusted for working capital). 
Their maximum incentive potential will remain unchanged at 150% of salary for Mr Salmon and 100% of salary for Messrs Butterworth and Wanecq.
In the past five years, Messrs Butterworth, Salmon and Wanecq have invested £916,662, £1,496,850 and £1,671,345 respectively of their gross cash Annual 
Incentive payments, (representing 88%, 83% and 92% respectively of their total Annual Incentive payments) in the Company’s shares in order to 
participate in the Matching Share element of the Group’s Long-Term Incentive Plan. 
LONG-TERM INCENTIVE PLAN (“L TIP”) 
The LTIP rewards executives for delivering superior TSR, defined as the increase in the value of a share, including reinvested dividends, and Headline EPS 
growth over a set period of time, and as such is intended to align executive remuneration with shareholders’ interests. 
The LTIP has two elements: firstly, executive Directors are eligible to receive a conditional annual allocation of shares worth up to 100% of base salary 
(“Performance Shares”); secondly, executive Directors can elect to invest all or part of their Annual Incentive in ordinary shares of the Company 
(“Investment Shares”) in return for which they receive a conditional allocation of shares worth up to 2.25 times the pre-tax equivalent of the Annual 
Incentive so invested (“Matching Share Award”). The Chief Executive’s maximum investment in the Matching Share element of the LTIP is capped at an 
annual bonus equivalent to 100% of base salary. 
In addition to the executive Directors, senior divisional and corporate executives are allocated Performance Shares under the LTIP and members of the 
Group’s Executive Committee and senior corporate executives are also given the opportunity to participate in the Matching Share element. 
In 2011, each executive Director received an award under the LTIP equal to 100% of salary, as shown on pages 47 and 48. In accordance with the rules of 
the LTIP , Messrs Butterworth, Salmon and Wanecq chose to use more than three-quarters of their cash based Annual Incentive awards to purchase 
Investment Shares and received additional Matching Shares in respect of these investments. These Matching Shares may vest after three years, 
conditional upon the achievement of the performance targets described below.
During the year, the Committee reviewed the use of TSR and Headline EPS as the basis for the LTIP performance conditions. It remained satisfied that they 
continue to be the most appropriate measures of long-term performance for the executive Directors at this point. Many investors regard TSR as an 
important indication of both earnings and capital growth relative to other FTSE 250 companies. The Committee has considered using a sector comparator 
group for measuring TSR performance, but given the lack of directly comparable competitors deems it to be inappropriate. Use of TSR ensures that the 
value of awards vesting reflects improvement in the Company’s performance over the relevant period. Headline EPS is a key indicator of long-term 
financial performance and value creation. The Committee will continue to review the measures as it sees fit to ensure that the LTIP continues to reward 
true value creation and sustainable performance going forward.
The rules of the LTIP allow shares purchased by executives under a rights issue to be designated as Investment Shares and qualify for a Matching Share 
Award. The value of the Matching Share Award relating to shares purchased under a rights issue is, as with any other Matching Share Award, increased as 
if the executive had invested a pre-tax amount in shares under the rights issue. In respect of the 2009 LTIP awards, the Committee specified that the total 
annual maximum value of Investment Shares (however sourced) that could qualify for a Matching Share Award was subject to an overall limit of 100% of 
base salary. Subject to this limit, shares purchased by executives using any Annual Incentive could continue to count as Investment Shares and qualify for 
a Matching Share Award in addition to any shares purchased in the rights issue which were designated as Investment Shares. Within this overall limit, the 
Committee decided, in consultation with major shareholders, that only 63% of shares taken up under the 2009 rights issue could be designated as 
Investment Shares under the LTIP in recognition of the significantly discounted price of the shares issued in the rights issue. The Committee also specified 
that the executive Directors be required to retain all of the Cookson shares that they held at the time of the 2009 rights issue for a period of 36 months 
after the rights issue in order for a Matching Share Award based on shares purchased in the rights issue to be able to vest. 
The Committee has the discretion to award participants in both the Long Term Incentive Plan and the Deferred Share Bonus Plan (“DSBP”)  the dividends 
that would have been paid on the number of shares that vest in respect of dividend record dates occurring during the period between the award date 
and the date of vesting. These dividends can be paid in either cash or shares. The Committee believes that this can be an important step in aligning the 
interests of senior executives with those of shareholders. The Committee exercised this discretion in 2011, awarding these dividends in respect of the 
shares that vested under the 2008 LTIP and the 2008 DSBP . 
Performance Shares and Matching Share Awards made in 2009, 2010 and 2011 vest after three years. From 2011, LTIP awards for some participants were 
granted in the form of nil-cost options. These options will become exercisable, subject to the achievement of the applicable performance conditions, 
three years after their award, and then remain exercisable until the fifth anniversary of their award. This allows each participant the flexibility to decide 
when to exercise their awards rather than the shares being subject to a one-off vesting date on the third anniversary of their award. LTIP awards made 
prior to 2011 have a one-off vesting date three years after the date of the award.

Performance conditions
The proportion of shares vesting is based on the Company’s performance against specified performance conditions. Vesting of 50% of shares awarded is 
based upon the Group’s three-year TSR performance relative to that of the constituent companies, the FTSE 250 excluding Investment Trusts, and 50% on 
Headline EPS (the calculation of which is shown in note 12 to the consolidated financial statements) growth over a three-year period. The two measures 
operate independently. 
Vesting of 50% of Performance Shares and Matching Share Awards under the 2009, 2010, 2011 and 2012 LTIP awards is based on TSR performance in 
accordance with the following schedule:
TSR ranking relative to FTSE 250 
excluding Investment Trusts
Performance Shares 
Vesting Percentage
Matching Shares Vesting Ratio 
(Matching Shares: Investment Shares)
Below Median 0% 0
Median 12.5% 0.25 : 1
Upper Quintile (top 20%) 50% 1.125 : 1
Between Median and Upper Quintile Pro rata between 12.5% and 50% Pro rata between 0.25 : 1 and 1.125 : 1
Vesting of 50% of Performance Shares and Matching Share Awards under the 2009 and 2010 LTIP awards is based on Headline EPS growth, as compared 
with the compound annual growth in the Retail Prices Index (“RPI”), in accordance with the following schedule:
Annual Compound Headline 
EPS Growth above RPI
Performance Shares 
Vesting Percentage
Matching Shares Vesting Ratio
(Matching Shares: Investment Shares)
Below 3% 0% 0
3% 12.5% 0.25 : 1
At or above 10% 50% 1.125 : 1
Between 3% and 10% Pro rata between 12.5% and 50% Pro rata between 0.25 : 1 and 1.125 : 1
In 2011, the Committee changed the criterion applicable to the Headline EPS element of the performance condition. The new condition is that the Group 
has to achieve an actual EPS performance target at the end of the three-year performance period. Vesting of 50% of Performance Shares and Matching 
Share Awards under the 2011 LTIP awards is therefore based on Headline EPS growth in accordance with the following schedule:
Headline EPS for 2013 financial year
Performance Shares 
Vesting Percentage
Matching Shares Vesting Ratio 
(Matching Shares: Investment Shares)
Less than 82.0 pence 0% 0
82.0 pence 12.5% 0.25 : 1
98.5 pence or more 50% 1.125 : 1
Between 82.0 pence and 98.5 pence Pro rata between 12.5% and 50% Pro rata between 0.25 : 1 and 1.125 : 1
The Group’s Headline EPS for 2011 was 70.4p.
The performance criteria and award policy were, once again, reviewed by the Committee during the year. Following this review, the Committee 
determined that vesting of 50% of Performance Shares and Matching Share Awards for the 2012 LTIP awards will be based on Headline EPS growth in 
accordance with the following schedule:
Headline EPS for 2014 financial year
Performance Shares 
Vesting Percentage
Matching Shares Vesting Ratio 
(Matching Shares: Investment Shares)
Less than 85.0 pence 0% 0
85.0 pence 12.5% 0.25 : 1
105.0 pence or more 50% 1.125 : 1
Between 85.0 pence and 105.0 pence Pro rata between 12.5% and 50% Pro rata between 0.25 : 1 and 1.125 : 1
Matching Share Awards will only vest if the Investment Shares originally purchased have been retained. 
The Committee obtains independent external advice to assess whether the Company has met the TSR performance condition at the end of the relevant 
performance period and to confirm that the companies which make up the index and the measurement of the Company’s performance are both in 
accordance with the rules of the LTIP . Measurement of the Group’s TSR takes place over a performance period commencing on the first day of Cookson’s 
financial year in which the award is granted. TSR is measured as the percentage increase in a return index for Cookson and each comparator company 
between the beginning and end of the performance period. The return index at the beginning of the performance period is the average of the return 
index on each weekday in the three-month period prior to the start of the performance period. The same three-month averaging method is used to 
ascertain the return index at the end of the performance period. The companies are then ranked, in descending order, according to their TSR. If Cookson is 
ranked at or above the median of the comparator group then a proportion of the awards is eligible to vest.  20769-04  13/01/2012 Skeleton 2

Cookson Group plc  
Annual Report for the year ended 31 December 2011
The Group’s Headline EPS is calculated on a consistent basis and the Committee has the discretion to adjust for exceptional items as it deems appropriate. 
Growth in Headline EPS is the annualised percentage growth over the performance period. Headline EPS for the base year — i.e. the calendar year prior to 
the award date — is compared with the final year — i.e. the calendar year three years after the base year. For the 2009 and 2010 LTIP awards this was 
expressed as compound annual growth, above the compound annual growth in RPI. 
In 2009, the Committee adjusted the performance conditions applicable to the Company’s outstanding LTIP awards to take account of the Company’s 
2009 rights issue. The adjustments made to the calculation of TSR, reflecting the actual behaviour of the majority of shareholders, and aligned with the 
executive Directors’ own investments, were based upon the assumption that all available rights under the Company’s rights issue, and any rights issues 
carried out by members of the comparator group during the performance period, were taken up in full by eligible shareholders. The adjustments also 
assumed that funds had been borrowed for the purpose of taking up these rights at a borrowing cost of 6% p.a. The TSR of the other companies forming 
part of the LTIP comparator group which had undertaken a rights issue during the performance period were also adjusted on a similar basis. The 
adjustments made to the calculation of the Headline EPS performance conditions were based upon the assumption that the rights issue had taken place, 
on a pro forma basis, at the beginning of the base year, including an adjustment for notional interest on the rights issue funds received in the base year. 
Vesting of 2009 L TIP awards
The performance period applicable to the awards made in 2009 ended on 31 December 2011. The Company’s TSR performance during this three-year 
performance period was assessed against the comparator group and it was determined that the Company’s performance was above upper quintile. In 
addition, the Company’s annual compound Headline EPS growth was assessed for the three-year performance period as being over 10% above RPI. The 2009 
LTIP awards will therefore vest in full. Prior to the vesting of any award, the Committee stipulates that, as an additional hurdle, it needs to be satisfied that 
vesting has been justified by the underlying financial performance of the Group over the performance period. Having carefully considered the Group’s 
performance over the three-year period, and taking into account the significant improvement in the Group’s financial results — including the Group’s 
revenue, trading profit, return on sales margins, and profit before tax — the Committee concluded that the vesting of the 2009 LTIP awards is justified by the 
underlying financial performance of the Group. Accordingly, all of the 2009 LTIP awards will vest on 25 March 2012. 
The executive Directors have undertaken that they will not dispose of any of the LTIP shares which vest in March 2012 for a period of 12 months from the date 
of vesting, other than to sell sufficient shares to meet income tax and social security liabilities arising thereon.
Historic vesting under the L TIP
The table below sets out the vesting levels for the LTIP awards made to executives since the plan commenced in 2004. The awards made in 2004, 2005 and 
2006 were assessed solely against a TSR performance condition, whilst awards since this time have been based half on a TSR performance condition and 
half on a Headline EPS performance condition:

2004 2004–2006 0% n/a 0%

2009 2009–2011 50% 50% 100%
Average annual vesting 42%
Under the rules of the LTIP the Company has the discretion to satisfy awards either by the transfer of existing shares or by the allotment of newly issued 
shares. The decision on how to satisfy awards is taken by the Board, which considers the most prudent and appropriate sourcing arrangement for the 
Company. 
OTHER PLANS 
Deferred Share Bonus Plan (“DSBP”) 
The Group’s DSBP was implemented in 2007 to provide an alternative long-term incentive arrangement for certain executives. The senior managers who 
participate in this plan receive an allocation of deferred shares to the value of a percentage of their annual bonus. 
In 2010, Mr Salmon’s maximum annual incentive entitlement was increased to 150%. Any payout for Mr Salmon over 100% of salary is payable in deferred 
shares under the DSBP . 
Shares awarded under the DSBP are sourced from existing shares and vest after three years, although an executive’s allocation may lapse if he or she 
ceases employment in certain circumstances before the end of the three-year period.

Executive share option schemes (“ESOS”) 
Under the ESOS the Company granted share options, with an option exercise price fixed by reference to the market price prevailing at the time of grant, 
the exercise of which was subject to a Headline EPS performance condition. The last executive share option grant was made in 2003 and the Company 
does not intend to make any further grants under the schemes. Following the Company’s rights issue in 2009, the Directors approved adjustments to the 
number of shares granted under all outstanding options or awards and to any associated exercise price. Adjustments were made in accordance with the 
rules of the relevant plan and where required by plan rules, adjustments were made with the prior approval of HMRC and/or the Company’s Auditor. 
Further details of the awards and options outstanding under these share plans are given in note 29 to the consolidated financial statements and 
note 13 to the Company financial statements. 
SHARE USAGE
As at 31 December 2011, 1,172,698 shares were held in the Company’s employee share ownership trust (“ESOP”). The trustee of the ESOP purchases shares in 
the open market or can subscribe for newly issued shares as required, to meet obligations for the provision of shares to satisfy options and awards that vest. 
Cookson share plans comply with the current ABI guidelines on headroom which provide that overall dilution under all plans should not exceed 10% over 
a ten year period in relation to the Company’s issued share capital, with a further limitation of 5% in any ten year period on discretionary schemes. In the 
last ten years less than 1% of the Company’s current issued share capital has been allotted to settle obligations arising from the exercise or vesting of 
executive and all employee share incentives and thus the Company remains well within the limits. 
Details of the awards outstanding under the Company’s share plans as at 31 December 2011 and where granted as options, the associated exercise prices, 
are given in note 29 to the consolidated financial statements and note 13 to the Company financial statements.

Annual Report for the year ended 31 December 2011
DIRECTORS’ CONTRACTS 
The following paragraphs summarise the main terms and conditions of the contracts of the Directors: 
Executive Directors 
In line with the policy of the Committee, Messrs Butterworth and Salmon have UK service contracts which have 12 month unexpired terms and provide for 12 
months’ notice being given by the Company and six months by them. Mr Salmon’s contract was dated 14 June 2004 and Mr Butterworth’s 25 May 2005. Each 
contract provides for compensation to be paid on early termination by the Company based on one times salary, pension allowance and benefits payable half in a 
lump sum and the balance in six separate monthly instalments commencing six months after leaving, mitigated by any salary earned from any new paid 
occupation. Mr Wanecq is contracted to Vesuvius Group NV/SA, under a Belgian services agreement dated 1 March 2006 for which his remuneration is in the form 
of fees. His appointment to the Cookson Group plc Board is subject to a separate appointment agreement for which no fee is payable. His termination 
arrangements are structured to effectively mirror Messrs Butterworth’s and Salmon’s arrangements including the notice period and mitigation obligations. 
None of the executive Directors’ contracts contain any change of control provisions and they all contain a duty to mitigate should the Director find an 
alternative paid occupation in any period during which the Company must otherwise pay compensation on early termination. Other than as described for 
Mr Wanecq, no Directors had any material interest in a contract of significance (other than service agreements) with the Company or any subsidiary 
company during the year. 
Non-executive Directors 
Each Non-executive Director is appointed for an initial fixed term of three years subject to their election at the Company’s first Annual General Meeting 
following their appointment and re-election at intervening Annual General Meetings. Thereafter, subject to approval of the Board and their continued 
re-election by shareholders, they are appointed for a further three-year term.

The Chairman, Mr Harris, was appointed as a Non-executive Director on 1 April 2010 and succeeded Mr Beeston as Chairman at the conclusion of the 2010 
Annual General Meeting. Mr Harris was appointed for a fixed period which is due to expire at the conclusion of the Annual General Meeting in 2016. He is 
entitled to six months’ notice from the Company. Any compensation for loss of office would be based upon his fee. None of the other Non-executive 
Directors are entitled to receive compensation for loss of office at any time. 
All Directors are subject to retirement, and election or re-election, in accordance with the Company’s Articles of Association. 
The Board sets the remuneration of the Non-executive Directors after considering the role and responsibilities of each Director and the practice of other 
companies. The Non-executive Directors do not participate in Board discussions on their own remuneration. 
EXTERNAL APPOINTMENTS 
Executive Directors are permitted to hold positions as non-executive directors of other companies provided that these do not lead to conflicts of interest. 
The Board sanctions each such request on a case-by-case basis. Fees received are retained by the executive Director concerned. In 2011, Mr Salmon 
received fees of £66,000 for his role as senior independent non-executive director of United Utilities Group plc. Mr Butterworth received fees of £34,000 
for his role as non-executive director and chairman of the Audit Committee of St Ives plc.
PENSION ARRANGEMENTS 
Messrs Butterworth and Salmon are not entitled to participate in any of the Group’s pension arrangements. In accordance with their contracts they 
received pension allowances of 30% of their base salaries in 2011 to enable them to make their own pension provision. Mr Butterworth’s pension 
allowance in 2011 amounted to £100,248 (2010: £95,931), whilst Mr Salmon’s pension allowance in 2011 amounted to £162,031 (2010: £158,080). 
Mr Wanecq is entitled to a pension allowance of 30% of his base salary. This amounted to £163,661 in 2011 (2010: £145,505). This comprised his 
participation in two Group pension arrangements, the US 401K Savings Plan and a Belgian defined contribution plan operated by external providers to 
the maximum level and a salary supplement.

Notes 
1.  The interests and market prices shown have been adjusted for the rights issue which took effect in March 2009, and where applicable for the subsequent consolidation of the Company’s ordinary 
shares which took effect on 15 May 2009, when every ten ordinary 10p shares held by shareholders at the close of business on 14 May 2009 were exchanged for one new £1 ordinary share.
2.  In 2011 Messrs Butterworth, Salmon and Wanecq received potential maximum allocations of Performance Shares worth one times their respective base salaries. Under the Matching Share award element 
of the LTIP they used their 2010 Annual Incentive payments to purchase 19,698, 28,757 and 45,850 shares respectively, and received maximum allocations of Matching Share Awards based on these 
amounts. These had a maximum potential value on the date of award equivalent to circa two times their respective base salaries. The allocations were made to Messrs Butterworth, Salmon and Wanecq on 
1 April 2011 and the allocations were calculated based upon the closing mid-market price of Cookson’s shares on the day before the awards were made. Cookson’s mid-market closing price on the 1 April 
2011 was 705p.
3.  In 2011 Mr Salmon was awarded an Annual Incentive bonus in respect of 2010 equivalent to 150% of his base salary. One-third of Mr Salmon’s Annual Incentive bonus (equivalent to 50% of his base 
salary) was paid in deferred shares under the DSBP . This allocation of deferred shares was made to Mr Salmon on 1 April 2011, calculated based upon the closing mid-market price of Cookson’s shares 
on the day before the awards were made. Cookson’s mid-market closing price on 1 April 2011 was 705p. These shares will vest on the third anniversary of their award date although they will lapse if Mr 
Salmon ceases employment with the Company before the end of the three-year period other than in certain circumstances permitted under the DSBP Rules, such as retirement.
4.  The mid-market closing price of Cookson’s shares ranged between 395.8p and 724.5p during 2011 and on 30 December 2011 was 509p.
5.  The performance criteria which apply to the vesting of share allocations under the LTIP are summarised on pages 42 to 44.
6.  The performance period for the LTIP awards made in 2008 ended on 31 December 2010. The Company’s TSR performance during the three-year performance period was assessed against the 
comparator group and it was determined that the Company’s performance was below median. The Company’s annual compound Headline EPS growth over RPI was assessed as being above 10% 
during this period. The Remuneration Committee confirmed that it was satisfied that the vesting of awards under the 2008 LTIP was justified by the underlying financial performance of the Group over 
the performance period. Accordingly, 100% of the half of the 2008 LTIP awards that was based on Headline EPS performance vested on the third anniversary of their award. Messrs Butterworth, 
Salmon’s and Wanecq’s awards vested on 31 March 2011. The mid-market closing price of Cookson’s shares was 689.5p; the value of shares transferred to Messrs Butterworth, Salmon and Wanecq was 
£340,076, £538,887 and £443,380 respectively. The total aggregate value of the shares transferred to them was £1,322,343. They each sold sufficient shares on vesting to meet their associated tax 
liabilities. The Remuneration Committee also exercised its discretion to award participants in the LTIP the dividends that would have accrued during the vesting period on the shares that vested. As a 
result Messrs Butterworth, Salmon and Wanecq received cash payments of £10,843, £17,182 and £14,137 respectively. 
7.  The performance period for the LTIP awards made in 2009 ended on 31 December 2011. The Company’s TSR performance during the three-year performance period was assessed against the 
comparator group and it was determined that the Company’s performance was above the upper quintile. The Company’s annual compound Headline EPS growth over RPI was assessed as being 
greater than 10% during this period. The Remuneration Committee has confirmed that it is satisfied that the vesting of awards under the 2009 LTIP is justified by the underlying financial performance 
of the Group over the performance period. Accordingly, 100% of the 2009 LTIP awards will vest on the third anniversary of their award. Participants will receive the dividends that would have been 
earned during the three year vesting period. These dividends will be paid by way of shares.
8. Messrs Butterworth and Salmon’s 2011 awards were made in the form of nil-cost options. These options become exerciseable, subject to the achievement of the applicable performance conditions,   
 three years after their award, and then remain exerciseable until the fifth anniversary of their award.
9.  The information in the above table is audited by the Company’s Auditor.

vesting under the LTIP , until this criterion has been met. 
As at 31 December 2011, using the Company’s share price at 31 December 2011 of £5.09, the executive Directors’ shareholdings against this guideline 
were as follows:

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
1. GENERAL INFORMATION
Cookson Group plc (“the Company”) is a public limited company registered in England and Wales and listed on the London Stock Exchange. The 
nature of the operations and principal activities of the Company and its subsidiary and joint venture companies (“the Group”) are set out in the 
Operating Review on pages 11 to 16 and its registered address is shown on page 107.
2.  BASIS OF PREPARATION
2.1  BASIS OF ACCOUNTING
The consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the 
European Union (“IFRS”) and, with the exception of defined benefits pension plans and derivative financial instruments, under the historical cost 
convention in accordance with the Companies Act 2006.
2.2  BASIS OF CONSOLIDATION
The consolidated financial statements of the Group incorporate the financial statements of the Company and entities controlled by the Company 
(its “subsidiaries”). Control exists when the Company has the power to govern the financial and operating policies of an entity so as to obtain 
benefits from its activities. In assessing whether control exists, potential voting rights that are currently exercisable are taken into account. The 
results of subsidiaries acquired or disposed of during the year are included in the Group income statement from the effective date of acquisition 
or up to the effective date of disposal, as appropriate.
Where necessary, adjustments are made to the financial statements of subsidiaries to bring their accounting policies into line with those detailed 
herein to ensure that the Group financial statements are prepared on a consistent basis. All intra-Group transactions, balances, income and 
expenses are eliminated on consolidation.
Non-controlling interests in the net assets of consolidated subsidiaries are identified separately from the Group’s interest therein. Non-controlling 
interests consist of the amount of those interests at the date of the original business combination together with the non-controlling interests’ 
share of profit or loss and each component of other comprehensive income since the date of the combination. Total comprehensive income is 
attributed to the non-controlling interests even if this results in the non-controlling interests having a deficit balance.
2.3  GOING CONCERN
As discussed in more detail in the Directors’ Report on page 32, the Directors have a reasonable expectation that the Group has adequate 
resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future and, accordingly, they have continued to adopt the going concern basis 
in preparing the financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2011.
2.4  FUNCTIONAL AND PRESENTATION CURRENCY
The financial statements are presented in millions of pounds sterling, which is the functional currency of the Company, and rounded to one 
decimal place. Foreign operations are included in accordance with the policies set out in note 27.1.
2.5  DISCLOSURE OF EXCEPTIONAL ITEMS
IAS 1, Presentation of Financial Statements, provides no definitive guidance as to the format of the income statement, but states key lines which 
should be disclosed. It also encourages the disclosure of additional line items and the reordering of items presented on the face of the income 
statement when appropriate for a proper understanding of the entity’s financial performance. In accordance with IAS 1, the Company has 
adopted a policy of disclosing separately on the face of its Group income statement the effect of any components of financial performance 
considered by the Directors to be exceptional, or for which separate disclosure would assist both in a better understanding of the financial 
performance achieved and in making projections of future results.
Both materiality and the nature and function of the components of income and expense are considered in deciding upon such presentation. 
Such items may include, inter alia, amortisation charges relating to intangible assets, the financial effect of major restructuring activity, profits 
or losses relating to non-current assets, gains or losses relating to employee benefits plans, finance costs, profits or losses arising on business 
disposals, and other items, including the taxation impact of the aforementioned items, which have a significant impact on the Group’s results 
either due to their size or nature. 20769-04  13/01/2012 Skeleton 2

Annual Report for the year ended 31 December 2011
2.  BASIS OF PREPARATION (CONTINUED)
2.6  NEW AND REVISED IFRS
During the year a number of amendments to IFRS became effective and were adopted by the Group, none of which had a material impact on 
the Group’s net cash flows, financial position, total comprehensive income or earnings per share. A number of other new and amended IFRS 
were issued during the year which do not become effective until after 1 January 2012, none of which are likely to have a material impact on the 
Group’s net cash flows, financial position, total comprehensive income or earnings per share.
3.  CRITICAL JUDGEMENTS IN APPLYING ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND KEY SOURCES OF ESTIMATION UNCERTAINTY
Determining the carrying amount of some assets and liabilities requires estimation of the effect of uncertain future events. The major sources of 
estimation uncertainty that have a significant risk of resulting in a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets or liabilities are  
noted below.
3.1  GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS
The Directors use their judgement to determine the extent to which goodwill and other capitalised intangible assets have a value that will 
benefit the performance of the Group over future periods. To assist in making this judgement, the Directors undertake an assessment, at least 
annually, of the carrying value of the Group’s capitalised goodwill and other intangible assets. In the assessment undertaken as at 31 December 
2011, further details of which are given in note 18, value in use was derived from discounted five-year cash flow projections, using a growth 
rate of 2.5% in the years beyond the projection period and pre-tax discount rates. The projection period is, in the opinion of the Directors, an 
appropriate period over which to view the future results of the Group’s businesses for this purpose. Changes to the assumptions used in making 
these forecasts could significantly alter the Directors’ assessment of the carrying value of goodwill and other intangible assets.
3.2  EMPLOYEE BENEFITS
The Group’s financial statements include the costs and obligations associated with the provision of pension and other post-retirement benefits 
to current and former employees. It is the Directors’ responsibility to set the assumptions used in determining the key elements of the costs of 
meeting such future obligations. These assumptions are set after consultation with the Group’s actuaries and include those used to determine 
regular service costs and the financing elements related to the plans’ assets and liabilities. Whilst the Directors believe that the assumptions used 
are appropriate, a change in the assumptions used would affect the Group’s profit and financial position.
3.3  LIABILITY RESERVES
Cookson has extensive international operations and is subject to various legal and regulatory regimes, including those covering taxation and 
environmental matters. Several of the Group’s subsidiaries are parties to legal proceedings, certain of which are insured claims arising in the 
ordinary course of the operations of the company involved, and are aware of a number of issues which are, or may be, the subject of dispute with 
tax authorities. Reserves are made for the expected amounts payable in respect of known or probable costs resulting both from legal or other 
regulatory requirements, or from third-party claims. As the settlement of many of the obligations for which reserve is made is subject to legal or 
other regulatory process, the timing and amount of the associated outflows is subject to some uncertainty. The Directors use their judgement 
and experience to make reserves in the financial statements for an appropriate amount relating to such matters.
3.4  TAXATION
(a)  Current tax
Tax benefits are not recognised unless it is probable that they will result in future economic benefits to the Group. In assessing the amount of the 
benefit to be recognised in the financial statements, the Directors exercise their judgement in considering the effect of negotiations, litigation 
and any other matters that they consider may impact upon the potential settlement. Any interest and penalties on tax liabilities are provided for 
in the tax charge. The Group operates internationally and is subject to tax in many different jurisdictions. As a consequence, the Group is routinely 
subject to tax audits and local enquiries which, by their very nature, can take a considerable period of time to conclude. Provisions are made for 
known issues based upon the Directors’ interpretation of country-specific tax law and their assessment of the likely outcome.

3.  CRITICAL JUDGEMENTS IN APPLYING ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND KEY SOURCES OF ESTIMATION UNCERTAINTY (CONTINUED)
3.4  TAXATION (CONTINUED)
(b)  Deferred tax
The Group has recognised deferred tax assets in respect of unutilised losses and other timing differences arising in a number of the Group’s 
businesses. Account has been taken of future forecasts of taxable profit in arriving at the values at which these assets are recognised. If these 
forecast profits do not materialise or change, or there are changes in tax rates or to the period over which the losses or timing differences might 
be recognised, then the value of deferred tax assets will need to be revised in a future period.
The Group also has losses and other timing differences for which no deferred tax assets have been recognised in these financial statements, 
relating either to loss-making subsidiaries where the future economic benefit of the timing difference is not probable or to where the timing 
difference is of such a nature that its value is dependent on certain types of profit being earned, such as capital profits. If trading or other 
appropriate profits are earned in future in these companies, these losses and other timing differences may yield benefit to the Group in the form 
of a reduced tax charge.
4.  NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES
The Company uses a number of non-Generally Accepted Accounting Practice (“non-GAAP”) financial measures in addition to those reported in 
accordance with IFRS. The Directors believe that these non-GAAP measures, listed below, are important when assessing the underlying financial 
and operating performance of the Group and its divisions.
4.1 NET SALES VALUE
Net sales value is calculated as revenue, excluding the amount included therein related to commodity metals. 
4.2 RETURN ON SALES AND RETURN ON NET SALES VALUE
Return on sales is calculated as trading profit divided by revenue. Return on net sales value is calculated as trading profit divided by net 
sales value. 
4.3 UNDERLYING REVENUE
Underlying revenue is calculated as net sales value adjusted to exclude the effects of changes in exchange rates and business acquisitions, 
disposals and closures. 
4.4  HEADLINE PROFIT BEFORE TAX
Headline profit before tax is calculated as the net total of trading profit, plus the Group’s share of post-tax profit of joint ventures and total net 
finance costs associated with ordinary activities. 
4.5  HEADLINE EARNINGS PER SHARE
Headline earnings per share is calculated as headline profit before tax and after income tax costs associated with ordinary activities and profit 
attributable to non-controlling interests, divided by the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue during the year. 
4.6  FREE CASH FLOW
Free cash flow is defined as net cash flow from operating activities after net outlays for the purchase and sale of property, plant and equipment, 
dividends from joint ventures and dividends paid to non-controlling shareholders, but before additional funding contributions to Group  
pension plans. 
4.7 AVERAGE WORKING CAPITAL TO SALES RATIO
The average working capital to sales ratio is calculated as the percentage of average working capital balances to the annualised revenue for the 
year. Average working capital (comprising inventories, trade and other receivables, and trade and other payables) is calculated as the average of 
the six previous month-end balances, and annualised revenue is derived from the revenue for the previous six months. 
4.8 EBITDA
EBITDA is calculated as the total of trading profit before depreciation charges. 
4.9  NET INTEREST
Net interest is calculated as interest payable on borrowings less interest receivable, excluding any item therein considered by the Directors to be 
exceptional. 20769-04  13/01/2012 Skeleton 2
60
Cookson Group plc  
Annual Report for the year ended 31 December 2011
4.  NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES (CONTINUED)
4.10 INTEREST COVER
Interest cover is the ratio of EBITDA to net interest. 
4.11  NET DEBT
Net debt comprises the net total of current and non-current interest-bearing borrowings and cash and short-term deposits. 
4.12 NET DEBT TO EBITDA
Net debt to EBITDA is the ratio of net debt at the year-end to EBITDA for that year. 
4.13  RETURN ON NET ASSETS
Return on net assets (“RONA”) is calculated as trading profit plus share of post-tax profit of joint ventures, divided by average net operating assets (being 
the average over the previous 12 months of property, plant and equipment, trade working capital and other operating receivables and payables). 
4.14  RETURN ON INVESTMENT
Return on investment (“ROI”) is calculated as trading profit after tax plus share of post-tax profit of joint ventures, divided by invested capital 
(being total equity plus net debt, net employee benefits liabilities and goodwill previously written off to, or amortised against, reserves). 
5.  SEGMENT INFORMATION
The segment information contained in this note makes reference to several non-GAAP financial measures, definitions for which can be found  
in note 4.
5.1 ACCOUNTING POLICY
(a)  Revenue recognition
Revenue comprises the fair value of the consideration received or receivable for goods supplied and services rendered to customers after 
deducting rebates, discounts and value-added taxes, and after eliminating sales within the Group. Revenue from the sale of goods is recognised 
when persuasive evidence exists, usually in the form of an executed sales agreement, that the significant risks and rewards of ownership have 
been transferred to the customer, recovery of the consideration is probable, there is no continuing management involvement with the goods, and 
the amount of revenue can be measured reliably. A provision for anticipated returns is made based primarily on historical return rates. Revenue 
from multi-year contractual arrangements, such as equipment installation contracts, is recognised as performance occurs. Where a contractual 
arrangement consists of two or more separate elements that can be provided to customers either on a stand-alone basis or as an extra, such as the 
provision of supplementary materials with equipment, revenue is recognised for each element as if it were an individual contractual arrangement.
(b) Research and development costs
Expenditure on research activities is recognised in the income statement as an expense in the year in which it is incurred. Expenditure on 
development activities is capitalised if the product or process is technically and commercially feasible and the Group has sufficient resources 
to complete development. All other development expenditure is recognised in the income statement as an expense in the year in which it is 
incurred. Capitalised development expenditure is stated at cost less accumulated amortisation and impairment losses. 
5.2 BUSINESS SEGMENTS
For reporting purposes, the Group is organised into three main business segments: Engineered Ceramics, Performance Materials and Precious 
Metals Processing and the senior executive management of each of these business segments reports to the Chief Executive of the Group. It is the 
Cookson Board which makes the key operating decisions in respect of these segments. The information used by the Cookson Board to review 
performance and determine resource allocation between the business segments is presented with the Group’s activities segmented between the 
three business segments, Engineered Ceramics, Performance Materials and Precious Metals Processing. Taking into account not only the basis on 
which the Group’s activities are reported to the Cookson Board, but also the nature of the products and services of the product lines within each 
of these segments, the production processes involved in each and the nature of their end-markets, the Directors believe that these three business 
segments are the appropriate way to analyse the Group’s results. The principal activities of each of these segments are described in the Operating 
Review on pages 11 to 16.
Segment revenue represents revenue from external customers (inter-segment revenue is not material) and segment result is equivalent to 
trading profit excluding corporate costs directly related to managing the parent company, which are reported separately in the tables below. 
Segment net operating assets exclude goodwill and other intangible assets, net debt, net employee benefits liabilities, net income tax liabilities 
and other net non-operating liabilities. Segment result and segment net operating assets include items directly attributable to a segment as well 
as those items that can be allocated on a reasonable basis.

The restructuring charge for the year was £8.9m (2010: £17.3m) comprising gross charges of £11.7m offset by £2.8m of profits arising on the 
sale of vacant properties. The charges arose in connection with initiatives that included redundancy programmes, the downsizing or closure 
of facilities, the streamlining of manufacturing processes and the rationalisation of product lines. The net tax credit attributable to these 
restructuring charges was £1.6m (2010: £3.6m).
Cash costs of £13.2m (2010: £23.8m) were incurred in the year in respect of the restructuring initiatives commenced both in 2011 and in prior 
years, leaving provisions made but unspent of £31.5m (note 32) as at 31 December 2011 (2010: £38.4m), of which £24.4m relates to future lease 
costs in respect of leases expiring between 2 and 17 years.

Of the loss of £36.5m (2010: £0.6m) reported in 2011, £29.0m related to the US business of the Precious Metals Processing division that was in 
the process of being disposed of as at 31 December 2011 and which was classified as held for sale at that date in the Group balance sheet (notes 
22 and 38). The remaining £7.5m comprised charges in relation to a number of small business closures in 2011 and trailing costs for some prior 
year closures. The £0.6m loss in 2010 related to a number of small disposals from the Group’s Engineered Ceramics and Performance Materials 
divisions. A tax credit of £0.4m (2010: £nil) was associated with these losses.
10.  FINANCE COSTS AND FINANCE INCOME
10.1  ACCOUNTING POLICY
The ineffective portion of the change in fair value of interest rate swaps designated as cash flow hedges is included within interest payable on 
loans and overdrafts. Borrowing costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition, construction or production of an asset that necessarily 
takes a substantial period of time to get ready for its intended use or sale are capitalised as part of the cost of that asset. All other borrowing costs 
are recognised as an expense in the income statement using the effective interest rate method.

10.4  EXCEPTIONAL FINANCE COSTS
Exceptional finance costs of £1.9m (2010: £3.0m) were incurred in the year resulting from the early write-off of unamortised borrowing costs 
as a consequence of the Group entering into a new revolving credit facility. The costs written off related to the old facility that had been due to 
expire in 2012. The exceptional finance costs of £3.0m reported in 2010, resulted from the early repayment of certain committed bank facility 
borrowings, as a consequence of the issuance of $250m US Private Placement Loan Notes in December 2010. The tax associated with these 
exceptional finance costs was £nil (2010: £nil).
11.  INCOME TAX
11.1  ACCOUNTING POLICY
Tax expense represents the sum of current tax and deferred tax. Current and deferred tax are recognised in profit or loss except to the extent that 
they relate to items charged or credited in other comprehensive income or directly to equity, in which case the associated tax is also dealt with in 
other comprehensive income or directly in equity.
Current tax is based on taxable profit for the year. Taxable profit differs from profit before tax as reported in the income statement because 
it excludes items of income or expense that are taxable or deductible in other years and it further excludes items that are never taxable or 
deductible. The Group’s liability for current tax is calculated using tax rates and laws that have been enacted, or substantively enacted, by the 
balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is recognised on differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in the financial statements and the 
corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable profit and is accounted for using the balance sheet liability method. Deferred tax 
liabilities are generally recognised for all taxable temporary differences and deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable 
that taxable profits will be available against which deductible temporary differences can be utilised. Such assets and liabilities are not recognised 
if the temporary difference arises from the initial recognition of goodwill or from the initial recognition (other than in a business combination) 
of other assets and liabilities in a transaction that affects neither the taxable profit nor the accounting profit. Deferred tax is calculated at the 
tax rates that are expected to apply in the period when the liability is settled or the asset is realised, based on tax rates and laws that have been 
enacted, or substantively enacted, by the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for taxable temporary differences arising on investments in subsidiaries and interests in joint ventures, 
except where the Group is able to control the reversal of the temporary difference and it is probable that the temporary difference will not 
reverse in the foreseeable future. The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each balance sheet date and reduced to the extent 
that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profits will be available to allow all or part of the asset to be recovered. Deferred tax assets 
and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to set off current tax assets against current tax liabilities and when they relate to 
income taxes levied by the same taxation authority and the Group intends to settle its current tax assets and liabilities on a net basis.

The Group’s total income tax costs of £58.9m (2010: £37.3m) include a credit of £2.5m (2010: £9.4m) relating to exceptional items comprising: a 
credit of £1.6m (2010: £3.6m) in relation to restructuring charges; a credit of £7.2m (2010: £6.4m) relating to the amortisation of intangible assets; 
a charge of £2.9m (2010: £0.4m) relating to deferred tax on goodwill; a charge of £3.8m (2010: £nil) in relation to gains relating to employee 
benefits plans; a credit of £0.4m (2010: £nil) relating to the loss on disposal of continuing operations; and a charge of £nil (2010: £0.2m) relating 
to non-current assets.
Tax charged in the Group statement of comprehensive income in the year amounted to £11.9m (2010: £0.7m), all of which related to net actuarial 
gains and losses on employee benefits plans. 
The Group operates in a number of countries that have differing tax rates, laws and practices. Changes in any of these areas could, adversely 
or positively, impact the Group’s tax charge in the future. Continuing losses, or insufficiency of taxable profit to absorb all expenses, in any 
subsidiary could have the effect of increasing tax charges in the future, relative to 2011, as effective tax relief may not be available for those losses 
or expenses. Other significant factors affecting the tax charge are described in notes 3.4 and 11.1.

Net total deferred tax liabilities (85.7) (75.8)
Tax loss carry-forwards and other temporary differences of £1.6m (2010: £4.9m) were recognised by subsidiaries reporting a loss in 2010 or 
2011. On the basis of approved business plans of these subsidiaries and in view of the significant improvement in market conditions in 2011, the 
Directors consider it probable that the tax loss carry-forwards and temporary differences can be offset against future taxable profits.
The total deferred tax asset not recognised as at 31 December 2011 was £483.7m (2010: £483.0m). This consisted of: £41.9m (2010: £45.4m) 
relating to capital losses that are available to offset future UK capital gains and may be carried forward without time limit; £230.9m (2010: £232.6m) 
relating to operating losses; £92.3m (2010: £92.4m) relating to unrelieved interest; £13.1m (2010: £13.1m) relating to UK ACT tax credits, which may 
be carried forward indefinitely; and £105.5m (2010: £99.5m) relating to other categories. In accordance with the accounting policy in note 11.1, 
these items have not been recognised as deferred tax assets on the basis that their future economic benefit is not probable. In total, there was an 
increase of £0.7m (2010: £7.4m) in net unrecognised deferred tax assets during the year.
As at 31 December 2011, the Group had total operating losses carried forward with a tax value of £236.0m (2010: £237.2m). This total includes 
£103.0m (2010: £97.8m) for losses which are available to offset future taxable US income, of which approximately £7.6m (2010: £7.6m) will expire 
in 2020 and the remainder will expire between 2022 and 2031. A further £101.5m (2010: £108.4m) of losses are available to offset future UK 
taxable income and may be carried forward without time limit. The remaining losses with a value of £31.5m (2010: £31.0m) include £15.5m (2010: 
£15.9m) which may be carried forward indefinitely and £11.8m (2010: £9.8m) which will expire within the next five years if not used. The balance 
of £4.2m (2010: £5.3m) has a maximum life of between five and twenty years. The amounts arise in a number of countries and are not individually 
significant, reflecting the spread of the Group’s operations. As at 31 December 2011, the Group had unrelieved interest with a tax value of £92.3m 
(2010: £92.4m), which may be carried forward indefinitely, and US tax credits carried forward with a tax value of £10.2m (2010: £10.1m), comprising 
£2.8m (2010: £2.7m) of research and experimentation credits, which expire between 2018 and 2031, and £7.4m (2010: £7.4m) of foreign tax credits 
expiring between 2014 and 2018.
Due to changes in UK tax law enacted in 2009 exempting dividends received from UK tax, the aggregate amount of temporary differences 
associated with investments in subsidiaries and interests in joint ventures for which deferred tax liabilities have not been recognised is £nil 
(2010: £nil).
From 1 April 2011, the UK corporation tax rate reduced from 28% to 26%. A further UK corporation tax rate reduction to 25% was substantially 
enacted on 5 July 2011 and will have effect from 1 April 2012.  It is the UK Government’s intention to enact legislation which will reduce the main 
rate of UK corporation tax to 23% by 2014, although this has not yet been substantively enacted under IFRS and UK GAAP .  Accordingly, the Group’s 
closing UK deferred tax liability has been provided using a tax rate of 25%. The impact of using this lower tax rate was to increase the exceptional 
tax credit relating to the amortisation of intangible assets from £5.0m to £7.2m.

For the purposes of calculating diluted basic and diluted headline EPS, the weighted average number of ordinary shares is adjusted to include 
the weighted average number of ordinary shares that would be issued on the conversion of all dilutive potential ordinary shares relating to the 
Company’s share-based payment plans. Potential ordinary shares are only treated as dilutive when their conversion to ordinary shares would 
decrease earnings per share, or increase loss per share, from continuing operations. 
In addition to the ordinary shares shown as being dilutive in the table above, the Company had 0.2m (2010: 0.5m) of outstanding options and 
share awards in relation to its share-based payment plans that could dilute EPS in the future, but which are not included in the calculation of 
diluted and diluted headline EPS above because they were anti-dilutive in the years presented. 20769-04  13/01/2012 Skeleton 2

16. PROPERTY , PLANT AND EQUIPMENT
16.1 ACCOUNTING POLICY 
Freehold land is carried at cost less accumulated impairment losses. Other items of property, plant and equipment are carried at cost less 
accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment losses. Costs are capitalised only when it is probable that they will result in future 
economic benefits flowing to the Group and when they can be measured reliably. All other repairs and maintenance expenditure is charged to 
the Group income statement in the period in which it is incurred.
Freehold land is not depreciated as it has an infinite life. Depreciation on other items of property, plant and equipment begins when the asset is 
available for use and is charged to the Group income statement on a straight-line basis so as to write off the cost less residual value of the asset 
over its estimated useful life as follows:
Asset category Estimated useful life
Freehold property between 10 and 50 years
Leasehold property the term of the lease
Plant and equipment — motor vehicles between 1 and 5 years
 — information technology equipment between 1 and 5 years
 — other between 5 and 15 years
The depreciation method used, residual values and estimated useful lives are reviewed and changed, if appropriate, at least at each financial 
year-end. Assets held under finance leases are depreciated over their expected useful lives on the same basis as owned assets or, where shorter, 
over the term of the relevant lease. As described in note 18.1, an asset’s carrying amount is immediately written down to its recoverable amount 
if its carrying amount is greater than its estimated recoverable amount. Gains and losses arising on disposals are determined by comparing sales 
proceeds with carrying amount and are recognised in the Group income statement. 20769-04  13/01/2012 Skeleton 2

17.  INTANGIBLE ASSETS
Intangible assets comprise goodwill and other intangible assets that have been acquired through business combinations.
17.1 ACCOUNTING POLICY
(a) Goodwill
Goodwill arising in a business combination is initially recognised as an asset at cost, measured as the excess of the aggregate of the acquisition-date 
fair value of the consideration transferred and the amount of any non-controlling interest acquired over the net of the acquisition-date fair value 
amounts of the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed. When the excess is negative, a bargain purchase gain is recognised immediately 
in profit or loss. Goodwill is subsequently measured at cost less accumulated impairment losses, with impairment testing carried out annually, or 
more frequently when there is an indication that the cash-generating unit to which the goodwill has been allocated may be impaired. On disposal of 
a business, the attributable amount of goodwill is included in the calculation of the profit or loss on disposal. 
(b) Other intangible assets
Intangible assets other than goodwill are recognised on business combinations if they are separable, or if they arise from contractual or other legal 
rights, and their value can be measured reliably. They are initially measured at cost, which is equal to the acquisition date fair value, and subsequently 
measured at cost less accumulated amortisation charges and accumulated impairment losses. Other intangible assets are subject to impairment 
testing when there is an indication that an impairment loss may have been incurred and are amortised over their estimated useful lives.

17.3  ANALYSIS OF GOODWILL BY CASH-GENERATING UNIT (“CGU”)
Goodwill acquired in a business combination is allocated to each of the Group’s CGUs expected to benefit from the synergies of the combination. 
For the purposes of impairment testing, the Directors consider that the Group has four CGUs: the Engineered Ceramics division, the Surface 
Chemistries and Joining Technologies product lines of the Performance Materials division and the Precious Metals Processing division. These 
CGUs represent the lowest level within the Group at which goodwill is monitored. The goodwill attributable to the Precious Metals Processing 
division CGU has been fully impaired and consequently the amount recognised in the Group balance sheet is £nil (2010: £nil).

18.  IMPAIRMENT OF TANGIBLE AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS
18.1  ACCOUNTING POLICY
At each balance sheet date, the Directors review the carrying value of the Group’s tangible and other intangible assets to determine whether 
there is any indication that those assets have suffered an impairment loss. If such indication exists, the recoverable amount of the asset is 
estimated in order to determine the extent, if any, of the impairment loss. Where it is not feasible to estimate the recoverable amount of an 
individual asset, the Directors estimate the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit (“CGU”) to which the asset belongs.
Goodwill acquired in a business combination is allocated to each of the Group’s CGUs expected to benefit from the synergies of the combination 
and the Directors carry out annual impairment testing of the carrying value of its CGUs, to assess the need for any impairment of the carrying 
value of goodwill and other intangible and tangible assets associated with these CGUs.
For the purpose of impairment testing, the recoverable amount of an asset or CGU is the higher of (i) its fair value less costs to sell and (ii) its value 
in use. If the recoverable amount of a CGU is less than the carrying amount of that CGU, the resulting impairment loss is allocated first to reduce 
the carrying amount of any goodwill allocated to the CGU and then to the other assets of the CGU pro rata on the basis of the carrying amount 
of each asset in the CGU. An impairment loss recognised for goodwill is not reversed in a subsequent period. An impairment loss recognised 
in a prior year for an asset other than goodwill may be reversed where there has been a change in the estimates used to measure the asset’s 
recoverable amount since the impairment loss was recognised. The value in use calculations of the Group’s CGUs are based on detailed business 
plans covering a three year period from the balance sheet date, higher level assumptions covering a further two year period and perpetuity 
calculations beyond this five year projection period. The cash flows in the calculations are discounted to their current value using pre-tax 
discount rates.
18.2  KEY ASSUMPTIONS
The key assumptions used in determining value in use are return on sales, return on net sales value, growth rates and discount rates. Return 
on sales and return on net sales value assumptions are based on historical financial information, adjusted to factor in the anticipated impact of 
restructuring and rationalisation plans already announced at the balance sheet date.
Growth rates are determined with reference to: current market conditions; external forecasts and historical trends for the Group’s key end-
markets of steel production, foundry castings and electronics; and expected growth in output within the industries in which each major Group 
business unit operates. A perpetuity growth rate of 2.5% (2010: 3%) has been applied based on the long-term growth rates experienced in the 
Group’s end-markets and external forecasts. The Group’s projections are based on historical trends and external forecasts.
Discount rates are calculated for each CGU, reflecting market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to each CGU. The pre-
tax discount rate used for the Engineered Ceramics CGU was 14.9% (2010: 14.5%), for the Surface Chemistries CGU 15.0% (2010: 14.1%) and for 
the Joining Technologies CGU 13.8% (2010: 12.5%).
18.3  GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT
In assessing goodwill for potential impairment as at 31 December 2011, the Directors made use of detailed calculations of the recoverable 
amount of the Group’s CGUs as at 31 December 2011. Those calculations resulted in recoverable amounts significantly higher than the carrying 
values of each of the Group’s CGUs and consequently no impairment charges were recognised.

19.  TRADE AND OTHER RECEIVABLES
19.1 ACCOUNTING POLICY
Trade and other receivables are initially recognised at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost, using the effective interest 
method, less impairment losses.

Total trade and other receivables 530.0 522.9
All of the Group’s operating companies have policies and procedures in place to assess the creditworthiness of the customers with whom they 
do business. Where objective evidence exists that a trade receivable balance may be impaired, provision is made for the difference between 
its carrying amount and the present value of the estimated cash that will be recovered. Evidence of impairment may include such factors as 
the customer being in breach of contract, or entering bankruptcy or financial reorganisation proceedings. Impairment provisions are assessed 
on an individual customer basis for all significant outstanding balances and collectively for all remaining balances, based upon historical loss 
experience. Historical experience has shown that the Group’s trade receivable provisions are maintained at levels that are sufficient to absorb 
actual bad debt write-offs, without being excessive.

19.3  MOVEMENTS ON IMPAIRMENT PROVISIONS (CONTINUED)
Impairment charges, write-offs and the reversal of unused amounts shown in the table above are charged or credited as appropriate within 
administration, selling and distribution costs in the Group income statement. Of the total provision for impairment of trade receivables at 
31 December 2011 of £27.7m (2010: £31.3m) shown in the table above, £22.8m (2010: £25.9m) related to balances that were impaired on an 
individual basis. The ageing analysis of these individually impaired balances is shown in the table below.

Due to the large number of customers that the Group transacts its business with, none of which represent a significant proportion of the total 
outstanding trade receivables balance, the Group is not exposed to any significant concentration of credit risk. There is no significant difference 
between the fair value of the Group’s trade and other receivable balances and the amount at which they are reported in the Group balance sheet.
20.  INVENTORIES
20.1 ACCOUNTING POLICY
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost (using the first in, first out method) and net realisable value. Cost comprises expenditure incurred 
in purchasing or manufacturing inventories together with all other costs directly incurred in bringing the inventory to its present location 
and condition and, where appropriate, attributable production overheads based on normal activity levels. Net realisable value represents the 
estimated selling price less all estimated costs of completion and costs to be incurred in marketing, selling and distribution. The amount of any 
write-down of inventories to net realisable value is recognised as an expense in the year in which the write-down occurs.

The cost of inventories recognised as an expense and included in cost of sales in the income statement during the year was £1,459.2m  
(2010: £1,263.7m).
As at 31 December 2011, in addition to the inventory recorded in the balance sheet, the Group held £362.8m (2010: £354.8m) of precious metals 
on consignment terms and £271.4m (2010: £168.6m) of precious metals on behalf of customers for processing. Cookson has entered into various 
precious metal consignment arrangements with precious metals consigning entities (the “Consignors”). The metal which the Group fabricates for 
its customers may be purchased by the Group from a Consignor and sold concurrently to the customer, or may be consigned and sold directly 
from a Consignor to the Group’s customers, with the Group charging customers only for the fabrication process. As the Consignors retain title 
and associated risks and rewards of ownership under these arrangements, the value of the physical metal so held is not recognised in the Group 
balance sheet. Consequently, the obligations in respect of the consigned metal are not recognised as a liability in the Group balance sheet. The 
utilisation of consigned precious metals is established practice in the precious metals industry.

21.  DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS
21.1 ACCOUNTING POLICY
The Group uses derivative financial instruments (“derivatives”) in the form of forward foreign currency contracts, forward commodity contracts 
and interest rate swaps to manage the effects of its exposure to foreign exchange risk , commodity price risk and interest rate risk. The way in 
which derivatives are used to manage the Group’s financial risk is detailed in note 27.
Derivatives are measured at fair value. The fair value of forward foreign currency contracts and forward commodity contracts is calculated using  
market prices at the balance sheet date. The fair value of an interest rate swap is the estimated amount that the Group would receive or pay to 
terminate the swap at the balance sheet date, taking into account current interest rates and the creditworthiness of the swap counterparty.
The method of recognising the gain or loss on remeasurement to fair value depends on whether the derivative is designated as a hedging 
instrument for hedge accounting purposes and, if so, the nature of the item being hedged. Strict conditions have to be satisfied in order to 
qualify for hedge accounting, including a determination both at inception of the hedge and on an ongoing basis that the hedge is expected 
to be highly effective in achieving offsetting changes in fair values or cash flows attributable to the hedged risk. The change in fair value of a 
derivative that is not designated as a hedging instrument for hedge accounting purposes is recognised within trading profit in the Group income 
statement. Wherever possible, the Group avoids the administrative burden of hedge accounting, and does not designate a derivative as a hedge 
when, in the absence of hedge accounting, the change in fair value of the hedged item is itself recognised within trading profit in the Group 
income statement in the same period as the change in fair value of the derivative. No derivatives are held for speculative purposes. 
Cash flow hedges 
The effective part of any gain or loss on a derivative that is designated as a cash flow hedge is recognised in other comprehensive income and 
presented in the hedging reserve in equity. The ineffective part of any gain or loss is recognised immediately within trading profit, or within 
finance costs in the case of interest rate swaps designated as cash flow hedges. When the transaction that was being hedged is realised and 
affects profit or loss, the cumulative gain or loss on the derivative is removed from the hedging reserve and recognised in the income statement 
in the same period.
Fair value hedges 
The change in fair value of a derivative that is designated as a fair value hedge is recognised within trading profit in the Group income statement. 
The carrying amount of the hedged item is adjusted by the change in its fair value that is attributable to the hedged risk and this adjustment is 
recognised within trading profit in the Group income statement.
Net investment hedges 
The effective part of any gain or loss on a derivative that is designated as a hedge of a net investment in a foreign operation, is recognised in 
other comprehensive income and presented in the translation reserve in equity and is subsequently recognised in the Group income statement 
as part of the profit or loss on disposal of the net investment. The ineffective portion of the gain or loss is recognised immediately within trading 
profit in the Group income statement.

the table above will mature within a year of the balance sheet date (2010: £14.1m within two years). The comparative data for 2010 shown in the 
table above has been reclassified from an analysis based upon the type of financial instrument, as it was presented in the 2010 annual report, to

21.  DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS (CONTINUED)
21.2  ANALYSIS OF DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS (CONTINUED)
(a)  Cash flow hedges
Cash flow hedges in the table above include: floating to fixed interest rate swaps that are used to manage the interest rate profile of the Group’s 
borrowings (note 27.2); forward foreign currency contracts used to hedge the currency risk in forecast sales; and forward purchase contracts used 
to hedge the cash flow risk relating to future sales arising from fluctuation in commodity metals prices.
(b)  Fair value hedges
Fair value hedges in the table above comprise forward sales contracts used to hedge the fair value risk relating to the balance sheet value of 
inventory arising from fluctuation in commodity metals prices.
(c)  Net investment hedges
Net investment hedges in the table above comprise forward foreign exchange contracts used to provide a hedge against the foreign exchange 
risk associated with the Group’s investments in its foreign operations. Of the change in the fair value of these contracts in the year, £10.7m (which 
was associated with the change in spot prices) was determined to be an effective hedge and was recognised in other comprehensive income and 
presented within translation reserves (note 24) and £4.0m (which was associated with the change in forward prices) was credited to the Group 
income statement within finance income.
(d)  Derivatives not designated for hedge accounting purposes
Other derivatives in the table above that are not designated for hedge accounting purposes comprise forward foreign exchange contracts 
used to hedge the change in fair value of the Group’s US Private Placement Loan Notes arising from fluctuation in exchange rates and forward 
purchase contracts used to hedge against the cash flow risk relating to future commodity metals purchases.

the Group’s Engineered Ceramics division, were both in the process of being disposed of and were classified as held for sale. 
An agreement was signed on 22 February 2012 with Richline Group, Inc. (“Richline”) for Richline to acquire the whole of the Group’s interest in its 
US Precious Metals business. Completion of the transaction, which is subject to a number of routine legal and regulatory conditions, is expected 
in the second quarter of 2012. The assets in the table above are stated after a write-down of £17.4m to bring their carrying value down to their 
estimated fair value less costs to sell. This write-down, together with a further £11.6m of redundancy and other costs incurred in preparing the 
business for sale, comprise the £29.0m loss on disposal referred to in note 9.

paid in October 2011.
A proposed final dividend for the year ended 31 December 2011 of £39.9m, equivalent to 14.5p per ordinary share, is subject to approval by 
shareholders at the Company’s Annual General Meeting and has not been included as a liability in these financial statements. If approved by 
shareholders, the dividend will be paid on 11 June 2012 to ordinary shareholders on the register at 4 May 2012. 
27.  FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT
27.1 ACCOUNTING POLICY
(a) Non-derivative financial instruments 
Loans and borrowings are initially recognised at fair value plus directly attributable transaction costs. After initial recognition they are measured at 
amortised cost, using the effective interest method.
(b) Foreign currencies
The individual financial statements of each Group entity are prepared in their functional currency, which is the currency of the primary economic 
environment in which that entity operates. For the purpose of the consolidated financial statements, the results and financial position of each 
entity are translated into pounds sterling, which is the presentational currency of the Group.
Reporting foreign currency transactions in functional currency
Transactions in currencies other than the entity’s functional currency (foreign currencies) are initially recorded at the rates of exchange prevailing 
on the dates of the transactions. At each subsequent balance sheet date:
(i) Foreign currency monetary items are retranslated at the rates prevailing at the balance sheet date. Exchange differences arising on the 
settlement or retranslation of monetary items are recognised in the Group income statement; and
(ii) Non-monetary items measured at historical cost in a foreign currency are not retranslated.
Translation from functional currency to presentational currency
When the functional currency of a Group entity is different from the Group’s presentational currency (pounds sterling), its results and financial 
position are translated into the presentational currency as follows:
(i) Assets and liabilities are translated using exchange rates prevailing at the balance sheet date;
(ii)  Income and expense items are translated at average exchange rates for the year, except where the use of such average rates does not 
approximate the exchange rate at the date of a specific transaction, in which case the transaction rate is used; and
(iii)  All resulting exchange differences are recognised in other comprehensive income and presented in the translation reserve in equity and 
are reclassified to profit or loss in the period in which the foreign operation is disposed.
Net investment in foreign operations
Exchange differences arising on a monetary item that forms part of a reporting entity’s net investment in a foreign operation are initially 
recognised in other comprehensive income and presented in the translation reserve in equity and reclassified to profit or loss on disposal of the 
net investment.

27.  FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT (CONTINUED)
27.2  FINANCIAL RISK FACTORS
The Group’s treasury department, acting in accordance with policies approved by the Board, is principally responsible for managing the financial 
risks faced by the Group. The Group’s activities expose it to a variety of financial risks, the most significant of which are market risk and liquidity 
risk.
(a)  Market risk
Market risk is the risk that either the fair values or the cash flows of the Group’s financial instruments may fluctuate because of changes in market 
prices.  The Group is principally exposed to market risk through fluctuations in exchange rates (“currency risk”) and interest rates (“interest rate 
risk”).
Currency risk
The Group is exposed to currency risk on its borrowings and financial assets (being cash and short-term deposits) that are denominated in 
currencies other than pounds sterling. The Group’s general policy is proportionally to match the currency profile of its core borrowings with the 
currency profile of its earnings and net assets achieved, where necessary, by the use of forward foreign exchange contracts (“FX swaps”). The 
currency profile of the Group’s borrowings and financial assets, reflecting the effect of the FX swaps, is shown in the table below.

Based upon the currency profile shown in the table above, while not impacting reported profit, the change in net debt arising from a 10% 
strengthening of sterling would increase reported equity by £14.6m (2010: £16.6m) and a corresponding 10% weakening of sterling would 
reduce equity by £17.8m (2010: £20.3m).

Interest rate risk
The Group’s interest rate risk principally arises in relation to its borrowings. Where borrowings are held at floating rates of interest, fluctuations in 
interest rates expose the Group to variability in the cash flows associated with its interest payments and where borrowings are held at fixed rates 
of interest, fluctuations in interest rates expose the Group to changes in the fair value of its borrowings. The Group’s policy is to maintain a mix of 
fixed and floating rate borrowings, within certain parameters agreed from time to time by the Board, in order to optimise interest cost and reduce 
volatility in reported earnings.  
As at 31 December 2011, the Group had $440m (£283.7m) of US Private Placement Loan Notes outstanding, which carry a fixed rate of interest, 
representing just over half of the Group’s total borrowings outstanding at that date. The Group had also entered into floating to fixed interest 
rate swaps in order to increase the level of fixed rate borrowings to around two-thirds. The interest rate profile of the Group’s borrowings and net 
debt, reflecting the effect of these interest rate swaps, is detailed in the tables below.

27. FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT (CONTINUED)
27.2  FINANCIAL RISK FACTORS (CONTINUED)
The floating rate financial liabilities shown in the tables above bear interest at the inter-bank offered rate of the appropriate currency, plus a 
margin. The fixed rate financial liabilities of £357.0m (2010: £380.3m) have a weighted average interest rate of 5.4% (2010: 5.1%) and a weighted 
average period for which the rate is fixed of 3.7 years (2010: 4.5 years). The financial assets attract floating rate interest at the inter-bank offered 
rate of the appropriate currency, less a margin. 
Based upon the interest rate profile of the Group’s financial assets and liabilities shown in the tables above, a 1% increase in market interest rates 
would increase both the net finance costs charged in the Group income statement and the net interest paid in the Group statement of cash flows 
by £0.1m (2010: £0.5m decrease) and a 1% reduction in market interest rates would decrease both the net finance costs charged in the Group 
income statement and the net interest paid in the Group statement of cash flows by £0.1m (2010: £0.5m increase). Similarly, a 1% increase in 
market interest rates would result in a decrease of £10.9m (2010: £11.5m) in the fair value of the Group’s net debt and a 1% decrease in market 
interest rates would result in an increase of £11.7m (2010: £12.3m) in the fair value of the Group’s net debt.
(b)  Liquidity risk
Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group might have difficulties in meeting its financial obligations. The Group manages this risk by ensuring that 
it maintains sufficient levels of committed borrowing facilities and cash and cash equivalents to ensure that it can meet its operational cash flow 
requirements and any maturing financial liabilities, while at all times operating within its financial covenants. The level of operational headroom 
provided by the Group’s committed borrowing facilities is reviewed at least annually as part of the Group’s three year planning process. Where 
this process indicates a need for additional finance, this is normally addressed 12 to 18 months in advance by means of either additional 
committed bank facilities or raising finance in the capital markets.
As at 31 December 2011, the Group had committed borrowing facilities of £883.7m (2010: £855.4m), of which £339.5m (2010: £350.0m) were 
undrawn. These undrawn facilities are due to expire in April 2016. The Group’s borrowing requirements are met by US Private Placement Loan 
Notes (“USPP”) and a multi-currency committed syndicated bank facility of £600.0m (2010: £573.2m). The USPP facility was fully drawn as at  
31 December 2011 and amounted to £283.7m ($440.0m), of which $190.0m is repayable in May 2012, $110.0m in 2017, and $140.0m in 2020. The 
syndicated bank facility comprises a £600.0m revolving credit facility. The facility is repayable in April 2016.

Annual Report for the year ended 31 December 2011
27.  FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT (CONTINUED)
27.3  CAPITAL MANAGEMENT
The Group considers its capital to be equal to the sum of its total equity and net debt. It monitors its capital using a number of key performance 
indicators, including free cash flow, average working capital to sales ratios, net debt to EBITDA ratios, RONA and ROI (note 4). The Group’s 
objectives when managing its capital are:
` ` to ensure that the Group and all of its businesses are able to operate as going concerns and ensure that the Group operates within the 
financial covenants contained within its debt facilities;
` ` to maximise shareholder value through maintaining an appropriate balance between the Group’s equity and net debt;
` ` to have available the necessary financial resources to allow the Group to invest in areas that may deliver acceptable future returns to 
investors; and
` ` to maintain sufficient financial resources to mitigate against risks and unforeseen events.
The Group operated comfortably within the requirements of its debt covenants throughout the year and has substantial liquidity headroom 
within its committed debt facilities. Details of the Group’s covenant compliance and committed debt facilities can be found in the Financial 
Review on page 19. The Group has performance targets (page 2) that include maintaining a strong financial position with a year-end net debt to 
EBITDA ratio of not more than 1.5 times and dividend growth at least in line with earnings growth.
28.  EMPLOYEE BENEFITS
28.1  ACCOUNTING POLICY
The net surplus or net liability recognised in the Group balance sheet for the Group’s defined benefits plans is the present value of the defined 
benefit obligation at the balance sheet date as adjusted for unrecognised past service costs, less the fair value of the plan assets. The defined 
benefit obligation is calculated by independent actuaries using the projected unit credit method and by discounting the estimated future cash 
flows using interest rates on high quality corporate bonds that have terms to maturity approximating the terms of the related pension liability. 
Any asset recognised in respect of a surplus arising from this calculation is limited to the sum of unrecognised past service costs plus the present 
value of available refunds and reductions in future contributions to the plan.
The expense for the Group’s defined benefits plans is recognised in the Group income statement as shown in note 28.7. Actuarial gains and losses 
arising on the assets and liabilities of the plans are reported within the Group statement of comprehensive income; and gains and losses arising 
on settlements and curtailments are recognised in the Group income statement in the same line as the item that gave rise to the settlement or 
curtailment or, if material, separately reported as a component of profit from operations.
28.2  GROUP POST-RETIREMENT PLANS
The Group operates a number of pension plans around the world, both of the defined benefits and defined contribution type, and accounts for 
them in accordance with IAS 19.
(a)  Defined benefits pension plans
The Group’s principal defined benefits pension plans are in the UK and the US. The assets of these plans are held separately from the Group in 
trustee-administered funds. The trustees are required to act in the best interests of the plans’ beneficiaries. The Group also has defined benefits 
pension plans in other territories but, with the exception of those in Germany, these are not individually material in relation to the Group as 
a whole.
The Group’s main defined benefits pension plan in the UK (“the UK Plan”) is closed to new members and to future benefit accrual. A full actuarial 
valuation of the UK Plan is carried out every three years by an independent actuary for the UK Plan Trustee and the last full valuation was carried 
out as at 31 December 2009. At that date, the market value of plan assets was £401.9m and this represented a funding level of 88% of the accrued 
plan benefits at the time of £456.4m. Calculated on a “buy-out” basis (using an estimation of the cost of buying out the UK Plan benefits with 
an insurance company), the liabilities at that date were £589.0m, representing a funding level of 68%. The Company and Trustee have agreed 
a schedule of contributions under which the Company is making “top-up” payments of £7.0m per annum until February 2016, targeted at 
eliminating the 2009 full actuarial valuation deficit in the UK Plan by that date. The level of “top-up” payments will be reviewed based on the UK 
Plan’s next triennial valuation as at 31 December 2012, which should be available in mid-2013.

28.  EMPLOYEE BENEFITS (CONTINUED)
28.2  GROUP POST-RETIREMENT PLANS (CONTINUED)
In July 2010 the UK Government announced that with effect from 1 January 2011 it would be changing the statutory index used for revaluing 
future pension benefits from the Retail Price Index (“RPI”) to the Consumer Price Index (“CPI”).  This change impacted the revaluation of benefits 
under the UK Plan.  The 2,900 deferred members of the UK Plan were therefore notified during the year that, from 1 January 2011, future 
increases in their accrued benefits would be calculated with reference to changes in CPI rather than RPI, as was previously the case. Increases in 
pensions in payment remain linked to changes in RPI, as specified by the Trust Deed of the UK Plan. 
In addition to notifying the deferred members of this change to the valuation of their accrued benefits, the Company offered those members the 
opportunity to transfer their benefits from the UK Plan at a valuation enhanced above that normally available, including the retention of RPI as a 
basis for the valuation of the members’ transfer values.  As at 31 December 2011, this enhanced transfer value offer was still open, with a total of 
276 members having so far accepted the offer, representing the removal of £37.3m of pension liabilities and £43.2m of pension assets from the 
Group balance sheet as at 31 December 2011.  
The revaluation of the liabilities representing deferred member benefits, using growth assumptions based on CPI rather than RPI, resulted in a 
reduction in the Group’s pension liabilities of £21.5m, such amount being recognised in the Group income statement as an exceptional credit, net 
of the cost of enhancing the transfer payments made to members who, by 31 December 2011, had transferred. When the Company’s enhanced 
transfer value offer closes in 2012, a further adjustment will be made to the Group’s balance sheet liabilities and an exceptional charge reported 
to recognise the cost of the enhancement relating to those deferred members who transfer their accrued benefits after 31 December 2011 under 
the Group’s offer.
The UK Plan operates a hedging strategy, using a combination of swaps and bonds, to mitigate the impact of interest rate and inflation rate 
movements on the value of its projected liabilities for meeting future pension payments (the UK Plan’s “economic liabilities”), the value of which is 
related more to interest rate and inflation rate swap yields than to corporate bond yields, upon which the discount rate used for IAS 19 valuation 
purposes is based. When the relationship between the relevant swap yields and corporate bond yields is stable, the UK Plan’s hedging strategy 
should deliver a broadly stable “funding ratio” (the ratio of plan assets to plan liabilities) not just in relation to the UK Plan’s economic liabilities, 
but also under an IAS 19 basis of valuation. As at 31 December 2011, the estimated funding position (incorporating the UK Plan’s economic 
liabilities) showed a funding ratio of 97%, with the IAS 19 valuation reflecting a funding ratio of 116%. This represents a valuation difference of 
£80m, reflecting the use of more prudent valuation assumptions for funding purposes. The Group continues to fund the UK Plan with reference 
to its economic funding position.
The Group has a number of defined benefits plans in the US, providing retirement benefits based on final salary or a fixed benefit. In addition, the 
Group’s US Retirement Security Plan has characteristics similar to defined contribution plans but with a minimum performance level guaranteed 
by the Group on the members’ accounts. The cash balance rate assumption in the table in note 28.3(b) refers to the assumed minimum 
guaranteed return on members’ accounts. The Retirement Security Plan and the Group’s other principal US defined benefits plans are closed to 
new members and also to future benefit accrual for existing members. Actuarial valuations of the US defined benefits pension plans are carried 
out every year and the last full valuation was carried out as at 31 December 2010. At that date the market value of the plan assets was £109.4m, 
representing a funding level of 65% of accrued plan benefits at that date (using the projected unit method of valuation) of £167.3m. Funding 
levels for the Group’s US defined benefits pension plans are normally based upon annual valuations carried out by independent qualified 
actuaries and are governed by US government regulations. 
The Group has a number of defined benefits pension arrangements in Germany which are unfunded, as is common practice in that country.
(b)  Defined contribution pension plans
The total expense for the Group’s defined contribution plans in the Group income statement amounted to £17.7m (2010: £15.7m) and represents 
the contributions payable for the year by the Group to the plans. 20769-04  13/01/2012 Skeleton 2

28.  EMPLOYEE BENEFITS (CONTINUED)
28.3  POST-RETIREMENT LIABILITY — VALUATION AND RISK MITIGATION 
The assumptions used in calculating the costs and obligations of the Group’s defined benefits pension plans, as detailed below, are set by the 
Directors after consultation with independent professionally qualified actuaries. 
(a)  Mortality assumptions
The mortality assumptions used in the actuarial valuations of the Group’s UK, US and German defined benefits pension liabilities are summarised 
in the table below and have been selected to reflect the characteristics and experience of the membership of those plans. 
For the UK Plan, the assumptions used have been derived from the Self-Administered Pension Schemes (“SAPS”) All table, with future longevity 
improvements in line with the “core” mortality improvement tables published in 2011 by the Continuous Mortality Investigation (“CMI”), with a 
long-term rate of improvement of 1.25% per annum. The latter CMI tables are expected to replace the use of the “Cohort” improvement factors 
widely used since 2002.  For the Group’s US plans, the assumptions used have been based on the standard RP2000CH mortality tables, projected 
64 years for non-pensioners and 33 years for pensioners using projection scale AA. The Group’s major plans in Germany have been valued using 
the Heubeck-Richttafeln 2005G mortality tables.

 — bonds 3.40 4.00 n/a 4.50 5.40 n/a
The discount rate used to determine the liabilities of the UK Plan for IAS 19 accounting purposes is required to be determined by reference to 
market yields on high quality corporate bonds. The UK discount rate in the above table is based on the annualised yield on the iBoxx over 15 year 
AA-rated sterling corporate bond index; the US discount rate is based on the equivalent iBoxx index for US domestic corporations; and the German 
discount rate is based on the yield on the iBoxx over 10 year euro corporates AA index. 
The assumptions for price inflation are set by reference to the difference between yields on longer-term conventional government bonds and 
index-linked bonds, except for CPI, for which no appropriate bonds exist, which is assumed to be 0.9pts lower than RPI-based inflation.
The expected asset return is the Company’s expectation at the valuation date of long-term asset returns: based on the “risk-free” yield available 
by following a buy and hold investment strategy in government bonds; with returns for other bonds and equities estimated based on observed 
historic long-term strategic risk premia. These assumptions do not take account of the relative valuation of markets or of market momentum.

The Company and the UK Plan Trustee have identified the major risks which could affect the value of the UK Plan’s economic liabilities compared 
to the value of its assets and the Trustee has taken action, as summarised below, to reduce the risk that the UK Plan’s economic liabilities would

An interest rate swap overlay is in place designed, together with the bond portfolio, to mitigate approximately 75% 
of the interest rate risk of the UK Plan liabilities as measured on an ongoing basis. Under these contracts the UK Plan 
receives a fixed rate of interest and pays out a variable rate of interest, based on the London Inter Bank Offered Rate. 
This is beneficial when long-term interest rates fall, significantly offsetting the corresponding increase in the value of 
the UK Plan’s economic liabilities. In December 2010 an interest rate swaption collar was transacted, designed to 
mitigate the remaining 25% of interest rate risk in the case of extreme market movements during the following 
three years. 
Inflation risk
The risk of inflation rising 
faster than expected, leading 
to an increase in the value of 
plan liabilities.
Inflation swaps are in place designed, together with the bond portfolio, to mitigate approximately 70% of the 
effective inflation risk of the UK Plan liabilities as measured on an ongoing basis. The UK Plan pays out a fixed rate 
of interest and receives payments indexed with actual inflation. This is beneficial when inflation increases faster 
than expected and significantly offsets the adverse impact on the funding ratio.
Investment risk
The risk of significant 
financial market falls, leading 
to a fall in the value of plan 
assets.
The UK Plan Trustee has migrated the UK Plan’s asset portfolio to its current allocation, excluding risk-mitigation 
derivatives, of 58% bonds and 21% in equities. This structure, together with its liability driven investment 
portfolio of financial derivative contracts, significantly reduces the risk that the UK Plan’s assets would fall 
materially relative to the value of its economic liabilities.
(d)  Sensitivity analysis of the impact of changes in key IAS 19 actuarial assumptions
The following table analyses, for the Group’s main UK, US and German pension plans, the theoretical estimated impact on plan liabilities resulting 
from changes to key actuarial assumptions used for IAS 19 valuation purposes, whilst holding all other assumptions constant. 
It should be noted that the investment strategy adopted by the UK Plan, details of which are given above, was designed to mitigate a significant 
majority of the interest rate and inflation risk related to the UK Plan’s economic liabilities. The stabilising impact of this strategy is not reflected in 
the following table.

28.4  DEFINED BENEFITS OBLIGATION
The liabilities of the Group’s defined benefits pension and other post-retirement plans for IAS 19 accounting purposes are measured by 
discounting the best estimate of the future cash flows to be paid out by the plans using the projected unit method, in which the calculation of 
plan liabilities makes allowance, where appropriate, for projected increases in benefit-related earnings.

The Group’ s pension plans in Germany are unfunded, as is common practice in that country, and accordingly there are no assets associated with these 
plans. In addition to the assets reported above, £4.1m (2010: £3.9m) of assets were held as at 31 December 2011 to fund certain non-qualified US pension 
plan obligations. These assets are not included within pension plan assets as they are available to satisfy creditors in the event of the winding-up of the 
Group company in which they are held and are reported as investments in the Group balance sheet. The actual return on all Group pension plan assets was 
£110.1m (2010: £63.5m).

(a)  UK Plan asset allocation
As at 31 December 2011, the UK Plan’s assets, excluding risk-mitigation derivatives, were allocated 21% in equities (2010: 20%); 58% in bonds 
(2010: 61%); 10% in global high yield and emerging market debt (2010: nil); and 11% in other investments (2010: 19%). In addition, the UK Plan 
holds a liability driven investment portfolio of financial derivative contracts which materially reduce the risk that the UK Plan’s assets would fall 
materially relative to the value of its economic liabilities. 
(b)  Defined benefit contributions in 2012
In 2012, the Group is expected to make aggregate contributions into its defined benefits pension and other post-retirement benefits plans of 
around £20m. 20769-04  13/01/2012 Skeleton 2

The total net credit of £8.2m (2010: £4.8m charge) recognised in the Group income statement in respect of the Group’s defined benefits pension

In arriving at profit before tax — within ordinary finance costs 34.3 36.3
 — within finance income (32.0) (32.7) 
Total net (credit)/charge (8.2) 4.8
The net gain relating to employee benefits plans of £15.2m in 2011 represents: (i) a £21.5m reduction in liabilities of the UK Plan arising from 
the use of the Consumer Price Index instead of the Retail Prices Index to value deferred pension benefits; (ii) the impact in 2011 on the UK Plan 
of £8.3m relating to the enhanced transfer value exercise currently under way; and (iii) a gain of £2.0m arising from the closure of two defined 
benefits pension plans in the Netherlands.
With effect from 31 July 2010, the UK Plan was closed to future benefit accrual. This closure, together with the closure of one of the remaining 
defined benefits plans in the US, resulted in the recognition of curtailment gains of £5.3m in 2010.

30.  TRADE AND OTHER PAYABLES
30.1  ACCOUNTING POLICY

Total current trade and other payables 409.4 425.7
There is no significant difference between the fair value of the Group’s trade and other payables balances and the amount at which they are 
reported in the Group balance sheet.
31. LEASES
31.1  ACCOUNTING POLICY
Leases are classified as finance leases whenever the terms of the lease transfer substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership to the lessee. 
All other leases are classified as operating leases. Rentals payable under operating leases are charged to the income statement on a straight-line 
basis over the term of the lease. Benefits received and receivable as an incentive to enter into an operating lease are also spread on a straight-line 
basis over the lease term.
31.2  OPERATING LEASE COMMITMENTS
2011
£m
2010
£m
The future aggregate minimum lease payments under non-cancellable operating leases are payable as follows:
Not later than one year 17.1 17.3
Later than one year and not later than five years 41.4 41.7
Later than five years 44.7 49.2
Total operating lease commitments 103.2 108.2
The Group’s property, plant and equipment assets are either purchased outright or held under lease contracts. Where the terms of the lease 
transfer substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of the asset to the Group, the asset is capitalised in the Group balance sheet and the 
corresponding liability to the lessor is recognised as a finance lease obligation. Where all the risks and rewards of ownership are not transferred 
to the Group, the lease is classified as an operating lease and neither the asset nor the corresponding liability to the lessor is recognised in the 
Group balance sheet. The net book value of the Group’s property, plant and equipment assets held under finance lease contracts at 31 December 
2011 and 31 December 2010 was not material.
The cost incurred by the Group in the year in respect of assets held under operating leases, all of which was charged within trading profit, 
amounted to £25.6m (2010: £25.6m).

32. PROVISIONS
32.1  ACCOUNTING POLICY
Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present obligation as a result of a past event and it is probable that the Group will be required to 
settle that obligation. Provisions are measured at the Directors’ best estimate of the expenditure required to settle the obligation at the balance 
sheet date. Where the effect of the time value of money is material, provisions are discounted using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects both 
the current market assessment of the time value of money and the specific risks associated with the obligation. Where discounting is used, the 
increase in the provision due to the passage of time is recognised as a finance cost.

As at 31 December 2011 38.1 31.5 11.0 80.6
Of the total provision balance as at 31 December 2011 of £80.6m (2010: £85.8m), £55.7m (2010: £53.2m) is recognised in the Group balance sheet 
within non-current liabilities and £24.9m (2010: £32.6m) within current liabilities.
The provision for disposal and closure costs includes the Directors’ current best estimate of the costs to be incurred both in the fulfilment of 
obligations incurred in connection with former Group businesses, resulting from either disposal or closure, together with those related to the 
demolition and clean-up of closed sites. The provision comprises amounts payable in respect of known or probable costs resulting both from 
legal or other regulatory requirements, or from third-party claims, including claims relating to product liability. As the settlement of many of the 
obligations for which provision is made is subject to legal or other regulatory process, the timing of the associated cash outflows is subject to 
some uncertainty, but the majority of the amounts provided are expected to be utilised over the next five years and the underlying estimates of 
costs are regularly updated to reflect changed circumstances with regard to individual matters. 
The provision for restructuring charges includes the costs of all of the Group’s initiatives to rationalise its operating activities. The balance of 
£31.5m as at 31 December 2011 comprises £24.4m in relation to onerous lease provisions in respect of leases terminating between two and 
seventeen years, and £7.1m in relation to future expenditure on restructuring initiatives which is expected to be paid out over the next two years.
Other provisions comprise amounts payable in respect of known or probable costs resulting both from legal or other regulatory requirements, or 
from third-party claims. As the settlement of many of the obligations for which provision is made is subject to legal or other regulatory process, 
the timing of the associated outflows is subject to some uncertainty, but the majority of the amounts provided are expected to be utilised over the 
next five years and the underlying estimates of costs are regularly updated to reflect changed circumstances with regard to individual matters. 
Where insurance cover exists for any of these known or probable costs, a related asset is recognised in the Group balance sheet only when its 
realisation is virtually certain. As at 31 December 2011, £8.3m (2010: £10.1m) was recorded in receivables in respect of associated insurance 
reimbursements, of which £6.3m (2010: £7.5m) is non-current. The amounts reported in the table above as charged to the Group income 
statement represent only that part of the total income statement charge reported as a movement on provisions. Other components of the charge, 
such as asset write-offs, are reported as a reduction in the carrying value of the relevant balance sheet item. 20769-04  13/01/2012 Skeleton 2

During the year, the Group acquired interests in subsidiaries and joint ventures for a total consideration of £13.2m, of which £12.8m was paid 
in cash and £0.4m is contingent upon future performance.  The fair value of net assets acquired was £3.0m (of which £2.3m was cash). Goodwill 
arising on these acquisitions amounted to £8.3m (note 17). The £11.3m disclosed in the Group statement of cash flows in respect of the 
acquisition of subsidiaries and joint ventures, net of cash acquired, comprised: £10.9m paid for current year acquisitions; £1.9m invested in joint 
ventures; £0.8m of deferred consideration paid in respect of prior year acquisitions; less £2.3m of cash acquired with current year acquisitions.
34.  OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS
In compliance with current reporting requirements, certain arrangements entered into by the Group in its normal course of business are not 
reported in the Group balance sheet. Of such arrangements, those considered material by the Directors include: inventory held either under 
precious metal consignment arrangements or on behalf of customers for processing (note 20); future lease payments in relation to assets used 
by the Group under non-cancellable operating leases (note 31); and trade receivable balances that have been subject to non-recourse factoring 
arrangements.
Under its non-recourse factoring arrangements, the Group sells trade receivables balances to a third-party factoring company in exchange for 
a cash payment from the factoring company, net of fees. All the risks and rewards of the trade receivables subject to these arrangements are 
transferred to the factoring company and, accordingly, the trade receivables are derecognised in the Group balance sheet. Such arrangements 
are used from time to time by the Group to manage the recovery of cash from its trade receivables. As at 31 December 2011, the Group balance 
sheet included £41.7m (2010: £39.4m) of cash that would otherwise have been reported as trade receivables if these arrangements were not in 
place. Factoring fees incurred during the year ended 31 December 2011, which are written off to the Group income statement within ordinary 
finance costs, amounted to £1.8m (2010: £1.5m).
35.  CONTINGENT LIABILITIES
Guarantees given by the Group under property leases of operations disposed of amounted to £4.1m (2010: £4.1m). Details of guarantees given 
by the Company, on behalf of the Group, are given in note 14 to the Company financial statements.
The Group has extensive international operations and is subject to various legal and regulatory regimes, including those covering taxation and 
environmental matters. Legal claims have been brought against certain Group companies by third parties alleging that persons have been 
harmed by exposure to hazardous materials used by those companies in the manufacture of industrial and consumer products, and further 
claims may be brought in the future. Certain of the Group’s subsidiaries are subject to lawsuits, predominantly in the US, relating to a small 
number of products containing asbestos manufactured prior to the acquisition of those subsidiaries by the Group. These suits usually also name 
many other product manufacturers. To date, the Group is not aware of there being any liability verdicts against any of these subsidiaries. A 
number of lawsuits have been withdrawn, dismissed or settled and the amount paid, including costs, in relation to this litigation has not had a 
material adverse effect on the Group’s financial position or results of operations. 
36.  PRINCIPAL SUBSIDIARIES AND JOINT VENTURES
Details of the principal subsidiaries and joint ventures of Cookson Group plc and the countries in which they are incorporated are given in note 5 
to the Company financial statements.
37.  RELATED PARTIES
All transactions with related parties are conducted on an arm’s length basis and in accordance with normal business terms. Transactions between 
related parties that are Group subsidiaries are eliminated on consolidation. 
38.  EVENTS AFTER THE BALANCE SHEET DATE
On 22 February 2012, the Group entered into an agreement to sell its US Precious Metals business, a part of its Precious Metals Processing 
division, to Richline Group, Inc., a subsidiary of Berkshire Hathaway Inc. Completion of the transaction is expected in the second quarter of 2012. 
As at 31 December 2011, the net assets of the US Precious Metals business were classified as held for sale in the Group balance sheet (note 22) 
and a loss on disposal of operations of £29.0m was reported in the Group income statement (note 9).

6.  DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS
6.1  ACCOUNTING POLICY
The Company uses derivative financial instruments in the form of forward foreign currency contracts and interest rate swaps to manage the 
effects of its exposure to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates and interest rates on its borrowings. In accordance with its treasury policy, the 
Company does not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading purposes. 
Derivative financial instruments are measured at fair value. The method of recognising the gain or loss on remeasurement to fair value depends 
on whether the derivative is designated as a hedging instrument and, if so, the nature of the item being hedged. 
The fair value of forward foreign currency contracts is calculated using quoted market prices at the balance sheet date. The fair value of interest 
rate swaps is the estimated amount that the Company would receive or pay to terminate the swap at the balance sheet date, taking into account 
current interest rates and the creditworthiness of the swap counterparties.
6.2  ANALYSIS OF DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS
Derivative financial instruments comprise forward foreign exchange contracts, where changes in fair value are recognised in the profit and loss 
account, and interest rate swaps, where changes in fair value are initially recognised in reserves. The fair values of the Company’s derivative 
financial instruments as at 31 December 2011 comprised an asset of £0.8m (2010: £nil), which is recognised within current assets, and a liability 
of £16.5m (2010: £30.8m), recognised within current liabilities (2010: £16.7m recognised within current liabilities, and £14.1m recognised within 
non-current liabilities). 20769-04  13/01/2012 Skeleton 2

Annual Report for the year ended 31 December 2011
7. INTEREST-BEARING BORROWINGS
7.1  ACCOUNTING POLICY
Interest-bearing borrowings are recorded at the proceeds received, net of direct issue costs. Finance charges and direct issue costs are accounted 
for on an accruals basis in the profit and loss account using the effective interest rate method.
7.2  BORROWING FACILITIES
As at 31 December 2011, the Company had committed borrowing facilities of £883.7m (2010: £855.4m), of which £339.5m (2010: £350.0m) were 
undrawn. These undrawn facilities are due to expire in April 2016.
The Company’s borrowing requirements are met by US Private Placement Loan Notes (“USPP”) and a multi-currency committed syndicated bank 
facility of £600.0m (2010: £573.2m). The USPP facility was fully drawn as at 31 December 2011 and amounted to £283.7m ($440.0m), of which 
$190.0m is repayable in May 2012, $110.0m in 2017 and $140.0m in 2020. The syndicated bank facility comprises a £600.0m revolving credit 
facility. The facility is repayable in April 2016.

The issued ordinary share capital of the Company as at 31 December 2011 and 1 January 2011 was 276.4m shares of £1 each (31 December 2010 
and 1 January 2010: 276.4m shares of £1 each).  Further information relating to the Company’s share capital is given in the Directors’ Report on 
page 34. 
10.  RESERVES
10.1 ACCOUNTING POLICY
(a) Taxation
Both current and deferred tax are calculated using tax rates and laws that have been enacted, or substantively enacted, by the balance 
sheet date.
Current tax payable is based on the taxable result for the year. Deferred taxation is recognised, without discounting, in respect of all timing 
differences that have originated, but not reversed, at the balance sheet date, with the exception that deferred taxation assets are only recognised 
if it is considered more likely than not that there will be suitable future profits from which the reversal of the underlying timing differences can be 
deducted. Provision is made for the tax that would arise on remittance of the retained earnings of overseas subsidiaries only to the extent that, at 
the balance sheet date, dividends have been accrued as receivable.
(b) Foreign currencies
Transactions in currencies other than the Company’s functional currency (foreign currencies) are initially recorded at the rates of exchange 
prevailing on the dates of the transactions. At each subsequent balance sheet date foreign currency monetary assets and liabilities are translated 
into sterling at rates prevailing at the balance sheet date. All exchange differences are taken to the profit and loss account. 20769-04  13/01/2012 Skeleton 2

Treasury shares
As at 31 December 2011, 1.2m ordinary shares of £1 each of the Company were held by Cookson Investments (Jersey) Limited, as Trustee of the 
Cookson Group Employee Share Ownership Plan (“ESOP”), with a nominal value of £1.2m, which were purchased at a gross cost of £7.8m. The 
purchase of these shares was financed by the Company out of borrowings included in the Company balance sheet as at 31 December 2011. The 
market value of these shares as at 31 December 2011 was £6.0m (2010: £1.5m). The Trustee of the ESOP has waived its rights to receive dividends 
on the shares held. The shares are held, as treasury shares, to meet obligations under the Company’s share-based payment plans as and when 
they arise at the discretion of the Company. 
As at 31 December 2011, options exercisable over the £1 ordinary shares and capable of being satisfied through new allotments of shares or 
through shares held by the Company’s ESOP were as follows:

Other reserves
Following the cancellation in 2006 of the Company’s deferred shares and share premium account and pursuant to an undertaking given to the 
High Court of Justice at the time of the cancellation, the Company created a special non-distributable reserve of £1,003.4m, which is reported 
within other reserves in the table above. This special reserve becomes distributable at such time when all external creditors of the Company as 
at 15 February 2006 have either been fully settled, or have agreed that this special reserve may be deemed distributable, or to the extent that 
additional share capital or share premium arises after 2006 as a result of an issue of new shares. The balance on this special reserve as at  
31 December 2011 was £741.4m (2010: £741.4m). The remaining balance on the Company’s other reserves of £13.1m (2010: £13.1m) relates to  
a dividend in specie from one of its subsidiaries, all of which was recognised as a non-distributable reserve.

12.  EMPLOYEE BENEFITS
12.1 ACCOUNTING POLICY
The amount charged to the profit and loss account represents the contributions payable to each plan for the year. Differences between 
contributions payable in the year and contributions actually paid are shown as either accruals or prepayments in the balance sheet.
The assets of the Company’s closed UK-wide defined benefits pension plan (“the UK Plan”) are held separately from those of the Company 
in an independently administered fund. The Company is unable to identify its share of the underlying assets and liabilities of the UK Plan on 
a consistent and reasonable basis and therefore, as required by FRS 17, Retirement Benefits, accounts for the UK Plan as if it were a defined 
contribution scheme.  
12.2  PENSION PLANS
The Company participates in the UK Plan, which provides benefits based on final pensionable salary and also to a UK-wide Group defined 
contribution pension plan. Details of these plans are given in note 28 to the consolidated financial statements. Costs charged in the year in 
respect of its contributions payable to the Group’s UK pension plans were £9.5m (2010: £4.4m).  20769-04  13/01/2012 Skeleton 2

Cookson Group plc  
Annual Report for the year ended 31 December 2011
13.  SHARE-BASED PAYMENTS
13.1  ACCOUNTING POLICY
The Company principally operates equity-settled share-based payment arrangements for its employees. Equity-settled share-based payments 
are measured at fair value at the date of grant. The fair value determined at the grant date takes account of the effect of market-based conditions, 
such as the Total Shareholder Return target upon which vesting for some of the awards is conditional, and is expensed on a straight-line basis over 
the vesting period with a corresponding increase in equity. The cumulative expense recognised is adjusted for the best estimate of the shares that 
will eventually vest and for the effect of other non market-based vesting conditions, such as growth in headline earnings per share, which are not 
included in the fair value determined at the date of grant. For grants with market-based conditions attaching to them, fair value is measured using 
a form of stochastic option pricing model. For all other grants, fair value is measured using the Black–Scholes model.
13.2  PROFIT AND LOSS ACCOUNT RECOGNITION
The Company operates a number of different share-based payment schemes, the main features of which are detailed on pages 42 to 45 of the 
Directors’ Remuneration Report. The total expense recognised in respect of share-based payments in the year was £2.9m (2010: £3.5m), of which 
£2.8m (2010: £3.5m) related to the Long-Term Incentive Plan (“LTIP”).

14.  CONTINGENT LIABILITIES
Where the Company enters into financial guarantee contracts to guarantee the indebtedness of other companies within its Group, the Company 
considers these to be insurance arrangements and accounts for them as such. In this respect, the Company treats the guarantee contract 
as a contingent liability until such time as it becomes probable that the Company will be required to make a payment under the guarantee. 
Guarantees provided by the Company as at 31 December 2011 in respect of the liabilities of its subsidiary companies amounted to £30.7m 
(2010: £40.8m), which includes guarantees under property leases of operations disposed of amounting to £4.1m (2010: £4.1m).
In addition, on behalf of its subsidiaries the Company has given guarantees to precious metals consignors amounting to £362.8m (2010: 
£354.8m), representing all of the value of precious metals held by its subsidiaries on consignment terms as at 31 December 2011. Further details 
of these consignment arrangements are given in note 20 to the consolidated financial statements.
Cookson has extensive international operations and is subject to various legal and regulatory regimes, including those covering taxation and 
environmental matters. Several of the Company’s subsidiaries are parties to legal proceedings, certain of which are insured claims arising in the 
ordinary course of the operations of the company involved, and are aware of a number of issues which are, or may be, the subject of dispute with 
tax authorities. While the outcome of litigation and other disputes can never be predicted with certainty, having regard to legal advice received 
and the insurance arrangements of the Company and its subsidiaries, the Directors believe that none of these matters will, either individually or 
in the aggregate, have a materially adverse effect on the Company’s financial condition or results of operations.
15.  RELATED PARTIES
All transactions with related parties are conducted on an arm’s length basis and in accordance with normal business terms. Transactions between 
related parties that are wholly owned Group subsidiaries are not disclosed in this note.   20769-04  13/01/2012 Skeleton 2

BOILER ROOM SCAMS
In recent years, many companies have become aware that their 
shareholders have received unsolicited phone calls or correspondence 
concerning investment matters. These are typically from overseas based 
“brokers” who target UK shareholders, offering to buy their shares or sell 
them what often turn out to be worthless or high risk shares in US or UK 
investments. These operations are commonly known as “boiler rooms” . 
Shareholders are advised to be very wary of any unsolicited advice, offers 
to buy shares at a discount or offers of free company reports. If you receive 
any unsolicited investment advice:
❯ ❯ Make sure you get the correct name of the person and organisation.
❯ ❯ Check that they are properly authorised by the FSA before getting 
involved by visiting www.fsa.gov.uk/fsaregister/ 
❯ ❯ Report the matter to the FSA by calling 0845 606 1234  
(or +44 20 7066 1000 from outside the UK).
❯ ❯ If the calls persist, hang up.
More detailed information on this can be found on the FSA website at:

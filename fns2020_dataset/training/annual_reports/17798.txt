ChAirmAn’s st Atement
Animalcare remains focused on three 
product groups: Licensed Veterinary 
Medicines, Companion Animal 
Identification and Animal Welfare Products; 
all sold through veterinary practices. The 
three areas of the business have performed 
well during the year; in particular the 
continued growth of Licensed Veterinary 
Medicines by 8.8% is very pleasing and 
follows a strong year in 2014.
Financial trading
Group revenues increased by 5.1% from 
£12.9m to £13.5m principally due to the 
growth in sales of Licensed Veterinary 
Medicines by £696k to £8.6m. This good 
performance has led to pre-tax profits 
increasing by 12.7% during the year and 
over 30% in the past two years. Basic 
earnings per share have increased from 
10.3p to 12.1p, up 17.5% in the period and 
33% in the past two years. Cash generation 
has remained very strong, with cash 
increasing from £3.8m to £5.8m.
People
The senior management of your business 
has been further strengthened during the 
year with high calibre individuals from 
the human and animal pharmaceutical 
industry. A Senior Management Team 
meeting made up of all the heads of 
departments is chaired monthly by our 
CEO Iain Menneer, setting and monitoring 
budgets, and running the business  
day-to-day. 
The plc Board, which meets eight times a 
year, is chaired by myself as Non-Executive 
Chairman, having held CEO and Chairman 
roles for thirty years. Nick Downshire also 
has wide business experience and is a 
qualified accountant and chairs the Audit 
Committee. Ray Harding is a qualified 
veterinary surgeon and set up and ran 
a successful pharmaceutical regulatory 
consultancy for fifteen years and is 
Chairman of the Remuneration and the 
Nomination Committees. Along with the 
CEO and CFO your Board sets the strategy 
to enhance shareholder value in all three 
main operating areas of the business.  
I believe the success and the long-term 
growth of Animalcare are well served by  
a stable, experienced, well balanced  
and challenging Board. This coupled 
with an able, talented hard working 
management team gives your Company 
real opportunity for continued growth over 
the coming years.
Product development Pipeline
Progress has been made during the period 
developing new products in our in-house 
development pipeline. Our investment in 
product development and in regulatory 
assessment fees has grown significantly 
during the year to almost £800k, an area 
which is core to our growth strategy. 
Further information is available on pages 8 
and 9.
dividend
Your Board proposes, subject to 
shareholder approval, an increased final 
dividend of 4.3 pence per share. With 
1.8 pence per share paid as the interim 
dividend this brings the total for the year to 
6.1 pence per share, representing growth 
of 10.9% (2014: 5.5 pence per share), 
which is in line with underlying operating 
profit and is well covered by the increase in 
cash balances.
Prospects
With the significant increase in investment 
in new product development and in 
the infrastructure across all areas of its 
business, Animalcare is well positioned 
and delivering its strategy for growth in 
sales from 2017 onwards. Your Company 
possesses not only an experienced, 
talented and well balanced leadership 
team but also a capable hard working 
workforce. I would like to thank them all for 
their commitment during the year, which 
continues to deliver an exciting growing 
business.

l icensed Veterinary medicines
Market Overview
Total UK veterinary medicines market is worth 
£610m, of which £332m is for companion 
animals (dogs, cats, horses and small mammals). 
In the year to March 2015 the whole medicines 
market grew by 1.5% and 1.1% for companion 
animals (www.noah.co.uk). 
Operational Achievements
 » Successful launch of 5 new products in the 
period
 » Focus on anaesthetics and analgesics range 
has driven market penetration for these key 
products
 » Product development pipeline has gained 
momentum
Companion Animal identification
Market Overview
Annual UK sales volume currently estimated 
to be approximately 960,000 microchips for 
companion animals (excluding equine). Two 
main microchip database providers servicing 
the UK (The Kennel Club’s Petlog ~7.7m pets, 
Animalcare’s Anibase ~4.2m pets), with several 
much smaller operators.
Operational Achievements
 » Volume of Identichip units sold increased by 
1.7% in the period
 » Operational efficiencies implemented in pet 
owner database during the year offering cost 
savings whilst maintaining service levels
 » New microchip launched just after the year 
end offering slimmer form factor for smaller 
pets but without losing all the performance 
features
Animal Welfare Products
Market Overview
This grouping covers a wide range of products 
and consequently suppliers. Accessing the 
veterinary market through different channels 
for example established veterinary and human 
healthcare wholesalers, internet providers and ad 
hoc local suppliers. Accordingly this fragmented 
market is very hard to quantify with any certainty.
Operational Achievements
 » Infusion Accessories range continuing to grow
 » Preparations nearing completion for our 
hygiene range ahead of implementation of 
stringent EU Biocides Regulations

In recent years UK veterinary practices have 
consolidated; be it by corporate acquisition 
or joint-venture partnership, joining buying 
groups and growth of the charitable sector.
The veterinary pharmaceutical sector 
has seen increased competition through 
numbers of suppliers and generic products.
Conversely, in part through M & A activity, 
there are now fewer high quality routes to 
market for those pharmaceutical licence 
holders without domestic sales channels.
We have developed our internal capability, 
expertise and cash position to take 
advantage of these market conditions and 
opportunities to focus our strategy in the 
following areas.
our strategy for 2015 to 2018 is to:
1
  identify product candidates to 
maintain flow into and through 
development pipeline
2
  increase efforts to license in 
new pharmaceutical products
3
  Assess opportunities to

introduction
I am very pleased to report increased 
sales for the business during a period of 
investment. Revenues have grown in the 
period by 5.1% to £13.5m (2014: £12.8m). 
During the last two years we have been 
building a business that provides a strong 
platform from which to launch a new 
period of growth. This has been based on 
bringing together the best team possible 
and giving them the right environment 
to deliver our key strategic objectives. I 
am very happy with the progress we are 
making to deliver that growth.
Business r eview
The veterinary market continues to evolve, 
presenting new opportunities to work 
differently with a customer base that is 
consolidating and looking for increasing 
value from the products and services we 
provide. 
Latest industry figures show that dog 
numbers in the UK have declined by 4.7% 
to 8.5m and cats by 6.8% to 7.4m (Pet Food 
Manufacturers’ Association, www.pfma.
co.uk), with this trend appearing to reflect 
across other pet species too. There are 
no clear reasons for this change at a time 
when the economy is getting stronger in 
the UK after several years of recession. The 
national dog and cat charities believe these 
changes are as a result of their campaigns 
promoting responsible pet ownership. 
We believe we have limited exposure to 
these changes in pet population due to the 
clinical nature of our product portfolio and 
the demographic of veterinary customers 
likely to have been affected by changes in 
pet ownership. 
l icensed Veterinary medicines
The Licensed Veterinary Medicines group 
again generated strong sales, growing by 
8.8%. During the first half of the period the 
main competitor to our product Buprecare 
(an analgesic and controlled drug) was 
absent from the market for a period of 
several months allowing Animalcare to 
benefit from non-recurring sales estimated 
at £0.2m. 
In the first half of the year we launched 
the Pet Remedy range of over the counter 
products on distribution in the UK and 
Ireland. Pet Remedy is based on a patented 
formulation containing valerian at a specific 
level to calm pets. It can be used across all 
species and has proved very popular and 
effective in many domestic and veterinary 
settings. 
During the second half we launched four 
new pharmaceutical products, all on 
distribution from an EU partner. Synthadon 
and Anaestamine both complemented 
our growing anaesthetic and analgesic 
range; Clavubactin and Fungiconazole 
are an antibiotic and antifungal product 
respectively. All are focused on the 
companion animal market. Whilst in the 
first few months of their launch phase, 
sales of each are progressing well.
Encouragingly, our pharmaceutical 
products are growing above market rates 
in comparison to the most recent UK 
market data which show a 1.1% increase 
for companion animal medicines revenues 
in the 12 months to March 2015 (National 
Office of Animal Health, www.noah.co.uk).
“I am very pleased 
to report that 
good progress 
has been made 
in our product 
development 
pipeline.”
iain menneer Chief Executive Officer

Companion Animal identification
The sales volume of our Identichip 
microchips increased in the period by 1.7%, 
however UK revenues decreased by 2.2%, 
like for like. A significant equine order 
fulfilled late in the prior period adversely 
affected revenues from the equine channel 
in this reporting period.
In April 2016 it will be a legal requirement 
for all dogs in England to be microchipped 
and in addition it will be an offence if the 
owners’ details are not kept up to date on 
the associated microchip database. The 
Scottish Parliament and Welsh Assembly 
have recently followed suit in introducing 
similar legislation, effective April 2016.
This impending change in the law has not 
had a dramatic effect on the uptake of 
microchipping. However, our veterinary 
customers have become more price 
sensitive and responsive to short-term 
promotional campaigns. We have plans 
underway to bring value back into the 
market once it settles down.
Pleasingly through this period our revenues 
from services derived from the microchip 
database have continued to rise.
Animal Welfare Products
The Animal Welfare Products group grew by 
2.6% in the period. The infusion accessories 
range complements our prescription 
medicine intravenous fluids range and grew 
in the period by 5.3%, representing over 
50% of the product group. Other categories 
in this group achieved revenues meeting 
our expectations with very modest levels of 
commercial support.
As stated before, we continue to assess our 
product portfolio not only to rationalise 
poor performing or lower margin items but 
to selectively invest in new opportunities 
that complement our existing ranges 
to enhance revenue growth and profit 
generation.
People
General
Animalcare is a great place to work and 
we pride ourselves on the positive and 
supportive culture. I have highlighted in 
previous reports that changes have been 
made to bring the personnel systems up to 
date and to a level befitting a company of 
its size and stature. I am very pleased that 
further progress has been made during the 
year to incentivise and reward colleagues 
better. Attention has now focused on staff 
engagement by improving company-wide 
communication and awareness raising. 
These efforts are having a positive effect in 
all areas of the business; and I am pleased 
that this year we have again experienced 
more staff promotions into new and 
responsible positions.
management
Senior management changes during the 
financial year have resulted in a stronger, 
more capable leadership team. Sarah 
McKenzie joined as Head of Marketing 
from a senior commercial position at Teva 
UK, the global generic pharmaceutical 
company. Sarah brings directly applicable 
skills and experience from some very 
similar dynamics in the human generics 
market.
More recently, Martin Gore, formerly 
of Novartis Animal Health’s leadership 
team in the UK, was appointed to a newly 
created position to focus on European 
development. Martin has a wealth of 
commercial skills gained in the animal 
and human health sector and has recent 
experience as a country manager in Ireland.
sales
During the period we have concluded 
the reorganisation of our sales team. It is 
divided into two regions addressing the 
north and south of the UK. A structure 
has been introduced to support sales 
management. This change allows 
us to reward and motivate senior 
representatives more effectively. Field sales 
have been supported by the successful 
introduction of a telesales team. The final 
development is the strengthening of our 
key account support necessitated by the 
increase in corporate and buying group 
customers. Structural changes have been 
complemented by significant investment 
in training and development of our 
sales team. It is our goal to better serve 
our customers’ changing requirements 
and build a team that is capable of fully 
exploiting the new products and services 
that our product pipeline will bring to 
market.
Product Pipeline
I am very pleased to report that good 
progress has been made in our product 
development pipeline. Development work 
has focused on identifying new product 
opportunities and also ways to significantly 
enhance the commercial potential of 
existing pharmaceutical products.
Four new and four existing product 
development projects reached the 
‘Regulatory’ stage of our pipeline (see page 
9), three being submitted to the authorities 
for assessment. One of these products 
has already been approved and will be 
launched to the UK market early in the 
second half of the current financial year. 
The other two are currently progressing 
through regulatory assessment successfully 
to date.

europe
Animalcare’s sales outside the UK have 
been broadly constant for several years, 
averaging 8% of total turnover. The growth 
in our home UK market has not been 
reflected in mainland Europe. Therefore 
one of Animalcare’s stated strategic 
objectives is to increase sales outside the 
UK and reach the potential that patently 
exists.
A major step forward was the creation of 
a new post with the sole responsibility to 
achieve this. As outlined above, Martin 
Gore was appointed Head of Export 
Development late in the period.
Martin will assess current distribution 
arrangements in existing territories, 
offering support and insight from our 
central technical and marketing functions 
as required. In addition he will also identify 
new territory and distribution partner 
opportunities. In doing so Martin will 
increase our exposure in Europe with the 
intention to stimulate more inward product 
opportunities too.

supply Chain
During the year our operations function 
has started a structured programme to 
manage the supply chain more robustly, 
including monitoring supplier performance 
and developing more informed forecasting 
models. It is believed that both of these 
elements will improve product supply and 
tighten control of stock levels.
o utlook
Over the past two financial years significant 
effort has been made to build a strong 
platform to launch into a new growth 
phase in Animalcare’s history. I believe 
the essential ingredients are now in place 
and are already delivering progress in key 
areas of sales, product development and 
European growth.
During the past six months significant 
progress has been made increasing 
networks and contacts in an effort to 
source products to acquire or in-license. 
Whilst still in the early stages, there 
are some exciting opportunities under 
discussion.
Our business is strongly cash generative 
giving us the necessary resources to invest 
significantly in our product pipeline. We 
will continue to invest in and develop our 
enthusiastic and committed Animalcare 
team who are at the core of everything  
we do.

Presentation of results
We present our financial results on 
two bases. Underlying results show the 
performance of the business before 
exceptional and other items since the 
Directors believe this provides a clearer 
understanding of business performance. 
IFRS results include these items to give the 
statutory results.
o verview
We delivered another solid performance 
during the financial year to 30
th
 June 2015, 
with underlying operating profit increasing 
by 11.0% compared with previous year to 
£3.1m. This reflects our strong operational 
performance, both in revenue and margin 
terms, while continuing to make the 
necessary investment in our business to 
support future growth.
Our balance sheet strength continues to 
build, with Group cash balances of £5.8m 
at 30
th
 June 2015. The Group’s consistent 
profitable growth has enabled us to 
generate the funds we need to invest in our 
product development pipeline, a key part 
of our organic growth strategy. 
Overall revenues grew by 5.1% to £13.5m 
(2014: £12.8m). Our Licensed Veterinary 
Medicines group, which represents 63% of 
total revenue, again delivered good growth 
of 8.8%, 5.5% of which is like-for-like 
growth. As we noted in our Interim Report 
dated 31st December 2014, this includes a 
circa £0.2m non-recurring first half benefit 
from sales of Buprecare as a result of 
supply issues with a competitor product. 
The remaining growth is largely driven by 
sales of recently launched new products.
The strong performance in Licensed 
Veterinary Medicines was offset by a 
decline in Companion Animal Identification 
sales, mostly due to the phasing of export 
equine chip sales. 
Our Animal Welfare Products group grew 
modestly driven by our growing infusion 
accessories range, which represents around 
50% of the £2.6m sales. 
Gross profit increased by 6.0% to £7.6m 
(2014: £7.1m). Our gross margins improved 
to 55.9% (2014: 55.4%), primarily due 
to the non-recurring Buprecare benefit 
noted above. Due to favourable sales 
mix, underlying gross margins remain 
comparable with the prior year.
The financial performance of each product 
group is reviewed in more detail within 
the Business Review section of the Chief 
Executive’s Review.
“The Group 
continues to make 
good progress 
which is reflected 
in our financial 
performance.”

Strategic Report
Our Performance 24171.04    21 October 2015 1:21 PM    Proof 10
Underlying operating profit increased by 
11.0% to £3.1m and our operating margin 
improved by 120 basis points to 23% (2014: 
21.8%). Overheads, excluding research 
and development expenses, increased by 
£0.2m to £4.3m, as we continue to make 
the necessary investment, in particular in 
our management and support teams, to 
position the business for future growth. 
Research and development costs, which 
incorporate a share of the salaries of 
the product development team, have 
decreased by £0.1m against last year, 
reflecting the largely capital nature of the 
overall spend on our product pipeline. 
Non-underlying items principally 
incorporate the amortisation of acquired 
intangibles as detailed in note 4 on  
page 32. 
Reflecting all of the above, Group profit 
before tax was up 12.7% to £3.0m (2014: 
£2.7m). 
Cash flow
Our Group cash position grew by £2.0m 
to £5.8m as at 30
th
 June 2015. Cash 
generated by operations was very strong 
at £4.5m (2014: £1.6m). We have focused 
on optimising our stock position following 
the peak seen in FY14 which has, to date, 
delivered a reduction of £0.8m. This project 
continues to ensure we maintain the 
necessary focus on our supply chain and 
the resulting impact of streamlining our 
working capital. 
It is of primary importance that the Group 
reinvests the free cash in our business to 
support future growth and, as planned, 
during the year we have substantially 
increased our expenditure in our product 
development pipeline as shown in the 
chart below:

and Business Development teams. 
earnings per share (“ePs”)
Basic underlying EPS improved by 16.7% 
to 12.6 pence (2014: 10.8 pence). Basic 
EPS rose by 17.5% to 12.1 pence (2014: 
10.3 pence) reflecting the lower cost of 
exceptional items incurred during 2015. 
dividends
Since 2008 we have returned £5.5m to 
shareholders or 26.6 pence per share. 
This reflects the consistent and continuing 
strength of our operations, our balance 
sheet and cash position.
The Board is proposing a final dividend in 
respect of the year of 4.3 pence per share, 
giving a total dividend of 6.1 pence per 
share for 2015 (2014: 5.5 pence per share). 
This final dividend is subject to shareholder 
approval at the Annual General Meeting 
on 17
th
 November 2015 and will be paid 
on 27
th
 November 2015 to shareholders 
on the register at the close of business on 
23
rd
 October 2015. The Ordinary shares will 
become ex-dividend on 22
nd
 October 2015. 
The Board will continue to monitor 
the Group’s cash position to ensure an 
appropriate balance between investment 
for future growth and dividend flow to 
deliver overall value for our shareholders.
summary
The Group continues to make good 
progress which is reflected in our financial 
performance. We enter the 2016 financial 
year with a strong cash position, placing 
our business in an excellent position to take 
advantage of investment opportunities as 
and when they arise. Focused investment 
will continue, both within our employee 
base and product development pipeline, to 
deliver sustainable profitable growth in the 
coming years.

r isk description and potential impact mitigation trend
Product 
development 
risk
Pharmaceutical development is complex, 
involving technical, regulatory and financial 
risk. Failure to successfully deliver new product 
development projects could have a material 
impact on the Group’s results and damage 
our market position and relationship with our 
customers. 
Complete failure of a project or failure to meet 
commercial expectations due to for example 
competitor launches (generic or novel) would 
result in impairment of capitalised development 
costs. 
Following careful selection of development 
strategy, each new product development 
project undergoes rigorous review by the 
cross-discipline senior management team 
with final sign off by the Board. The pipeline 
is reviewed regularly, with corresponding 
updates provided to the Board, to ensure 
each project is progressing according to 
plan. External consultants, where deemed 
necessary, are employed to aid effective 
management of the development and 
regulatory process. 
the Group 
plans to 
commit 
significantly 
higher 
resources to 
expand our 
portfolio.
market risk The veterinary market continues to see a 
customer base that is consolidating via the 
emergence of buying groups and corporate 
customers who are looking for value from the 
products and services we provide. This presents 
an opportunity for growth but potentially at the 
expense of margins.
The reorganisation of the sales team 
completed in the financial year was in part 
driven by our strategy to strengthen key 
account support and achieve our goal to 
better serve our changing customer base. 
Our marketing offering is also evolving 
via more tailored propositions to further 
strengthen support to our sales team, 
veterinary practices and their customers. 
supply chain 
risk
The Group purchases goods for resale under 
contract manufacturer supply and distribution 
agreements. Any disruption to the relationship 
with our key supply partners or interruption to 
the supply chain could result in significant loss 
of Group revenue. Generally, it is not in the 
commercial interests of the Group to implement 
dual sourcing for finished product.
Supply chain risk mitigation strategies 
include close monitoring of supplier 
performance, dual sourcing of raw material 
and the maintenance of contingency stocks 
where appropriate.
People risk The Group has a small Executive and senior 
management team whose skills, knowledge, 
experience and performance make a large 
contribution to the success of the Group. Failure 
to retain and attract high calibre individuals 
could impact the successful implementation of 
our strategy. 
Succession planning for the Board is 
overseen by the Nomination Committee. 
Planning for key senior management 
positions is given consideration by the 
Board. Remuneration packages are reviewed 
annually to help ensure that the Group 
has the right mix of base salary, short-term 
and long-term incentives to attract, retain 
and reward key employees to execute our 
growth strategy.

The Directors present their Annual Report on the affairs of the 
Group together with the financial statements and auditor’s report 
for the year ended 30

Principal Activities

Business r eview and Future developments
A review of the business and future developments is provided 
in the Chairman’s Statement, Chief Executive’s Review and Chief 
Financial Officer’s Review.
r esearch and development
Our new product development programme is key to the future 
long-term growth and success of the Group and we are committed 
to the development of new and innovative products to meet the 
needs of our customers. Further information in relation to product 
development can be found in the Our Business and Strategy 
section of this report. During the year to 30
th
 June 2015 the 
Group incurred research and development expenses of £143,000 
(2014: £260,000) and a further £768,000 (2014: £156,000) was 
capitalised as development costs.

report.
Creditor Payment Policy
We endeavour to maintain strong trading relationships with our 
suppliers. Terms of payment are agreed with suppliers in advance 
and it is the Group’s policy to settle its liabilities in accordance 
with these terms. The number of days purchases included in trade 
creditors at 30

Corporate Governance
The Directors support the underlying principles of the UK 
Corporate Governance Code, notwithstanding that the Group is 
not required to comply with all of the Code’s recommendations. 
The Board recognises its overall responsibility for the Group’s 
systems of internal control and their effective operation and it 
has sought to comply with those provisions of the Code judged 
appropriate for the current size and nature of the Group, being the 
establishment of an audit committee, a remuneration committee 
and a nominations committee.
Formally constituted audit, remuneration and nominations 
committees, with membership comprising two of the Group’s 
three Non-Executive Directors, were established on the Group’s 
admission to AIM and are active in the conduct of internal financial 
control, Executive performance and remuneration and Board 
appointments respectively. 
Charitable and Political donations
During the year the Group made charitable donations of £325 
(2014: £100). No political donations were made during the year 
(2014: £nil).
employees
The Board recognises that the Group’s performance and success 
are directly related to our ability to attract, retain and motivate 
high calibre employees. We are committed to linking reward to 
business and individual performance, thereby giving employees 
the opportunity to share in the financial success of the Group. 
Employees are typically provided with financial incentives related 
to the performance of the Group in the form of annual bonuses. 
The Board also recognises employees for their contribution 
through the use of employee incentive plans and share plans 
within overall remuneration.
Applications for employment by disabled persons are given full 
and fair consideration. When existing employees become disabled 
every effort is made to provide continuing employment wherever 
possible.

Going Concern
The principal risks and uncertainties facing the Group are set out 
on page 15.
For the purposes of their assessment of the appropriateness of the 
preparation of the Group’s accounts on a going concern basis, the 
Directors have considered the current cash position and forecasts 
of future trading including working capital and investment 
requirements.
During the year the Group met its day-to-day general corporate 
and working capital requirements through existing cash resources. 
At 30
th
 June 2015 the Group had cash on hand of £5.8m (30
th
 June 
2014: £3.8m).
Overall, the Directors believe the Group is well placed to manage 
its business risks successfully and continue to be profitable and 
cash generative. The Group’s forecasts and projections, taking 
account of reasonable possible changes in trading performance, 
show that the Group should have sufficient cash resources to meet 
its requirements for at least the next 12 months. Accordingly, the 
adoption of the going concern basis in preparing the financial 
statements remains appropriate.
Auditor
Each of the persons who is a Director at the date of this Annual 
Report confirms that:
•	 So far as the Director is aware, there is no relevant audit 
information of which the Company’s auditor is unaware; and
•	 The Director has taken all the steps that he ought to have taken 
as a Director in order to make himself aware of any relevant 
audit information and to establish that the Group’s auditor is 
aware of that information.
This confirmation is given and should be interpreted in accordance 
with the provisions of s418 of the Companies Act 2006.
A resolution to re-appoint KPMG LLP as auditors and to authorise 
the Directors to determine their remuneration will be put to the 
members at the forthcoming Annual General Meeting.

stAtement o F dire Ctors’ r esPonsi Bilities
in respect of the Annual r eport and the Financial Statements for the year ended 30ᵗʰ June 2015
The Directors are responsible for preparing the Strategic Report, 
the Annual Report and the financial statements in accordance with 
applicable law and regulations. Company law requires the Directors 
to prepare Group and parent Company financial statements for 
each financial year. As required by the AIM Rules of the London 
Stock Exchange they are required to prepare the Group financial 
statements in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the EU and 
applicable law and have elected to prepare the parent Company 
financial statements on the same basis.
Under company law the Directors must not approve the financial 
statements unless they are satisfied that they give a true and fair 
view of the state of affairs of the Group and parent Company and 
of their profit or loss for that period. In preparing each of the 
Group and parent Company financial statements, the Directors are 
required to:
•	 select suitable accounting policies and then apply them 
consistently;
•	 make judgements and estimates that are reasonable and 
prudent;
•	 state whether they have been prepared in accordance with 
IFRSs as adopted by the EU; and
•	 prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis 
unless it is inappropriate to presume that the Group and the 
parent Company will continue in business
The Directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting 
records that are sufficient to show and explain the parent 
Company’s transactions and disclose with reasonable accuracy 
at any time the financial position of the parent Company and 
enable them to ensure that its financial statements comply with 
the Companies Act 2006. They have general responsibility for 
taking such steps as are reasonably open to them to safeguard the 
assets of the Group and to prevent and detect fraud and other 
irregularities.
The Directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity of 
the corporate and financial information included on the Company’s 
website. Legislation in the UK governing the preparation and 
dissemination of financial statements may differ from legislation in 
other jurisdictions.

1. General information
Animalcare Group plc (“the Company”) is a company incorporated in England and Wales under the Companies Act 2006 and is domiciled 
in the United Kingdom. The Group comprises Animalcare Group plc and its subsidiary, Animalcare Ltd. The nature of the Group’s 
operations and its principal activities are set out in note 5 and within the Directors’ Report.
The following new standards and amendments to standards are mandatory for the first time for financial periods beginning on or after  
1
st
 January 2014. Their effect has been limited to disclosure amendments.
IFRS 10: Consolidated Financial Statements
IAS 27: Separate Financial Statements
Amendments to IAS 32: Financial Instruments: Disclosures - Offsetting Financial Assets & Liabilities
Amendments to IAS 36: Recoverable Amount Disclosures for non-Financial Assets
The IASB and IFRIC have issued the following standards and interpretations, endorsed by the EU, with an effective date after the date of 
these financial statements. Their adoption, where applicable, is not expected to have a material effect on the financial statements of the 
Group.
International Financial Reporting Standards Applies to periods beginning after

2. significant Accounting Policies
Basis of preparation
The Group and Company financial statements have been prepared and approved by the Directors under the historical cost convention, 
except for the revaluation of certain financial instruments, in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (“IFRS”) as 
adopted by the European Union (“adopted IFRSs”) and the Companies Act 2006 as applicable to companies reporting under IFRS. They 
have also been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the AIM Rules.
Going concern
An analysis of the factors likely to impact on the Group’s future business activities, performance and strategy are set out in the Chief 
Executive’s Review and Chief Financial Officer’s Review. The principal risks and uncertainties facing the Group are set out in the Strategic 
Report on page 15.
For the purposes of their assessment of the appropriateness of the preparation of the Group’s accounts on a going concern basis, 
the Directors have considered the current cash position and forecasts of future trading including working capital and investment 
requirements.
During the year the Group met its day-to-day general corporate and working capital requirements through existing cash resources. At  
30
th
 June 2015 the Group had cash on hand of £5.8m (30
th
 June 2014: £3.8m).
Overall, the Directors believe the Group is well placed to manage its business risks successfully. The Group’s forecasts and projections, 
taking account of reasonable possible changes in trading performance, show that the Group should have sufficient cash resources to 
meet its requirements for at least the next 12 months. Accordingly, the adoption of the going concern basis in preparing the financial 
statements remains appropriate.
Basis of consolidation
The consolidated financial statements incorporate the financial statements of the Company and the entity controlled by the Company (its 
subsidiary) made up to 30
th
 June each year. Control is achieved where the Company has the power to govern the financial and operating 
policies of an investee entity so as to obtain benefits from its activities.
The results of a subsidiary acquired or disposed of during the year are included in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income 
from the effective date of acquisition or up to the effective date of disposal, as appropriate.
26 24171.04    21 October 2015 1:21 PM    Proof 10
Where necessary, adjustments are made to the financial statements of the subsidiary to bring the accounting policies used into line with 
those used by the Group.
All intra-Group transactions, balances, income and expenses are eliminated on consolidation.
Exceptional and other items
Exceptional items are material items of income or expense which, because of their nature and the expected frequency of the events 
giving rise to them, merit separate disclosure.
Other items relate to the amortisation of acquired intangible assets and fair value movements on foreign exchange hedging.
The separate presentation of exceptional and other items enables the users of the accounts to better understand the elements of trading 
performance during the year and hence to better assess trends in that performance.
Goodwill
Goodwill arising on consolidation represents the excess of the cost of acquisition over the Group’s interest in the fair value of the 
identifiable assets and liabilities of a subsidiary, associate or jointly controlled entity at the date of acquisition. Goodwill is initially 
recognised as an asset at cost and is subsequently measured at cost less any accumulated impairment losses. Goodwill which is 
recognised as an asset is reviewed for impairment at least annually. Any impairment is recognised immediately in comprehensive income 
and is not subsequently reversed.
For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill is allocated to each of the Group’s cash-generating units (“CGUs”) expected to benefit 
from the synergies of the combination. CGUs to which goodwill has been allocated are tested for impairment annually, or more frequently 
when there is an indication that the CGU may be impaired. If the recoverable amount of the CGU is less than its carrying amount, the 
impairment loss is allocated first to reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill allocated to the unit and then to the other assets of the 
CGU pro rata on the basis of the carrying amount of each asset in the CGU. An impairment loss recognised for goodwill is not reversed in 
a subsequent period.
On disposal of a subsidiary, associate or jointly controlled entity, the attributable amount of goodwill is included in the determination of 
the profit or loss on disposal.
Intangible assets
The Group recognises intangible assets at cost less accumulated amortisation and impairment losses. Intangible assets arise both as a 
result of applying IFRS 3 which requires the separate recognition of intangible assets from goodwill on all business combinations from 
1st January 2004, and from the purchase of software (that is separable from any associated hardware), and development machinery and 
from research and development (see below).
Intangible assets are amortised on a straight-line basis over their useful economic lives as follows:
Customer relationships 10 years
Brands 15 years
Software Estimated useful life, normally 2–4 years
New product development costs & marketing authorisations Estimated economic life, normally 5–7 years
Research and development costs
Expenditure on research activities, undertaken with the prospect of gaining new scientific or technical knowledge and understanding, is 
recognised as an expense in the year in which it is incurred.
An internally generated intangible asset arising from the Group’s new product development is recognised only if all of the following 
conditions are met:
•	 an asset is created that can be identified (such as a new pharmaceutical product);
•	 it is probable that the asset created will generate future economic benefits; and
•	 the development cost of the asset can be measured reliably.

Our Financials 24171.04    21 October 2015 1:21 PM    Proof 10
Internally generated intangible assets are amortised on a straight-line basis over their estimated economic lives. Where no internally 
generated intangible asset can be recognised, development expenditure is recognised as an expense in the year in which it is incurred.
Revenue recognition
Revenue is measured at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable and represents amounts receivable for goods and 
services provided in the normal course of business, net of discounts, VAT and other sales related taxes.
Revenue from the sale of goods is recognised when the risks and rewards of ownership are transferred which is generally when goods are 
delivered.
Income received in relation to long-term service contracts is deferred and subsequently recognised over the life of the relevant contracts. 
Further details are contained in note 21.
Interest income is accrued on a time basis, by reference to the principal outstanding and at the effective interest rate applicable, which is 
the rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash receipts through the expected life of the financial asset to that asset’s net carrying 
value.
Leasing
Leases are classified as finance leases whenever the terms of the lease transfer substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership to the 
lessee. All other leases are classified as operating leases.
The Group as lessee
Rentals payable under operating leases are charged to income on a straight-line basis over the term of the relevant lease.
Retirement benefit costs Payments to defined contribution retirement benefit schemes are charged as an expense as they fall due. 
Payments made to state-managed retirement benefit schemes are dealt with as payments to defined contribution schemes where the 
Group’s obligations under the schemes are equivalent to those arising in a defined contribution retirement benefit scheme.
Foreign currencies
In preparing the financial statements of the individual companies, transactions in currencies other than the entity’s functional currency 
(foreign currencies) are recorded at the rates of exchange prevailing on the dates of the transactions. At each balance sheet date, 
monetary assets and liabilities that are denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at the rates prevailing on the balance sheet 
date. Non-monetary items carried at fair value that are denominated in foreign currencies are translated at the rates prevailing at the 
date when the fair value was determined. Non-monetary items that are measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are not 
retranslated.
Exchange differences arising on the settlement of monetary items, and on the retranslation of monetary items, are included in 
comprehensive income for the year.
Segment reporting
An operating segment is a component of the Group that engages in business activities from which it may earn revenues and incur 
expenses, including revenues and expenses that relate to transaction with any of the Group’s other components. An operating segment’s 
operating results are reviewed regularly by the Board to make decisions about resources to be allocated to the segment and assess its 
performance, and for which discrete financial information is available.
Inventories
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Cost comprises direct materials and where applicable, direct labour 
costs and those overheads that have been incurred in bringing the inventories to their present location and condition. Cost is calculated 
using the first-in, first-out principle. Net realisable value represents the estimated selling price less all estimated costs of completion and 
costs to be incurred in marketing, selling and distribution.
Dividends
Dividends paid are recognised within the Statement of Changes in Equity only when an obligation to pay the dividend arises prior to the 
year end.

Share-based payments
The Group issues equity-settled share-based payments to certain employees. Equity-settled share-based payments are measured at fair 
value (excluding the effect of non market-based vesting conditions) at the date of grant. The fair value determined at the grant date of 
such equity-settled share-based payments is expensed on a straight-line basis over the vesting period, based on the Group’s estimate of 
shares that will eventually vest and adjusted for the effect of non market-based vesting conditions (with a corresponding movement in 
equity).
Fair value is measured by use of the Black–Scholes model. The expected life used in the model has been adjusted, based on 
management’s best estimate, for the effects of non-transferability, exercise restrictions, and behavioural considerations.
The fair value of the shares issued under the new Long Term Incentive Plan were valued on a discounted cash flow basis in conjunction 
with a third party valuation specialist. 
Taxation
The tax expense represents the sum of the tax currently payable and deferred tax.
The tax currently payable is based on taxable profit for the year. Taxable profit differs from net profit as reported in the statement of 
comprehensive income because it excludes items of income or expense that are taxable or deductible in other years and it further 
excludes items that are never taxable or deductible. The Group’s liability for current tax is calculated using tax rates that have been 
enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is the tax expected to be payable or recoverable on differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in the 
financial statements and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable profit, and is accounted for using the balance 
sheet liability method. Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised for all taxable temporary differences and deferred tax assets are 
recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available against which deductible temporary differences can be 
utilised. Such assets and liabilities are not recognised if the temporary difference arises from the initial recognition of goodwill or from 
the initial recognition (other than in a business combination) of other assets and liabilities in a transaction that affects neither the tax 
profit nor the accounting profit.
The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each balance sheet date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable 
that sufficient taxable profits will be available to allow all or part of the asset to be recovered.
Deferred tax is calculated at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period when the liability is settled or the asset is realised. 
Deferred tax is charged or credited in the statement of comprehensive income, except when it relates to items charged or credited 
directly to equity, in which case the deferred tax is also dealt with in equity.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to set off current tax assets against current tax 
liabilities and when they relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority and the Group intends to settle its current tax assets 
and liabilities on a net basis.
Property, plant and equipment
Land and buildings and other assets held for use in the production or supply of goods and services or for administrative purposes, fixtures 
and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and any recognised impairment loss.
Other than for land, which is not depreciated, depreciation is charged so as to write off the cost of assets, less their estimated residual 
value, over their estimated useful lives, as follows:
Straight-line
Leasehold improvements 10 years
Plant and equipment 4–7 years
Office furniture and equipment 3–5 years
The gain or loss arising on the disposal or retirement of an asset is determined as the difference between the net sales proceeds and the 
carrying amount of the asset and is recognised in the statement of comprehensive income as incurred.

Our Financials 24171.04    21 October 2015 1:21 PM    Proof 10
Provisions
Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present obligation as a result of a past event, and it is probable that the Group will 
be required to settle that obligation. Provisions are measured at the Directors’ best estimate of the expenditure required to settle the 
obligation outstanding at the balance sheet date, and are discounted to present value where the effect is material.
Impairment of tangible and intangible assets excluding goodwill
At each balance sheet date, the Group reviews the carrying amounts of its tangible and intangible assets to determine whether there 
is any indication that those assets have suffered an impairment loss. If any such indication exists, the recoverable amount of the asset 
is estimated in order to determine the extent of the impairment loss (if any). Where the asset does not generate cash flows that are 
independent from other assets, the Group estimates the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit (CGU) to which the asset 
belongs. An intangible asset with an indefinite useful life is tested for impairment annually and whenever there is an indication that the 
asset may be impaired.
Recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs to sell and value in use. In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows 
are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money 
and the risks specific to the asset for which the estimates of future cash flows have not been adjusted.
If the recoverable amount of an asset (CGU) is estimated to be less than its carrying amount, the carrying amount of the asset (CGU) is 
reduced to its recoverable amount. An impairment loss is recognised as an expense immediately.
Where an impairment loss subsequently reverses, the carrying amount of the asset (CGU) is increased to the revised estimate of its 
recoverable amount, but so that the increased carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined 
had no impairment loss been recognised for the asset (CGU) in prior years. A reversal of an impairment loss is recognised as income 
immediately.
Financial instruments
Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognised in the Group’s balance sheet when the Group becomes a party to the contractual 
provisions of the instrument.
Trade receivables
Trade receivables are measured at initial recognition at fair value, and are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective 
interest rate method. Appropriate allowances for estimated irrecoverable amounts are recognised in comprehensive income when there 
is objective evidence that the asset is impaired. The allowance recognised is measured as the difference between the asset’s carrying 
amount and the present value of estimated future cash flows discounted at the effective interest rate computed at initial recognition.
Investments
Investments in Group companies are stated at cost less provisions for impairment losses.
Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash on hand, deposits repayable on demand, and other short-term highly liquid investments that 
are readily convertible to a known amount of cash and are subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value.
Financial liabilities and equity
Financial liabilities and equity instruments are classified according to the substance of the contractual arrangements entered into. An 
equity instrument is any contract that evidences a residual interest in the assets of the Group after deducting all of its liabilities.
Trade payables
Trade payables are initially measured at fair value, and are subsequently measured at amortised cost, using the effective interest rate 
method.

3. Critical Accounting Judgements and Key sources of estimation Uncertainty
C r i t i c a lj u d g e m e n t si nap p l y i n gt h eGr o up ’ sa c c o un t i n gp o li c i es
In the process of applying the Group’s accounting policies, which are described in note 2, management has made the following 
judgements that have the most significant effect on the amounts recognised in the financial statements (apart from those involving 
estimations, which are dealt with below).
Capitalised new product development expenditure
It is the Group’s policy, where the relevant criteria of IAS 38 “Intangible Assets” are met, to capitalise new product development 
expenditure and to amortise this expenditure over the estimated economic life of the asset (product). Judgement is required when 
assessing the technical and commercial feasibility of new product development projects including whether regulatory approval will 
ultimately be achieved.
Capitalised software expenditure
The Group has historically capitalised software projects and developments. Expenditure on a bespoke web based system, designed to 
facilitate online ordering of its products and services, is currently capitalised in the Group’s financial statements as the Directors have 
adjudged it to meet the relevant criteria.
The rate of depreciation on capitalised software is set so as to reflect the pattern of usage and the level of pace of change within the 
global information technology market.
Key sources of estimation uncertainty
Impairment of non-current assets
Determining whether a non-current asset is impaired requires an estimation of the “value in use” and/or the “fair value less costs to 
sell” of the cash-generating units (“CGUs”) to which the non-current asset has been allocated. The value in use calculation requires an 
estimate of the future cash flows expected to arise from the CGU and a suitable discount rate in order to calculate present value. The key 
assumptions for these value in use calculations are those regarding discount rates, growth rates and expected changes to selling prices 
and direct costs. The Directors estimate discount rates using pre-tax rates that reflect current market assessments of the time value of 
money and the risks specific to the individual CGU. In the current year the Directors estimated the applicable rate to be 11.1% (2014: 
10.2%). The Directors’ sensitivity analysis indicates significant headroom to the carrying value of the CGU when taking into account a 
reasonably possible change in any one of the key assumptions used in the value in use calculations. 
The Group prepares cash flow forecasts derived from the most recent financial budgets and projections approved by management for 
the next five years, thereafter assuming an estimated growth rate of 2% (2014: 2%). The growth rates for the five year period are based 
on current performance of the existing product portfolio and the estimated contribution from the Group’s new product development 
pipeline. The Directors believe that the long-term growth rate does not exceed the average long-term growth rate for the UK economy.
Impairment of slow-moving and obsolete inventory
The Group performs regular stock holding reviews, in conjunction with sales and market information, to help determine any slow-moving 
or obsolete lines. Where identified, adequate provision is made in the financial statements for writing down or writing off the value of 
such lines in order to reflect the realisable value of its stock.

5. r evenue and o perating segments
IFRS 8 requires operating segments to be identified on the basis of internal reports about components of the Group that are regularly 
reviewed by the Chief Operating Decision Maker to allocate resources and assess performance. The Chief Operating Decision Maker is 
considered to be the Board of Directors of Animalcare Group plc. Performance assessment is primarily based on underlying operating 
profit and cash generation. 
The Group solely comprises one reportable segment, being Animalcare.

Long Term Incentive Plan (LTIP)
The Animalcare Group plc LTIP was introduced in June 2014 to provide an effective mechanism for senior executives to participate in the 
Company’s equity at a meaningful level, aligning their interests with those of shareholders. 
The Directors’ interests in the LTIP , which was implemented via a subscription for growth shares in the capital of Animalcare Ltd, a 
subsidiary of the Company, are as follows:
•	 Iain Menneer – 31,955 A Ordinary Shares of £1.00 each (“A Shares”) for a total cash subscription of £31,955, representing 5.2% of 
Animalcare Ltd’s issued share capital; and
•	 Chris Brewster – 19,173 A Shares, representing 3% of Animalcare Ltd’s issued share capital and 11,800 B Ordinary Shares of £1.00 each 
(“B Shares”), representing a further 2% of Animalcare Ltd’s issued share capital, for a total cash subscription of £30,973.

Dr Menneer and Mr Brewster have the right to sell their A Shares to the Company at any time after 27
th
 June 2017 in exchange for 
Ordinary Shares of 20 pence each in the Company (“Ordinary Shares”). The rights of Dr Menneer and Mr Brewster to sell their A Shares 
are subject to, amongst other provisions, the Company having a market capitalisation in excess of £39.0m (“the Hurdle”) at the time of 
sale. The Hurdle was determined by Animalcare’s Remuneration Committee and broadly represented a 20% premium to the Company’s 
market capitalisation on 27
th
 June 2014.
Each holder of A Shares would, on a sale of his entire holding to the Company, be entitled to receive Ordinary Shares representing a 
percentage of the increase in the Company’s market capitalisation above the Hurdle; being 5% for Dr Menneer and 3% for Mr Brewster.
The B Shares are not entitled to participate in any increase in the value of the Company above the Hurdle but can be exchanged for 
Ordinary Shares of an equal value at any time after 27
th
 June 2017.
Further details of the Plan, including the Hurdle, anti-dilution and other provisions, are set out in Animalcare Ltd’s articles of association, 
which is available within the Investors section (constitutional documents) of the Company’s website at http://www.animalcaregroup.

The carrying amount of Group goodwill is allocated to the Group’s sole cash-generating unit (“CGU”), being the Companion Animal 
segment.
The recoverable amount of goodwill is determined from value in use calculations.
The Group prepares cash flow forecasts derived from the most recent financial budgets and projections approved by management for the 
next five years and thereafter assuming an estimated long-term annual growth rate of 2.0% (2014: 2.0%).
The financial budgets and projections are based on past experience and actual operating results. The growth rates for the five year 
period are based on current performance of the existing product portfolio and the estimated contribution from the Group’s new product 
development pipeline. The Directors believe that the long-term growth rate does not exceed the average long-term growth rate for the 
UK economy, the principal geographic area in which Animalcare operates. 
The Directors estimate the discount rates using the post-tax rates that reflect the current market assessments of the time value of money 
and the risks specific to the cash-generating unit. In the current year the Directors estimated the applicable pre-tax rate to be 11.1% 
(2014: 10.2%).
The Directors modelled a range of different scenarios by applying sensitivities to both the cash flow assumptions and the discount rate. 
Based on this sensitivity analysis there is significant headroom between the value in use calculation and the carrying value of the CGU.

Credit risk
The Company’s principal financial assets are bank balances and cash, and trade and other receivables. The Company’s credit risk is 
primarily attributable to its trade receivables. The amounts presented in the balance sheet are net of allowances for doubtful receivables. 
An allowance for impairment is made where there is an identified loss event which, based on previous experience, is evidence of a 
reduction in the recoverability of the cash flows. The allowance for doubtful debts represents the difference between the carrying value 
of the specific trade receivables and the present value of the expected recoverable amount. The average credit period on sales of goods 
is 31 days (2014: 36 days). No interest has been charged on overdue receivables.

decrease in the exchange rate of these currencies against Sterling when applied to outstanding monetary items denominated in foreign 
currency as at 30
th
 June 2015. A positive number indicates that an increase in profit would arise from a 10% change in value of Sterling 
against these currencies, a negative number indicates that a decrease would arise.

21. deferred income
Deferred income arises from certain services sold by the Group’s subsidiary Animalcare Ltd. In return for a single up-front payment, 
Animalcare Ltd commits to a fixed term contract to provide certain database, pet reunification and other support services to customers. 
There is no contractual restriction on the amount of times the customer makes use of the service. At the commencement of the 
contract it is not possible to determine how many times the customer will make use of the services, nor does historical evidence provide 
indications of any future pattern of use. As such, income is recognised evenly over the term of the contract, currently eight years.

During the year the Group operated the Animalcare Group plc Executive Share Option Scheme, the Save As You Earn (SAYE) Share Option 
Scheme and the new Long Term Incentive Plan as described below:
Animalcare Group plc Executive Share Option Scheme
Under this scheme, options may be granted to certain Executives and senior employees of the Group to subscribe for new shares in 
the Company at a fixed price equal to the market value at the time of grant. The options are exercisable three years after the date of 
grant. Once vested, options must be exercised within six years of the date of grant. The exercise of these options is not subject to any 
performance criteria.
SAYE Option Scheme 
This scheme is open to all UK employees to encourage share ownership. Share options are granted at an option price fixed at a 20% 
discount to the market value at the start of the savings period. The SAYE options vest and are exercisable three years after the date of 
grant and must ordinarily be exercised within six months of the completion of the relevant savings period.

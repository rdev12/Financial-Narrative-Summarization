Chairman’s statement
H Jon Foulds
nOn-ExECUtivE ChAiRmAn
i am delighted that my last statement 
as Chairman of huntsworth should be an 
occasion when, once again, i can report 
record results for your group.
huntsworth is in robust health. not only 
are we showing record revenues and profits, 
we are also well positioned for an economic 
downturn. Operating margins are excellent, 
cash conversion consistently over 100%, debt 
is reducing fast and earn-outs – so often the 
bugbear of acquisition-led marketing services 
companies – fall away over the next three years.
i am proud of what we have achieved since 
2000 when we bought into this group which 
proved to be much weaker than we believed 
possible. Consequently we have had to build 
from scratch. And we have done that very 
successfully. w e now have one of the largest 
independent PR groups in the world with 
a growing specialisation in global healthcare 
communications. w e employ almost 1,900 
people in 70 offices worldwide and service 
over 3,000 clients.
w e now have one of the largest 
independent PR groups in the world 
with a growing specialisation in 
global healthcare communications  05 Huntsworth plc Annual report and accounts 2007
h owever, i am most proud of the management 
team we have assembled over the period. 
One of our senior independent directors 
commented the other day that these top 
managers were as strong as you could expect 
to find in a public company three or four 
times the size of huntsworth. 
i agree. i would only add that i believe that 
they will take h untsworth to those new 
heights – building on the foundations 
which we have established together.
my only disappointment is that our share 
price has not yet reflected the true value 
of the enterprise which we have built.
But i expect the younger management 
team who are increasingly taking over 
at the helm of your company will justify 
a much higher rating as the true value 
of our business is recognised.
And that younger leadership will be guided 
by my outstanding successor – Richard sharp 
– who will take over from me at the Agm 
in may. w e are all delighted that Richard, 
who has enjoyed a successful career at 
goldman sachs, is to join us. i wish him 
every success and i know that he will be 
supported loyally – as i have been – by some 
outstanding colleagues.
if a Chairman’s job is to leave the business 
in a better shape than when he arrived and 
to ensure that his successor is the very best 
candidate available, then i will leave this role 
with great confidence in may.
t hank you all – employees, clients, 
shareholders and suppliers – for your 
support over the last eight years.

Underlying basic earnings per share 07 Huntsworth plc Annual report and accounts 2007
it is often argued that in a recessionary 
period, PR spend will fall but independent 
mORi research predicts that more than 
half of Uk businesses with a PR budget will 
maintain their PR spend and one-third will 
increase it in 2008. Only 15% of respondents 
believe that they will cut their PR spend in 
2008. f urthermore, approximately half of 
the respondents believe PR to be a more 
effective tool than it was three years ago. 
f ull details of the poll are available on the 
huntsworth website. 
similarly, the survey of the l eaders’ Panel of 
the Public Relations Consultants Association 
('PRCA') which was published last month 
reported that 83% of PR agency mD’s 
believe their businesses will have strong 
trading in 2008.
group revenue grew in all geographies and 
disciplines during 2007. On a continuing 
basis, after allowing for acquisitions and the 
disposal of CapitalBridge, our largest client 
now represents just over 2% of total revenues; 
the top ten 16% and the top 25 clients 26%. 
t he group completed its strategy to 
divest non-core businesses with the sale 
of Broadstreet in 2007 and CapitalBridge 
in f ebruary 2008. 
in healthcare communications, the other 
main platform for our group, we are seeing 
a continuing shift from advertising, towards 
‘evidence based’ campaigns. huntsworth 
health companies specialise in this field, 
employing a high proportion of scientifically 
and medically qualified personnel. Coupled 
with increasing patient power and the 
explosion of digital media, we are confident 
that we are very well positioned for further 
success in healthcare communications in 
2008 and beyond.
Public relations
Reputation management, Corporate 
and social Responsibility ('CsR') and the 
Environment all played an important part 
in our 2007 growth. 
w ork in the public sector continued to 
expand with appointments such as the 
Department for Children, f amilies and 
schools for t he Red Consultancy. t he 
group’s integrated PR and Public Affairs 
offer in grayling organised programmes on 
obesity issues, the environment and organic 
foods which all drove revenues forward. 
Our corporate, financial and investor 
relations teams enjoyed a successful year. 
Citigate Dewe Rogerson won new clients 
and projects including l loyds Pharmacy, 
Abbey, h omeserve, l as alle investment 
management and Quorn. 
hudson sandler and Quiller continued to make 
good progress since coming together in 2006 
and were appointed by a number of major 
overseas groups to advise on their international 
communications including Russia’s leading 
petrochemical company , siBUR.
Our European network primarily under 
the t rimedia and mmd brands, provide 
the most comprehensive wholly-owned 
network in European public relations with 
over 650 staff in 29 countries. Eastern 
Europe showed double digit revenue 
growth during the year driven by high 
quality corporate and public affairs work 
with a particular focus on the energy, heavy 
industry and technology sectors. 
Our PR offices in Asia also delivered double 
digit like-for-like revenue growth where all 
of our offices made strong progress and 
continued to win blue chip clients.

Digital and On-line Communications
t here was an increasing demand in 2007 for 
our on-line services. Digital communications 
continues to underpin the effectiveness 
of our PR Programmes. w e estimate that 
more than half of our campaigns include 
a significant digital element.
Creative Excellence
Among numerous awards and accolades 
received across the group, Citigate Dewe 
Rogerson won the PR w eek Best f inancial 
services Campaign for the second year 
running for its work for AxA. t he Red 
Consultancy collected two sabres for Best 
f inancial services and Best w ebsite PR, and 
won Best Consumer Campaign at the CiPR

the PR w eek Awards. t rimedia triumphed 
in the first ever European Excellence Awards 
winning Best European Campaign as well 
as being placed for the second year running 
in the “sunday t imes 100 Best Companies 
t o w ork f or”.
Huntsworth Health
f or huntsworth health 2007 was a 
transformational year. Already operating 
successfully in Europe, the group established 
its n orth American platform with the 
acquisitions of both Dorland in march 
and Axis in july.
huntsworth health’s global offering now 
constitutes some 450 healthcare specialists 
operating across a breadth of communications 
disciplines, including analytics, marketing 
communications, medical communications, 
public relations and sales training. it operates 
a high science, high creativity approach to 
support healthcare clients worldwide. 
On its client roster, huntsworth health can 
already count products from 40 of the world’s 
50 largest pharmaceutical companies.
During 2007, our aim in healthcare has been 
to improve margins, particularly in the acquired 
companies. t his has been achieved with a 
67% growth in profits on a like-for-like basis. 
Network business
w e continue to increase our multi-country 
revenues with 29% of our business coming

The board and Management
huntsworth has made a number of changes 
to the group Board. Richard sharp has 
been appointed as Chairman of the Board 
with effect from the Agm in may 2008 
to succeed jon f oulds. Richard has an 
outstanding track record, most recently

Director, has been appointed group 
Chief Operating Officer, and will be 
responsible for maximising operational 
efficiencies, investor relations and corporate 
developments. t ymon Broadhead, Deputy 
f inance Director and Company secretary,

Both these Board appointments have 
immediate effect.
Outlook
2007 has been a very successful year for the 
group. t he business is now well balanced, 
tightly managed at every level and delivering 
solid organic growth and strong margins. 
65% of 2008 group revenues were 
committed at the beginning of the year, 
giving a high level of visibility for the current 
year. w e retain considerable flexibility 
to maintain margins through the proactive 
management of variable costs. staff bonuses 
account for circa 5% of revenues and other 
discretionary costs are about 7% of revenues. 
w ith variable costs of 12% of revenues, 
our new management team have flexibility 
to face any market downturn.
Our policy on acquisitions to complete and 
improve our network capabilities remains 
unchanged. w e will only acquire businesses 
where we see a long term strategic fit and clear 
opportunities for integration and improvement 
as part of our group. w e see no such 
opportunities in the market at this time.
w ith the progress that our brands 
have made across the world and with the 
appointment of Richard sharp as our new 
Chairman, the Board has confidence for 
2008 and beyond.

Chief Executive
The Red Consultancy
What if spartacus could have created 
a Facebook group?
The most famous scene in the 
Hollywood classic Spartacus sees the 
captured slaves all claiming to be the 
leader of the revolt. In turn, each one 
of them stands up and proclaims 
‘I’m Spartacus’ presenting a united 
front to their Roman oppressors. 
Of course, the result is all of them 
are executed alongside their leader 
as the Romans brutally suppress 
the renegades. 
In the modern democratic era of recent 
decades a Spartacus with a grievance 
would perhaps have written a letter to 
a newspaper, a government department 
or company head‑office. He would 
perhaps have been a lone voice and 
yes he may well – given enough time 
– have been able to create a 
grassroots campaign. 
Today a modern‑day Spartacus would 
use the internet. His cause or grievance, 
if widely shared, would quickly gather 
support as sympathisers rally to his blog, 
his website or Facebook page. 
Public relations has traditionally helped 
companies deal with the media, 
providing professional advice and 
strategy to promote or protect brands 
or businesses dealing with journalists. 
Now in what is being called the ‘citizen 
surge’ consumers can both challenge 
a business decision and compete with 
media for readership. Major stories are 
regularly broken on the internet. This is 
the world of social media. 
And this is where a new facet of public 
relations is rapidly emerging. One which 
helps companies to see and understand 
what is being written about them in the 
furthest reaches of the internet; which 
allows companies to engage with on‑line 
communities interested in their product 
or service giving these passionate 
consumers a platform to influence 
future developments. 
The watchword is dialogue. It’s about 
conversation not control. Many of 
the world’s leading companies have 
embraced this approach by launching 
CEO blogs. These are frank, informal 
web postings which give insight into 
how the business works and how its 
leader thinks. 
For the past few years, Huntsworth has 
been building expertise and experience 
in this field. At Shiny Red, The Red 
Consultancy’s stand‑alone new media 
operation, clients are offered monitoring 
of the internet, counsel on how to engage 
on‑line and creative strategic campaigns 
allowing them to work collaboratively 
with the internet community to launch 
products or services. 
This paradigm shift will spark strong 
demand for the dialogue‑based approach 
of PR versus the monologue‑tendencies 
of advertising. As the Romans themselves 
put it, it’s time to seize the day. 
Pr in the age 
of ‘Me’ media If bloggers are the new journalists – can PR still thrive? 13 Huntsworth plc Annual report and accounts 2007

huntsworth health
The healthcare marketplace touches 
everyone. It is the subject of constant 
change and has a dynamism that can at 
times be hard to predict. Even against 
that backdrop, almost all analysts report 
that 2008 will bring more debate and 
change than ever.
Huntsworth Health operates principally in 
the pharmaceutical, diagnostic and device 
markets. They are significantly regulated 
by government, and healthcare 
professionals play a major role in the 
choice of therapeutic interventions 
required. These dynamics affect both 
pharmaceutical companies and inevitably 
the communications sector which serves 
them. Analysts predict more difficult times 
ahead for pharmaceutical companies 
which will bring with it many significant 
opportunities and challenges in the 
communications area. 
In 2007 fewer new chemical entities were 
approved for launch than at any time 
in the past decade, but even license 
approval does not guarantee use either 
by governments or managed care 
organisations. Proof of clinical benefit is, 
therefore, both critical for getting a drug to 
market and imperative if it is to be used. 
As a result there has been a noticeable shift 
from overtly promotional activities – such as 
advertising – to a more ‘evidence‑based’ 
model of communication. This involves 
the increasing use of heavyweight clinical 
publications, scientific meetings and 
symposia in communicating with the 
market. A number of Huntsworth Health 
companies specialise in this field, employing 
a high proportion of scientifically and 
medically qualified personnel. 
The baby boomer generation have large 
disposable incomes, access to the internet 
and other mass media sources and, given 
their age, health is a major concern for them. 
They significantly influence the prescribing 
decisions of doctors and, as preventative 
options increase, so will consumer power . 
A key communication channel is public 
relations. Using our European and US PR 
networks, Huntsworth Health is able to put 
together global and European campaigns 
to cover key audiences.
Health is the most commonly searched 
topic on the internet, both by consumers 
and healthcare professionals and 
although we are still at the start of the 
digital revolution, its impact is already 
enormous. We have digital specialist 
agencies both in the US and in the 
UK and use digital technology in all 
Huntsworth Health companies to 
deliver programmes for clients.
The reduction in the approval of new 
chemical entities, the aggressive stance 
of the generic sector, coupled with 
downward price pressure from 
governments, has forced the industry 
to re‑examine how it does business. 
Whilst fewer ‘blockbuster’ drugs are 
expected, a significant increase in 
specialist medicines, ‘biologicals’ and 
sophisticated preventative interventions 
is predicted. The key to the success 
of these products will be rational and 
appropriate communication of relevant 
science – an area of particular strength 
of Huntsworth Health.
The healthcare market will continue to 
change and evolve. Huntsworth Health 
has developed its scope and capabilities to 
meet clients’ increasingly complex needs. 
We have a unique mix of scientifically 
qualified personnel, digital specialists 
and consumer expertise which places 
Huntsworth Health at the forefront of the 
healthcare communications revolution.
adapting strategies 
to integrated healthcare How is healthcare communication changing? 15 Huntsworth plc Annual report and accounts 2007
Huntsworth Health continued
h untsworth h ealth’s global offering now 
employs some 450 healthcare specialists 
operating across a breadth of communications 
disciplines, including analytics, marketing 
communications, medical communications, 
public relations, and sales training. it operates 
at the leading edge of science, strategy, and 
creativity to support leading healthcare clients 
worldwide, and can already count 40 of the 
world's 50 largest pharmaceutical companies 
as clients.
huntsworth health has a higher ratio of 
scientifically and medically qualified people 
than any other network and is uniquely 
“science centric”. in December 2007 
all companies within the group adopted 
a common huntsworth health branding 
platform. At the same time, each company 
retains its own identity, business focus, 
approach, and culture.
During 2007, the focus has been on 
improving margins to the huntsworth 
standard and we have seen a 66.8% growth 
in profits on a like-for-like basis as a result. 
margins improved from 10.5% in 2006 to 
20.6% in 2007. 
huntsworth health is well placed in 
2008 to take advantage of key factors 
in the marketplace; a shift towards 
niche, specialist brands that require 
evidence-based platforms plays strongly 
into our high-science, high-creativity focus. 
Coupled with increasing patient power and 
the explosion of digital media, we are very 
confident that we are very well positioned 
for further success in 2008 and beyond.
Digital and On-line Communications
w e saw increasing demand for our on-line 
activities which are now integral to the 
programmes we undertake for clients such 
as microsoft’s msn division, Diageo and 
the Uk government. Our new media

adding among others sky and Philips to 
its roster of clients. Citigate Cunningham in 
the Us have developed a lead in the mobile 
technology space with around 50% of the 
agency’s new clients engaged in mobile 
technology – from content performance 
testing to messaging services.
Creative Excellence
huntsworth is proud of the quality work that 
is produced across the group. Our agencies

Employees continued
The Group makes use of its intranet as a communication tool to provide employees with the information they need to understand and achieve the 
objectives of the Group as well as to encourage communication across the Group so that employees can share and benefit from experience and 
knowledge. Employees receive regular updates on corporate performance and business developments through various formal and informal channels. 
The Group operates a number of other policies and procedures designed to support its employees at work and in their career progression. Regular 
training sessions are held to keep staff up to date with developments in the public relations sector and provide additional skills in areas both within and 
outside their immediate responsibilities such as people management and leadership development, client management and international client director 
training. In addition, many group companies operate their own internal training programmes, and regular meetings are held between local management 
and employees to allow a free flow of information and ideas. 
To take a few examples:
  Trimedia International runs a senior executive development programme and international client director training as well as a ‘Talent Factory’ 
for consultants and account managers whereby participants from different countries work together on trans-national teams to a fictitious brief, 
overcoming linguistic and cultural divides to present their pitch to a panel of senior executives.
  In the US, Citigate Cunningham runs its own internal ‘university’, offering training courses for all levels of staff on a variety of topics relevant 
to their work.
Health and safety 
Due to the nature of the business, this is not a significant area of risk. However, the Group follows the recommended guidelines with regard to health 
and safety.
Environment
Due to the nature of its businesses, the Group does not have a high environmental impact. Its principal impact arises from energy, paper and 
water consumption. 
The Group recognises its responsibilities to conserve resources and is committed to continuous improvement in the environmental impact of its 
operations. The Group has an environmental policy that is designed to reduce wastage by raising employee awareness, encouraging participation 
and continual improvement through education and training in environmental matters. This commitment is also demonstrated by ensuring our 
environmental standards are reflected in our policy towards contractors and suppliers. 
Many of the Group’s business practices tend to support environmental good practice, such as minimising energy and water consumption, 
reducing paper wastage through reuse and recycling, using paper from sustainable forests, reducing business travel by replacing face to face 
meetings with conference calls or video-conferencing, using electricity generated from renewable sources, encouraging staff to switch off 
electronic appliances and to travel to work by foot, bike or public transport.
To take a few examples:
  In the UK, during 2007 the Corporate Head Office saved the equivalent of 63 trees and 6,900 kWh of energy (4,910 kg of paper and 10 kg of 
cans and plastic bottles) and Citigate Dewe Rogerson in London saved the equivalent of 329 trees and 105,300 kWh of energy (25,080 kg of 
paper). Citigate Dewe Rogerson in London worked with Cyclescheme with approximately 7% of its workforce taking part. In addition, T rimedia 
backed up its environmental policy with 32 environmental commitments and appointed an environmental champion in each of its offices to ensure 
compliance with those commitments and to drive forward key areas of improvement by engaging staff in environmental initiatives.
  In the US, Citigate Cunningham is a certified Green business in San Francisco following a series of audits which included evaluation of water 
and energy use, equipment, lighting and cleaning supplies. 
  In Europe, Trimedia Belgium encourages home-work travel efficiency and savings on carbon dioxide emissions by recommending staff to work 
from home in the event of heavy traffic in Brussels. 
Environmental performance will continue to be monitored and improvements made wherever possible. 
Community
The Group recognises its responsibility towards the communities in which its businesses operate. In support of our communities, a number of group 
businesses in the UK, the US and Europe organise fundraising and volunteering activities for staff to raise money for charity as well as offering pro 
bono support to non-profit projects. 
The Group is committed to building a culture which recognises its responsibilities to a wide range of stakeholders and which values accountability, 
transparency and disclosure. As a business that advises company boards, the Group is acutely aware of the importance of corporate responsibility, 
ethical behaviour and values in the creation and cultivation of corporate reputation. The Group recognises that it needs to maintain and operate 
to the highest standards. 24 Huntsworth plc Annual report and accounts 2007

Donations
During the year the Group made charitable donations of £49,000 (2006: £147,000).
The Political Parties, Elections and Referendums Act 2000 (the ‘Act’) requires disclosure of any donations made by companies to an 
EU Political Organisation (including a registered political party in the UK) or any EU Political Expenditure incurred which is in excess of £200. 
‘EU Political Organisation’ and ‘EU Political Expenditure’ are both defined in the Act.
Although the Company does not make donations to political parties within the normal meaning of that expression, as part of their normal work 
on behalf of clients and  as part of their own marketing, certain companies in the Group need to attend or sponsor events which are organised 
by political parties or other political organisations, for which a charge is made.
These companies also from time to time invite clients and prospective clients to attend events that fall within the meaning of the Act’s provisions. 
The Act defines ‘donations’ very broadly such that this sort of activity falls within its ambit. It similarly defines EU Political Organisation widely 
such that it includes, for example, bodies concerned with policy review and law reform, with representation of the business community or with 
the representation of their communities or special interest groups, which the companies may wish to support.
During the year, these Group companies made the following payments by way of sponsorship, attendance costs, or permitting staff paid time off 
to campaign in local elections in the United Kingdom that fall within the definition of ‘political donation’ introduced by the Political Parties, Elections 
and Referendums Act: £5,925 to the Labour Party, £15,015 to the Conservative Party, £60 to the Liberal Democrat Party and £824 to the Scottish 
National Party.
Payment of creditors
The Group’s subsidiaries are mainly agency businesses and third party costs are incurred principally on behalf of clients and are recharged 
to them. 
It is the Group’s policy, wherever possible, to pay outside suppliers when payment has been received from the clients concerned.
Against this background the Group’s subsidiaries generally agree payment terms with their suppliers as set out above when entering binding 
purchase contracts.
The Group seeks to abide by the payment terms agreed with suppliers whenever it is satisfied that the supplier has provided the goods or 
services in accordance with the agreed terms and conditions. The Group does not have a standard code which deals specifically with the terms 
of payment of suppliers.
As at 31 December 2007, the Company’s trade creditors represented the equivalent of 56 days’ invoicing by suppliers (2006: 57 days).
Auditors
Ernst & Young LLP have indicated their willingness to continue in office and a resolution for their reappointment will be proposed at the 
forthcoming Annual General Meeting.
Directors’ statement as to disclosure of information to auditors
The directors who were members of the Board at the time of approving the Report of the directors are listed on pages 20 to 21. Having made 
enquiries of fellow directors and of the Company’s auditors, each of these directors confirms that:
  to the best of each director’s knowledge and belief, there is no information relevant to the preparation of their report of which the Company’s 
auditors are unaware; and 
  each director has taken all the steps a director might reasonably be expected to have taken to be aware of relevant audit information and to 
establish that the Company’s auditors are aware of that information.
Post balance sheet events
On 20 February 2008, the Group sold the business and substantially all of the assets, properties and rights of CapitalBridge Inc. and CapitalBridge Ltd 
and the entire issued share capital of Citigate Data Consulting Limited and CapitalBridge (Pty) Limited (all together, ‘CapitalBridge’) to Ipreo for 
$31.7 million (approximately £16.3 million). CapitalBridge was the Group’s non-core shareholder identification, analytics and investor relations 
technology business. 25 Huntsworth plc Annual report and accounts 2007
Additional information for shareholders
The following information, which summarises certain provisions of the current Articles of Association of Huntsworth PLC (the “Articles”) and 
applicable English law concerning companies (the Companies Act 1985 and the Companies Act 2006, together the “Companies Acts”), is required 
to be provided to shareholders as a result of the implementation of the European Directive on Takeover Bids (2004/25/EC) into English law. This 
is a summary only and the relevant provisions of the Articles and the Companies Acts should be consulted if further information is required. Certain 
amendments will be proposed to the Articles at the annual general meeting of the Company to be held on 15 May 2008, further details of which 
will be set out in the notice convening that meeting.
SHARE CAPITAL
The Company has a single class of share capital which is divided into ordinary shares of 50 pence each. As at 31 December 2007, the Company’s 
issued share capital comprised 210,000,251 ordinary shares of 50 pence each.
RIGHTS AND OBLIGATIONS ATTACHING TO THE ORDINARY SHARES
Subject to applicable law and to any existing shareholders’ rights, shares may be issued with or have attached to them such rights and restrictions 
as the Company may by ordinary resolution decide or, if no such resolution has been passed or so far as the resolution does not make specific provision, 
as the Board (as defined in the Articles) may decide. Subject to the Articles, the Companies Acts and to any resolution passed by the Company 
and without prejudice to any rights attached to existing shares, the unissued shares of the Company (whether forming part of the original or any 
increased capital) shall be at the disposal of the Board which may offer, allot, grant options over or otherwise deal with or dispose of them to such 
persons, at such times and for such consideration and upon such terms as the Board may decide. 
VOTING RIGHTS
Upon a show of hands every member who is present in person at a general meeting of the Company and entitled to vote shall have one vote. 
On a poll every member who is present in person or by proxy shall have one vote for every share held by him. In the case of joint holders of a 
share the vote of the senior who tenders a vote, whether in person or by proxy, shall be accepted to the exclusion of the votes of the other joint 
holders and seniority shall be determined by the order in which the names stand in the register in respect of the joint holding. 
The notice of any general meeting of the Company shall specify the deadlines in relation to exercising voting rights with respect to each 
resolution to be proposed at such meeting. Votes are exercisable at the general meeting of the Company in respect of which the business being 
voted upon is being heard. Votes may be exercised in person or by proxy. The Articles provide a deadline for submission of proxy forms of not 
less than 48 hours before the time appointed for holding the meeting, except in the case of a poll taken subsequently to the date of the meeting 
or adjourned meeting, for which proxy forms must be received not less than 24 hours before the time appointed for the taking of the poll. 
No member shall be entitled in respect of any share held by him to attend or vote (either personally or by proxy) at any general meeting or class 
meeting of the Company or upon a poll or to exercise any other right conferred by membership in relation to general meetings or polls unless all 
calls or other sums presently payable by him in respect of that share have been paid. In addition, no member shall be entitled to vote if he has 
been served with a restriction notice (as defined in the Articles) after the failure to provide the Company with information concerning interests 
in those shares required to be provided under the Companies Acts. 
The Company is not aware of any agreements between shareholders that may result in restrictions on the exercise of voting rights.
DIVIDENDS AND OTHER PAYMENTS
Subject to the provisions of the Companies Acts, the Company may by ordinary resolution from time to time declare dividends in accordance with 
the respective rights of the members, but no dividend shall exceed the amount recommended by the Board. The Board may pay such interim 
dividends as appear to the Board to be justified by the financial position of the Company and may also pay any dividend payable at a fixed rate at 
intervals settled by the Board whenever the financial position of the Company, in the opinion of the Board, justifies its payment. If the Board acts 
in good faith, it shall not incur any liability to the holders of any shares for any loss they may suffer in consequence of the payment of an interim 
or fixed dividend on any other class of shares ranking pari passu with or after those shares.
VARIATION OF RIGHTS
Subject to the Companies Acts, all or any of the rights attached to any existing class of shares may from time to time be varied either with the 
consent in writing of the holders of not less than three-fourths in nominal value of the issued shares of that class (excluding any shares of that 
class held as treasury shares) or with the sanction of an extraordinary (or special) resolution passed at a separate general meeting of the holders 
of those shares.  26 Huntsworth plc Annual report and accounts 2007

TRANSFER OF SHARES
The Board may permit title to shares of any class to be held in uncertificated form and, subject to the Articles, title to uncertificated shares 
may be transferred by means of a relevant system. Provisions of the Articles do not apply to any uncertificated shares to the extent that such 
provisions are inconsistent with the holding of shares in uncertificated form or with the transfer of the shares by means of a relevant system. 
Registration of a transfer of an uncertificated share may be refused in the circumstances set out in the Uncertificated Securities Regulations 
(as defined in the Articles) and where, in the case of a transfer to joint holders, the number of joint holders to whom the uncertificated share 
is to be transferred exceeds four.
Subject to the Articles, any member may transfer all or any of his certificated shares by an instrument of transfer in any usual form or in any 
other form which the Board may approve. The instrument of transfer of a certificated share shall be executed by or on behalf of the transferor 
and (in the case of a partly paid share) the transferee. The transferor of a share shall be deemed to remain the holder of the share concerned 
until the name of the transferee is entered in the register in respect of it. The Board may, in its absolute discretion and without giving any reason 
for so doing, decline to register any transfer of any share which is not a fully paid share. The Board may also decline to register any transfer of 
a certificated share unless:
(i)  the instrument of transfer is duly stamped or duly certified or otherwise shown to the satisfaction of the Board to be exempt from stamp duty 
and accompanied by the relevant share certificate and such other evidence of the right to transfer as the Board may reasonably require; 
(ii)  the instrument of transfer is in respect of only one class of share; and 
(iii)  in the case of a transfer to joint holders, the number of joint holders to whom the share is to be transferred does not exceed four.
Other restrictions on the transfer of shares in the Company may from time to time be imposed:
(i)  by applicable laws and regulations (for example, insider trading laws and market requirements relating to close periods);
(ii)  pursuant to the Listing Rules of the Financial Services Authority whereby certain employees of the Company require the approval of the 
Company to deal in the Company’s securities; and
(iii) in relation to shares issued pursuant to acquisitions made by the Company. 
As at 31 December 2007, shares totalling approximately 6.7% of the issued share capital of the Company were subject to lock-in restrictions 
as set out below:

2,332,928     30 September 2009
1,919,097     31 December 2009
Such shares are also subject to a restriction on transfer to the extent that any sale of such shares must be effected through the Company’s 
corporate broker.
The Company is not aware of any agreements between shareholders that may result in restrictions on the transfer of shares. 
SIGNIFICANT DIRECT OR INDIRECT HOLDINGS OF SECURITIES AND SPECIAL RIGHTS
Directors’ interests in the share capital of the Company are shown in the table on page 33. Major interests in the share capital of the Company 
(i.e. 3% or more) of which the Company has been notified are shown in the table on page 22. There are no securities which carry special rights 
with regard to the control of the Company.
EMPLOYEE SHARE TRUST
The Huntsworth Employee Benefit Trust (EBT) holds approximately 2.5% of the issued share capital of the Company on trust for the benefit 
of employees of the Huntsworth group and their dependants. The voting rights in relation to these shares are exercised by the Trustees. 
The Trustees of the EBT may vote or abstain from voting on shares held in the EBT in any way they think fit and in doing so may take into 
account both financial and non-financial interests of the beneficiaries of the EBT or their dependants.  27 Huntsworth plc Annual report and accounts 2007

APPOINTMENT AND REPLACEMENT OF DIRECTORS
Unless otherwise determined by ordinary resolution of the Company, the Directors (disregarding alternate Directors) shall be not less than two 
nor more than twelve in number. Directors may be appointed by the Company by ordinary resolution or by the Board. Any Director appointed by 
the Board shall retire at the next annual general meeting of the Company and shall then be eligible for election but shall not be taken into account 
in determining the Directors or the number of Directors who are to retire by rotation at that meeting.
At every annual general meeting of the Company, a minimum of one-third of the Directors shall retire by rotation. The Directors to retire by 
rotation shall be those who held office at the time of the two preceding annual general meetings and who did not retire at either of them. If the 
number of Directors so retiring is less than the minimum number required to retire by rotation, additional Directors up to that number shall also 
retire. The additional Directors to retire shall be those who have been longest in office or, in the case of those last elected on the same date, shall 
(unless they otherwise agree among themselves) be determined by lot. Any Director who has held office for a continuous period of nine years 
or more shall also retire. The Company may by special resolution remove any Director before the expiration of his period of office. The office of 
a Director shall be vacated if (i) he resigns his office by notice in writing delivered to or received at the Company’s registered office or tendered 
at a meeting of the Board; or (ii) by notice in writing delivered to or received at the Company’s registered office or tendered at a meeting of the 
Board he offers to resign and the Board resolves to accept such offer; or (iii) by notice in writing delivered to or received at the Company’s 
registered office or tendered at a meeting of the Board, his resignation is requested by all of the other Directors and all of the other Directors 
are not less than three in number; or (iv) he is or has been suffering from mental ill health or becomes a patient for the purpose of any statute 
relating to mental health and the Board resolves that his office is vacated; or (v) he is absent without the permission of the Board from meetings 
of the Board (whether or not an alternate Director appointed by him attends) for six consecutive months and the Board resolves that his office 
is vacated; or (vi) he becomes bankrupt or compounds with his creditors generally; or (vii) he is prohibited by law from being a Director; or (viii) 
he ceases to be a Director by virtue of the Companies Acts or is removed from office pursuant to the Articles.
AMENDMENT TO THE ARTICLES
Any amendments to the Articles may be made in accordance with the provisions of the Companies Acts by way of a special resolution.
POWERS OF THE DIRECTORS
Subject to the provisions of the Companies Acts, the memorandum of association of the Company and the Articles and to any directions given 
by the Company in general meeting by special resolution, the business of the Company shall be managed by the Board which may exercise all the 
powers of the Company whether relating to the management of the business of the Company or not. In particular, the Board may exercise all the 
powers of the Company to borrow money and to mortgage or charge all or any part of the undertaking, property and assets (present and future) 
and uncalled capital of the Company, to issue debentures and other securities and to give security, whether outright or as collateral security, for 
any debt, liability or obligation of the Company or of any third party.
REPURCHASE OF SHARES
Subject to authorisation by shareholder resolution, the Company may purchase its own shares in accordance with the Companies Acts. Any shares 
which have been bought back may be held as treasury shares or, if not so held, must be cancelled immediately upon completion of the purchase, 
thereby reducing the amount of the Company’s issued share capital. The Company has the power to buy back up to 10,186,949 ordinary shares 
during the period up to the next annual general meeting. The minimum price which must be paid for such shares is 50 pence and the maximum 
price payable is 5 per cent above the average of the closing middle market quotations for ordinary shares (as derived from the London Stock Exchange 
Daily List) for the five immediately preceding business days.
SIGNIFICANT AGREEMENTS
The following significant agreement contains provisions entitling the counterparties to exercise termination or other rights in the event of 
a change of control of the Company:
  Under the £85 million credit facility agreement dated 27 July 2007 between, amongst others, the Company, Lloyds TSB Bank plc (as facility 
agent) and the banks named therein as lenders and the £5 million committed overdraft facility dated 27 July 2007 between, amongst others, 
the Company and Lloyds TSB Bank plc, upon a change of control, the agent may, if the lenders so require, cancel the facilities by giving not 
less than 30 days’ notice and declare all outstanding amounts under the facilities, together with accrued interest, immediately due and payable.
There are no agreements between the Company and its directors or employees providing for compensation for loss of office or employment 
(whether through resignation, purported redundancy or otherwise) that occurs because of a takeover bid.

Corporate governance
The Board is committed to high standards of corporate governance and is accountable to the Company’s shareholders for good 
corporate governance.
This statement describes how the principles of corporate governance are applied to the Company and the Company’s compliance with the 
provisions set out in Section 1 of the Combined Code on Corporate Governance published by the Financial Reporting Council in June 2006 
and appended to the Listing Rules (the ‘Code’).
The Board and its Committees
THE BOARD
The Board comprises the independent non-executive Chairman, the Chief Executive, the Finance Director, the Human Resources Director 
and four independent non-executive directors. The Board considers that, notwithstanding their interests in the shares and share options of 
the Company as set out in the Report of the directors on remuneration on pages 31 to 36, the current non-executive directors are independent 
of the management of the Group and are free from any business or other relationship that could materially interfere with the exercise of their 
independent judgement. The Huntsworth PLC Non-Executive Directors’ Share Option Scheme provided a basis for aligning the interests of 
the non-executive directors with those of the Company’s shareholders. It is not intended to make any further awards under this scheme.
One of the non-executive directors, Robert Alcock, has the role of senior independent director. 
The biographies of the directors appear on pages 20 to 21. These demonstrate a range of experience and sufficient calibre to bring independent 
judgement on issues of strategy, performance, resources and standards of conduct, which are vital to the success of the Group.
The Board is responsible to shareholders for the proper management of the Group. A statement of the directors’ responsibilities in respect of the 
financial statements is set out on page 30 and a statement on going concern is given on page 22.
The Board has a formal schedule of matters specifically reserved to it for decision-making. The Board generally meets every month, reviewing trading 
performance, ensuring adequate funding, setting and monitoring strategy, examining acquisition possibilities and when appropriate, reporting to 
shareholders. The non-executive directors have a particular responsibility to ensure that the strategies proposed by the executive directors are fully 
considered. Monthly Board papers containing current and forecast trading results, treasury and shareholder information are distributed in advance 
of the meetings to allow time for preparation by directors and minutes of the meetings are circulated to all directors. The Board also receives 
presentations from executive directors and from divisional management on specific issues as well as having direct access to senior operational 
management within the Group as required.
All directors have access to the advice and services of the Company Secretary, who is responsible to the Board for ensuring that Board procedures 
are followed and that applicable rules and regulations are complied with. In addition, the senior independent director ensures that the directors have 
access to independent professional advice, if required, at the Company’s expense. 
All directors are subject to reappointment by shareholders at the first Annual General Meeting after their appointment and thereafter one third 
of the Board retire annually by rotation. Non-executive directors are appointed for an initial period of three years, subject to reappointment.

BOARD PERFORMANCE EVALUATION 
The performance of the Board is assessed by the Chairman and the Chief Executive and the strengths and weaknesses identified are discussed 
at meetings of the Board.
The Board uses performance evaluation questionnaires. Any improvements required are implemented based on the results.
COMMITTEES OF THE BOARD
The following Committees deal with specific aspects of the Group’s affairs and all the Committees have specific terms of reference which can 
be obtained from the Company Secretary.
AUDIT COMMITTEE
The Audit Committee is chaired by the Company’s senior independent director, Robert Alcock, and its other member is Anthony Brooke. 
Members of the Audit Committee have broad financial experience which has been gained in a variety of disciplines and which the Board 
considers appropriate to enable the Committee to carry out its responsibilities.  29 Huntsworth plc Annual report and accounts 2007
The Board and its Committees continued
COMMITTEES OF THE BOARD CONTINUED
The Audit Committee provides a forum for reporting by the Group’s external auditors. Meetings are also attended, by invitation, by the Chief Executive 
and the Finance Director. There is provision for the external auditors to discuss any concerns they may have with the Committee in the absence 
of management if necessary.
The Audit Committee is responsible for reviewing a wide range of matters including the interim and annual financial statements and monitoring 
the controls which are in force to ensure the integrity of the information reported to the shareholders. The Audit Committee advises the Board 
on the appointment of external auditors and on their remuneration both for audit and non-audit work, and discusses the nature, scope and results 
of the audit with external auditors. The Audit Committee keeps under review the cost effectiveness and the independence and objectivity of the 
external auditors. In particular the Audit Committee oversees the nature and amount of non-audit work undertaken by the auditors each year to 
ensure that external auditor independence is safeguarded.
NOMINATIONS COMMITTEE
The Nominations Committee is chaired by Robert Alcock and its other members are Jon Foulds and Lord Chadlington. The Nominations 
Committee meets as necessary and is responsible for reviewing and making proposals to the Board on the appointment of directors.
In 2007 the Nominations Committee considered the appointment of a new non-executive director. After a rigorous interview process, 
the appointment of Lord Puttnam was recommended to the Board.
During 2007, the Nominations Committee also continued the search and selection process for the appointment of a new non-executive 
Chairman to succeed Jon Foulds. A detailed role profile was agreed by the Committee before external search consultants were engaged to 
prepare a shortlist of potentially suitable candidates. A number of candidates were interviewed and in late February 2008 a recommendation 
to appoint Richard Sharp was made to the Board.
REMUNERATION COMMITTEE
The Remuneration Committee is chaired by Anthony Brooke and its other member is Robert Alcock. Meetings are also attended, by 
invitation, by the Chairman, the Human Resources Director and the Chief Executive. The Remuneration Committee is responsible for making 
recommendations to the Board, within agreed terms of reference, on the Company’s framework of executive remuneration and its cost.
The Remuneration Committee recommends to the Board the contract terms, remuneration and other benefits for each of the executive directors 
and other senior executives of the Group, including performance-related bonus schemes, share-based incentive plans and pension rights. Such 
recommendations are determined after a review of the performance of the individual and by reference to the Company’s financial results. In the 
case of the executive directors, other than the Chief Executive, the Committee seeks the advice of the Chief Executive in any review. The Board 
itself determines the remuneration of the non-executive directors. External advice from a leading firm of remuneration consultants is sought 
when necessary. 
Further details of the Company’s policies on remuneration, service contracts, and share-based incentive plans are given in the Report of the 
directors on remuneration on pages 31 to 36.
Internal control
The Board is responsible for establishing and maintaining the Group’s system of internal control and for reviewing its effectiveness. Such a system 
is designed to manage rather than eliminate the risk of failure to achieve business objectives, and can only provide reasonable but not absolute 
assurance against material misstatement or loss.
In order to create an ongoing process to fulfil this responsibility, the Board has established a number of measures in order to identify, evaluate and 
manage the key financial, operating and compliance risks faced by the Group and these have been in place throughout the year and up to the 
date of the signing of the accounts. These measures are summarised below:
The Board meets monthly, and is responsible for identifying the major business risks faced by the Group and for determining the appropriate 
course of action to manage those risks. The Board has put in place the procedures necessary to implement and comply with the guidance 
‘Internal Control: Guidance for Directors on the Combined Code’ (The Turnbull Report).
The Group has a budgetary process in which the key risks faced by the Group are identified. Performance is monitored and relevant action taken 
through the monthly reporting to the Board of variances from the budget, updated forecasts for the period together with information on the key 
risk areas. 
Capital expenditure is regulated by the budgetary process and authorisation levels. For expenditure beyond specified levels, detailed written 
proposals have to be submitted to the Board. Responsibility levels are communicated throughout the Group including delegation of authority and 
authorisation levels, segregation of duties and other control procedures and each operating Company maintains a system of controls appropriate 
to its business. The Audit Committee monitors controls which are in force and any perceived gaps in the control environment, and also considers 
and determines relevant action in respect of any control issues raised by the external auditors. The findings of the Audit Committee are 
communicated to the Board. 30 Huntsworth plc Annual report and accounts 2007

Corporate governance
continued
Internal control continued
During 2007 and in prior years, the Group has not had a formal internal audit function. Instead it has employed a head office team of finance 
managers who visit the Group operating companies and review their key controls and reporting systems. This team reports to the Group Finance 
Director and appropriate actions are taken to address any weaknesses in internal controls that are identified. In 2008, because of the increasing 
size and geographical reach of the Group especially following the acquisitions of Mmd in 2006 and Dorland and Axis in 2007, it has been decided 
to set up an internal audit function outsourced from a mid-tier accountancy firm. The terms of reference and scope of work are currently being 
finalised and formal internal audit work is expected to commence in the second quarter of 2008.
The Board has established an ongoing process for identifying, evaluating and managing the significant risks faced by the Group. A risk review report, 
which identifies key risks, the impact should they occur, and actions being taken to manage those risks to the desired level, is produced annually and 
reviewed regularly to ensure relevant actions are taken and new risks evaluated by each business unit and by each Group departmental head. 
In addition, proposed improvements to the way that risks are managed are also reported. It is designed to manage rather than to eliminate the risks 
inherent in achieving the Group’s business objectives and can therefore provide only reasonable and not absolute assurance against material 
misstatement or loss. 
Detailed internal financial procedures are set out for operating units. Self certification control questionnaires are completed by the head of finance 
at each operating unit and are reviewed by Group Finance and the results are reported to the Audit Committee.
The directors are satisfied that the procedures in place throughout the year ensured full compliance with the internal control requirements of the 
Combined Code.
Relations with shareholders
The Company maintains an active dialogue with its institutional shareholders and City analysts through regular meetings and presentations, 
the outcome of which are reported to the Board to ensure it keeps in touch with their views. 
All shareholders are welcome to attend the Company’s Annual General Meeting and are encouraged to take advantage of the opportunity to 
direct questions to members of the Board. An overview of the Company’s results and future development plans is given by the Chairman at the 
Annual General Meeting prior to the commencement of the formal business of the meeting. 
Statement by the directors on compliance with the provisions of the Combined Code
The Company has been in full compliance with the provisions set out in the Code throughout the year.
The directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report and the financial statements in accordance with applicable United Kingdom law 
and those International Financial Reporting Standards (‘IFRS’) as adopted by the European Union. 
The directors are required to prepare financial statements for each financial year which present fairly the financial position of the Group and the 
financial performance and cash flows of the Group for that year. In preparing those financial statements, the directors are required to:
 select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently;
 present information, including accounting policies, in a manner that provides relevant, reliable, comparable and understandable information;
  provide additional disclosures when compliance with the specific requirements in IFRS is insufficient to enable users to understand the impact 
of particular transactions, other than events and conditions on the entity’s financial position and financial performance; and 
 state that the Group has complied with IFRS subject to any material departures disclosed and explained in the financial statements.
The directors are responsible for keeping proper accounting records which disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position of the 
Group and to enable them to ensure that the financial statements comply with the Companies Act 1985 and Article 4 of the IAS Regulation. They are 
also responsible for safeguarding the assets of the Group and hence for taking reasonable steps for the prevention and detection of fraud and 
other irregularities. 31 Huntsworth plc Annual report and accounts 2007
This remuneration report is made by the Board for the year ended 31 December 2007. It has been prepared on its behalf and for its approval by 
the Remuneration Committee. The report, which complies with the Directors’ Remuneration Report Regulations 2002, sets out how the principles 
of the Combined Code relating to directors’ remuneration are applied. The Remuneration Committee believes that the Company was compliant 
with the provisions of the Combined Code relating to directors’ remuneration throughout the period. 
The disclosures on pages 31 to 36 relating to the Remuneration Committee, remuneration policy, executive director remuneration, directors’ 
interests in contracts and other transactions with Group companies, directors’ service contracts, directors’ interests in shares and shareholder 
value have not been subject to audit. All other disclosures have been audited.
Remuneration Committee
The Remuneration Committee is responsible for the design and development of remuneration policies for the executive directors of the Company 
and other senior executives of the Group. The composition, chairmanship and activities of the Remuneration Committee are set out on page 29. 
The members of the Committee are both shareholders and option holders and receive remuneration as set out in this report. They abstain from 
participating in remuneration matters where their own interests are concerned and have no involvement in the day to day management of 
the Group’s operations. Other directors attend meetings by invitation only. The Board reviews the policy and sets the remuneration for 
non-executive directors.
During the financial period under review, the Remuneration Committee sought the assistance of the Chairman, Chief Executive and Group 
Director of Human Resources relating to directors’ performance and remuneration. 
During the year the Remuneration Committee contracted Watson Wyatt to review market remuneration data and advise on executive, non-executive 
and long term incentive remuneration requirements. Watson Wyatt was not contracted to supply any other services during 2007.
Remuneration policy
The objective of the Remuneration Committee is to provide appropriate remuneration packages to attract, retain and motivate executive directors 
and senior executives of the highest calibre. The aim of the Group’s remuneration policy is to ensure that key executives are appropriately 
rewarded for their individual contributions to the Group’s performance, commensurate with their duties and responsibilities.
The Remuneration Committee believes that shareholders’ interests are best served by providing executives with remuneration packages which 
have a significant emphasis on performance related pay, through long term share incentive schemes. 
The remuneration of executive directors consists of:
 Basic Salary: This is based on comparable positions in businesses of similar international span and complexity.
  Annual Bonus: This is based on the achievement of financial targets at Group level. The awards under this scheme are variable, dependent on 
performance, and are determined by the Remuneration Committee on an annual basis.
  Long Term Incentive Plans: Under these Plans, executive directors may receive awards of share options and/or shares. The awards under 
these Plans are variable and are determined on an annual basis by the Remuneration Committee.
  Pension: These are all defined contribution schemes, relating to a percentage of basic salary. Other than basic salary, no elements of 
remuneration are pensionable. The Chief Executive has no pension provision.
 Benefits in kind: These can comprise car or car allowance, medical expenses insurance, life insurance, permanent health and accident insurance.
Remuneration details for each director are given on page 33. 
The Remuneration Committee, in conjunction with its advisors, reviews best practice and the competitive environment, when considering the 
appropriate remuneration for executive directors. In addition, the Remuneration Committee considers the appropriate balance of remuneration 
between fixed and variable pay. 
The Remuneration Committee has also reviewed the Group’s pension and severance payment policies and considers these to be acceptable. 
For non-executive directors, the Board considers market practice to ensure that Huntsworth is able to attract the highest calibre of expertise to its Board 
and to reflect individual directors’ responsibilities and time commitments. In the past Huntsworth has granted options to non-executive directors. As in 
2006, Huntsworth has not granted any new options to non-executive directors in 2007 and will not grant any such options in the future.

Executive director remuneration
BASIC SALARY AND BENEFITS
Huntsworth structures remuneration packages for executive directors according to the particular function and level of responsibility of each 
individual director, taking into account the remuneration structures and levels at comparable companies, particularly in the media sector, 
and those of similar complexity and international nature.
ANNUAL BONUS
Huntsworth operates an annual bonus scheme providing a non-pensionable cash bonus for executive directors. The scheme is reviewed 
each year by the Remuneration Committee. The annual bonus allocation is capped at a maximum of 75% of annual salary in the case of the 
Chief Executive and 50% of annual salary for other executive directors. 
Awards are made at the discretion of the Remuneration Committee and are based on the achievement of specific performance targets for each 
director. For 2007, these targets included:
 Growth in revenues and profits (before interest and taxation) 
 Achievement of predetermined levels of earnings per share
 Achievement of predetermined levels of operating margin
 Achievement of levels of cash generation
LONG TERM INCENTIVE PLANS
The Company currently operates the following schemes for both executive directors and other senior executives of the Group:
HUNTSWORTH PERFORMANCE SHARE PLAN (‘PSP’)
This long term incentive plan was approved at the 2006 Annual General Meeting. Under the plan, participants may receive in any one year 
awards of Huntsworth shares having a value of up to two times basic salary. The vesting of these shares is contingent both on the participant 
remaining with the Group for three years from the date of award and the Group meeting specific performance targets. 50% of each award vests 
after three years providing Huntsworth achieves a predetermined level of growth in Earnings per Share (‘EPS’) and 50% on attaining a predetermined 
level of T otal Shareholder Return (‘TSR’). There are no retesting provisions. The Remuneration Committee will continue to review the appropriateness 
of this vesting mechanism. 
The EPS performance condition is based on annual growth in adjusted undiluted EPS of at least 4% above the Retail Price Index (‘RPI’). The base 
EPS for the 2007 grants was 7.3 pence per share (being the EPS for the year to 31 December 2006 as reported in the 2006 financial statements). 
The TSR performance condition is based on Huntsworth achieving a TSR of no less than the median of a specific group of comparable companies. 
The comparator group for awards in 2006 and 2007 was Aegis, Cello, Chime Communications, Creston, Havas, M&C Saatchi, Media Square, 
Omnicom, Publicis and WPP .
HUNTSWORTH MATCHED SHARE PLAN (‘MSP’)
Huntsworth also offers certain UK and overseas based employees (including executive directors) the opportunity to buy shares through the 
Huntsworth Matched Share Plan. Under this plan, employees and directors are invited to purchase existing ordinary shares of the Company 
and to receive, at no cost, one additional ordinary share for each share purchased. Subject to certain limited exceptions, employees and directors 
must remain in employment with the Huntsworth Group for a period of three years to achieve the matching benefit but otherwise no performance 
criteria apply. Awards in respect of 461,572 shares were made in 2007 under the Huntsworth Matched Share Plan. 
ExECUTIVE SHARE OPTION SCHEME 2006
The Executive Share Option Scheme was approved at the 2006 Annual General Meeting. The scheme has a performance target of EPS growth 
of 4% over RPI, compounded annually, over a three-year vesting period. 
Directors’ interests in contracts and other transactions with Group companies
No director has a material interest in any contract with any Group company other than a service contract.

Independent auditors’ report
to the members of Huntsworth PLC
We have audited the Group financial statements of Huntsworth PLC for the year ended 31 December 2007 which comprise the consolidated 
income statement, the consolidated balance sheet, the consolidated cash flow statement, the consolidated statement of changes in equity and 
the related notes 1 to 28. These Group financial statements have been prepared under the accounting policies set out therein.
We have reported separately on the parent company financial statements of Huntsworth PLC for the year ended 31 December 2007 and on the 
information in the directors’ remuneration report that is described as having been audited. 
This report is made solely to the Company’s members, as a body, in accordance with Section 235 of the Companies Act 1985. Our audit work has 
been undertaken so that we might state to the Company’s members those matters we are required to state to them in an auditors’ report and for 
no other purpose. To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility to anyone other than the Company and the 
Company’s members as a body, for our audit work, for this report, or for the opinions we have formed.
Respective responsibilities of directors and auditors
The directors’ responsibilities for preparing the Annual Report and the Group financial statements in accordance with applicable United Kingdom law 
and International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the European Union are set out in the statement of directors’ responsibilities.
Our responsibility is to audit the Group financial statements in accordance with relevant legal and regulatory requirements and International 
Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland).
We report to you our opinion as to whether the Group financial statements give a true and fair view and whether the Group financial statements 
have been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 1985 and Article 4 of the IAS Regulation. We also report to you whether in 
our opinion the information given in the directors’ report is consistent with the financial statements. The information given in the directors’ report 
includes that specific information presented in the Chief Executive’s review, the Operating review, and the Financial review, that is cross referred 
from the business review section of the directors’ report. 
In addition we report to you if, in our opinion, we have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit, or if information 
specified by law regarding director’s remuneration and other transactions is not disclosed.
We review whether the Corporate Governance Statement reflects the Company’s compliance with the nine provisions of the 2006 Combined 
Code specified for our review by the Listing Rules of the Financial Services Authority, and we report if it does not. We are not required to consider 
whether the Board’s statements on internal control cover all risks and controls, or form an opinion on the effectiveness of the Group’s corporate 
governance procedures or its risk and control procedures.
We read other information contained in the Annual Report and consider whether it is consistent with the audited Group financial statements. 
The other information comprises only the directors’ report, the Chairman’s statement, the Chief Executive’s review, the Operating review, 
the Financial review, the unaudited part of the directors’ remuneration report, the corporate governance statement and the five year summary. 
We consider the implications for our report if we become aware of any apparent misstatements or material inconsistencies with the Group 
financial statements. Our responsibilities do not extend to any other information.
Basis of audit opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland) issued by the Auditing Practices Board. 
An audit includes examination, on a test basis, of evidence relevant to the amounts and disclosures in the Group financial statements. It also 
includes an assessment of the significant estimates and judgements made by the directors in the preparation of the Group financial statements, 
and of whether the accounting policies are appropriate to the Group’s circumstances, consistently applied and adequately disclosed.
We planned and performed our audit so as to obtain all the information and explanations which we considered necessary in order to provide us 
with sufficient evidence to give reasonable assurance that the Group financial statements are free from material misstatement, whether caused by 
fraud or other irregularity or error. In forming our opinion we also evaluated the overall adequacy of the presentation of information in the Group 
financial statements.
Opinion
In our opinion:
  the Group financial statements give a true and fair view, in accordance with IFRS as adopted by the European Union, of the state of the 
Group’s affairs as at 31 December 2007 and of its profit for the year then ended; 
  the Group financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 1985 and Article 4 of the IAS Regulation; and
 the information given in the directors’ report is consistent with the Group financial statements.

Notes to the consolidated financial statements
for the year ended 31 December 2007
1. Basis of preparation
The consolidated financial statements of the Group have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (‘IFRS’), 
as adopted in the European Union and as applied in accordance with the provisions of the Companies Act 1985. On 11 March 2008 the 
consolidated financial statements of the Group were authorised for issue in accordance with a resolution of the directors. 
The Group financial statements are presented in Sterling and all values are rounded to the nearest thousand pounds (£000) except where 
otherwise indicated.
2. Significant accounting policies
The financial statements have been prepared on a historical cost basis, except for derivative financial instruments which have been measured 
at fair value. The Group’s significant accounting policies are listed below.
CHAnGES In ACCOUnTInG POLICIES
The accounting policies adopted are consistent with those of the previous financial year except as follows:
The Group has adopted the following accounting standards for the first time. Adoption of these standards did not have any effect on the financial 
position of the Group. They did however give rise to additional disclosures.
 IFRS 7 – Financial Instruments: Disclosures
 IAS 1 – Amendment – Presentation of Financial Statements
The principle effects of these changes are as follows:
IFRS 7 – FInAnCIAL InSTRUMEnTS: DISCLOSURES 
IFRS 7 requires disclosures that enable users to evaluate the significance of the Group’s financial instruments and the nature and extent of risks 
arising from those financial instruments. The new disclosures are included throughout the financial statements.
IAS 1 – PRESEnTATIOn OF FInAnCIAL STATEMEnTS 
This amendment requires the Group to make new disclosures to enable users of the financial statements to evaluate the Group’s objectives, 
policies and processes for managing capital. These disclosures are shown in note 21.
CHAnGES In PRESEnTATIOn
Following the acquisition of Dorland in March 2007 and Axis in July 2007, the Group now has a much more significant presence in the healthcare 
sector, where integrated communications incorporating both Public Relations and non-Public Relations activities (e.g. advertising and medical 
education) are provided to our clients. In addition, following the sale of Citigate Broad Street Inc., one of the Group’s two events management 
(i.e. non-Public Relations) businesses, the remaining events business is not significant enough to merit a segment of its own. Therefore, the 
directors have decided to change the Group‘s segmental disclosures from Public Relations and non-Public Relations to Public Relations and 
Huntsworth Health and have realigned the remaining events business with the public relations operations. 
The comparative figures for 31 December 2006 have been restated accordingly. For the year ended 31 December 2006, revenue of £4,093,000 
and operating profit of £434,000 has been transferred from Public Relations to Huntsworth Health, and revenue of £5,609,000 and operating 
profit of £776,000 has been transferred from non-Public Relations to Huntsworth Health. The balance remaining in non-Public Relations 
(revenue of £6,206,000 and operating profit of £357,000) related to Events and has been transferred to Public Relations.
In line with best practice following the transition to IFRS, the directors have also decided to allocate share-based payment charges to the new 
reporting segments. Previously, these charges were reported as unallocated expenses. The comparative figures for 31 December 2006 have been 
restated accordingly. For the year ended 31 December 2006, share-based payment charges of £531,000 and £192,000 have been transferred 
from unallocated expenses to Public Relations and Huntsworth Health respectively.
For the geographical segments for the year ended 31 December 2006, share-based payment charges of £587,000, £49,000, £85,000, and £2,000 
have been transferred from unallocated expenses to the United Kingdom, Other European, USA, and Rest of World segments respectively.
BASIS OF COnSOLIDATIOn
Huntsworth PLC (‘the Company’) is a limited company incorporated and domiciled in the United Kingdom. The Group financial statements 
consolidate the financial statements of Huntsworth PLC and all of its subsidiaries. 
The results of subsidiaries acquired or disposed of during the period are included in the consolidated financial statements from the date of acquisition 
or to the date of disposal respectively. On acquisition of a business, all of the assets and liabilities of that business that exist at the date of acquisition 
are recorded at their fair values reflecting their condition at that date. Minority interests represent the portion of profit and loss and net assets in 
subsidiaries that is not held by the Group and is presented separately from parent shareholders’ equity in the consolidated balance sheet. 
TURnO vER AnD REvEnUE
Group turnover represents amounts received or receivable from clients, exclusive of value added tax, for the rendering of services and comprises 
charges for fees, commissions, rechargeable expenses incurred on behalf of clients and sales of marketing products. 
Group revenue is turnover less amounts payable on behalf of clients to external suppliers where they are retained to perform part of a specific 
client project or service, and represents fees, commissions and mark-ups on rechargeable expenses and marketing products. 
Turnover and revenue reflect the fair value of the proportion of the work carried out in the year by recording turnover and related costs as service 
activity progresses.  43 Huntsworth plc Annual report and accounts 2007
2. Significant accounting policies continued
TURnO vER AnD REvEnUE COnTInUED
For revenue derived from retainers and time charge fees for services provided, revenue is recognised when the service is performed in 
accordance with the contract and the stage of completion.
Revenue in the form of commissions on media placements and fees for creative and production services provided is recognised as the services 
are performed.
ASSOCIATES
An associate is an entity in which the Group has significant influence and which is neither a subsidiary nor a joint venture. Associates are 
accounted for under the equity method of accounting, where the investment in the associate is carried in the consolidated balance sheet at cost 
plus post acquisition changes in the Group’s share of net assets of the associate. Goodwill relating to an associate is included in the carrying 
amount of the investment and is not amortised. The income statement reflects the share of the results of the operations of the associate after tax. 
Associates have 31 December reporting dates and their accounting policies conform to those used by the Group.
CASH AnD CASH EqUIv ALEnTS
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash in hand and short-term deposits. Bank overdrafts are an integral part of the Group’s cash management 
and are included as a component of cash and cash equivalents for the purpose of the cash flow statement. 
GOODWILL AnD InTAnGIBLE ASSETS
Goodwill arising on consolidation, being the excess of the fair value of the consideration paid over the net fair value of the identifiable assets, 
liabilities and provisions for contingent liabilities acquired, is capitalised as an asset in the balance sheet. The Group has taken advantage of the 
first time adoption exemptions in IFRS 1 and consequently goodwill arising before the date of transition to IFRS has been retained at its carrying 
value as at 1 January 2004.
Goodwill is reviewed for impairment annually and in any periods in which events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not 
be recoverable. For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill acquired in a business combination is allocated to the Group’s cash generating 
units that are expected to benefit from the synergies of the combinations. Impairment testing is determined by assessing the recoverable amount 
of the cash generating units to which the goodwill relates. If the recoverable amount is less than the carrying amount of the cash generating units, 
the impairment loss is allocated first to reduce the carrying amount of the goodwill and then to other assets of the units. 
Determining whether goodwill is impaired requires an estimation of the value in use of cash generating units to which the goodwill is allocated. 
The value in use calculation requires the entity to estimate future cash flows expected to arise from the cash generating units and to choose a 
suitable discount rate in order to calculate the present value of those cash flows. The carrying amount of goodwill at the balance sheet date was 
£202.2 million (2006: £191.7 million). More details are given in note 12. 
Intangible assets comprise acquired separable corporate brand names and customer relationships. Intangible assets are amortised systematically 
over their estimated useful lives, which vary from 3 to 20 years depending on the nature of the asset. These intangible assets are reviewed for 
impairment in any periods in which events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable.
TRADE AnD OTHER RECEIv ABLES
Trade receivables are recognised and carried at the lower of their original invoiced value and recoverable amount. Provision is made when there is 
objective evidence that the Group will not be able to recover balances in full. Balances are written off when the possibility of recovery is assessed 
as being remote.
PROPERTy, PLAnT AnD EqUIPMEnT
Property, plant and equipment are stated at their purchase price, together with any incidental expenses of acquisition. Provision for depreciation 
is made so as to write off the cost of property, plant and equipment less the estimated residual value, on a straight-line basis, over the expected 
useful economic life of the assets concerned. The principal annual rates used for this purpose are:
Motor vehicles 25%
Equipment, fixtures and fittings 15% – 35%
Leasehold improvements are amortised over the period of the lease, from 3 to 15 years.
The carrying values of property, plant and equipment are reviewed for impairment periodically if events or changes in circumstances indicate 
the carrying value may not be recoverable.
WORK In PROGRESS
Work in progress is stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value, and consists of third party costs incurred on behalf of clients which have 
still to be recharged.  44 Huntsworth plc Annual report and accounts 2007
Notes to the consolidated financial statements
for the year ended 31 December 2007
2. Significant accounting policies continued
TAxATIOn
The tax charge for the period represents the sum of the tax currently payable and deferred tax. 
The tax currently payable is based on taxable profit for the year. Taxable profit differs from net profit as reported in the income statement as it 
excludes items of income or expense that are deductible in other years and items that are never deductible. The current and deferred tax charges 
are calculated using tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date. 
Deferred tax is the tax expected to be payable or recoverable on differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in the financial 
statements and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable profit, and is accounted for using the balance sheet liability 
method. Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised for all taxable temporary differences and deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent 
that it is probable that taxable profits will be available against which deductible temporary differences can be utilised. Such assets and liabilities 
are not recognised if the temporary difference arises from the initial recognition of goodwill or of other assets and liabilities in a transaction 
(other than in a business combination) that affects neither the tax profit nor the accounting profit.
Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for taxable temporary differences arising on investments in subsidiaries and associates, except where 
the Group is able to control the reversal of the temporary difference and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the 
foreseeable future. 
The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each balance sheet date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that 
sufficient taxable profits will be available to allow all or part of the asset to be recovered. 
Deferred tax is calculated at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period when the liability is settled or the asset is realised. Deferred tax 
is charged or credited in the income statement, except when it relates to items charged or credited directly to equity, in which case the deferred 
tax is also dealt with in equity.
LOAnS AnD BORROWInGS
Obligations for loans and borrowings are recognised when the Group becomes party to the related contracts and are measured initially at fair 
value less directly attributable transaction costs. 
After initial recognition, interest bearing loans and borrowings are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method.
PROvISIOnS
Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present obligation (legal or constructive) as a result of a past event, it is probable that an outflow 
of resources will be required to settle the obligation and a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation. If the amounts involved 
are material, provisions are determined by discounting the expected future cash flows at a pre-tax rate which reflects the current market 
assessment of the time value of money and, when appropriate, the risks specific to the liability. Where discounting is applied to provisions, 
the increase in the value of the provision due to the passage of time is recognised as a finance cost.
Where a leasehold property substantially ceases to be used for the Group’s business, or a commitment is entered into which would cause this to 
occur, provision is made to the extent that the recoverable amount of the interest in the property is expected to be insufficient to cover the future 
obligations relating to the lease.
Acquisitions made by the Group typically involve an earn-out arrangement whereby the consideration payable includes a deferred element that is 
contingent on the future financial performance of the acquired entity. no material contingent consideration will become payable unless the acquired 
entity delivers greater revenues or profits during the earn-out period than those used for calculating the initial consideration. The provision for 
contingent consideration for acquisitions represents the directors’ best estimate of the amount expected to be payable in cash or shares. 
LEASInG AnD HIRE PURCHASE COMMITMEnTS
Assets held under finance leases, which are leases where substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of the asset have passed to the 
Group, and hire purchase contracts, are capitalised in the balance sheet and are depreciated over their useful lives. The capital elements of future 
obligations under finance leases and hire purchase contracts are included as liabilities in the balance sheet. The interest elements of the rental 
obligations are charged in the income statement over the periods of the finance leases and hire purchase contracts and represent a constant 
proportion of the balance of capital repayments outstanding.
Rentals payable under operating leases are charged to the income statement on a straight line basis over the lease term. Sublet income on 
operating leases is recognised on a straight line basis over the lease term. 45 Huntsworth plc Annual report and accounts 2007
2. Significant accounting policies continued
FOREIGn CURREnCIES
Sterling is the functional currency of Huntsworth PLC and the presentational currency of the Group. The functional currency of subsidiaries is the 
local currency of the economic environment in which they operate. Transactions denominated in foreign currencies are initially translated at the 
exchange rate ruling at the date of the transaction. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at the rate 
of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date. 
The financial statements of subsidiaries are translated into the presentational currency of the Group on consolidation. Assets and liabilities are 
translated at the exchange rate ruling at the balance sheet date with items in the income statement being translated at the average rate for the 
period. Exchange differences arising on consolidation are recorded in a separate component of equity, but are recognised in the consolidated 
income statement on disposal of the subsidiary to which they relate. The Group has elected not to record cumulative translation differences 
arising prior to the transition date as permitted by IFRS 1. In utilising this exemption, all cumulative translation differences are deemed to be 
zero as at 1 January 2004 and all subsequent disposals shall exclude any translation differences arising prior to the date of transition. 
Goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on the acquisition of an overseas subsidiary are treated as assets and liabilities of the overseas 
subsidiary and translated at the closing rate. 
DERIv ATIvE FInAnCIAL InSTRUMEnTS
The Group uses derivative financial instruments to reduce its exposure to foreign exchange and interest rate movements. The Group does not hold 
or issue derivative financial instruments for financial trading purposes but derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting are accounted for at 
fair value through the income statement. Derivative financial instruments are initially recognised at fair value at the contract date and continue to be 
stated at fair value at the balance sheet date with gains and losses on revaluation being recognised immediately in the income statement. 
Cash flow hedges are used to hedge against fluctuations in future cash flows on the Group’s debt funding due to movements in interest rates. 
When a cash flow hedge is employed, the effective portion of the change in the fair value of the hedging instrument is recognised directly in equity 
(hedging reserve) until the gain or loss on the hedged item is realised. Any ineffective portion is always recognised in the income statement. 
Foreign currency instruments are used to hedge against unfavourable exchange rate fluctuations that affect the results of the Group’s overseas 
operations when translated into sterling. Hedge accounting is not applied to these instruments and the associated cost is recognised at fair value 
through the income statement. Derivatives are carried as assets when the fair value is positive and as liabilities when the fair value is negative. 
The fair value of derivatives is determined by reference to market values for similar instruments.
BORROWInG COSTS AnD FInAnCE InCOME
Borrowing costs are recognised as an expense when incurred. Finance income is recognised as the interest accrues (using the effective interest 
rate method).
SHARE-BASED PAyMEnTS
EqUITy-SETTLED TRAnSACTIOnS
The Group issues equity-settled share-based payments to certain employees. The Group has used binomial and Monte Carlo share option 
valuation models for the purposes of calculating the fair value of the share options granted to employees. The cost of share-based payments 
is recognised in the income statement as an expense spread over the relevant vesting period, with a corresponding increase in equity. 
At each balance sheet date before vesting, the cumulative expense is calculated, representing the extent to which the vesting period has expired 
and management’s best estimate of the non-market conditions and the number of equity instruments that will ultimately vest. The movement 
in cumulative expense since the previous balance sheet date is recognised in the income statement, with a corresponding entry in equity.
Where an equity-settled award is cancelled, it is treated as if it had vested on the date of cancellation, and any cost not yet recognised in the 
income statement for the award is expensed immediately. Any compensation paid up to the fair value of the award at the cancellation or 
settlement date is deducted from equity, with any excess over fair value being treated as an expense in the income statement.
The fair value of options in acquired companies which are rolled over into the Group’s option schemes is pro-rated between the pre and 
post-acquisition periods in accordance with the vesting period.
In accordance with the first time adoption exemptions available under IFRS 1, the Group elected to fair value only equity instruments that have 
been granted after 7 november 2002 that had not vested by 1 January 2005.
CASH-SETTLED TRAnSACTIOnS
The Group issues cash-settled share-based payments to certain employees under the Matched Share Plan scheme. 
The cost of cash-settled transactions is measured at the grant date using the market value of the shares at the date of grant. During the vesting 
period a liability is recognised representing the product of the fair value of the award and the portion of the vesting period expired as at the 
balance sheet date. From the end of the vesting period until settlement, the liability represents the full fair value of the award as at the balance 
sheet date. Changes in the carrying amount for the liability are recognised in the income statement for the period.

EMPLOyEE BEnEFITS
All accumulating employee compensated absences that are unused at the balance sheet date are recognised as a liability.
DIvIDEnDS
Interim dividends are recognised as a deduction from equity in the period in which they are paid. Final dividends are recognised in the period 
in which they are approved by the Company in general meeting.

nEW STAnDARDS AnD AMEnDMEnTS nOT APPLIED
Standards, interpretations and amendments to existing standards that have been published as mandatory for later accounting periods but are not 
yet effective and have not been adopted early by the Group are as follows:
IFRS 8 – Operating Segments (effective for accounting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2009) replaces IAS 14 and aligns segment reporting 
with the requirements of the US standard SFAS 131 – Disclosures About Segments of an Enterprise and Related Information. The new standard uses 
a ‘management approach’ under which segment information is presented on the same basis as that used for internal reporting purposes.
IAS 1 – Presentation of Financial Statements revised (effective for accounting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2009). IAS 1 has been 
revised to enhance the usefulness of information presented in the financial statements.
IAS 23 – Borrowing costs revised (effective for accounting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2009). The revised standard eliminates the 
option of expensing all borrowing costs and requires borrowing costs to be capitalised if they are directly attributable to the acquisition, 
construction or production of a qualifying asset. 
IFRIC 11, IFRS 2 – Group and Treasury Share Transactions (effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 March 2007) provides guidance on 
the accounting of share-based transactions involving treasury shares for group entities, such as options over a parent’s shares, as equity-settled or 
cash-settled share-based payment transactions. 
IFRIC 12 – Service Concession Arrangements (effective for accounting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2008) provides guidance where 
a private sector operator participates in providing services to the public sector, for example under PFI contracts.
IFRIC 13 – Customer Loyalty Programmes (effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 July 2008) requires that loyalty credit awards 
granted to customers as part of a sales transaction are accounted for as a separate component of the sales transaction.
IFRIC 14 – The Limit on a Defined Benefit Asset, Minimum Funding Requirements and their Interaction (effective for accounting periods 
beginning on or after 1 January 2008) addresses how to assess the limit under IAS 19 Employee Benefits, on the amount of the surplus that can 
be recognised as an asset.
The directors do not anticipate that the adoption of these standards and interpretations will have a material impact on the Group’s financial 
statements in the period of initial application. 47 Huntsworth plc Annual report and accounts 2007
3. Acquisitions and disposals
I) ACqUISITIOnS
A) DORLAnD C ORPORATIOn
On 9 March 2007 the Group’s 90% owned subsidiary, Huntsworth Health Group Inc., acquired the entire share capital of Dorland Corporation 
(‘Dorland’), a leading healthcare communications agency operating in the USA.
The initial consideration was US $20.7 million (£10.6 million), paid in cash. Deferred consideration may be payable, with an interim payment 
to be settled in cash, based on the profits for the year to 31 December 2007. A final payment may be due based on profits in the three years 
to 31 December 2010, payable in cash. The maximum total consideration payable is US $50.0 million (£25.3 million).
The carrying value and provisional fair value of the net assets at the date of acquisition were as follows:
      Carrying Recognised 
      value on acquisition 
      £000 £000

of Dorland. 
B) AxIS HEALTHCARE COMMUnICATIOnS LLC 
On 13 July 2007 the Group’s 90% owned subsidiary, HHCG Acquisition Corporation, acquired a 100% stake in Axis Healthcare Communications LLC 
and its subsidiaries (together ‘Axis’), a leading healthcare communications company operating in the USA.
The initial consideration was US $18.4 million (£9.1 million) paid in cash. Deferred consideration may be payable, with an interim payment to be 
settled in cash, based on the profits for the six months to 31 December 2007. A final payment may be due based on profits in the period from 
acquisition to 31 December 2010, payable in cash. The maximum total consideration is US $55.0 million (£27.2 million). 48 Huntsworth plc Annual report and accounts 2007

Bank loans and overdrafts acquired      1,252
       10,642
The goodwill is attributable to the workforce of the acquired business and the significant synergies expected to arise after the Group’s acquisition of Axis.
C) TRIMEDIA PUBLIC AFFAIRS (AUSTRIA)
On 31 October 2007, the Group increased its stake in Trimedia Public Affairs (Austria) from 26% to 56% for consideration of ¤56,000 (£40,000), 
and therefore from this date it has been accounted for as a subsidiary instead of an associated undertaking.
D) COnTRIBUTIOn TO REvEnUE AnD OPERATInG PROFIT
From the date of acquisition to 31 December 2007, Dorland has contributed £9.8 million to Group revenue and £1.1 million to Group operating 
profit after highlighted items of £1.2 million.
From the date of acquisition to 31 December 2007, Axis has contributed £10.1 million to Group revenue and £1.5 million to Group operating 
profit after highlighted items of £0.5 million.
It is not practicable to allocate interest and tax to the acquired businesses as the Group’s treasury and tax operations are managed centrally.
If all the acquisitions in the year had taken place at the beginning of the year, the revenue of the Group would have been £174.3 million and the 
operating profit of the Group would have been £17.5 million after highlighted items of £8.9 million.
II) DISPOSALS
A) CITIGATE SARD vERBInnEn
On 15 February 2006 the Company announced that it had reached an agreement to sell Citigate Sard verbinnen (‘CSv’) by the end of 31 December 2009. 
Shareholders approved the sale on 6 March 2006. Under the sale agreements, 51% was acquired by certain executives of CSv on 5 January 2007 for 
US $2.5 million (£1.4 million) and a fixed net asset payment of US $2.7 million (£1.5 million) was made on 27 September 2007. The remaining 49% will be 
acquired no later than 31 December 2009 for a total cash consideration of not less than US $17.5 million (£10.2 million) (such amounts to have an aggregate 
present value of US $20.0 million (£11.6 million) as at 1 January 2006).This will be reduced by the amount of cash distributions from CSv from 1 January 2006.
The assets and liabilities of CSv were classified as held for sale at 31 December 2006 and the company has been accounted for as an associated 
undertaking from 1 January 2007.
B) CITIGATE DEMUTH
On 16 March 2007, Citigate Demuth GmbH was sold to Media Square plc for cash consideration of ¤670,000 (£456,000).
C) CITIGATE BROAD STREET
On 1 October 2007, the trade, assets and liabilities of the events management business of Citigate Broad Street Inc. (‘CBS’) were sold to certain 
executives of CBS for cash consideration of US $397,000 (£195,000) with deferred contingent consideration to a maximum of US $900,000 (£452,000). 49 Huntsworth plc Annual report and accounts 2007

CapitalBridge Inc. and CapitalBridge Limited, and the entire issued share capital of Citigate Data Consulting Limited and CapitalBridge (Pty) 
Limited (all together, ‘CapitalBridge’) to Ipreo for US $31.7 million (approximately £16.3 million). CapitalBridge was the Group’s non-core 
shareholder identification, analytics and investor relations technology business.

      £000 £000
Charged to operating profit      
Amortisation of intangible assets     5,962 4,051

Charged to profit before tax      
Impairment of investment in associates     2,716 —
      11,061 13,722
Highlighted items charged to profit before tax comprise significant non-cash charges and non-recurring items which are highlighted in the income 
statement because separate disclosure is helpful in understanding the underlying performance of the business.
AMORTISATIOn OF InTAnGIBLE ASSETS
Intangible assets are amortised systematically over their estimated useful lives, which vary from 3 to 20 years depending on the nature of the 
asset. These are significant non-cash charges which arise as a result of acquisitions.
IMPAIRMEnT OF GOODWILL AnD InTAnGIBLE ASSETS 
The impairment charge in 2006 principally related to the write down of goodwill and intangible assets of Citigate Sard verbinnen (£3.7 million) 
and Citigate Demuth (£4.2 million).
LOSS On DISPOSAL OF SUBSIDIARIES
The loss on disposal of subsidiaries principally arises because of the write off of goodwill and intangible assets following the sale of the Citigate 
Broad Street events business to management. 53 Huntsworth plc Annual report and accounts 2007
6. Highlighted items continued
ACqUISITIOn PA yMEnTS TO EMPLO yEES DEEMED TO BE REMUnERATIOn
Certain payments of consideration to non-shareholding employees of acquired businesses under arrangements set up prior to acquisition are 
deemed to be remuneration in the post-acquisition period. These costs will cease once the relevant earn-outs have been settled.
This remuneration is not payable to the individuals concerned until the end of the earn-out period. In the meantime, the related assets and liabilities 
are held in a separately managed fund within the Group. The balance on the fund is included in trade and other receivables (see note 16).
nET RESTRUCTURInG AnD OTHER nOn-RECURRInG COSTS 
Merger, restructuring and other non-recurring costs comprise expenses relating to the integration and restructuring of businesses within the 
Group together with certain other non-recurring costs. In 2007, the balance principally represents costs of restructuring the Group’s healthcare 
businesses (£0.6 million) and its operations in Italy and Spain (£0.5 million), together with other non-recurring costs (£0.5 million), offset by the 
release of surplus provisions (£1.6 million), principally relating to vacant property, which has been successfully sublet. In 2006, these costs related 
to the restructuring of the UK healthcare business and the launch of Huntsworth Health (£0.9 million), aborted acquisition costs (£0.6 million), 
and other non-recurring costs (£0.2 million).
IMPAIRMEnT OF InvESTMEnT In ASSOCIATES
As explained in note 3, the recoverable amount of Sard v erbinnen is a fixed amount, determined by the sale agreement of 14 February 2006. 
Consequently all profits recognised subsequently are matched by an equal and opposite impairment of the Group’s investment in the entity.

The income tax expense for the year is based on the United Kingdom statutory rate of corporation tax of 30% (2006: 30%). Overseas tax is 
calculated at the rates prevailing in the respective jurisdictions. The impact of changes in statutory tax rates relates to the reduction of the UK 
corporation tax rate from 30% to 28% from 1 April 2008. The change has resulted in a net deferred tax credit arising from the reduction in the 
balance sheet carrying value of deferred tax assets and liabilities to reflect the anticipated rate of tax at which the assets and liabilities are 
expected to reverse. 
Following the post-balance sheet disposal of CapitalBridge (see note 3), an additional deferred tax credit of £4.4 million has been recognised 
through highlighted items to reflect the amount of tax losses that are expected to be utilised as a result of this sale. 55 Huntsworth plc Annual report and accounts 2007

The basic earnings per share calculation is based on the profit for the year attributable to parent company shareholders divided by the weighted 
average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the year.
Diluted earnings per share is calculated based on the profit for the year attributable to parent company shareholders divided by the weighted 
average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the year adjusted for the potentially dilutive impact of employee share option schemes 
and shares to be issued as part of contingent consideration on acquisitions of subsidiaries.
Adjusted earnings per share is calculated in order to provide information to shareholders about continuing trading performance and is based on 
the profit attributable to parent company shareholders excluding highlighted items together with related tax effects as set out below:

Brands and customer relationships are being amortised over their useful economic lives of between 3 and 20 years. The amounts recognised 
above for intangible assets arising on acquisitions in the period are provisional awaiting final determination in accordance with the time limit 
allowed in IFRS 3. Details of acquisitions made during the period are set out in note 3.
Adjustments to goodwill on prior year acquisitions represent changes to consideration payable.
IMPAIRMEnT TESTInG FOR CASH GEnERATInG UnITS COnTAInInG GOODWILL
Goodwill acquired through business combinations is allocated to groups of cash generating units (‘CGUs’) for impairment testing as follows: 
      2007 2006 
      £000 £000
Public Relations     160,681 178,242
Huntsworth Health     41,511 13,435
      202,192 191,677
The recoverable amount of CGUs are determined based on value in use calculations, using cash flow projections based on the 2008 budgets 
approved by management. Cash flows are extrapolated using a growth rate of 2.5% which is considered reasonable and prudent based on past 
experience and current expectations of the long-term industry growth rate. A pre-tax discount rate of 7.9% (2006: 9.6%) has been used in 
discounting the projected cash flows. 
Forecast future cash flows are inherently uncertain and could change materially over time due to the impact of, inter alia, market growth, discount 
rates and unexpected changes in key clients or key personnel. 
Management has considered reasonably possible sensitivities in the key assumptions on which the value in use calculations are based. If growth 
rates reduced to 2%, or if the discount rate increased to 10%, then this would not lead to the carrying values of the groups of CGUs to significantly 
exceed their recoverable amounts. 57 Huntsworth plc Annual report and accounts 2007

19. Provisions continued
DEFERRED COnSIDERATIOn FOR ACqUISITIOnS
Acquisitions made by the Group typically involve an earn-out arrangement whereby the consideration payable includes a deferred element, 
payable in either cash or cash/shares at the Company’s option, that is contingent on the future financial performance of the acquired entity. 
The Group anticipates settling the majority of the deferred consideration provisions over the next three years.
PROPERTy PROvISIOn
Provision for property represents amounts set aside in respect of property leases which are vacant or onerous. The quantification of these 
provisions depends upon the Group’s ability to exit the leases early or to sublet the properties and has been determined based on external 
professional advice. In general, property costs are expected to be incurred over periods for which individual properties remain vacant or, 
where occupied, to the termination of the leases in question, which range from one to seven years.
REORGAnISATIOn PRO vISIOn
As a result of acquisitions and disposals of subsidiaries, and the merger with Incepta, the Group has implemented a number of restructuring 
initiatives. In addition, when disposing of businesses, normal commercial warranties and indemnities have been given to purchasers, and 
provisions have been made to cover the best estimate of the Group’s exposure.

Deferred tax has been calculated using the anticipated rates that will apply when the assets and liabilities are expected to reverse. The recoverability 
of deferred tax assets is supported by the expected level of future profits in the countries concerned. There are other deferred tax assets totalling 
£4.7 million (2006: £16.0 million) that have not been recognised on the basis that their future economic benefit is uncertain.  62 Huntsworth plc Annual report and accounts 2007

21. Financial instruments
21(A). FInAnCIAL RISK MAnAGEMEnT , POLICIES AnD STRATEGIES
The Group’s principal financial instruments comprise bank loans, bank overdrafts, loan notes, finance leases and cash and short-term deposits. 
The main purpose of these financial instruments is to provide finance for the Group’s operations. The Group has various other financial assets and 
liabilities such as trade receivables and trade payables, which arise directly from its operations. During the year the Group has financed its business 
through an overdraft facility and a revolving credit facility arranged with Lloyds TSB Bank plc and The Royal Bank of Scotland plc (n ote 26(c)). 
The Group also enters into derivative transactions, primarily interest rate swaps and caps and foreign currency average rate options. The purpose 
is to manage the interest rate and currency risks arising from the Group’s operations and its sources of finance. It is, and has been throughout the 
period under review, the Group’s policy that no trading in financial instruments should be undertaken.
The main risks arising from the Group’s financial instruments are cash flow interest rate risk, foreign exchange risk, liquidity risk and credit risk. 
The Board reviews and agrees policies for managing each of these risks and they are summarised below.
InTEREST RATE RISK
The Group’s exposure to the risk of changes in market interest rates relates primarily to the Group’s long term debt obligations with floating 
interest rates.
The Group’s policy is to manage its interest cost using a mix of fixed and variable rate debts. To manage this, the Group enters into interest rate 
swaps and caps. These agreements are designated to hedge underlying debt obligations. At 31 December 2007, after taking into account the 
effect of interest rate swaps and caps, approximately 65% of the Group’s borrowings are at a fixed or capped rate of interest.
The following table demonstrates the sensitivity to a reasonably possible change in interest rates, with all other variables held constant, of the 
Group’s profit before tax (through the impact of floating rate borrowings).

United Kingdom    -100 567 430
USA    -100 42 —
FOREIGn CURREnCy RISK
As a result of significant operations in the United States and the Eurozone, the Group’s balance sheet can be affected significantly by movements 
in the US Dollar and Euro exchange rates against Sterling. This is largely through the retranslation of the Group’s foreign operations’ results and 
balances into Sterling. The Group has few transactional currency exposures other than certain foreign currency bank accounts.
The following table demonstrates the sensitivity to reasonably possible changes in the US Dollar and Euro exchange rates, with all other variables 
held constant, of the Group’s profit before tax.

Euro    -10% 111 —
CREDIT RISK
The Group trades only with recognised, creditworthy third parties. It is the Group’s policy that customers who wish to trade on credit terms are 
subject to credit verification procedures. In addition, receivable balances are monitored on an ongoing basis with the result that the Group’s 
exposure to bad debts has not been significant.
With respect to credit risk arising from other financial assets of the Group, which comprise only cash and cash equivalents, the Group’s exposure 
to credit risk arises from default of the counterparty, with a maximum exposure equal to the carrying amount of these instruments.
There are no significant concentrations of credit risk within the Group.  63 Huntsworth plc Annual report and accounts 2007

CAPITAL MAnAGEMEnT
The primary objective of the Group’s capital management policy is to ensure that it maintains a strong credit rating and healthy capital ratios in 
order to support its business and maximise shareholder value.
The Group manages its capital structure and makes adjustments to it in light of changes in economic conditions. To maintain or adjust the capital 
structure the Group may adjust the dividend payment to shareholders, return capital to shareholders or issue new shares. no changes were made 
in the objectives, policies or processes during the years ended 31 December 2007 and 2006.
The Group monitors capital using a gearing ratio, which is net debt divided by total capital plus net debt. The gearing ratio as at 31 December 2007 
and 31 December 2006 was as follows:
      2007 2006

The options outstanding at the end of the year have a weighted average remaining life of 6.3 years (2006: 4.8 years).
FAIR v ALUE OF SHARE OPTIOnS
The fair value of share options granted in 2007 and 2006 was calculated using either the binomial option pricing model or the Monte Carlo model. 
The inputs to these models were:
     2007 2006
Weighted average share price    106.6 pence 91.4 pence
Weighted average exercise price    49.9 pence 23.4 pence
Expected volatility     32% 37%
Expected life     3–10 years 3–10 years
Risk free rate    5.5% 4.7%
Expected dividend yield    1.5% 1.5%
The expected life of the options is based on historical data and is not necessarily indicative of exercise patterns that may occur. The expected 
volatility reflects the assumption that the historical volatility is indicative of future trends, which may also not necessarily be the actual outcome. 
The Group recognised total expenses of £2,107,000 (2006: £1,435,000) related to equity-settled share-based transactions during the year. 
The fair value of the cash-settled options for the Matched Share Plan is measured at the grant date using the market value of the shares at the 
date of grant. The services received and a liability to pay for those services are recognised over the expected vesting period. Until the liability 
is settled it is remeasured at each reporting date with changes in fair value recognised in profit or loss.
The carrying amount of the liability relating to the cash-settled options under the Matched Share Plan at 31 December 2007 is £925,000 
(2006: £404,000), and the charge to the income statement for the year is £521,000 (2006: £404,000). A total of 80,000 shares under the 
Matched Share Plan vested during the year (2006: nil). 68 Huntsworth plc Annual report and accounts 2007

Independent auditors’ report
to the members of Huntsworth PLC
We have audited the parent company financial statements of Huntsworth PLC for the year ended 31 December 2007 which comprise the balance 
sheet and the related notes 1 to 15. These parent company financial statements have been prepared under the accounting policies set out therein. 
We have also audited the information in the directors’ remuneration report that is described as having been audited. 
We have reported separately on the Group financial statements of Huntsworth PLC for the year ended 31 December 2007.
This report is made solely to the Company’s members, as a body, in accordance with Section 235 of the Companies Act 1985. Our audit work has 
been undertaken so that we might state to the Company’s members those matters we are required to state to them in an auditors’ report and for 
no other purpose. To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility to anyone other than the Company and the 
Company’s members as a body, for our audit work, for this report, or for the opinions we have formed.
Respective responsibilities of directors and auditors
The directors’ responsibilities for preparing the Annual Report, the directors’ remuneration report and the parent company financial statements 
in accordance with applicable United Kingdom law and Accounting Standards (United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice) are set 
out in the statement of directors’ responsibilities.
Our responsibility is to audit the parent company financial statements and the part of the directors’ remuneration report to be audited in 
accordance with relevant legal and regulatory requirements and International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland).
We report to you our opinion as to whether the parent company financial statements give a true and fair view and whether the parent company 
financial statements and the part of the directors’ remuneration report to be audited have been properly prepared in accordance with the 
Companies Act 1985. We also report to you whether in our opinion the information given in the parent company directors’ report is consistent 
with the financial statements. The information given in the directors’ report includes that specific information presented in the Chief Executive’s 
review, the Operating review, and the Financial review, that is cross referred from the business review section of the directors’ report. 
In addition we report to you if, in our opinion, the Company has not kept proper accounting records, if we have not received all the information and 
explanations we require for our audit, or if information specified by law regarding directors’ remuneration and other transactions is not disclosed.
We read other information contained in the Annual Report and consider whether it is consistent with the audited parent company financial 
statements. The other information comprises only the directors’ report, the Chairman’s statement, the Chief Executive’s review, the Operating 
review, the Financial review, the unaudited part of the directors’ remuneration report, the corporate governance statement, and the five year 
summary. We consider the implications for our report if we become aware of any apparent misstatements or material inconsistencies with the 
parent company financial statements. Our responsibilities do not extend to any other information.
Basis of audit opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland) issued by the Auditing Practices Board. 
An audit includes examination, on a test basis, of evidence relevant to the amounts and disclosures in the parent company financial statements 
and the part of the directors’ remuneration report to be audited. It also includes an assessment of the significant estimates and judgements made 
by the directors in the preparation of the parent company financial statements, and of whether the accounting policies are appropriate to the 
Company’s circumstances, consistently applied and adequately disclosed.
We planned and performed our audit so as to obtain all the information and explanations which we considered necessary in order to provide us 
with sufficient evidence to give reasonable assurance that the parent company financial statements and the part of the directors’ remuneration 
report to be audited are free from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or other irregularity or error. In forming our opinion we also 
evaluated the overall adequacy of the presentation of information in the parent company financial statements and the part of the directors’ 
remuneration report to be audited.
Opinion
In our opinion:
  the parent company financial statements give a true and fair view, in accordance with United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting 
Practice, of the state of the Company’s affairs as at 31 December 2007; 
  the parent company financial statements and the part of the directors’ remuneration report to be audited have been properly prepared 
in accordance with the Companies Act 1985; and
 the information given in the directors’ report is consistent with the parent company financial statements.

Statement of directors’ responsibilities for the 
company financial statements
The directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report and the financial statements in accordance with applicable United Kingdom law 
and United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice. 
Company law requires the directors to prepare financial statements for each financial period which give a true and fair view of the state of affairs 
of the Company and of the profit or loss of the Company for that period. In preparing those financial statements, the directors are required to:

 make judgements and estimates that are reasonable and prudent;

Notes to the company financial statements
for the year ended 31 December 2007
1. Basis of preparation
The financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention, except for derivative financial instruments which have been 
measured at fair value, and in accordance with applicable accounting standards in the United Kingdom. The basis of preparation is consistent 
with the financial statements for the previous period other than the adoption of UITF 44 (IFRIC 11) FRS 20 (IFRS 2) – Group and Treasury Share 
Transactions. As permitted by Section 230 of the Companies Act 1985, Huntsworth PLC has not presented its own profit and loss account. 
The Company’s significant accounting policies are set out below.
2. Significant accounting policies
TAnGIBLE FIxED ASSETS
Tangible fixed assets are stated at their purchase price, together with any incidental expenses of acquisition. Provision for depreciation is made 
so as to write off the cost of tangible fixed assets less the estimated residual value, on a straight line basis, over the expected useful economic life 
of the assets concerned. The principal annual rates used for this purpose are:
Motor vehicles 25%
Equipment, fixtures and fittings  15% – 33%
The carrying values of tangible fixed assets are reviewed for impairment periodically if events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying 
value may not be recoverable.
PROvISIOnS
Provisions are recognised when the Company has a present obligation (legal or constructive) as a result of a past event, it is probable that an 
outflow of resources will be required to settle the obligation and a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation. If the amounts 
involved are significant, provisions are determined by discounting the expected future cash flows at a pre-tax rate which reflects the current 
market assessment of the time value of money and when appropriate the risks specific to the liability. Where discounting is applied to provisions, 
the increase in the value of the provision due to the passage of time is recognised as a finance cost.
Where a leasehold property substantially ceases to be used for the Company’s business, or a commitment is entered into which would cause this 
to occur, provision is made to the extent that the recoverable amount of the interest in the property is expected to be insufficient to cover the 
future obligations relating to the lease.
Acquisitions made by the Company typically involve an earn-out arrangement whereby the consideration payable includes a deferred element 
that is contingent on the future financial performance of the acquired entity. no material contingent consideration will become payable unless 
the acquired entity delivers greater revenues or profits during the earn-out period than prior to acquisition. The provision for contingent 
consideration for acquisitions represents the directors’ best estimate of the amount expected to be payable in cash or shares.
OPERATInG LEASE COMMITMEnTS
Rentals payable under operating leases are charged to the profit and loss account on a straight line basis over the lease term. 
FOREIGn CURREnCIES
Sterling is the functional currency and presentational currency of the Company. Transactions denominated in foreign currencies are initially 
translated at the exchange rate ruling at the date of the transaction. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are 
retranslated at the rate of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date and the resulting gains and losses are recorded in the profit and loss account.
DERIv ATIvE FInAnCIAL InSTRUMEnTS
The Company uses derivative financial instruments to reduce its exposure to foreign exchange and interest rate movements. The Company 
does not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for financial trading purposes but derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting are 
accounted for at fair value through the profit and loss account. Derivative financial instruments are initially recognised at fair value at the contract 
date and continue to be stated at fair value at the balance sheet date with gains and losses on revaluation being recognised immediately in the 
profit and loss account. 
EMPLOyEE SHARE OWnERSHIP PLAnS
Shares in the Company held by Employee Benefit Trusts have been included within equity and are stated at cost.
SHARE-BASED PAyMEnTS
The Company issues equity-settled share-based payments to certain employees. The Company has used binomial and Monte Carlo share option 
valuation models for the purposes of calculating the fair value of the share options granted to employees. The cost of share-based payments to 
Company employees is recognised in the profit and loss account as an expense spread over the relevant vesting period, with a corresponding 
increase in equity. 
At each balance sheet date before vesting, the cumulative expense is calculated, representing the extent to which the vesting period has expired 
and management’s best estimate of the non-market conditions and the number of equity instruments that will ultimately vest. The movement in 
cumulative expense since the previous balance sheet date is recognised in the profit and loss account, with a corresponding entry in equity.
Where an equity-settled award is cancelled, it is treated as if it had vested on the date of cancellation, and any cost not yet recognised in the profit 
and loss account for the award is expensed immediately. Any compensation paid up to the fair value of the award at the cancellation or settlement 
date is deducted from equity, with any excess over fair value being treated as an expense in the profit and loss account.
In accordance with the exemptions available under FRS 20, the Company has elected to fair value only equity instruments that have been granted 
after 7 november 2002 that had not vested by 1 January 2005. 76 Huntsworth plc Annual report and accounts 2007
Notes to the company financial statements
for the year ended 31 December 2007
2. Significant accounting policies continued
SHARE-BASED PAyMEnTS COnTInUED
UITF44 was issued on 2 February 2007. Where a parent entity grants rights in its equity instruments to employees of a subsidiary, and such share-based 
compensation is accounted for as equity-settled in the consolidated financial statements of the parent, UITF 44 requires the subsidiary to record an 
expense for such compensation in accordance with FRS 20 (share-based payments), with a corresponding increase recognised in equity as a contribution 
from the parent. Consequently, in the financial statements of the parent (Huntsworth PLC), the Company has recognised an addition to fixed asset 
investments of the aggregate amount of these contributions with a credit to equity for the same amount. The 2006 comparatives have been restated 
to increase investments and equity by £2,475,000 each. There is no impact on the profit and loss account. 
BORROWInG COSTS AnD FInAnCE InCOME
Borrowing costs are recognised as an expense when incurred. Finance income is recognised as the interest accrues (using the effective interest 
rate method).
DIvIDEnDS
Interim dividends are recognised as a deduction from equity in the period in which they are paid. Final dividends are recognised in the period in 
which they are approved by the Company in general meeting, as required by FRS 21.
Dividends receivable from investments are recognised in the profit and loss account in the period in which they are paid. 
CASH FLOW STATEMEnT
The Company has applied the exemption available under FRS 1 (Revised) and has not presented a cash flow statement. The cash flow statement 
has been presented in the Group financial statements.
RELATED PARTy TRAnSACTIOnS
In accordance with FRS 8 Related Party Disclosures, the Company is exempt from disclosing transactions with entities that are part of the 
Huntsworth PLC Group, or investees of the Group qualifying as related parties, as it is a parent publishing consolidated financial statements.
3. Profit attributable to members of Huntsworth PLC
The profit for the year of £66,000 (2006: loss for the year of £1,782,000) attributable to the shareholders of Huntsworth PLC has been dealt with 
in the financial statements of that Company.
The auditors’ remuneration for audit services to the Company was £105,000 (2006: £100,000).

DEFERRED COnSIDERATIOn FOR ACqUISITIOnS
Acquisitions made by the Company typically involve an earn-out arrangement whereby the consideration payable includes a deferred element, 
payable in cash or shares at the Company’s option, that is contingent on the future financial performance of the acquired entity. The Company 
anticipates settling the majority of the deferred consideration provisions over the next three years.
PROPERTy PROvISIOn
Provision for property represents amounts set aside in respect of property leases which are vacant or onerous. In general, property costs are 
expected to be incurred over periods for which individual properties remain vacant or, where occupied, to the termination of the lease, which 
range from one to five years.
REORGAnISATIOn PRO vISIOn
As a result of acquisitions and disposals of subsidiaries, and the merger with Incepta, the Company has implemented a number of restructuring 
initiatives. In addition, when disposing of businesses, normal commercial warranties and indemnities have been given to purchasers, and 
provisions have been made to cover the best estimate of the Group’s exposure. 
10. Derivative financial instruments
The Company’s principal financial instruments comprise bank loans, bank overdraft, loan notes, finance leases and cash and short-term deposits. 
The main purpose of these financial instruments is to raise finance for the Company and its subsidiaries. The Company has various other financial 
assets and liabilities such as debtors and creditors, which arise directly from its operations. During the year the Company has financed its business 
through an overdraft facility and a revolving credit facility arranged with Lloyds TSB Bank plc and The Royal Bank of Scotland plc. 
The main risk arising from the Company’s financial instruments are interest rate and foreign exchange. During the year, the Company has put in place 
two interest rate caps and an interest rate swap to manage the interest rate profile. Also the Company entered into average rate currency options, 
to manage the foreign exchange exposure. For full disclosures of the financial instruments see the consolidated financial statements (note 21). 79 Huntsworth plc Annual report and accounts 2007

The options outstanding at the end of the year have a weighted average remaining life of 6.5 years (2006: 2.6 years). 
FAIR v ALUE OF SHARE OPTIOnS
The fair value of share options granted in 2007 and 2006 were calculated using either the binomial option pricing model or the Monte Carlo model. 
The inputs to these models were:
     2007 2006
Weighted average share price    108.7 pence 97.6 pence
Weighted average exercise price    65.0 pence 66.1 pence
Expected volatility     32% 37%
Expected life     3–10 years 3–10 years
Risk free rate    5.5% 4.7%
Expected dividend yield    1.5% 1.5%
The expected life of the options is based on historical data and is not necessarily indicative of exercise patterns that may occur. The expected 
volatility reflects the assumption that the historical volatility is indicative of future trends, which may also not necessarily be the actual outcome. 
The Company recognised total expenses of £643,000 (2006: £331,000) related to equity-settled share-based transactions during the year.
The fair value of the cash-settled options for the Matched Share Plan is measured at the grant date using the market value of the shares at the 
date of grant. The services received and a liability to pay for those services are recognised over the expected vesting period. Until the liability 
is settled it is remeasured at each reporting date with changes in fair value recognised in profit or loss.
The carrying amount of the liability relating to the cash-settled options under the Matched Share Plan at 31 December 2007 is £478,000 
(2006: £173,000), and the charge to the income statement for the year is £305,000 (2006: £173,000). no cash-settled options under the 
Matched Share Plan vested at 31 December 2007 (2006: nil).

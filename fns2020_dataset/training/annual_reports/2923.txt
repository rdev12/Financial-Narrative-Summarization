Chairman’s statement
Care UK is strongly positioned 
to benefit from further service 
and market reform, offering good 
opportunities for delivering exceptional 
long‑term value to shareholders.
Care UK’s strong performance 
during 2008 demonstrates the 
resilience of the group and the 
benefits of investment in the 
emerging healthcare market.
Adjusted operating profit, including 
joint venture operating profit and 
stated before amortisation and 
impairment charges, is up by 
20% to £36.4m (2007: £30.4m) 
on revenue, including share of 
joint venture revenue, increased by 
24% to £341.6m (2007: £275.7m), 
and adjusted profit before tax is up 
by 20% to £24.1m (2007: £20.1m). 
Adjusted basic earnings per share 
were up by 6% to 27.92p (2007: 
26.26p). The total basic loss per 
share was 4.98p (2007: earnings 
of 20.27p). Operating cash flow 
was £46.9m (2007: £32.5m), an 
increase of 44%, representing a 
cash conversion ratio of 147% 
(2007: 128%) measured against 
adjusted operating profit, 
excluding share of joint 
venture operating profit.
John Nash Chairman
_2_CUK_ar08_section1_review.indd   4 19/12/2008   16:03:21 Care UK Plc Annual report and accounts 2008 05
The most notable financial 
performance in the group has been 
in the Health Care division, reflecting 
both the full year effect of the 
Mercury Health acquisition and the 
part year benefit of acquiring full 
ownership of Partnership Health 
Group (“PHG”). Most existing 
services within this division have 
now reached an operational steady 
state and are achieving their targeted 
levels of returns. With revenue and 
adjusted operating profit increasing 
by 73% and 112% respectively, 
the division represented around 
30% of both revenue and adjusted 
operating profit. This share is 
expected to show further material 
increase during the coming years 
from the full year benefit of the 
acquisition of PHG and as new 
services are commissioned 
and reach their planned 
contribution levels.
From its start‑up position in 2004, 
Care UK’s Health Care business 
is now widely recognised as 
the sector’s largest and most 
influential independent sector 
provider of healthcare services 
to NHS patients.
Overall, the aggregate revenue of 
the three Social Care divisions was 
10% higher than the previous year 
(of which 6% was organic) with 
adjusted operating profit being 
4% higher. Solid performances in 
both Residential Care and much 
of the Specialist Care division were 
partly offset by contract start‑up 
challenges in Community Care and, 
within the Specialist Care division, 
the continuing difficulties 
in Children’s Services (which 
represents just 4% of total revenue).
Compensation negotiations
Compensation discussions continue 
with the Department of Health 
(“DoH”) regarding the termination 
of the West Midlands diagnostics 
contract, which ceased providing 
services in February 2008, as well as 
claims for wasted bid costs relating 
to Phase 2 Independent Sector 
Treatment Centre (“ISTC”) contracts. 
As reported at the half year, our 
review of the consequences of 
the termination has resulted in 
certain impairment charges being 
made. Satisfactory resolution of 
these negotiations is expected 
in the current financial year.
Employees and quality
People that are drawn to becoming 
health and social care professionals 
are of a special nature and Care UK 
is extremely fortunate to have a 
workforce that is dedicated to 
providing excellent care.
As a sector leader, Care UK sets the 
highest standards of both care service 
quality and value – whether services 
are purchased by commissioners or 
directly by individuals. The group 
invests extensively in recruiting the 
right people, in training and in 
quality review resources to underpin 
this commitment. Equally important 
is to encourage a culture that is 
both open and honest so that 
any shortcomings are readily 
identified and resolved.
It is pleasing to note that across 
the Social Care divisions, ratings 
by the Commission for Social Care 
Inspection indicate an improvement 
of some 10% in services assessed 
“excellent” or “good” to 80%, 
ahead of market comparators. 
Similarly it is encouraging to note 
that in our Health Care treatment 
centres, independent patient 
_2_CUK_ar08_section1_review.indd   5 19/12/2008   16:03:27 Care UK Plc Annual report and accounts 2008 06

continued
Employees and quality 
continued
survey data indicates that all 
patients are satisfied with their 
experience, with 95% reporting 
this as excellent or very good. In 
the most recent patient satisfaction 
surveys undertaken, the PHG centres 
have out‑performed the top 20% 
of NHS hospitals on every one of 
over 20 measures. All Care UK 
and PHG centres have continued 
to maintain their record of having 
zero hospital acquired infections 
for the “superbugs” MRSA and 
clostridium difficile.
Care UK is committed to 
developing an organisation 
that reflects the UK’s diversity. 
Our aim is to attract and develop 
talented people who relate to the 
needs of our patients and service 
users, who aspire to develop 
optimal solutions and who will 
drive continual improvement.
Dividend
The board is recommending 
a final dividend of 3.10p per 
share (2007: 2.80p), an increase 
of 11%, which will be paid on 
18 February 2009 to shareholders 
on the register on 23 January 2009. 
This increase is consistent with the 
Brand 
development A
A review of branding started in 2007 culminated 
in the launch of a revised Care UK brand this year. 
The revised branding, featured for the first time in 
this report, emerged from extensive research into 
the attitudes and opinions of staff, service users, 
patients, commissioners and opinion leaders. 
It will enable us to signal that our market proposition 
has changed significantly in recent years in response 
to a fast changing market, with consumer choice 
a major driver of change. 
It is a bolder, more consumer friendly brand 
and tested well in market and staff surveys. 
The brand is communicated through a new 
visual identity, the proposition: “fulfilling lives” 
and revised brand values. A new group website 
was launched in parallel.
_2_CUK_ar08_section1_review.indd   6 19/12/2008   16:03:30 Care UK Plc Annual report and accounts 2008 07
previously stated policy of growing 
dividends ahead of inflation whilst 
maintaining a level of earnings 
cover appropriate to the group’s 
growth objectives. Dividend cover 
in 2008 is 6.3 times, measured 
against adjusted basic earnings 
per share (2007: 6.5 times).
Outlook
The group’s Social Care and Health 
Care businesses benefit from high 
levels of contracted revenue and 
the non‑discretionary nature of 
our services offer relative market 
stability. The group is benefiting 
from its well managed funding 
arrangements. The group’s core 
debt facilities are fully committed 
until February 2015 with material 
headroom of over £80m to facilitate 
further growth. In addition, the 
group’s balance sheet is further 
supported by the market 
valuations of its property assets 
being substantially higher than 
their book values, even in the 
prevailing market conditions.
Our immediate focus is on 
the continuity of service at the 
two Wave 1 ISTC contracts, in 
Plymouth and Barlborough Links, 
that are due to complete their 
initial contract term during 2010. 
We are encouraged by the level 
of engagement with both local 
Primary Care Trusts (“PCTs”) and 
the DoH and we are optimistic 
that Care UK will be able to 
continue operating these centres, 
with acceptable financial returns, 
beyond their initial contract periods. 
Of equal importance to the group’s 
strategy is the continuation of our 
success in our well established 
Social Care services and the recovery 
of operational performance where 
it has fallen short of our own high 
expectations. For some time, 
Care UK has considered care 
home acquisition valuations to 
be stretched and we have chosen 
not to participate in recent market 
consolidation as a consequence. 
However, the board perceives 
that over the coming period 
valuations are likely to become 
more realistic and that a modest 
acquisition plan, targeted at single 
homes or small groups of homes, 
might become a part of the group’s 
strategy in this area.
Both the current Government 
and the Conservative Party have 
reaffirmed their strategies for the 
evolution of a competitive market 
for NHS services and we anticipate 
further growth in both our Health 
Care and Social Care businesses as 
a consequence. We are currently 
bidding for selective opportunities 
in the NHS’ “Equitable Access” 
procurement for primary care 
services, and we anticipate a 
further substantial range of 
opportunities to flow from 
the NHS strategy to outsource 
and introduce competition for 
PCT Provider Arms, that represent 
expenditure of around £10bn per 
annum. Services provided range 
from community healthcare 
services and hospitals to mental 
health and learning disabilities.
Having successfully created 
competencies strongly aligned 
with the integration of secondary 
and primary healthcare and 
with social care services, 
Care UK is strongly positioned 
to benefit from further service 
and market reform, offering 
good opportunities for delivering 
exceptional long‑term value 
to shareholders.

social Care
The group’s Social Care activities 
comprise the Residential Care, 
Community Care and Specialist 
Care divisions, which are 
commented on individually over 
the following pages. Aggregate 
Social Care revenue has increased 
by 10% with a rise in adjusted 
operating profit of 4%. The reduced 
operating margin reflects the cost 
implications of the first phase of 
additional holiday entitlements 
arising under the Work and 
Families Act 2006, which took 
effect from 1 October 2007, as 
well as the impact of operational 
start‑up difficulties with two 
Community Care contracts.
Residential Care 
The Residential Care division 
achieved growth in both revenue 
and operating profit of close to 
7%, maintaining operating margins. 
The total number of beds at the 
end of the financial year, including 
day care places, was 3,303 compared 
with 3,217 at the beginning of the 
year. Financial occupancy (“beds 
paid for”) was similar to the 97% 
level achieved in the previous year. 
Care UK is encouraged by the NHS 
strategy, supported by the policies of 
both Labour and Conservative Parties, 
to introduce a wider range of non‑NHS 
providers to stimulate competition.

Chelsea, commenced services in 
March 2008. This is a 60 bed

under a minimum 21 year 
management contract, with 
30 of the beds being contracted. 
Good progress has been made 
on the construction of the new 
care home in Slough with service 
provision expected to commence 
as planned by spring 2009. This 
is a 120 bed residential care facility, 
with 90 beds contracted for a 
minimum period of 15 years.
Good progress has also been 
made on the construction 
of the greenfield care home 
in Chelmsford. This is a 120 bed 
home being targeted primarily at 
self‑funding residents and is on 
schedule to open as planned 
by late spring 2009.
Acquisition of 
Partnership Health Group A
In August 2008 Care UK completed the acquisition of the 50% 
interest in PHG not previously owned from Life Healthcare.
PHG brings four highly successful and well run ISTCs into the group’s 
portfolio, located in Plymouth, Barlborough Links (near Chesterfield), 
Maidstone and Ilford (North East London). A fifth centre, in 
Southampton, opened in October 2008. All of the existing centres 
have consistently delivered good clinical outcomes and high patient 
satisfaction levels; for example, as with Care UK’s centres, no inpatient 
cases of the “superbugs” MRSA and clostridium difficile have occurred 
in any of PHG’s centres.
Plymouth and Barlborough Links are specialist orthopaedic centres; 
North East London provides a range of general and orthopaedic 
surgical services, as will the new centre in Southampton. Maidstone 
provides general surgery and chemotherapy services. The PHG centres 
will be combined with Care UK’s existing ISTCs that were originally 
procured under a single DoH contract.
Full ownership of PHG positions Care UK as the leading independent 
sector provider to the NHS of ISTC and primary care services and 
presents the group with a significant opportunity to be a key 
contributor to the NHS strategy to provide greater patient 
choice and service enhancement.

We are currently finalising a 
preferred bidder appointment 
for a new care home, which will 
have around 100 beds. The home 
will be opened under a 25 year 
contract for around two‑thirds of 
the care beds with the remaining 
one‑third planned to be marketed 
either as NHS continuing care beds 
or to self‑funding individuals. 
In this case, the relevant Local 
Authority will fund the construction 
of this home, with Care UK entering 
into a 25 year lease for the site. 
Consequently, our required level 
of capital investment for this 
project will be low. Services are 
expected to commence in this 
home in late summer 2010.
The board has approved in

of a new 74 bed greenfield

Barking and Dagenham GP Practice 
and Walk‑in Centre A
Challenge
To develop an integrated GP Practice and Walk‑in Centre in one 
of the most deprived areas in England where patients with the 
greatest need have historically had poor access to a GP .
Result
Care UK were awarded this contract as a result of the first national 
procurement for a general practice. Operated on behalf of Barking 
and Dagenham PCT trust, the service was up‑and‑running within 
just six weeks. 25 new patients have joined the practice every week 
since opening and it is currently providing a service for around 
3,000 patients. 
The Walk‑in service, which operates alongside the GP Practice, 
provides immediate access for 80 patients every day and is open 
365 days a year from 8.00am to 8.00pm. 
The success of this unit has in part shaped the provision of general 
practice services across the country.
As a result of the success of and the high demand for these primary 
care services, the PCT asked Care UK to provide a Clinical Assessment 
Treatment Service (“CATS”) in addition (i.e. one‑stop outpatient 
services) capable of offering five different specialties: dermatology, 
urology, neurology, gynaecology and ENT . 
The service currently sees 400 patients each month saving 
patients the journey to hospital and allowing them to benefit 
from assessment, diagnostics and treatment (including minor 
procedures) close to their home. The service aims to provide a 
one‑stop facility with reduced requirement for follow‑up and 
onward referral to secondary care services. 
The quality of these integrated community‑based services is high. 
Scores for contract and service quality consistently place us in the 
top 10% of practices and we have a patient satisfaction level 
of 94%. The safety of services is overseen and accredited by 
the Health Care Commission.

decided to withdraw from the 
development of an 84 bed 
residential care home in 
Timperley, Greater Manchester, 
announced in May 2008, following 
the attempted renegotiation of 
agreed lease terms by the developer. 
As indicated in the Interim 
Management Statement 
released on 18 August 2008, 
we have decided to postpone the 
planned creation of a property 
company structure given the 
current uncertain market 
conditions. We continue to 
evaluate potential greenfield 
developments on an individual 
leasehold basis, but anticipate that 
the potential acquisition of existing 
individual care homes or small groups 
of homes may prove to offer better 
value than the construction of new 
properties in the immediate future. 
Community Care 
Community Care maintained 
its strong growth record with 
revenue up by 21% over the prior 
year, of which organic growth 
represented 9% with the balance 
coming from acquisitions made 
in the current and previous years.
The operating margin within 
Community Care has shown 
a reduction compared with 
the previous year as a result 
of the costs of additional holiday 
entitlements arising from the Work 
and Families Act 2006, along with 
specific operational factors relating 
particularly to the start‑up of new 
contracts in Hertfordshire and 
the London Borough of Harrow. 
Services under both of these 
contracts commenced during the 
year and at the year end amounted 
to around 5,000 hours per week 
in total. Excluding the effects 
of these factors, the operating 
margin within Community Care 
would have been similar to the 
level achieved in 2007. Management 
changes have been implemented 
to address the resolution of these 
operational issues and avoid similar 
recurrence, although we do expect 
some continuing impact on margin 
in the current financial year.
During the year, new and 
renewed contracts have been 
awarded in Cheshire, Surrey, 
St Helens, Southampton and the 
Royal Borough of Kensington and 
Chelsea; the net expected growth 
from newly won contracts 
is approximately 5,000 hours 
per week. 
In line with our strategy of 
achieving growth both from 
selective acquisitions as well 
as organic development, we 
acquired Badminton Healthcare, 
based in South Gloucestershire, 
in February 2008 and Robnet, 
based in Wolverhampton and 
Dudley, in May 2008. These 
acquisitions have added around 
3,500 hours per week and increase 
our coverage in the South West 
and West Midlands regions. 
We have currently chosen not to 
make further acquisitions as we 
expect valuations to fall in line 
with wider market conditions.
At 30 September 2008, the 
weekly total of hours of care 
provided amounted to around 
123,000 compared with 115,000 
at the start of the financial year, 
an increase of 7%. The total 
hours delivered in the year 
amounted to around 6.2m 
compared with 5.2m in the 
previous year, an increase 
of around 19%.

continued
social Care continued
Community Care continued
Community and home‑based 
care is increasingly favoured by 
commissioners over residential 
and hospital alternatives and 
Local Authorities are clearly 
tending to award larger 
homecare contracts to fewer 
providers. Consequently, this area 
remains of strategic importance 
to Care UK and we are actively 
seeking opportunities to extend 
our community‑based service 
offering. In particular, we are 
seeking to leverage synergy 
opportunities with our Specialist 
Care and Health Care capabilities.
Specialist Care 
Specialist Care has delivered 
revenue growth of 3% in the 
year, all of which was organic.
The Mental Health business achieved 
revenue growth of 4% and an 
improvement in the operating 
margin, mainly through higher 
occupancy levels. We continue 
to review opportunities for the 
development of community‑based 
mental health services in response to 
the preferences of commissioners, 
whilst removing residential 
capacity where it no longer 
meets service needs.
In Learning Disabilities, revenue 
growth of around 5% was 
achieved following the award 
of a new contract in Scotland 
and a number of extended 
services in England. The growth 
in operating profit in the year 
was slightly muted following 
the good growth experienced 
in 2007. Care UK is particularly 
strong in the provision of 
“supported living” services that 
are favoured by commissioners 
and service users and we continue 
to seek opportunities both to grow 
and to broaden our service offering 
in this attractive business area.
In Children’s Services we have 
seen a revenue reduction of 3% 
as a result of challenging market 
conditions for residential care, with 
commissioners increasingly placing 
young people for shorter term 
stays and seeking generally to 
minimise higher fee residential 
placements. Whilst the operating 
margin in this business has 
remained positive for the year, 
we are continuing to rationalise 
our capacity to better match 
prevailing demand. 
The Specialist Care management 
team continue to be focussed on 
the improvement of operating 
performance across each of the 
businesses within this division 
and on developing our good 
market positions in mental 
health and learning disabilities 
supported living services.

The group’s Heath Care activities

Care and Secondary Care divisions, 
together with PHG, which has been 
fully owned by the group since 
acquiring the 50% interest 
not previously owned on 
1 August 2008. 
The Health Care business has 
shown good improvement in 
financial performance compared 
with 2007, with revenue increasing 
by 73% and adjusted operating 
profit increasing by 112%.

The improvement has come 
from the full year contribution 
of Mercury Health, acquired in 
April 2007, the full ownership 
of PHG for the latter part of the 
financial year and from growing 
scale in the Primary Care business. 
Approximately 35% of the total 
revenue reported within Health 
Care in the year was derived from 
PHG, around 13% from the group’s 
original Primary Care business 
and the balance from the former 
Mercury Health business.
The West Midlands diagnostics 
contract that was terminated 
by the DoH in November 2007 
contributed revenue of £9.1m 
during the first half of the year with 
a small adjusted operating profit. 
With effect from 1 January 2009, 
services within the Health Care 
division will be focussed in 
two areas, Primary Care 
and Secondary Care, which 
are reported on further 
on pages 14 to 17. 
Service 
development A
Development of residential services is focusing on individual care packages 
that respond to the independence and individual choice agenda for those 
who choose to receive care in a residential environment rather than in an 
acute setting.
Development of our community based services aims to assist increasing 
numbers of people to stay in their own home supporting their short, 
medium and longer term needs, through concentrating on the outcomes 
of the services we provide.
In specialist care, learning disabilities is a key focus for the business. 
Community‑based ‘supported living’ solutions are being developed 
that respond to the local government agenda to enable people to live 
in their homes with dignity and independence.
As the clear leader in Independent Sector Treatment Centre provision, 
Care UK is actively researching local healthcare needs and patient 
expectations for the post contract period and identifying future service 
developments which will respond to the needs of the communities served.
In unscheduled care we continue to expand our urgent care, and 
walk‑in services that enable PCTs to ensure that patients can be seen 
at the right time by the right person in the right place. 
Prison healthcare is a growing area of expertise 
for Care UK. A strong emphasis on collaborative 
partnerships with NHS and third sector providers 
and an ability to apply knowledge from across 
the business enables Care UK to offer single 
source solutions to commissioners.

Primary Care 
Performance across the current 
range of primary care services 
has been encouraging. The 
GP practices, out‑of‑hours 
and walk‑in services have all 
seen increasing patient numbers 
and new prison health services 
commenced at HMP Garth, 
Wymott, Preston and Brixton. 
New Clinical Assessment and 
Treatment Support services 
(“CATS”) also commenced in 
the financial year in Barking 
and Dagenham and North 
Manchester along with a 
new five‑year contracted GP 
service in Greater Manchester.
A new seven‑year diagnostics 
contract in Rotherham is on 
schedule to commence services 
in spring 2009 and good progress 
has been made on the mobilisation 
of the Greater Manchester CATS 
service that was procured under 
the Phase 2 ISTC programme 
and reached financial close in 
June 2008. This service will be 
provided by highly sophisticated 
mobile units visiting seven sites 
around Greater Manchester and 
will deliver a range of services 
to NHS patients. Services will 
include assessment and treatment 
of minor injuries, diagnostics 
and scanning, endoscopies and 
pre‑operative assessments, covering 
a number of specialities including 
orthopaedic, musculoskeletal, 
Ears, Nose and Throat (“ENT”), 
urology and general surgery. 
Services under this seven‑year 
contract are on track to commence 
in early 2009 as planned.
The Primary Care team has been 
actively engaged in bidding for 
various services to be provided 
to NHS patients under the 
“Equitable Access to Primary 
Medical Care Services” initiative. 
Given that many of these 
opportunities are relatively small, 
we are being highly selective in 
targeting projects that offer an 
entry point for further potential 
developments. We are pleased to 
have recently been awarded two 
small new primary care contracts 
for commencement in spring 2009.
We believe that we are 
well positioned to be a leading 
provider in a Primary Care market 
that is being identified by 
both the Government and 
Ellesmere House A
Opened in 2008 by HRH The Countess 
of Wessex, Ellesmere House was recently 
awarded a two star rating from the 
Commission for Social Care Inspection, 
the highest rating a new home can 
receive on its first inspection.
Inspectors spoke to residents who 
commented that the home was “like a 
5‑star hotel complete with care services”.
Specialising in residential and nursing 
care and developed in partnership with the 
Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea, 
Ellesmere House is a beautiful environment 
with a lot of bright open spaces. The state 
of the art building includes courtyards and 
contemplation gardens, with opportunities 
for residents to enjoy their own space, 
as well as lounges and recreational areas 
for group activities.
The innovative approach taken by staff at 
Ellesmere House is called “ Activity Based 
Care” and is simply a move away from 
residential care as ‘doing for’ towards a more 
creative, adaptable and beneficial ‘doing 
with’ approach. Each resident is supported 
to succeed with extra help during a huge 
range of daily tasks, often reflecting their 
own life history or work experiences. 
Activities range from tending a flower 
garden to helping with jobs they would 
normally do in their own home, thus 
helping residents to maintain health, 
well being and independence.

the Conservative Party to offer 
considerable scope for extended 
services and greater choice 
for patients.
Secondary Care 
The GC8 Wave 1 ISTC contract 
acquired with Mercury Health 
in 2007 has continued generally 
to perform well and in line with 
our expectations at the time of 
the Mercury Health acquisition. 
In particular the centre in 
Portsmouth performed strongly 
during the year as did the smaller 
centre in Wycombe, which is 
focused on diagnostics services. 
We have now agreed a revised 
case‑mix for the centre in Medway, 
which we believe will result in the 
contract utilisation for this centre 
becoming on a par with our 
other centres. The final GC8 
centre, a diagnostics centre in 
Havant, was opened as planned 
in January 2008 and is also now 
beginning to see improved 
patient volumes.
Operational performance at the 
Sussex Orthopaedic Treatment 
Centre (“SOTC”) in Haywards 
Heath has improved significantly 
in the second half of the year. 
In health care, we are pleased to have established a 
number of entry points and service competencies that 
we expect to leverage during the coming years.
Market 
development A
Care UK is well placed for growing its business 
thanks to a rapidly growing base of relationships 
with commissioning authorities. As a result of 
continuing success in bidding for public sector 
contracts we currently serve all ten Strategic 
Health Authorities in England, one in three 
PCT s, 28% of GPs and 130 local Authorities 
(approximately 50% of the principal 
commissioning authorities).
This geographic development also means that 
one in three of the UK population lives within 
the catchment area of a Care UK facility.
The growth in number and spread of our 
facilities will mean that brand awareness will 
benefit from personal experience, word of mouth 
(from satisfied service users) and from our staff 
acting as brand ambassadors in their local 
community. In combination with an increasing 
investment in consumer marketing in the coming 
years this will provide a strong platform for growth.
The PCTs we provide services to cover almost one 
third of the UK population.

continued
health Care continued
Secondary Care continued
During this period we have 
significantly reduced the high 
patient waiting list inherited with 
Mercury Health and have agreed 
an enhancement of services in 
line with the NHS “18 week 
Referral to Treatment target”. 
Subsequent to the year end, 
both of these matters have been 
formalised in a Deed of Variation 
to the original GC8 contract. 
As from 1 January 2009, the GC8 
centres in Portsmouth, Wycombe 
and Havant will form part of the 
Primary Care business whilst the 
SOTC and the Medway centre 
will, together with the whole 
of the PHG business, form 
the basis of Secondary Care.
Independent patient survey data 
indicates that 95% of patients 
reported either an excellent or 
very good overall experience and 
that all patients were satisfied. 
All Care UK and PHG centres 
continue to experience zero 
hospital acquired infections 
for the “superbugs” MRSA 
and clostridium difficile.
During the year PHG continued 
to perform strongly both clinically 
and financially. In the most recent 
patient satisfaction surveys 
undertaken, the PHG centres 
have out‑performed the benchmark 
of the top 20% of NHS hospitals 
on every one of over 20 measures. 
We completed the acquisition of 
the 50% of PHG not previously 
owned on 1 August 2008 and 
have subsequently integrated 
PHG within the group’s Health 
Care division.
The Phase 2 ISTC in Southampton, 
located in part of the Royal South 
Hants Hospital, reached financial 
close in June 2008. Services under 
this seven‑year contract have now 
commenced, with outpatient services 
starting in late October 2008 and 
the first inpatient procedures being 
carried out in early November 2008. 
The range of procedures to be 
provided covers specialties including 
orthopaedics, oral, urology, ENT , 
gynaecology, ophthalmology and 
general surgery, as well as a 
number of endoscopies. This 
project demonstrates the benefits 
of independent sector development 
and management of existing NHS 
infrastructure, an area of particular 
interest to NHS management.
The key focus in the Health Care 
business is to achieve continuity 
of the group’s Wave 1 ISTC centres 
beyond their initial contracted 
periods. In particular, we are 
exploring the opportunity both 
to recover the residual capital 
investment value and to continue 
to operate the centres through a 
leasehold arrangement with the 
respective PCTs. Since gaining 
full ownership of PHG we have 
been encouraged by the positive 
disposition of both the DoH 
and the commissioning PCTs and 
their clear interest in determining 
mutually agreeable terms. We hope 
to make further, substantive progress 
in the first half of the current 
financial year. As part of this 
process, we are also seeking 
opportunities to expand and 
enhance the services provided in 
95%
excellent or 
very good overall 
patient experience 
in PHG’s four ISTCs 
_2_CUK_ar08_section1_review.indd   16 19/12/2008   16:04:03 Care UK Plc Annual report and accounts 2008 17
each centre so that they become 
ever more important contributors 
to the local health economies.
Generally in Health Care, we are 
encouraged by the NHS strategy, 
supported by the policies of both 
Labour and Conservative Parties, 
to introduce a wider range of 
non‑NHS providers to stimulate 
competition and by the drive to 
empower patients with greater 
freedom to choose the provider 
of their choice. The intention to 
migrate service provision from 
PCT Provider Arms to non‑NHS 
organisations is seen as the next 
significant step in establishing a 
mixed economy of service providers. 
This is driving behavioural change 
across the NHS at a remarkable 
rate and we are pleased to have 
established a number of entry 
points and service competencies 
that we expect to leverage during 
the coming years.

The 2008 financial year has 
seen another year of strong 
performance for Care UK with 
a growing contribution from 
the group’s Health Care activities, 
a generally solid performance in 
Social Care and the important 
strategic acquisition of the 50% 
of PHG not previously owned. 
The good cash flow performance, 
sound property asset base and 
funding headroom give the 
group a good platform from 
which to continue to seek growth 
opportunities, both organic and 
through selective acquisitions.
Overview
The group’s results show 
revenue, including the group’s 
share of joint venture revenue, 
of £341.6m (2007: £275.7m), 
an increase of 24%, and adjusted 
operating profit of £36.4m 
(2007: £30.4m), an increase 
of 20%. Adjusted profit before 
tax was £24.1m (2007: £20.1m), 
an increase of 20%. Overall group 
profit before tax was £1.6m 
(2007: £14.5m) reflecting the 
£15.9m of non‑cash impairment 
_2_CUK_ar08_section1_review.indd   18 19/12/2008   16:04:10 Care UK Plc Annual report and accounts 2008 19
charges taken in the first half in 
relation to the terminated West 
Midlands diagnostics contract. 
The group’s forward contracted 
revenue has increased to £1.5bn at 
30 September 2008 (2007: £1.2bn).
Operating performance
The group’s underlying operating 
performance is shown in the table 
opposite as “adjusted operating 
profit”, reflecting three adjustments 
for 2008. In addition, in 2007, this 
measure excluded the integration 
and restructuring costs incurred 
following the acquisition of 
Mercury Health in April 2007.
Amortisation of IFRS 3 
“Intangible Assets”
Under IFRS 3 all business 
combinations are reviewed in 
order to identify any intangible 
assets required to be recognised. 
Such intangible assets are then 
amortised over their estimated 
useful lives. The non‑cash 
amortisation charge for 
the year amounted to £5.0m 
(2007: £2.5m), the increase 
from the prior year reflecting the 
annualisation of acquisitions made 
in 2007, particularly Mercury Health, 
as well as the charge arising from 
acquisitions made in 2008.
Impairment of goodwill 
and intangible assets 
All goodwill and IFRS 3 intangible 
assets are subject to impairment 
reviews carried out on an annual 
basis or where evidence of 
impairment is considered 
to exist. The termination of 
the West Midlands diagnostics 
contract, referred to in the 
Chairman’s statement and 
below, required an impairment 
review to be carried out in the 
first half of the 2008 financial 
year in relation to the carrying 
value of those assets formerly 
employed in the diagnostics 
business. As a result of this 
review, impairment charges 
have been recognised of £13.9m 
in relation to goodwill arising on 
the acquisition of Mercury Health 
and £2.0m, in relation to the 
intangible asset recognised for 
the West Midlands diagnostics 
customer contract. These amounts 
are unchanged from those included 
in the group’s half year results.
Joint venture net financing 
costs and taxation
Adopted IFRS requires 
that contributions from 
joint ventures are shown on 
an after‑tax basis as a single 
line component of operating 
profit in the income statement. 
In calculating underlying operating 
performance, the joint venture net 
financing costs and taxation have 
been added back; these items 
are fully taken into account in 
calculating adjusted earnings per 
share. Following the acquisition 
of the 50% of PHG not previously 
owned on 1 August 2008, the 
group no longer has any joint 
venture interests.
Taxation
Under adopted IFRS the group’s 
share of the taxation charge of 
joint venture interests is deducted 
in arriving at the net disclosed 
result for the group’s joint 
venture interest. The group’s 
headline rate of tax on pre‑tax 
profit is not a relevant statistic 
for 2008 as a result of the 
non‑qualifying nature of the

Taxation continued
goodwill impairment charge 
taken in the first half year and 
referred to below. The headline 
tax charge also includes the 
deferred tax credit accounted 
for under IAS 12, which arises in 
respect of the amortisation and 
impairment of other intangible 
assets recorded in the income 
statement. The more significant 
tax measure is the underlying tax 
rate that reflects the tax charge 
applying to the adjusted profit 
before taxation. In 2008 this rate 
was 33.7% (2007: 29.9%), in line 
with the rate reported in the half 
year results. The underlying rate 
remains above the statutory 
rate, which averaged 29% for 
2008, mainly as a result of the 
proportion of the group’s capital 
expenditure that is non‑qualifying 
for tax purposes.
Earnings per share
Adjusted basic earnings per share 
were 27.92p (2007: 26.26p). 
The total basic loss per share 
was 4.98p (2007: earnings 
of 20.27p). Under the provisions 
of IAS 33, the average number 
of shares used for calculating 
diluted earnings per share does 
not change where basic earnings 
per share are negative and the 
calculation of any alternative 
diluted earnings per share 
measure must use the same 
average number of shares 
as the total diluted calculation. 
Consequently, adjusted diluted 
earnings per share were also 27.92p 
(2007: 25.97p) and the total diluted 
loss per share was also 4.98p 
(2007: earnings of 20.04p).
Dividends
The board is proposing a final 
dividend of 3.10p per share 
(2007: 2.80p), which will be 
paid on 18 February 2009 to 
shareholders on the register on 
23 January 2009. If approved by 
shareholders, this would result in 
a total dividend in respect of the 
year of 4.43p (2007: 4.02p) 
when added to the interim 
dividend of 1.33p per share 
(2007: 1.22p) paid in July 2008. 
At 30 September 2008 a total of 
519,140 shares (30 September 2007: 
532,617) were held by the group’s 
Employee Benefit Trust, on which 
dividend payments are waived. 
The group has put in place a 
Dividend Re‑investment Plan 
to enable shareholders to 
choose to re‑invest dividends 
in market purchases of further 
shares rather than be taken 
in cash.
acquisition of PhG
On 1 August 2008 the group 
announced the completion 
of the acquisition of the 50% 
of PHG not previously owned 
from Life Healthcare Group 
(Proprietary) Ltd. The initial 
consideration for this transaction 
was £14.2m, which was financed 
by a share placing of 4,666,666 
new ordinary shares. The total

fund payment of the contingent 
consideration of £2.0m that 
becomes payable to Life 
Healthcare in the event that 
any one of PHG’s existing four 
operational centres continues 
to deliver services following the 
expiry of their initial contract. 
The group has provided for this 
payment in full as it is expected 
to become payable. 
On acquisition, the PHG balance 
sheet showed net assets of £12.0m, 
including net debt of £25.1m. 
Limited fair value adjustments 
have been made, principally 
to align the acquired current 
and deferred tax provisions. 
In addition, an intangible asset 
of £11.1m has been recognised 
in relation to customer contracts 
in accordance with IFRS 3, 
together with the related 
deferred tax provision of £3.1m. 
The asset and related deferred 
taxation will both be amortised 
over the remaining lives of the 
underlying contracts, which 
average 4.8 years.
Compensation claims
The group has been in 
negotiation with the DoH 
for some time regarding 
the compensation claim raised 
following the DoH’s termination 
of the West Midlands diagnostics 
contract. A payment of £10.0m 
was received in July 2008 and a 
further interim payment has been 
received in October 2008. The 
group is seeking to bring this 
matter to a final conclusion 
at the earliest opportunity.
In addition, compensation claims 
have been submitted for abortive 
bid and development costs where 
the DoH has either withdrawn 
or substantially changed Phase 2 
ISTC contracts for which the group 
was appointed preferred bidder, 
including the Essex Electives 
Phase 2 ISTC contract under which 
Mercury Health had been appointed 
preferred bidder. We continue 
to negotiate with the DoH 
and anticipate a satisfactory 
resolution on these claims.
Financing, treasury 
and cash flow
Total net debt increased during 
the period by £9.9m to £180.2m. 
This increase includes the net debt 
of £25.1m acquired with PHG; 
excluding this item, the reduction 
in net debt arising from net positive 
cash flows in the year was £15.7m 
and other non‑cash movements 
increased net debt by £0.5m.
The total borrowing facilities 
available to the group at the 
period end amounted to £273.7m. 
All but £3.0m of this is available 
under committed facilities, with 
£221.0m under the syndicated 
group facility and the balance of 
£49.7m under the non‑recourse

facilities set up to fund the 
Wave 1 ISTC programme. The 
several separate facilities making 
up the latter amount run to various 
expiry dates between March 2010 
and March 2012. These facilities 
will be partly repaid out of the cash 
flows that will be generated through 
the operation of the centres over 
their remaining contracted 
periods, with the residual balance 
of approximately £38.0m structured 
to be repaid on the various expiry 
dates out of the contractually 
guaranteed buyback proceeds 
for the centres, which amount 
to around £54.0m in total.
At 30 September 2008 the 
total funding headroom available 
to the group amounted to over 
£80m, including the £22.9m 
of cash held and after taking 
into account performance 
bonds issued under the 
syndicated group facility. 
The group remains comfortably 
within its key covenants under the 
facility, as set out on the following 
page. It does not currently foresee 
the need to raise additional debt 
financing in order to fund its 
development plans. The group 
syndicated facility is committed 
until February 2015.
Operating cash flow for the year 
was £46.9m, an increase of 44% 
over the equivalent figure in 2007 
of £32.5m. This represents a 
cash conversion ratio, measured 
against adjusted operating profit 
excluding share of profit of joint 
venture, of 147% (2007: 128%). 
This compares favourably with 
the group’s target for this 
measure of around 120%.
Net stakeholder cash flows (interest, 
tax, dividends and equity issues) 
represented a net outflow of 
£17.8m (2007: £11.7m). 
Maintenance and infrastructure 
capital expenditure absorbed £6.2m 
(2007: £4.1m), disposal proceeds 
were £1.8m (2007: £0.7m) and 
loan repayments totalling £5.9m 
(2007: £0.6m) were received 
from PHG prior to the acquisition 
of the 50% of the business not 
previously owned. The free cash 
flow available for discretionary 
investment consequently 
amounted to £30.6m

Against this available free cash flow 
the discretionary investment in the 
year in new services amounted 
to £14.9m (2007: £40.6m). 
This comprised capital expenditure 
of £10.5m (2007: £13.0m) and cash 
consideration for the acquisition 
of businesses of £4.4m (2007: 
£27.6m). In addition, net debt 
of £25.1m (2007: £31.0m) came 
with the business acquired during 
the year. The project related capital 
expenditure in the year was lower 
than expected largely as a result 
of timing factors on the ISTC 
Phase 2 projects, particularly the 
Manchester CATS service. Two small 
homecare acquisitions, Badminton 
Healthcare and Robnet, were 
completed during the year for 
combined consideration of £2.8m 
and approximately £1.0m was paid 
as contingent consideration for 
businesses acquired in prior years.
The group continues to follow a 
policy of having a high proportion 
of its borrowings subject to interest 
rate hedging arrangements. At 
30 September 2008 the total 
drawn debt, excluding cash and 
cash equivalents and finance leases 
was £203.7m, split between the 
group’s syndicated facility (£154.0m) 
and the ring‑fenced non‑recourse 
facilities set up to finance the 
Wave 1 ISTC programme (£49.7m). 
Of this, a total of £192.4m (95%) 
was subject to effective hedging 
arrangements with £131.4m 
swapped into fixed rates, at an 
average LIBOR rate of 5.09%, and 
£61.0m in “collar” arrangements 
with an average LIBOR floor of 
4.31% and an average LIBOR cap 
of 5.82%.
The group’s interest cover, 
measured in accordance with 
the group’s syndicated facility 
agreement using earnings before 
interest, tax, depreciation and 
amortisation (“EBITDA”) 
increased to 3.7 times for the 
year ended 30 September 2008 
(2007: 3.2 times) compared with 
the group’s covenant requirement 
of a minimum of 3.0 times. 
The ratio of facility utilisation 
to EBITDA, again as measured 
under the group’s syndicated 
facility agreement, reduced to 
4.2 times as at 30 September 2008 
(2007: 5.5 times) compared with 
the covenant requirement of a 
maximum of 6.25 times (this 
covenant requirement reduces 
to a maximum of 5.75 times 
by March 2010).
Future changes 
to adopted iFrs
IFRS is subject to ongoing review 
and revision by the International 
Accounting Standards Board 
and subsequent endorsement 
by the European Union. Care UK 
is continuing to monitor proposed 
changes to IFRS, assessing how 
best practice develops, and 
gauging their impact on the 
group financial statements. 
Shareholders will be kept 
informed as to how such 
changes may impact the 
group’s financial statements.

Report of the directors
for the year ended 30 September 2008
The directors present their report, together with the audited financial statements for the year ended 30 September 2008. 
Principal activities, trading review, and future prospects
The group’s principal activities comprise the provision of a range of health and social care solutions primarily to various 
public sector purchasers.
A general review of the operations of the group and its future prospects is included in the Chairman’s statement, 
Chief Executive’s report and financial review on pages 4 to 23.
Results and dividends
The consolidated income statement is set out on page 44. The loss for the year is £2.9m (2007: £10.8m profit). 
Other movements are set out in the statement of recognised income and expense on page 45; movements 
in reserves are shown in note 20 of the financial statements. 
The Key Performance Indicators (“KPIs”) used by the group to measure its own performance are revenue, adjusted operating 
profit, adjusted earnings per share, operating cash flow and net debt. The figures for the year ended 30 September 2008 
are set out in the operational and financial highlights on page 1 together with the figures for the previous year and are 
discussed in the financial review on pages 18 to 23. At divisional level the KPIs include divisional revenue, adjusted operating 
profit, adjusted operating margin and, depending on the specific division, bed numbers and occupancy, hours of care provided, 
procedures delivered, forward contracted revenue and growth, both organically, and by acquisition. The KPIs for each division 
are discussed in the Chief Executive’s report on pages 8 to 17.
The directors recommend the payment of a final dividend of 3.10p per share (2007: 2.80p), making a total dividend for the 
year of 4.43p per share (2007: 4.02p), amounting to £2.5m (2007: £2.3m). The final dividend will, subject to shareholders’ 
approval, be paid on 18 February 2009 to shareholders on the register at 23 January 2009. The final dividend proposed 
was not included as a liability as at 30 September 2008, in accordance with IAS 10 “Events After the Balance Sheet Date”.
Corporate Social Responsibility (“CSR”)
The nature of Care UK’s services mean that the group is driven by a commitment to providing high quality care to patients 
and service users. Underpinning this is a belief that to be a socially responsible organisation also requires engagement 
with staff and the wider community of stakeholders in defining how the group behaves and operates.
Our approach
Care UK’s approach to CSR is driven by three elements:
A integration;
A beyond compliance; and
A focus.
Integration
Sustainability is often taken to refer exclusively to environmental sustainability. The Care UK CSR strategy explicitly extends the 
concept of sustainability to embrace the wider aspects of economy and society. The way in which the group both originates 
and delivers its services has to sustain the environment but must also be for the long‑term benefit of the economies and 
societies that are impacted. Care UK Plc Annual report and accounts 2008 27
Corporate Social Responsibility (“CSR”) continued
Our approach continued
Integration continued
Underlying this thinking is a commitment to the concept of true sustainability. Meeting this commitment requires integrated 
efforts encompassing several different aspects of corporate activity: a social aspect, fostering fair and honest work practices 
and a respect for human rights; an economic aspect, wherein we pursue sound and efficient management and seek to explain our 
actions by providing adequate disclosure of information; and an environmental aspect, wherein Care UK promotes environmental 
protection initiatives ranging from actions to improve our approach to recycling to reducing our carbon footprint – by improving 
our utilisation of fuel including petrol, gas and electricity. The group will seek to actively and positively integrate the social, 
economic and environmental components of CSR.
As part of our drive for integration we will seek close co‑operation with key clients and partners. In this context we have sent 
a questionnaire to our top 20 suppliers to understand their approach to CSR and compatibility of this with the group’s own 
approach. Everything the group does will reinforce this approach.
Beyond compliance
The issues of CSR, brand and reputation are strongly linked. Demonstrating that the group is a responsible, ethical and 
trustworthy corporate citizen is key.
Compliance with legislation and regulatory requirements is essential. However, the group is looking in the future to go beyond 
compliance where reasonably possible. This will encompass the following:
A  identify what needs to be done to strengthen the group’s compliance and make this part of the group’s day‑to‑day activities; and
A  in the areas of economic, environmental and social sustainability, look for opportunities to select and support projects that 
clearly demonstrate that the group is looking beyond simple compliance. 
Focus
Care UK’s economic and environmental activities are well established. The group intends to build upon this as described above. 
This will create an opportunity to do more in the area of social sustainability, often referred to as community engagement.
Community engagement covers all activities which contribute to the positive development of the societies and communities, 
including their environments, in which a business operates. It can potentially add value in a number of ways – by enhancement 
of the group’s reputation; by building a platform to aid creation and maintenance of important stakeholder relationships; and 
by creating a source of pride for Care UK’s employees, and their families, and a means for facilitating their involvement and 
participation in their communities. 
To date the group has taken a devolved approach to community engagement with individual activities being determined at 
a local level. By introducing a consistent theme the group can better utilise resources in this area and create a focus for maximising 
employee motivation. During 2009 it is intended to introduce a community engagement theme with a focus on supporting 
related activities. A team is currently looking at launching a joined‑up corporate initiative to enable the group to make a 
bigger impact in this area. This will also enable the group to ensure a stronger relationship with our chosen partner(s).
Where Care UK decides to contribute its resources, preferential consideration will be given to projects where the group 
can deliver more than just a financial contribution.
We have set out the group’s future strategy above and major elements of our CSR activity. Set out on the following page 
are some examples of current progress. Care UK Plc Annual report and accounts 2008 28
Corporate Social Responsibility (“CSR”) continued
Supply chain and contractors
The group is working with suppliers of goods and services to assist them in developing sustainable practices and to identify 
best practice. At a group level, our top 20 suppliers by value are being asked about their own CSR processes. 
Developing our current environment policy
A baseline report has been drawn up outlining the direct carbon emissions which Care UK releases through its business practice. 
This includes our carbon footprint from business mileage, gas and electricity consumption and procurement. Our initial work 
has highlighted the need for a more systematic approach to the way we collate data on business mileage. Having established 
this baseline we will now identify ways in which consumption can be reduced on an ongoing basis – through the greater use 
of video conferencing; car sharing; public transport, as well exploring incentives for the use of more economical vehicles.
Working with charities in a more strategic way
In the past year the group has provided over £49,000 to charitable causes, with over £30,000 raised by our own employees 
and matched funding of £19,000. Going forward we will develop a theme to encompass our approach to the charitable and 
voluntary sector. This will enable us to identify and support the wide range of activity our large workforce undertakes in a range 
of areas from volunteering, donating and organising charitable events.
Improving our safety record
We have continued to develop our accident reporting systems at a divisional and group level. All staff injuries are investigated, 
with lessons learned shared throughout the organisation. 
Valuing and developing our people
This year the group has embarked on Project Rainbow, a company‑wide initiative, personally sponsored by the Chief Executive. 
Project Rainbow has four key objectives:
A  to build an organisation focused on attracting, nurturing, growing and retaining the diverse mix of talent our business 
will need in the future; 
A  to create a Care UK work culture that actively embraces, values and respects human difference, and uses the ability 
to relate to the full spectrum of diversity represented in our partner organisations and our customer base; 
A  to enable our leaders to see “a diverse organisation” as a key strategic imperative that will strengthen our future service 
offerings, drive innovation and deliver “competitive edge”; and
A  to help us become ‘an employer of choice’ in our sector, where talented people from diverse backgrounds with a wide 
range of skills, styles and behaviours are attracted to join and build their career with Care UK. 
Employment matters
It is group policy to give fair consideration to the employment needs of disabled people and to comply with current legislation 
with regard to their employment. Wherever practicable, we continue to employ and promote the careers of existing employees 
who become disabled and to consider disabled persons for employment, subsequent training, career development and 
promotion on the basis of their aptitudes and abilities. 
Report of the directors
continued Care UK Plc Annual report and accounts 2008 29
Employee involvement
Management regularly visit the residential homes, treatment centres and local branches and discuss with members of staff 
matters of current interest and concern to the business. In order to encourage employees to become shareholders of the 
company and to participate in the achievements of the group, the company operates a Save As You Earn (“SAYE”) share 
option scheme (see note 21 of the financial statements). Management has developed a series of internal communications 
tools, including email notices, newsletters and “cascade” briefings in order to keep employees informed regarding the progress, 
financial position and commercial issues of the group. Employees have an open invitation to email the Chief Executive with 
ideas and issues.
Clinical governance
With the acquisition of the 50% share of PHG not previously owned, Care UK is now the largest independent sector provider 
of contracted elective surgery to the NHS. Clinical governance is therefore of great importance in ensuring that the delivery of 
high quality, safe care to patients. The group’s governance structures are now well embedded with ownership at local, divisional 
and group levels and effective reporting is established on a range of KPIs. This enables the group to achieve a culture of continuous 
improvement and the board to monitor trends. The group has published an annual report on clinical governance which can 
be found on our website.
As an organisation Care UK has also embraced the final report of Lord Darzi’s “Next Stage Review – High Quality Care For All”. 
This makes it clear that patient choice will be enshrined in a new NHS Constitution and frontline staff are encouraged to initiate 
and lead change which improves the quality of care for patients. The group take both of these matters very seriously, and is 
proud to report very high levels of patient satisfaction in our primary and secondary care services – in PHG ISTCs overall satisfaction 
was 95% across the board with a range of 87 to 97%. The Residential Care division is working with service users and their 
relatives to understand how services can better meet their needs. 
Healthcare associated infections 
Once again there has been no MRSA or clostridium difficile acquired in any of our ISTCs. The group has also undertaken 
a pandemic influenza table‑top planning exercise involving all of the divisions.
Health and safety
Health and safety is a key part of the group’s day‑to‑day business. Care UK is committed to maintaining the highest possible 
standards as the group recognise that this is of paramount importance to the well‑being of service users, employees, customers 
and other stakeholders.
With the assistance of a nationally‑recognised organisation, we are conducting a major audit aimed at improving the strategic 
management of health and safety, ensuring that it is integral to our service delivery, minimising the risk of injury or ill health 
and promoting organisational learning.
The group will continue to maintain and improve its existing safety management systems and ensure that all necessary resources 
are provided, with appropriate management systems and training in place, to support health and safety related policies.
Following a review of current arrangements, Care UK has retained Connaught Compliance to provide group‑wide health and 
safety support services. Connaught is the UK’s leading provider of integrated compliance services and we have jointly conducted 
a cross‑section audit of all divisions. This has informed the development of the group’s health and safety action plan, based 
on the industry best practice health and safety standard, HSG 65.  Care UK Plc Annual report and accounts 2008 30

Principal risks and uncertainties
The board has overall responsibility for the group’s approach to assessing risk and recognises that creating value is the reward 
for taking, and accepting, risk. Executive management implement the board’s policies on risk and control and present assurance 
on compliance with these policies. The external auditor and central compliance functions, such as internal audit, clinical 
governance and health and safety, which have group‑wide remits, provide further independent assurance to the board. 
This system is designed to manage rather than eliminate the risk of failing to achieve corporate objectives. Accordingly, 
it can only provide reasonable and not absolute assurance against material misstatement or loss.
Further information is provided on internal controls in the report on corporate governance on page 34 and on accounting 
estimates and judgements in the accounting policies section of these financial statements.
Loss of revenue from contracts with UK Local Authorities, PCTs and other NHS trusts
A substantial proportion of the group’s revenue derives from publicly funded bodies such as Local Authorities, PCTs and other 
NHS Trusts. The group expects to continue to rely on the ability and willingness of Local Authorities, PCTs and other NHS Trusts 
to pay for the group’s services. There are risks that either budget constraints or other financial pressures could cause such publicly 
funded bodies to allocate less money to the types of service that the group provides or that political or policy changes mean 
that fewer such services are contracted from independent sector providers. Also, in common with the majority of government 
funded service providers, most of the group’s price changes take effect annually on 1 April. Around 40% of the group’s revenue 
is linked to general inflation indices such as the Retail Price Index (“RPI”) or Retail Prices Index minus mortgage interest payments 
(“RPIX”). Current economic forecasts indicate deflation during some part of the calendar year 2009, which may have an adverse 
impact on the expected level of the group’s revenue for the second half of the 2009 financial year and the following financial 
year. The group believes that a substantial proportion of this revenue risk will be capable of mitigation through cost management.
Manchester CATS Phase 2 ISTC contract
In June 2008 the group signed the seven‑year Phase 2 ISTC contract for the provision of CATS services to NHS patients 
in Greater Manchester. Services under this contract are due to commence in early 2009. The contract requires significant 
capital expenditure and will also require a complex implementation plan to be delivered to a challenging timescale. 
Should the capital investment required for this project overrun, the group does not have any contractual right to recover 
such overspend. Should the implementation timetable not be achieved the group could face revenue deductions or other 
financial penalties as a result and would also have a shorter contract period. The directors believe that the group has 
sufficient resource and expertise to deliver this project in accordance with its contractual obligations.
Compensation claims in respect of the termination of the West Midlands diagnostics contract and wasted bid costs 
incurred on Phase 2 ISTC contracts
The group has submitted claims to the DoH for compensation in relation to the terminated West Midlands diagnostics contract 
and certain Phase 2 ISTC projects where abortive or excess costs have been incurred. The group is currently carrying amounts 
on the consolidated balance sheet that it believes will be recovered by way of such compensation claims. Should the group 
be unsuccessful in obtaining the level of payment that it is currently expecting it would be necessary for any shortfall to be 
recognised in the group’s income statement.
Failure to comply with regulation and increased regulatory costs
All of the group’s services are subject to a high level of regulation by various regulatory bodies. New regulations may 
be introduced that could impose increased costs on the group’s operations. The group is unable to predict the content 
of new legislation and regulations and their effect on its business. Whilst the group would seek to recover such costs from its 
customers, there can be no assurance that the group’s operations will not be adversely affected by regulatory developments.
Inspections by regulators are carried out on both an announced and unannounced basis dependent on the specific regulatory 
provisions relating to different care services. The failure to comply with government regulations, the receipt of a negative report 
that leads to a determination of regulatory non‑compliance or the failure of the group to cure any defect noted in an inspection 
report could result in the revocation of the registration of any service or a decrease in, or cessation of, the services provided 
by the group. Regulatory action could also result in the group deciding to cease providing a service or close a particular 
service because of negative publicity. Care UK Plc Annual report and accounts 2008 31
Principal risks and uncertainties continued
Failure to comply with regulation and increased regulatory costs continued
In addition, regulatory action in relation to one or more of the group’s services or the group itself, regardless of the merit or 
the eventual outcome, may have a material adverse effect upon the group’s reputation and its ability to attract and/or retain 
customers and/or service users, expand its business or seek registrations for new services, either nationally or within the area 
in which the service which is subject to the regulatory action is located.
The group conducts regular internal governance audits of safety and compliance with regulatory requirements.
Negative publicity
Many of the group’s service users, particularly those within the Social Care businesses, are considered as vulnerable and often 
require substantial supervision. There is a risk that one or more service users could be harmed by one or more of the group’s 
employees, either intentionally or through negligence, or by accident. A serious incident involving harm to one or more service 
users could result in negative publicity as could a similar incident relating to the provision of healthcare services. Any such 
negative publicity or harm to the group’s reputation could impact on the scale of the group’s services, thereby adversely 
affecting the group’s results of operations, growth prospects and financial condition.
The group carries out employment reference procedures and detailed multi‑level business review processes. The group also 
deploys public relations resources to manage both positive and potential negative news.
The group maintains appropriate liability insurance to cover large claims arising from lawsuits alleging negligence, malpractice 
or mistreatment.
Multi‑year contracts
The group undertakes multi‑year contracts. This exposes the businesses to the risks of: 
A  increases in costs, including wage inflation, attributable to such contracts beyond those anticipated and provided 
for within such contracts at the time they are entered into; or
A  being bound to fulfil an onerous contract as a result of inaccurate pricing and forecasting by the group; and
A  increases in cost that are not met through corresponding attributable increases in revenues from such contracts;
unless, and to the extent that, such increases are taken into account in periodic benchmarking and/or market testing where 
included in such contracts. Any such losses may affect the group’s future revenues and profitability in the relevant businesses.
Contracts of significance
The group is party to significant contracts with UK Local Authorities, PCTs, other NHS Trusts and providers of its debt 
financing. These contracts are discussed in detail in the Chairman’s statement, Chief Executive’s review and the financial 
review on pages 4 to 23.
Financial risk management
Refer to note 22 for disclosure of the group’s financial risk management policies and procedures.
Charitable and political donations
The group supports a number of charities through a community support scheme. During the year it made charitable 
donations of £19,000 (2007: £21,000). No political donations were made in the year (2007: £nil).  Care UK Plc Annual report and accounts 2008 32

charges and finance charges, therefore disclosure of the number of billing days outstanding to suppliers by the company 
is not relevant.
Auditor
A resolution to reappoint KPMG Audit Plc as auditor will be proposed at the forthcoming annual general meeting. Care UK Plc Annual report and accounts 2008 33
Authority to purchase shares
The authority given at last year’s annual general meeting of the company held on 6 February 2008 for the company 
to purchase in the market 5,658,000 of its shares, representing approximately 10% of the issued share capital, expires 
on 5 February 2009. This authority was not used during the year and shareholders will be asked to give a similar authority 
at the forthcoming annual general meeting.
Annual general meeting
The notice of the annual general meeting is set out on pages 93 to 95. The attention of shareholders is drawn to the notes 
forming part of the notice of the annual general meeting.
Share capital and control
The following information is given pursuant to Section 992 of the Companies Act 2006.
There are no restrictions on the voting rights attached to the company’s ordinary shares or the transfer of securities in 
the company. No person holds securities in the company carrying special rights with regard to control of the company. 
Further details of the rights, restrictions and obligations attaching to the share capital of the company, including voting rights, 
are contained in the company’s Articles of Association. The Articles of Association may only be changed with the agreement 
of shareholders. Shares acquired through the company’s Long Term Incentive Plan (“LTIP”) and SAYE schemes rank pari passu 
with shares in issue and have no special rights.
On a takeover, awards to directors and employees under the company’s share schemes may vest.
The company is party to significant agreements with UK Local Authorities, PCTs, other NHS Trusts and providers of debt 
finance that would take effect, alter or terminate upon a change of control following a takeover bid.
Going concern
As discussed in the financial review on pages 21 to 22 the group had borrowing facilities available at the period end of £273.7m. 
All but £3.0m of this is available under committed facilities. At 30 September 2008 the group had total funding headroom 
of over £80m, including £22.9m of cash held, which it considers more than sufficient to fund current development plans.
Approval of report
The directors who held office at the date of approval of this directors’ report confirm that, so far as they are each aware, 
there is no relevant audit information of which the company’s auditor is unaware and each director has taken all the steps 
that he ought to have taken as a director to make himself aware of any relevant audit information and to establish that 
the company’s auditor is aware of that information.
This report was approved by order of the board.

The directors acknowledge the principles set out in the Combined Code issued in 2006 by the Committee on Corporate Governance 
and intend to comply with the main provisions thereof. The company has complied with the provisions of the Combined Code 
throughout the year.
The company applies the principles of the Combined Code in the following ways:
Internal control
The directors are responsible for the group’s system of internal controls and for reviewing its effectiveness. The internal control 
systems are designed to meet the group’s particular needs and manage the risks to which it is exposed, and by its nature 
can only provide reasonable, but not absolute, assurance against misstatement or loss.
The Combined Code requires that the directors’ review the effectiveness of the group’s system of internal controls. 
This requirement extends this review to cover all controls, including:
A financial;
A operational;
A compliance; and
A risk management.
The directors confirm that there is an ongoing process for identifying, evaluating and managing the risks faced by the group, 
that has been in place for the year under review, and that this process is regularly reviewed by the directors, and accords with 
the Turnbull guidance.
The group operates in the care sector, one of the most closely monitored and regulated areas of business. Its services are subject 
to external inspections by registration and other authorities, which are followed up by publicly available reports. It also regularly 
conducts its own internal inspections.
With regard to financial matters, the group operates within a control environment, designed to provide reasonable assurance 
regarding the safeguarding of assets against unauthorised use or disposition, the maintenance of proper accounting records 
and the reliability of financial information used within the business or for publication. 
Key established procedures are:
A the definition of the organisation structure and the appropriate delegation of responsibility to operational management;
A the definition of authorisation limits, both financial and otherwise;
A written operational procedures;
A  a system of financial reporting encompassing an annual budget, updated forecasts and the monthly reporting of actual 
results measured against both budget and forecast; and
A  the regular assessment of risks facing the business and the reporting of operational performance to the board, including 
internal and external clinical audit reports.
The group’s Finance Director oversees the group’s risk assessment process. The senior management of the operating divisions 
regularly review the systems of internal control in their respective divisions, which are supported by assessments of key business 
risks, controls and resulting exposures, and confirm their compliance with them. These assessments are reviewed by the 
Finance Director and are subsequently reported to the group Executive Committee and the Audit Committee. 
The Audit Committee assists the board in fulfilling its oversight responsibilities, primarily reviewing the systems of internal 
control and risk management, and the audit process. The external auditor attends all relevant meetings.
The group has in place a formal internal audit function. The function reports to the Finance Director but with direct access 
to the Audit Committee. The Audit Committee approve the annual internal audit strategy and plan and approve the amount 
of resources allocated to the internal audit function.
The directors confirm that they have reviewed the effectiveness of the group’s system of internal controls utilising, inter alia, 
the procedures identified above.

Going concern
After making enquiries the directors, at the time of approving the financial statements, have formed the judgement that the 
group has adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future. For this reason, they continue 
to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the financial statements.
The statement of directors’ responsibilities for preparing the financial statements is set out on page 43.
The board of directors
At 30 September 2008 the board comprised the non‑executive Chairman, the Chief Executive, the Finance Director and four 
non‑executive directors. The directors’ biographies appear on page 25 and detail their experience ensuring an effective board 
to lead and manage the group. All of the non‑executive directors, other than the Chairman, are considered by the board as 
being independent, and Fritz Ternofsky has been identified as the Senior Independent Director.
The non‑executive directors have made arrangements to meet at least annually without the Chairman present, in order to 
review and evaluate the performance of the board, its principal committees and the Chairman. The non‑executive directors 
seek, and take into account, the views of the Chief Executive in carrying out this review.
All directors have access to the Company Secretary and may take independent advice at the group’s expense. The board 
meets regularly and has adopted a schedule of matters reserved for its decision. The board has established three committees 
with defined terms of reference as detailed below. The terms of reference of each of these committees are available on our 
website www.careuk.com.
Eleven board meetings were held during the year. Attendance at these meetings is disclosed on page 36 of this annual report.
Remuneration Committee
The Remuneration Committee is chaired by James Strachan and also comprises Fritz Ternofsky, Michael Averill and Miles Roberts. 
The Committee recommends the remuneration of the executive directors, including the granting of share awards and service 
contracts. The Chairman of the Remuneration Committee will be available at the annual general meeting on 11 February 2009 
to answer any questions regarding remuneration. The directors’ remuneration report appears on pages 37 to 42.
Nominations Committee
The Nominations Committee comprises John Nash, Miles Roberts, Fritz Ternofsky, James Strachan, Michael Averill and Mike Parish 
and is chaired by John Nash. The principal function of the Committee is to lead the process for board appointments by reviewing 
at least annually the structure, size and composition of the board and making recommendations with regard to any changes. 
This includes evaluation of the balance of skills, knowledge and experience on the board and an annual review of the time 
required from, and performance evaluation of, non‑executive directors. In doing so the Committee gives full consideration 
to succession planning in the context of the challenges and opportunities facing the group.
Audit Committee
The Audit Committee is chaired by Miles Roberts and also comprises Fritz Ternofsky and Michael Averill. The Committee has 
direct access to the group’s external and internal auditor and liaises with executive management to review the effectiveness 
of internal controls.
Under its terms of reference, the Audit Committee monitors the integrity of the group’s financial statements. The Committee 
is responsible for monitoring the effectiveness of the external audit process and making recommendations to the board in 
relation to the appointment, reappointment and remuneration of the external auditor. It is responsible for ensuring that an 
appropriate relationship between the group and the external auditor is maintained, including reviewing non‑audit services 
and fees. The group has agreed a policy on non‑audit work, which sets out monetary limits for work that may be undertaken 
by the external auditor, in order to safeguard audit independence. The Committee also reviews annually the group’s systems 
of internal control and the processes for monitoring and evaluating the risks facing the group. The Committee reviews its 
terms of reference and its effectiveness annually and recommends to the board any changes required as a result of the review. Care UK Plc Annual report and accounts 2008 36

A  reviewing an annual report on the group’s systems of internal control and its effectiveness and reporting to the board 
on the results of the review.
Relations with shareholders
The board understands the need for communication with both institutional and private shareholders. In addition to general 
presentations after the publication of the group’s interim and final results the Chief Executive and Finance Director meet 
regularly with fund managers, analysts and institutional investors. The company’s annual general meeting provides a forum 
for all shareholders to attend and put questions to the board. All resolutions are proposed separately. All results statements, 
company announcements and investor presentations are accessible to all shareholders via the group’s website, www.careuk.com.

Unaudited information
Composition and role of the Remuneration Committee
The Remuneration Committee (“the Committee”) is chaired by James Strachan and also comprises Fritz Ternofsky, Michael Averill 
and Miles Roberts. All members of the Committee are independent non‑executive directors. The Committee has access to advice 
provided by the Chief Executive and the Group Human Resources Director and has access to its own independent advisors. 
The Committee also receives advice from Hewitt New Bridge Street Consultants LLP on the remuneration packages for executive 
directors and the structure of annual bonus and long‑term incentive arrangements. No director or senior executive is involved 
in any matter relating to their own remuneration. The Committee’s terms of reference are available on the company’s website 
and on request from the Company Secretary. This report explains how the company has applied the principles in the Combined 
Code on Corporate Governance that relate to directors’ remuneration. It will be submitted to the forthcoming annual general 
meeting for approval.
Framework and policy on executive directors’ remuneration
The policy of the Committee is to ensure that the remuneration packages offered to the executive directors are competitive 
and designed to attract, retain and motivate executive directors and senior executives of a high calibre. In addition, the 
performance‑linked elements are designed to ensure that the executives are aligned to the business strategy and the interests 
of shareholders. Accordingly, a significant proportion of the remuneration package depends on the attainment of certain 
objectives, both short and long‑term. These packages are reviewed regularly, at least annually, and independent advice is taken 
where appropriate. Following a significant review which led to changes to the policy with effect from the 2008 financial year, 
there has been no significant changes to the policy for the 2009 financial year.
Basic salary
The Committee meets at least once a year in order to consider and set the annual salaries for executive directors. Remuneration 
is considered with regard to personal performance and independently compiled salary summary information, and is commensurate 
with their responsibilities and experience. The Committee also recognises the policy adopted generally regarding remuneration 
across the group in determining the appropriate arrangements for senior executives. During the year under review the base 
salary levels were increased by 7% and 15% for the Chief Executive and Finance Director respectively. These rises were considered 
appropriate recognising the performance of the company and overall market relativities.
Incentive arrangements
Annual performance related bonuses
Key senior executives participate in an annual bonus plan under which a maximum of 75% of base salary may be earned. 
For 75% of the bonus potential, a profit before tax target range is set, with maximum bonus payable only for the achievement 
of a stretching level of performance in relation to the target. The remaining 25% of the annual bonus potential comprises 
Strategic Enhancement Targets, which take the form of a number of key strategic objectives for each executive to 
individually achieve. The achievement of each of these performance conditions has a strong link to improvement 
in company financial performance.
One‑third of the total annual bonus is in the form of deferred shares in the company, which must be held for at least two 
further years and are only awarded subject to continued employment of the executive over the deferral period. A Deferred 
Share Bonus Plan is in place to administer these arrangements.
The Committee consider the annual bonus plan is a market‑competitive bonus scheme, which will provide a significant 
potential reward for the achievement of excellent operating performance, better retention and greater alignment of interest 
between executives and shareholders.
The Committee may also pay additional bonuses on a discretionary basis for particular qualitative aspects of performance. 
These are not predetermined by the Committee; however, any discretionary bonus is subject to the overall bonus cap. 
No bonus payments are pensionable.  Care UK Plc Annual report and accounts 2008 38

Unaudited information continued
Incentive arrangements continued
Long Term Incentive Plan (“LTIP”)
Under the terms of the LTIP , company shares may be awarded each year to participants, on a discretionary basis, subject to 
a maximum of 120% of base salary. Awards during the 2009 financial year will be made in relation to shares worth 120% of 
base salary for the Chief Executive, 100% of base salary for the Finance Director and 75% of base salary for other participants. 
Awards under the LTIP scheme are subject to two performance criteria, the scales relating to which are determined annually 
by the Committee. For the awards made in the 2008 financial year the criteria are (a) growth in Earnings Per Share (“EPS”), 
and (b) Return On Capital Employed (“ROCE”). ROCE is calculated as operating profit divided by average capital employed, 
which is defined as net assets plus net debt less assets in the course of construction. EPS will be determined on the basis 
of adjusted earnings per share as reported in the group’s financial statements. ROCE and EPS growth are measured over a 
fixed three year period. The separate elements of the overall award are calculated independently in determining the overall 
proportion of each award that vests. 
The Committee continues to believe that a blend of EPS and ROCE targets provides a balanced incentive, rewarding growth 
in profitability and a focus on capital employed. The Committee considers that the hurdles are appropriately challenging 
considering the outlook for the next three years. The revised LTIP structure is also considered by the Committee to be fully 
market‑competitive for a growth company.
The sliding scale of performance conditions is as follows:
Vesting level   EPS growth (compound over three years) ROCE (in year three)
Zero vesting   Below RPI +6% Below 14%
Vesting at 25%   At RPI +6%  At 14%
Vesting on a straight‑line 
scale between 25% and 100%  Between RPI +6% and RPI +15% Between 14% and 17%
Vesting at 100%   At or above RPI +15% At or above 17%
Pensions
The group contributes to defined contribution personal pension schemes in respect of the executive directors. None of the 
executive directors are members of any defined benefit pension scheme. The contributions paid in respect of the executive 
directors are detailed below.
Contracts of service and compensation for termination
It is the Committee’s policy that executive directors are employed on rolling contracts subject to twelve months’ notice from 
either party. The existing directors are employed on these terms. There is no provision in any director’s contract for predetermined 
compensation or liquidated damages in the event of early termination, but the company may make payments in lieu of notice 
at its discretion. The Committee would review each case of early termination individually in order to ensure compensation 
settlements are made which are appropriate to the circumstances.

Non‑executive directors
Non‑executive directors are appointed for an initial term of three years, which may be renewed for further terms of up to three 
years thereafter. As with executive directors, non‑executives must stand for re‑election at the first annual general meeting following 
their appointment and at least every three years thereafter.
Non‑executive directors’ fees are determined having regard to the need to attract individuals of the right calibre and experience, 
and the time and responsibilities entailed and the level of fees paid by companies of similar size. The remuneration of the 
Chairman and other non‑executive directors is determined by the board within the limits set out in the Articles of Association. 
None of the non‑executive directors receives any pension contribution or participates in any incentive scheme. All of the 
non‑executive directors’ letters of appointment are for periods not exceeding three years and provide for early termination 
without compensation.
The information provided until this point in the report has not been audited. The further disclosures set out below,

The bonus payable in respect of the 2008 financial year was determined after considering the year‑on‑year increase in profitability of the group, 
together with other qualitative aspects of management performance. Under the annual bonus plan the bonus payable to the Chief Executive 
represented 69% of salary and the bonus to the Finance Director represented 70% of salary.
The deferred bonus payable to executive directors in shares is retained for a period of two years under the provisions of a deferred share bonus plan

Directors’ pensions 
Pension contributions to defined contribution schemes are detailed in the table below. Contributions for the executive directors 
are made at rates of 12.5% of salary for the Finance Director and 15% of salary for the Chief Executive. These contributions 
are subject to HM Revenue and Customs limits. Where such limits would be exceeded, the remaining amount that would 
otherwise have been paid as a pension contribution is provided as a payment in lieu of pension benefits, at the discretion of 
the executive director. A payment of £56,250 (2007: £53,000) was made on this basis to Mike Parish in lieu of pension benefits.

 Award four has been re‑calculated on an adopted IFRS basis so as to ensure that the impact of the change in accounting standards is neutral. 
  Awards four, five and six as detailed in the table above are subject to a range of EPS (compound growth over three years) and ROCE (in year three) 
performance conditions for the separate elements of each award. For award three the range of EPS growth targets was RPI+10% p.a. at threshold 
and RPI+20% p.a. at maximum and ROCE of between 15% and 18%. For awards four and five the range of EPS growth targets is RPI+12% p.a. 
at threshold and RPI+22% p.a. at maximum and ROCE of between 15% and 19.5%. In all cases 40% of the award vests at the threshold and there 
is no opportunity either to change these targets or to remeasure performance after the third year. The targets for award six are set out on page 40.
  Award four made on 22 November 2005 vested on the basis of the group’s results for the year to 30 September 2008 as detailed below. The vesting 
of these awards was subject to an independent review by the company’s auditor.
 EPS –  40.64%: EPS in 2008 was 27.92p (2006: 25.59p) representing annual growth over the three year vesting period of 16.3% pa, or 12.1% 
in excess of RPI growth over the same period; and
 ROCE – Nil: ROCE in 2008 was 13.71% (2007: 13.9%).
 A total of 20.32% of this award vested, being the average of the EPS and ROCE vesting levels, with the balance lapsing as follows:
 A Mike Parish – 16,995 shares vested with a market value of £59,143 at 30 September 2008.
 A Paul Humphreys – 7,399 shares vested with a market value of £25,748 at 30 September 2008. Care UK Plc Annual report and accounts 2008 42

Performance graph
The graph below shows the Total Shareholder Return (“TSR”) performance of the company compared to the TSR of the 
FTSE Small Cap over the last five financial years. The Small Cap has been chosen as the company has been a constituent of this 
index throughout the relevant period and as there are no direct peer comparator companies against which it would be more 
appropriate to measure return. TSR is not used directly for measuring performance under the group’s Long Term Incentive Plan 
as the Committee has determined that the measures used, which are explained above, are more appropriate in assessing the 
delivery of improved shareholder return.
 
In accordance with Schedule 7A to the Companies Act the group’s auditor, KPMG Audit Plc, has audited the sections within 
this directors’ remuneration report on directors’ emoluments, directors’ interests in shares and options over ordinary shares.

Statement of directors’ responsibilities
in respect of the report of the directors and financial statements
The directors are responsible for preparing the annual report and the group and parent company financial statements 
in accordance with applicable law and regulations.
Company law requires the directors to prepare group and parent company financial statements for each financial year. 
Under that law they are required to prepare the group financial statements in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by 
the European Union (“EU”) and applicable law and have elected to prepare the parent company financial statements 
on the same basis. 
The group and parent company financial statements are required by law and IFRSs as adopted by the EU to present fairly 
the financial position of the group and the parent company and the performance for that period; the Companies Act 1985 
provides in relation to such financial statements that references in the relevant part of that Act to financial statements giving 
a true and fair view are references to their achieving a fair presentation.
In preparing each of the group and parent company financial statements, the directors are required to:
A select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently;
A make judgements and estimates that are reasonable and prudent;
A state whether they have been prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the EU; and
A  prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis unless it is inappropriate to presume that the group and the 
parent company will continue in business.
The directors are responsible for keeping proper accounting records that disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial 
position of the parent company and enable them to ensure that its financial statements comply with the Companies Act 1985. 
They have general responsibility for taking such steps as are reasonably open to them to safeguard the assets of the group 
and to prevent and detect fraud and other irregularities.
Under applicable law and regulations, the directors are also responsible for preparing a report of the directors, directors’ 
remuneration report and report on corporate governance that comply with that law and those regulations. 
The directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity of the corporate and financial information included on the 
company’s website. Legislation in the UK governing the preparation and dissemination of financial statements may differ 
from legislation in other jurisdictions.
Directors’ responsibilities statement
We confirm that to the best of our knowledge:
A  the financial statements, prepared in accordance with the applicable set of accounting standards, give a true and fair view 
of the assets, liabilities, financial position and profit or loss of the company and the undertakings included in the consolidation 
taken as a whole; and
A  the directors’ report includes a fair review of the development and performance of the business and the position of the 
company and the undertakings included in the consolidation taken as a whole, together with a description of the principal 
risks and uncertainties that they face.

Cash flow statements
for the year ended 30 September 2008 Care UK Plc Annual report and accounts 2008 48
The significant accounting policies of the group and parent company are set out below.
Accounting policies
The group’s annual consolidated financial statements for the year ended 30 September 2008 are prepared in accordance with International Financial 
Reporting Standards adopted for use within the EU (“adopted IFRS”), International Financial Reporting Interpretations Committee (“IFRIC”) interpretations 
and those parts of the Companies Act 1985 applicable to companies reporting under IFRS. The directors have elected to prepare the parent company’s 
financial statements on the same basis.
Care UK Plc (“the company”) is a company domiciled in England and Wales. The consolidated financial statements of the company for the year ended 
30 September 2008 comprise the company and its subsidiaries (together referred to as the “group”).
The financial statements were authorised for issue by the directors on 19 December 2008.
(a) Statement of compliance
The financial statements have been prepared in accordance with adopted IFRS.
(b) Basis of preparation
The financial statements have been prepared on the historical cost basis or fair value as appropriate, except that certain land and buildings have 
previously been revalued and are stated at deemed cost.
Non‑current assets held for sale are stated at the lower of their carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell.
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with adopted IFRS requires management to make judgements, estimates and assumptions 
that affect the application of policies and reported amounts of assets and liabilities, income and expenses. The estimates and associated assumptions 
are based on historical experience and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form 
the basis of making the judgements about carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results 
may differ from these estimates. The areas involving a higher degree of judgement or complexity, or areas where assumptions and estimates are 
significant to the financial statements, are disclosed in section (y) below.
The estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the period in 
which the estimate is revised if the revision affects only that period, or in the period of the revision and future periods if the revision affects both 
current and future periods.
The accounting policies set out below have been applied consistently to all periods presented in the financial statements. The accounting policies 
have been applied consistently by group entities.
(c) Basis of consolidation
(i) Subsidiaries
Subsidiaries are entities controlled by the company. Control exists when the company has the power, directly or indirectly, to govern the financial 
and operating policies of an entity so as to obtain benefits from its activities. In assessing control, potential voting rights that presently are exercisable 
or convertible are taken into account. The financial statements of subsidiaries are included in the consolidated financial statements from the date 
that control commences until the date that control ceased.
(ii) Joint ventures
Joint ventures are those entities over whose activities the group has joint control, established by contractual agreement. The consolidated financial 
statements include the group’s share of the profits less losses of joint ventures in the consolidated income statement and its interest in their net 
assets in the consolidated balance sheet in accordance with the equity method of accounting.
(iii) Transactions eliminated upon consolidation
Intragroup balances and any unrealised gains and losses or income and expenses arising from intragroup transactions, are eliminated in preparing 
the consolidated financial statements. Unrealised gains arising from transactions with jointly controlled entities are eliminated to the extent of the 
group’s interest in the entity. Unrealised losses are eliminated in the same way as unrealised gains, but only to the extent that there is no evidence 
of impairment. 
(d) Foreign currency transactions
Transactions in foreign currencies are translated at the foreign exchange rate ruling at the date of the transaction. Monetary assets and 
liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at the balance sheet date are translated to sterling at the foreign exchange rate ruling at that date. 
Foreign exchange differences arising on translation are recognised in the income statement.
The functional currency of all the group entities is sterling.
Accounting policies Care UK Plc Annual report and accounts 2008 49
Accounting policies continued
(e) Financial instruments
(i) Non‑derivative instruments
Non‑derivative financial instruments comprise trade and other receivables, cash and cash equivalents, loans and borrowings, and trade and other payables.
Non‑derivative financial instruments are recognised initially at fair value. The group has no non‑derivative financial instruments measured at fair 
value through profit or loss. Subsequent to initial recognition non‑derivative financial instruments are measured as described below.
Accounting for cash and cash equivalents is discussed in note (k); interest‑bearing borrowings in note (m); and finance income and expense in 
note (q)(iii). Other non‑derivative financial instruments are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method, less any impairment losses.
(ii) Derivative financial instruments
The group uses derivative financial instruments to hedge its exposure to interest rate risks arising from its financing activities. In accordance with 
its treasury policy, the group does not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading purposes. However, derivatives that do not qualify 
for hedge accounting are accounted for as trading instruments.
Derivative financial instruments are recognised initially and subsequently at fair value. The gain or loss on remeasurement to fair value is recognised 
immediately in profit or loss. However, where derivatives qualify for hedge accounting, recognition of any resultant gain or loss depends on the nature 
of the item being hedged. In order to qualify for hedge accounting, the group is required to document in advance the relationship between the item 
being hedged and the hedging instrument. The group is also required to demonstrate that the hedge is highly effective on an on‑going basis. 
This effectiveness testing is reperformed at each period end to ensure the hedge remains highly effective.
The fair value of interest rate swaps is the estimated amount the group would receive or pay to terminate the swap at the balance sheet date, 
taking into account current interest rates and the current creditworthiness of the swap counterparties.
(iii) Cash flow hedges
Where a derivative financial instrument is designated as a hedge of the variability in cash flows of a recognised asset or liability, the effective part 
of any gain or loss on the derivative financial instrument is recognised directly in equity. The associated cumulative gain or loss is removed from 
equity and recognised in the income statement in the same period or periods during which the hedged forecast transaction affects profit or loss. 
The ineffective part of any gain or loss is recognised immediately in the income statement.
When a hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated or exercised, or the entity revokes designation of the hedge relationship but the hedged 
transaction is still expected to occur, the cumulative gain or loss at that point remains in equity and is recognised in accordance with the above 
policy when the transaction occurs. If the hedged transaction is no longer expected to take place, the cumulative unrealised gain or loss recognised 
in equity is recognised immediately in the income statement.
(iv) Financial guarantee contracts
Where the company enters into financial guarantee contracts to guarantee the indebtedness of other companies within its group, the company 
considers these to be insurance arrangements, and accounts for them as such. In this respect, the company treats the guarantee contract as 
a contingent liability until such time as it becomes probable that the company will be required to make a payment under the guarantee.
(f) Property, plant and equipment
(i) Owned assets
Items of property, plant and equipment are stated at cost and deemed cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses.
Certain items of property that had been revalued to fair value prior to 1 October 2004, the date of transition to adopted IFRS, are measured on 
the basis of deemed cost, being the revalued amount at the date of that revaluation less any subsequent depreciation and impairments. The last 
revaluation, to open market value, of the properties occurred in 1992.
Assets in the course of construction are carried in the financial statements at cost, taken from the most recent surveyor’s cost certificate received prior 
to the date of the financial statements.
Where parts of an item of property, plant and equipment have different useful lives, they are accounted for as separate items of property, 
plant and equipment.
The cost of land and buildings includes both the costs of financing assets in the course of construction and other costs that are directly attributable 
to bringing the asset to the location and condition necessary for it to be capable of operating in the manner intended by management. Capitalisation 
of finance and other costs ceases when substantially all the activities necessary to prepare the qualifying asset for its intended use are complete.  Care UK Plc Annual report and accounts 2008 50

(f) Property, plant and equipment continued
(ii) Leased assets
Where the group enters into a lease which entails taking substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of an asset, the lease is classified as 
a finance lease. The asset acquired by way of finance lease is stated at an amount equal to the lower of its fair value and the present value of the 
minimum lease payments at inception of the lease, less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses. Future instalments under such leases, 
net of finance charges, are included within creditors.
All other leases are accounted for as operating leases.
(iii) Subsequent costs
The group recognises in the carrying amount of an item of property, plant and equipment the cost of replacing part of such an item when that cost 
is incurred if it is probable that the future economic benefits embodied with the item will flow to the group and the cost of the item can be measured 
reliably. All other costs are recognised in the income statement, as an expense, as incurred.
(iv) Depreciation 
Depreciation is charged to the income statement to write off the cost, less estimated residual values, of property, plant and equipment by equal 
instalments over their estimated useful economic lives as follows:
Freehold land     – no depreciation provided 
Freehold buildings     – 25 to 50 years 
Long leasehold buildings    – 50 years or, if shorter, the period of the lease or the associated contract 
Short leasehold buildings    – the shorter of the period of the lease or the associated contract 
Plant and machinery (as an integral part of property assets) – 25 years or, if shorter, the period of the lease 
Motor vehicles     – four years 
Furniture, fittings, medical equipment and office equipment – three to ten years
The residual value, if not insignificant, is reassessed annually.
(v) Pre‑contract costs
Pre‑contract costs include the costs attributable to a contract for the period from the date of securing the contract to the date at which financial 
close is achieved. The award of preferred bidder status is considered as the point at which it is probable that the contract has been secured, although 
contracts are individually reviewed in order to apply the most appropriate treatment. Costs that relate directly to a contract and which are incurred 
in this period are included as part of pre‑contract costs where they can be separately identified and reliably measured. Such amounts are held within 
other debtors until such time as financial close of the contract is achieved, at which time they are transferred to assets in the course of construction.
(g) Intangible assets
(i) Goodwill
All business combinations are accounted for by applying the purchase method. Goodwill represents amounts arising on the acquisition of subsidiaries, 
associates and joint ventures, being the excess of the fair value of the purchase consideration and associated costs and the fair values attributable 
to the net identifiable assets acquired. 
Goodwill is stated at cost less any accumulated impairment losses. Goodwill arising on acquisitions before the date of transition to adopted IFRS 
has been retained at the previous UK GAAP amounts. Goodwill is allocated to cash‑generating units and is not subject to periodic amortisation 
but is tested annually for impairment. As permitted under IFRS 3 “Business Combinations”, the fair value of the assets acquired may be reassessed 
in the instance of further information arising within twelve months from the date of acquisition, provided the initial fair values were determined 
as provisional. 
Negative goodwill arising on an acquisition is recognised directly in the income statement.
(ii) Other intangible assets
Other intangible assets that are acquired by the group are stated at cost less accumulated amortisation and impairment losses.
Expenditure on internally generated goodwill and brands is recognised in the income statement, as an expense, as incurred.
(iii) Amortisation
Amortisation is charged to the income statement on a straight‑line basis over the estimated useful lives of intangible assets unless such lives are 
indefinite. Customer relationships are amortised over their estimated useful economic lives, which will not exceed ten years. Goodwill and intangible 
assets with an indefinite useful life are tested annually for impairment. Intangible assets are amortised from the date they are available for use over 
their estimated useful lives. Care UK Plc Annual report and accounts 2008 51
Accounting policies continued
(g) Intangible assets continued
(iv) Impairment
The carrying amounts of goodwill and intangible assets that have an indefinite useful life are reviewed at each balance sheet date to determine whether 
there is any impairment. The group also reviews the carrying amounts of its depreciable tangible and intangible assets to determine if there is any 
indication that an asset has suffered an impairment loss.
An impairment loss is recognised whenever the carrying amount of an asset or its cash‑generating unit exceeds its recoverable amount. The recoverable 
amount of an asset is the greater of its net selling price and value‑in‑use. In assessing value‑in‑use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted 
to their present value using a pre tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the 
asset. For an asset that does not generate largely independent cash inflows, the recoverable amount is determined for the cash‑generating unit 
to which the asset belongs.
Impairment losses are recognised in the income statement.
(h) Investments in subsidiaries
Investments in subsidiaries are stated at cost less provisions for impairment.
(i) Trade and other receivables
Trade and other receivables are stated at their cost less impairment losses.
(j) Inventories
Inventories are valued at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Net realisable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business, 
less the estimated selling expenses. The cost of inventories is based on a first‑in‑first‑out cost formula.
(k) Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents comprises cash balances and call deposits with an original maturity of three months or less. Bank overdrafts that are 
repayable on demand and form an integral part of the group’s cash management are included as a component of cash and cash equivalents 
for the purpose of the statement of cash flows.
(l) Share capital
(i) Employee Benefit Trust shares
When share capital recognised as equity is acquired by the group’s Employee Benefit Trust (“EBT”), the amount of the consideration paid, 
including directly attributable costs, is recognised as a change in equity. Such shares are presented as a deduction from total equity.
(ii) Dividends
Final dividends are recognised as a liability in the period in which they are approved by the company’s shareholders. Interim dividends 
are recorded in the period in which they are paid.
(m) Interest‑bearing borrowings
Interest‑bearing borrowings are recognised initially at fair value less attributable transaction costs. Subsequent to initial recognition, interest‑bearing 
borrowings are stated at amortised cost with any difference between cost and redemption value being recognised in the income statement over the 
period of the borrowings on an effective interest basis.
(n) Employee benefits
The assets of all pension plans are held separately from those of the group, in independently administered managed funds.
(i) Defined contribution plans
Obligations for contributions to defined contribution pension plans are recognised as an expense in the income statement as incurred. 
(ii) Defined benefit plans
The group’s net obligation in respect of defined benefit pension plans is calculated by estimating the amount of future benefit that employees have 
earned in return for their service in the current and prior periods; that benefit is discounted to determine its present value, and the fair value of any 
plan assets is deducted. The discount rate applied is the yield at the balance sheet date on AA credit rated bonds that have maturity obligations 
approximating to the terms of the group’s obligations. The calculation is performed by a qualified actuary using the projected unit credit method. 
All actuarial gains and losses as at 1 October 2004, the date of transition to adopted IFRS, were recognised. In respect of actuarial gains and losses 
that have arisen subsequent to 1 October 2004, the group recognises all actuarial gains and losses in the statement of recognised income and expense. Care UK Plc Annual report and accounts 2008 52
Accounting policies
continued
Accounting policies continued
(n) Employee benefits continued
(iii) Share‑based payment transactions
The group operates a number of share option schemes. The fair value of options granted is recognised as an employee expense with a corresponding 
increase in equity. The fair value is measured at grant date and spread over the period during which the employees become unconditionally entitled 
to the options. The fair value of the options granted is measured based on the Black‑Scholes formula, taking into account the terms and conditions 
upon which the instruments were granted. The amount recognised as an expense is adjusted to reflect the number of share options that are expected 
to vest.
The group’s LTIP is managed by a separately administered EBT. Liabilities of the EBT are guaranteed by the company and the assets of the EBT 
mainly comprise shares in the company. The assets, liabilities, income and costs of the EBT have been included in the consolidated and company’s 
financial statements. 
Where the parent company awards a subsidiary’s employees options over its own shares, this is treated as a capital contribution and added to the 
cost of the parent company’s investment in its subsidiary.
(o) Trade and other payables
Trade and other payables are stated at cost.
(p) Revenue
(i) Services rendered
Revenue represents the fair value of sales and services to third party customers, stated net of any applicable value added tax, rebates and discounts. 
The stage of completion as defined in IAS 18 “Revenue” is determined by reference to the point at which the group has met its principal contractual 
obligations. Revenue is recognised as follows:
 Social Care
  Residential long‑term contracts – revenue is recognised on a time‑elapsed basis as the principal contractual obligation is to provide bed capacity. 
Units of care under these contracts are typically provided on a daily basis and there is no obligation to carry forward any non‑utilised capacity. 
  Residential spot purchase contracts – revenue is recognised when the group’s principal contractual obligation is fulfilled, that is typically when 
a service user has received care services from the group, which are usually provided on a daily basis.
  Community‑based services – revenue is recognised only on the actual delivery of care services. Revenue attributable to any unused capacity 
under ‘block’ contracts, where the group is able to submit invoices for contracted services that have not actually been provided, is only 
recognised when the recovery of income is considered virtually certain. 
 Health Care
  Capacity‑related contracts – revenue is recognised on a time‑elapsed basis as the principal contractual obligation is to provide an agreed level 
of capacity over a fixed term. There is no obligation under these contracts to carry forward non‑utilised capacity.
  Service‑related contracts – revenue is recognised only on the delivery of services either surgical procedures or other treatments under contractual 
obligations that are intended to provide a pre‑determined volume of services over a fixed term. Revenue attributable to unused capacity is only 
recognised when recovery of income is considered virtually certain. 
 In all businesses when revenue is invoiced in advance this is accounted for as deferred income until the service is provided. 
(ii) Government grants
Capital based Government grants are included within accruals and deferred income in the balance sheet and credited to the income statement 
over the estimated useful economic lives of the assets to which they relate. Grants that compensate the group for expenses incurred are recognised 
as revenue in the income statement on a systematic basis in the same periods in which the expenses are incurred.
(q) Expenses
(i) Operating lease payments
Payments made under operating leases are recognised in the income statement on a straight‑line basis over the term of the lease. Lease incentives 
received are recognised in the income statement as an integral part of the total lease expense.
(ii) Finance lease payments
Minimum lease payments are apportioned between the finance charge and the reduction of the outstanding liability. The finance charge is allocated 
to each period during the lease term so as to produce a constant periodic rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability.
(iii) Net financing costs
Net financing costs comprise interest payable on borrowings calculated using the effective interest rate method, interest receivable on funds invested, 
foreign exchange gains and losses and gains and losses on hedging instruments that are recognised in the income statement.
Interest income is recognised in the income statement as it accrues, using the effective interest method. The interest expense component of finance 
lease payments is recognised in the income statement using the effective interest rate method. Care UK Plc Annual report and accounts 2008 53
Accounting policies continued
(r) Taxation
The charge for taxation is based on the profit or loss for the year and comprises current and deferred taxation. Income tax is recognised 
in the income statement except to the extent that it relates to items recognised directly in equity, in which case it is recognised in equity.
Current tax is the expected tax payable on the taxable income for the year, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet 
date, together with any adjustment to tax payable in respect of previous years.
Deferred tax is provided for temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the 
amounts used for taxation purposes. The following temporary differences are not provided for: the initial recognition of goodwill not deductible 
for taxation purposes, and the initial recognition of assets or liabilities that affect neither accounting nor taxable profit. The amount of deferred 
tax provided is based on the expected manner of realisation or settlement of the carrying amount of assets and liabilities, using tax rates enacted 
or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
A deferred tax asset is recognised only to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which the asset 
can be utilised. Deferred tax assets are reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that the related tax benefit will be realised.
(s) Segment reporting
Care UK operates solely within the UK, hence no geographical segment disclosures are presented.
Segmental information is presented in respect of business segments, based upon management’s internal reporting structure. Further details 
are provided in note 1 to these financial statements.
(t) Non‑current assets held for sale
Immediately before their classification as being held for sale, the measurement of the value of any such assets (and all assets and liabilities in a 
disposal group) is fair valued in accordance with applicable adopted IFRS. On their ensuing initial classification as being held for sale, non‑current 
assets and disposal groups are recognised at the lower of carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell.
Impairment losses on the initial classification of non‑current assets as being held for sale are included in profit or loss, including where there 
has been any revaluation of the asset. The same also applies to gains and losses on subsequent measurement.
(u) Non‑GAAP performance measures 
The board believe that the ‘adjusted’ profit and earnings per share measures provide additional useful information for the shareholders on the 
underlying performance of the business. These measures are consistent with how business performance is monitored internally. The adjusted 
operating profit is not a recognised profit measure under adopted IFRS and may not be directly comparable with ‘adjusted’ profit measures used 
by other companies. The adjustments made to operating profit exclude ‘exceptional’ income and charges, which are predominantly one‑off in nature 
and therefore create volatility in reported earnings.
(v) Diagnostics contract termination
The financial review contains a full description of the accounting treatment adopted in relation to the West Midlands diagnostics contract which 
was terminated by the Department of Health in November 2007.
In accordance with IAS 37 “Provisions, Contingent Liabilities and Contingent Assets”, contingent liabilities have been recognised unless the possibility 
of settlement is remote. Additionally, in accordance with IAS 37, contingent assets reflecting the anticipated reimbursement of claims in negotiation 
have been recognised to the extent that they are virtually certain to result in economic inflows to the group.
(w) New standards effective and applied in these financial statements
The following EU adopted standards, amendments to standards and interpretations effective for the year ended 30 September 2008 have been 
applied in these financial statements:
(i) Amendment to IAS 1 “Presentation of Financial Statements – Capital Disclosures”
(ii) IFRS 7 “Financial Instruments: Disclosures”
(iii) IFRIC 8 “Scope of IFRS 2”
(iv) IFRIC 9 “Reassessment of Embedded Derivatives”
(v) IFRIC 10 “Interim Financial Reporting and Impairment”
(vi) IFRIC 11 “Group and Treasury Share Transactions”
The above new standards, interpretations and amendments to published standards have had no material impact on the results or the financial 
position of the group for year ended 30 September 2008. IFRS 7 has resulted in significant additional disclosures about the significance of financial 
instruments for the group’s financial position and performance, and qualitative and quantitative disclosures on the nature and extent of risks.  Care UK Plc Annual report and accounts 2008 54

(x) New standards and interpretations not yet applied
The following new EU adopted standards, amendments to standards and interpretations are not yet effective for the year ended 30 September 2008, 
and have not been applied in preparing these financial statements:
IFRS 8 “Operating Segments” introduces the “management approach” to segment reporting. IFRS 8, which becomes mandatory for the group’s 
2010 financial statements, will require the disclosure of segment information based on the internal reports regularly reviewed by the board and 
executive in order to assess each segment’s performance and to allocate resources to them. Currently the group presents segment information 
in respect of its business segments (see note 1); these segments are not anticipated to change under the group’s management approach.
The following new EU adopted standards, amendments to standards and interpretations are awaiting endorsement by the EU:
(i)  IFRIC 12 “Service Concession Arrangements” states that for such arrangements the infrastructure assets are not recognised as property, plant 
and equipment of the operator. Rather, depending upon the terms of the arrangement, the operator will recognise a financial asset, an intangible 
asset or both. The group is currently calculating the impact of this interpretation, although it is expected that the profit arising under each service 
contract will be amortised using a different profile with the total profit at the end of the contract remaining the same. The interpretation 
is expected to be endorsed in early 2009 and will be mandatory for the group’s September 2010 financial statements.
(ii)  IFRIC 14 “The Limit of a Defined Benefit Asset” provides guidance on the amount of a pension asset that can be recognised as an asset. 
It concludes that refunds and reductions in contributions are recognisable as assets if they can be realised at some point during the life of 
the pension plan. The group does not consider this interpretation will have a material impact on the group’s financial position. Endorsement 
is expected in late 2008 and as such will be effective for the group’s September 2009 financial statements.
(iii)  Amendments to IAS 1 “Presentation of Financial Statements: A Revised Presentation” proposes changing the content of the income statement 
and the statement of recognised income and expense and includes an opening balance sheet for all periods.
(iv)  Amendment to IAS 23 “Borrowing Costs” removes the choice of treatment for borrowing costs. Under the revised standard borrowing costs 
must be capitalised where the criteria established are met. The group’s existing accounting policy is to capitalise such costs, therefore the 
revised standard is not expected to have an impact on the group’s future financial statements.
(v)  Amendment to IAS 27 “Consolidated and Separate Financial Statements” revises the accounting for changes in the parent’s ownership interest 
in a subsidiary following the revision to IFRS 3 (see below). Endorsement is expected by the end of 2008 and will be effective for the group’s 
September 2010 financial statements.
(vi)  Amendment to IFRS 2 “Share‑based Payment: Vesting Conditions and Cancellations” changes the definition of vesting conditions and clarifies 
the accounting treatment of cancellations by either parties. The definition of vesting conditions is now restricted to either service or performance 
conditions. Any other conditions will be non‑vesting conditions and will be factored into the fair value at the grant date. These amendments 
will impact SAYE schemes. The group is currently considering the potential impact of this amendment. Endorsement is expected by the end 
of 2008 and as such will be effective for the group’s September 2010 financial statements.
(vii)  Revised IFRS 3 “Business Combinations” revises several significant areas in accounting for acquisitions. It determines that the cost of investment 
should reflect the fair value of the consideration received by the vendor and hence acquisition expenses should be expensed as incurred. 
Pre‑existing interests in a step acquisition must be remeasured to fair value when the acquirer obtains control with any resulting gain or loss 
being recognised in the income statement. The revised standard requires contingent consideration is measured at fair value at the acquisition 
date, however subsequent revisions are recognised in the income statement. Retrospective application is not required. This standard will have 
a significant impact on the group’s accounting for future acquisitions. Endorsement is expected in early 2009 and as such will be effective 
for the group’s September 2010 financial statements.
IFRIC 13 “Customer Loyalty Programmes”, IFRIC 15 “Agreements for the Construction of Real Estate”, IFRIC 16 “Hedges of Net Investment in 
a Foreign Operation” and amendments to IAS 32 “Puttable Financial Instruments” and IAS 1 “Obligations Arising on Liquidation” will not have 
a material impact on the group. Care UK Plc Annual report and accounts 2008 55
Accounting policies continued
(y) Significant sources of estimation uncertainty and critical accounting judgements in applying the group’s accounting policies
The preparation of the financial statements in conformity with adopted IFRS requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect 
the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the 
year then ended. Management bases its estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under 
the circumstances. Actual results may differ from those estimates.
Estimates are used in accounting for allowances for uncollectible receivables, depreciation, amortisation and impairment, share‑based payments, 
pensions, taxes and contingencies. Estimates and assumptions are reviewed periodically and the effects of revisions are reflected in the financial 
statements in the period that an adjustment is determined to be required.
Management discussed with the Audit Committee the development, selection and disclosure of the group’s critical accounting policies and estimates 
and the application of these policies and estimates.
Significant accounting judgements in applying the group’s accounting policies have been applied by the group in order to prepare the consolidated 
financial statements with respect to the value of other intangible assets and goodwill (note 10), share‑based payments (note 21), financial instruments 
(note 23) and pensions (note 24) and are described below:
Intangible assets
The group uses forecast cash flow information and estimates of future growth to initially value other intangible assets, to assess whether goodwill 
and other intangible assets are impaired, and to determine the useful economic lives of its intangible assets. If the results of operations in a future 
period are adverse to the estimates used for impairment testing, an impairment charge may be triggered at that point, or a reduction in useful 
economic life may be required.
Share‑based payments
The assumptions used in calculating the fair value of share options has a significant impact upon magnitude of the charge recognised in the income 
statement. Details of the principal assumptions used in calculating the share‑based payments expense are given in note 21. When a grant of share 
awards is made, management review the estimates and assumptions used and update them accordingly.
Derivative financial instruments
The fair value of derivative financial statements is the amount for which an asset could be exchanged or a liability settled between willing parties in 
arm’s length transactions. The fair values of financial instruments are determined by reference to observable market prices where these are available 
and the market is active. Where market prices are not available or are unreliable because of poor liquidity, fair values are determined using valuation 
techniques including cash flow models which, to the extent possible, use observable market parameters. The process of calculating the fair value using 
valuation techniques may necessitate the estimation of certain pricing parameters, assumptions or model characteristics. Changes in assumptions 
about these factors could affect reported fair values of financial instruments.
Pensions
Details of the principal actuarial assumptions used in calculating the recognised liability for the defined benefit plans are given in note 24. 
Changes to the discount rate, mortality rates and actual return on plan assets may necessitate material adjustments to this liability in the future. Care UK Plc Annual report and accounts 2008 56
Notes to the financial statements
1. Segment reporting
Segment information is presented in respect of the group’s business segments. The primary format, business segments, is based on the group’s management 
and internal reporting structure. Care UK operates solely within the UK, hence no geographical segment disclosures are presented.
Inter‑segment pricing is determined on an arm’s length basis.
Segment results, assets and liabilities include items directly attributable to a segment as well as those that can be allocated on a reasonable basis. 
Unallocated items comprise mainly interest‑bearing loans, borrowings and expenses, corporation taxes and corporate assets and expenses.
Business segments
The group comprises the following main business segments:
A Residential Care operates care homes for older people;
A Community Care supports people in their own homes, including older people and others with specialist needs;
A  Specialist Care includes the provision of care for individuals with learning disabilities or mental health needs and children’s residential and foster care; and
A Health Care provides a range of primary and secondary care services.

2.	 Operating 	 profit 	 continued
PHG’s revenue contribution was £10.7m and its contribution to operating profit was £3.4m in the post‑acquisition period.
West Midlands diagnostics termination
On the acquisition of Mercury Health an intangible asset was recognised in relation to the diagnostics customer contract. The termination of the 
contract meant that the diagnostics customer contract and relationship have no future economic value. Consequently an impairment charge of £2.0m 
was recognised in the group income statement for this item. The related deferred tax credit of £0.6m has consequently also been released to the 
income statement.
The termination of this contract required an impairment review to be carried out in relation to the carrying values of those assets formerly employed 
in the diagnostics business. The impairment review resulted in a goodwill impairment charge of £13.9m being recognised in the group income statement 
as a consequence of the termination of the diagnostics contract. There were no tax consequences arising from this impairment. No impairment charge 
was recognised in relation to the net tangible assets of the diagnostics business.
The total impairment charge of £15.9m has been included within administrative expenses.
The impairment charges were non‑cash and non‑recurring items and did not affect the underlying results of the group’s continuing business. 
They also had no effect on the observance of the key financial covenants contained in the group’s banking facility agreements.
The contract provides for compensation to be payable in the event of voluntary termination by the DoH. In accordance with IAS 37, an asset in respect 
of the anticipated reimbursement of claims in negotiation has been recognised only to the extent that there is virtual certainty of economic inflows 
to the group. As a consequence of this arrangement, no impairment charge has been recognised in relation to the residual net assets of the diagnostics 
business including any plant and equipment and capitalised implementation costs incurred.

expenses in the income statement.
The allocation of goodwill to cash‑generating units on acquisitions made in the year ended 30 September 2008 has been completed during the year.
Intangible assets comprise the value attributed to ongoing customer relationships within acquired businesses and are amortised over their estimated 
useful economic lives, which do not exceed ten years.
Management believes that goodwill represents value to the group for which the recognition of a discrete intangible asset is not permitted.  Care UK Plc Annual report and accounts 2008 64
Notes to the financial statements
continued
10.	 Intangible 	 assets 	 continued
(a) Acquired intangible assets continued
The goodwill arising on the PHG acquisition completed during the year is primarily attributable to:
A  the assessment by the directors that the enlarged Health Care division will obtain future economic benefits from its participation in the emerging 
market for the provision of healthcare services to NHS patients, beyond the currently extant customer relationships and contracts within the 
PHG business;
A  other potential future economic benefits, such as additional revenues and buyer specific operating synergies, that it is anticipated may be derived 
from the business; 
A  the fair value of the workforce in place at the date of acquisition; and
A  the initial recognition of deferred taxation.
PHG’s existing customer relationships and contracts, which are all due to expire by 2015, have been recognised as a separate intangible asset 
as required under IFRS 3 “Business Combinations”. 
The goodwill arising on other acquisitions completed during the year is primarily attributable to the fair value of the workforce in place at the date 
of acquisition and the initial recognition of deferred taxation.
The recognition of intangible assets in respect of other acquisitions in the year relates to existing customer relationships and contracts within 
the acquired businesses.
The adjustments in respect of acquisitions made in prior years relate to:
A  2008: the fair values related to the Mercury Health acquisition on 20 April 2007 were provisional due to the scale and complexity of the transaction. 
The fair values have now been finalised and the following adjustments made:
 A  fixed assets of £2.4m have been written off to give a revised fair value of £50.7m;
 A  accruals, including excess operating costs arising from the normalisation of patient waiting lists, were increased by £1.8m to £20.8m;
 A  the deferred tax provision was reduced by £0.8m in relation to the above revisions and the alignment with submitted tax computations;
 A  contingent consideration was increased by £1.1m to give revised total consideration of £32.8m; and
 A  goodwill increased by £4.5m as a consequence of the above adjustments.
With the exception of the contingent consideration adjustment, the above adjustments have been effected by way of a prior year adjustment as 
required by IFRS 3.
A  2007: £1.6m relates to the contingent consideration payable more than twelve months after the date of acquisition.
(b) Impairment charge
During the year ended 30 September 2008, the group reviewed all cash‑generating units that contain goodwill for impairment in accordance 
with IFRS 3. The recoverable amount was determined by value‑in‑use. The discount rate used in the 2008 value‑in‑use calculation was 7.23% 
(2007: 7.49%). 
A goodwill impairment charge of £13.9m (2007: £nil) was recognised following an impairment review of the goodwill arising on acquisition 
of Mercury Health. The charge arose as a consequence of the termination of the West Midlands diagnostics contract. Care UK Plc Annual report and accounts 2008 65
10.	 Intangible 	 assets 	 continued
(c) Impairment tests for cash‑generating units containing goodwill
The following divisions have significant cash‑generating units that have the following goodwill carrying values:
        2008 2007 
        £m £m
Community Care       19.1 17.2
Specialist Care       23.1 23.1
Health Care       19.1 24.9
        61.3 65.2
All of the recoverable amounts are measured based on value‑in‑use. Those calculations use cash flow projections based on actual operating results 
and the budget and forecast business plan for the three years ending 30 September 2011. A further two years of projected cash flows are incorporated 
using an estimated annual growth rate and a terminal value is placed on the value of the annual cash flows. No adjustment is made for the projected 
terminal value of the net assets of the individual cash‑generating unit.
The growth rate is consistent with the long‑term average growth rate for the industry. A pre‑tax discount rate of 7.23% (2007: 7.49%) has been 
used in discounting the projected cash flows, representing the group’s estimated weighted average cost of capital.
Community Care
The key assumptions in the value‑in‑use calculations are that forecast numbers of chargeable hours are met and hence that revenue and Earnings 
Before Interest, Tax, Depreciation and Amortisation (“EBITDA”) projections are achieved. It is assumed that EBITDA will increase by 3.0% per annum 
in years four and five of the projected cash flows. Thereafter no growth rate has been assumed. Cash flows for years one to three are derived from 
the current budget and forecast business plan.
Specialist Care
The key assumptions in the value‑in‑use calculations are that forecast occupancy levels are met and that revenue and EBITDA projections are achieved. 
It is assumed that EBITDA will increase by 2.5% per annum in years four and five of the projected cash flows. Thereafter no growth rate has been 
assumed. Cash flows for years one to three are derived from the current forecast budget and business plan.
Health Care
The key assumptions in the value‑in‑use calculations are that forecast volumes of activity/patients treated are achieved and hence that forecast 
revenue and EBITDA projections are realised. Cash flows for years one to five are derived from the current forecast budget and business plan.
Assumptions
Whilst management is confident that its assumptions are appropriate in light of circumstances at the time of the review, it is possible that 
circumstances may change. The recoverable amounts calculated on the above basis significantly exceed the carrying values of the cash‑generating 
units that include goodwill to the extent that the assumptions made would need to change by a significant amount to eliminate the surplus. Care UK Plc Annual report and accounts 2008 66

The fair values relating to the acquisition of Mercury Health were provisional in 2007 due to the scale and complexity of the transaction. In accordance 
with IFRS 3 the review of the fair value of assets and liabilities was completed before the first anniversary of the acquisition of Mercury Health, 
on 20 April 2008.
The net profit (after attributable financial expenses and taxation) since their respective dates of acquisition, for the entities acquired during the 2008 
financial year was:

  With regard to Health Care, the integration of the Mercury Health business into Care UK means it is not possible to identify the separable contribution to operating 
profit from the former Mercury business for the post‑acquisition period. Mercury’s revenue contribution in the post‑acquisition period was £24.1m. The overall 
operating profit generated by the combined Health Care business, excluding PHG, was £1.4m in the second half of the 2007 financial year. Care UK Plc Annual report and accounts 2008 69

The group’s exposure to credit risk from its trading operations is minimal given Local Authorities, PCTs and other NHS Trusts form the majority 
of its customer base.
The group has £12.7m trade and other receivables (2007: £12.7m) that are past due but not impaired. These relate primarily to Local Authorities, 
PCTs and other NHS Trusts for whom there is no history of default. These have not been provided for as there has not been a significant change in the 
credit quality and the amounts are still considered recoverable. The group does not hold any collateral over these balances. The ageing analysis of these 
receivables is as follows:

particular customers.
Concentrations of credit risk with respect to trade and current other receivables are limited due to the nature of the group’s customer base.

19.	 Deferred 	 tax 	 liabilities
Deferred tax is calculated in full on temporary differences under the liability method using a tax rate of 28% (2007: 28%).
(a) Recognised deferred tax liabilities
Deferred tax assets have been recognised in respect of tax losses and other deductible temporary differences where it is probable that these assets 
will be recovered.
The movements in deferred tax assets and liabilities (prior to the offsetting of balances within the same jurisdiction as permitted by IAS12) during 
the period are shown below. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are only offset where there is a legally enforceable right of offset and there is an intention 
to settle the balances net.

In accordance with Section 230(4) of the Companies Act 1985, the company has elected not to present its own profit and loss account. 
The profit for the year dealt with in the company’s own profit and loss account is £2.7m (2007: £13.7m).

During the year a total of 31,112 ordinary shares of 10p each were allotted as a result of the exercise of options by employees: 16,000 by the 
exercise of the Performance Related Share Option Scheme and 15,112 by the exercise of SAYE scheme options. The proceeds received as a result 
of the above exercise of options amounted to £0.08m.
On 1 August 2008, as part of the consideration for the acquisition of the remaining 50% of PHG, Investec Securities Limited undertook a “vendor 
placing” on behalf of Life Healthcare Group (Pty) Limited of 4,666,666 shares at £3.45 per share generating proceeds of £16.1m before expenses. 
Proceeds of £14.2m were paid to Life Healthcare Group (Pty) Limited with the balance, less expenses, being received by the group. The fair value 
of the shares issued was based on the published share price on 1 August 2008.
As at 30 September 2008, the group held 519,140 (2007: 532,617) of the company’s shares. These shares are held by an employee benefit trust 
to satisfy share option obligations.
(b) Dividends
After the balance sheet date the following dividend was proposed by the directors. The dividend has not been provided for:

21.	 Share‑based 	 payments
(a) Share‑based payment schemes
The group has the following share‑based payment schemes:
(i) Number 2 Executive Scheme
The Number 2 Executive Scheme was initially an unapproved scheme. It was subsequently approved by HM Customs & Revenue, although unapproved 
options were also granted under the scheme. This scheme was discontinued in 2003 in relation to new awards.
Options were granted with a fixed exercise price being not less than the market price of the shares under option on the date of grant. The options 
granted under this scheme are generally exercisable between the third and tenth anniversaries of the date of grant. An employee generally has six 
months after leaving employment of the group to exercise any unlapsed options that have vested.
For the majority of options outstanding as at the year end the following performance conditions apply. The options granted are exercisable in three 
equal tranches, subject to the achievement of performance conditions, measured over a three year period with the final tranche ending in the fifth 
year following the year of initial grant. The performance conditions for each tranche require that earnings per share for the previous three years 
must not be less than those for the base year increased by RPI +5% with yearly rests. All of the outstanding options have now fully vested. 
(ii) SAYE Scheme
Options are granted with a fixed exercise price. The exercise price is based on the average of middle market quotations of the shares under option 
for three days preceding the grant date less a discount of up to 20%. The options granted under this scheme generally become exercisable on the 
third anniversary of the commencement of the related savings contract. All employees who work more than 15 hours per week for any group company 
are eligible to participate in this scheme. The company anticipates making annual awards under this scheme. An employee generally has six months 
after leaving employment of the group to exercise any unlapsed options that have vested.

(a) Share‑based payment schemes continued
(iii) Performance Related Share Option Scheme
None of the Performance Related Share Option Scheme options is accounted for under IFRS 2 as they were granted before 7 November 2002.
All of these options initially become exercisable in three equal tranches in the three years to five years following grant. They may then be exercised 
up to seven years from the date of grant. The performance targets for each tranche normally require that earnings per share for the previous three 
years must not be less than those for the base year increased by RPI +5% with yearly rests.
(iv) Long Term Incentive Plan (“LTIP”)
Options have been granted as nil cost options under this scheme. The options granted under this scheme are generally exercisable at the end of 
the performance period and for six months thereafter. Awards under this scheme are reserved for employees at senior management level and above. 
If an employee leaves the employment of the group, a proportion of their award may be deemed to have vested, subject to satisfying any performance 
conditions and at the discretion of the Remuneration Committee. The company anticipate making annual awards under this scheme.
Awards under the LTIP scheme are subject to two performance criteria, the scales relating to which will be determined annually by the 
Remuneration Committee. Details of the performance criteria are further discussed in the directors’ remuneration report on pages 37 to 42.
(v) Employee Share Option Scheme
The options were granted with a fixed exercise price being not less than the market price of the shares under option on the date of grant. The options 
granted will lapse on the third anniversary of the date of grant if the performance conditions have not been met. For the whole of the option to be 
capable of exercise the growth in the EPS of the company over the performance period must equal or exceed the growth in RPI by 12% per annum. 
If the growth in the EPS of the company over the performance period does not equal or exceed the growth in RPI by 12% per annum then the 
option will not be exercisable.
Awards under this scheme are available for all employees and directors with participation being at the discretion of the Remuneration Committee. 
If an employee leaves the employment of the group, a proportion of their award may be deemed to have vested, subject to satisfying any performance 
conditions and at the discretion of the Remuneration Committee. 
(b) Share‑based payment expense
In accordance with the transitional provisions of IFRS 1 “First Time Adoption of IFRS”, the group has elected only to apply IFRS 2 “Share‑based 
Payment” to all relevant share‑based payment transactions granted after 7 November 2002 but not fully vested or exercised by 30 September 2004.
All share‑based payment transactions have been valued using the Black‑Scholes option‑pricing model. No performance conditions were included in 
the fair value of the calculations. The expected volatility is based on historical volatility over the year preceding the date of grant. The calculation of 
volatility uses a statistical methodology called generalised autoregressive conditional heteroscedasticity that incorporates the occurrence of volatility 
clustering. The expected life of the option is the average expected period to exercise. The risk free rate of return is the yield on zero‑coupon UK 
Government bonds of a term consistent with the assumed option life.
The total income statement expense for the year relating to employee equity‑settled share‑based plans was £0.4m (2007: £0.6m). After deferred 
tax, the total charge was £0.2m (2007: £0.5m).  Care UK Plc Annual report and accounts 2008 79

22. Financial risk management
The group’s activities and debt financing expose it to a variety of financial risks, the most significant of which are market risk (cash flow interest 
rate risk), credit risk and liquidity risk (changes in the debt market). The group’s overall risk management programme focuses on the unpredictability 
of financial markets and seeks to minimise potential adverse effects on the group’s financial performance. The group uses derivative financial instruments 
to hedge certain risk exposures, primarily instruments to fix interest rates.
It is, and has been throughout the year, the group’s policy that no trading of a speculative nature in financial instruments shall be undertaken.
Financial risk management policies are approved by the board of directors and implemented by the Finance Director who receives regular reports 
from all operating divisions to enable prompt identification of financial risks so that appropriate actions may be taken. A group treasury objectives, 
strategy and policies paper sets out specific guidelines to manage interest rate and liquidity risk and the use of financial instruments to mitigate 
these risks. Care UK Plc Annual report and accounts 2008 81
22. Financial risk management continued
(a) Market risk
(i) Cash flow interest rate risk
The group has significant short‑term deposits; therefore the group’s income and cash flows are affected by changes in market interest rates. 
Short‑term deposits are placed with financial institutions in accordance with the group’s treasury policy. Interest rates obtained on deposits 
are variable and linked to the inter‑bank rate (“LIBOR”). At present the group does not hold any fixed interest rate deposits.
The group has significant long‑term borrowings. Borrowings issued at a variable rate expose the group to further cash flow interest rate risk. 
The group uses interest rate swaps and collars to manage its exposure to floating rates. Floating rate liabilities bear interest rates based upon LIBOR. 
The interest rate swaps that the group is party to are all “pay fixed rate, receive floating rate” instruments. The interest rate collars utilised by the 
group limit its exposure to variability in LIBOR by establishing a cap and floor by which the interest rate will fluctuate.
In managing interest rate risks the group aims to reduce the impact of short‑term fluctuations in the group’s earnings. Over the longer‑term, 
however, changes in interest rates would have an impact on consolidated earnings.
The group has £201.9m of bank borrowings outstanding at the year end, of which £192.4m (95%) is hedged through the use of interest rate 
swaps and collars. £131.4m is covered by fixed interest swap arrangements, thereby eliminating the group’s exposure to movements in interest 
rates, and £61.0m is covered by cap and collar arrangements, thereby limiting the exposure to increases in interest rates. At 30 September 2008, 
a 100 bps general increase in LIBOR would increase the group’s interest charge on its borrowings by £0.2m and a 100 bps general decrease 
in LIBOR would decrease the interest charge by £0.6m. The fair value of the group’s derivative financial instruments will increase or decrease 
as a result of movements in LIBOR. The group accounts for movements in the fair value of derivative financial instruments through equity.
Short‑term deposits are placed at a rate linked to LIBOR and are consequently sensitive to movements in the inter‑bank lending rate.
(ii) Price risk
The group is not exposed to commodity price risk but as a provider of services is subject to both general and industry specific wage pressures, 
including legislative changes concerning the minimum wage level. Contracts with Local Authorities, PCTs and other NHS Trusts are also subject 
to annual price review.
A 1% general increase in salary costs would decrease profit after tax for the year ended 30 September 2008 by £1.7m. 
In common with the majority of Government funded providers, most of the group’s price changes take effect annually on 1 April. Around 40% 
of the group’s revenue is linked to general inflation indices. Refer to page 30 of the report of the directors for a further discussion of this risk.
(iii) Foreign exchange risk
The group has a minimal level of foreign currency transactions; therefore no forward foreign exchange contracts are entered into. Care UK Plc Annual report and accounts 2008 82
Notes to the financial statements

22. Financial risk management continued
(b) Credit risk
Credit risk arises from cash and cash equivalents and deposits with banks and financial institutions. Credit exposures in respect to customers 
is limited given the majority of the group’s income is attributable to Local Authorities, Primary Care Trusts and other NHS Trusts. The group has 
no significant concentrations of credit risk. For banks and financial institutions, only parties with a minimum rating of A are accepted. 
The table below analyses the group’s cash and cash equivalents by credit exposure excluding bank balances and petty cash:

Counterparty      Rating £m £m
Financial institutions – money market deposits      AA 0.8 —
Financial institutions – money market deposits      AA‑ 5.6 —
Management does not expect any losses from non‑performance arising from counterparties used.
Refer to note 13 for information relating to an analysis of trade receivables which are past due but not impaired and trade receivables which are 
past due and impaired.
(c) Liquidity risk 
A policy of prudent liquidity risk management is applied. The group’s operational cash flow is largely stable and predictable given the contractual 
nature of the core business activity. The group prepares annual cash flow forecasts and three year cash flow budgets reflecting known commitments 
and anticipated projects. Borrowing facilities are arranged as necessary to finance requirements, including capital expenditure. Short‑term flexibility 
is achieved by the utilisation of overdraft facilities. Adequate headroom in available facilities is maintained.
The group’s core funding is represented by a secured long‑term loan facility (see note 16 for further details). At the time of signing these financial 
statements, the group has available bank and overdraft facilities totalling £273.7m, which is sufficient, together with cash flow from profits, 
to fund present commitments. Interest is charged on the term facilities at a margin over LIBOR as explained in part (a) to this note. Interest arising 
on the group’s overdraft facility is calculated after netting positive cash balances held. Interest on this facility is charged at base rate plus a margin.
A maturity profile of the principal obligations with respect to the group’s financial liabilities is provided in note 16(c). Furthermore the group has 
contractual obligations with respect to interest due on the principal sums borrowed. £131.4m (65%) is covered by fixed interest swap arrangements 
which have a weighted average remaining life of 3.21 years and a weighted contract rate of 5.09% payable quarterly. £61.0m (30%) is covered by 
effective cap arrangements which have a weighted remaining life of 3.67 years and a weighted contract cap of 5.82% payable quarterly. The remaining 
£9.5m attracts interest at a fluctuating rate linked to LIBOR and is settled quarterly. The maturity profile of the principal and finance charge obligations 
with respect to finance leases is disclosed in note 16(d).
(d) Capital risk management
The board monitors a range of financial metrics including return on capital employed and gearing to measure the efficiency of the group’s capital 
structure and the returns for shareholders. Capital comprises shareholders’ equity and debt facilities.
The board has a policy to maintain the earnings cover for dividends at a level appropriate to the group’s growth objectives.
From time to time the company purchases its own shares in the market for the purpose of issuing shares under the group’s LTIP programmes. 
Outside of this practice the group does not have a defined share buy‑back plan. Care UK Plc Annual report and accounts 2008 83

and are therefore not included in the above disclosures:
A  2008 and 2007: £30.0m 5.5 year fixed interest swap at 4.9525% LIBOR commencing 16 August 2009 and expiring on 15 February 2015 
which reduces by £5.0m annually each August from 2010 through to 2014.
The interest rate swaps and collars have been accounted for as hedge transactions, hence changes in fair value have been recognised directly 
in the hedging reserves.  Care UK Plc Annual report and accounts 2008 84

(b) Embedded derivatives
In accordance with IAS 39 “Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement”, the group has reviewed all contracts for embedded derivatives 
that are required to be separately accounted for if they do not meet certain requirements set out in the standard. No such derivatives were identified 
as a result of the review.

The following summarises the major methods and assumptions used in estimating the fair values of the financial instruments reflected in the above tables:
Derivatives
Derivative financial instruments are valued by using broker quotes.
Trade and other receivables/payables
For receivables/payables with a remaining life of less than one year, the notional amount is deemed to reflect the fair value. All other receivables/payables 
are discounted to determine the fair value.
Interest‑bearing loans and borrowings
Fair value is calculated based on discounted expected future principal and interest cash flows. Care UK Plc Annual report and accounts 2008 85
23. Financial instruments continued
(d) Fair value of financial assets and liabilities continued
Finance lease liabilities
The fair value is estimated as the present value of future cash flows, discounted at market interest rates for homogenous lease agreements. 
The estimated fair values reflect changes in the interest rates.
Interest rates for determining fair value
Unless specified above, the group uses the Government yield curve as of 30 September 2008 plus an adequate constant spread to discount 
financial instruments. The interest rates used are as follows:
        2008 2007
Loans and borrowings       9.38% 7.0%
Leases       13.9% 13.9%
Receivables       9.38% 6.5%
24. Pensions
The group has established a number of pension schemes, both defined contribution and defined benefit, covering a number of its employees.
(a) Defined contribution plan
The group has a defined contribution group personal pension plan. Contributions to this scheme are charged to the income statement as they fall due. 
The assets of this scheme are held separately from those of the group in independently administered funds. 
Pension costs for defined contribution schemes are as follows:
        2008 2007 
        £m £m
Defined contribution schemes       0.8 0.7
As at 30 September 2008 contributions amounting to £nil (2007: £0.1m) were payable to the scheme and are included in creditors.
(b) Defined benefit plans
As a result of contractual arrangements with a small number of public sector customers, the group contributes to three defined benefit schemes. 
These schemes provide pension benefits based on final pensionable pay.
The schemes are funded by payments to independently managed funds, the assets of which are held separately from those of the group. The funds 
are administered by trustees as a separate legal entity. The trustees of the fund are required to act in the best interest of the fund’s beneficiaries. 
The appointment of trustees is determined by the schemes’ trust documentation.
Contributions to the defined benefit pension schemes are charged to the income statement so as to spread the cost of pensions over employees’ 
estimated working lives with the group. The contributions are determined by qualified actuaries on the basis of triennial valuations using the 
projected unit method.
The liabilities of the defined benefit schemes are measured by discounting the best estimate of future cash flows to be paid out by the schemes using 
the projected unit method. This is the amount, after taking into consideration reimbursement assets, which is reflected in the deficit in the balance 
sheet. The projected unit method is an accrued benefits valuation method in which the scheme liabilities make allowance for projected earnings.
Care UK LG Pension Scheme
The most recent valuation was as at 1 April 2006. At the date of the actuarial valuation the market value of the scheme’s assets was £2.5m and 
the actuarial value of those assets represented 80% of the benefits that had accrued to members, after allowing for expected future increases in 
earnings. Following the valuation the employer contribution rate decreased with effect from 1 October 2007 from 29.45% to 29.40%. The group 
will monitor funding levels on an annual basis. The next triennial valuation is due to be completed as at 1 April 2009. The group considers that 
the contribution rates agreed with the trustees at the last valuation date are sufficient to eliminate the deficit over ten years and that regular 
contributions which are based on service costs will not increase significantly.
Employer contributions amounted to £0.8m (2007: £0.8m) for the year ended 30 September 2008. Employer contribution rates in respect of future 
years have currently been agreed at 29.40% of total pensionable salaries.
This scheme obtains approval by the Government Actuarial Department when new members join the scheme.
The trustee’s board has five places, three of which are nominated by the employer and two are nominated by the scheme members. Care UK Plc Annual report and accounts 2008 86

(b) Defined benefit plans continued
Dorset County Council Pension Fund
The group is an admitted body of the Dorset County Council Local Government Pension Scheme. This is a closed scheme and no new members 
can be admitted. During the year ended 30 September 2006 a number of employees transferred to the group but continued to be members 
of Dorset County Council Pension Fund.
Under the rules of the admission agreement, the associated pension fund assets and liabilities are separately identifiable and segregated for 
funding purposes.
Under the terms of the group’s contract with Poole Borough Council, the group is indemnified for any shortfall in scheme assets and for any increase 
in contributions required by any future actuarial valuation; hence the group has no constructive or legal obligation to fund a deficit on the associated 
segregated portion of the scheme. Accordingly, the group has recognised an asset equal to the current deficit on the segregated portion of the 
scheme. This reimbursement asset has been presented as offsetting the current scheme deficit on the segregated portion of the scheme and 
is therefore included within retirement benefit obligations.
The most recent valuation of this scheme was as at 31 March 2007. As at the date of the latest actuarial valuation, the segregated portion of the 
scheme showed that the value of the scheme’s assets was £1.2m and that the actuarial value of those assets represented 82% of the benefits that 
had accrued to members, after allowing for expected future increases in earnings.
Employer contributions amounted to £0.1m (2007: £0.1m) for the year to 30 September 2008. Contribution rates in respect of next year are expected 
to be 13.3% of total pensionable salary.
London Borough of Harrow Pension Scheme
The group is an admitted body of the London Borough of Harrow Pension Scheme. This is a closed scheme and no new members can be admitted. 
During the year ended 30 September 2008 a number of employees transferred to the group but continued to be members of London Borough 
of Harrow Pension Fund.
Under the rules of the admission agreement, the associated pension fund assets and liabilities are separately identifiable and segregated for 
funding purposes.
Under the terms of the group’s contract with the London Borough of Harrow, the group has no constructive or legal obligation to fund a deficit 
on the associated segregated portion of the scheme. Accordingly, the group has accounted for the scheme as a defined contribution scheme.
Employer contributions amounted to £0.1m (2007: £nil) for the year to 30 September 2008. Contribution rates in respect of next year are expected 
to be 19.5% of total pensionable salary.
The principal assumptions made by the actuaries were:
        2008 2007 
        % %
Rate of increase of pensionable salaries       4.7–4.8 4.4–4.5
Rate of increase in pensions in payment and deferred pensions      3.6–3.7 3.4–3.5
Discount rate       6.9–7.0 5.9–6.0
Inflation assumptions       3.6–3.7 3.4–3.5 
Expected return on plan assets       4.5–8.0 5.5–6.9
The derivation of the overall expected return on assets reflects the actual asset allocation at the measurement date combined with an expected 
return for each asset class. The bond return is based on the prevailing return available on high quality (AA or similar) corporate bonds. The returns 
on equities and property are based on a number of factors including the income yield at the measurement date, the long‑term growth prospects 
for the economy in general, the long‑term relationship between each asset class and the bond returns and the movement in market indices since 
the previous measurement date. The actual loss on plan assets was £0.2m (2007: £0.5m gain). Care UK Plc Annual report and accounts 2008 87

27.	 Contingent 	 liabilities
The group has a number of Government grants that would have to be repaid if the related property were to be sold. As at 30 September 2008 
the amount that may be repayable is £0.2m (2007: £0.2m). 
The group also has a number of cross guarantees between group companies relating to debtor balances. The directors consider that the likelihood 
of these guarantees being called upon is remote.
28. Related party transactions
(a) Identity of related parties
The group has a related party relationship with its subsidiaries, joint venture (until 31 July 2008) and with its directors and executive officers.
(b) Pension plans
During the year, the group made various payments to defined benefit pension plans. Details of these transactions are set out in note 24 to the 
financial statements.
(c) Joint venture
During the year ended 30 September 2008 £0.2m (2007: £0.7m) of services were provided and £0.5m (2007: £1.0m) of interest charged to PHG 
by Care UK Plc during the period it was a joint venture of the group. At 30 September 2007, the group was owed £6.0m by PHG and the company 
was owed £5.9m (2007: £5.9m). Transactions with the joint venture were priced on an arm’s length basis. Loans and interest receivable from the 
joint venture are included in notes 11 and 13 respectively. No dividends were received from the joint venture in 2008 or in 2007. There were no 
provisions or expenses recognised for doubtful debts with the joint venture. The group received £5.9m of loan repayments from PHG during 
the year.
(d) Subsidiaries
The group centrally manages its financing arrangements. Amounts are transferred within the group, dependent on the operational needs of individual 
companies. The directors do not consider it meaningful to set out the gross amounts of transfers between individual companies. Similarly the directors 
do not consider it meaningful to set out the interest and dividend payments made within the group as these are a function of the group’s central 
financing arrangements. There are no provisions or expenses recognised for doubtful debts with subsidiary undertakings.
Details of the company’s cash and indebtedness are set out in notes 14 and 16 and amounts due or owed to subsidiary undertakings are set 
out in notes 13 and 17.

Independent auditor’s report
to the members of Care UK Plc
We have audited the group and parent company financial statements (“the financial statements”) of Care UK Plc for the year ended 30 September 2008 
which comprise the group income statement, the group and parent company balance sheets, the group and parent company cash flow statements, the 
group and parent company statement of recognised income and expenses, and the related notes. These financial statements have been prepared under the 
accounting policies set out therein. We have also audited the information in the directors’ remuneration report that is described as having been audited.
This report is made solely to the company’s members, as a body, in accordance with Section 235 of the Companies Act 1985. Our audit work 
has been undertaken so that we might state to the company’s members those matters we are required to state to them in an auditor’s report 
and for no other purpose. To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility to anyone other than the company 
and the company’s members as a body, for our audit work, for this report, or for the opinions we have formed.

The directors’ responsibilities for preparing the annual report, the directors’ remuneration report and the financial statements in accordance with applicable 
law and International Financial Reporting Standards (“IFRSs”) as adopted by the EU are set out in the statement of directors’ responsibilities on page 43. 
Our responsibility is to audit the financial statements and the part of the directors’ remuneration report to be audited in accordance with relevant 
legal and regulatory requirements and International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland). 
We report to you our opinion as to whether the financial statements give a true and fair view and whether the financial statements and the part of 
the directors’ remuneration report to be audited have been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 1985 and, as regards the group 
financial statements, Article 4 of the IAS Regulation. We also report to you whether in our opinion the information given in the directors’ report is 
consistent with the financial statements. The information given in the directors’ report includes that specific information presented in the Chairman’s 
statement, Chief Executive’s report and financial review that is cross referred from the results and dividends section of the report of the directors.
In addition we report to you if, in our opinion, the company has not kept proper accounting records, if we have not received all the information 
and explanations we require for our audit, or if information specified by law regarding directors’ remuneration and other transactions is not disclosed. 
We review whether the corporate governance statement reflects the company’s compliance with the nine provisions of the 2003 Combined Code specified 
for our review by the Listing Rules of the Financial Services Authority, and we report if it does not. We are not required to consider whether the board’s 
statements on internal control cover all risks and controls, or form an opinion on the effectiveness of the group’s corporate governance procedures or 
its risk and control procedures. 
We read the other information contained in the annual report and consider whether it is consistent with the audited financial statements. We consider the 
implications for our report if we become aware of any apparent misstatements or material inconsistencies with the financial statements. Our responsibilities 
do not extend to any other information. 
Audit opinion 
We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland) issued by the Auditing Practices Board. An audit includes 
examination, on a test basis, of evidence relevant to the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements and the part of the directors’ remuneration report 
to be audited. It also includes an assessment of the significant estimates and judgements made by the directors in the preparation of the financial statements, 
and of whether the accounting policies are appropriate to the group’s and company’s circumstances, consistently applied and adequately disclosed. 
We planned and performed our audit so as to obtain all the information and explanations which we considered necessary in order to provide us 
with sufficient evidence to give reasonable assurance that the financial statements and the part of the directors’ remuneration report to be audited 
are free from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or other irregularity or error. In forming our opinion we also evaluated the overall 
adequacy of the presentation of information in the financial statements and the part of the directors’ remuneration report to be audited.
Opinion
In our opinion:
A  the group financial statements give a true and fair view, in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the EU, of the state of the group’s affairs 
as at 30 September 2008 and of its loss for the year then ended; 
A  the parent company financial statements give a true and fair view, in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the EU as applied in accordance 
with the provisions of the Companies Act 1985, of the state of the parent company’s affairs as at 30 September 2008;

V oting 	 and 	 proxies
1.  All holders of ordinary shares of 10p each in the company on the Register at 6.00pm on 9 February 2009 are entitled to attend and speak at the 
meeting. A holder of ordinary shares of 10p each is entitled to appoint one or more proxies to attend and, on a poll, vote in his stead. A shareholder 
may appoint more than one proxy in relation to the meeting provided that each proxy is appointed to exercise rights attached to a different share 
or shares held by him or her. A proxy need not be a member of the company.
2. Completion of the form of proxy will not prevent a holder of ordinary shares of 10p each from attending the meeting and voting in person. 
3.  The form of proxy to be valid must be lodged together with the power of attorney or other authority (if any) under which it is signed, or a notarially 
certified copy of such power of attorney or other authority, at Computershare Investor Services Plc, PO Box 1075, The Pavillions, Bridgwater Road, 
Bristol BS99 3FA, not later than 48 hours before the time of the meeting or adjourned meeting.
4. In the case of an individual, the form of proxy must be signed by the appointor or by his/her attorney duly authorised in writing.
5.  In the case of a corporation, the form of proxy must either be executed under its common seal or under the hand of a duly authorised officer or attorney.
6.  In the case of a joint holder, the vote of the first named holder on the register of members (whether voting in person or by proxy) will be accepted 
to the exclusion of the votes of the other joint holder(s) in respect of the joint holding. 
7. Any alteration in the form of proxy must be initialled. 
8.  As at 15 December 2008 (being the last practicable business day prior to the publication of the notice) the company’s issued share capital consists 
of 61,549,098 ordinary shares. The shares held by the EBT do not attract voting rights, therefore the total voting rights in the company as at 
15 December 2008 are 61,029,958. 
9.  As an alternative to completing and returning the printed form of proxy, you may submit your proxy over the internet by accessing the Company’s 
website www.eproxyappointment.com. For security purposes, shareholders will need to provide their shareholder reference number (“SRN”) 
and personal identification number (“PIN”) to validate the submission of their proxy online. Shareholders’ individual SRN and PIN are shown 
on the printed form of proxy sent to them. For further information, see the instructions printed on the form of proxy. Care UK Plc Annual report and accounts 2008 95
V oting 	 and 	 proxies 	 continued
10.  A person to whom this notice is sent who is a person nominated under Section 146 of the Companies Act 2006 to enjoy information rights 
(a “Nominated Person”) may, under an agreement between him/her and the shareholder by whom he/she was nominated, have a right to be 
appointed (or to have someone else appointed) as a proxy for the meeting. If a Nominated Person has no such proxy appointment right or does 
not wish to exercise it, he/she may, under any such agreement, have a right to give instructions to the shareholder as to the exercise of voting rights. 
The statements of the rights of shareholders in relation to the appointment of proxies set out above do not apply to a Nominated Person.
11.  CREST members who wish to appoint a proxy or proxies by utilising the CREST electronic proxy appointment service may do so for the meeting 
and any adjournment(s) thereof by utilising the procedures described in the CREST manual. CREST personal members or other CREST sponsored 
members and those CREST members who have appointed voting service provider(s), should refer to their CREST sponsor or voting service 
provider(s), who will be able to take the appropriate action on their behalf.
12.  In order to facilitate voting by corporate representatives at the meeting, arrangements will be put in place at the meeting so that (a) if a 
corporate shareholder has appointed the chairman of the meeting as its corporate representative to vote on a poll in accordance with the 
directions of all the other corporate representatives for that shareholder at the meeting, then on a poll those corporate representatives will give 
voting directions to the chairman and the chairman will vote (or withhold a vote) as corporate representative in accordance with those directions; 
and (b) if more than one corporate representative for the same corporate share owner attends the meeting but the corporate shareholder has not 
appointed the chairman of the meeting as its corporate representative, a designated corporate representative will be nominated, from those corporate 
representatives who attend, who will vote on a poll and the other corporate representatives will give voting directions to that designated corporate 
representative. Corporate shareholders are referred to the guidance issued by the Institute of Chartered Secretaries and Administrators on proxies 
and corporate representatives (www.icsa.org.uk) for further details of this procedure. The guidance includes a sample form of appointment 
letter if the chairman is being appointed as described in (a) above.

Explanatory 	 note 	 regarding 	 the 	 special 	 business
1.  Resolution 7 seeks to increase the authorised share capital to £10,000,000 by the creation of a further 30,000,000 ordinary shares of 10p each 
to rank pari passu with the existing ordinary shares.
2.  At the annual general meeting of the company held on 6 February 2008, the directors were authorised for the purposes of Section 80 of the 
Companies Act 1985 to allot relevant securities up to an aggregate nominal value of £1,895,044. That authority will expire at the conclusion of 
the forthcoming annual general meeting. At this year’s annual general meeting, an Ordinary Resolution (Resolution 8) will be proposed to grant 
the directors authority under Section 80 of the Companies Act 1985 to allot relevant securities up to the maximum aggregate nominal amount of 
£2,051,616 representing one third of the total share capital of the company in issue as at 15 December, 2008 being the last practicable business day 
prior to the publication of the notice, or in the event of Resolution 7 not being passed up to the maximum aggregate nominal amount of £845,090 
being the balance of authorised unissued share capital. The directors have no present intention of exercising that authority. The authority to allot up 
to £2,051,616 or as the case may be £845,090 nominal aggregate value of relevant securities to be conferred pursuant to Resolution 8 will lapse on 
30 April 2010 or on the conclusion of the next annual general meeting of the company after the passing of such resolution, whichever is the earlier.
3.  At the annual general meeting of the company held on 6 February 2008, the directors were empowered for the purposes of Section 95 of the 
Companies Act 1985 to allot equity securities which are to be paid up in cash as if Section 89(1) of the Companies Act 1985 did not apply to any 
such allotment for the purposes, inter alia, of the allotment of equity securities for cash up to an aggregate nominal value of £284,257 otherwise 
than by way of rights. That authority will expire at the conclusion of the forthcoming annual general meeting. At this year’s annual general meeting, 
a Special Resolution (Resolution 9) will be proposed to empower the directors to allot equity securities for cash pursuant to the authority conferred 
upon them by Resolution 9 as if Section 89(1) of the Companies Act 1985 did not apply to any such allotment provided that such power will be 
limited to the allotment of equity securities in connection with rights issues (as described in Resolution 10) and the allotment of equity securities 
up to an aggregate nominal value of £307,745 representing approximately 5% of the total ordinary share capital in issue in the company as at 
15 December 2008 being the last practicable business day prior to the publication of the notice. The authority will terminate no later than 
15 months after the passing of the Special Resolution.
4.  Resolution 10 authorises the company generally to make purchases of its own shares, as permitted by the Companies Act 1985, the Companies Act 2006 
and the UK Listing Authority. The directors will only exercise this power of purchase in circumstances which, in the opinion of the directors should result 
in an improvement in earnings per share for the remaining shareholders and all such purchases will be made through the London Stock Exchange. Care UK Plc Annual report and accounts 2008 96

  The results shown in the table have not been restated under adopted IFRS. The principal adjustments that would be required to restate the UK GAAP results to adopted 
IFRS would be: the cessation of goodwill amortisation and provision of intangible asset amortisation; inclusion of the pension deficit; additional equity‑settled share‑based 
payments expense; the joint venture presentational adjustment which presents joint venture taxation and interest within operating profit; and the cessation of accruing 
for proposed dividends.
**
  Adjusted operating profit is adjusted for integration and restructuring costs (2007), profit on Richmond property disposal (2006), amortisation of intangible assets 
(2008, 2007, 2006, 2005), impairment of goodwill and intangible assets (2008, 2006), joint venture net financing costs and taxation (2008, 2007, 2006, 2005), 
and amortisation of goodwill (2004). Basic adjusted earnings per share are also adjusted for the post taxation effects of these items.

Worldpay Group plc
Annual Report and Accounts 2015
Dear shareholder,
In 2015, we delivered strong financial 
performance, demonstrating that we have 
a robust business model that is capable 
of delivering strong, visible and recurring 
shareholder returns. In support of our 
strategic vision, we have invested in our 
people, products and technology. We 
are currently entering the final stages 
of building our market-leading new 
technology platform and have a strong 
pipeline of technical innovation to help 
our customers prosper. 
In addition to the successful IPO towards 
the end of 2015, for which we gained 
external recognition as ‘IPO of the year 
2015’ in the Broadwalk Service Awards, 
we also put in place new committed 
bank financing and issued €500m senior 
unsecured notes. We now have the 
capital structure to support our growth 
in the future.
Since my appointment as Chairman in 
September 2015, I have spent time with 
our executive team and other employees 
to gain an understanding of this industry, 
our key strengths and the challenges we 
Chairman‘s statement
In our first Annual Report and

publicly listed company in October

of significant progress, building our

face. What is clear to me is that the 
payments market is developing at pace, 
becoming increasingly complex and 
challenging; the expectations placed upon 
payments providers such as Worldpay are 
increasing; and, with our talented people, 
our focus on the customer and our 
technological innovation, we are well 
positioned to support our customers, both 
now and in the future.
The Board
We have built a strong Board with Non-
Executive Directors who possess a diverse 
range of skills and experience to 
complement those of our three Executive 
Directors. John Allen and Martin Scicluna 
served the Group as Independent Non-
Executive Directors under private equity 
ownership and they bring knowledge of the 
Company and the industry as well as 
substantial commercial and financial 
experience to our new Board’s 
deliberations. I am delighted that Deanna 
Oppenheimer joined the Board as an 
Independent Non-Executive Director on 
1 January 2016. The breadth of her skills and 
experience in financial services will be 
invaluable to Worldpay. We will further 
strengthen the Board during 2016. Advent 
and Bain remain large shareholders of the 
Group and, as entitled, have appointed 
James Brocklebank and Robin Marshall 
respectively as Non-Executive Directors 
on the Board. Each possesses a wealth 
of knowledge about the Company and 
the industry. 
Governance and corporate culture
The Board has made a firm commitment to 
high standards of corporate governance 
and this is further explained in the 
corporate governance report. We believe 
that strong governance should prevail 
throughout the organisation and we pay 
attention to the progress being made in 
building a culture that supports the 
sustainable long-term success of the 
Group.
Colleagues
On behalf of the Board, I would like to pay 
special thanks to our colleagues, who have 
made a substantial contribution to our 
achievements throughout the year. It is 
particularly pleasing to see that a 
significant majority are shareholders, 
aligning their interests with those of other 
shareholders and enabling them to share 
in the success they are helping to create.
Dividend policy
The Board intends to adopt a dividend 
policy based on a payout ratio of 20-30% of 
reported profit after tax per annum, 
commencing in the current financial year 
and we expect to announce our first 
interim dividend with our 2016 half year 
results, payable later in the year. As 
referenced in the IPO Prospectus, no 
dividend will be paid in respect of 2015. 
Our stakeholders
I would like to thank all our shareholders, 
bond holders and banks for their support 
during the IPO, bond issue and bank 
financing and look forward to their 
continued engagement and support in 
the future.

Worldpay Group plc
Annual Report and Accounts 2015
An increasingly complex and dynamic 
payments market
We delivered this strong performance 
against a backdrop of an increasingly 
complex and dynamic payments 
landscape. This is presenting significant 
challenges to our customers, from the 
smallest traders to some of the largest 
global businesses.
This growing complexity is partly being 
driven by the higher expectations of 
merchants’ own customers. For example, 
they are increasingly demanding improved 
mobile functionality as smartphone and 
tablet use continues to grow, and a unified 
view of transactions across physical, 
online and mobile channels.
At the same time, our merchants’ markets 
are becoming ever more international, 
requiring them to accept more currencies 
and payment methods than ever before. 
As a result, they also need to manage the 
associated regulation and increased risk, 
fraud and security issues. With 
increasingly global competition, 
successful merchants are also looking at 
how they can improve their use of data to 
gain deeper insight into their customers’ 
buying habits and to drive efficiency.
Worldpay is well positioned to support our 
customers in meeting these challenges. 
I am confident that we have the 
capabilities, talent and resources to be at 
the forefront of innovation and to deliver 
securely and reliably the services and 
products our customers need.
Substantial progress on the 
implementation of our strategy
Our strategy is designed to maximise 
the benefits of our strong competitive 
position in our markets, in order to 
deliver sustainable, predictable growth, 
profitability and shareholder returns. 
We aim to do this by ensuring that we 
have a deep understanding of the needs 
of our customers in core segments. We 
differentiate our offering through 
technology and innovative products, and 
aim to expand in existing markets, as well 
as enter new ones. 
Realising the full potential of our business 
model should result in strong cash flow 
generation, allowing us to reinvest in our 
business, as well as enhance our growth 
through acquisitions and investments.
In 2015, we made substantial progress on 
the implementation of our strategy, 
resulting in growth in all key customer 
segments. We deepened and 
strengthened our customer relationships, 
resulting in strong growth in Global eCom, 
with transactions up 31%; 9% transaction 
growth in the US; and transaction growth 
of 8% in the UK.
2015 was a year of strong 
operational and financial 
performance as well as 
considerable achievement in 
the further implementation 
of our strategy.  10
Worldpay Group plc
Annual Report and Accounts 2015
We also delivered new and innovative 
products, and updated existing ones, for 
our customers. We obtained processing 
licenses in Canada and Japan, while new 
customer products and services included 
an update to RiskGuardian, our fraud 
prevention tool; improved mobile-friendly 
payments through Hosted Payment Pages; 
rich data analytics for UK SMEs through My 
Business Dashboard; and delivery of an 
omnichannel offering through Worldpay 
Total. In the US, the technology integration 
of the SecureNet acquisition is progressing 
to plan, and we signed over 80 new 
partners in the year. These partners will be 
important in enabling us to deliver new, 
integrated payment products focused on 
specific customer segments in the US 
market. We aim to be at the forefront of 
innovation and in 2015 we continued to 
invest in our Pazien joint venture and filed 
three patent applications.
The UK saw the successful launch, towards 
the end of the year, of Worldpay Business 
Finance (in partnership with Liberis), with 
over £2m committed so far to UK companies 
looking to invest in and grow their 
businesses. We are also now delivering an 
ecommerce solution to more than 40% of 
new UK SME customers, against less than 
20% of existing customers.
Another key area of achievement was in the 
further strengthening of our technological 
capabilities, which are a key source of 
differentiation for us. In terms of progress 
on our new technology platform, which will 
deliver significant enhancements to our 
agility, flexibility and efficiency, we migrated 
the off-host servicing and data applications 
to our own systems, so that only one 
component now remains on RBS’ systems: 
the clearing and settlement engine. We 
have now completed the build of the core 
platform of the new system to replace this, 
and expect to start boarding our first 
customers onto it in the summer of 2016.
Strong financial performance
I am pleased to report that we delivered a 
strong financial performance, consistent 
with the guidance that we gave at the time 
of our IPO.
Across the Group, we processed over 
13 billion transactions, an increase of 
14% compared to 2014. Total transaction 
value was £401.9bn, while the net revenue 
we earned from processing these 
transactions rose by 14%, to £981.7m.
In terms of Group profitability, underlying 
EBITDA increased 8% to £406.1m, a strong 
performance. At a divisional level, Global 
eCom and WPUK outperformed against 
our expectations. Global eCom net revenue 
grew 17% compared to 2014, driven by 
both the growth of the market and new 
customer wins. In the UK, net revenue 
grew 11%, driven by improved customer 
retention, new products and increased 
penetration of ecommerce solutions.
In the US, net revenue grew 15%. Excluding 
the benefit of the SecureNet acquisition 
and currency movements, the growth was 
3%. We are making progress in 
transforming the business into one with 
an integrated customer offering, 
supported by a partner and developer-led 
business model, however, it is taking 
longer and costing more than expected. 
Floris de Kort, who previously headed our 
Global eCom division, is now leading the 
US business, and in 2016 will focus on the 
completion of this transformation and the 
normalisation of the cost base.
Our people: making Worldpay a great 
place to work
I am proud of the further progress we made 
in 2015 to improve our organisational 
effectiveness and make Worldpay a great 
place to work. The culture of the 
Worldpay Way, which encourages 
colleagues to work smart, be spirited 
and be supportive, is driving significant 
improvements in employee engagement.

a successful year for the Group. Looking

employees being Worldpay shareholders.
Outlook
The Group has made a good start to 2016, 
in line with expectations. We remain 
confident in our prospects over the 
medium term. These prospects are 
reflected in the guidance we gave at the 
time of our IPO, including targeting net 
revenue growth of approximately 9% to 
11% CAGR over the medium to long term, 
which remains unchanged.
Worldpay is an innovative payments 
technology company, and we are investing 
heavily to deliver strong, sustainable 
growth. We aim for world-class 
performance, reliability and security in 
seeking to solve payments complexity for 
our customers. With market-leading global 
reach and product coverage, a modern 
and scalable technology platform, strong 
customer propositions and a talented and 
engaged workforce, I am confident that 
we will be able to realise our vision of being 
the world’s most progressive, reliable 
payments partner, sharing insights and 
helping customers prosper.

Worldpay Group plc
Annual Report and Accounts 2015
Since the widespread adoption of payment cards 
in the 1960s, there has been an ongoing shift away 
from cash to non-cash payments. T oday, these 
include credit, debit, prepaid cards, and many 
other forms of local and alternative payment 
methods. These are accepted through a wide range 
of channels, such as at an in-store point-of-sale 
terminal, over the internet or on a mobile device.
 
In light of these developments, we believe that 
merchants will need to focus on payments more 
than ever before, with payment acceptance no 
longer seen as a business utility but as a strategic 
enabler of growth and differentiation. As such, we 
believe merchants need their payment partners, 
not only to process transactions safely and reliably, 
but also to provide them with the opportunity to 
compete across channels, open up new markets, 
interpret their transaction data and maximise 
acceptance while minimising fraud and risk.

Digital payments 
is a large, global 
and fast-growing 
market
MARKET THEME 1:
We operate in a large market that is 
growing at a fast rate. The total 
transaction value in 11 key payments 
markets that represent approximately 
75% of 2015 total global transaction value 
is estimated to be approximately £22tn
1
. 
The market is also experiencing a 
pronounced shift away from cash and 
towards card-based and local and 
alternative payment methods.
Within the total market, we believe there 
are pockets of faster growth across 
certain geographies and merchant 
verticals, as well as in local and alternative 
payment methods as follows: 
 
  Fast growth in ecommerce and mobile 
payments: ecommerce transactions 
are expected to have grown at a CAGR 
of 16% from 2010 to 2015, while mobile 
payments transactions are expected 
to have grown at a CAGR of 57% in 
the same period.
  Higher growth in emerging markets 
compared to developed markets: 
From 2010 to 2015, we expect emerging 
markets will have experienced faster 
growth in digital payments turnover 
than developed markets with some 
regions (for example, China and parts of 
Latin America) expected to see CAGRs 
well above developed countries such 
as the United States and the UK.
  Differentiation of growth, market size 
and revenue levels by type of merchant 
industry and segment and merchant 
type: Payment needs are very different 
for merchants depending on which 
vertical they operate in. Verticals with 
significant digital payment and cross-
border flows (such as Travel, Airlines, 
Digital Content and Global Retail) 
tend to grow faster than the broader 
economy. In addition, different customer 
segments tend to generate different 
levels of net revenue depending on the 
complexity of their payment needs.

Technology is liberating commerce for 
consumers, allowing them to switch between 
payment channels, browse and buy on the 
move and pay through different devices. In this 
new technological environment, merchants 
require innovative and flexible payment 
solutions in an omni-channel environment 
that are delivered with speed to market.
Consumers can now shop and transact 
using almost any kind of device, at a time 
and place of their choosing. Over 1.4 billion 
smartphones were used globally in 2014
1
. 
Almost half of these devices are connected 
with high-speed 3G or 4G internet 
connections, which has driven up the use 
of data 20-fold, while the cost of data usage 
has decreased to near-zero
2
. These trends 
are changing the nature of the internet, 
where ecommerce increasingly means 
mobile commerce, and where the emerging 
‘internet of things’ means our objects will 
shop for us and transact for goods and 
services between each other. 
However, the innovations in device and 
connectivity technologies also bring with 
them increases in threats to identity and 
other cyber crime, thereby increasing the 
need for security technology that creates 
‘secure routes’ for the free flow of funds 
and information between consumers and 
merchants, as well as effective cyber 
security and fraud detection software and 
programs. The net result of this is that 
payment partners have an opportunity to 
play an ever-more prominent role in their 
customers’ businesses to help unlock 
benefits from higher growth, increased 
cost savings and reduced risk profiles.

Worldpay Group plc
Annual Report and Accounts 2015
Consumers have demonstrated a 
willingness to engage with new 
technologies and change their traditional 
shopping habits in order to satisfy their 
desires for a seamless, but safe, 
transaction experience. Only 1% of the 
global population had a mobile phone in 
1995 compared to 73% in 2014
1
. 
Consumers are using these devices to 
make transactions across borders and  
on the move. 
As payments are embedded into everyday 
transactions, such as ‘in-app’ payments for 
taxis or within mobile games, consumers 
are increasingly making purchases from 
their smartphones, at a time and place of 
their convenience, without being 
constrained by specific types of payments 
or a merchant’s location. These new 
experiences are difficult to support using 
traditional payments technology, and 
complex to implement for merchants. 
Consumers increasingly expect to shop in 
one channel and seamlessly return an item 
in another but data, finances and 
transactions are stored in different systems 
for ecommerce and in-store channels.

There are more than 300 payment 
methods in use around the world. We 
believe the cost and complexity to 
merchants of connecting to each of these 
will increase as the number of local and 
alternative payment methods proliferate: 
  New payment methods will be the 
main way to pay: 43% of global payment 
transactions in 2012 were made using 
local and alternative payment methods, 
which is expected to increase to 59% 
by 2017
1
. The e-wallets market alone 
is expected to grow to £1.6tn in 
transaction value in the same period. 
  Alternatives to traditional payments 
will unlock new markets: Start-ups are 
exploring cross-border transactions, 
e.g. TransferWise; account-to-account 
transfers, e.g. Venmo; and digital 
versions of ‘payment on delivery’, e.g. 
Klarna. They are also creating ways for 
the under- and un-banked to connect 
to global commerce through platforms 
such as Zong and Boku.
  Local schemes are expanding globally: 
Payment schemes that have traditionally 
focused on a single region are expanding 
rapidly. For example, China UnionPay 
and JCB, both regional card schemes, 
grew their purchase transaction value 
by 52% and 22% respectively from 2013 
to 2014, compared to the 8-14% growth 
during the same period by international 
card schemes American Express, Visa 
and MasterCard

A wide array of devices are now 
continually connected to each other, and 
contain more and more sensitive data, 
creating attractive targets for criminals. 
Threats to identity and other cybercrime 
are increasing rapidly and 70% of 
enterprises in the UK have now reported 
suffering an external cyber attack. The 
payments market is making significant 
ongoing investments in security 
technology, for example in single-use 
‘tokens’ which obscure a card number so 
that it is useless to a criminal; or in 
developing technology that can 
intelligently identify fraud and securely 
‘re-route’ the flow of funds and information 
between consumers and merchants. 
Regulators are also driving change and 
pushing for more innovation in payments, 
using this as a way to de-risk the industry 
and reduce the traditional reliance on 
banks. For the payments industry, this 
means the number of active regulators 
and sources of regulation now span 
traditional national regulators, such as the 
Financial Conduct Authority, to supra-
national regulators (e.g. European 
Payments Council), global industry bodies 
(Payment Card Industry Data Security 
Standard), domestic standards (UK Cards) 
and payment network rules (e.g. Visa and 
MasterCard).
Regulatory changes are increasingly 
multi-faceted and complex. These are 
potentially costly to implement but could 
also encourage technology-driven 
innovation in payments.
Risk, fraud and 
regulatory scrutiny 
are increasing  
the burden on 
merchants

Competitive landscape 
The payments landscape is fragmented 
with players ranging from a small number 
of global payments partners, to smaller 
players who compete in specific 
geographies or customer segments, to 
niche specialists who compete on specific 
expertise and partnership coverage. 
We believe that the most successful 
companies in the industry will be those 
that can provide merchants with access 
and connections to the global payments 
networks, who can deliver extensive and 
value-adding payments capabilities 
tailored to the markets they serve, and do 
so while leveraging a robust but flexible 
technology platform.  
We believe, over time, that the industry is 
well-suited to consolidation as payments 
become more global and the benefits of 
scale become even more relevant.  
Therefore as the market evolves, we 
believe the advantage lies with market 
participants who can:
  Maximise acceptance while minimising 
fraud: Companies that provide end-to-
end coverage and scale technology can 
keep pace with evolving threats.
  Meet the demand for omni-channel 
options: Payment partners need to 
offer a comprehensive range of 
integrated payment channels to 
maximise sales opportunities and 
ensure reconciliation in one place.
  Follow and support consumers globally: 
Providers need to establish a global 
network to provide access to 
international markets through local or 
alternative payment methods, currency 
conversion and settlement.
  Leverage the advantages of being able 
to process large volumes of data: Scale 
players capturing a high volume of 
transactions have a superior data set to 
exploit and the capital to invest in new 
products and services for merchants.   24

Our business model
We differentiate ourselves from our competitors through a 
combination of our people, global reach, modern technology, 
and an unparalleled network of partnerships and relationships.
Our objectives are simple – to deliver these three benefits 
to our customers: 
 More sales
 Lower cost 
 Less risk and fraud 
Realising the full potential of our business model should  
result in visible revenues and profitability, as well as strong 
and predictable cash flow generation. 
This will give us the ability to invest organically and in-organically, 
which will create sustainable value for shareholders and fulfil our 
financial objectives for the business.
We have a passion for our customers, our people and the 
products and services we provide.
Our business model supports our customers in growing their 
businesses and helps them prosper, which in turn contributes 
to facilitating growth across the wider economy. 26
Worldpay Group plc
Annual Report and Accounts 2015
Our business model: 
How it works
We provide our customers with access 
to our global payments network 
through a variety of mechanisms to 
accept payments.
Customers can access our network:
  At the point of sale, e.g. with a 
hardware terminal, a kiosk, a tablet, 
or a phone with an app
  On a website, through a customer’s 
own website, or using our payment 
pages
  Through a wide array of devices 
‘embedded’ with our payment 
technology, e.g. through gaming 
consoles, petrol pumps, and apps 
How we capture value
We collect fees depending on how  
our customer decides to access the 
network, ranging from a ‘pay per 
payment attempt’ on a website to a 
monthly rental fee for a hardware 
terminal, as well as fees to certify and 
secure the connection to our network.
We offer our customers the ability 
to process payments in 126 different 
transaction currencies and accept 
payment from the major international 
credit card networks and many local 
debit cards.
  We connect to over 300 proprietary 
payment networks, e.g. global card 
networks (Visa, MasterCard), 
regional networks (China UnionPay), 
local domestic networks (iDeal in 
the Netherlands), alternate 
payments (Boleto vouchers in 
Brazil), and emerging networks 
(Klarna in Europe, TenPay in China)
  We apply a range of real-time fraud 
and risk checks, both on our 
customer and the end consumer
  We underwrite the risk that the 
transaction may not be valid, or that 
the goods may not be as sold or 
delivered
How we capture value
We collect fees depending on the 
services our customer chooses, 
ranging from a few basis points 
for debit card transaction, to a 
percentage of the transaction 
value for a full fraud-checked,  
cross-border payment.
As money moves through our 
platform, we detect and prevent 
fraud at each step.
   We perform due diligence on 
new customers to protect 
end consumers
  Our platform checks the validity of 
the payment instrument, the payer 
and the customer at the point of a 
transaction
  We offer software tools for 
customers to set their own 
tolerance for risk, based on factors 
such as geographic location of 
the payer, the type of payment 
instrument, and dozens of other 
items of data
How we capture value
We collect fees for these services, 
ranging from a monthly subscription  
fee to a percentage of the value of  
the transaction.
Shareholders
We have a clear strategy for sustainable value creation for our 
shareholders using our core capabilities to generate growth.
Customers
We help our customers prosper through optimising business 
outcomes by reducing the chances of losing a potential sale, 
allowing them to get a single view of their own customer, and 
offering ways to save time and discover new ways to sell.

Our payments platform matches and 
verifies tens of millions of transactions 
every day. 
   We validate the fees and charges 
owed to the issuers of credit, card 
networks and other intermediaries, 
reconciling hundreds of millions 
of pounds across a vast array of 
parties in a few hours overnight
   We manage exceptions, errors and 
disputes from any of these parties, 
including if our customers fail to 
provide the product or service to 
the end consumer, and oversee 
the claim until it is resolved
How we capture value
We collect fees depending on the 
nature of the agreement with the 
credit issuers, card networks and 
other intermediaries. We also charge if 
the customer seeks advice for ways to 
lower their costs to these third parties. 
Our platform then applies a complex 
set of algorithms and rules to optimise, 
price and send funds to customers in 
the way they prefer.  We offer:
   A mix of currencies of their 
choosing in which to settle 
the funds owed to them
  A range of cross-border bank 
transfers to send funds to local 
accounts of their choosing
   A variety of other treasury services 
How we capture value
We collect fees in a variety of ways, 
ranging from a fee for each transfer, to 
recurring subscriptions, to a 
percentage of the value of the 
currency conversion.
We store transaction data to analyse 
trends and look for patterns across 
payment types, countries, and types of 
customer.
   We offer payment analytics and 
insights on peer groups and industry 
benchmarking to our customers to 
help them run loyalty schemes, 
guide their consumers to preferred 
payment types and improve their 
performance 
  We also use this data to help 
customers optimise their business 
by reducing drop-outs during the 
order or online checkout process, 
maximising transaction approval 
rates by configuring an optimal 
route for a payment, reducing 
costs by lowering risk of refunds, 
and optimising fees paid to other 
payment networks
How we capture value
We charge subscription fees for 
access to advanced reporting and 
analytics, and we also charge for 
advisory services for customers.
People
We invest heavily in the development of our people to create the 
next generation of leaders who find innovative and practical 
solutions for our customers, partners and regulators.

Worldpay Group plc
Annual Report and Accounts 2015
Our people are critical to our ability to 
deliver our strategy and have supported 
the growth of the business. We currently 
have 5,000 colleagues and contractors 
based in 13 countries.
At the time of our IPO in October 2015, we 
awarded shares to colleagues or gave 
them an equivalent cash bonus in 
jurisdictions where a share award wasn’t 
possible. Colleagues were awarded these 
shares without any restrictions and we are 
delighted that 67% of our current 
workforce are shareholders and will share 
in our future success.
2015 was a significant year for the 
development of our people strategy. We 
set out in this section three key focus 
areas, together with some of the highlights 
of the progress we made during the year.
Creating our culture
In January 2015, we launched the Worldpay 
Way – Work Smart, Be Spirited, Be 
Supportive. The initiative was developed in 
collaboration with colleagues across the 
Group to define how we wanted to behave 
and act in the future. Over the course of 
2015, we saw increased understanding and 
adoption of the Worldpay Way across the 
business. We have aligned some of the 
core people processes to the Worldpay 
Way and have used it extensively in our 
recruitment and development activity.
We are constantly curious, looking for 
brilliantly simple solutions and we make 
things happen and achieve amazing results. 
We are passionate about payments, our 
customers and colleagues. We are resilient 
and courageous in our thinking and actions. 
We care about each other, our customers 
and our Company and we are open and 
direct in our approach. We are always 
striving to do the right thing in the right way.
Creating our culture
  Establish a common way of working, 
using the Worldpay Way to make it 
easier to get things done and to be 
clear how we do them
  Create a working environment that 
supports our culture
Driving capability
  Recruit the best people 
  Grow talent pools, particularly around 
diversity networks
  Use our Worldpay Academy 
development resource to help 
colleagues reach their potential and 
progress within the organisation 
Engaging our teams
  Support our managers to lead brilliantly 
and engage their teams 
  Use the annual colleague engagement 
survey to benchmark engagement and 
managers’ ratings
  Improve awareness of our corporate 
responsibility activity
  Use our communication channels to 
explain our journey and support our 
colleagues

At the same time, we continue to invest in 
making our office environments support 
the culture we are creating: modern, bright 
and collaborative spaces, designed to suit 
new working styles and practices. In 2015, 
we opened a new regional head office in 
Sâo Paulo and started the local relocation 
of our Atlanta office in the US. 
Driving capability
During the year we made progress finding 
new opportunities to expand our talent 
pools. 
We aligned our recruiting tools to the 
Worldpay Way to support recruiting 
managers, and participated in recruitment 
events both within the technology sector, 
for example the Silicon Milkroundabout 
graduate career fair, and by inviting 
developers to our networking events. We 
also made progress as signatories of the 
Military Covenant, working in partnership 
with SaluteMyJob to host our first 
placement from the armed forces.
Looking internally, we supported the 
growth of two colleague networks – The 
Women of Worldpay (‘WOW’) and GLOW. 
WOW aims to attract more talented 
women to Worldpay, to encourage our 
women’s career development and 
leadership aspirations, and create an 
internal network of like-minded women 
(and men) across the business. Since its 
creation in October 2014, our WOW 
network has attracted 250 members 
across eight offices, in four countries. 
In March 2015, we launched a new network 
focused on our lesbian, gay, bisexual and 
transgender (LGBT) colleagues and 
straight allies. Known as GLOW, the 
network fosters a sense of belonging and 
inclusion, as well as enabling mentorship 
across business divisions.
In 2016, we plan to launch our Muslims of 
Worldpay (‘MOW’) network focusing on 
connecting Muslim colleagues, as well as 
increasing awareness and acceptance of 
Islamic culture and religion. 
We have also made significant progress in 
how we support colleagues’ development. 
The Worldpay Academy now hosts all our 
training and development activity, from 
induction and online compliance training to 
support for leadership development. We 
showed our commitment to Worldpay’s 
future leaders by investing in the creation of 
the ‘MA Management – International 
Payments Ecosystem’. The 24-month 
part-time programme was developed in 
partnership with Middlesex University and is 
fully funded by Worldpay. The MA will benefit 
not only the Company but colleagues, 
customers and the wider payments industry. 
Our first 24 students enrolled on the course 
in September 2015 and the second cohort is 
now being finalised.
We continue to use creative ideas to 
develop the next generation of leaders, 
and across the year over 30 high-potential 
colleagues have attended the ‘Worldpay 
Journey’, a course designed to prepare 
them for future managerial roles.
We are starting to see how our 
commitment to developing our people 
is making a difference. During 2015, 
colleagues attended some 3,000 face-to-
face training sessions and over 97% 
of colleagues completed mandatory 
compliance training. In addition, nine 
colleagues were promoted to the Group 
Senior Leadership Team (‘SLT’), meeting our 
objective of filling a greater proportion of 
our vacancies through internal promotions.
Engaging our teams
In 2015, we ran our first global engagement 
survey in partnership with Best Companies, 
building on the work we started in 2014. Our 
engagement score has risen over 68 points 
this year giving us a 1* accreditation level, 
improving last year’s ‘one to watch’ result. 
Every division and function increased their 
overall engagement scores. Participation 
across the Group was very good: at 72% it 
is some 24% higher than the average for 
large companies.
We have taken a number of themes from 
the results and given training and support 
to local managers to respond effectively 
to them at a local level.
And we do not only rely on the survey to 
understand what’s on colleagues’ minds. 
In 2015, we started to roll out our ‘Talk 
About People’ groups. These forums give 
colleagues the chance to speak with their 
senior management teams and raise local 
concerns or issues, supplementing the 
formal relationship we have with UNITE in 
the UK and the Works Council we operate 
in the Netherlands.
Most of our internal communications 
channels allow colleagues to comment, 
share or feed back and our internal 
communications are increasingly about 
creating a dialogue rather than a one-way 
broadcast of information. Colleagues 
around the world also regularly have the 
chance to see and speak with our senior 
leaders in informal settings. The score 
for the colleague engagement survey 
question ‘Our internal communications 
channels help me to understand our 
strategy’ increased 11 percentage points 
in the most recent survey.
Worldpay as an employer
We are committed to making Worldpay 
a truly great place to work.
In addition to competitive base salaries 
and benefits packages, the vast majority 
of Worldpay colleagues globally share in 
overall business success through variable 
pay schemes, for example annual bonuses 
or sales commission plans.
Beyond financial incentives, we have 
adopted policies and ways of working that 
encourage colleagues to work flexibly, 
complementing their responsibilities 
outside of work. 
In 2015, we increased the support we 
give colleagues with family commitments. 
In partnership with My Family Care we 
introduced ‘Work+Family’, a wealth of 
online resources, advice and practical 
assistance to help deal with issues related 
to the changing landscape of family life 
and an ageing population – issues like 
childcare and eldercare. 30
Worldpay Group plc
Annual Report and Accounts 2015
In addition to providing an anonymous 
helpline to allow colleagues to blow the 
whistle on any work-related issue, we also 
offer support for colleagues dealing with 
personal issues through an employee 
assistance helpline. 
Underpinning everything we do to make 
Worldpay a great place to work is our 
position on equal opportunities. We are 
fully committed to providing equal 
opportunities in the workplace, and we 
value diversity and embrace our 
differences which broaden our collective 
experiences and knowledge in the 
workplace. 
Being an equal opportunities employer 
means that we do not discriminate directly 
or indirectly in recruitment, promotion, 
training or employment because of age, 
disability, gender, gender reassignment, 
pregnancy, maternity, race (including 
colour, nationality and ethnic or national 
origins), sexual orientation, religion or 
belief, or because someone is married or 
in a civil partnership. Every effort will be 
made to accommodate the specific needs 
of disabled colleagues and reasonable 
adjustments will be made to working 
environments where possible.
More than 40% of our global workforce is 
female, which exceeds many private 
sector benchmarks. However, the gender 
spread is not reflected in our leadership 
teams or across all functions and we 
continue to work on a number of initiatives 
– including our women’s network WOW – 
to improve the representation of women 
throughout the business.

global payments platform which allows 
our customers to take payments in almost 
any way, using almost any payment 
method, in almost any location. This 
platform is integrated across the entire 
transaction process from the capture of a 
payment request, routing and authorising 
the transaction, then clearing and settling 
the funds. 
We are well advanced in our technical 
separation from RBS, having already 
migrated and upgraded our real-time 
authorisations engine, payment gateway 
components, and the merchant servicing 
back office and productivity systems. The 
only element of the technology platform 
still hosted at RBS is the clearing and 
settlement component which will be 
replaced by our new acquiring platform. 
The build of the new acquiring platform 
was completed at the end of 2015, and we 
are now building and testing the migration 
approach with a view to launching the new 
platform and starting to migrate our 
customers in 2016.
The payments platform
We have developed our proprietary global 
technology platform with software created 
by our own engineering talent and using 
our in-house intellectual property. It is 
deployed onto low-cost, high-performance 
infrastructure to perform at scale and 
enable reinvestment in the development of 
the platform.

Overview

Directors’ report

Shareholder information
 
The platform itself is made up of six sets of 
components:
   Interfaces to access the payments 
network: We offer a comprehensive 
range of integration points, built to 
meet the needs of each set of our 
customers. This provides access to our 
global payments network through card 
terminals, websites, mobiles and 
tablets, as well as technical integrations 
for start-ups and software developers.
   Gateways that route payments across 
the network: We have a wide range of 
gateways, each providing a specific 
capability for our customers, be it for 
payments across different channels 
with rich functionality at high speed or 
for tailored access into a local market. 
These components accept a payment 
and send it via the best route across the 
network depending on our customers’ 
appetite for risk, cost and acceptance.
  Value-added products and services: 
Our products include a risk 
management and fraud detection 
engine, local and alternative payment 
methods, a wide range of currencies, as 
well as a payment tokenisation engine 
to secure cardholder sensitive data.
  C o r e p ay m e n t s : We offer two in-house 
acquiring engines within our payments 
platform, one optimised for domestic 
payments in the United States, the 
other a global engine that accepts 
payments in 146 countries, including 
domestic payments in the United 
Kingdom, India, Japan and Canada, 
among others. We have full internal 
control and optimisation of payment 
authorisations, scheme and card 
network processing, billing rates and 
settlement. 
  D a t a : Since we own and operate the 
points of entry to our global payments 
network, the gateways, and the core 
payment processing, we are able to 
monitor, store and create insights by 
analysing the full cycle of payment data 
and traffic patterns. 
   C u s t o m e r s e r v i c e : We have 
components to manage the entire 
customer lifecycle, including payment 
exceptions (for example, chargebacks 
and other types of payment disputes).
We believe that our technology base will 
provide opportunities for significant 
operating leverage, as our payments 
platform has been designed and created 
to provide capacity for five to 20 times 
as much transaction volume as we 
currently process. This will also enable 
us to quickly upgrade and modify our 
payments platform in response to 
regulatory and other changes at a 
marginal incremental cost. 
T rack record of high performance 
Worldpay has a proven track record 
of reliable performance, stability and 
security. 
As each component of Worldpay’s 
platform has been migrated or integrated, 
performance has been upgraded by 
between two and ten times. For example, 
network bandwidth is now approximately 
16 times faster, authorisation response 
time is now approximately 3.5 times 
faster and anti-fraud responses are 
approximately four times faster compared 
to the previous system. 
These upgrades have been delivered 
whilst maintaining our payment service 
availability at near 100% on a global scale, 
and continuing to handle increased 
transaction volumes during each of our 
customers’ regional and global peak 
periods, including Singles Day in China 
(+400% of volumes compared to normal), 
Six Nations Rugby in the UK (+150%) and 
Black Friday in the US (+50%). 
We focus on security at every level. 
On average, we monitor approximately 
550 million events per day. All of the core 
payment components operated by us 
have been certified as PCI-DSS compliant, 
and we continue to develop new products 
and enhance existing ones to reduce our 
customers’ security exposure. Critical 
components of our technology have 
additional security measures, including 
nested firewalls and hardware security 
modules.
Advanced engineering capability and 
intellectual property
Our technology advantage is rooted in 
our  engineering and technology talent. 
Because we are pursuing growth in new 
markets and new propositions, we have 
made the strategic decision to invest 
heavily in building an internal capability to 
solve customer problems creatively and 
pragmatically, and to develop new products 
through technology. 
Our people have extensive expertise in 
payments and in our customers’ industries, 
and are able to combine that commercial 
knowledge with leading-edge engineering. 
As at 31 December 2015 we have more than 
1,500 colleagues dedicated to technology 
across six global engineering sites.
The engineering and operating teams 
continually seek to help merchants create 
a better understanding of their own 
business dynamics, including how to 
optimise their payment costs and to 
interpret data on shopper behaviour and 
seasonality. Intuitive interfaces aim to 
demystify payments data and trends, and 
we provide easy access to quick, targeted 
insights for small businesses via My 
Business Dashboard, a simple dashboard 
that delivers easily digestible reports to 
enable small businesses to understand 
their business’ performance over time. We 
have also channelled our understanding of 
customer needs with expertise in 
regulation and scheme compliance rules 
to provide one of the industry’s first 
automated on-boarding of new customers 
in as little as ten minutes, while remaining 
fully compliant with rules and regulations. 
An eye to the future
Worldpay is proactive in tracking and 
identifying market trends. These insights 
are then used to drive our research and 
development agenda, advise our 
customers and engage with regulators. 
Our research and development activities 
focus on:
  Technology innovation team: The 
technology division has a small team 
exclusively dedicated to working on 
innovative technologies. Projects and 
proof of concepts during 2014 and 2015  32
Worldpay Group plc
Annual Report and Accounts 2015
included crypto-currency integration 
modules for ecommerce gateways; 
identity validation capability through 
facial recognition at point of sale; the 
use of beacons for payment information 
in retail locations; ‘Internet of Things’ 
payment integrations in vehicles; the 
use of mobile devices as card 
acceptance terminals; and consumer 
protection standards in emerging 
‘invisible payments’ methods. 
  New product projects: For a major new 
product development, we will typically 
form an internal, standalone project 
team with a mandate to operate 
independently to drive a product to 
market quickly. Recent examples of this 
approach include the Worldpay Zinc 
mobile payment solution aimed at sole 
traders and other small businesses, and 
the online payments gateway aimed at 
developers seeking simple integrations 
with ecommerce gateways.
   Investment in early-stage ventures and 
start-up incubators: We engage actively 
with payments start-up businesses. We 
have invested in Pazien, a data analytics 
start-up. We are also an active 
participant in the Atlanta Technical 
Development Center start-up incubator 
at Georgia Tech University (the ‘ATDC’). 
Companies being supported by 
Worldpay at the ATDC are working on a 
number of payments-related 
developments, including ‘known 
customer’ services in the travel industry, 
healthcare patient data and payments, 
and mobile applications for products 
delivery providers and restaurants. 
  Participation in industry standards-
setting bodies: We are an active 
participant in key technical and 
industry bodies, including EMVCo and 
the PCI Security Standards Council 
Board of Advisors. Worldpay is the chair 
of the emerging Internet Payment 
Standard at the W3C. Worldpay 
participates in research and debate and 
aims to positively influence the 
direction of the payments industry.
Our business partners
At Worldpay, we hold ourselves to high 
business standards and we want to work 
with suppliers who do the same. We work 
smart, we’re spirited and we’re supportive, 
and these values are evident in all we do. 
That’s why we promote high legal, ethical, 
corporate and employee-related 
standards in our own business and ask our 
suppliers to do the same. 
To make sure our suppliers share our 
values, we introduced our Supplier Code 
of Conduct in 2015 as part of our 
procurement process. We now review 
supplier performance against this code 
and other ‘good health’ measures at 
regular governance meetings.
What’s more, in an effort to ensure our 
energy suppliers align to our values and 
ways of working, all new contracts are with 
‘green energy’ suppliers. 
As for our data centres, which are based in 
shared facilities, we strive to partner with 
responsible companies who share our 
values, such as SungardAS who provide 
two of our UK data centres and one in the 
US. We are working hard to consolidate 
our smaller data centre facilities into larger 
and more efficient sites.
Our corporate responsibility
Acting responsibly is an important part of 
our culture at Worldpay. We believe in 
doing things in the right way and as 
sustainably as possible – for us, our 
customers, our people and the 
communities we operate in. 
In 2015, our Corporate Responsibility (‘CR’) 
Council further defined and co-ordinated 
our CR agenda across the Group. The 
Council is made up of senior leaders from 
across Worldpay and is chaired by a 
member of our Executive Committee – 
Chief Human Resources Officer, Andy 
Doyle. In 2016, we plan to build on the work 
done in 2015 and set a Global CR strategy 
which leverages our core business 
capability and is delivered through 
relevant local initiatives.

We continue to be an active member of 
the Business in the Community (BITC) 
network where we share best practice and 
benchmark our activities.
Protecting the environment for future 
generations is important to us all, and at 
Worldpay we have put a number of 
practices in place to help us minimise our 
carbon emissions, including saving energy, 
recycling office waste and adopting 
paperless work practices.
The table below sets out our greenhouse 
gas (GHG) emissions for 2015 in tonnes of

1  The Companies Act 2006 (Strategic Report and 
Directors’ Report) Regulations 2013 requires 
quoted companies to report on greenhouse gas 
(GHG) emissions for which they are responsible. 
Worldpay Group plc listed on 13 October 2015.
2  Scope 1 data is made up of owned fleet vehicles 
and gas usage in the UK. Fleet vehicle data has 
been calculated using average mileage per vehicle 
with the emissions conversion factor based on a 
‘medium’ vehicle as stipulated by DEFRA. 
Purchased gas is used for gas boilers in two UK 
sites and not in any other building; this data has 
been gathered from our energy providers and 
conversion factors have been used as stipulated 
by DEFRA. Fugitive emissions have not been 
included in this submission, however it is expected 
that this value will make up less than 1% of our 
Scope 1 emissions.
3  Purchased electricity makes up 100% of our Scope 
2 emissions. This data has been gathered from our 
energy providers and conversion factors have 
been used as stipulated by DEFRA. Approximately 
50% of our UK electricity is ‘green’ energy. Up to 
1st August 2015, this was a guaranteed green 
energy source by the use of LEC’s (Levy 
Exemption Certificates). Since UK Government 
changes in legislation in 2015, this supply is now 
sourced through REGO’s (Renewable Energy 
Guarantee of Origin).
4  Scope 3 includes indirect travel use through our 
global operations. A travel policy has been in place 
in all locations other than US (Atlanta) since Q1 
2015 with plans to review globally in Q2 2016. 
Emissions from business travel cover global flights 
and rail for UK, US, The Netherlands and Singapore. 
We intend to improve our coverage for air, rail and 
car hire data to include all other locations in Q3 
2016. This data has been supplied by our travel 
management providers and converted by them 
using the relevant conversion factors.
5  This total includes information on all of our 
UK-based operations for Scope 1 and 2 and UK 
plus some overseas operations for Scope 3. We 
expect to be able to report full global data in the 
Annual Report and Accounts 2016.
6  The number of full time equivalent employees 
(‘FTEs’) used for the intensity ratio calculation was 
3,161, being the number of FTEs based in the UK.
All our new offices are designed and built 
with sustainability in mind. Both our 
London and Manchester offices have 
been assessed as ‘Excellent’ by BREEAM 
(Building Research Establishment 
Environmental Assessment Method) and 
the Royal Institute of Chartered Surveyors 
awarded gold and silver sustainability 
awards to our London and Manchester 
offices respectively. 
Where we have colleagues working in 
older buildings, we have taken action to 
reduce their environmental impact, 
including improving temperature control 
and reducing electricity consumption. For 
example, in Gateshead, we have installed 
LED panels which will reduce the total 
energy used on lighting by 61% and our 
carbon footprint by 34.79 tons. 
Non-profit partnerships
We are proud to use our scale, 
infrastructure and capabilities to support 
a number of charities in local 
communities. In 2015, we continued our 
partnership with Comic Relief as a 
‘platinum sponsor’, processing free of 
charge the 105,905 donations (worth 
£6.6m) made using Worldpay technology. 
We plan to build on our relationship with 
Comic Relief in 2016 by volunteering our 
call centres and colleagues in support of 
their annual televised events.
In 2015, we once again supported Cancer 
Research’s annual fundraising campaign, 
Stand Up To Cancer (‘SU2C’), which aims 
to bring forward the day when all cancers 
are cured. We’ve been supporting SU2C 
with free payments processing since it 
launched in 2012. The event raised £14.9m 
in total and we processed around 14,000 
transactions on the night. 
And our partnerships with charities go 
beyond processing payments. Colleagues 
around the world fundraise and give their 
time in support of charities and 
organisations that are important to them. 
Since October 2014, we have focused our 
corporate fundraising efforts on Great 
Ormond Street Hospital in London. We 
initially set ourselves the challenge of 
raising £100,000 to fund a state-of-the-art 
bedroom in the hospital’s new clinical 
building. By the end of 2015, we had raised 
£160,000 from combined colleagues’ 
efforts and Worldpay’s matched 
donations.

World Duty Free Group
World Duty Free Group is one of the 
world’s leading airport retailers, with over 
500 outlets in 20 countries. They aim to 
offer the ultimate airport shopping 
experience and provide an efficient 
service to high volumes of customers, 
even at peak times.
The challenge
The airport retailer needed a payment 
partner that would help them to serve 
customers in the newly re-opened 
Heathrow Terminal 2 as quickly as possible 
but at the same time provide an 
exceptional level of service. London 
Heathrow is the world’s busiest 
international airport and therefore they 
needed a flexible, cost-effective way for 
staff to take payments, not just at the till, 
but throughout the store.
The solution
World Duty Free Group chose Worldpay 
Total Mobile, a payment app that can be 
installed on a tablet or mobile device 
which connects to a portable card reader. 
This enabled shop assistants to roam the 
shop floor, assisting customers in their 
shopping journey and taking payments on 
the spot. Worldpay Total Mobile also offers 
daily, monthly and weekly analytics for all 
card readers, allowing the retailer to better 
manage staff during peak times and 
improve their customers’ shopping 
experience in the future. 
The solution has reduced queues and 
the number of lost sales, since purchases 
can be made quickly and easily when 
customers are in a rush. In addition, the 
average transaction value in-store has 
increased by around 40% on the Worldpay 
Total Mobile devices compared with sales 
on the main tills, and fewer purchases are 
abandoned by customers who have run 
out of time to shop before boarding.
With Worldpay Total Mobile 
we can react to situations 
very quickly depending on 
when and where we 
get busy.

China Southern Airlines
China Southern Airlines operates the 
largest fleet, one of the most developed 
route networks, and the largest passenger 
capacity of any airline in The People’s 
Republic of China. Worldpay has been 
working with the business since mid-2012. 
The challenge
China Southern Airlines needed a reliable 
payments partner with global payment 
coverage to help them enter new markets. 
They also needed a provider with 
experience in the airline sector to guide 
their payment strategy and defend them 
against fraud threats. 
The solution
Worldpay provides China Southern Airlines 
with its acquiring, alternative payments 
and risk management services. Specifically, 
China Southern Airlines uses Worldpay’s 
RiskGuardian fraud management tool, a 
flexible solution that can be tailored to 
suit their individual requirements. This tool 
helped to improve China Southern Airlines’ 
fraud and chargeback ratios by 85%. At the 
same time, their transaction acceptance 
rates saw an increase of 3%. 
Additionally, our expert analytics team have 
been able to provide access to data trends 
that determine how carriers like China 
Southern Airlines can improve their global 
payments strategies. Worldpay has held 
multiple training workshops and refresher 
sessions with China Southern Airlines’ team 
to cover a multitude of topics from payment 
queries and dispute management to 
reconciliation best practices. 
Worldpay provides us 
with global acquiring 
services and has helped us 
expand our global reach to 
new markets for airline 
ticketing sales.

Smithy Garage
Smithy Garage is a small business offering 
servicing and repairs for cars and vans. 
The garage was started by Alan and Ellen 
Moon 12 years ago and is based in the 
North West of the UK near Preston. 
The challenge
In the UK, small business owners can spend 
more time on financial administration than 
they do on selling. Alan and Ellen were 
looking for a payment provider to help 
chart their financial data in a simple and 
informative way, to help them make sense 
of their cash flows and manage their 
business more efficiently. 
The solution
Worldpay’s My Business Dashboard has 
helped Alan and Ellen to minimise time 
spent on financial administration so they 
can get back to what matters – keeping 
the business moving forward.
The online tool is an intuitive online 
portal that helps small business owners 
make informed decisions through better 
visibility of their data, while providing them 
with the same tools and insights that are 
used by larger corporates. It provides easy 
to navigate downloadable reporting on 
card transactions, online invoices, cash 
flow overviews and sales trends, giving 
them instant access to the financial data 
they need to run their business. 
We have a cash flow that 
we need to monitor closely. 
I think the dashboard is 
excellent as you can look at 
what the credit or debit 
card payments have been 
to our business.

UK 
In the UK, we have the number one market 
share, accounting for approximately 42% 
of the UK merchant market. We provide 
payment acceptance solutions across all 
channels for approximately 300,000 UK 
and Ireland-based customers, from SMEs 
to larger corporates.
US
In the US market, we provide payments 
acceptance across all channels for 
US-based customers, including 
approximately 109,000 SME customers. We 
also provide industry-specific solutions for 
our approximately 13,000 enterprise 
customers in the grocery, petroleum, 
restaurant and retail industries.
These markets are the areas where the 
Worldpay business model is most 
effective. It is in these markets where we 
can distinguish ourselves most easily from 
our competition, given our comprehensive 
knowledge of payments, our multi-channel 
capabilities and our global coverage. 
Winning in these segments requires a 
deep understanding of the fundamental 
needs and behaviours of our customers 
and also of their consumers. We have 
therefore developed industry sector 
teams within Worldpay around some of 
the most attractive industry verticals such 
as airlines, digital content and travel. 
Corporate customers with complex needs 
typically have to address significant 
payment complexity, negotiating multiple 
payment methods, currencies, channels 
and regulatory hurdles, whether locally or 
globally.
This deep understanding is also relevant 
for SMEs: Worldpay helps small business 
owners and managers to navigate the 
increasingly complex world of payments 
by providing products and services that 
are easy to use, that can integrate into 
their other business processes and that 
maximise their sales opportunities. 
Worldpay is committed to helping all its 
customers to:
1 .  I n c r e a s e s a l e s : by opening up new 
payment channels, accessing new 
international markets, maximising 
payment acceptance rates and 
providing value-added services such as 
insights into their business
2 .  R e d u c e c o s t s : by eliminating the costs 
associated with managing cash 
payments and providing a single, 
unified solution, removing the need for 
multiple suppliers
3 .  R e d u c e r i s k : by using proprietary 
analytical tools to identify and eliminate 
fraudulent transactions whilst 
simultaneously reducing ‘false 
positives’
Worldpay focuses on specific groups of 
customers in larger corporates, 
particularly those with complex and 
international payment needs, and in SMEs 
(Small and Medium Enterprises). Our larger 
corporate customers, many of whom 
operate internationally, require us to have 
a deep understanding of their strategy for 
growth, to allow us to help them operate 
across countries and currencies. Our SME 
customers have needs that are 
predominantly domestic in nature, and 
require products and services tailored to 
their own industry. For example, the 
solution for a hotel is markedly different 
from that of a clothing store. 
Worldpay operates in three principal 
markets:
Global eCom
In Global eCom, where the market is highly 
fragmented with few global or scale 
providers, we focus on five market 
segments based on their growth potential, 
the opportunity created by the complexity 
inherent in merchants’ needs, and the fit 
with our product and service offering. We 
believe we have significant room to grow 
in this large market.  44

markets than our competition.
While we will continue to develop and 
refine our products, we will also invest 
internally to improve our engineering 
capability. We will equip our engineers with 
new tools, increasing developer capacity 
and improving speed to market, as well as 
embedding insights from our data into the 
products and services we offer. Some of 
our new products in development include:
  My Business Hub: a tablet-based smart 
point-of-sale solution. 
  Y o u r M a r k e t p l a c e : a data and insights 
proposition for our corporate customers.
  T o k e n i s at io n : a Token Store and 
Tokenisation service that replaces the 
shopper’s card details with a ‘single-use’ 
card number that cannot be used for 
any future payments and is therefore 
useless to a potential hacker.
  Hosted Payment Pages: a secure web 
payment service which provides a 
seamless transition upon checkout 
from a customer’s shopping website to 
our own payment pages. 46

  Continue to invest in our people
We operate in a growing market, and aim 
to expand with our existing customers, 
helping them to prosper and grow their 
businesses. In order to maximise our 
opportunities for growth, we target 
fast-growing segments in the economies 
we support, and those customers with 
complex needs and therefore the greatest 
demand for our existing and new products 
and services.
We also seek to grow by winning new 
customers in target segments, where we 
can use our existing expertise to address 
their specific requirements, and by 
broadening our expertise into new 
segments, developing products, 
partnerships and technologies to adapt 
our payments platform to their 
requirements. 
To do this, we continue to invest in the 
capabilities of our sales, marketing and 
ongoing customer support and advisory 
teams to deepen and broaden our 
expertise.
We also expect to increase our 
addressable market by further broadening 
our reach, by expanding into new 
geographies, both with our existing 
customers, and by winning new customers 
in these countries. 48

   Invest in our people to drive further 
improvements in employee

Our business is highly cash generative, 
enabling significant levels of investment to 
deliver better outcomes for customers. 
We have invested heavily in the Group’s 
infrastructure and people, in each of our 
three operating divisions, and in the 
technology separation from RBS. We 
expect to benefit in the future from this 
investment by expanding our margins as 
we grow the business, by improving free 
cash flow generation as we pass the peak 
of investment, and by improving efficiency 
and productivity. 
We also intend to reinvest to support 
future growth and innovation, and to 
embed new technology capabilities in the 
products and services we offer. As we 
continue to build a more integrated, more 
efficient payments network, the 
opportunity for more consistent cross-
selling and up-selling will increase. This 
upgraded payments network will also 
create more opportunity for us to provide 
end-to-end payments solutions across all 
of our markets, channels and products. 50

The increase in 2015 of 14% reflects 
growth in all of our operating divisions. 
Details of the drivers for growth in each 
division are included in the Operating 
review on pages 67 to 70.
Medium-term target

Definition
Total transactions is the aggregate 
number of transactions processed by 
the Group on behalf of customers. This 
KPI represents the number of discrete 
contracts the Group has with a given 
customer on a given transaction, and 
therefore may count the same 
transaction more than once, if multiple 
services are provided by the Group.

Performance in 2015 vs target:
Achieved 
The fall in average transaction value 
(‘ATV’) for the Group was at a lower rate 
than seen in the previous year and in 
line with expectations. Whilst the Group 
KPI is impacted by the mix effect from 
different growth rates across the three 
operating divisions, there have also 
been drivers of falling ATV within each 
business. Further details are included in 
the Operating review on pages 67 to 70.
Medium-term target
We do not expect large changes in ATV 
although mix impacts will continue.

Risk management
Our vision is to be the world’s most 
progressive and reliable payments partner, 
sharing insights and helping our 
customers prosper. It is critical that we 
understand and manage the risks inherent 
in attaining this vision, and therefore we 
regard risk as a core competency in 
ensuring that we meet our strategic goals.
We placed our customers at the heart of 
our thinking when we designed our 
enterprise risk management framework 
(‘ERMF’) and they are a fundamental 
consideration in all areas of our 
operations, from the creation of the 
Group’s strategy through to new product 
development and operational discussions 
with our customers. Rigorous 
management of the risks inherent in our 
activities ensures the right outcomes are 
achieved for both Worldpay and our 
customers.
The ERMF has evolved throughout 2015 to 
provide a clearer and more complete 
framework, driving our approach to the 
management of risk. The framework sets 
out the activities, tools and techniques 
used to ensure that all material risks are 
identified and that a consistent approach 
is integrated into business management 
and decision making across the Group. 
This includes a detailed mapping 
exercise which has been conducted to 
ensure that all of the risks identified in 
our IPO Prospectus are incorporated 
as key elements of the thematic risks 
disclosed here.
The diagram below illustrates our ERMF 
with the core anchors to the framework 
being our vision and our strategic pillars.

Worldpay Group plc
Annual Report and Accounts 2015
Risk governance
We expect every employee of Worldpay to 
be responsible for the management of risk, 
with the Board of Directors ultimately 
responsible for the management and 
governance of risk across the Group. To 
facilitate the exercise of their duties, 
Worldpay operates a ‘three lines of 
defence’ model which clearly identifies 
accountabilities and responsibilities for 
risk as follows:
  Business line management has primary 
responsibility for the management of 
risk; 
  Risk and compliance functions assist 
management in developing their 
approach to fulfil their responsibilities; 
and
  The Internal Audit function checks that 
the risk management process and the 
risk management framework are 
effective and efficient. 
The Board exercises its obligations in 
managing risk through the Group Risk 
Committee. The Committee operates 
under a delegated authority from the 
Board and is responsible for, among other 
things, articulating the Group’s risk 
appetite, reviewing the overall risk profile 
of the Group, providing objective 
challenge on the risks identified and 
assessing the effectiveness of the control 
framework. The Committee meets as 
required and is chaired by Deanna 
Oppenheimer. 
In addition, Worldpay operates a Group 
Governance and Control Committee 
which provides the senior management of 
the Group with a forum to review and 
discuss the activities of the Group’s 
assurance functions and the operational 
risk profile. 
Risk culture
We aim to create a risk culture that is 
centred around risk awareness, openness, 
continuous improvement and 
incentivising correct behaviours to ensure 
an appropriate outcome for both Worldpay 
and our customers. This objective is 
articulated through the Worldpay Way in a 
set of values which have been defined by 
the Board, supported by the Group 
Executive and developed in conjunction 
with our people.
The values which are shown on page 28 
are the key components by which the 
appropriate culture and behaviours 
defined by the Board in collaboration with 
our colleagues are embedded throughout 
Worldpay. The Employee Performance 
Management Programme within Worldpay 
ensures that colleague performance is 
regularly reviewed and assessed against 
Worldpay’s values.

Risk appetite
During 2015, our consideration of our 
appetite for risk was further developed 
based upon a consolidation of the Risk 
function’s enterprise analysis of current 
and future risk exposures, with due regard 
to the most practical and relevant level of 
appetite, limits and delegated authorities. 
Eight principal risk categories have been 
identified and each has been assigned a 
qualitative risk appetite statement 
supplemented by various principal risk 
metrics. Defining a concise set of strategic 
risk appetite statements is intended to 
focus the Board’s attention on the 
material risks to our business and assist  
in assessing business plans, objectives 
and strategy.
Risk monitoring and reporting
Worldpay adopts an Enterprise Risk 
Management (‘ERM’) approach to risk 
reporting to deliver the following benefits: 
  Integrated as opposed to silo-based 
risk reporting;
  Risk reporting linked to strategic and 
corporate objective risks as well as 
operational and business resilience 
risks;
  Standardisation of the reporting 
templates and risk language used 
across the business.
Strategic risk reporting
The Risk function aggregates and 
co-ordinates the operational risk 
information submitted from across the 
business each month to produce 
executive level risk reports.
STRUCTURE OF RISK-RELA TED INFORMA TION FLOWS A T OPERA TIONAL AND STRA TEGIC LEVELS
Regardless of whether or not risk reporting 
is focused at the strategic level or 
business process level, Worldpay uses the 
same risk likelihood and impact matrices 
to quantify and categorise the reporting of 
risk. This helps to ensure consistency of 
reporting and helps to remove a level of 
subjectivity (accepting that the potential 
crystallisation of risks is always going to 
include an element of subjectivity). 
It is important to note that the risk 
registers are not designed to capture all of 
Worldpay’s operational risks, but the key 
risks across Worldpay, which if not 
managed appropriately could result in 
escalation to Executive and Risk 
Committee’s (through ERM reporting) and 
potentially threaten the achievement of 
corporate objectives.
The following diagram highlights the 
structure of risk-related information flows 
at operational and strategic levels. The 
Chief Risk Officer is the focal point and 
driver of integrated risk reporting. 58

We will realise the full potential  
of our business model 
page 48
The payments industry is constantly changing and sector developments, mandatory 
industry changes that are not correctly implemented or an inability to adhere to 
scheme rules could result in unanticipated or unbudgeted penalties.
Worldpay’s acquiring business model is dependent upon licences from the international 
payment systems such as Visa and MasterCard. These are licences that are restricted 
in geographical scope and must be used in compliance with the rules and regulations 
set out by the relevant card franchise. Worldpay’s ability to obtain licences to expand 
into new countries is reliant on the relevant card franchise’s willingness to grant the 
licence. Similarly, changes in a card franchise’s rules and regulations, or in its 
interpretation and enforcement of them, can result in Worldpay having to curtail its 
business in order to ensure compliance with the changes or revised interpretations.
As a member of Visa Europe, Worldpay is also currently entitled to receive certain 
rebates and/or other financial incentives that are determined by reference to the 
volume of transactions Worldpay processes through Visa Europe. Visa Inc. and Visa 
Europe announced in November 2015 a definitive agreement for Visa Inc. to acquire 
Visa Europe. The transaction is subject to regulatory approvals and is currently 
expected to close in the second quarter of 2016. In the event that Visa Europe 
demutualises and becomes owned by Visa Inc., these rebates and/or other financial 
incentives are expected to cease.
Risk appetite
Worldpay will always seek to remain current and adhere to all regulations unless we 
are prevented from doing so by our system infrastructure. Where this is the case, 
Worldpay will apply for specific waivers pending full compliance.

Annual Report and Accounts 2015
UK membership of the European Union 
The UK Government has announced that a 
referendum will be held on 23 June 2016 to 
decide whether the UK should remain in 
the European Union (‘EU’). At Worldpay, we 
have analysed what this could mean for 
our business. A possible effect on 
Worldpay would be from macro-economic 
disruption, which may impact a proportion 
of the merchants we serve in the UK and 
Europe, and therefore our transactional 
flows. As a significant proportion of the 
regulatory regime we operate within 
comes from the EU, an exit may also 
change the framework applicable to our 
European operations.
However, given the global nature of our 
business and our experience working 
across multiple regulatory regimes, our 
current expectation is that this would not 
have a material effect on our business 
overall.
Going concern 
In considering the going concern basis for 
preparing the financial statements, the 
Board have reviewed the Group’s trading 
forecasts for the 12-month period from the 
date of approval of the Annual Report and 
Accounts. These forecasts, which include 
detailed cash flow projections, comprise 
assumptions as to sales and profit 
performance by operating division and by 
month. The forecasts demonstrate the 
Group’s ability to operate within its current 
borrowing facilities. They also illustrate 
that the Group has significant covenant 
and liquidity headroom in its borrowing 
facilities to support its operations for the 
foreseeable future. 
Notwithstanding the above, however, 
there remains a risk that a downturn in the 
economy could result in the Group’s sales 
and profits being worse than the Board is 
currently envisaging. As a result, the 
Directors have also reviewed forecasts 
which include sensitivities that make 
allowance for this risk. Should such a 
scenario arise, the Directors are confident 
they have adequate liquidity and covenant 
headroom to ensure that the Group can 
meet its liabilities as they fall due for the 
foreseeable future.
Accordingly, the Directors believe that it is 
appropriate to prepare the financial 
statements on a going concern basis.
Viability statement
In accordance with provision C.2.2 of the 
2014 UK Corporate Governance Code, the 
Directors have assessed the viability of 
the Group over the three years to 
December 2018. This assessment has 
been made taking account of the current 
position of the Group, the corporate 
planning process and the Group’s principal 
risks.
 
The corporate planning process includes 
the preparation of the annual budget as 
well as the Group’s longer-term strategic 
plan. The strategic plan provides medium 
to long-term direction for the Group and is 
reviewed on an annual basis. It includes a 
five-year outlook for the business. 
However, the Directors have determined 
that a three-year period is a more 
appropriate period over which to assess 
the viability of the Group as this provides 
a much greater degree of certainty. This is 
because the majority of contracts with 
customers are for a period of three years 
or less. In addition, we operate in fast-
growing and dynamic markets which 
makes it difficult to predict how 
regulations will evolve beyond a three-year 
timeframe and what the consequential 
impact might be on the Group’s activities.
As part of the strategic planning process, 
the Board carried out a robust assessment 
of the principal risks facing the Group, 
including those that could threaten its 
business model, future performance, 
solvency or liquidity. Eight principal risks 
have been identified as follows: industry 
change; legal and regulatory change; 
settlement risk; credit risk; data security; 
technology risk; scale of change; and 
reliance on third parties carrying out core 
business activities. These principal risks, 
together with potential impacts and 
mitigations, are set out on pages 58 to 65 
of the Strategic report. Stress tests are 
performed on the financial plan after 
considering the potential impact of 
principal risks and uncertainties. 
The geographical and sector 
diversification of the Group’s operations 
helps minimise the risk of serious business 
interruption or catastrophic damage to 
our reputation. Furthermore, our business 
model is structured so that the Group is 
not reliant on one particular group of 
customers or sector. No single customer 
accounts for more than 3% of Group net 
revenue and our top ten customers 
account for less than 12% of Group 
revenue.
In addition to management’s and the 
Board’s review of the output from the 
annual strategic planning process, the IPO 
process that took place in 2015 also 
provided further scrutiny and analysis of 
the strategic plan.
The Directors have concluded, based on 
the extent of the Group’s strategic 
planning process and its strong financial 
position, that there is a reasonable 
expectation that the Group has adequate 
resources to remain in operation and meet 
its liabilities as they fall due over the next 
three years.

Shareholder information
 
Worldpay operates in three principal 
markets – Global eCom, the UK and the 
US. These markets are described on page 
43 of the ‘Our strategy’ section of the 
Strategic report.
The financial information presented and 
discussed in this review is based on 
underlying financial performance and 
includes pro forma prior year comparatives.
Our Global eCom division focuses on 
large, internet-led multinationals that 
operate in fast-growing markets and have 
complex payment needs. We provide a 
wide range of payment services, both 
online and by mobile, to accept, validate 
and settle payments in 126 currencies 
across 146 countries, using any one of over 
300 payment methods. Our customers 
also use our payments technology to 
maximise the rate at which payments are 
approved, manage the risk of fraud, and 
optimise their costs of operating globally.
We focus on five priority verticals: Digital 
Content, Global Retail, Airlines, Regulated 
Gambling and Travel. Through this focus, 
we build our knowledge and expertise of 
our customers’ businesses and the 
specific needs of their own industry as it 
relates to payments.
In 2015, we enhanced the value of what we 
offer to our customers through a series of 
improvements to our products and services. 
We launched a set of upgrades to our core 
payment capabilities, including ‘Hosted 
Payment Pages’, a tokenisation service 
and ‘Worldpay Edge’. ‘Hosted Payment 
Pages’ allow a secure and seamless 
transition upon checkout from a 
customer’s shopping website to our own 
payments pages. Our tokenisation service 
replaces the shopper’s card details with a 
‘single-use’ card number that cannot be 
used for any future payments and is 
therefore useless to a potential hacker. 
‘Worldpay Edge’ is a deep data analytics 
service that allows customers to better 
understand shopper behaviour and 
performance.
We expanded the reach of our payments 
network into more markets, allowing more 
of our customers the ability to expand 
globally, with licences in Canada and 
Japan. We were one of the first payment 
companies to support Apple’s launch of 
Apple Pay in the UK and Europe, and we 
have integrated our payments platform to 
new local payment methods, for example 
Billdesk (used in India) and TenPay (used in 
China). 
Performance review
Our Global eCom division had another 
strong year of growth in 2015 with 
transactions up 31% to 3.8 billion, driven by 
increased volumes across a range of 
products and verticals. Average 
transaction values fell 12% year-on-year, 
however, as a significant proportion of the 
volume growth came from verticals where 
high volume, low value transactions 
dominate, such as Digital Content and 
Global Retail.
Net revenue increased by £45.7m, or 17%, 
to £317.7m in the year ended 31 December 
2015 (2014: £272.0m), with net acquiring

GLOBAL ECOM 68
Worldpay Group plc
Annual Report and Accounts 2015
Net acquiring income grew by 20% in 2015 
as a result of new business wins and 
growth of existing customers, particularly 
in Digital Content, Travel and Global Retail. 
Scheme fees increased significantly 
during the period, largely as a result of 
volume growth and country mix. In 
addition, a number of new rules and fees 
were implemented by the schemes in the 
year which increased fees further. The 
majority of these increases were charged 
on to customers. 
Revenue from treasury management and 
foreign exchange services grew by 22% 
year-on-year as a result of increased 
volumes in Airlines, Travel and Digital 
Content. Gateway income was also up 
26%, driven by volume increases in Global 
Retail and Travel and the contribution 
from Cobre Bem, our provider of gateway 
service solutions in Latin America.
Global eCom’s underlying net revenue  
as a percentage of total transaction value 
remained strong at 0.32% for the year 
ended 31 December 2015, in line with the 
prior year.
Underlying EBITDA increased by £22.7m,  
or 14%, to £184.2m in the year ended  
31 December 2015 (2014: £161.5m). This 
increase was driven principally by the 
growth in net revenue noted above but 
was offset, in part, by £22.9m higher 
operating costs year-on-year. This increase 
in operating costs partly reflects the 
growth in revenue, but also the investments 
we have made in people and capability, in 
both 2014 and 2015, to develop the 
organisation and deliver further sales 
growth in the future. In addition, bad debts 
increased compared to the prior year.
WPUK provides in-store, phone, online and 
mobile payment acceptance solutions for 
approximately 300,000 UK and Ireland-
based customers, from SMEs to large 
corporates (including T esco, Asda and Next). 
To strengthen Worldpay’s leadership in the 
UK, our strategy is to evolve from simple 
payment processing to become an 
added-value payment services and 
solutions partner for our merchants, 
across all of our market segments – SME, 
Small Corporate and Large Corporate. The 
strategy has three strands, with core 
growth being driven by a focus on ‘Brilliant 
Basics’ and ‘Multi-Service Penetration’, 
while we also seek new growth 
opportunities from transformational 
products and services.
The success of ‘Brilliant Basics’ can be 
seen in the number of new merchants 
on-boarded through our core channels, 
which increased significantly during the 
second half of 2015. We achieved this 
through a focus on increasing lead 
generation, improving sales conversion, 
and working to improve the overall 
end-to-end efficiency of our sales model, 
including the final stages of the Cardsave 
integration. Further improvements in our 
merchant retention operations, combined 
with a focus on improving customer 
experience by addressing the common 
causes of complaints, also led to a 
reduction in overall churn rates in the 
second half of the year. 
We also made significant progress with 
‘Multi-Service Penetration’. The 
penetration of ecommerce/CNP products 
amongst new merchants grew by 12% in 
the last 12 months, driven by a clear focus 
across our marketing and sales teams. 
During Q4, we implemented a ‘sales-
through-service’ pilot to promote cross-
sales activities within the customer 
service desk. Following the success of this 
pilot, we plan to roll out the initiative to full 
capacity during 2016. Finally, in Q4, we 
launched Worldpay Business Finance in 
partnership with Liberis to provide UK 
SMEs with access to flexible financing via 
a business cash advance. To date over 
£2m of funding has been provided to our 
merchants by Liberis, and we expect to 
continue to build on this progress in 2016.
T ransformational products and services are 
the drivers for both new revenue growth and 
increased merchant engagement. In May 
2015, we launched My Business Dashboard, 
our online reporting portal for SME 
customers, and it had over 14,000 active 
users by the end of the year. My Business 
Hub, a tablet-based smart point-of-sale 
solution, was launched in pilot with a small 
number of merchants in Q4. We have 
received extremely positive feedback on 
both products and they will be scaled up 
significantly in 2016. Worldpay T otal and 
Worldpay T otal Mobile, our omni-channel 
solutions for corporate customers, 
continued to register strong sales in the 
Large Corporate sector. These products 
have been instrumental in winning new 
Corporate business against our key 
competitors, as well as cross-selling new 
services to existing Corporate customers.

Performance review
Our WPUK division grew strongly in 2015 
with transactions up 8% to 5.4 billion, 
driven by new customer wins in both the 
Corporate and SME sectors and 
continuing growth in the use of cards as a 
payment mechanism. Average transaction 
values fell 4% year-on-year, however, 
reflecting high street price competition, 
particularly in the supermarket sector 
where Worldpay has a high market share, 
and changing consumer behaviour as the 
use of contactless increases. 
Net revenue increased by £39.2m, or 11%, 
to £405.2m in the year ended 31 December 
2015 (2014: £366.0m), with net acquiring 
income accounting for the majority of the 
increase. Net acquiring income grew by 
18% reflecting the impact of higher 
transaction volumes and effective 
management of pricing on new business 
and renewals, as well as a net positive 
impact of lower interchange costs on the 
acquiring margin which funded the 
enhancement of our propositions for 
customers. 
Ancillary income

 grew by 9% year-on-year 
as a result of increases in authorisation, 
gateway and other fees.
WPUK’s net revenue as a percentage of total 
transaction value increased slightly to 0.20% 
for the year ended 31 December 2015 from 
0.19% in the prior year, reflecting a change in 
mix to more credit card transactions and 
commercial pricing decisions.
Underlying EBITDA increased by £23.1m, 
or 15%, to £179.2m in the year ended 
31 December 2015 (2014: £156.1m). This 
improvement was driven by the growth in 
net revenue noted above and strong cost 
control, underpinned by a drive towards 
greater efficiency. Operating costs 
increased in the year by £4.7m, or 3%, 
reflecting the higher volumes as well as 
investment to drive future growth. The 
cost growth was at a significantly lower 
rate than the net revenue growth, leading 
to an overall improvement in profit margin.
WPUS provides in-store, online and mobile 
payment acceptance solutions for 
US-based customers, with a focus on 
developing omni-channel and integrated 
payment solutions for its approximately 
109,000 SME customers, and vertical-
specific solutions for its approximately 
13,000 enterprise customers in the 
Grocery, Petroleum, Restaurant and Retail 
industries. In addition, we provide ATM 
services to approximately 100 
organisations across the United States.
Our Corporate Business Unit, focused on 
larger clients operating nationally, continued 
to grow strongly in 2015. Our strategy to 
differentiate in this segment using a 
service-based approach to different vertical 
industries – especially Petroleum, Quick 
Serve Restaurants and Grocery Retail, 
where customer needs and requirements 
are often unique – is being validated with 
significant growth in locations, transactions 
and revenues. Furthermore, our competitive, 
value-based and high touch approach to 
clients is driving long-term client retention 
and life-time value. During 2015, we added to 
our vertical specialisms by extending our 
reach in the growing and attractive official 
payments sector that comprises federal, 
state and local government payments as 
well as utility payments.
WPUS’ Small Business Unit is focused  
on delivering powerful but affordable 
payment solutions to SMEs across the 
Unites States through multiple routes to 
market. In 2015, we delivered strong 
performance in terms of new sales and 
customer retention. We also continued our 
transformational journey to become  
a leading payment processing partner to 
the thousands of software, hardware and 
technology providers that power the 
point-of-sale environment for the more 
than seven million small and medium-sized 
businesses across the country. Customer 
acquisition in the Small Business Unit is 
delivered through a range of both direct 
and indirect/partner channels.  
In order to accelerate our evolution to be 
the payments partner of choice, we 
completed our integration of the 
SecureNet business and have delivered 
the forecast operational efficiencies in line 
with our expectations. We have now built a 
technical connection between the 
SecureNet platform and the WPUS Lynk 
platform that will allow clients to have 
access to the ease of technical integration 
offered through SecureNet, as well as to 
the rich payment processing features that 
we already possess.
The US marketplace is moving to the EMV 
payment standard, requiring merchants to 
upgrade their point-of-sale systems to 
accept EMV chip-based cards. Over the 
past year, WPUS invested heavily in EMV, 
middleware and unattended testing tools, 
simplifying the certification process, as well 
as creating a repeatable, scalable solution 
for merchants and partners. We will 
continue to invest further in EMV in 2016.

Annual Report and Accounts 2015
We also made significant progress in 
certifying integrated software vendors 
(‘ISVs’), partners, and merchants. During 
the year, we signed over 80 partners, 
including partners providing services now 
integrated into our SME payment 
solutions, together with partners providing 
referrals and other sources of new 
customer income streams.
In addition to payment processing, we 
continued to offer value added services, 
such as third-party working capital 
solutions delivered through the payment 
processing and settlement cycle, which 
provide financing options outside of 
traditional bank loans to help SMEs 
manage and grow their business.
Performance review
Our WPUS division had a solid year of 
growth in 2015 with transactions up 9% to 
3.8 billion, driven by increased volumes 
across all business segments as well as 
the acquisition of SecureNet. Average 
transaction values decreased by 2% 
year-on-year, reflecting developments in 
the Petroleum vertical where a decline in 
wholesale oil prices resulted in lower 
prices to consumers at the pump.
Net revenue increased by £33.4m, or 15%, 
to £258.8m in the year ended 31 December 
2015 (2014: £225.4m). Excluding the impact 
of the SecureNet acquisition in December 
2014 and the foreign currency translation 
impact, net revenue increased by £7.1m, or 
3%. This increase was driven principally by 
growth in acquiring income, reflecting the 
increase in transaction volumes. Net 
revenue as a percentage of total 
transaction value remained in line with the 
prior year at 0.26%.
Underlying EBITDA decreased by £13.1m,  
or 17%, to £62.3m in the year ended 
31 December 2015 (2014: £75.4m). 
Excluding the impact of the SecureNet 
acquisition and the foreign currency 
translation impact, underlying EBITDA 
decreased by £14.4m, or 17%. Operating 
costs (excluding SecureNet and foreign 
currency translation) increased by £16.5m, 
reflecting increased costs payable to 
third-party sales agents and additional 
investment in people, security and office 
costs to deliver the strategy. In addition, 
bad debt provisions increased year-on-
year by £3.8m.
SecureNet, which was purchased in 
December 2014, contributed £9.7m to net 
revenue in the year (2014: £0.3m) and 
made a loss of £4.4m (2014: loss of £0.2m). 
Net revenue was significantly lower than 
expected due to slower than expected 
sign-up of new partners. To offset this 
shortfall, however, certain synergies were 
realised earlier than anticipated, primarily 
through a workforce reduction. As a result, 
overall performance was in line with our 
expectations.
The Directors believe strongly that we 
have the right strategy and people in place 
to deliver sustainable growth in the future 
but it will take longer than previously 
anticipated to achieve and we will incur 
additional costs as a result.

Shareholder information
 
The information presented and discussed 
in this section includes a number of 
measures that are not defined or 
recognised under IFRS including net 
revenue, underlying EBITDA, underlying 
pro forma earnings per share and free 
cash flow. These are considered to be key 
measures of the Group’s financial 
performance and as such have been 
included here to aid comparability and 
enhance usefulness. 
Net revenue, defined as revenue less 
interchange and scheme fees, is 
presented and discussed in this section as 
the Directors believe that this best reflects 
the relationship between revenue and 
profitability. Underlying EBITDA, being 
earnings before interest, tax, depreciation 
and amortisation, excluding separately 
disclosed items, is considered by the 
Directors to give a fairer view of the 
year-on-year comparison of underlying 
trading performance. Separately disclosed 
items are costs or income that have been 
recognised in the income statement 
which the Directors believe, due to their 
nature or size, should be disclosed 
separately to give a more comparable view 
of the year-on-year underlying financial 
performance. These are explained further 
later in this section.
Underlying pro forma earnings per share is 
calculated by taking profit/loss for the 
period before separately disclosed items, 
divided by the number of shares in issue at 
the end of 2015. Free cash flow represents 
the Group’s net cash inflow from operating 
activities, after accounting for the Group’s 
net capital expenditure and underlying 
finance costs. It excludes any working 
capital movements associated with the 
IPO. The Directors believe that free cash 
flow provides a better reflection of the 
cash being generated by the business. 
On 3 July 2015, in contemplation of the 
IPO, the Company changed its financial 
year end from 30 November to 
31 December. As a result, the statutory 
comparative period to the 2015 financial 
statements is the one month to 
31 December 2014. To aid comparability 
and understanding of performance, 
however, we have presented pro forma 
comparative information for the 12 months 
to 31 December 2014 in this section. The 
statutory one-month comparative 
information can be found in the Financial 
statements section of this Report.
Revenue
Revenue in the year of £3,963.0m (2014: 
£3,626.6m) was £336.4m, or 9%, higher than 
in the prior year. Excluding the impact of 
acquisitions during the current and prior 
period (SecureNet and Cobre Bem) and the 
foreign currency translation impact on our 
WPUS revenue, growth was 5%. This growth 
reflects a 23% increase in our Global eCom 
business and a 6% increase in WPUS, partly 
offset by an 8% reduction in WPUK.

Worldpay Group plc
Annual Report and Accounts 2015
The increase in Global eCom reflects 
strong volume growth across all verticals, 
particularly in acquiring, treasury 
management and foreign exchange 
services and gateway income. The decline 
in WPUK reflects the impact on customers 
of reductions in cross-border acquired 
interchange costs in January 2015 and Visa 
and MasterCard repricing in 2015. The 6% 
underlying growth in WPUS was driven 
principally by growth in acquiring income, 
reflecting an increase in transaction volumes.
SecureNet contributed £31.5m (2014: 
£1.0m) to revenue in the year and Cobre 
Bem contributed £1.4m (2014: £nil). The 
foreign exchange impact on translation of 
our WPUS results accounted for £127.1m of 
revenue growth year-on-year.
Net revenue
Net revenue increased by £118.3m, or 14% 
year-on-year, to £981.7m (2014: £863.4m). 
Excluding the impact of acquisitions and 
foreign currency translation on our WPUS 
revenue, growth was 10%. This growth 
reflects a 16% increase in our Global eCom 
business, an 11% increase in WPUK and a 
3% increase in WPUS. 
The increase in Global eCom reflects the 
same factors as for revenue above. In 
WPUK, an increase in transaction volumes 
and net acquiring income accounted for 
the majority of the increase. In WPUS, the 
6% growth in revenue was partly offset by 
higher interchange and scheme fees.
SecureNet contributed £9.7m (2014: £0.3m) 
to net revenue in the year and Cobre Bem 
contributed £1.3m (2014: £nil). The foreign 
exchange impact on translation of our 
WPUS results accounted for £17 .0m of net 
revenue growth year-on-year.
Further details on the segmental 
breakdown of net revenue performance  
is provided in the Operating review.
Gross profit
Gross profit increased by £95.1m, or 12% 
year-on-year, to £860.4m (2014: £765.3m). 
Excluding the impact of acquisitions and 
foreign currency translation on our WPUS 
gross profit, growth was 10%. This reflects 
an 18% increase in our Global eCom 
business, an 8% increase in WPUK and a 
1% increase in WPUS. 
The increase in Global eCom was driven 
from the revenue improvements noted 
above. In WPUK and WPUS, increased 
referral commission payments to partners 
reduced the underlying gross profit 
growth. 
Underlying personnel and net 
operating expenses
Underlying personnel and net operating 
expenses increased by £63.7m, or 16% 
year-on-year, to £454.3m (2014: £390.6m). 
Excluding the impact of acquisitions and 
foreign currency translation on our WPUS 
expenses, the increase was 11%. 
The increase year-on-year reflects higher 
wages and salaries due to a higher average 
number of employees, as well as other 
operating costs associated with supporting 
the growth in revenue, including the costs 
of organisational investments made in 2014. 
In addition, bad debt expenses increased by 
£6.3m, to £22.5m, in the year.
The average number of employees 
increased to 4,982 from 4,518 in the prior 
year. The increase was principally driven by 
recruitment of personnel to enhance 
capabilities in sales, marketing and lead 
generation, product development, product 
management and data analytics.
Underlying personnel and net operating 
expenses in SecureNet amounted to 
£10.7m (2014: £0.4m) in the year with costs 
in Cobre Bem amounting to £2.8m (2014: 
£0.5m). The foreign exchange impact on 
translation of our WPUS results accounted 
for an increase of £7.9m year-on-year.
Underlying EBITDA
Underlying EBITDA increased by £31.4m,  
or 8% year-on-year, to £406.1m (2014: 
£374.7m). Excluding the impact of 
acquisitions and foreign currency 
translation on our WPUS EBITDA, the 
growth was 8%. This reflects an increase 
in net revenue for the Group of 10%, partly 
offset by higher third-party commission 
expenses and higher underlying 
personnel and net operating costs as 
we continue to invest in organisational 
capability to support future growth. 
The underlying EBITDA growth of 8% 
reflected a 15% increase in Global eCom 
and WPUK, partly offset by a 17% decline 
in WPUS and a 7% increase in Corporate 
costs. 
SecureNet reported a loss at the 
underlying EBITDA level of £4.4m (2014: 
loss of £0.2m) and Cobre Bem reported 
a loss of £1.5m (2014: loss of £0.5m). The 
foreign exchange impact on translation 
of our WPUS results accounted for 
£5.4m of underlying EBITDA growth 
year-on-year. 
Further details on the segmental 
breakdown of underlying EBITDA 
performance is provided in the Operating 
review.
Underlying depreciation and amortisation
Underlying depreciation and amortisation 
decreased by £12.8m, or 16% year-on-year, 
to £65.6m (2014: £78.4m). The decrease 
largely reflects lower charges in 2015 on 
items of software, computer equipment 
and terminals that existed at the time of 
the divestment from RBS and that had 
been fully depreciated at the end of 2014. 
While additions to computer software 
have increased during the year, this 
includes intangible assets under the 
course of construction relating to our new 
technology platform which are not being 
amortised as they are not yet available for 
use. At 31 December 2015, the total value 
relating to intangible assets under the 
course of construction amounted to 
£235.3m, compared with £145.1m at 
31 December 2014. We expect that, as 
these assets become available for use, 
this will lead to a substantial increase in 
the underlying depreciation and 
amortisation charge. Once in use, these 
assets will be depreciated over 10 years.
Underlying finance costs
Underlying finance costs decreased by 
£12.0m, or 7%, year-on-year to £151.2m (2014: 
£163.2m). The decrease reflects the 
reduction in borrowings following the IPO, 
whereby the overall debt fell by £833m and, 
as a result of the refinancing, the average 
cost of debt fell from an average of 5.7% in 
2014 to 3.1%. The Directors expect underlying 
finance costs to fall substantially in 2016 as 
we see a full year benefit from the change in 
capital structure.

Shareholder information
 
Share of results of joint venture 
and associate
The share of results of joint venture and 
associate was a loss of £1.2m (2014: loss of 
£0.3m) and reflects our investments in 
Pazien Inc. and SPay, Inc. 
On 15 May 2015, the Group purchased 499 
Class A shares in SPay, a referral company 
specialising in the sport sector, 
representing a 49.9% shareholding 
based on the shares in issue at that date. 
On 18 December, SPay issued further 
shares to another investor, reducing 
Worldpay’s shareholding to 25%. 
On 4 June 2015, the Group purchased a 
further 65,402 shares in Pazien Inc., an 
innovative start-up company creating 
products using transaction data to enable 
more intelligent routing, automated 
optimisation and reconciliation for our 
Global eCom merchants. Although the 
Group holds 51% of shares in Pazien Inc., it 
does not represent control over the entity 
as the Board is shared equally between the 
Group and the founders of the business.
Separately disclosed items
Separately disclosed items in the year 
amounted to a pre-tax net cost of £169.0m 
(2014: £179.9m), of which £103.7m (2014: 
£88.6m) affected EBITDA, £69.9m (2014: 
£82.7m) affected depreciation and 
amortisation and a net gain of £4.6m (2014: 
cost of £8.6m) affected finance costs. 
Separately disclosed items are costs or 
profits that have been recognised in the 
year which the Directors believe, due to 
their nature or size, should be disclosed 
separately to give a more comparable view 
of the year-on-year underlying financial 
performance.
The separately disclosed items affecting 
EBITDA comprise platform-related and 
other costs incurred in the separation 
from RBS; non-capitalisable costs of the 
IPO; reorganisation and restructuring 
costs; and other costs. 
Platform-related separation costs of 
£33.3m (2014: £35.1m) are non-capitalised 
costs associated with the upgrade and 
migration of the Group’s core systems 
from RBS. They are principally personnel, 
maintenance and consultancy costs. Total 
costs incurred to date on the platform 
programme are £449.8m (2014: £361.9m), 
of which £289.4m (2014: £234.8m) has been 
included within tangible and intangible 
assets on the balance sheet, with the 
remainder charged directly to the income 
statement.
Other costs related to the separation from 
RBS of £20.1m (2014: £24.1m) principally 
relate to system implementation and 
remediation, double running of property, 
and the excess costs of interim staff.
In 2016, we expect a further reduction in 
platform-related and other costs incurred 
in the separation from RBS as the 
programme nears completion.
The non-capitalisable costs of the IPO in 
the year amounted to £35.0m (2014: £nil) 
and reflect the costs of various share 
awards granted as part of the IPO, including 
the all-employee free share award and 
additional awards given to management.
Reorganisation and restructuring costs 
of £6.4m (2014: £18.2m) represent costs 
associated with a variety of projects to 
develop and implement the strategy of 
establishing Worldpay as a stand-alone 
business. Costs in 2015 include the 
restructuring and further integration of 
the Cardsave business in WPUK and the 
sales force reorganisation in WPUS.

These are partially offset by the release of 
provisions for contingent consideration 
payable on acquisitions no longer required.
Other costs of £8.9m (2014: £11.2m) include 
fees payable to shareholders incurred 
prior to the IPO in relation to the previous 
ownership structure and a number of 
other smaller one-off items.
Separately disclosed items affecting 
depreciation and amortisation amounted 
to £69.9m (2014: £82.7m). These 
predominantly relate to the amortisation of 
business combination intangibles which is 
a non-cash charge relating to intangible 
assets recognised on the divestment of the 
business from RBS, as well as subsequent 
strategic business acquisitions. In addition, 
in the year, software development in WPUS 
of £2.0m was deemed to be impaired and 
written-off following the integration of the 
SecureNet business.
Separately disclosed items affecting 
finance costs in the year were a net  
gain of £4.6m (2014: cost of £8.6m) and 
comprise costs associated with the 
refinancing of the Group (£44.7m), a net 
revaluation gain on fair value of the Visa 
Europe shares and related Contingent 
Value Rights (£54.8m), and FX losses 
resulting from the translation of the 
Group’s assets and liabilities denominated 
in currencies other than Sterling (£5.5m). 
The £44.7m of costs associated with the 
refinancing represent the write-off of 
previously capitalised finance costs on 
repayment of the debt that was in place 
prior to the IPO. The net revaluation gain 
on the Visa Europe shares and related 
Contingent Value Rights is explained in 
more detail on page 76.
We expect most separately disclosed 
items to be eliminated from the end of 
2016, with the exception of the non-cash 
charge for amortisation of business 
combination intangibles, a charge for 
residual migration activity and the charge 
for the transitional share award plan, 
awarded at IPO, which will cease part-way 
through 2018.
Profit/(loss) before tax
The profit before tax for the year was £19.1m 
(2014: loss of £47 .1m). The improvement 
year-on-year reflects strong trading 
performance, together with a reduction in 
underlying depreciation and amortisation 
and underlying finance costs and the net 
gain in relation to the Visa Europe shares.
Tax
The tax charge on underlying results for 
the Group increased by £8.6m, or 21%, to a 
charge of £49.7m in the year ended 
31 December 2015 (2014: £41.1m), 
representing both current tax and 
deferred tax charges. The underlying tax 
charge was driven principally by taxable 
profits arising in the UK and the 
Netherlands, partly offset by taxable 
losses in the United States. 
The charge reflects an effective tax rate on 
underlying results of 26%, which is higher 
than the UK headline rate for the year of 
20.25% primarily due to higher overseas tax 
rates and non-deductible financing costs.
The tax credit of £0.8m (2014: £38.2m) 
arising on separately disclosed items 
includes a deferred tax charge of £39.2m 
arising on the proposed disposal of the 
interest in Visa Europe in 2016.
After including separately disclosed items, 
the Group’s total tax charge increased by 
£46.0m to £48.9m in the year ended 
31 December 2015 (2014: £2.9m), inclusive 
of the Visa Europe deferred tax liability 
referred to above.
Earnings per share and dividends
Basic and diluted underlying pro forma 
earnings per share in the year was 6.9p, 
an increase of 50% on the pro forma prior 
year earnings per share. Underlying pro 
forma earnings per share is calculated 
by taking profit/loss before separately 
disclosed items, divided by the number of 
shares in issue at the end of 2015. The year 
end number of shares has been used as 
this avoids the distortion caused by the 
pre-IPO position and therefore aids 
comparability this year and in the 
following year.
On a reported basis, the basic and diluted 
loss per share for 2015 was 1.8p compared 
with a loss per share in the prior year of 3.1p.
In line with the guidance given at the time 
of the IPO, the Directors are not 
recommending the payment of a dividend 
in relation to the year ended 31 December 
2015. The Group’s first dividend as a public 
company is expected to be declared at the 
2016 half year results and paid in 
November 2016. The Group’s dividend 
policy is based on a pay-out ratio of 20% to 
30% of reported profit after tax per annum, 
with approximately one third of any annual 
dividend to be paid in respect of the first 
half and two thirds in respect of the 
second half.
Cash and liquidity
Cash flow
The net cash inflow from operations in the 
year increased by £80.1m, or 35%, to 
£312.1m (2014: £232.0m). The increase 
reflects improvements to underlying 
trading and working capital and lower tax 
payments, partly offset by increased 
separately disclosed items affecting 
EBITDA and higher foreign exchange 
losses. The working capital inflow in the 
year of £29.2m (2014: outflow of £30.5m) 
largely reflects an increase in trade 
payables and accruals as a result of the 
growth in the underlying business and 
investment in people and infrastructure. 
The corresponding growth in trade debtors 
we would expect to see was partly offset 
by the impact of reductions in interchange 
rates during the year, resulting in lower 
levels of customer funding. 
Expenditure on tangible fixed assets and 
software in the year was £179.0m (2014: 
£142.7m). The increase year-on-year 
reflects investment in a number of 
customer propositions to support the 
growth plans of our operating divisions; 
and spend to enhance our data security 
and improve our data analytics capability. 
These have been partially offset by lower 
investment in platform-related expenditure 
as we transition from the ‘build’ to the ‘test’ 
phase of this project. Total capital 
expenditure is expected to remain 
between 16% and 20% of net revenue in 
2016 and to decline to approximately 9% to 
10% of net revenue in 2017.

Underlying finance costs paid in the year 
were £100.7m (2014: £88.6m). The increase 
year-on-year reflects the phasing of 
interest repayments.
As a result of the above movements, free 
cash flow increased to £32.4m in 2015 
compared with £0.7m in 2014.
Expenditure on acquisitions in the year 
reflects payments in relation to the 
Cardsave earnout, settlement of deferred 
consideration for YesPay, and investments 
made in SPay and Pazien.
The underlying movement in borrowings 
of £59.1m outflow (2014: inflow of £94.4m) 
included the repayment, in the first half of 
2015, of £50.0m that had been drawn 
under the Group’s revolving credit facility 
in 2014.
The net impact of the IPO and refinancing 
in the year was an inflow of £37.7m (2014: 
£nil) and principally reflects the proceeds 
received on issue of shares and the 
inflows from the refinancing, offset by the 
amounts paid to previous shareholders 
and the repayment of pre-IPO debt. 
Debt and financing
On 16 October, as part of the IPO process, 
all existing borrowings were repaid and the 
Group arranged new borrowing facilities 
totalling £1.7bn. These new borrowings 
comprised a £600m three-year term 
facility (Term Facility 1); a £900m five-year 
term facility (Term Facility 2); and a £200m 
revolving credit facility. The rates of 
interest are LIBOR-based plus a margin 
dependent on leverage. The maximum 
margin for Term Facility 1 is 2.00% and for 
Term Facility 2 is 2.50%. 
On 10 November 2015, the Group issued 
€500m 3.75% senior unsecured notes due 
2022, the proceeds of which were used to 
reduce Term Facility 1. The issue extended 
the average term of the Group’s debt, 
diversified its funding sources and fixed 
the interest rate on this portion of debt.
Net debt at 31 December 2015 was 
£1,425.3m (2014: £2,254.1m). The reduction 
year-on-year reflects the IPO and the 
resultant refinancing activity.

Annual Report and Accounts 2015
Proposed disposal of interest in 
Visa Europe
On 2 November 2015, we announced the 
proposed disposal of our approximate 
5.9% interest in Visa Europe to Visa Inc. 
The disposal, which is expected to 
complete in Q2 2016, is a result of Visa 
Inc.’s agreement to purchase 100% of Visa 
Europe, subject to the satisfaction of 
certain conditions.
Under the terms of the disposal, Worldpay 
will receive a mixture of cash and non-
cash consideration currently estimated to 
be worth in aggregate up to €1.2bn. This is 
made up of up-front consideration of 
approximately €544m of cash and €375m 
of Series B Preferred Stock in Visa Inc. In 
addition, if the earnout pays out in full, 
Worldpay could receive in the region of 
€283m in earnout conditional upon 
achieving certain criteria relating to the 
incremental net revenue of Visa Europe 
during the earnout period. The up-front 
consideration will be reduced by any final 
settlement of potential liabilities relating 
to ongoing interchange related litigation 
involving Visa Europe. Potential losses 
from interchange litigation liabilities will be 
set against the Preferred Stock which can 
be reduced to absorb those losses. A Loss 
Sharing Agreement entered into by 
Worldpay, along with the ten other largest 
UK members of Visa Europe, provides a 
second level of protection to Visa Inc., 
capped at the value of the cash 
consideration received. The Group’s share 
of such liabilities arising from the UK 
interchange related litigation is capped at 
the Group’s up-front consideration. 
As set out in our IPO Prospectus dated 
13 October 2015, the holders of the 
contingent value rights (‘CVRs’) (a 
separate class of shares in the Company) 
will be entitled to 90% of the net post-tax 
proceeds of the disposal in accordance 
with the terms of the CVRs (subject to the 
Company’s right of retention), with 
Worldpay retaining 10% of the net 
proceeds. Further details of the CVRs are 
set out in our Prospectus.
Following the disposal, Worldpay will 
continue to be a participant in the Visa 
payments system. It is anticipated that 
Worldpay will no longer have 
representation on the Board of Visa 
Europe following completion of the 
disposal as a result of Visa Europe ceasing 
to be a member-owned association.
As at 30 June 2015 and on IPO completion, 
the Visa Europe asset was recognised in 
the Group’s balance sheet as a financial 
asset with a fair value of £nil. In 
accordance with IAS 39, financial assets 
should be re-measured at each reporting 
date. In performing the revaluation at 
31 December 2015, the offer by Visa Inc. to 
purchase Visa Europe has been taken into 
account in the subsequent measure of fair 
value, despite the fact that there remains 
some uncertainty around both the 
likelihood of completion of the deal (which 
is still subject to anti-trust clearance), and 
the amount of pre-transaction operational 
liabilities which would reduce the up-front 
consideration received.
The CVR liabilities were recognised at £nil 
fair value on initial recognition. At year 
end, they were re-measured at amortised 
cost based on a re-estimation of future 
cash flows, with any changes being 
recognised in the income statement.
Based on the above, the fair value of the 
Visa Europe asset on the Group’s balance 
sheet has increased to £195.7m and the 
corresponding CVR liabilities have been 
valued at £140.9m. A deferred tax liability 
of £39.2m has also been recognised. A net 
pre-tax revaluation gain of £54.8m has 
been recognised in finance costs as a 
separately disclosed item.

Chairman’s governance letter
Governance
Your Board, under my Chairmanship, has 
made a firm commitment to apply the 
highest standards of governance across 
the Group. The appropriate governance 
practices in place prior to the IPO in 
October 2015 have been strengthened 
with the structures and processes 
required of a publicly listed company and 
these will be enhanced during the course 
of 2016. Our first governance report 
explains our current arrangements and 
areas for further development in 2016.
The Board
The appointment of Deanna Oppenheimer 
on 1 January 2016 further strengthens our 
Board. She is a leading figure in 
international finance and, with her unusual 
combination of banking, retail, innovation, 
brand and communication skills, will be 
invaluable to Worldpay. Her appointment 
brings the number of Independent 
Non-Executive Directors to three. We 
recognise that the ratio of Independent 
Non-Executive Directors on the Board falls 
short of UK corporate governance and 
shareholder expectations and we will 
continue to build our new Board in 2016. In 
furtherance of this objective, we will have 
regard to our Board Appointments Policy, 
which provides for diversity across a range 
of measures, including skills, experience, 
knowledge and gender in order to meet 
the needs of our business. 
With new Independent Directors joining 
the Board, we will provide thorough 
induction and on-going education 
programmes in the form of a series of 
development and strategy support 
presentations for the entire Board at the 
end of each of its meetings. This series, 
together with our normal on-going 
business reviews, will ensure that the 
Non-Executive Directors build sufficient 
knowledge to be able to contribute fully 
to the Board’s review and development 
of strategy.
We recognise the benefit of a thorough 
Board effectiveness review and believe 
the time to do this will be around the 
anniversary of our IPO, towards the end 
of 2016.
Risk management and corporate culture
Our risk culture is centred on risk awareness, 
openness, continuous improvement and 
encouraging the right behaviour to ensure 
an appropriate outcome for both the 
Company and its customers. Our colleagues 
are required to consider risk in their decision 
making and take personal accountability for 
the risks they take. The distillation of a set of 
everyday working principles and behaviours 
into the Worldpay Way sets the tone from 
the top, which together with comprehensive 
development opportunities to drive our 
capabilities and specific training 
programmes to reinforce our legal and 
regulatory compliance, supports a positive 
corporate culture. 
Participation in these training 
programmes and the output from our 
annual colleague survey is regularly 
reviewed by the Executive Committee and 
the Board to ensure we maintain a positive 
culture across the organisation.
Engagement with our shareholders
We place great importance on active 
engagement with our shareholders and 
have put in place a programme of meetings 
to discuss our strategy and performance. In 
addition, we have also engaged with our 
major shareholders and a number of 
governance organisations in respect of our 
performance measures and targets for our 
bonus and long-term incentive 
arrangements, which are fully aligned with 
our targets and key performance indicators 
for the delivery of our strategy. 
We look forward to engaging with you in 
2016 and beyond and look forward to your 
support at our first annual general 
meeting on 10 May 2016.
Further details of our governance and 
remuneration arrangements are detailed 
on pages 82 to 112.

Annual Report and Accounts 2015
Corporate governance report
Compliance with the UK Corporate 
Governance Code
This report sets out how the Company 
applied the principles of the UK Corporate 
Governance Code (‘the Code’) and the 
extent to which the Company complied 
with the provisions of the Code in the 
period from 16 October 2015, being the 
date the Company’s shares were first 
listed on the primary market of the London 
Stock Exchange, to 31 December 2015. 
Prior to the Company’s shares being listed, 
the Code did not apply to the Company 
and although governance standards were 
high under private equity ownership there 
were certain areas of the Code, mainly in 
respect of the year end work of the Audit 
Committee, the Annual General Meeting 
and re-election of Directors that the 
Company did not comply with. Therefore, 
to ensure this report is more meaningful, 
we also set out the progress made in our 
governance arrangements up to the date 
of this report and our intentions for the 
balance of 2016. As at the date of this 
report, there were two areas of the Code 
with which we did not comply. The first of 
these is the balance of Independent 
Non-Executive Directors relative to other 
Directors on the Board (provision B.1 of the 
Code) and the second is in respect of the 
requirement to conduct an evaluation of 
the Board and its Committees (provision 
B.6 of the Code). Steps are being taken to 
address these areas with the objective of 
being fully compliant during the course of 
2016. Further explanations around our 
intentions are given in the relevant part of 
this report.
The Group’s business model and strategy
The Group’s business model and strategy 
are summarised on pages 24 to 51 of this 
Report.
Responsibilities of the Board of Directors
The Board is responsible for the long-term 
success of the Group and for ensuring that 
there is a framework of prudent and 
effective controls, which enables risk to be 
assessed and managed. The Board sets 
the Company’s strategic aims, ensures 
that the necessary financial and human 
resources are in place for the Company to 
meet its objectives and reviews 
management performance. The Board 
also sets the Company’s values and 
standards and ensures that its obligations 
to its shareholders and others are 
understood and met.
The Board has a schedule of matters 
reserved for its approval and has a formal 
structure of delegated authority, whereby 
specified aspects of management and 
control of the Group have been delegated 
to the Board Committees, the Executive 
Directors, the Group Executive Committee 
and the operating division management 
teams. The Board has agreed the terms of 
reference for the Audit, Risk, Nomination 
and Remuneration Committees and the 
role and responsibilities documents for 
the Chairman and the Chief Executive 
Officer, all of which can be found on 
the Group’s corporate website at 
http://investors.worldpay.com. The 
powers of the Directors are set out in 
the Company’s Articles of Association.

Board activity during the period
At each Board meeting, the Chief 
Executive Officer presents a 
comprehensive update on the strategy 
and trading performance across the 
Group and the Chief Financial Officer 
presents a detailed analysis of the 
financial performance, both at Group and 
operating division level. In view of their 
critical importance to the business of the 
Group, the Board reviews progress on the 
new payments platform and cyber 
security at each of its meetings. This is in 
addition to the regular review by the Audit 
Committee of in-depth assurance work in 
respect of those two areas. Senior 
executives below Board level attend 
relevant parts of Board and Committee 
meetings in order to make presentations 
on their areas of responsibility. This gives 
the Board access to a broader group of 
executives and helps the Directors make 
assessments when considering the 
Group’s succession plans. The Board 
continually reviews the Group’s strategy 
at each of its meetings and, in addition, 
holds one dedicated strategy meeting 
each year.

Worldpay Group plc
Annual Report and Accounts 2015
Board and Committee membership, 
appointments and diversity
Following the IPO, Advent and Bain 
continue to be significant shareholders 
in the Company and are each entitled to 
appoint one Non-Executive Director to 
the Board for as long as they (together 
with their respective associates as 
applicable) are entitled to exercise control, 
directly or indirectly, over the exercise of 
10% or more of the votes able to be cast on 
all or substantially all matters at general 
meetings of the Company. The first such 
appointees are James Brocklebank in 
respect of Advent and Robin Marshall 
in respect of Bain. 
The Board is mindful of the need to also 
consider the interests of the Company’s 
new investors. Prior to the IPO, the 
Board appointed Sir Michael Rake as 
Non-Executive Chairman and John Allan 
and Martin Scicluna as Independent 
Non-Executive Directors. On 1 January 
2016, Deanna Oppenheimer was 
appointed to the Board as an Independent 
Non-Executive Director. Excluding the 
Chairman, the current ratio of 
Independent Non-Executive Directors to 
other Directors is 3:5, which falls short of 
the Code requirement that, excluding the 
Chairman, at least half of the Board should 
comprise Independent Non-Executive 
Directors. The Board will continue to 
review its composition and intends to 
comply fully with the requirements of the 
Code by the end of the current financial 
year. Until that objective is achieved, 
the Board believes that its current 
composition and the composition of its 
Committees will provide the appropriate 
corporate governance balance in light 
of the interests of Bain, Advent and 
other shareholders.
Board composition
As at 8 March 2016, the Board 
comprised the Non-Executive Chairman 
(who was independent on appointment 
in September 2015), three Executive 
Directors, three Independent Non-
Executive Directors and two Non-
Executive Directors. Biographical details 
of all Directors can be found on pages 78 
to 81 and on the Group’s corporate website 
at http://investors.worldpay.com.
The Chairman
Sir Michael Rake was the Chairman 
throughout the period from the IPO 
to the date of this Report. 
The roles of the Chairman and Chief 
Executive Officer are separate and 
distinct. There are Board-approved 
Roles and Responsibilities documents for 
both positions, which clearly set out in 
writing their respective responsibilities. 
These documents can be found on 
the Group’s corporate website at 
http://investors.worldpay.com. 
The Senior Independent Director
Martin Scicluna was the Senior 
Independent Director throughout the 
period from the IPO to the date of this 
Report. The Senior Independent Director 
is available to shareholders should they 
have concerns that cannot be resolved 
through the normal channels involving 
the Executive Directors or the Chairman. 
The Board-approved Role and 
Responsibilities of the Senior Independent 
Director are set out in writing and can be 
found on the Group’s corporate website 
at http://investors.worldpay.com. 
The composition of the Board’s 
Committees will be further strengthened 
upon the appointment of each new 
Independent Non-Executive Director. 
Deanna Oppenheimer was appointed 
Chair of the Risk Committee at the same 
time as her appointment to the Board on 
1 January 2016 and was appointed as a 
member of the Remuneration Committee 
on 29 January 2016. Sir Michael Rake was a 
member of the Remuneration Committee 
in the period between the IPO and 
29 January 2016. Sir Michael Rake is also 
a member of the Audit Committee, but 
will step down from that Committee at 
such time as is appropriate.
The current compositions of the Board’s 
Committees are shown in the relevant 
Committee sections on pages 87 to 93.
The search, selection and appointment 
process for Non-Executive Directors is fully 
described in the section on the Nomination 
Committee on page 92.
When appointing new Independent 
Non-Executive Directors, the Board will 
have regard to its Board Appointments 
Policy, which provides for diversity across 
a range of measures, including skills, 
experience and gender in order to meet 
the needs of the business. The Board 
Appointments Policy can be found at 
http://investors.worldpay.com.
Directors’ conflicts of interest
The Companies Act has codified the 
Directors’ duty to avoid a situation in 
which they have, or can have, an interest 
that conflicts, or possibly may conflict, 
with the interests of the Company. A 
Director will not be in breach of that duty 
if  the relevant matter has been authorised 
in accordance with the Articles of 
Association by the other Directors.
Corporate governance report

Worldpay Group plc
Annual Report and Accounts 2015
Overview
Strategic report
Directors’ report 
Financial statements
Shareholder information
 
The Board has established a process to 
identify and authorise conflicts. As part of 
that process, it has also agreed that the 
Nomination Committee should review the 
authorised conflicts every six months or 
more frequently if a new potential conflict 
arises for an existing Director. The 
Nomination Committee reviews the 
interests of candidates prior to making 
recommendations for the appointment 
of new Directors. The Nomination 
Committee and Board applied the above 
principles and process throughout the 
period to the date of this report and 
confirm that these have operated 
effectively.
Confirmation of Director independence
At its March 2016 Board meeting, as 
part of a thorough review of corporate 
governance against the Code, the Board 
considered the independence of the 
Non-Executive Directors against the 
criteria specified in the Code and 
determined that John Allan, Martin 
Scicluna and Deanna Oppenheimer 
were independent.
In reaching the above determination of 
independence, the Board considered the 
following:
  That John Allan and Deanna 
Oppenheimer currently hold the 
positions of Chairman and Independent 
Non-Executive Director at Tesco plc; 
and
  The payments made prior to the IPO by 
AB JV Global S.à r.l (the then ultimate 
parent company of the Company) to 
John Allan and Martin Scicluna, which 
were disclosed fully in the IPO 
Prospectus and in the Remuneration 
report on page 106 of this Annual 
Report and Accounts.
The Board agreed that each of John Allan, 
Deanna Oppenheimer and Martin 
Scicluna are independent in character and 
judgement and the above matters have 
not restricted or impaired his or her 
effectiveness and independence.
Re-appointment of Directors
In accordance with the Code and the 
Company’s Articles of Association, all 
Directors are subject to election by 
shareholders. The Board has agreed that 
the Directors will be subject to annual 
election. Non-Executive Directors are 
initially appointed for a three-year term 
and, subject to review by the Nomination 
Committee and continued annual 
election by shareholders, can serve 
up to a maximum of three such terms. 
Board induction and development
An induction programme tailored to 
meet the needs of individual Directors is 
provided for each new Director. Overall, 
the aim of the induction programme is 
to introduce new Directors to the 
Group’s business, its operations and 
its governance arrangements.
Such inductions typically include 
meetings with senior management, both 
at the Group level and within the operating 
divisions, where they receive a thorough 
briefing on the business and meet with the 
management teams. Individual induction 
requirements are monitored by the 
Chairman, with the support of the Group 
Company Secretary, to ensure that 
newly appointed Directors gain sufficient 
knowledge about the Group to enable 
them to contribute to the Board’s 
deliberations as swiftly as possible. 
The induction content and process will 
evolve as we build on the experience of 
inducting each new Director. 
In order to fully support the Directors 
and to ensure they have a high level of 
knowledge about the Group’s businesses 
and our strategy, a series of development 
and strategy support presentations will 
be given to the Board after each of its 
meetings. This programme, in addition to 
the normal business reviews, will ensure 
that all members of the Board have 
sufficient and equal knowledge to be able 
to contribute fully to the Board’s review 
and development of strategy.
At regular Board meetings and, where 
appropriate, Committee meetings, the 
Directors receive updates and presentations 
on business developments. In addition to 
gaining a better understanding of those 
businesses, these programmes also 
increase the exposure of senior talent to 
the Board and give the Board presence 
across the Group.
Operation of the Board and 
its Committees
Prior to each Board meeting, the 
Chairman meets with the Independent 
Non-Executive Directors in the absence 
of the other Non-Executive Directors 
and the Executive Directors.
The Directors have access to a fully 
encrypted electronic portal system, 
which enables them to receive and  
review Board and Committee papers 
quickly and securely using electronic 
tablets. Scheduled Board and Committee 
meetings are held physically and most 
ad-hoc meetings are held by phone. 
The Group Company Secretary attends 
all Board meetings.
The papers in respect of the Audit, Risk, 
Nomination and Remuneration 
Committees are circulated to all the 
Non-Executive Directors, regardless of 
Committee membership. Major decisions 
taken under the Group’s Delegation of 
Authority are reported to the next 
Board meeting. 86

Annual Report and Accounts 2015
Board evaluation
In view of the short period of time between 
the IPO and the date of this Report, the 
Board has not yet conducted an evaluation 
of its effectiveness. However, the Board 
recognises the benefit of a thorough Board 
and Committee evaluation process, and 
believes the time to do this will be around 
the first anniversary of the IPO, towards the 
end of 2016. The output from that review 
will be discussed by the Board and the 
actions arising, which will be monitored 
by the Chairman, will be disclosed in the 
2016 Annual Report and Accounts.
Separately, the Non-Executive Directors, 
under the leadership of the Senior 
Independent Director and with input 
from the Executive Directors, will 
conduct an evaluation of the Chairman. 
The Group’s performance management 
system applies to management at all 
levels. The individual performance of the 
Executive Directors is reviewed separately 
by the Chairman and the Remuneration 
Committee. Further details of the 
Executive Directors’ performance 
measures and objectives are given in 
the Remuneration report on pages 97  
and 109.
Board meetings and attendance
The Board and its Committees have regular 
scheduled meetings throughout the year 
and supplementary meetings are held as 
and when necessary. The table below 
shows the number of scheduled Board 
and Committee meetings attended by 
each Director out of the number convened 
during the time served by each Director 
on the Board or relevant Committee during 
the period. Non-attendance at Board and 
Committee meetings was due to: in the 
case of Rick Medlock, a commitment 
made prior to joining the Board; and in 
the cases of Sir Michael Rake and James 
Brocklebank, unavoidable business 
commitments. In each case, the Director 
gave input to the Chairman of the meeting 
on the business to be conducted prior to 
the meeting. Each of the Directors has 
given a firm commitment to being able to 
give sufficient time to enable them to fulfil 
their duties, including the attendance of 
meetings, in 2016.
As well as the scheduled meetings, the 
Directors attended additional Board and 
Committee meetings. These were mainly 
in respect of the IPO of the Company and 
other strategic matters that the Chairman 
and Chief Executive Officer decided 
should be considered by the Board prior 
to the next scheduled meeting. Despite 
these meetings being held at relatively 
short notice, there was full attendance 
at each of these additional meetings.

Composition of the Committee
Martin Scicluna, John Allan and Sir 
Michael Rake were appointed to the 
Committee prior to the IPO. The Chairman 
of the Company being a member of the 
Committee is permitted by the Code 
(provision C.3.1) because he was 
independent on appointment as 
Chairman. However, Sir Michael Rake 
intends to step down as a member of  
the Committee when an additional 
Independent Non-Executive Director  
is appointed to the Board and the 
Committee.
Role of the Committee
The Board has delegated to the 
Committee responsibility for overseeing 
the financial reporting, internal and 
external audit and controls, reviewing the 
scope of the annual audit and non-audit 
work undertaken by external auditors and 
for making recommendations to the Board 
in relation to the appointment of the 
Company’s internal and external auditors.
In accordance with its terms of reference, 
the Committee, which reports its findings 
to the Board, is authorised to:
  Monitor the integrity of the financial 
statements including annual and 
half-year results and any Group trading 
or interim statements, including a review 
of the significant financial reporting 
judgements contained in them;
  Review the content of the Annual Report 
and advise the Board on whether it is 
fair, balanced and understandable;
 Review the Company’s internal financial  
 controls and the Group’s internal   
 control and risk management systems;
   Review and assess the annual Group 
Internal Audit Plan;
  Monitor and review the effectiveness of 
the Company’s internal audit function;
  Establish and oversee the Company’s 
relationship with its external auditor, 
including the monitoring of their 
independence, and the approval of 
the external auditors’ remuneration 
and terms of engagement; 
  Review and approve the annual 
external audit plan; and 
   Assess the effectiveness of the 
external audit process.
The Committee has a forward work 
programme to ensure that it will meet its 
responsibilities in the current financial 
year. To enable it to carry out its duties and 
responsibilities effectively, the Committee 
relies on information and support from 
management across the business. The full 
terms of reference of the Committee are 
available at http://investors.worldpay.com 
or from the Group Company Secretary at 
the Company’s registered office. 
Principal activities of the Audit 
Committee during the period
In the period from the date of the IPO in 
October 2015 to the date of this report, 
the Committee reviewed the following:
Financial
  The 2015 full year results (including 
accounting issues and judgements) 
and the processes underpinning 
their preparation;
  Information in support of the 
statements in relation to going concern, 
longer-term viability, fair, balanced and 
understandable, and disclosure of 
information to the auditors. 
External audit
   The annual audit plan and scope;
  The auditor’s year-end report.
*  Martin Scicluna and Sir Michael Rake are considered 
by the Board to have recent and relevant financial 
experience, as required by the Code.
The Audit Committee’s 
focus is on the integrity of 
our financial statements, 
the effectiveness of 
financial and internal 
controls and the assurance 
provided by the Internal 
Audit function as our 
third line of defence.

Internal Auditor has the authority of the 
Committee and executive management to 
restructure and enhance the skills of the 
Internal Audit function in order to enhance 
the quality of assurance work provided 
to the Group.
Integrity of the results announcements
Within its terms of reference, the Committee 
is authorised to monitor the integrity of the 
annual and half-year results, including a 
review of the significant judgements 
contained in them. At its meetings prior to 
the IPO and in December 2015 and January 
and March 2016, the Committee reviewed 
a number of papers prepared by the Group 
Financial Controller which set out the critical 
accounting judgements applied to the 
half year and full year accounts and other 
significant accounting matters such as 
quality of earnings, going concern, longer- 
term viability and confirmation that the 
Group’s accounting policies were 
appropriate and unchanged. It also gave 
consideration to a number of key disclosure 
considerations post-IPO and the impact of 
new accounting developments. 
At each of the meetings, the Audit 
Committee also reviewed papers prepared 
by the external auditor, which included 
their view on significant and judgemental 
reporting and accounting matters. 
The Committee pays particular attention 
to matters that it considers to be 
important by virtue of their impact on the 
Group results and remuneration of senior 
management, or the level of complexity, 
judgement or estimation in their 
application in preparation of the Group’s 
financial statements. The significant 
issues considered by the Audit Committee 
during the year are shown opposite.
External auditors
On 19 September 2012, KPMG were 
appointed as the auditors to the 
Worldpay Group and Michael Harper, 
a Partner of KPMG, was appointed 
Senior Statutory Auditor. 
A policy is in place which requires all 
material non-audit work proposed to 
be carried out by the external auditors to 
be pre-authorised by the Chief Financial 
Officer and/or the Committee in order 
to ensure that the provision of non-audit 
services does not impair the external 
auditors’ independence or objectivity. 
The policy is published on the Group’s 
corporate website at  
http://investors.worldpay.com.
An analysis of the fees earned by the 
Group’s auditors for audit and non-audit 
services is disclosed in Note 2e to the 
financial statements. Of the £4.2m total 
fee payable to KPMG in 2015, £3.2m 
was paid in respect of the work they 
conducted in connection with the 
Company’s IPO in October 2015 (£0.5m 
in respect of the audit of the Group’s 
historic information and £2.7m in respect 
of non-audit services as Reporting 
Accountant in connection with the IPO). 
The auditors were determined to be the 
appropriate advisors for the Group to 
engage, given the scale and complexity 
of the work involved. This work did 
not represent a threat to KPMG’s 
independence, as it was permissible work 
under auditor independence guidelines; 
was performed by a different and 
independent engagement team; did not 
give rise to financial entries; did not 
result in decisions being made by KPMG 
on behalf of management; and the fee 
arrangements were not dependent on the 
results of the work. KPMG also complied 
with the independence requirements as 
set out by the APB Ethical Standards for 
Reporting Accountants. The IPO-related 
audit and non-audit fees payable to 
KPMG are not expected to recur in 2016.
KPMG have confirmed their independence 
as auditors of the Company in a letter 
addressed to the Directors.
At its meeting in March 2016, the Audit 
Committee reviewed the effectiveness of 
the external audit process. This included 
reviewing comprehensive papers from 
both management and the external 
auditors, which set out the planning and 
execution of the conduct of the audit. 
The Audit Committee also held a meeting 
with the external auditors in the absence 
of management to discuss further. 
Upon the recommendation of the Audit 
Committee, KPMG will be proposed for 
re-election by shareholders at the AGM 
to be held on 10 May 2016. In reaching its 
decision to propose KPMG for re-election, 
the Audit Committee took into account 
the effectiveness of the external audit 
process, and the objectivity and 
independence and the length of tenure 
of KPMG as external auditors.

Overview
Strategic report
Directors’ report

Shareholder information
 
Significant issues considered by the Audit Committee during the year
Significant issue considered by the Committee How the issue was addressed by the Committee
Going concern: Management reviewed the appropriateness of 
preparing the Group financial statements for the half year and 
full year on a going concern basis and presented papers to the 
Committee in August 2015 and March 2016.
The Committee considered papers prepared by management and, 
taking into account the key assumptions and risks and the external 
auditors’ review of these papers, concluded that management’s 
recommendation to prepare accounts on a going concern basis 
was appropriate.
The Group’s accounting policies and application of them: Each 
year, the Group Accounting Policies Committee conducts a 
review of the Group’s accounting policies to ensure they remain 
appropriate. The findings from this review were presented to 
the Audit Committee in December 2015 as part of the Financial 
Controller update.
Having considered the paper, the Committee agreed with 
management’s proposals.
Presentation of financial information: During the year, 
management proposed a number of changes to the 
presentation of financial information including the introduction 
of ‘net revenue’ (being total revenue less interchange and 
scheme fees) on the face of the income statement.
The Committee considered management’s proposals and agreed to 
adopt them. Net revenue was introduced as it was felt that it 
enables a simpler discussion of the relationship between revenue 
and profitability following recent changes in regulation around 
interchange and scheme fees.
Accounting for the IPO, share issues and refinancing: The 
IPO process gave rise to a number of judgemental and complex 
accounting issues which were brought to the attention of the 
Audit Committee through papers presented by management. 
These included accounting for the IPO transaction costs, 
accounting for the transitional and all-employee share awards, 
and net investment hedging considerations. 
The Committee reviewed the papers prepared by the Group 
Financial Controller in which these issues were raised and after due 
discussion agreed with management’s approach.
Valuation of Visa Europe membership shares and related CVR 
liabilities: As at 30 June 2015 and on IPO completion, the Visa 
Europe asset was recognised in the Group’s balance sheet as a 
FVTPL financial asset with a fair value of £nil. The CVR liabilities 
were recognised at £nil fair value on initial recognition. 
Following the announcement in November 2015 of Visa Inc.’s 
intention to purchase Visa Europe, the financial assets and 
related liabilities were revalued to fair value through the income 
statement. Management prepared and presented several 
papers to the Committee which discussed the initial 
recognition of the Visa Europe asset and related CVR liabilities, 
and the subsequent revaluation. Audit procedures performed 
by KPMG and reported to the Committee included an 
assessment of the facts and circumstances and rights and 
obligations attached to the Visa Europe asset and CVR 
liabilities; a review of the key input assumptions within the 
valuation model; and a review of the adequacy of the Group’s 
disclosures in respect of the fair value hierarchy and 
sensitivities.
The Committee considered the papers prepared by management 
covering the initial recognition and subsequent revaluation. 
Following detailed discussions with management and with 
the external auditor who also provided critical challenge and 
assessment of the key accounting judgements, the Committee 
endorsed management’s proposals.
Separately disclosed items: The Group has an established 
policy of separately disclosing items that it believes, due to 
their size or nature, are not the result of normal operating 
performance and should be disclosed separately to allow a 
more comparable view of underlying trading performance.
The Committee considered management’s presentation of 
separately disclosed items, in particular items relating to the 
revaluation of the Visa Europe asset and related CVR liabilities,  
and the costs associated with the IPO and refinancing.

Significant issues considered by the Audit Committee during the year continued
Significant issue considered by the Committee How the issue was addressed by the Committee
Accuracy, cut-off and classification of revenue and settlement 
balances: The processing of payments, from which the Group 
generates the vast majority of its revenues, is dependent on 
highly complex IT systems with a number of different bases for 
calculating revenue and for settling funds. Audit procedures 
performed by KPMG and reported to the Committee included: 
testing the design, implementation and operating 
effectiveness of applicable controls; performing reconciliations 
of cash received to revenue recognised in the year; and 
obtaining third-party verification of settlement amounts. Where 
applicable, IT audit experts were also used throughout the 
audit process.
The Committee reviewed the strategy document presented by 
KPMG and agreed with the assessment of significant risks in 
relation to the audit. The Committee also reviewed the findings of 
the external auditor at both the half year and the year end in 
respect of the risk.
The Committee would review any changes in accounting policy, 
material unusual transactions or any other matters brought to their 
attention by management in respect of the risk (there were none 
during the current year). 
The controls and processes implemented by management 
are consistent with previous years and are considered to be 
appropriate by the Committee.
Considering all of the above, the Committee concluded that it was 
satisfied with the appropriateness of the reported numbers in the 
Annual Report.
Completeness of trade receivables impairment provisions: 
Provisions are made in respect of impairment of trade 
receivables where there is objective evidence that the Group 
cannot recover the original expected cash flows from the trade 
receivable due to events since the trade receivable was initially 
recognised, or where a merchant defaults or is expected to 
default on their obligation to deliver services for which the 
Group has already processed the corresponding payment 
transaction. The provisioning policy is reviewed annually by 
management to ensure it is still appropriate and bad debt 
provisions are discussed as part of the monthly management 
accounts review process. Material bad debts are reported to 
the Audit Committee. Audit procedures performed by KPMG 
and reported to the Committee included: assessment of the 
design and operating effectiveness of the key controls within 
the Group’s merchant onboarding and on-going monitoring 
processes; consideration of cash collection from merchants 
subsequent to the year-end; and a critical assessment of the 
output of the Group’s internal monitoring and review 
processes.
The Committee reviewed the strategy document presented by 
KPMG and agreed with the assessment of significant risks in 
relation to the audit. The Committee also reviewed the findings of 
the external auditor at both the half year and the year end in 
respect of the risk.
The Committee would review any changes in accounting policy, 
material unusual transactions or any other matters brought to their 
attention by management in respect of the risk (there were none

appropriate by the Committee.

Role of the Committee
The Board has delegated to the 
Committee responsibility for reviewing and 
proposing appointments to the Board and 
for recommending any other changes to the 
composition of the Board or its Committees. 
The principal responsibility of the 
Committee is to make recommendations

the Board, having regard for an appropriate 
balance of skills, knowledge, experience and 
diversity. The Committee ensures that there 
is clarity in respect of the role description 
and capabilities required for such

  Considered the Directors’ potential 
conflicts of interests.
Board Appointments Policy
Appointments to the Board are made on 
merit, against objective criteria and with

Policy recognises the benefits of diversity, 
including gender diversity and reinforces 
the Board’s principle that appointments 
are made on merit, in line with its current 
and future requirements, and reflect the 
UK listing and international activity of the 
Group. The appointments made prior to 
the IPO and up to the date of this report 
have been in line with that policy. 
The Board endorses the aims of the 
Davies’ report entitled 'Women on Boards'.

Management Committees
Group Executive Committee
The Chief Executive Officer leads the Group 
Executive Committee, which comprises the 
most senior business leaders and function 
heads. It is responsible for the day-to-day 
management of the Group and meets 
monthly to focus on a range of issues in 
relation to the strategic and operational 
development and performance of the 
businesses. The biographical details of 
the members of the Group Executive 
Committee are disclosed on pages 14 and 15.
Operating division management teams
The Group’s operating divisions (Global 
eCom, WPUK and WPUS) are managed 
by their respective Managing Directors 
and dedicated management teams. 
Management team meetings are held 
monthly to review strategic, operational 
and financial performance. These 
meetings are attended by members 
of the Executive Committee to ensure 
sufficient oversight and co-ordination 
on cross-Group developments.
Disclosure Committee
The Disclosure Committee is responsible 
for implementing and monitoring systems 
and controls in respect of the management 
of inside information and the disclosure 
of such information to the market in 
accordance with the Company’s obligations 
under the UK Listing Authority’s Disclosure 
and T ransparency Rules. The Committee 
meets to consider the Group’s disclosure 
obligations and to review all results 
announcements following certification 
from individual executives from across the 
Group. The Committee comprises the Chief 
Executive Officer, who is the Chairman, the 
Chief Financial Officer, the Group General 
Counsel, the Group Financial Controller, the 
Investor Relations Director and the Group 
Company Secretary.
Group Governance and 
Control Committee 
The Group has established this Committee 
to provide executive management with a 
forum to review risk on an enterprise wide 
basis and provides and escalation point for 
operating division risks. The Committee 
also reviews the activities of the Group’s 
assurance functions and operational risk 
profile and approves the annual 
Compliance Plan for review by the Risk 
Committee. The membership of this 
Committee includes executive 
management, the Chief Risk Officer, the 
Chief Internal Auditor, the Chief Information 
Security Officer, the Group Compliance 
Director and the Group Company 
Secretary. 
Culture and the Worldpay Way 
The distillation of a set of everyday 
working principles and behaviours into the 
Worldpay Way sets the tone from the top 
and supports a positive corporate culture. 
The Worldpay Way, which was developed 
and launched in 2015, is based on three 
core elements: 'Work Smart, Be Spirited 
and Be Supportive'. During 2015 the 
implementation of the Worldpay Way was 
supported through our leadership teams, 
backed by internal communications and 
using various training programmes to 
ensure it became embedded throughout 
the Group. In addition to our core 
management and technical training, 
specific training programmes are in place 
to support our legal and regulatory 
compliance in areas such as anti-bribery 
and corruption, anti-money laundering, 
competition law, data protection and 
information security. In 2015, the Group 
also launched its own Masters Programme 
qualification in partnership with Middlesex 
University.
Participation in these training 
programmes, compliance with their 
requirements and the output from our 
annual colleague survey is regularly 
reviewed by the Executive Committee and 
the Board to ensure we maintain a positive 
culture across the organisation. 
Whistleblowing
The Worldpay Way also includes full details 
of the Group’s Whistleblowing helpline, 
which allows employees to raise matters in 
confidence, should they not wish to raise 
them with their line manager or a member 
of the Executive Committee. All matters 
raised through the helpline are investigated 
thoroughly and regardless of the outcome, 
reported to the Risk Committee.
Risk management and internal control
A risk aware culture is embedded 
throughout the organisation with every 
single employee responsible for the 
management of risk. 
The Group operates a 'three lines of 
defence’ model, which clearly identifies 
accountabilities and responsibilities as 
follows:
1.  Business line management has primary 
responsibility for the management of 
risk;
2.  Risk and compliance functions assist 
management in developing their 
approach to fulfil their responsibilities; 
and
3.  The Internal Audit function checks that 
the risk management process and risk 
management framework are effective 
and efficient.
Prior to the IPO, the Board carried out 
an enterprise-wide assessment of the 
principal risks of the business. Further 
details of our risk management system and 
the principal risks of the Group and how 
they are being managed and mitigated 
are included in the Principal risks and 
uncertainties section on page 55.
The Audit Committee oversees the activity 
of the Group Internal Audit ('GIA') function. 
The role of GIA is to evaluate the 
effectiveness of the Group’s risk 
management, control and governance 
processes. As mentioned on page 88, the 
Audit Committee supported the 
appointment of a high-calibre Chief Internal 
Auditor with the remit of strengthening and 
enhancing the skills within the function in 
order to enhance the quality of assurance 
work provided to the Group.

Overview
Strategic report
Directors’ report

Shareholder information
 
A risk-based internal audit plan is prepared 
by GIA on an annual basis. The audit plan, 
which is reviewed and approved by the 
Audit Committee, considers key risks and 
emerging strategic risks maintained in the 
risk registers. In addition, as part of the 
annual planning cycle, GIA consult with 
Senior Management across the business, 
consider the results of previous audits 
(internal and external) and monitor the 
implementation status of audit 
recommendations. This activity ensures 
that the Internal Audit function focuses on 
the most significant risk areas and related 
key controls.
A formal audit report is issued for each 
internal audit undertaken, this includes an 
overall rating and clear actions to be 
undertaken to resolve control issues 
raised.
The results of audit activity are also 
presented to the Audit Committee each 
quarter. This includes highlighting 
common issues, themes and areas of 
concern. A monthly list of internal control 
issues is also maintained and reported to 
the business for action.
On a day-to-day basis, the Chief Internal 
Auditor reports to the Chief Financial 
Officer. There is a clear reporting line to 
the Audit Committee Chair and it is the 
role of the Audit Committee to assess the 
performance of the Chief Internal Auditor 
and Group Internal Audit function. This is 
stated in the Audit Committee terms of 
reference.
Review of the effectiveness of the risk 
management and internal control 
systems
During the period, the Board, through the 
work of the Risk Committee and the Audit 
Committee, has conducted a review of the 
effectiveness of the Group’s system of risk 
management and internal control. Prior to 
the IPO, there was an on-going process for 
the identification and evaluation of risk 
management and internal control 
processes. This has been improved since 
the IPO and remains in place up to the 
date of the financial statements. The work 
conducted by management is 
complemented, supported and challenged 
by the controls assurance work carried 
out independently by the external 
auditors, KPMG, and the Group Internal 
Audit function. Regular reports on control 
issues are presented to the Audit 
Committee by the Chief Internal Auditor. 
The Board, in reviewing the effectiveness 
of the system of internal control, can 
confirm that necessary actions have been 
or are being taken to remedy any 
significant failings or weaknesses 
identified from that review.
Internal control and risk management in 
relation to the financial reporting process
The Group has a thorough assurance 
process in place in respect of the 
preparation, verification and approval of 
periodic financial reports. This process 
includes:
 The involvement of highly experienced  
 and professional employees;
   Formal sign-offs from appropriate 
business unit managing directors and 
finance directors;
  Comprehensive review by key internal 
Group functions;
  A transparent process to ensure full 
disclosure of information to the 
external auditors;
  Engagement of a professional and 
experienced firm of external auditors;
 Review and challenge by executive  
 management; and
   Oversight by the Group’s Audit 
Committee, involving (among other 
duties):
 – A detailed review of key financial 
reporting judgements which have 
been discussed by management;
 – Review and, where appropriate, 
challenge on matters including:
 – the consistency of, and any 
changes to, significant 
accounting policies and practices 
during the year;
 – significant adjustments resulting 
from the external audit;
 – the going concern assumption;
 – the viability statement; and
 – the Company’s statement on 
internal control systems.
The above process, which is reviewed by 
the Audit Committee, provides comfort to 
the Board when considering whether the 
Annual Report and Accounts are fair, 
balanced and understandable.
Fair, balanced and understandable
The Directors confirm that they consider 
the Annual Report and Accounts, taken as 
a whole, is fair, balanced and 
understandable and provides the 
information necessary for shareholders to 
assess the Company’s position and 
performance, business model and 
strategy. In making this confirmation, the 
Directors took into account their 
knowledge of the business, which is kept 
up to date with regular reports, updates 
and business reviews circulated prior to 
and discussed at each Board meeting, and 
supplemented by a variety of written 
reports, verbal updates and presentations 
given at Board and Committee meetings 
as well as a regular flow of information 
about the business between meetings. 
The Directors then took into account the 
thorough preparation and verification 
process in respect of the Annual Report 
and Accounts, which included sufficient 
time for the Directors to review the Annual 
Report and Accounts and to feed in their 
comments to management before 
approving the document.
Disclosure of information to auditors
Each of the Directors who held office at 
the date of approval of this Directors’ 
report confirms that: so far as he/she is 
aware, there is no relevant audit 
information of which the Company’s 
auditors are unaware; and that he/she has 
taken all steps that he/she ought to have 
taken as a Director to make him/her aware 
of any relevant audit information and to 
establish that the Company’s auditors are 
aware of that information.

Shareholder communication and 
engagement
The Company places considerable 
importance on communication with its 
shareholders. The Vice Chairman, Chief 
Executive Officer and the Chief Financial 
Officer are closely involved in investor 
relations supported by the Investor 
Relations function, which has primary 
responsibility for day-to-day 
communication with investors. 
The Board recognises the importance of 
promoting mutual understanding between 
the Company and its shareholders 
through a programme of engagement. It is 
intended that in 2016 this will include the 
maintenance of a regular dialogue 
between the Board and senior 
management and major shareholders. 
During the period leading up to the IPO 
and to the date of this report, the Chief 
Executive Officer, Vice Chairman and 
Chief Financial Officer conducted a large 
number of meetings with institutional 
investors, and it is intended that this 
dialogue will develop further in 2016 
through a programme of meetings with 
shareholders and potential shareholders, 
as well as through presentations and 
meetings at investor conferences, and 
day-to-day contact with the Investor 
Relations function. To further support 
engagement with our shareholders, we 
also actively engage with sell-side 
research analysts who provide their 
recommendations to the market.
The Company makes every effort to 
ascertain investor perceptions of the 
Company and regular reports of investor 
and analyst feedback are provided to the 
Board. The Investor Relations Director and 
the Company’s brokers present to the 
Board as required.
The Company uses its website and email 
as the primary means of communication 
with its shareholders. This arrangement 
provides significant benefits for 
shareholders and the Company in terms of 
timeliness of information, reduced 
environmental impact and cost. The 
Group’s Annual Report and Accounts 2015 
is available to all shareholders and can be 
accessed via the Company’s website at 
www.worldpay.com. Shareholders may still 
opt to receive their communications in a 
paper format. The Group’s interim results 
are also published on the Company’s 
website, together with other 
announcements and documents issued to 
the market, such as trading updates and 
presentations. Enquiries from 
shareholders may also be addressed to 
the Group’s investor relations function 
through the contacts provided on the 
Group’s website.
All shareholders are entitled to attend the 
Annual General Meeting. Shareholders are 
given the opportunity to lodge their votes 
by way of proxy and/or to attend such 
meetings in person where they have the 
opportunity to ask questions of the Board 
including the chairs of the Board 
Committees, vote by way of a poll and 
meet informally with the Directors to 
discuss any issues they may wish to raise.
In January 2016, the Chairman of the 
Remuneration Committee conducted a 
consultation with the Group’s major 
shareholders and shareholder 
representative organisations to gauge 
their views in respect of the Group’s 
remuneration policy and framework and 
specifically the proposed performance 
measures and targets for the next award 
under the Long Term Incentive Plan. The 
views expressed by shareholders were 
taken into account when finalising 
executive remuneration arrangements.

Remuneration report
Dear shareholder, 
On behalf of the Board I am pleased to 
present our first remuneration report as  
a listed company for the financial year 
ending 31 December 2015.
The report has been prepared in three 
sections:
   T h i s s h a re ho l de r l e t t e r ;
   Our policy report which sets out the 
Director’s remuneration policy for all 
Directors of Worldpay Group plc and 
will be subject to a binding vote at 
our 2016 AGM; and
   Our annual report on remuneration 
which sets out details of how our 
Directors were paid during the financial 
year 2015 and how our policy will be 
implemented in the coming year. 
This part of the report is subject to 
an advisory shareholder vote at our 
2016 AGM.
Prior to taking on the Chairmanship role, 
I was a member of the relevant pre-IPO 
Remuneration Committee. That 
Committee spent a significant period of 
time ensuring the remuneration elements 
would be able to transition into a best 
practice reward framework expected of 
a FTSE 100 company. As a result of the 
extensive work undertaken, I am pleased 
the policy report outlines the new reward 
platform that will be deployed from 2016 
and beyond.
The Remuneration Committee hopes that 
you will find the report clear, transparent 
and informative and that we can rely on 
your support for our Remuneration Policy 
and its implementation during the 
coming year.
Business and remuneration context
Worldpay is a leader in global payments, 
which is a complex and dynamic market. 
Our strategy is designed to deliver 
sustainable, recurring growth over 
the medium term by supporting our 
customers with products and services 
that enable them to drive their sales, 
reduce their costs and their risk.
One of the key drivers of the Company’s 
success and for the future is the strong, 
experienced and highly capable 
management team.
Therefore, it is important that our 
remuneration philosophy incentivises 
our senior executives in a manner which 
is aligned to our strategy.
Prior to our IPO in October 2015, Worldpay 
was privately owned and the management 
team previously had personally invested 
into the business. As a result of the IPO, 
the management team continue to own 
a material number of shares (as expressed 
as a percentage of their base salary) 
and have agreed to these shares being 
locked-up for up to three years post-IPO. 
This helps demonstrate their on-going 
and personal commitment to the 
continued success of our business.
Worldpay has a track record of delivering 
year-on-year growth in revenue and 
profitability. In turn, this has supported 
the significant investment that we have 
made in our engineering and technology 
capabilities, which supports the growth 
and development of our new products 
for our customers. These investments will 
provide an important growth engine for 
the future and we anticipate that they will 
drive future value for our shareholders.
This growth in performance was 
supported by a remuneration framework 
with a strong emphasis on pay for 
performance. As we look forward as 
a publicly owned company, we intend 
to continue to apply a remuneration 
philosophy which is simple, focused 
on delivering exceptional performance 
and which is aligned with shareholders’ 
interests, whilst managing risk in a 
sustainable way.
Our approach to remuneration has, 
therefore, been to carefully balance 
what is considered to be best practice for 
remuneration in a UK-listed environment 
with the need to ensure that the 
arrangements in place are competitive in 
the labour markets in which we compete 
for talent.
 Our remuneration 
philosophy and framework 
have a strong emphasis on 
pay for performance and 
are fully aligned with our 
strategy.
John Allan, CBE
Chairman of the Remuneration 
Committee 98
Worldpay Group plc
Annual Report and Accounts 2015
This has resulted in a model where the 
majority of the remuneration package is 
performance based and set at a market 
median level. Fixed pay is set at median 
levels in comparison to other comparable 
companies of our size and complexity. 
The annual incentive opportunity has 
historically been paid fully in cash. From 
2016, the Executive Directors’ bonuses 
earned will be one-third deferred into 
shares for a period of three years.
2015 pay structure
Prior to the IPO, the remuneration of 
the Executive Directors was reviewed to 
ensure that the arrangements in place 
were appropriate in the context of their 
roles going forward. 
A simple remuneration structure is 
proposed comprising the following 
elements:
   Fixed pay (base salary, benefits 
and pension);
   Short-term annual bonus; and
   Long Term Incentive Plan.
Annual bonus
The annual bonus plan is driven by 
financial measures relevant to the 
business. For 2015 performance the 
financial measures chosen were equally 
weighted between a profit and cash 
measure. We use EBITDA as the main 
measure of profit and use a proxy measure 
for cash that focuses management on 
the underlying cash generation of the 
business. The details of this measure 
are shown later in the report. 
In addition to these financial measures, 
the bonus plan enables the Committee 
to set key individual strategic objectives. 
These measures provide individuals with 
a strong line of sight and are aligned to 
delivering the key strategic objectives of 
the business to help deliver long-term 
sustainable growth.
The 2015 bonus is multiplicative in 
computation and has been since the Group 
was privately owned. From 2016, the annual 
bonus for the Executive Directors will be 
structured in an additive manner, with 75% 
based on financial measures and 25% on 
key strategic objectives, as outlined in the 
Directors' remuneration policy.
Performance Share Plan
The long-term incentive arrangements 
for the Executive Directors will be entirely 
performance-based and fully aligned with 
best practice for UK-listed companies. 
The details of the proposed targets are 
set out in the Remuneration report.
In recognition of the size of the awards, the 
performance targets are set at stretching 
levels to ensure that management are only 
rewarded if significant value is delivered 
to shareholders. 
Clawback and malus
In line with the recent guidance in the UK 
Corporate Governance Code, all of our 
share-based incentive plans include malus 
and clawback provisions.
Shareholder engagement
We engaged with our top 20 shareholders 
in January 2016 on our proposed 
remuneration approach and the intended 
performance measures to be used in our 
incentive arrangements. We value 
shareholder feedback and are very 
encouraged by the support and 
comments we have received to date.
We hope to receive your support for our 
policy report and our annual report on 
remuneration at our forthcoming AGM.

Purpose and link to strategy Operation Opportunity Performance measures
Base salary
To provide a level of fixed 
pay which supports the 
recruitment and retention of 
Executives of the calibre to 
deliver the strategy of the 
business 
Base salaries are reviewed annually typically with 
effect from 1 April.
When determining salary levels the Remuneration 
Committee takes account of the following:
  Pay and conditions of the wider workforce
  Individual performance
  Competitive practice in other FTSE 100 companies 
and organisations with whom Worldpay directly 
competes for talent.
To avoid setting expectations of 
Executive Directors and other 
employees, no maximum salary is 
set under the remuneration 
policy. 
Salary increases for Executive 
Directors will normally be aligned 
with those of the wider 
workforce. 
Increases may be made above 
this level to take account of 
individual circumstances, which 
may include:
  Increases to reflect an 
individual’s development and 
performance in role. For 
example, where a new 
incumbent is appointed on a 
below market salary
   Increase in the size or scope of 
the role or responsibilities. 
n/a
Pension
To provide appropriate 
levels of retirement benefit.
Executive Directors may receive a cash allowance, 
contributions into the Worldpay Pension Scheme, a 
defined contribution scheme or a combination thereof.
Executive Directors may receive a 
maximum contribution from the 
company of 20% of salary per 
annum.
n/a
Benefits
To provide a market-
competitive level of 
benefits. 
Executive Directors may receive various market 
competitive benefits, which may include: a car 
allowance, use of a driver, reimbursed travel expenses, 
private medical and annual health check, disability and 
life assurance.
Where appropriate, other benefits may be provided to 
take account of individual circumstances, such as but 
not limited to: expatriate allowances, relocation 
expense, housing allowance and education support.
Benefits for Executive Directors 
are set at a level which the 
Remuneration Committee 
considers to be appropriate 
against wider employee benefits 
as well as competitive practice in 
other FTSE 100 companies and 
organisations with whom 
Worldpay directly competes for 
talent.
n/a
Annual bonus and deferred annual bonus
The role of the annual bonus 
is to incentivise strong 
financial performance and 
reward the delivery of the 
business strategy on an 
annual basis.
Deferral into shares 
provides alignment with 
shareholders.
Performance is assessed on an annual basis. 
Targets are set by the Remuneration Committee at the 
start of the financial year. At the end of the year, the 
Committee determines the level of bonus to be paid 
taking into account the extent to which these targets 
have been achieved.
The Committee has discretion to adjust the formulaic 
bonus outcomes both upwards and downwards 
(including to zero) to ensure alignment of pay with 
performance, e.g. in the event performance is 
impacted by unforeseen circumstances outside of 
management control.
The annual bonus is normally delivered two-thirds in 
cash and one-third is compulsorily deferred into shares 
for a period of at least three years. Executives may 
elect to voluntarily defer more than one-third of their 
bonus into shares.
Dividend equivalents will be paid in cash or additional 
shares once the deferred shares are released.
The maximum annual bonus 
opportunity is 200% of base 
salary per annum.
The current maximum bonus 
levels applying to each of the 
Executive Directors are included 
in the annual remuneration 
report.
Bonuses are based on a 
combination of stretching 
annual financial and 
non-financial/strategic 
performance measures, 
with the majority of the 
bonus assessed against 
financial measures.
The Remuneration 
Committee will determine 
the weighting between 
different metrics each 
year according to 
business priorities.
For target performance, 
up to 50% of the maximum 
bonus opportunity may be 
received.
Further details, including 
the performance 
measures set for each 
year, are disclosed in the 
annual report on 
remuneration.

Purpose and link to strategy Operation Opportunity Performance measures
Performance Share Plan ('PSP')
The role of the PSP is to 
incentivise and reward 
Executive Directors for 
achieving the long-term 
performance objectives of 
the Company which are 
aligned to the strategic 
goals.
The PSP also acts as a 
retention tool.
Awards under the PSP will normally be made in the 
form of nil cost options over shares but may be made 
in other forms such as conditional or forfeitable shares 
or a payment made in cash.
Awards will be calculated based on a percentage of 
salary and the market share price at grant in 
accordance with the rules.
Prior to awards being granted each year the 
performance conditions and targets are set to ensure 
they remain appropriately stretching and aligned to 
the strategy of the business.
The PSP has a performance period of at least three 
years and a minimum vesting period of three years. 
Awards will normally be subject to an additional 
holding period with 50% of the award being received 
after four years and the remaining 50% after five years.
Dividend equivalents may be paid in cash or additional 
shares on LTIP awards that vest.
The Committee has discretion to adjust the formulaic 
outcome of the PSP to ensure the outcome takes 
account of any major changes to the Company (e.g. as 
a result of mergers and acquisitions) and is a fair 
reflection of the performance of the Company.
The maximum PSP opportunity is 
300% of base salary per annum.
The current PSP opportunities 
applying to each of the Executive 
Directors are included in the 
annual remuneration report.
Vesting of the PSP is 
subject to continued 
employment during the 
performance period and 
the achievement of key 
financial and strategic 
performance conditions 
which are aligned to the 
Company’s strategic plan.
At least 50% of a PSP 
award will be based on 
financial metrics.
Threshold performance 
will result in up to 25% of a 
PSP award vesting. No 
part of a PSP award will 
vest for performance 
below the threshold. 
Further details, including 
the performance targets 
attached to the PSP in 
respect of each year, are 
disclosed in the annual 
report on remuneration.

strong alignment with 
shareholders and act as a 
retention tool during the 
initial years of Worldpay as a 
quoted company.
Awards under the Transition Award Plan were made on 
a one-off basis upon listing.
Executive Directors are required to hold at least 100% 
of basic salary in Worldpay Group plc shares for 36 
months from the Admission Date as well as be subject 
to continued employment.

Notes to the policy table
Payments outside policy
The Committee reserves the right to make 
any remuneration payments and 
payments for loss of office (including 
exercising any discretions available to it in 
connection with such payments) 
notwithstanding that they are not in line 
with the policy set out in this report where 
the terms of the payment were agreed (1) 
before the policy came into effect or (2) at 
a time when the relevant individual was 
not a Director of the Company, and in the 
opinion of the Committee, the payment 
was not in consideration of the individual 
becoming a Director of the Company. 
Clawback and malus
The Committee has the discretion to scale 
back (known as ‘malus’) Deferred Share 
Awards made under the Annual Bonus 
Plan, Performance Share Plan awards and 
awards under the Transition Award Plan 
prior to the satisfaction of awards in the 
event that results are materially misstated, 
there is gross misconduct or significant 
reputational damage. 
Where Deferred Share Awards made under 
the Annual Bonus Plan, Performance 
Share Plan awards or awards under the 
Transition Award Plan have vested the 
Committee have the discretion to 
‘clawback’ awards up to the fifth 
anniversary of the grant of the awards in 
the circumstances described above.
Cash bonuses can also be ‘clawed back’ in 
the circumstances described above up to 
the third anniversary of payment.
Performance measure selection and 
approach to target setting
Annual bonus
The annual bonus performance measures 
are selected to provide an appropriate 
balance between incentivising Executive 
Directors to meet the key financial targets 
of the business for the year and 
incentivising them to achieve specific 
strategic objectives. The particular 
measures each year are chosen to ensure 
focus on the key objectives aligned with 
the strategy of the business in each 
financial year. 
PSP
In respect of the PSP , the Committee 
regularly reviews the performance 
measures to ensure that they are aligned 
with the Company’s strategy in light of the 
long-term strategic plan and with our 
shareholders’ interests over the longer term. 
T argets for both the annual bonus and PSP 
are reviewed annually against a number of 
internal and external reference points. 
T argets are set on a sliding scale at levels the 
Committee considers to be appropriately 
stretching for the level of award delivered.
Remuneration policy for other employees
The remuneration policy for Executive 
Directors in general is more heavily weighted 
towards variable pay than for other employees. 
The majority of employees participate in an 
annual bonus plan, but PSP awards are only 
made to the most senior (c.80) individuals in 
the Group. Individuals below this level may 
receive annual awards of restricted stock 
which vest after three years.
The Company’s approach to annual salary 
reviews is consistent across the Group, 
with consideration given to the level of 
experience, responsibility, individual 
performance and salary levels for 
comparable roles in comparable companies.
All UK employees may be eligible to 
participate in the Company’s SAYE and SIP 
plans on identical terms and those outside 
of the UK in comparable plans where 
appropriate.
Shareholder alignment
The Committee recognises the 
importance of aligning Executive 
Directors’ and shareholder interests 
through executives building up significant 
shareholdings in the Company. Executive 
Directors are expected to acquire a 
significant number of shares over a period 
of five years and retain these until 
retirement from the Board of Directors. 
The shareholding requirement is 300% of 
salary for the CEO and 200% of salary for 
all other Executive Directors. Details of the 
Executive Directors’ current personal 
shareholdings are provided in the annual 
report on remuneration on page 109.
Scenario analysis
The charts on the following page provide 
an estimate of the potential future reward 
opportunities for the Executive Directors, 
and the potential split between the 
different elements of remuneration under 
three different performance scenarios: 
‘Minimum’, ‘Target’ and ‘Maximum’.
Non-Executive Director remuneration
The Chairman and Non-Executive 
Directors do not have service agreements, 
but are engaged on the basis of a letter of 
appointment. In line with the UK 
Corporate Governance Code (September 
2014) guidelines, all Directors are subject 
to re-election annually at the AGM.
It is the policy of the Board of Directors 
that Non-Executive Directors are not 
eligible to participate in any of the 
Company’s bonus, long-term incentive or 
pension schemes. 
Details of the policy on fees paid to our 
Non-Executive Directors are set out in the 
table on the following page. 102
Worldpay Group plc
Annual Report and Accounts 2015
The scenario analysis charts are based on the following assumptions:
Minimum – Base salary as at 31 December 2015 plus pension and fixed allowances.
Target – Minimum plus Target annual bonus (including deferred element and represents 50% of maximum bonus) plus Threshold LTIP opportunity (25% of maximum).
Maximum – Minimum plus Maximum annual bonus (including deferred element) plus Maximum LTIP opportunity.

Non-Executive Director remuneration
Component and objective Approach of the Company
Fees 
To attract and retain Non-
Executive Directors of the  
highest calibre with broad 
commercial experience 
relevant to the Company.
The fees paid to Non-Executive Directors are determined by the Board of Directors, with 
recommendations provided by the Chairman and CEO. The fees of the Chairman are determined 
by the Remuneration Committee.
Additional fees are payable for acting as Senior Independent Non-Executive Director and 
as Chairman of the Audit, Remuneration and Risk Committees. Members of the Audit, 
Remuneration, Nomination and Risk Committees also receive an additional fee.
Fee levels may be reviewed annually. Fees are reviewed by taking into account external advice on 
best practice and competitive levels, in particular at FTSE 100 companies. Time commitment and 
responsibility are also taken into account when reviewing fees.
Chairman and Non-Executive fees are paid in cash. 
The Committee reimburses the Chairman and Non-Executive Directors for reasonable expenses 
in performing their duties and may settle any tax incurred in relation to these duties. For any 
Non-Executive Director that is based overseas, the Company will meet travel and 
accommodation expenditure as required to fulfil Non-Executive duties. 
The fees paid to the Chairman and Non-Executive Directors in respect of the year under review 
are disclosed in the annual report on remuneration.
Aggregate fees are limited to £3.0m by the Company’s Articles of Association. 103

Approach to recruitment remuneration
External appointment
When determining the remuneration 
package for a new Executive Director, the 
Committee will take into account all 
relevant factors based on the 
circumstances at that time. This may 
include factors such as the calibre of the 
individual, the jurisdiction the candidate 
was recruited from, the candidate’s current 
reward opportunity and the scope of the 
role to which they are being appointed.
Typically, the package will be aligned to the 
Company’s remuneration policy as set out 
above. However, should there be a 
commercial rationale for doing so, the 
Remuneration Committee has the 
discretion to include any other 
remuneration elements which are not 
included in the on-going remuneration 
policy, subject to the overall limit on 
variable remuneration set out below. The 
Committee does not intend to use this 
discretion to make non-performance 
incentive payments and is always mindful 
of the need to pay no more than is 
necessary.
The overall limit of variable remuneration 
will be as set out in the policy table taking 
into account the maximum value of the 
annual bonus and the maximum awards 
under the PSP (i.e. 500% of salary).
The Committee may make an award in 
respect of a new appointment to ‘buy out’ 
incentive arrangements forfeited on 
leaving a previous employer, i.e. over and 
above maximum limit on variable 
remuneration set out above. In doing so, 
the Committee will consider relevant 
factors including any performance 
conditions attached to these awards, the 
likelihood of those conditions being met 
and the time over which they would have 
vested. The intention is that the value of 
any buy-out award would be no higher 
than the expected value of the forfeited 
arrangements and made on a like-for-like 
basis.
Internal promotion
In cases of appointing a new Executive 
Director by way of internal promotion, the 
policy will be consistent with that for 
external appointees, as detailed above. 
Where an individual has contractual 
commitments made prior to their 
promotion to Executive Director level, the 
Company will continue to honour these 
arrangements even in instances where 
they would not otherwise be consistent 
with the prevailing Executive Director 
remuneration policy at the time of 
appointment.
Non-Executive Directors
In recruiting a new Non-Executive 
Director, the Remuneration Committee 
will use the policy as set out in the table on 
page 102. A base fee in line with the 
current fee schedule would be payable for 
membership of the Board of Directors, 
with additional fees payable for acting as 
Senior Independent Non-Executive 
Director, as Chairman of the Audit, 
Remuneration and Risk Committees, and 
for being a member of the Audit, 
Remuneration, Nomination and Risk 
Committees. 
Service contracts and exit 
payment policy
Executive Director service contracts, 
including arrangements for termination, 
are carefully considered by the 
Committee. In accordance with general 
market practice, each of the Executive 
Directors has a rolling service contract 
which is terminable on 12 months’ notice 
and this practice will also apply for any 
new Executive Directors. 
In such an event, the compensation 
commitments in respect of their contracts 
could amount to one year’s remuneration 
based on base salary, benefits in kind and 
pension rights during the notice period. 
Termination payments may take the form 
of payments in lieu of notice. Payments 
would be made on a phased basis and 
subject to mitigation. 
Copies of Executive Director service 
contracts are available to view at the 
Company’s registered office.
If the employment is terminated by the 
Company, the Remuneration Committee 
retains the discretion to settle any other 
amounts reasonably payable to the 
Executive Director including legal fees 
incurred in connection with the termination 
and fees for outplacement services.
The Company’s policy on any termination 
payments is to consider the 
circumstances on a case-by-case basis, 
taking into account the relevant 
contractual terms in the executive’s 
service contract and the circumstances of 
the termination. 
The table on the following page 
summarises how awards under each 
incentive plan are typically treated in 
specific circumstances, with the final 
treatment remaining subject to the 
Committee’s discretion as provided under 
the rules of the plan.
External appointments 
With the approval of the Board of 
Directors in each case, and subject to the 
overriding requirements of the Company, 
Executive Directors may accept one 
external appointment as a Non-Executive 
Director of another company and retain 
the fees paid in this role. Details of 
external appointments and the associated 
fees received are included in the annual 
report on remuneration.
Consideration of conditions elsewhere in 
the Company
The Committee does not consult with 
employees specifically on executive 
remuneration policy. However, the 
Committee considers pay practices 
across the Company and is mindful of the 
salary increases applying across the rest 
of the business in relevant markets when 
considering salaries for Executive 
Directors.
Consideration of shareholder views 
The Committee considers shareholder 
views received during the year and at the 
Annual General Meeting each year, as well 
as guidance from shareholder 
representative bodies more broadly, in 
shaping remuneration policy. This 
feedback, and any additional feedback 
received from time to time, will then be 
considered as part of the Company’s 
annual review of remuneration. It is the 
Committee’s intention to consult with 
major shareholders in advance of making 
any material changes to remuneration 
arrangements. 104

Shareholder information
 
The following section provides details of 
how our remuneration policy was 
implemented during the year ended 
31 December 2015.
Remuneration Committee membership 
in 2015
As of 31 December 2015, the Remuneration 
Committee was made up of the following 
three Non-Executive Directors:
1.  John Allan (Chairman)
2. Martin Scicluna
3.  Sir Michael Rake
Subsequently, on 29 January 2016, Sir 
Michael Rake stepped down from the 
Committee and Deanna Oppenheimer 
was appointed as a member.
The Chairman’s membership of the 
Remuneration Committee was permitted 
under the Code as he was independent on 
appointment as Chairman (provision D.3.1).
The Committee’s purpose is to assist 
the Board of Directors in fulfilling its 
oversight responsibility by ensuring that 
remuneration policy and practices 
reward fairly and responsibly; are linked to 
corporate and individual performance; and 
take account of the generally accepted 
principles of good governance. 
The Committee determines and 
recommends to the Board:
   The Group’s policy on executive 
remuneration; 
  The annual report on remuneration to 
be approved by shareholders; and 
   In respect of the Chairman, the 
Executive Directors and Executive 
Committee members determines:
 – Terms and conditions of employment, 
including the Executive Directors’ 
service agreements;
 – The level of remuneration (including 
base salary, benefits, pension, annual 
bonus and long-term incentives);
 – Performance measures and targets 
for annual bonus and long-term 
incentive plans.
The Chairman of the Board of Directors 
and the CEO are responsible for evaluating 
and making recommendations to the 
Board of Directors on the remuneration of 
the Non-Executive Directors. Members of 
the Remuneration Committee and any 
person attending its meetings do not 
participate in any discussion or decision 
on their own remuneration.
Following the IPO, the Remuneration 
Committee held one meeting during the 
year. This was held on 8 December 2015.
Advisers
Deloitte LLP assisted the Company on 
remuneration-related matters in the 
build-up to the IPO and was formally 
approved as advisor to the Remuneration 
Committee on 8 December 2015 following 
the listing of the Company. Deloitte LLP is a 
member of the Remuneration Consultants’ 
Group and, as such, voluntarily operates 
under the Code of Conduct in relation to 
executive remuneration consulting in the 
UK. Fees paid to Deloitte as advisors to the 
Remuneration Committee from the point 
of listing to 31 December 2015 amounted 
to £12,600. 
Single total figure of remuneration for 
Executive Directors (audited)
Table 1, below sets out a single figure for the 
total remuneration received by each 
Executive Director for 2015 from their date 
of appointment. As the Executive Directors 
only became Directors of Worldpay Group 
plc on 3 July 2015, no prior year figures have 
been shown. The values of each element of 
remuneration are based on the actual value 
delivered, where known. 
Incentive outcomes for the year ended 
31 December 2015 (audited)
Annual bonus in respect of 2015 
performance
The payments under the annual bonus for 
2015 will be made in cash and relate to the 
annual bonus plan that was set at the start 
of the financial year, prior to the listing of 
the Company. Changes have been made 
to the annual bonus plan for 2016 to 
simplify arrangements and bring the plan 
more in line with best practice for a listed 
company, further details of which are 
provided on page 99.
The CEO had a target bonus opportunity of 
100% of base salary and the other 
Executive Directors a target opportunity of 
80% of salary (with the exception of the 
Executive Director and Vice Chairman who 
had an historic arrangement whereby his 
target was 100% of base salary and which 
was amended in-line with policy on  
1 September 2015). If maximum performance 
is achieved, 2x the target opportunity may 
be received. For 2015, the annual bonus was

objective of these awards is to focus 
individuals on a successful transition from 
a private to a public company and to retain 
key individuals over the next three years.

years, subject to continued employment 
and each individual holding shares 
representing 100% of base salary for the 
duration of the vesting period, as shown

2  Also, in connection with the reorganisation that took place prior to the IPO, John Allan and Martin Scicluna 
waived their respective entitlements to any interest in Contingent Value Rights (‘CVRs’) a separate class of 
shares in the Company. In order to recognise the obligations and responsibilities associated with their role 
as Independent Non-Executive Directors, John Allan and Martin Scicluna received one-off payments from 
AB JV Global S.à r.l (the then ultimate parent Company of the Company) of £1.9m and £365,000 respectively. 
At the time they were made, these lump sum payments were not referable to the potential value of the CVRs, 
which did not have any value for accounting purposes. 50% of the after-tax proceeds from these lump sum 
payments were reinvested in ordinary shares, in respect of which they have entered into a 365-day lock-up 
agreement with the Company and the Underwriters to the IPO.

Two-thirds of any bonus paid will be 
received in cash with the remaining third 
being deferred into Worldpay Group plc

The annual bonus for 2016 will be based on 
the following measures and weightings:
Measure Weighting
EBITDA 37.5%
Cash metric 37.5%
Personal objectives 25%
We intend to disclose the targets in 
respect of each financial metric on a 
retrospective basis at the same time the 
performance outcome is disclosed in the 
remuneration report after the end of each 
financial year.
Cash bonuses may be clawed back up to 
the third anniversary of payment and any 
deferred share awards may be subject 
malus and/or clawback up to the fifth 
anniversary of the date of grant, in the 
event that results are materially misstated, 
there is gross misconduct, or significant 
reputational damage.
Worldpay L TIP
For 2016 the CEO will receive an award 
under the Worldpay LTIP with a maximum 
opportunity of 200% of salary. The 
maximum opportunity for other Executive 
Directors will be 150% of salary.
The LTIP award granted in 2016 will 
be assessed against the following 
performance measures and targets which 
will be measured over three financial 
years, as shown in table 7, above.
EPS and EBITDA have been selected 
as measures as they are the financial 
performance measures which will 
most closely reward the delivery of 
our growth strategy. 
The strategic measures for the PSP awards 
to be made in 2016 will reward the growth 
of our customer numbers in our small and 
medium segments, as well as completing 
the migration of customers onto our new 
technology platform, as these will be key 
areas of focus for the business. The 
performance target ranges have been set 
at stretching levels taking into account 
both internal and external forecasts, with 
maximum vesting only occurring for 
significant outperformance. 
To provide further alignment with 
shareholders over the longer term 
any awards that vest for the Executive 
Management team will be subject to an 
additional holding period. Half of the 
shares will be released on the fourth 
anniversary of the date of grant and the 
remaining half released after five years.
Awards under the PSP may be clawed back 
up to the fifth anniversary of the date of 
grant in the event that results are materially 
misstated, there is gross misconduct, or 
significant reputational damage.

As permitted by legislation, some of 
the matters normally included in this

the Strategic report on pages 8 to 76 
as the Board considers them to be of 
strategic importance. Specifically, 
these relate to the Company’s business

Relationship Agreement with the 
Significant Shareholder
In accordance with the Listing Rules, 
the Company entered into a Relationship 
Agreement with Ship Global 2 & CY S.C.A. 
(the 'Significant Shareholder') on 12 
October 2015. The principal purpose of the 
Relationship Agreement is to ensure that 
the Company is capable of carrying on its 
business independently of its Significant 
Shareholder. 
Advent and Bain, who are associates of 
the Significant Shareholder and continue 
to be significant investors in the Company, 
are each entitled under the Relationship 
Agreement to appoint one Non-Executive 
Director to the Board for as long as Advent 
and Bain are respectively entitled to 
exercise, or to control, directly or indirectly, 
10% or more of the votes at general 
meetings of the Company. The first 
nominee Directors are James Brocklebank 
in respect of Advent and Robin Marshall 
in respect of Bain.
Under the Relationship Agreement, the 
Significant Shareholder has undertaken 
that it shall not (and shall procure that 
its associates shall not):
  Take any action that would preclude or 
inhibit the Company or any member of 
the Group from operating independently 
of the Significant Shareholder;
 Take any action that would prevent  
 the Company from complying with its  
 obligations under the Listing Rules;
  Propose any shareholder resolution 
which is intended to circumvent the 
Listing Rules;
 Conduct any transactions and   
 arrangements with the Group other  
 than on an arm’s-length basis and  
 on normal commercial terms;
  Act in any way which it knows will 
render the Company unsuitable for 
continued listing on the London 
Stock Exchange; and
  Vote on any resolution to approve a 
'related party transaction' where the 
Significant Shareholder is the related party.
The Company has complied with and, 
so far as the Company is aware, the 
Significant Shareholder has complied 
with (and has procured compliance by 
its associates with) the independence 
provisions under the Relationship 
Agreement outlined above.
Directors’ appointment, conflicts 
of interest and powers of Directors
Directors’ appointment
With regard to the appointment and

by the Company by ordinary resolution or

Nomination Committee. In addition, the 
Relationship Agreement between the 
Company and the Company’s Significant 
Shareholder (see paragraph 1 above) 
provides for the latter to appoint Non-
Executive Directors to the Board.  
A Director appointed by the Board holds 
office only until the following Annual 
General Meeting and is then eligible for 
election by shareholders. The Company 
may, in accordance with and subject to 
the provisions of the Companies Act 2006, 
by ordinary resolution of which special 
notice has been given remove any Director 
before the expiration of his or her term of 
office.

Share capital and related matters
Share capital
The structure of the issued share capital 
of the Company at 31 December 2015 and 
information about the issue of shares 
during 2015 are set out in Note 5f to the 
financial statements. The Company has 
two classes of shares: Ordinary Shares 
and CVR non-voting redeemable shares.
Shareholders’ rights
The rights attaching to the Ordinary Shares 
are governed by the Company’s Articles 
of Association and prevailing legislation. 
There are no specific restrictions on the 
size of a holding. Subject to applicable law 
and the Articles of Association, holders of 
Ordinary Shares are entitled to receive all 
shareholder documents, including notice 
of any general meeting; attend, speak and 
exercise voting rights at general meetings, 
either in person or by proxy; and participate 
in any distribution of income or capital.
Restrictions on voting
There are no specific restrictions on the 
shareholder’s ability to exercise their 
voting rights, save in situations where the 
Company is legally entitled to impose such 
restrictions (usually where amounts remain 
unpaid on the shares after request, or the 
shareholder is otherwise in default of an 
obligation to the Company). Currently, 
all issued Ordinary Shares are fully paid.
Shares held by the Company’s 
employment benefit trust
The Company’s offshore employee benefit 
trust ('EBT') is used to purchase Worldpay 
Group shares for the benefit of employees, 
including satisfying outstanding awards 
made under its employee share plans. In 
respect of all shares held in the EBT , the 
trustee has  waived its right to receive 
dividends and will not exercise voting rights. 
Further details regarding the EBT are 
contained in Note 1a and 5h to the Financial 
statements.
Restrictions on the transfer of 
Ordinary Shares
From admission of the Company’s securities 
on the Main Market of the London Stock 
Exchange, Ship Global 2 & CY S.C.A. (the 
'Significant Shareholder') entered into 
a lock-up period of 180 days and the 
Company’s Directors entered into a lock-up 
period of 365 days. During the lock-up 
periods, the Significant Shareholder and 
the Directors agree not to dispose of any 
securities held in the Company. Certain 
of the underwriting banks may, however, 
waive the restrictions in respect of the 
lock-up periods before they expire.
The transfer of Ordinary Shares is 
governed by the general provisions of 
the Company’s Articles of Association 
and prevailing legislation. There are no 
restrictions on the transfer of the Ordinary 
Shares other than (i) as set out in the 
lock-up arrangements described in the 
preceding paragraph; (ii) as set out in 
the Articles of Association; (iii) certain 
restrictions which may from time to time 
be imposed by laws and regulations 
(for example, insider trading laws); and 
(iv) pursuant to the Listing Rules of the 
Financial Conduct Authority whereby 
certain Directors, officers and employees 
of the Company require approval to deal 
in the Ordinary Shares in accordance with 
the Company’s share dealing rules.

into by the Company and various lenders 
on 4 September 2015 to refinance existing 
borrowings as part of the IPO (comprising 
the Term Facility 1, Term Facility 2 and the 
revolving credit facility) provides for the 
repayment of all sums utilised together 
with interest on 30 days notice in the 
event of (i) any sale of substantially all of 
the businesses or assets of the Company; 
or (ii) if any person or group of persons 
acting in concert acquire more than 50%

Annual Report and Accounts 2015
Statement of Directors’ responsibilities
The Directors are responsible for 
preparing the Annual Report and 
Accounts and the Group and parent 
Company financial statements in 
accordance with applicable law 
and regulations.
Company law requires the Directors to 
prepare Group and parent Company 
financial statements for each financial 
year. Under that law they are required to 
prepare the Group financial statements in 
accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the 
EU and applicable law and have elected 
to prepare the parent Company financial 
statements in accordance with UK 
Accounting Standards, including FRS 101 
Reduced Disclosure Framework.
Under company law the Directors must 
not approve the financial statements 
unless they are satisfied that they give 
a true and fair view of the state of affairs 
of the Group and parent Company and 
of their profit or loss for that period. In 
preparing each of the Group and parent 
Company financial statements, the 
Directors are required to: 
   Select suitable accounting policies 
and then apply them consistently; 
   Make judgements and estimates 
that are reasonable and prudent; 
   For the Group financial statements, 
state whether they have been prepared 
in accordance with IFRSs as adopted 
by the EU; 
   For the parent Company financial 
statements, state whether applicable 
UK Accounting Standards have been 
followed, subject to any material 
departures disclosed and explained 
in the parent Company financial 
statements; and 
   Prepare the financial statements on 
the going concern basis unless it is 
inappropriate to presume that the 
Group and the parent Company will 
continue in business.
The Directors are responsible for keeping 
adequate accounting records that are 
sufficient to show and explain the parent 
Company’s transactions and disclose 
with reasonable accuracy at any time the 
financial position of the parent Company 
and enable them to ensure that its 
financial statements comply with the 
Companies Act 2006. They have general 
responsibility for taking such steps as are 
reasonably open to them to safeguard the 
assets of the Group and to prevent and 
detect fraud and other irregularities.
Under applicable law and regulations, 
the Directors are also responsible for 
preparing a Strategic report, Directors’ 
report, Directors’ Remuneration report 
and Corporate governance statement  
that complies with that law and those 
regulations.
The Directors are responsible for the 
maintenance and integrity of the 
corporate and financial information 
included on the Company’s website. 
Legislation in the UK governing the 
preparation and dissemination of 
financial statements may differ from 
legislation in other jurisdictions.
Responsibility statement of the Directors 
in respect of the annual financial report
We confirm that to the best of our 
knowledge:
 The financial statements, prepared  
 in accordance with the applicable set  
 of accounting standards, give a true  
 and fair view of the assets, liabilities,  
 financial position and profit or loss of  
 the Company and the undertakings  
 included in the consolidation taken  
 as a whole; and
   The Strategic report and the Directors’ 
report include a fair review of the 
development and performance of the 
business and the position of the issuer 
and the undertakings included in 
the consolidation taken as a whole, 
together with a description of the 
principal risks and uncertainties 
that they face.
We consider the Annual Report and 
Accounts, taken as a whole, is fair, balanced 
and understandable and provides the 
information necessary for shareholders 
to assess the Group’s position and 
performance, business model and strategy.
The Strategic report and the Directors’ 
report comprising pages 8 to 112 have 
been approved and are signed by order

our audit
1 Our opinion on the financial statements 
is unmodified 
We have audited the financial statements 
of Worldpay Group plc for the year ended 
31 December 2015 set out on pages 118 to 
166. In our opinion: 
  The financial statements give a true 
and fair view of the state of the Group’s 
and of the parent Company’s affairs as 
at 31 December 2015 and of the Group’s 
loss for the year then ended; 
  The Group financial statements have 
been properly prepared in accordance 
with International Financial Reporting 
Standards as adopted by the European 
Union; 
  The parent Company financial 
statements have been properly 
prepared in accordance with UK 
Accounting Standards, including FRS 
101 Reduced Disclosure Framework; 
 and
 The financial statements have been  
 prepared in accordance with the   
 requirements of the Companies Act  
 2006; and, as regards the Group   
 financial statements, Article 4 of the  
 IAS Regulation. 
2 Our assessment of risks of material 
misstatement
In arriving at our audit opinion above on 
the financial statements the risks of 
material misstatement that had the 
greatest effect on our audit were as 
follows:
Accuracy, cut-off and classification 
of transaction-based revenue and 
settlement balances, Revenue 
(£3,963.0m), Merchant float (£696.4m), 
Scheme debtors (£534.5m), Merchant 
creditors (£1,230.9m).
Refer to page 90 (Audit Committee 
statement), pages 127 and 143 (accounting 
policy) and pages 129 and 145 (financial 
disclosure).
The risk
The recognition of transaction-based 
revenue and settlement balances arising 
in the payment processing cycle may be 
misstated or not presented in the correct 
financial period. Furthermore, the 
settlement balances may be 
inappropriately classified within the 
balance sheet.
 The processing of payments, from which 
the Group generates the vast majority of 
its revenues, is dependent on highly 
complex IT systems with a number of 
different bases for calculating revenue 
and for settling funds. There were in 
excess of 13 billion transactions processed 
in the year with total gross transaction 
value in excess of £400bn, all requiring a 
correct IT outcome. In addition, the 
appropriate recognition of revenue and 
settlement balances is dependent on core 
finance processes and controls accurately 
reporting on and reconciling these 
transactions.
 There is a risk that a system may not be 
configured correctly from the outset such 
that revenues and settlement amounts 
are calculated incorrectly, that the output 
from the operational systems does not 
correctly flow through to the financial 
information systems, and that 
unauthorised changes may be made to 
any of these systems, which may result in 
the misstatement of revenue and 
settlement balances. 
 The output from these operational IT 
systems is used in the reconciliation of 
settlement funds. The correct 
classification of amounts within the 
balance sheet is dependent upon 
achieving appropriate cut-off which 
accurately reflects the status of all in 
progress transactions at year-end.
 Our response
Our audit procedures varied by business 
unit and therefore we have split our 
response into two sections. Whilst the risk 
is consistent across all business units, the 
nature of systems, processes and controls 
vary between the business in the UK and 
in the US and therefore different audit 
procedures are used in each case. Our 
audit procedures included, amongst 
others, the use of IT audit experts 
throughout the audit process. 
We tested general IT controls related to 
access to programs and data, program 
change and development and computer 
operations in order to address the risk of 
unauthorised changes being made to the 
operation of IT application controls.
We critically assessed the design, 
implementation and operating 
effectiveness of IT application controls 
and tested that the systems are 
configured appropriately. We tested 
controls around customer set up and 
changes to master data that are designed 
to ensure the appropriate rates are 
assigned to each merchant in the system 
based on signed contract terms. We also 
tested the manual controls over the 
reconciliation of settlement accounts to 
scheme, merchant and internally 
generated reports.
   WPUK and Global eCom: Data was 
extracted from the systems and 
revenue was recalculated for a sample 
of merchants based on transaction 
data and contracted rates to test the 
completeness, existence and accuracy 
of revenue. Further analytical 
procedures were performed over the 
entire merchant population, using 
transaction data and contracted rates. 
Controls testing was performed to 
assess completeness and accuracy of 
the key inputs used in these 
procedures.
   We agreed scheme debtor, merchant 
creditor and merchant float amounts to 
third-party confirmations and critically 
assessed the year-end cut-off, paying 
particular attention to the classification 
between settlement funds and own 
cash on the balance sheet based upon 
the underlying legal and commercial 
rights to funds.

Annual Report and Accounts 2015
Overview
Strategic report
Directors’ report
Financial statements 
Shareholder information
    W P U S : A sample of revenue was tested 
through examination of merchant cash 
receipts, confirmations and inspection 
of transaction detail. In conjunction 
with this, a detailed trend analysis of 
revenue by month was performed to 
identify one-off or unusual transactions 
and trends.
  Settlement balances were agreed to 
external data. For example, the scheme 
debtors balance was agreed to the 
network remittance report and to 
subsequent receipt per the bank 
statement; the net settlement 
receivables and payables per the 
year-end settlement reconciliation 
were agreed to subsequent cash 
receipts or payments, including 
examination of a sample of payments 
to assess whether they had been 
properly included or excluded from the 
balance sheet; and the merchant 
creditor balance was agreed to actual 
bank settlement activity after the 
year-end.
  Other key substantive procedures over 
settlement balances included selecting 
a sample of payments on the first day 
subsequent to the year-end, for which 
we obtained remittances in order to 
assess whether they were properly 
included or excluded from the reported 
liability, and inspecting contracts and 
settlement activity for a sample of the 
largest merchants in order to assess 
whether the transactions were 
processed and recorded in the correct 
period. These procedures provided 
evidence in respect of the classification 
between settlement funds and own 
cash on the balance sheet.
  Financial statement disclosures: We 
also assessed whether the Group’s 
disclosures in respect of revenue 
recognition and settlement accounts 
provided sufficient detail for users to 
understand the nature of settlement 
transactions.
Valuation of Visa Europe membership 
shares (‘VE shares’) (£195.7m) and related 
Contingent Value Rights (‘CVRs’) 
(£140.9m)
Refer to page 89 (Audit Committee 
statement), pages 154 and 155 (accounting 
policy and financial disclosure).
 The risk
VE shares and CVRs are financial 
instruments (VE shares being a financial 
asset and CVRs being a financial liability 
for the Group). The carrying value of these 
financial instruments is dependent upon 
the classification of those financial 
instruments on initial recognition, and 
subsequently upon the latest available 
information and the Directors’ judgements 
at each reporting date. The CVRs are a 
financial liability that is recognised initially 
at fair value, and subsequently at 
amortised cost, with any changes being 
recorded in the Consolidated Income 
Statement. The VE shares are a financial 
asset and the Directors have designated 
them as at fair value through profit or loss, 
therefore the VE shares will be measured 
at fair value at each reporting period with 
any changes being recorded in the 
Consolidated income statement.
  VE sh a r e s : There is no current active 
market for the shares and therefore 
these instruments fall within level 3 of 
the fair value hierarchy which requires 
significant judgement in determining 
fair value. The Directors are required to 
construct a valuation model that 
considers the potential cash flows for 
a range of possible outcomes. Due to 
the potentially large range of 
outcomes in value terms, there is a 
high level of judgement required and 
therefore there is a risk of material 
misstatement in the valuation of this 
financial asset.
  C VRs : The measurement of the CVRs at 
amortised cost requires the Directors 
to estimate the future cash flows 
related to the instrument. Similar to the 
VE shares above, there is a large range 
of potential outcomes in value terms, 
and therefore there is a risk of material 
misstatement in the carrying value of 
this financial liability.
Our response
  V E s h a r e s : Our audit procedures 
included, amongst others, an 
assessment of the facts and 
circumstances and rights and 
obligations attached to the instrument 
against the accounting literature, and 
consideration of a range of possible 
alternatives with respect to 
classification and valuation of the 
instrument.
  We compared the key input 
assumptions within the Directors’ 
valuation model to externally and 
internally derived data as well as our 
own assessments. Key inputs included 
the likelihood of a transaction between 
Visa Inc. and Visa Europe occurring, the 
value and form of possible 
consideration for the VE shares, the 
nature of potential clawbacks arising 
from Visa Europe contingent liabilities, 
and the applicable risk, discount 
factors and likelihood applied to each 
possible outcome. We considered the 
correlation between the information 
obtained and the judgements made by 
the Directors and evaluated the 
consistency of the judgements made 
by the Directors with the relevant 
International Financial Reporting 
Standards. We utilised our own 
valuations specialists to support our 
challenge of the Directors’ key 
judgements. Our assessment included 
consideration of the potential risk of 
management bias. We gathered 
internal and external information in 
relation to both the characteristics of, 
and the demand for, these instruments. 
We also considered contradictory or 
disconfirming evidence as relevant 
information.

Worldpay Group plc
Annual Report and Accounts 2015  Sensitivity analysis was performed in  
 order to assess the reasonableness of  
 the assumptions applied by management  
 in arriving at the expected cash flows.
   C VRs : Our audit procedures included, 
amongst others, an assessment of the 
facts and circumstances and rights and 
obligations attached to the instrument 
against the accounting literature, and 
consideration of a range of possible 
alternatives with respect to classification 
and measurement of the instrument.
   We obtained the calculation of the 
carrying amount of the CVRs provided 
by the Group and assessed the 
appropriateness of the inputs into the 
calculation, recalculated the key 
components of the calculation and 
considered whether the methodology 
applied was consistent with the 
definition of amortised cost under IFRS 
(as adopted by the EU).
  The key input into the calculation was 
the forecast future cash flows in relation 
to the CVRs. As the CVRs represent 90% 
of the net post tax proceeds from a sale 
of the VE shares, the future cash flows 
of the CVRs are intrinsically linked to 
the VE shares and therefore the 
assumptions applied are similar. 
 Sensitivity analysis was performed in  
 order to assess the reasonableness of  
 the assumptions applied by management
 in arriving at the expected cash flows.
   F i n a nc i a l s t a t e m e nt d i s c l o s u re s : We 
also assessed the adequacy of the 
Group’s disclosures in respect of the fair 
value hierarchy and sensitivities.
 Completeness of trade receivables 
impairment provisions (£38.0m) and  
MPL (£0.1m)
Refer to page 90 (Audit Committee 
statement), page 126 (accounting policy) 
and pages 143 to 145 (financial disclosure). 
The risk
Worldpay support over 400,000 
merchants, most of which are small and 
medium sized, which makes the 
assessment of impairment of trade 
receivables inherently difficult to track. 
Reporting capabilities are limited for 
certain IT systems in the Group which 
makes it difficult to obtain up to date, 
complete and relevant data required to 
monitor and manage collections across 
the entire merchant portfolio, and 
therefore to reliably assess potential 
exposure and the resulting provision 
requirement. 
Provisions are made in respect of 
impairment of trade receivables where 
there is objective evidence that the Group 
cannot recover the original expected cash 
flows from the trade receivable due to 
events since the trade receivable was 
initially recognised. 
In addition, the Group also bears the risk 
of recoverability of gross cardholder 
transaction amounts due from a merchant 
that arise from a chargeback being raised 
by a cardholder (i.e. a claim from a 
cardholder where the payment has been 
made but the merchant has failed to 
deliver the goods or services). The Group 
refer to this as the Merchant Potential 
Liability (‘MPL ’) exposure. 
With regards to MPL, significant 
judgement is required in assessing the risk 
of future chargebacks being raised in 
respect of payments that have already 
been processed and the recoverability of 
those amounts from merchants, for 
example due to bankruptcy or other 
merchant failure.
Our response
Our audit procedures included, amongst 
others, assessment of the design and 
operating effectiveness of key manual 
controls within the Group’s merchant 
onboarding and ongoing monitoring 
processes. 
 Our procedures to assess the accuracy of 
the bad debt provision included 
consideration of cash collection from 
merchants subsequent to the year-end. 
We deducted post year-end cash 
collections during the period of our testing 
from the year-end trade receivables 
amount, and critically assessed the 
adequacy of the bad debt provision 
against the remaining outstanding 
receivable. Where amounts remain unpaid, 
we evaluated the Directors’ judgements 
on recoverability, taking into account 
specific customer circumstances known 
to the Directors, and publicly available 
data on liquidations and insolvencies post 
year-end.
With respect to MPL our procedures 
included a critical assessment of the 
output of the Group’s internal monitoring 
and review processes, focusing, in 
particular, on industries where there is a 
delay between a cardholder paying for a 
good or service and when that good or 
service is delivered by the merchant.  
We obtained copies of publicly available 
industry outlook reports in order to assess 
the Directors’ judgements in respect of 
amounts recorded for potential 
chargebacks that may not be recoverable 
from merchants. Where a specific risk was 
identified for a particular merchant, we 
evaluated the Directors’ judgements on 
potential exposure and recoverability, 
taking into account specific customer 
circumstances known to the Directors 
and publicly available information on the 
financial performance of that merchant. In 
addition, we considered publicly available 
data on liquidations and insolvencies post 
year-end. 
  Financial statement disclosures: We 
also assessed the adequacy of the 
Group’s disclosure about significant 
judgements in relation to trade 
receivables impairment provisions  
and MPL.

  3 Our application of materiality and an 
overview of the scope of our audit
The materiality for the Group financial 
statements as a whole was set at £20m, 
determined with reference to a 
benchmark of total revenues of £3,963.0m 
of which it represents 0.5%. We consider 
revenue to be the most appropriate 
benchmark as it provides a more stable 
measure year-on-year than Group profit 
before tax at this point in the Group’s 
development after separation from RBS 
and given its capital structure pre-IPO.
We report to the Audit Committee any 
corrected or uncorrected identified 
misstatements exceeding £1m, in addition 
to other identified misstatements that 
warranted reporting on qualitative 
grounds. 
Of the Group’s 31 reporting components, 
we subjected four to audits for Group 
reporting purposes and two to specified 
risk-focused audit procedures. The 
components for which we performed 
specified risk-focused procedures were 
not individually financially significant 
enough to require an audit for Group 
reporting purposes, but did include 
specific individual risks that needed to be 
addressed. The Group team also 
performed audit work over interest and 
finance cost-related account balances as 
part of the audit of the Group 
consolidation. The audits of the four 
reporting components and the work 
performed on the Group consolidation 
covered 96% of total Group revenue; 83% 
of total profits and losses that made up 
the Group profit before tax; and 92% of 
total Group assets; and 58% of total Group 
liabilities. 
The specified risk-focused procedures 
covered 4% of total Group assets (relating 
to settlement balances) and 39% of total 
Group liabilities (relating to the borrowings 
as shown on page 148). The aggregate 
coverage achieved was 96% of total Group 
revenue; 83% of total profits and losses 
that made up the Group profit before tax; 
96% of total Group assets; and 97% of 
total Group liabilities. The remaining 
17% of total Group profit before tax is 
represented by 27 reporting components, 
none of which individually represented 
more than 4% of Group profit before tax. 
For these remaining components, we 
performed analysis at an aggregated 
Group level to re-examine our assessment 
that there were no significant risks of 
material misstatement within these.
The Group audit team instructed 
component auditors as to the significant 
areas to be covered, and the information 
to be reported. The Group audit team 
approved the component materialities, 
which ranged from £8m to £15m, having 
regard to the mix of size and risk profile of 
the Group across the components. The 
work on one of the four components was 
performed by a component auditor and 
the rest by the Group audit team.
The Group audit team visited the 
component auditor in the United States, 
including an assessment of the audit risk 
and strategy, and telephone meetings 
were held with the component auditor 
throughout the year. At these visits and 
meetings, the Group audit team also 
discussed the findings reported in more 
detail and assessed the adequacy of the 
work performed by the component 
auditor.
4 Our opinion on other matters prescribed 
by the Companies Act 2006 is unmodified
In our opinion: 
   The part of the Directors’ remuneration 
report to be audited has been properly 
prepared in accordance with the 
Companies Act 2006; and
   The information given in the Strategic 
report and the Directors’ report for the 
financial year for which the financial 
statements are prepared is consistent 
with the financial statements; and 
   The information given in the Corporate 
governance statement set out on page 
95 with respect to internal control and 
risk management systems in relation to 
financial reporting processes and about 
share capital structures is consistent 
with the financial statements. 
5 We have nothing to report on the 
disclosures of principal risks
Based on the knowledge we acquired 
during our audit, we have nothing material 
to add or draw attention to in relation to: 
   The Directors’ statement of principal 
risks and uncertainties on pages 55 to 
66, concerning the principal risks, their 
management, and, based on that, the 
Directors’ assessment and expectations 
of the Group’s continuing in operation 
over the three years to 2018; or 
   The disclosures in Note 1 of the Financial 
statements concerning the use of the 
going concern basis of accounting. 
6 We have nothing to report in respect of 
the matters on which we are required to 
report by exception 
Under ISAs (UK and Ireland) we are 
required to report to you if, based on the 
knowledge we acquired during our audit, 
we have identified other information in the 
Annual Report that contains a material 
inconsistency with either that knowledge 
or the Financial statements, a material 
misstatement of fact, or that is otherwise 
misleading. 
In particular, we are required to report to 
you if: 
   We have identified material 
inconsistencies between the 
knowledge we acquired during our audit 
and the Directors’ statement that they 
consider that the Annual report and 
financial statements taken as a whole is 
fair, balanced and understandable and 
provides the information necessary for 
shareholders to assess the Group’s 
performance, business model and 
strategy; or
   The Audit Committee report does not 
appropriately address matters 
communicated by us to the Audit 
Committee.

Consolidated cash flow statement
For the year ended 31 December 2015 Note 1a
The Company was incorporated and registered in England and 
Wales on 5 November 2013 under the Companies Act 2006 as a 
private company limited by shares with the name Ship Blackjack 
Limited. On 3 July 2015, the Company changed its name to Ship 
Group Limited and subsequently, on 29 July 2015, it changed 
its name again to Worldpay Group Limited. The Company was 
re-registered as a public limited company under the name 
Worldpay Group plc on 30 September 2015.
On 16 October 2015, the Company’s shares were admitted to 
the London Stock Exchange through a placing of 1,035,000,000 
Ordinary Shares of £0.03 each.
The Group’s consolidated financial statements include those 
of the Company and its subsidiaries (together referred to as 
the ‘Group’) and equity accounts the Group’s interest in joint 
ventures and associates. 
On 3 July 2015, the Company changed its financial year end 
from 30 November to 31 December. As a result, the comparative 
period to these financial statements is 1 December 2014 to 
31 December 2014.
To aid comparability and understanding of performance, however, 
management has also presented pro forma comparative 
information for the 12 months to 31 December 2014.
The consolidated financial statements for all periods have been 
prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting 
Standards as adopted by the European Union (‘IFRS’). 
The financial statements are presented in Sterling which is the 
Company’s functional currency. All information is given to the 
nearest one hundred thousand pounds. 
The financial statements are prepared on the historical cost basis 
except for the derivative financial instruments and the Group’s 
membership stake in Visa Europe, which are stated at their fair value.
On 12 December 2013, the Company acquired all of the issued 
share capital of Ship Luxco 2 S.à r.l. and its subsidiaries. The 
acquisition has been accounted for using the principles of 
reverse acquisition accounting. Therefore when preparing the 
financial statements, it has been assumed that the Company 
has always been the ultimate parent Company of the Group.
The Group includes a column for separately disclosed items 
on the face of its consolidated income statement. Separately 
disclosed items are costs or income that have been recognised 
in the income statement which the Directors believe due to 
their nature or size, should be disclosed separately to give a 
more comparable view of the year-on-year underlying 
trading performance. They are presented in their relevant 
income statement category, but highlighted through separate 
disclosure. 
Net revenue, which is defined as revenue less interchange and 
scheme fees, is presented on the face of the income statement 
as the Directors believe that this best reflects the relationship 
between revenue and profitability.
The Group’s cash flow statement is presented excluding 
merchant float. Merchant float represents surplus cash 
balances that the Group holds on behalf of its customers when 
the incoming amount from the card schemes or networks 
precedes when the funding to customers falls due.
The funds are held in a fiduciary capacity and cannot be utilised 
by the Group to fund its own cash requirements. The merchant 
float is also subject to significant period by period fluctuations 
depending on the day of the week a period end falls. For these 
reasons, the Directors have excluded the merchant float from 
the cash flow statement to allow a better understanding of the 
Group’s underlying own cash flows.
Going concern
The Group has made losses in 2015, primarily due to finance costs 
incurred on the Group’s external borrowings. As at year-end, the 
Group was in a net asset position of £671.1m (2014: net liability 
position of £192.1m).
In considering the going concern basis for preparing the financial 
statements, the Board have reviewed the Group’s trading forecasts 
for the next 12 months. These forecasts, which include detailed 
cash flow projections, comprise assumptions as to sales and profit 
performance by business unit and by month. It demonstrates the 
Group’s ability to operate within its current borrowing facilities.
Notwithstanding the above, however, there remains a risk that a 
downturn in the economy could result in the Group’s sales and 
profits being worse than the Board is currently envisaging.
As a result, the Directors have also reviewed forecasts which 
include sensitivities that make allowance for this risk. Should such 
a scenario arise the Directors are confident they have adequate 
liquidity and covenant headroom to ensure that the Group can 
meet its liabilities as they fall due for the foreseeable future.
Accordingly, the Directors believe that it is appropriate to prepare 
these financial statements on a going concern basis.
This section sets out the accounting policies of Worldpay 
Group plc and its subsidiaries (the ‘Group’ and the ‘Worldpay 
Group’) that relate to the financial statements as a whole. 
Where an accounting policy is specific to one note, the policy 
is described in the note to which it relates. 
This section also details new accounting standards that 
have been endorsed in the period and have either become 
effective in 2015 or will become effective in later periods.

Notes to the consolidated financial statements
Section 1 – Basis of preparation Note 1a (continued)
Accounting policies
Foreign exchange
The consolidated financial statements of the Worldpay Group 
are presented in Sterling, which is the functional currency of the 
Company and the presentational currency of the Group.
The net assets of foreign subsidiaries are translated to Sterling 
as follows:
  The assets and liabilities of the entity (including goodwill and 
fair value adjustments on acquisition) are translated at the rate 
prevailing at the end of the reporting period.
  Income and expenses are translated at the rate ruling on the 
date of the transaction or an appropriate average rate.
  Equity elements are translated at the date of the transaction 
and not retranslated in subsequent periods.
All exchange differences arising on consolidation are taken 
through other comprehensive income to the Foreign Currency 
Translation Reserve.
Foreign currency transactions are initially recorded at the rate 
ruling on the date of the transaction. At the end of each reporting 
period, foreign currency items on the balance sheet are 
translated as follows:
  Non-monetary items, including equity, held at historic cost are 
not retranslated.
  Non-monetary items held at fair value are translated at the 
rate ruling on the date the fair value was determined.
  Monetary items are retranslated at the rate prevailing at the 
end of the reporting period.
Foreign exchange gains and losses arising from the retranslation 
of foreign currency transactions are recognised in the income 
statement.
Netting
The Group is party to a number of arrangements, including 
master netting agreements, that give it the right to offset 
financial assets and financial liabilities. 
Where it does not intend to settle the amounts net or 
simultaneously, the assets and liabilities concerned are 
presented gross.
Own shares held in Employee Benefit Trust (‘EBT’)
The consideration for any Ordinary Shares of the Company held 
by the EBT is deducted from equity attributable to the owners of 
the Company until the shares are cancelled or reissued.
On the sale or reissue of these shares the consideration received 
is credited to equity, net of any directly attributable incremental 
costs and related tax.
The EBT purchases the Group’s shares in order to hedge the cash 
outflow upon the exercise of a share option or a share award.
Accounting developments
Impact of new accounting standards
There have been no new or amended accounting standards 
that have been adopted by the Group in the year ended 
31 December 2015.
New standards and interpretations not yet adopted
The following standards are in issue but not yet effective and 
have not been adopted by the Group: 
  IFRS 9 ‘Financial Instruments’ (2009 and 2010) – not yet 
endorsed by the European Union. It will eventually replace 
IAS 39 but currently only details the requirements for 
recognition and measurement of financial assets. 
  IFRS 15 ‘Revenue from Contracts with Customer’ – replaces 
IAS 18 ‘Revenues’, and introduces a five-step approach to 
revenue recognition based on performance obligations in 
customer contracts. The International Accounting Standards 
Board (‘IASB’) has proposed to issue some clarifications and 
to defer the standard’s effective date of 1 January 2017 to 
1 January 2018. The effective date for the Group is also subject 
to European Union endorsement.
  Amendment to IAS 1 on presentation of financial statements. 
The effective date for the Group is also subject to European 
Union endorsement.
  Amendment to IAS 16 ‘Property, plant and equipment’ and 
IAS 38 ‘Intangible assets’ on depreciation and amortisation.
  Annual Improvements to IFRSs: 2012-14 Cycle.
The Group has not completed its assessment of the impact of 
these pronouncements but the implementation of these new 
standards is not expected to have a material impact on the 
consolidated results, financial position or cash flows of the Group.
Note 1b
Critical accounting estimates and judgements
The reported results of the Group for the financial year ended 
31 December 2015 are sensitive to the accounting policies, 
assumptions and estimates that underlie the preparation of 
its financial statements. 
The judgements and assumptions involved in the Group’s 
accounting policies that are considered by the Directors to be 
the most important to the portrayal of its financial condition 
are discussed below. 
The use of estimates, assumptions or models that differ from 
those adopted by the Group would affect its reported results.

  Note 1b (continued)
Fair value of derivatives and other financial instruments
The fair value of financial instruments that are not traded in an 
active market is determined by using valuation techniques that 
take into consideration market inputs such as interest rates 
and volatility.
Fair value of Visa Europe asset and related Contingent 
Value Rights (‘CVRs’)
As at 30 June 2015 and on IPO completion, the Visa Europe asset 
was recognised in the Group’s balance sheet as a FVTPL financial 
asset with a fair value of £nil. In accordance with IAS 39, financial 
assets should be re-measured at each reporting date. In performing 
the revaluation at 31 December 2015, the offer by Visa Inc. to 
purchase Visa Europe has been taken into account in the 
subsequent measure of fair value, despite the fact that there 
remains some uncertainty around both the likelihood of 
completion of the deal (which is still subject to anti-trust 
clearance), and the amount of pre-transaction operational 
liabilities which could reduce the up-front consideration received.
In order to fair value the financial asset as at 31 December 2015, 
the Directors have considered a range of potential outcomes 
and calculated a weighted average, considering the likelihood 
of various factors, including the expected likelihood of the 
transaction completing, the likely value of the potential level 
of Visa Europe liabilities that the Group may be liable for and 
the timing of cash flows.
The CVR liabilities were recognised at £nil fair value on 
initial recognition. At year end, they were re-measured based on 
a re-estimation of future cash flows, with any changes in 
value being recognised in the income statement.
The weighted average of the outcomes was discounted to reflect 
the time value of money. Sensitivity analysis has been performed 
on key assumptions used in the valuation.
Income and deferred taxes
The Group’s tax charge on ordinary activities is the sum of the 
total current and deferred tax charges calculated by reference to 
the legal requirements applying to each jurisdiction in which the 
Group operates. 
As an integral part of this process, the Group applies its 
judgement in order to determine the tax charge applying to those 
matters for which the final tax treatment is considered by the 
Group to be uncertain.
Where the final tax outcome of these matters is different from 
the amounts that were initially recorded, such differences are 
recognised in the period in which such determination is made. 
Trade receivable impairment provisions
A trade receivable is impaired when there is objective evidence 
that, due to events since the trade receivable was created, the 
Group cannot recover the original expected cash flows from the 
trade receivable. Trade receivable impairment provisions can be 
either bad debt provisions or merchant potential liability provisions.
A bad debt provision represents the difference between the 
carrying value of the trade receivable and the present value of 
estimated future cash flows.
A merchant potential liability provision is required when a 
merchant goes into liquidation or bankruptcy and the Group is 
exposed to potential chargebacks. Judgement is necessary to 
assess the likelihood that a pending claim will succeed, or a 
liability will arise and to quantify the possible range of any 
financial settlement. 
Separate disclosure of profits and losses in the consolidated 
income statement
Separately disclosed items are costs or income that are 
recognised in the income statement which the Directors believe, 
due to their size or nature, are not the result of normal operating 
performance. They are therefore separately disclosed on the face 
of the income statement to allow a more comparable view of 
underlying trading performance.
Capitalisation of software development costs
Development costs that are directly attributable to the design 
and testing of identifiable and unique software products 
controlled by the Group are recognised as intangible assets. 
These costs include directly attributable employee costs. 
However, any costs incurred in the research phase or as 
maintenance are expensed as incurred.
The Directors monitor the costs incurred and capitalised on 
an ongoing basis. Any impairment identified is written off to 
the income statement.
Whilst not considered to be a critical accounting estimate or 
judgement, revenue recognition and presentation of settlement 
assets and liabilities is considered to be a critical accounting 
policy. Refer to Section 2 for further details.

Annual Report and Accounts 2015 Accounting policies
Revenue recognition  
Revenue represents the consideration received or receivable 
from the merchants for services provided. Key revenue streams 
that the Group reports are:
Transaction service charges relate to services provided to 
process transactions between the customer and an acquiring 
bank, which is a bank that accepts card payments from the 
card-issuing banks. Revenue is recognised when the transactions 
are successfully processed and is recognised per transaction.
Terminal rental fees are due from terminal lessees. Revenue is 
recognised on a straight-line basis over the terms of the lease 
agreements.
Income from treasury management and foreign exchange 
services is generated on settling foreign currency transactions 
on behalf of customers. Revenue is recognised when the Group’s 
obligation in relation to the transaction is fulfilled.
Ancillary income includes fees charged per transaction for 
providing gateway services, fraud and risk management 
services, float income, and charges levied for the acceptance 
of alternative payments. Gateway services work in the same 
manner as transaction processing services, but are provided 
for online transactions only. Local and alternative payment 
services allow merchants to accept payments worldwide 
which do not directly involve a credit or debit card. Revenue is 
recognised when the transactions are successfully processed.
Costs of sales which primarily consist of fees charged by card 
schemes (scheme fees) as well as acquiring banks (interchange 
fees), are matched to the revenue generated and are recognised 
when incurred.
Net revenue is revenue after deducting scheme fees and 
interchange fees. Other cost of sales are recognised in the period 
to which they relate. 
Items paid in advance or invoiced in arrears are shown as 
prepayments or accruals, as appropriate, on the balance sheet 
at the end of the period.
Note 2a
Segmental information
IFRS 8 requires operating segments to be identified on the basis 
of internal reports about components of the Group that are 
regularly reviewed by the Chief Operating Decision Maker (the 
Executive Committee) to allocate resources and assess 
performance. For each identified operating segment, the Group 
has disclosed information for the key performance indicators 
that are assessed internally to review and steer performance in 
the Operating review included in the Strategic report.
The Group reports four segments: Global eCom, WPUK, 
WPUS and Corporate. Further details about the three trading 
segments can be found in the Operating review on pages 67 to 
70. Corporate principally contains central personnel costs and 
consultancy spend.

Separately disclosed items
Separately disclosed items are costs or income that have been recognised in the income statement which the Directors believe, due 
to their nature or size, should be disclosed separately to give a more comparable view of the year-on-year underlying financial 
performance. They are presented in their relevant income statement category, but highlighted through separate disclosure. The 
following table gives further details of the items included.

Separately disclosed items in the year amounted to a net cost of £169.0m (2014: £179.9m), of which £103.7m (2014: £88.6m) affected EBITDA, 
£69.9m (2014: £82.7m) affected depreciation and amortisation and a net gain of £4.6m (2014: cost of £8.6m) affected finance costs. 
The separately disclosed items affecting EBITDA comprise platform-related and other costs incurred in the separation from RBS; 
non-capitalisable costs of the IPO; reorganisation and restructuring costs; and other costs. 
Platform-related separation costs of £33.3m (2014: £35.1m) are non-capitalised costs associated with the upgrade and migration 
of the Group’s core systems from RBS. They are principally personnel, maintenance and consultancy costs. Total costs incurred to 
date on the platform programme are £449.8m (2014: £361.9m), of which £289.4m (2014: £234.8m) has been included within tangible 
and intangible assets on the balance sheet, with the remainder charged directly to the income statement.
Other costs related to the separation from RBS of £20.1m (2014: £24.1m) principally relate to system implementation and 
remediation, double running of property, and the excess costs of interim staff.
The non-capitalisable costs of the IPO in the year amounted to £35.0m (2014: £nil) and reflect the costs of various share award programmes 
that were put in place as part of the IPO, including the all-employee free share award and additional awards given to management.
Reorganisation and restructuring costs of £6.4m (2014 £18.2m) represent costs associated with a variety of projects to develop and 
implement the strategy of establishing Worldpay as a stand-alone business. Costs in 2015 include the restructuring and further 
integration of the Cardsave business in WPUK and the sales force reorganisation in WPUS. These are partially offset by the release of 
provisions for contingent consideration no longer required.

Section 2 – Results for the period

Separately disclosed items (continued)
Other costs of £8.9m (2014: £11.2m) include fees payable to shareholders incurred prior to the IPO in relation to the previous 
ownership structure and a number of other smaller one-off items.
Separately disclosed items affecting depreciation and amortisation amounted to £69.9m (2014: £82.7m). This predominantly relates 
to the amortisation of business combination intangibles which is a non-cash charge relating to intangible assets recognised on 
the divestment of the business from RBS, as well as subsequent strategic business acquisitions. In addition, in the year, software 
development in WPUS of £2.0m was deemed to be impaired and written off following the integration of the SecureNet business.
Separately disclosed items affecting finance costs in the year were a net gain of £4.6m (2014: cost of £8.6m) and comprise costs 
associated with the refinancing of the Group (£44.7m), a net revaluation gain on the Visa Europe shares and related Contingent Value 
Rights (£54.8m), and FX losses resulting from the translation of the Group’s assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other 
than Sterling (£5.5m). The £44.7m of costs associated with the refinancing represent the write-off of capitalised finance costs on 
repayment of the debt that was in place prior to the IPO.
The net revaluation gain on the Visa Europe shares and related Contingent Value Rights is discussed in more detail in Note 5i.
The tax credit of £0.8m arising on separately disclosed items (2014: £38.2m) includes a deferred tax charge of £39.2m arising on the 
proposed disposal of the interest in Visa Europe in 2016.
Note 2c 
Personnel expenses
Expenses related to services rendered by employees are recognised in the period in which the service is rendered. This includes wages 
and salaries, social security contributions, pension contributions, bonuses and termination benefits.
Where payments of amounts due are outstanding at the end of the reporting period, an accrual is recognised. Where payments have 
been made in advance prior to the end of the reporting period, a prepayment is recognised.
The Group operates defined contribution pension schemes. The amounts charged to the profit and loss account in respect of pension 
costs and other post-retirement benefits are the contributions payable in the period. Differences between contributions payable in the 
period and contributions actually paid are shown as either accruals or prepayments on the balance sheet.
Share-based payments
Equity-settled share-based payments are measured at fair value at the date of grant. The fair value determined at the grant date of the 
equity-settled share-based payments is expensed on a straight line basis over the vesting period, based upon estimation of the shares will 
eventually vest, with a corresponding increase in equity. Fair value is measured by reference to the market value of the Group’s shares, 
adjusted as necessary for the terms and conditions of the award, or an appropriate option pricing model, depending on the nature of 
the award.
All employee share award
Following a successful IPO, the Group made a one-off award of shares to all employees who joined the Group prior to 1 July 2015 and 
were still under employment at the date of the IPO. The award was granted on 18 September 2015. Given the short period between the 
grant date and the vesting date (i.e. the IPO date on 16 October 2015), it has been considered that the fair value at grant date would not 
be materially different from the fair value at the vesting date. Total expenses recognised in the Group’s income statement are £12.6m.
 
Phantom share award
Certain employees were granted a cash-settled award scheme which was settled in the year. Total expenses recognised in the Group’s 
income statement is £16.7m.
 
Transitional award
On the date of the IPO, the Group granted a transitional share award plan to certain members of the senior management team. Shares 
will be given to eligible employees three years after the date of grant, subject to satisfaction of the minimum shareholding requirement 
and continued employment. An expense of £1.2m was recognised in the Group’s income statement in 2015.

Tax
Tax on the profit or loss for the year comprises current and deferred tax. Current tax, including all applicable UK and foreign taxes, is 
the expected tax payable on the taxable income for the year, using tax rates and bases of calculation which have been enacted or 
substantively enacted in the applicable jurisdiction for the current accounting period, together with any necessary adjustments to tax 
payable in respect of previous accounting periods. Current tax is recognised in the income statement unless it arises from a 
transaction recognised directly in equity, in which case the associated tax is also recognised directly in equity. Relief for foreign 
taxation in calculating UK taxation liabilities is taken into account where appropriate.

Deferred tax
Deferred tax is provided on temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting 
purposes and the amounts used for taxation purposes.
The following temporary differences are not provided for: the initial recognition of goodwill; the initial recognition of assets or liabilities 
that affect neither accounting nor taxable profit other than in a business combination; and differences relating to investments in 
subsidiaries to the extent that they will probably not reverse in the foreseeable future. The amount of deferred tax provided is based 
on the expected manner of realisation or settlement of the carrying amount of assets and liabilities, using tax rates enacted or 
substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
A deferred tax asset is recognised only to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which the 
temporary difference can be utilised.
Deferred tax charges and credits are recognised in the income statement unless they arise from a transaction recognised directly in 
equity, in which case the associated deferred tax is also recognised directly in equity.

Note 2j
Earnings per share
Basic earnings/(loss) per share amounts are calculated by dividing the profit/(loss) attributable to owners of the parent by the 
weighted average number of Ordinary Shares in issue during the financial period.
Diluted earnings/(loss) per share amounts are calculated by dividing the profit/(loss) attributable to owners of the parent by the 
weighted average number of Ordinary Shares in issue during the financial period adjusted for the effects of potentially dilutive options. 
The dilutive effect is calculated on the full exercise of all potentially dilutive Ordinary Share options granted by the Group, 
including performance-based options which the Group considers to have been earned.
When a loss is recognised during a financial period, a basic loss per share rather than a basic earnings per share will be recognised. 
The dilutive effects will not be considered in calculating the diluted loss per share as this would reduce the loss per share.
The weighted average number of shares used to determine earnings per share have been calculated in accordance with the principle 
of reverse acquisition accounting.
Underlying basic and diluted earnings per share are included as the Directors believe this provides a better reflection of the 
Group’s performance.

Goodwill
Goodwill arising on the acquisition of a business represents any excess of the fair value of the consideration given over the fair value of 
the identifiable assets and liabilities acquired, less any non-controlling interest. Goodwill is carried at the cost established at the date 
of acquisition of the business less accumulated impairment losses, if any, and is not amortised.

Determining whether goodwill is impaired requires an estimation of the value in use of the cash-generating units (‘CGU’) to which 
goodwill has been allocated. The value in use calculation is performed at least annually and requires the Directors to estimate the 
future cash flows expected to arise from the CGU and a suitable discount rate in order to calculate present value.
The corporate planning process includes the preparation of the annual budget as well as the Group’s long-term strategic plan. 
The strategic plan provides medium to long-term direction for the Group and is reviewed on an annual basis. It includes a five-year 
outlook for the business including management’s view on the future achievable growth in market share and the capital expenditure 
required to achieve it. The cash flows included in the strategic plan are used for the value in use calculations.
Key assumptions used in the value in use calculation are:
Average 
growth rate  
in sales
Average 
growth rate  
in costs
Terminal 
growth rate Discount rate
31 December 2015 5.3-16.9% 2.6-12.5% 2.0% 8.0-10.0%
31 December 2014 7.0-17.3% 3.3-18.2% 2.0% 10.6-11.5%
The sensitivity of goodwill carrying values to reasonably possible changes in key assumptions has been performed. No changes 
produce a significant movement in the carrying value of goodwill allocated to a CGU and therefore no sensitivity analysis is presented.
Should the value in use be lower than the carrying value, the resultant impairment loss is first allocated to goodwill, then to remaining 
assets of the CGU pro rata based on their carrying amount. No asset is impaired below its own recoverable amount. The impairment 
loss is recognised immediately in separately disclosed items in the income statement. Impairment losses on goodwill cannot be 
reversed in subsequent periods.

Other intangible assets
Intangibles assets acquired in a business combination and recognised separately from goodwill include brands and customer 
relationships. These are initially recognised at their fair value at the acquisition date. Subsequently, they are reported at cost less 
accumulated amortisation and impairment losses, if any. 
Amortisation is recognised on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful economic life. The estimated useful economic lives and 
the amortisation method are reviewed at the end of each reporting period, with any changes being accounted for on a prospective 
basis. 
The useful lives applied by the Group are:
Customer relationships  3 to 20 years
Brands    3 to 25 years
Development costs that are directly attributable to the design and testing of identifiable and unique software products controlled by 
the Group are recognised as intangible assets. These costs include directly attributable employee costs. However, any costs incurred 
in the research phase or as maintenance are expensed as incurred.
Computer software is amortised over its useful life which is three to ten years.

Property, plant and equipment
Property, plant and equipment includes terminals, leasehold improvements and computers and office equipment.
Property, plant and equipment is initially recognised at cost. Cost includes all expenditure directly attributable to bringing the asset to 
the location and working condition for its intended use. Subsequent measurement of property, plant and equipment is at cost less 
accumulated depreciation and impairment losses.
Subsequent expenditure is capitalised only when it is probable that it will give rise to future benefits, i.e. maintenance expenditure is 
excluded but enhancement costs may be included. 
Property, plant and equipment is depreciated to its residual value over its useful life on a straight-line basis. Estimates of the useful life 
and residual value, as well as the method of depreciation, are reviewed as a minimum at the end of each reporting period. Any changes 
are classified as a change in accounting estimate and so are applied prospectively.
Depreciation rates for each category of property, plant and equipment are as follows:
Terminals   one to five years
Leasehold improvements  five to twenty years
Computers and office equipment three to five years 
Depreciation begins when the asset is ready for use and ceases on disposal of the asset, classification as held for sale or the end of its 
useful life, whichever is the sooner.
The gain or loss on disposal is the difference between the net proceeds received and the carrying amount of the asset.

Impairment of non-current assets
The Group assesses its other intangible assets and property, plant and equipment for indicators of impairment at least annually.  
If such indicators exist, the recoverable amount of the asset or its cash-generating unit, if the asset does not generate largely 
independent cash flows, is estimated. The recoverable amount is the higher of the fair value less costs of disposal and the value  
in use. Value in use is the present value of the future cash flows from the asset or the cash-generating unit, discounted at the 
appropriate pre-tax rate. 
The Group recognises any impairment loss resulting from these reviews in separately disclosed items in the income statement. 
Impairment losses, except those arising on goodwill, may be reversed in subsequent periods. However, the revised carrying value of 
the asset may not exceed the carrying value had the original impairment not arisen.
An exercise was undertaken to ascertain whether any of the Platform assets were impaired. This review resulted in an impairment loss 
of £nil (2014: £9.6m) which has been included within separately disclosed items.

Merchant float, scheme debtors and merchant creditors
Merchant float, scheme debtors and merchant creditors represent intermediary balances arising in the merchant settlement 
process. 
Merchant float represents surplus cash balances that the Group holds on behalf of its customers, when the incoming amount from 
the card schemes or networks precedes when the funding to customers falls due. The funds are held in a fiduciary capacity. They are 
excluded from the Group cash flow statement to provide greater clarity over the Group’s own cash movements.
Scheme debtors consist primarily of:
  The Group’s receivables from the card schemes or networks for transactions processed on behalf of customers, where it is a 
member of that particular scheme or network; 
  The Group’s receivables from the card schemes or networks for transactions where it has (by exception) funded customers in 
advance of receipt of card association funding; and
  Other net receivables from the schemes.
Merchant creditors consist primarily of:
  The Group’s liability to customers for transactions that have been processed but not yet funded by the card schemes or networks, 
where it is a member of that particular scheme or network; 
  The Group’s liability to the customers for transactions for which it is holding funding from the members under the sponsorship 
agreement but has not funded customers on behalf of the members; and
  Merchant reserves and the fair value of the Group’s guarantees of cardholder chargebacks. These are amounts held as deposits 
from customers, either from inception of Worldpay’s working relationship with them, or accrued throughout the relationship due to 
payment issues arising or potential chargebacks.
Note 4b
Inventory
The Group’s inventory consists of terminals held for sale of £0.4m (2014: £1.3m). Inventory is measured at the lower of cost and net 
realisable value. Net realisable value is reassessed at each reporting date. Cost is based on the weighted average cost of the items 
held in stock, calculated monthly. 
Any write down to net realisable value is recognised in the income statement in the period in which it occurs; similarly any reversal of 
this write down is recognised in the income statement in the period in which it occurs.
When inventory is sold, its current carrying value is recognised as an expense in the period in which the associated revenue 
is recognised.
Note 4c
T rade and other receivables
Trade and other receivables are initially recognised at fair value in the period to which they relate. They are held at amortised cost, less 
any provision for bad or doubtful debts. Provisions for bad or doubtful debts are presented net with the related receivable on the 
balance sheet.

Onerous contracts are recognised immediately as a provision. The amount recognised is the excess of the unavoidable costs of the 
contract over any expected economic benefits arising from the contract.
Restructuring provisions are only recognised when there is a detailed plan of the restructure that has been communicated and the 
proposed restructure is sufficiently imminent to mean that it is unlikely any significant changes will be made to the plan. The provision 
recognised includes costs that are directly attributable to the restructure and excludes any costs on ongoing activities, such as 
relocation or training of staff and marketing costs.

Section 5 – Financing and equity
This section details the Group’s debt and the related 
financing costs. It also shows the Group’s capital. Note 5c
Borrowings
The Group classifies its borrowings between senior bank borrowings and senior unsecured notes. Both are held at amortised cost using 
the effective interest method.
Interest accruals and other costs related to borrowings are shown as finance costs in the income statement. The effective interest 
calculation on senior and subordinated borrowings includes capitalised finance costs.
On 16 October 2015, as part of the IPO process, all existing borrowings were repaid and the Group arranged new borrowing facilities 
totalling £1.7bn. These new borrowings comprised of a £600m three-year term facility (Term Facility 1), a £900m five-year term facility 
(Term Facility 2) and a £200m revolving credit facility (RCF). The rates of interest are LIBOR based plus a margin dependent on leverage. 
The maximum margin for Term Facility 1 is 2.00% and for Term Facility 2 is 2.50%.
On 10 November 2015, the Group issued €500m 3.75% senior unsecured notes due 2022, the proceeds of which were used to reduce 
Term Facility 1. The issue extended the average term of the Group’s debt, diversified its funding sources and fixed the interest rate 
on this portion of the debt.

Lease arrangements
Leases are classified as either operating or finance leases. Classification depends on the substance of the lease transaction rather 
than the legal form of the lease agreement. Where substantially all of the risks and rewards of ownership lie with the lessee, the lease 
is classified as a finance lease. All other arrangements identified as leases are considered to be an operating lease.
Finance leases
Where the Group is lessee of a finance lease, it recognises both the leased asset and a finance lease liability. The asset is amortised or 
depreciated over its useful life or the lease term, whichever is the shorter. The finance lease liability is unwound over the life of the 
lease at the rate implicit in the lease.
Finance lease liabilities are payable as follows:

The Group entered into leasing arrangements for certain tangible fixed assets in 2015. The majority of finance leases have a lease term 
of five years. 
For the current financial period the average effective borrowing rate was 5.2% (2014: 5.3%). 
Interest rates are fixed at the contract date and all finance lease obligations are denominated in Sterling. All leases are on a fixed 
repayment basis and no arrangements have been entered into for contingent rental payments.
The Group’s obligations under finance leases are secured by the lessors’ rights over the leased assets.
Operating lease arrangements
Operating lease income/expense is taken to the income statement on a straight-line basis. Any lease incentives are spread over the 
life of the lease.
At 31 December 2015, the Group had obligations to make non-cancellable operating lease payments as follows:

Financial instruments
On initial recognition, financial assets and liabilities are classified into the relevant category and recognised at fair value. Their 
subsequent measurement, at either fair value or amortised cost, is dependent upon their initial classification.
Amortised cost is calculated using the effective interest rate method. Individual non-derivatives and their treatment are explained in 
their separate notes.
Financial assets and financial liabilities are offset and the net amount presented in the balance sheet when, and only when, there is a 
legally enforceable right to set off the recognised amounts. Financial assets are derecognised when the Group transfers the financial 
asset, or the contractual rights expire. Financial liabilities are derecognised when the obligation is discharged, cancelled or expires.
The Group operates net investment hedges, using foreign currency borrowings. The effective portion of the foreign exchange gain 
or loss on retranslation of the hedging instrument is taken to the foreign currency translation reserve. Any ineffective portion is 
recognised immediately in the income statement. If the hedged investment is disposed of then any balance held in reserves is 
recycled to the income statement.
In the current year, a loss of £8.2m (2014: £4.5m) was taken to the foreign exchange reserve in relation to net investment hedging.
The Group enters into derivative financial instruments to manage its exposure to interest rate and foreign exchange rate risks, 
including foreign exchange forward contracts, interest rate swaps and cross-currency swaps. Derivatives are initially recognised at 
fair value at the date the derivative contracts are entered into and are subsequently re-measured to their fair value at the end of each 
reporting period. The resulting gain or loss is recognised in separately disclosed items in the income statement immediately unless 
the derivative is designated and effective as a hedging instrument, in which event the timing of the recognition in the income 
statement depends on the nature of the hedge relationship.
The Group’s financial assets and liabilities are as follows:

Market risk
Market risk is the risk that changes in foreign exchange rates and interest rates will affect the Group’s income. The objective of market 
risk management is to manage and control market risk exposures within acceptable parameters, while optimising the return on risk.
The Group’s activities expose it primarily to the financial risk of changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates.
Market risk exposures are measured using sensitivity analysis. 
Foreign currency risk management
The Group operates throughout the world, with major operations in the United Kingdom, Europe and the US. 
Foreign currency risk is managed at a Group level, focusing on two distinct areas: Group assets and liabilities and customer 
transactions (relating to the Group’s payment business).

Customer transactions
Scheme receipts generally match merchant payments in each currency. Where there is a difference in settlement currency, the time 
between receipt and settlement is generally limited to a small number of days and therefore the foreign exchange risk is substantially 
mitigated.

Interest rate risk management
The Group is exposed to cash flow interest rate risk on borrowings and cash balances held at variable rates and mismatches on 
maturities between borrowings and cash, resulting in variable interest cash flows.
The Group’s debt agreements include contractual interest rate floors. Cash held at variable rates offsets risk arising from changing 
interest rates on the Group’s borrowings.

A 1% increase in interest rates would result in:
  An incremental increase of 0.76% (2014: 0.38%) on debt costs, as the senior unsecured notes have a fixed interest rate of 3.75%.
  An increase of 1.00% in float income arising from cash balances receiving floating rate interest. 
The net impacts of the above would be increased costs of £8.6m (2014: £3.7m increase in costs).
The Group’s Sterling senior bank debt at 31 December 2015 does not have a floor rate (2014: 1.25%).

Credit risk management
Credit risk arises from the failure of a merchant or partner bank or alternative payments provider to meet its obligations in accordance 
with agreed terms. Further information is included in the Principal risks and uncertainties section of this report on page 61.
Liquidity risk management
The Group’s liquidity risk management focuses on two distinct areas; own cash and settlement cash for customers (relating to the 
Group’s payment business).
Own cash
The Group is committed to ensuring it has sufficient liquidity to meet its payables as they fall due. 
This is achieved by holding significant cash balances and maintaining sufficient committed headroom. As at 31 December 2015, the 
Group had own cash balances of £165.3m (2014: £168.7m) and available headroom under its revolving credit facility of £160.0m. The 
revolving credit facility the Group used to have prior to the IPO had a limit of £75.0m, out of which £25.0m was available at the end of 2014.
Settlement cycle
The Group’s payment business has a short-term settlement cycle where card schemes (predominantly Visa and MasterCard) remit 
cash and the Group pays merchants from these remittances within three days.
The majority of funds are received prior to remittance to the merchant, resulting in significant cash balances relating to the 
settlement cycle. The Group has an Intra-Day Agreement Facility of £1.4bn to ensure payments can be processed whilst awaiting 
card scheme remittances.

On 12 October 2015, the Company converted 1,847,500 Ordinary Shares into CVRs which is a separate class of shares in the Company 
in the form of Contingent Value Rights. These shares are a liability by nature and therefore are classified as liabilities on the balance 
sheet and are described in more detail in Note 5i. On the same day, the Company sub-divided the remaining Ordinary Shares by 
reducing the nominal value from £1.00 per share to £0.03 per share.
On 16 October 2015, the Company issued 394,916,667 Ordinary Shares with a premium of £2.37 per share. At 31 December 2015, all 
Ordinary Shares are fully paid up at par.
The holders of Ordinary Shares are entitled to dividends and one vote per share at meetings of the Company.
Note 5g
Capital resources
The Group’s capital consists of equity, comprising issued share capital, share premium, capital contribution and retained earnings. The 
regulated entities within the Group are required to maintain minimum regulatory capital. This ensures the Company has sufficient 
capital resources for the activities required to undertake payment services. 
The capital employed in the Company, together with the reserves, ensure that a buffer to the minimum regulatory capital requirement 
is achieved.

Other equity
As part of the Group restructuring in preparation for the IPO, the Company effected a capital reduction which resulted in a transfer of 
£818.7m from share premium to retained earnings.
During the IPO process, £31.4m was received from the former parent companies to fund various share award schemes the Group 
granted. Details of the two awards can be found in Note 2c.
When the share award schemes were granted, the Group purchased its own shares in order to hedge the cash outflow upon the 
exercise of the schemes. As at year end, the Group held 9,866,475 of its own shares (£23.7m).
Note 5i
Visa Europe asset
The Visa Europe asset represents the Group’s approximate 5.9% interest in Visa Europe. It is classified as a Fair Value through Profit 
and Loss (‘FVTPL ’) financial asset with the gain or loss on its fair value recognised in finance income in the Group’s income statement.
Contingent Value Rights (‘CVRs’)
CVRs are a separate class of shares in the Company. They are non-voting and are not convertible into Ordinary Shares. Given the 
nature of the CVRs, they are classified as financial liabilities recognised initially at fair value and subsequently at amortised cost, with 
the gain or loss recognised in finance costs in the Group’s income statement. Further details of the CVRs are set out in Worldpay’s 
Prospectus dated 13 October 2015.
Proposed disposal of Visa Europe shares
On 2 November 2015, we announced the proposed disposal of our interest in Visa Europe to Visa Inc. The disposal, which is expected to 
complete in Q2 2016, is a result of Visa Inc.’s agreement to purchase 100% of Visa Europe, subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions.
Under the terms of the disposal, Worldpay will receive a mixture of cash and non-cash consideration currently estimated to be worth 
in aggregate up to €1.2bn. This is made up of up-front consideration of approximately €544m cash and €375m of Series B Preferred 
stock in Visa Inc. In addition, if the earnout pays out in full, Worldpay could receive in the region of €283m in earnout conditional upon 
achieving certain criteria relating to the incremental net revenue of Visa Europe during the earnout period. The up-front consideration 
will be reduced by any final settlement of potential liabilities relating to ongoing interchange related litigation involving Visa Europe. 
Potential losses from interchange litigation liabilities will be set against the Preferred stock which can be reduced to absorb those 
losses. A Loss Sharing Agreement entered into by Worldpay, along with the ten other largest UK members of Visa Europe, provides a 
second level of protection to Visa Inc., capped at the value of the cash consideration received. The Group’s share of such liabilities 
arising from the UK interchange related litigation is capped at the Group’s up-front consideration. 
The holders of the CVRs will be entitled to 90% of the post-tax net proceeds of the disposal in accordance with the terms of the CVRs 
(subject to the Company’s right of retention mentioned above), with Worldpay retaining 10% of the net proceeds. 
Following the disposal, Worldpay will continue to be a participant in the Visa payments system. It is anticipated that Worldpay will no 
longer have representation on the Board of Visa Europe following completion of the disposal as a result of Visa Europe ceasing to be 
a member-owned association.
Accounting treatment
Visa Europe asset
As at 30 June 2015 and on IPO completion, the Visa Europe asset was recognised in the Group’s balance sheet as a FVTPL financial 
asset with a fair value of £nil. In accordance with IAS 39, financial assets should be re-measured at each reporting date. In performing 
the revaluation at 31 December 2015, the offer by Visa Inc. to purchase Visa Europe has been taken into account in the subsequent 
measure of fair value, despite the fact that there remains some uncertainty around both the likelihood of completion of the deal 
(which is still subject to anti-trust clearance), and the amount of pre-transaction operational liabilities which would reduce the up-front 
consideration received.
When measuring the fair value of those assets, the Group uses observable market data as far as possible. Fair values are categorised 
into different levels in a fair value hierarchy based on the inputs used in the valuation techniques as follows:
  L e v e l 1: quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
  L e v e l 2 : inputs other than quoted prices included in Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly (i.e. as prices) 
or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices).
  Level 3: inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data (unobservable inputs).

Worldpay Group plc
Annual Report and Accounts 2015
Notes to the consolidated financial statements
Section 5 – Financing and equity
continued Note 5i
Visa Europe asset (continued)
The Visa Europe asset is classified as Level 3 due to the lack of identical transactions with regularly available market prices. 
In order to fair value the financial asset as at 31 December 2015, the Directors have considered a range of potential outcomes and 
calculated a weighted average, considering the likelihood of various factors, including the expected likelihood of the transaction 
completing, the likely value of the potential level of Visa Europe liabilities that the Group may be liable for and the timing of cash flows.
CVR liabilities
The CVR liabilities were recognised at £nil fair value on initial recognition. At year end, they were re-measured at amortised cost based 
on a re-estimation of future cash flows, with any changes being recognised in the income statement. 
Discounting 
The weighted average of the outcomes were discounted to reflect the time value of money. Under IAS 39, the financial asset should 
be discounted using the market participants’ weighted average cost of capital (‘WACC’) whereas the financial liabilities should be 
discounted using the Group’s WACC. In this instance, the difference between using the market participants’ WACC and the Group’s 
WACC is not material.

  Consolidation
The consolidated financial statements incorporate the financial statements of Worldpay Group plc and entities controlled by it (its 
subsidiaries).
Income and expenses of subsidiaries acquired or disposed of during the period are included in the consolidated statement of 
comprehensive income from the effective date of acquisition and up to the effective date of disposal, as appropriate.
Total comprehensive income of subsidiaries is attributed to the owners of Worldpay Group plc and to the non-controlling interests, 
even if this results in the non-controlling interests having a deficit balance.
The period end assets and liabilities of the entities are consolidated with those of Worldpay Group plc and presented in the 
consolidated balance sheet.
When necessary, adjustments are made to the financial statements of subsidiaries to bring their accounting policies into line with the 
IFRS policies used by the Group and for any fair value adjustments required on consolidation.
All intra-Group balances, income and expenses and the effect of any intra-Group profits on the balance sheet are eliminated in full on 
consolidation.
Note 6a
Investments in subsidiaries
An entity is classified as a subsidiary of the Group when the Group has control over that entity, either through majority 
shareholding or other means.
Acquisitions
Acquisitions of businesses are accounted for using the acquisition method. The consideration transferred in a business 
combination is measured at fair value; it includes cash, other assets transferred and any contingent consideration due to the 
former owners of the acquiree. Acquisition-related costs are recognised in the income statement as incurred. The identifiable 
assets acquired and the liabilities assumed are recognised at their fair value as at the acquisition date.
Goodwill is initially measured as the excess of the aggregate of the consideration transferred and any non-controlling interest 
over the fair value of the net identifiable assets acquired, liabilities assumed plus any existing interest in the business acquired. If 
the consideration transferred is lower than the fair value of the net assets of the subsidiary acquired, the difference is recognised 
immediately in profit or loss as a gain on a bargain purchase.
If the initial accounting for a business combination is incomplete by the end of the reporting period in which the combination occurs, 
the Group reports provisional amounts for the items for which the accounting is incomplete.
Those provisional amounts are adjusted during the following reporting period, or additional assets or liabilities are recognised, to 
reflect new information obtained about facts and circumstances that existed at the acquisition date that, if known, would have 
affected the amounts recognised at that date.
Disposals
When the Group ceases to have control, any retained interest in the entity is re-measured to its fair value at the date when control 
is lost, with the change in carrying amount recognised in profit or loss. The fair value is the initial carrying amount for the purposes 
of subsequently accounting for the retained interest as an associate, joint venture or financial asset.
In addition, any amounts previously recognised in other comprehensive income in respect of that entity are accounted for as if the 
Group had directly disposed of the related assets or liabilities. This may mean that amounts previously recognised in other 
comprehensive income are reclassified to profit or loss.

Joint ventures and associates
Joint ventures and associates are accounted for using the equity method whereby the interest in the joint ventures and associates is initially 
recorded at cost and adjusted thereafter for the post-acquisition change in the Group’s share of net assets less any impairment in the value 
of individual investments. The profit or loss of the Group includes the Group’s share of the profit or loss of the joint ventures and associates.
Any excess of the cost of acquisition over the Group’s share of the net fair value of the identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent 
liabilities recognised at the date of acquisition is recognised as goodwill.
The goodwill is included within the carrying amount of the investment and is assessed for impairment as part of that investment.

On 8 May 2014, the Group purchased 65,402 Series A Preferred Shares issued by Pazien Inc. for US$3m. Pazien Inc. is an innovative 
start-up creating products using transaction data to enable more intelligent routing, automated optimisation and reconciliation for 
Global eCom merchants.
 
At the time, the Group’s stake represented 34% shareholding.
At the same time, the Group entered into an agreement and is obliged to purchase a further 65,402 Series A Preferred Shares in Pazien 
Inc. in 2015 for the same amount of consideration subject to the completion of a specified milestone event.
On 4 June 2015, the Group purchased the further 65,402 shares. Although the Group now holds 51% of shares in Pazien Inc., it does not 
represent control over the entity as the Board is shared equally between the Group and the founders of the business.
On 15 May 2015, the Group purchased 499 Class A Shares of SPay, Inc. representing 49.9% shareholding at the time.
On 18 December 2015, SPay, Inc. issued further shares to another investor which reduced the Group’s shareholding to 25.0%.

Company statement of changes in equity
For the year ended 31 December 2015 c1. Basis of preparation
Worldpay Group plc is a company incorporated in the United 
Kingdom under the Companies Act.
The Company meets the definition of a qualifying entity under 
FRS 100 (Financial Reporting Standard 100) issued by the 
Financial Reporting Council. Accordingly, in the year ended 
31 December 2015 the Company has undergone transition 
from reporting under UK Generally Accepted Accounting Policies 
(‘GAAP’) to FRS 101 as issued by the Financial Reporting Council. 
No material differences between reporting under UK GAAP and 
FRS 101 were identified. As such no transitional balance sheet  
has been presented.
The financial statements have therefore been prepared in 
accordance with FRS 101 ‘Reduced Disclosure Framework’ 
as issued by the Financial Reporting Council.
No profit and loss account is presented for the company as 
permitted by section 408 of the Companies Act 2006. The loss 
after tax for the Company was £24.1m (one month ended 
31 December 2014: £3.0m).
As permitted by FRS 101, the Company has taken advantage 
of the disclosure exemptions available under that standard in 
relation to share-based payments, financial instruments, capital 
management, presentation of a cash flow statement, standards 
not yet effective and related party transactions. Where relevant, 
equivalent disclosures have been given in the consolidated 
financial statements of Worldpay Group plc, which the 
Company is consolidated in. We expect to continue to take 
advantage of this disclosure exemption for the foreseeable 
future.
The financial statements have been prepared on the historical 
cost basis, except for financial instruments and the Company’s 
Contingent Value Right shares, which are measured at fair value.
Going concern
The Company acts as the ultimate holding company of the 
Worldpay Group. It made a loss of £24.1m (2014: £3.0m). The 
Company was in a net asset position of £1,707.5m (2014: £831.6m) 
and net current asset position of £143.1m (2014: £125.3m).
The forecast for the 12 month period from the date of approval  
of these financial statements demonstrates the Company’s  
ability to continue to operate with its current resources for the 
foreseeable future. 
As a result, the Directors continue to adopt the going concern 
basis of accounting in preparing the annual financial statements. 
Further information is provided in Note 1a to the Group financial 
statements.
Significant accounting policies
Investment in subsidiaries
Investment in subsidiaries are accounted for at cost less, 
where appropriate, provisions for impairment.
Dividends
Dividend income from investments is recognised when the 
shareholders’ rights to receive payment have been established. 
Dividends payable to the Company’s shareholders are recognised 
as a liability and deducted from shareholders’ equity in the 
period in which the shareholders’ right to receive payment 
is established.
Contingent Value Rights (‘CVRs’)
See Note 1b and Note 5i to the Group’s financial statements for 
details on the accounting policy in respect of the CVR liabilities.
Share premium
Share premium is recorded at the proceeds received in excess 
of the shares’ nominal value, net of direct issue costs.
Financial liabilities
On initial recognition financial liabilities are recognised at 
fair value and subsequently measured using the effective 
interest method.
Taxation
Provision is made for taxation at current enacted rates on 
taxable profits, arising in income or in equity. Deferred taxation 
is accounted for in full for all temporary differences between the 
carrying amount of an asset or liability for accounting purposes 
and its carrying amount for tax purposes.
Deferred tax assets are only recognised to the extent that it is 
probable that they will be recovered. Deferred tax assets arising 
from deductable temporary differences associated with such 
investments and interests are only recognised to the extent that 
it is probable that there will be sufficient taxable profits against 
which to utilise the benefits of the temporary differences and 
they are expected to reverse in the foreseeable future. 
The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at the end 
of each reporting period and reduced to the extent that it is no 
longer probable that sufficient taxable profits will be available to 
allow all or part of the asset to be recovered.
Deferred tax liabilities and assets are measured at the tax rates 
that are expected to apply in the period in which the liability is 
settled or the asset realised, based on tax rates (and tax laws) 
that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the end of 
the reporting period. The measurement of deferred tax liabilities 
and assets reflects the tax consequences that would follow 
from the manner in which the Company expects, at the end of 
the reporting period, to recover or settle the carrying amount 
of its assets and liabilities.

Annual Report and Accounts 2015
Notes to Company financial statements c2. Critical accounting estimates and judgements
For the preparation of the Company’s financial statements, 
the Directors are required to make judgements, estimates and 
assumptions. The estimates and associated assumptions are based 
on historical experience and other factors that are considered to be 
relevant. Actual results may differ from these estimates.
The estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an 
ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised 
in the period in which the estimate is revised if the revision 
affects only that period, or in the period of the revision and future 
periods if the revision affects both current and future periods.
The most significant areas of estimation uncertainty, and areas 
where critical judgements are made in applying accounting 
policies that have a material effect on the financial statements, 
are listed below.
Income and deferred taxes
The Company’s tax charge on ordinary activities is the sum of the 
total current and deferred tax charges calculated by reference to 
the legal requirements. 
As part of this process, the Company applies its judgement in order 
to determine the tax charge applying to those matters for which the 
final tax treatment is considered by the Company to be uncertain. 
Where the final tax outcome of these matters is different from 
the amounts that were initially recorded, such differences are 
recognised in the period in which such determination is made. 
Recoverability of receivables
A receivable is impaired when there is objective evidence that, due 
to events since the receivable was created, the Company cannot 
recover the original expected cash flows from the receivable. 
The impairment loss is the difference between the carrying value of 
the receivable and the present value of estimated future cash flows.
The Directors review all of the above critical accounting 
estimates and judgements on a regular basis and are satisfied 
that no reasonably possible change in the key assumptions would 
give rise to a material change in the amount reported. 
c3. Staff cost and Directors’ emoluments
The Company has no employees during the current period 
(2014: nil).
The remuneration that the Directors received in the year in 
relation to their services to the Group as a whole are disclosed in 
the Remuneration report.
c4. Investment in subsidiary undertakings
Investments in subsidiary undertakings are carried at cost less 
impairment. Movements during the year were as follows:

As explained in Note 5i to the Group’s financial statements, the 
Group holds an approximate 5.9% interest in Visa Europe, with a 
related CVR liability equivalent to 90% of the post-tax value. The 
Visa Europe assets are held in subsidiary undertakings whereas 
the external CVR liabilities are held in the Company. As such, an 
intercompany CVR has been put in place to compensate the 
Company for any amount payable under the external CVR and is 
included in the amount due from Group undertakings falling due 
within one year in the table above. This is shown as a financial 
asset of £140.9m. The corresponding external CVR liability for the 
Company is shown in Note c8 on the following page.
The amount due from Group undertakings in 2014 related to loans 
lent to subsidiaries which were repaid during IPO.

Share register and shareholder enquiries
The Company’s share register is maintained by Equiniti.
Queries relating to Worldpay Group plc shares should be 
addressed to:
The Registrar
Equiniti
Aspect House
Spencer Road
Lancing
West Sussex BN99 6DA
Tel: 0371 384 2030*
(International telephone number: +44 (0)121 415 7047)
*  Lines are open 8.30am to 5.30pm (London time), Monday to Friday (excluding 
UK public holidays).
Shareholders should quote the Company reference number 4726 
and their shareholder reference number (which can be found on 
their share certificates), when contacting the Registrar.
Electronic communications
On 13 January 2016, the Company issued a letter to shareholders, 
allowing the Company’s corporate website to be used as the 
primary means of communication with its shareholders. A 
response form was sent to shareholders enabling them to 
choose either to:
  receive notification by email when shareholder documentation 
is available on the website; or
  continue to receive shareholder documentation in hard copy.
Shareholders who did not respond were deemed, in accordance 
with the Companies Act 2006, to have agreed to receive 
shareholder documentation via the Company’s corporate 
website. These arrangements for electronic shareholder 
communications provide shareholders with the opportunity to 
access information in a timely manner and help the Company to 
reduce both its costs and its environmental impact.
Shareview
To be able to access information about their shares and other 
investments online, shareholders can register with Shareview 
(www.shareview.co.uk/info/register). Registration is free; 
shareholders will need their shareholder reference number which 
is shown on their form of proxy and share certificate. By 
registering for this service, shareholders will:
  help reduce paper, print and postage costs;
  help the environment;
  be able to submit their queries by email; and
  be able to manage their shareholding easily and securely online.
Once registered, whenever shareholder documents are available, 
shareholders will be sent a link to the appropriate website, where 
the documents will be available to view or download. Receiving 
documents online does not affect shareholders’ rights in any way.
Shareholder information 168
Worldpay Group plc
Annual Report and Accounts 2015
Multiple accounts on the share register
If a shareholder receives two or more sets of the documents 
concerning the AGM, this means that there is more than one 
account in their name on the shareholder register, perhaps 
because either the name or the address appears on each account 
in a slightly different way. For security reasons, Equiniti will not 
amalgamate the accounts without the shareholder’s written 
consent. Therefore, if a shareholder would like their multiple 
accounts to be combined, they should write to Equiniti at the 
address above, detailing the different shareholder reference 
numbers, and request that they be combined into one account.
Dividend policy
The Board intends to adopt a dividend policy based on a payout 
ratio of 20-30% of reported profit after tax per annum, 
commencing in the current financial year and we expect to 
announce our first interim dividend with our 2016 half year 
results, payable later in the year. As referenced in the Prospectus 
issued prior to the IPO, no dividend will be paid in respect of 2015.
Direct dividend payments
Shareholders may wish to consider having any future dividends 
paid directly into their personal bank or building society account. 
This has a number of advantages, including the crediting of 
cleared funds on the dividend payment date. If you would like any 
future dividends to be paid in this way, you should contact the 
Registrar or complete a mandate form available from 
www.shareview.co.uk and return it to the Registrar.
Information in relation to the IPO

Warning to shareholders about share fraud
Fraudsters use persuasive and high-pressure tactics to lure 
investors into scams. They may offer to sell shares that turn out 
to be worthless or non-existent, or to buy shares at an inflated 
price in return for an up-front payment. While high profits are 
promised, if you buy or sell shares in this way you will probably 
lose your money.
5,000 people contact the Financial Conduct Authority (‘FCA’)
about share fraud each year, with victims losing an average of 
£20,000.
How to avoid share fraud
If you are offered unsolicited investment advice, discounted 
shares, a premium price for shares you own, or free company or 
research reports, you should take these steps before handing 
over any money:
1.   Keep in mind that firms authorised by the FCA are unlikely to 
contact you out of the blue with an offer to buy or sell shares.
2.   Do not get into a conversation, note the name of the person 
and firm contacting you and then end the call.
3.   Check the Financial Services Register from www.fca.org.uk 
to see if the person and firm contacting you is authorised by 
the FCA.
4.   Beware of fraudsters claiming to be from an authorised firm, 
copying its website or giving you false contact details.
5.   Use the firm’s contact details listed on the Register if you want 
to call it back.
6.   Call the FCA on 0800 111 6768 if the firm does not have contact 
details on the Register or you are told they are out of date.
7.   Search the list of unauthorised firms to avoid at 
www.fca.org.uk/scams.
8.   Consider that if you buy or sell shares from an unauthorised 
firm you will not have access to the Financial Ombudsman 
Service or Financial Services Compensation Scheme.
9.   Think about getting independent financial and professional 
advice before you hand over any money.
10.  Remember: if it sounds too good to be true, it probably is!

“ Strong customer focus produces 
good results. ”
Introduction by the Chairman
Vanni Treves
Chairman
Results
I am pleased to present the ﬁ fth Annual Report of the 
Intertek Group since its debut on the London Stock 
Exchange in May 2002. The Group has enjoyed a 
successful year and has continued to grow its 
operations both organically and through acquiring 
complementary businesses. Revenue for the Group 
grew by 14.5% to £664.5m in 2006 compared to 
2005. Our three largest divisions, representing 92.0% 
of the Group’s revenue, grew by 20.9% in total and 
Government Services, our smallest division, declined 
as expected, due to the discontinuation of pre-
shipment inspection programmes in Nigeria and 
Venezuela. 
Group operating proﬁ t was £98.1m, up 18.2% over 
2005. Operating proﬁ t, stated before the amortisation 
of business combination intangibles and the 
impairment of goodwill (‘adjusted operating proﬁ t’) 
was £102.2m, up 17.3% over 2005. Excluding 
Government Services, adjusted operating proﬁ t 
increased by 35.0%.
These results include the contribution of acquisitions 
made in 2005 and 2006. Excluding these acquisitions 
the organic growth in revenue was 13.3% for the 
three largest divisions and 7.9% for the Group. 
Organic growth in adjusted operating proﬁ t was 
27.3% for the three largest divisions and 10.7% 
for the Group.
Acquisitions 
In line with the Group’s strategy of extending 
its range of services and territories through 
complementary acquisitions, seven new businesses 
were acquired in 2006, for net consideration of 
£36.9m. The largest of these was Alta Analytical 
Laboratory Inc., which was acquired on 30 November 
2006 for £14.0m. Alta which is based in California, 
USA provides analytical services to North American 
pharmaceutical and clinical research organisations. 
This acquisition broadens the range of laboratory 
services offered to the pharmaceutical sector. Other 
acquisitions enhanced our ability to offer analytical 
chemical testing in Europe and strengthened our 
market position in strategically important countries 
such as Japan and Spain. 
On 9 January 2007 the Group acquired for £12.9m, 
UK based Umitek Ltd and its subsidiaries, CAPCIS and 
SREL which provide specialist testing and consultancy 
services to the oil and gas industries in the North Sea 
and globally. 
Dividends
An interim dividend of 4.6p per share (2005: 3.9p) 
was paid to shareholders on 14 November 2006. The 
Directors will propose a ﬁ nal dividend of 10.2p per 
share at the Annual General Meeting on 11 May 
2007, to be paid to shareholders on 15 June 2007. If 
approved, this will make a full year dividend of 14.8p 
per share (2005: 12.0p), an increase of 23.3%. The 
Group continues to follow a progressive dividend 
policy. In determining the future level of dividends we 
previously set dividend cover to be at least three times 
earnings. As a result of our strengthening balance 
sheet, in future we will set the dividend to be covered 
by at least two and a half times earnings.
Earnings per share
Basic earnings per share were 40.9p, up 11.1% over 
last year. Diluted adjusted earnings per share, before 
amortisation of business combination intangibles and 
impairment of goodwill, were 43.2p, up 10.5% from 
39.1p. Excluding the proﬁ t on sale of an associate 
made in 2005, the earnings per share growth 
increased from 10.5% to 13.4%. Details of the 
calculation of earnings per share is given in note 8 
to the ﬁ nancial statements.
Board changes
The Intertek Board of Directors was further 
strengthened during the year by the appointment of 
Christopher Knight and Debra Rade as Non-Executive 
Directors.  Christopher Knight is a Chartered 
Accountant and former investment banker with a 
wide range of experience in corporate ﬁ nance both in 
the UK and internationally. Debra Rade is currently a  05 Intertek Group plc Annual Report
partner in a major US law ﬁ rm. Her practice focuses 
on corporate governance and compliance as well as 
product safety and certiﬁ cation. Until 2002, Debra 
was a senior ofﬁ cer of Underwriters Laboratories Inc., 
a provider of product safety and certiﬁ cation. Their 
expertise and experience will contribute to the 
continued success of the Intertek Group.
After leading the Consumer Goods division for most 
of his 33 years with Intertek, Raymond Kong retired 
as Chief Executive of that division on 1 July 2006 and 
became a Non-Executive Director of Intertek Group 
plc. Raymond continues as President of Asia and 
China, using his knowledge and experience to 
advance the Group’s interests in that region. On 
behalf of everyone at Intertek, I would like to express 
our deep gratitude to Raymond for his outstanding 
contribution towards building the Consumer Goods 
division into the successful business that it is today. 
Paul Yao, formerly the Chief Operating Ofﬁ cer of 
the Consumer Goods division, was appointed Chief 
Executive of the division to replace Raymond. I wish 
both colleagues success in their new roles.
Biographies of each of the Board members are set 
out on pages 18 and 19. 
Employees
The growth reﬂ ected in this strong set of results has 
been delivered by the dedication and expertise of 
the Group’s employees in providing value to our 
customers.  At the end of 2006, the Group employed 
over 18,000 people in 109 countries, an increase of 
2,600 people over last year. One of our key challenges 
in the Group, is recruiting, training and developing 
our people to ensure that they deliver excellent 
services which add value to our customers. In order
to meet this challenge, we have strengthened the 
human resources function and have developed new 
metrics to identify and develop talent within the Group. 
On behalf of the Board, I would like to thank everyone 
in the Group for their effort in making 2006 another 
good year and for their continued dedication towards 
giving our customers the best possible service.
Outlook 
The Group operates in a dynamic global marketplace 
where change is continual. Through its extensive 
global network and experienced people, the Group 
will continue to adapt and expand its services to 
anticipate and meet the changing needs of customers. 
The Group’s strong ﬁ nancial position and ability to 
generate cash will enable it to invest in new facilities 
and acquire new businesses. Looking forward, we see 
good opportunities to develop the business further, 
both organically and through selective acquisitions, 
and whilst the weak dollar will impact on our results, 
we remain conﬁ dent about the prospects for 2007.
Vanni Treves
Chairman
 Alta Analytical Laboratory Inc
In November 2006, Intertek acquired 
the pharmaceutical testing company Alta 
Analytical Laboratory Inc. Alta supports 
North American pharmaceutical and clinical 
research organisations by providing a variety 
of analytical services including the testing 
that is required in the development of 
new drugs. 
The business is based out of two sites 
in California with a pool of experts in 
immunochemistry and bioanalytical services 
and counts major global pharmaceutical 
and biotech companies among its clients.
Alta’s expertise and business gives Intertek 
a platform to build a global presence in the 
area of analytical services, extending the 
existing European offering. Alta will be able 
to utilise Intertek’s extensive global reach 
to expand their bioanalytical services to 
existing and new international customers 
and markets.
 Strength through acquisition 06 Intertek Group plc Annual Report
2006 was a year of increased public scrutiny of 
how our behaviour affects the global environment. 
And this will continue. Companies across the world 
are looking internally and at their products to 
consider what they should do to be more 
environmentally friendly. Our customers are 
increasingly seeking help from us to improve the 
environmental impact of their products and 
processes.
In the USA for example, we support QualComm by 
ensuring that their digital wireless products do not 
contain environmentally hazardous substances and 
thereby comply with new European legislation. In 
the UK, the development of new biofuel products 
requires complex testing processes and research 
and we have undertaken ground-breaking work in 
this area with Biofuels Corporation. And, in India, 
we work with Carrier India to test the energy 
efﬁ ciency of their products and support their 
efforts in providing superior products to their 
customers and meeting the proposed India Energy 
Label requirements. 
With countries like India enjoying tremendous 
growth in consumerism, our work and skills in 
tackling and ensuring the environmental efﬁ ciency 
of consumer products thus becomes critical. Social 
and regulatory trends for more environmentally 
friendly products continue to grow at a great pace 
in every country and Intertek is well positioned to 
help and beneﬁ t from this trend. 
The increasing afﬂ uence in emerging markets is 
opening up new opportunities and challenges for 
the world’s manufacturers, retailers and brands. 
Intertek is experienced in helping customers 
bring new products to new markets under tight 
budgetary and time constraints. We will beneﬁ t 
from the forthcoming consumer explosion in 
emerging markets where we already have an 
extensive presence. As we work alongside our 
customers and help them manage their 
international expansion, we bring them the 
advantages and security of partnering with 
a world class global corporation.
The market for safety and quality services is 
growing strongly. Consumers, manufacturers and 
retailers have higher quality and safety expectations 
as there are increasing numbers of products in 
the market of growing complexity and due to 
competition among retailers and manufacturers. 
Environmental concerns from consumers and 
regulatory bodies are increasing the need for new 
and revised safety and environmental standards.
Our customers are under pressure to expand their 
product lines, increase speed to market, but also to 
mitigate supply chain risk. They must manage 
changing patterns in global trade, sourcing and 
distribution and consider the effects of new and 
emerging markets. Our goal is to be a source of 
vital support to clients through changing times. 
With our global network and local and international 
management, we are well-placed to remain their 
trusted partner.
Chief Executive Ofﬁ cer’s review
Inside Intertek
Wolfhart Hauser
Chief Executive Ofﬁ cer 07 Intertek Group plc Annual Report
All of these trends create a more complex world 
for our clients to operate in and an increasing 
challenge for manufacturers, retailers and brands 
alike. Intertek is there to support them through the 
changing regulatory compliance, consumer attitude 
and global supply chain issues. We can do this in 
many different conﬁ gurations and client 
relationships. 
We are seeing many customers beneﬁ ting from 
outsourcing to Intertek whole processes, divisions, 
standalone laboratories or just the more complex 
areas of safety and quality assurance. Through 
economies of scale and a worldwide resource of 
talented people, the beneﬁ ts that can accrue from 
this process to both parties can be sizeable. 
Ultimately, it is our people here at Intertek that are 
the strength of our brand and allow us to add value 
to our clients. 
I frequently meet Intertek scientists and engineers 
who say that their achievement of ﬁ nding 
innovative solutions for clients’ complex challenges 
is a great source of satisfaction to them. I have seen 
Intertek leaders offer Government ministers novel 
solutions to their international trade security and 
customs challenges and develop them into a long-
term relationship of fundamental beneﬁ t to the 
well-being and economy of that state. 
People at Intertek carry a high level of dedication, 
expertise and a desire to see our customers 
succeed. Through this, we can be sure that we will 
continue to create value for our customers, demand 
for our services in expanding markets, and increase 
our shareholders’ wealth.

prior year. This increase comprised £39.5m from 
acquisitions made in 2005 and 2006 and £46.3m 
from organic growth, reduced by £1.4m due to 
currency translation. The organic growth of 8.1% 
was generated primarily by increased global trade, 
growth in the market for quality and safety 
services, an increase in environmental regulations 
and an increase in outsourcing. 
Part of the Group’s growth strategy is to make 
bolt-on acquisitions which complement and extend 
the Group’s service offering into new areas of 
expertise and new geographies. The Group made 
12 such acquisitions in 2005 and seven in 2006, 
which were located in 12 different countries. These 
businesses have extended the range of analytical 
services offered by the Group in a variety of sectors 
including the pharmaceutical and chemical 
industries and have increased the Group’s footprint 
in strategically important countries such as India, 
Japan and Spain. The Group is able to leverage 
the return from these acquisitions by offering new 
services on a global basis to existing customers. 
 
Geographically, all regions reported growth in 
revenue with the largest contributors being the 
United States and China. Growth in the US was 
driven partly by acquisitions but also by the strong 
petroleum market. 
Introduction
This review provides information on the 
performance of the Group for the year ended 
31 December 2006. It highlights areas which 
have performed well and explains why some 
areas have underperformed.
A more detailed review of the performance 
of each division is given on pages 15 to 17.
Key performance indicators
This review uses certain key performance indicators 
(KPIs) to assess how well the Group and the 
divisions have performed during the year and 
whether the Group has met the expectations of its 
stakeholders. These KPIs are reviewed by the Board 
and management on a monthly basis and are used 
to assess past performance and set targets for the 
future. Most of the KPIs also form part of the 
management incentive scheme whereby managers 
may receive annual bonus payments on achieving 
or exceeding the targets set for the year.
Growth in revenue
Intertek provides a wide range of quality and safety 
related services to customers operating in the 
global marketplace. Top line revenue growth is a 
key performance measure. Revenue increased by 
£84.4m to £664.5m in 2006, up 14.5% over the

Performance review
Growth in China was driven mainly by the 
migration of manufacturing from western 
countries. The Group has been established in 
China for many years and continues to expand 
its facilities into new locations with 13 new 
laboratories opened in 2006 offering services to 
a wide range of industries including textiles, toys, 
minerals, electrical and automotive. There was 
substantial growth in revenue in The Netherlands 
as a result of the acquisition from DSM, the Dutch 
chemical manufacturer, of Polychemlab which 
offers specialist analytical services to the chemical 
industry. On the downside, revenue was reduced 
by the cessation of the pre-shipment inspection 
programmes in Nigeria and Venezuela. 
Growth in adjusted operating proﬁ t 
and margin
For management purposes, the Group adjusts 
operating proﬁ t and operating margin to exclude 
the amortisation of business combination 
intangibles and the impairment of goodwill. 
In 2006, adjusted operating proﬁ t was £102.2m, 
up 17.3% over the previous year. The adjusted 
operating margin was 15.4%, up 40 basis points 
from 15.0%. The adjusted operating proﬁ t in the 
three main divisions increased by 35.0%, however 
the smallest division, Government Services, declined 
by 59.5% due to the cessation of pre-shipment 
inspection contracts in Nigeria and Venezuela in 
2005. On an organic basis, adjusted operating 
proﬁ t increased by 27.3% for the three main 
divisions and 10.7% for the Group. The adjusted 
organic margin for the Group was 15.3%.
Impairment of goodwill
The carrying value of capitalised goodwill was 
reviewed for impairment and a charge of £0.3m 
(2005: £2.0m) was made to operating proﬁ t in 
2006 to reduce the goodwill to its fair value. The 
impairment related to a small business in Estonia 
acquired by the Oil, Chemical & Agri division in 
2005, which has not performed in line with 
management expectations. Details of how the 
impairment reviews are performed are given in 
note 10 to the ﬁ nancial statements. The capitalised 
goodwill of £71.1m (2005: £55.7m) relates to 
acquisitions made since 1998. 
Net ﬁ nancing costs
As set out in note 6 to the ﬁ nancial statements, 
the Group reported ﬁ nance income in 2006 of 
£4.5m (2005: £3.5m). This comprised the expected 
return on pension assets, interest on bank balances 
and foreign exchange differences on interest 
accruals. The increase was mainly due to higher 
interest rates.
The Group’s ﬁ nance expense for 2006 was £11.5m 
compared to £9.4m in 2005. The charge comprised 
interest on borrowings, pension interest cost and 
other ﬁ nancing fees. The increase was primarily due 
to higher interest rates. 
Proﬁ t before taxation
Proﬁ t before tax was £91.4m compared to 
£79.4m in 2005, mainly due to the good trading 
performance in the year.
 
Taxation
As set out in note 7 to the ﬁ nancial statements, 
income tax expense for 2006 was £22.5m (2005: 
£18.7m), comprising a current tax charge of 
£22.0m (2005: £24.1m) plus a deferred tax charge 
of £0.5m (2005: credit £5.4m). The tax rate was 
24.6%, up from 23.6% in 2005. The main reason 
for the increase in the tax rate was increased 
earnings in higher taxed jurisdictions. The tax rate 
is expected to be sustainable at close to current 
year levels for the short to medium-term.
Proﬁ t for the year
Proﬁ t for the year was £68.9m (2005: £60.7m) of 
which £63.8m (2005: £57.1m) was attributable to 
equity holders of the Company. 
Minority interests
As set out in note 20 to the ﬁ nancial statements, 
proﬁ t attributable to minority shareholders was 
£5.1m in 2006 (2005: £3.6m). The increase was 
mainly due to the strong growth in the Group’s 
non-wholly owned subsidiaries in Asia.

Hazardous substances
Legislation concerning the restriction of 
hazardous substances has put pressure on 
many companies to meet their environmental 
responsibilities. With QualComm, a leading 
developer of digital wireless communication 
products, Intertek not only tested components 
but also analysed their entire manufacturing 
control system. As a result, QualComm’s products 
became compliant and their speed to market 
signiﬁ cantly improved. 12 Intertek Group plc Annual Report

Performance review
Earnings per share
Earnings per share (EPS) is calculated by dividing 
the proﬁ t attributable to equity holders of the 
Company by the weighted average number of shares 
in issue during the year. As set out in note 8 to the 
ﬁ nancial statements, basic EPS at the end of the year 
was 40.9p (2005: 36.8p), an increase of 11.1%. A 
diluted adjusted EPS calculation is also shown which 
removes the impact of amortisation of business 
combination intangibles and impairment of goodwill 
to give diluted adjusted EPS of 43.2p (2005: 39.1p), 
an increase of 10.5%. Excluding the proﬁ t on sale of 
associates of £1.6m in 2005, the growth in diluted 
adjusted EPS was 13.4%. Year-on-year growth in 
diluted adjusted EPS is one of the key performance 
targets that the Group uses to incentivise its 
managers.
Dividends 
During the year, the Group paid total dividends of 
£19.8m (2005: £16.9m), which comprised £12.6m in 
respect of the ﬁ nal dividend for the year ended 31 
December 2005 paid on 16 June 2006, at the rate of 
8.1p per share and £7.2m being the interim dividend 
in respect of the year ended 31 December 2006, paid 
on 14 November 2006 at a rate of 4.6p per share. 
These amounts were charged to retained earnings 
(see note 19 to the ﬁ nancial statements). Since the 
balance sheet date, the Directors proposed a ﬁ nal 
dividend in respect of the year ended 31 December 
2006, of 10.2p per share (2005: 8.1p) making a full 
year dividend of 14.8p per share (2005: 12.0p), an 
increase of 23.3% over last year. If approved, the ﬁ nal 
dividend will be paid to shareholders on 15 June 2007.
Cash and liquidity
In order to maintain its growth strategy, the 
Group continually invests in laboratory equipment, 
computer systems, new facilities and acquisitions. 
A strong operating cash ﬂ ow is therefore very 
important. One of the key performance indicators 
used by the Group to measure the efﬁ ciency of its 
cash generation is the percentage of operating proﬁ t 
that is converted into cash. As shown in the table 
above, in 2006, 79.6% of adjusted operating proﬁ t 
was converted into cash compared to 75.1% in 2005.
Cash generated from operations was £124.6m for 
2006, compared to £96.7m for 2005. The increase 
of 28.9% was due to improved proﬁ tability and 
effective working capital management. Provisions 
decreased by £4.2m due to the settlement of claims 
and of restructuring costs incurred in the 
Government Services division. 
Cash outﬂ ows from investing activities in 2006 
were £78.1m (2005: £71.4m), up 9.4%. The main 
outﬂ ows were £36.9m (2005: £44.5m) for the 
acquisition of subsidiaries and £43.2m (2005: 
£31.3m) for the acquisition of property, plant and 
equipment and computer software. The increase in 
capital expenditure was due to increased 
investment in laboratories, particularly in China, an 
increase in analytical services which require 
specialised equipment and investment in container 
scanning equipment. 
Cash ﬂ ows from ﬁ nancing activities comprised cash 
inﬂ ows from the issue of share capital following the 
exercise of employee share options of £4.2m (2005: 
£3.8m) and the net drawdown of debt of £8.2m 
(2005: £9.7m), and cash outﬂ ows of dividends paid 
to minorities of £3.8m (2005: £2.9m) and dividends 
paid to Group shareholders of £19.8m (2005: 
£16.9m), which resulted in a net cash outﬂ ow
of £11.2m (2005: £5.9m).
As set out in note 15 to the ﬁ nancial statements, 
interest bearing loans and borrowings were £178.4m 
at 31 December 2006, a decrease of 6.4% over 
2005. The Group’s borrowings are in currencies 
which match its asset base. The decrease in 
borrowings comprised exchange adjustments of 
£20.5m principally due to the translation into sterling 
of borrowings denominated in US dollars and HK 
dollars, partially offset by the net drawdown of debt 
of £8.2m. The debt drawdown was mainly used to 
ﬁ nance acquisitions. Cash and cash equivalents at 
31 December 2006, were £49.5m, a decrease of 
2.6% over 2005. As shown in note 23 to the 
ﬁ nancial statements, net debt at 31 December 
2006 was £128.9m (2005: £139.9m).  13 Intertek Group plc Annual Report

Acquisitions and disposals
As described earlier, during 2006 the Group made 
seven acquisitions for a net cash outﬂ ow of £36.9m 
(2005: £44.5m). Further information on acquisitions 
is given in the business review by division which 
starts on page 15 and in note 24 to the ﬁ nancial 
statements.
Return on business assets
For management purposes, the Group calculates 
return on business assets as the adjusted operating 
proﬁ t for the year divided by the carrying value of 
business assets which comprise operating working 
capital plus tangible ﬁ xed assets and software at the 
end of the year. For 2006 the return on business 
assets was 57.0%, up 340 basis points from 53.6% 
in 2005. 
Risks
In common with all businesses, the Group is 
affected by a number of risk factors, some of 
which are outside its control. Although many of the 
risk factors inﬂ uencing the Group’s performance 
are macroeconomic and likely to affect the 
performance of business generally, others are 
particular to Intertek’s operations. Speciﬁ c risks 
which management are aware of are detailed 
below, however there may be other risks that are 
currently unknown or are currently regarded as 
immaterial which could turn out to be material. Any 
of these risks could have the potential to impact the 
performance of the Group, its assets, liquidity and 
capital resources. 
Treasury risk
The Group operates in 109 countries and has 166 
subsidiaries, of which 143 report in currencies other 
than sterling. One of the primary ﬁ nancial market 
risk exposures in the Group is foreign currency risk. 
This risk is managed by the Group’s treasury 
function as described below.
Treasury management
The Group’s treasury and funding activities are 
undertaken by a centralised treasury function. 
Its primary activities are to manage the Group’s 
liquidity, funding requirements and ﬁ nancial risk, 
principally arising from movements in interest and 
foreign currency exchange rates. The Group’s policy 
is to ensure that adequate liquidity and ﬁ nancial 
resource is available to support the Group’s 
continuing activities and growth whilst managing 
these risks. The Group’s policy is not to engage in 
speculative transactions. Group Treasury operates 
as a service centre within clearly deﬁ ned objectives 
and controls and is subject to periodic review by 
internal audit.
Foreign currency risk
The net assets of foreign subsidiaries represent a 
signiﬁ cant portion of the Group’s shareholders’ 
funds and a substantial percentage of the Group’s 
revenue and operating costs are incurred in 
currencies other than sterling. Because of the high 
proportion of international activity, the Group’s 
proﬁ t is exposed to exchange rate ﬂ uctuations. Two 
types of risk arise as a result: (i) translation risk, that 
is, the risk of adverse currency ﬂ uctuations in the 
translation of foreign currency operations and 
foreign assets and liabilities into sterling and (ii) 
transaction risk, that is, the risk that currency 
ﬂ uctuations will have a negative effect on the 
value of the Group’s commercial cash ﬂ ows in 
various currencies. 
Translation risk
The results of the Group’s overseas activities are 
translated into sterling using the cumulative 
average exchange rates for the period concerned. 
The balance sheets of overseas subsidiaries are 
translated at actual exchange rates.
Material changes in the exchange rates can create 
volatility in the results when they are translated at 
actual exchange rates. In order to mitigate this 
translation exposure, the Group’s policy is to match 
the currency of external borrowings to the currency 
of expected cashﬂ ows and the currency of net 
investments. At 31 December 2006, 73.2% of the 
Group’s borrowings were denominated in US 
dollars and Hong Kong dollars. 14 Intertek Group plc Annual Report
Transaction risk
The Group’s policy requires overseas subsidiaries 
to hedge all signiﬁ cant transaction exposures with 
Group Treasury where they are managed centrally. 
Subsidiaries’ transaction exposures include 
committed foreign currency sales and purchases 
together with the anticipated transactions 
reasonably expected to occur during future periods. 
The Group’s policy is also to hedge transaction 
exposures arising from the remittance of overseas 
dividends and interest as soon as they are 
committed. Transaction exposures are hedged 
forward using forward currency contracts.
Interest rate risk and exposure
The Group’s policy is to maintain an appropriate 
balance of ﬁ xed and variable rate debt to minimise 
interest expense while managing interest rate 
exposure. This balance will be periodically adjusted 
on the basis of prevailing and anticipated market 
conditions and the Group’s gearing and interest 
cover, which are monitored by Group Treasury. 
Details of the interest rate hedges in place at 
31 December 2006 are given in note 26 to the 
ﬁ nancial statements.
Liquidity risk
The multi-currency senior debt facility that was 
placed in December 2004 was originally due to 
expire on 15 December 2009, however the Group 
exercised its option to extend the facility by a year 
in 2005 and by a further year in 2006, so the 
facility now expires in December 2011. The margins 
currently paid on borrowings are in the range of 
0.3% to 0.5% over LIBOR. 
 
At 31 December 2006, there was £178.4m of debt 
outstanding (2005: £190.7m) and the undrawn 
committed borrowing facilities were £86.4m 
(2005: £95.5m) having taken into account £7.1m 
(2005: £5.8m) utilised for letters of credit and 
guarantees. These facilities are expected to be 
adequate to support the Group’s medium-term 
funding requirements. Surplus cash is placed on 
deposit with short-term maturities providing 
liquidity when required.
Counterparty credit risk
The Group monitors the distribution of cash 
deposits, borrowings and hedging instruments 
which are assigned to each of the Group’s 
counterparties and which are subject to 
periodic review.
Tax risk
The Group operates in 109 countries and is subject 
to wide range of complex tax laws and regulations. 
At any point in time it is normal for there to be a 
number of open years in any particular territory 
which may or may not be subject to enquiry by 
local authorities. Where the effect of the laws 
and regulations is unclear, estimates are used 
in determining the liability for the tax to be paid 
on past proﬁ ts which are recognised in the 
ﬁ nancial statements. The Group considers the 
estimates, assumptions and judgments to be 
reasonable but this can involve complex issues 
which may take a number of years to resolve. 
The ﬁ nal determination of prior year tax liabilities 
could be different from the estimates reﬂ ected 
in the ﬁ nancial statements. 
Risk of litigation
The Group is regularly notiﬁ ed of, or involved in, 
a number of claims and proceedings which are 
incidental to its ordinary course of business. Claims 
can arise in the context of a dispute between the 
parties to a commercial transaction in which the 
Group has provided testing, inspection or 
certiﬁ cation services. Often the Group’s role in the 
transaction will be incidental to the underlying 
dispute, but the claim will be notiﬁ ed to the Group 
in order to toll the relevant statute of limitations in 
respect of such a claim. In certain situations, a claim 
may only be notiﬁ ed to the Group after resolution 
of the underlying commercial dispute and, in such 
cases, a considerable period of time may elapse 
between the performance of services by the Group 
and the assertion of a claim in respect of such 
services. In either case, because the underlying 
commercial transaction can be of signiﬁ cant value, 
the claims notiﬁ ed to the Group can allege 
substantial damages. 
The Group’s policy is to maintain insurance against 
potential claims, however there can be no 
assurance that claims brought against the Group 
will always be covered by insurance, or that such 
insurance, if available, will be sufﬁ cient to cover 
fully the damages or other expenses which the 
Group may be required to pay. 
Environmental risks
Intertek operates facilities in 109 countries which 
are subject to local environmental and political 
factors. Disasters such as ﬁ re, hurricanes, ﬂ oods 
and earthquakes can cause damage to property 
and personnel and can disrupt operations, causing 
loss of revenue. The Group maintains disaster 
recovery plans for such events and endeavours to 
ensure that adequate insurance is in place. The 
Group’s impact on the environment is described 
on page 37. 
The Group operates in some countries where there 
is risk of political instability which can make it 
difﬁ cult to operate. In particular, government 
contracts in the Government Services division can 
be subject to change or termination at short notice.

Consumer Goods
Commercial & Electrical
Business review by division
The key growth drivers in Consumer Goods 
remain strong, principally the sourcing of 
products from China, the increasingly wide 
range of products being sold by retailers, shorter 
product lifecycles and the growth in demand from 
consumers and regulatory bodies for assurance of 
quality and safety. 
Companies are coming under increasing pressure 
to be socially responsible and the Consumer Goods 
division provides auditing and consultancy services 
in this sector. The division will continue to expand 
its network of facilities in 2007.

The Commercial & Electrical (ETL SEMKO) division 
provides services to a wide range of industries 
including those in the home appliances, medical, 
building, industrial and HVAC/R (heating, 
ventilation and air conditioning and refrigeration), 
IT and telecom and automotive sectors. Customers 
are mostly manufacturers but also retailers, industry 
organisations and government departments. 
Services include testing and certiﬁ cation, 
electromagnetic compatibility testing (EMC), 
systems auditing, outsourcing, benchmark and 
performance testing and environmental testing. 
The Group has the widest range of owned marks 
and accreditations, including the ETL listed mark 
and Warnock Hersey mark for North America and 
the S mark, as well as being a leader in the issuance 
of the CB certiﬁ cation mark and the CE mark and 
GS mark for Europe. 
The market for the services of the Commercial & 
Electrical division is driven by increasing regulations 
over the safety of products. This includes current 
concerns over climate change and the impact on the 
environment of electrical products. The division has 
a global strategy for each of its key industry sectors, 
for example expertise in the United States in 
automotive component testing and building 
products testing has been extended into China by 
the opening of a new automotive facility in Shanghai 
and a building products facility in Guangzhou. 
The Commercial & Electrical division performed well in 
2006, with revenue growth of 15.6% and operating 
proﬁ t growth of 17.6%. The operating margin 
increased by 30 basis points to 15.3%. All service 
sectors performed well apart from automotive 
component testing, which suffered from the decline 
in the domestic motor industry in the United States. 
On an organic basis, revenue increased by 8.7% and 
operating proﬁ t increased by 6.7%.

The Consumer Goods (Labtest) division provides 
services to the textiles, toys, footwear, hardlines, 
food and retail industries. Services include testing, 
inspection, auditing, advisory services, quality 
assurance and hazardous substance testing. 
Customers are often retailers but can include 
manufacturers and suppliers within a global 
supply chain.
The market for the services of the Consumer Goods 
division is diverse. Demand is driven by retailers who 
require the goods they sell to be produced to a 
quality set by either their own internal standards or 
by legislation in a particular country. Increasingly, 
goods are manufactured in locations that are remote 
from the eventual consumer, causing supply chains 
to be longer and more complicated. The market is 
increasingly being driven by regulations issued to 
address safety and environmental concerns over such 
issues as carcinogenic dyes in textiles and chemicals 
in toys and cosmetics. 
The Consumer Goods division performed well 
in 2006, with revenue growth of 13.5% and 
operating proﬁ t growth of 12.0%. The high 
operating margin in Consumer Goods was 
maintained at over 30% but decreased 40 basis 
points over last year. Most of this decline was 
attributable to the lower margin equipment and 
building inspection business that was acquired last 
year. On an organic basis, revenue growth was 
11.9% and operating proﬁ t growth was 11.8%. 
Toys, food and hardlines grew particularly well, 
driven in part by an increase in the testing of 
hazardous substances caused by a European Union 
directive, which became mandatory on 1 July 2006. 
The global textile market continued to be unsettled 
by the impact of changes in import quotas but 
despite these challenging market conditions, 
revenue from textile testing grew well in key 
countries such as China and India. The volume 
of textile testing in Europe remained stagnant 
as the market shifted increasingly to Asia and 
Latin America. 
Over 60% of the revenue in Consumer Goods 
is generated in China, Hong Kong and Taiwan. 
Revenue from these countries grew well and 
prospects continue to look good. The textile 
laboratory network was expanded with new 
facilities in India, Guatemala and Vietnam 
and three new laboratories in China. 16 Intertek Group plc Annual Report
Oil, Chemical & Agri
Business review by division
The electrical, building products and HVAC/R 
businesses grew strongly, with double digit organic 
revenue growth. Revenue from the operations in 
mainland China continued to grow strongly and the 
network was extended by the opening of six ofﬁ ces 
and four laboratories in China. Two ofﬁ ces were 
also opened in India. 
In February 2006, the Japanese EMC business of 
Akzo Nobel was acquired. Japan is an important 
market for Commercial & Electrical and this 
acquisition will allow quicker penetration of that 
market for both EMC testing and other services 
offered by the Group. This business performed well 
in 2006. The division also acquired a small electrical 
testing business in Italy during the year.
Customer demand for safe, energy efﬁ cient 
products continues to increase and the market 
for Commercial & Electrical continues to evolve 
which presents opportunities for growth. 
Concerns over global warming and climate 
change are driving new directives regarding 
the energy usage of products. This is evident in 
the HVAC/R industry and is expected to extend 
over other industry sectors. There are many small 
niche players in the market and this provides 
opportunities for bolt-on acquisitions.

The Oil, Chemical & Agri (Caleb Brett) division 
offers independent cargo inspection, testing 
and analytical services to the oil and chemical, 
agricultural, mineral and pharmaceutical sectors. 
Global customers include the major oil companies 
and leading chemical companies and the division 
also provides outsourcing services to many other 
major manufacturers. 
The cargo inspection and testing market is a well 
established global market in which Intertek is one 
of the leading service providers. High barriers to 
entry are principally due to the ﬁ xed costs required 
in establishing a global network of operations 
and laboratories. The analytical services market 
continues to expand driven by the increasing 
demand from industries which seek to outsource 
non-core services including testing. The more 
stringent environmental and regulatory 
requirements for fossil fuels and the drive for 
seeking alternative energy sources are expanding 
the market for testing services. Intertek developed 
outsourcing initially in the oil sector, but now 
is extending its reach to the chemical, 
pharmaceutical, biotech, automotive and minerals 
industries. Intertek’s successful track record is 
creating more opportunities and has reinforced 
Intertek as the market leader in laboratory 
outsourcing in the oil and chemical sector. 
Oil, Chemical & Agri had an excellent performance 
in 2006 with revenue growth of 29.1%, operating 
proﬁ t growth of 67.6% and an increase in margin 
from 8.2% to 10.7%. On an organic basis, revenue 
growth was 17.5% and operating proﬁ t growth 
was 52.1%. Excluding the impact of the hurricane 
which affected the 2005 results, organic revenue 
increased by 16.5% and organic operating proﬁ t 
increased by 27.0%. All service sectors contributed 
to this growth. With high volumes of trade and 
increased demand for petroleum products, market 
conditions were favourable and increased trading 
activity was evident across all regions. Demand for 
analytical services increased, in part due to the 
expansion of the global biofuels market and from 
new environmental regulations coming into force 
for road and marine fuels. Revenue from analytical 
services as a percentage of total revenues grew 
to 43% in 2006 up from 36% in 2005. 
In the Americas, revenue grew strongly, led by 
the US cargo inspection and testing business with 
market expansion throughout the US as well as 
in Latin America. An early investment in multiple 
facilities for testing ultra low sulphur diesel paid off, 
as demand was strong, driven by the requirement 
to comply with new US regulations. Demand was 
also strong for ethanol testing due to a change in 
regulations regarding the use of ethanol as an 
additive to petrol.
In Europe, revenue growth was assisted by the full 
implementation of outsourced analytical contracts 
which were awarded in 2005. Downstream, two 
new contracts for a biofuels plant and a reﬁ nery in 
the UK were won. A new contract was also awarded 
by BP to provide upstream analytical and technical 
support services to all offshore and onshore oil and 
gas production facilities in the North Sea.  17 Intertek Group plc Annual Report
Government Services
In Asia, new minerals testing and agri services 
were established to take advantage of the growth 
in these sectors. Upstream oil and gas services 
capabilities were expanded utilising the support 
and technology from the Westport laboratory in 
the US, which was acquired from Halliburton at 
the end of 2005. 
 
The division continued its strategy of extending 
its service offering by acquiring companies with 
specialist skills that complement the existing 
business and can be leveraged to existing and 
new clients through the Group’s global network. 
Details of the larger acquisitions are given below.
From 1 September 2006, under an outsourcing 
agreement, Intertek began providing all of the 
analytical service support to the manufacturing 
operations of Sabic and DSM in the Netherlands. 
This is one of the largest outsourcing contracts 
for analytical services within the chemical industry 
to date, with over 170 chemists and technicians 
joining Intertek.
In November 2006, the Group acquired the 
bioanalytical divisions of Alta Analytical Laboratory 
Inc., which is based in California, USA. Alta 
provides analytical services to North American 
pharmaceutical and clinical research organisations 
and provides Intertek with a platform to build a 
global presence in this area.
In December 2006, the Group acquired Caleb Brett 
Iberica, a leading testing and inspection business in 
Spain and Portugal, providing technical inspections 
and fuel analysis services to petroleum, chemical and 
fuel retailer clients. This acquisition provides the 
Group with the opportunity to extend its full range 
of services into this strategically important region.
In January 2007, the Group acquired Umitek Ltd 
and its subsidiaries, CAPCIS and Smith Rea Energy 
Ltd (SREL) in the UK, which provide specialist 
testing and consultancy services to the oil and gas 
industries in the North Sea and globally. These 
businesses will allow the Group to extend the range 
of services provided by Intertek’s current upstream 
operations to Europe and the Middle East.
The outlook for Oil, Chemical & Agri is positive with 
oil price volatility expected to continue generating 
trading opportunities requiring third party 
inspection and testing and continued expansion 
of the analytical services business driven by new 
regulations. The pipeline of potential outsourcing 
projects remains strong and the strategy of 
supplementing organic growth with acquisitions 
will continue.

The Government Services (FTS) division offers 
a range of services to governments, national 
standards organisations, customs departments 
and industrial companies. Services offered include 
ensuring imports comply with relevant safety, 
quality and other standards. Goods and 
commodities are tested and/or inspected prior 
to shipment which prevents dumping of unsafe 
goods and improves the quality of imported and 
sold goods. Ministries of Finance retain services to 
increase import duty and help improve efﬁ ciency. 
Imports are inspected and valued in the country 
before shipment to enable import duties to be 
accurately assessed and certiﬁ ed. Container 
scanning services are offered to help protect 
against security risks associated with international 
trade. Intertek’s worldwide laboratory coverage 
allows for rapid inspection, certiﬁ cation and 
valuation of shipments, anywhere in the world.
Most of the customers of the Government 
Services division are governments or departments 
linked to governments in countries which do not 
have the necessary infrastructure to enforce import 
controls effectively. 
As expected, the cessation of pre-shipment 
inspection contracts in Nigeria and Venezuela had 
an adverse effect on the division’s performance in 
2006. Revenue in 2006 was 28.3% lower than the 
previous year and operating proﬁ t declined 59.5% 
due to the loss of proﬁ t from those contracts and 
the lost contribution towards overheads. The 
operating margin reduced from 21.9% to 12.4%. 
The division was restructured to minimise its cost 
base, incurring costs of £0.3m (2005: £2.0m). 
Standards contracts in Nigeria and Kenya which 
started at the end of 2005 were fully operational 
in 2006 and performed well. A new container 
scanning contract with the Guinean Ministries of 
Transport and Finance commenced operation in 
the second half of 2006 and will run for ten years.
The Government Services division will continue 
to work with governments to develop innovative 
programmes that are tailored to their speciﬁ c 
requirements. There are a number of potential 
opportunities for new contracts, particularly in 
the areas of container scanning and standards 
programmes. 18 Intertek Group plc Annual Report

Statement of Directors’ responsibilities in respect of the 
Annual Report and the ﬁ nancial statements 
The Directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report and the 
Group and Parent Company ﬁ nancial statements, in accordance with 
applicable law and regulations. 
Company law requires the Directors to prepare Group and Parent 
Company ﬁ nancial statements for each ﬁ nancial year. Under that 
law, the Directors are required to prepare the Group ﬁ nancial 
statements in accordance with IFRS as adopted by the EU and 
applicable law and have elected to prepare the Parent Company 
ﬁ nancial statements in accordance with UK Accounting Standards 
and applicable law (UK Generally Accepted Accounting Practice). 
The Group ﬁ nancial statements are required by law and IFRS as 
adopted by the EU to present fairly the ﬁ nancial position and 
performance of the Group; the Companies Act 1985 provides in 
relation to such ﬁ nancial statements that references in the relevant 
part of that Act to ﬁ nancial statements giving a true and fair view 
are references to their achieving a fair presentation. 
The Parent Company ﬁ nancial statements are required by law to give 
a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the Parent Company.
In preparing each of the Group and Parent Company ﬁ nancial 
statements, the Directors are required to: 
• select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently; 
• make judgments and estimates that are reasonable and prudent; 
•  for the Group ﬁ nancial statements, state whether they have been 
prepared in accordance with IFRS as adopted by the EU; 
•  for the Parent Company ﬁ nancial statements, state whether 
applicable UK Accounting Standards have been followed, subject 
to any material departures disclosed and explained in the Parent 
Company ﬁ nancial statements; and 
•  prepare the ﬁ nancial statements on the going concern basis unless it 
is inappropriate to presume that the Group and the Parent Company 
will continue in business.
The Directors are responsible for keeping proper accounting records 
that disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the ﬁ nancial 
position of the Parent Company and enable them to ensure that its 
ﬁ nancial statements comply with the Companies Act 1985. They have 
general responsibility for taking such steps as are reasonably open to 
them to safeguard the assets of the Group and to prevent and detect 
fraud and other irregularities. 
The Directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity of 
the corporate and ﬁ nancial information included on the Company’s 
website. Legislation in the UK governing the preparation and 
dissemination of ﬁ nancial statements may differ from legislation 
in other jurisdictions.

Remuneration report
This report sets out the Group’s policy and disclosures in relation 
to Directors’ remuneration for the year ended 31 December 2006. 
As required by schedule 7A to the Companies Act 1985 and the 
Directors’ Remuneration Report Regulations 2002 (the Regulations), 
this report will be subject to shareholder vote at the forthcoming 
Annual General Meeting (AGM). The report complies fully with the 
requirements of the Regulations and the Combined Code (the Code) 
and has been audited by KPMG Audit Plc to the extent required by 
the Regulations. 
The Group has applied the Principles of Good Corporate Governance 
relating to the remuneration of its Directors and this report outlines 
how the Group has complied with the provisions of the Code as well 
as some of the guidelines issued by institutional bodies.
Remuneration Committee (the Committee)
The Committee determines, on behalf of the Board, the Company’s 
policy on the remuneration of Executive Directors and senior 
executives. The Committee determines their total remuneration 
packages, including any compensation on termination of ofﬁ ce and 
also provides advice to, and consults with, the Chief Executive Ofﬁ cer 
on major policy issues affecting the remuneration of senior executives. 
It keeps the remuneration policy continually under review in light of 
regulatory and best practice developments and shareholder 
expectations. Due regard is given to the interests of shareholders 
and the requirements of the Listing Rules and associated guidance.
To ensure that the Group’s remuneration practices are market 
competitive and to help achieve its objectives, the Committee 
requests information from various independent sources. The 
Committee has appointed and taken independent advice from New 
Bridge Street Consultants LLP (New Bridge Street), in relation to 
remuneration matters and share incentive arrangements and from 
Premier Pensions Management Limited (PPM) in relation to UK 
pension matters. Neither PPM nor New Bridge Street have any other 
connection with the Company. 
The Committee met ﬁ ve times during 2006.
The Remuneration Committee comprised the following Non-Executive 
Directors of the Company:
DP Allvey (Chairman)
VE Treves
CJ Knight (appointed 30 March 2006)
The Committee members have no personal ﬁ nancial interest, other 
than as shareholders, in the matters to be decided. No Director plays 
a part in any discussion about his or her own remuneration. 
Remuneration policy
The Committee considers that the Company’s long-term success 
is dependant on its ability to attract, retain, motivate and reward 
high calibre individuals to deliver superior performance both in the 
short and long-term. Its aim is to promote a performance-driven 
culture by maintaining a competitive package of pay and beneﬁ ts, 
commensurate with comparable packages of pay and beneﬁ ts 
provided by other companies of comparable size and complexity in 
the FTSE 250 index. For overseas executives, the objective is to provide 
a competitive package that is commensurate with packages paid to 
employees of other overseas organisations doing a similar sized job 
in that region. 
The Group is an international service business deriving signiﬁ cant 
amounts of its revenue from Asia (34%) and the Americas (37%). 
The international nature and complexity of the Group are reﬂ ected 
in salary policy, requiring alignment with the relevant median in 
order to retain and attract the right people. Exceptional performance 
on the part of both the Group and individual can deliver upper 
quartile remuneration. This direct alignment with performance 
is considered by the Committee to be clearly in the interests of 
shareholders and provides the senior executives with unambiguous 
signals about the importance of delivering success to the Company’s 
shareholders in both the short and long-term.
In February 2007, the Committee reviewed the Group’s remuneration 
policy for its Executive Directors and senior executives, taking into 
account external developments in executive pay, to ensure that the 
policy remained appropriate in the light of the Group’s business needs 
and future strategy and is competitive. Following the review, the 
Committee has made changes to increase the performance related 
element of remuneration for the Executive Directors and senior 
executives within the context of the existing remuneration strategy.  
From 2007, the maximum cash bonus potential will increase in the 
case of the Chief Executive Ofﬁ cer to 75% of base salary, and in the 
cases of the Chief Financial Ofﬁ cer and Executive Vice Presidents, to 
60% of base salary. The 2007 bonus targets have also been reviewed 
to ensure that they are sufﬁ ciently stretching to align the interests of 
the Executive Directors and senior executives with those of the 
Company’s shareholders.
Executive Directors
The total remuneration package for Executive Directors comprises 
the following principal elements:
base salary;
annual bonus plan;
 subsisting rights under the Intertek Share Schemes and individual 
arrangements;
pension; and
 other beneﬁ ts which may include travel, school fees, car 
allowances, permanent health, life and private medical insurance.
Base salary 
The base salary is set by the Committee and annual increases are 
linked to:
annual market movement;
the size and complexity of the business; and
 demonstrable efforts and results of an individual in contributing 
to the building of Intertek Group efﬁ ciency, synergy and strategy.
When the Committee takes into account any benchmarking, it 
reviews the performance of the individual concerned against the 
parameters outlined above, to ensure that there is no upward 
ratchet in remuneration without a corresponding requirement for 
improvement in those parameters given above. Where a decision is 
made to increase base salary over the amount suggested by annual 
market movements, the Committee will expect the individual’s 
performance, taking into account levels of experience, to have 
demonstrably shown good and solid leadership within the business 
and a results-orientated approach, as well as considering the 
requirement to retain senior executives. Also, when determining salary 
increases for Executive Directors, the Committee is sensitive to pay 
and employment conditions elsewhere in the Group. The salary 
increases granted to the Executive Directors during the year reﬂ ect 
recognition of achievement ahead of expectations and retention 
requirements.
The Remuneration Committee reviews the balance between base 
and performance-related beneﬁ ts when agreeing each individual’s 
performance-related arrangements and aims to achieve alignment 
of rewards with shareholder interests.

Performance bonuses
The Executive Directors and senior executives are eligible for annual incentive payments for the achievement of annual ﬁ nancial and strategic 
goals of the Group and its businesses. The ﬁ nancial targets are derived from the stretch goals determined by the annual planning process for 
the Group and its businesses which are the cornerstone of the Group’s results culture. Executive Directors’ and senior executive’s bonus criteria 
contain two or more of the following:
(i)  Group performance elements; 
(ii) divisional performance elements; and 
(iii)  discretionary elements. 
The table below shows the relevant proportions for different groups of executive.
 Executive Directors Senior executives
 Chief Executive   Chief Financial  Executive Vice  Divisional Vice  Group Vice
 Ofﬁ cer  Ofﬁ cer  Presidents  Presidents  Presidents
Group performance 90%  90%  25%  15%  50%
Divisional performance –  –  65%  75%  40%*
Discretionary 10%  10%  10%  10%  10%
* speciﬁ ed personal objectives.
During 2006 the Group Performance bonus targets focused on increasing earnings per share (EPS), operating proﬁ t, operating cash ﬂ ow as 
a percentage of operating proﬁ t and return on business assets, compared to the previous year. Each year, the Committee reviews the bonus 
targets used to ensure that they remain relevant and appropriate for the Group.
The following table shows the weighting of the Group Performance element of bonus for all Executive Directors and senior executives for 2006:
         Maximum
         percentage
         of Group
Growth measure        Notes bonus
EPS        1 50%
Operating proﬁ t         2 25%
Operating cash ﬂ ow/operating proﬁ t        2 15%
Return on business assets         10%
Total         100%
1. Diluted adjusted EPS.
2. Operating proﬁ t excluding amortisation of business combination intangibles, and goodwill impairment, translated at constant currency.
For each growth measure, three targets are set and a ﬁ xed proportion of the maximum percentage of bonus available is applicable at each 
target level. Pro-rata awards will be made for achievement between the targets. Awards are applied to current base salary.
The divisional elements of bonus are based upon similar ﬁ nancial performance indicators for each division but with targets appropriate to that division.
All targets are established and approved by the Committee. Based on the above measures for 2006, cash bonuses of 47.4% and 37.1% of 
salary will be paid to WG Hauser and W Spencer respectively. Bonuses are not pensionable.
The sum to be paid under the discretionary element, of up to 10% of total bonus, is determined by taking into account the overall personal 
contribution of the executive to the goals and results of the Group for the year, the development of the medium-term strategy of the Group, 
the achievement over the year of strategic objectives and demonstrable efforts and results in team building and leadership. The Committee 
recognises its responsibility to shareholders to use its discretion in a reasonable and informed manner and in the Group’s interests, and to be 
accountable and transparent in the exercise of that discretion. 
The Committee can additionally award a discretionary payment where circumstances have occurred which were beyond the direct control of 
the executive and the executive has managed and mitigated the impact of any loss, or where circumstances have arisen outside the Group’s 
control and the Committee feels that payment is necessary to retain and motivate the executive concerned.
The Committee has the discretion to reduce bonus payments if it believes that short-term performance has been achieved at the expense 
of the Group’s long-term future or vice versa. In future, the Committee will also retain discretion to reduce or reclaim payments if the 
performance achievements are subsequently found to have been signiﬁ cantly misstated. 
The maximum annual cash bonus potential for the year under review was:
 
Chief Executive Ofﬁ cer   50% of salary 
Executive Director   40% of salary
Executive Vice Presidents   40% of salary
Regional and Group Vice Presidents  30%–50% of salary 24 Intertek Group plc Annual Report
Remuneration report
Non-Executive Directors
The Board determines the remuneration of the Non-Executive Directors 
of the Company, for their work as Directors and as Committee 
members. Their remuneration is assessed relative to the Group’s peer 
groups and following a review, fees increased during the year, as 
disclosed in the notes to the Directors’ remuneration summary on 
page 27. Remuneration is neither pensionable nor eligible for annual 
incentive payments. The Non-Executive Directors are not allowed to 
participate in the Company’s share incentive plans. Other than VE 
Treves, who has the beneﬁ t of a company car, and RC Nelson, for 
whom the Group maintains a life insurance policy in accordance with 
the terms of his previous employment contract with the Company, 
no other beneﬁ ts-in-kind are provided.
Service contracts
Details of the service contracts currently in place for Directors who 
have served during the year are as follows:
Executive Directors
WG Hauser has a service contract dated 1 March 2005; W Spencer 
has a service contract dated 24 May 2002. Both have 12-month rolling 
contracts terminable by either party on 12 months’ notice and contain 
provisions by way of compensation for loss of ofﬁ ce, limited to 
payment of salary and bonus over a 12-month period, and beneﬁ ts in 
lieu of notice. WG Hauser’s contract permits payments in lieu of notice 
to be made, at the Company’s election, either (a) in full on termination 
or (b) on a monthly basis, but only for so long as he receives no 
remuneration from any other business. If WG Hauser does receive 
any such remuneration, the monthly amount payable will be reduced 
by that remuneration, determined on a monthly basis. Neither service 
contract contains provisions regarding a change of control. R Kong 
ceased to be an Executive Director on 30 June 2006 and became a 
Non-Executive Director on 1 July 2006.
Non-Executive Directors
The Non-Executive Directors do not have service contracts with the 
Company. The letter of engagement for each Non-Executive Director 
states that they are appointed for an initial period of three years and 
all appointments are terminable by either one or three months’ notice 
on either side. At the end of the initial period the appointment may be 
renewed for a further period if the Company and the Director agree. 
The Non-Executive Directors are typically expected to serve two 
of these three-year terms. Each letter of engagement states that 
should the Group terminate the appointment, on such termination 
the Non-Executive Director will not be entitled to any compensation 
for loss of ofﬁ ce. 
VE Treves and DJ Allvey are each engaged by the Group as Non-
Executive Directors under the terms of a letter of appointment 
commencing 24 May 2002. Both appointments were renewed 
for three years at the end of their three-year initial periods. 
RC Nelson is engaged by the Group as a Non-Executive Director 
under the terms of a letter of appointment for an initial period of 
three years commencing 8 April 2005. Under the terms of the same 
letter of appointment RC Nelson is entitled to remuneration of 
£1,000 per working day for any special project work agreed in 
advance by the Chairman.
D Rade is engaged by the Group as a Non-Executive Director under 
the terms of a letter of appointment for an initial period of three years 
commencing 1 January 2006. 
CJ Knight is engaged by the Group as a Non-Executive Director under 
the terms of a letter of appointment for an initial period of three years 
commencing 30 March 2006. 
R Kong is engaged by the Group as a Non-Executive Director under 
the terms of a letter of appointment commencing 1 July 2006. On the 
same date, R Kong entered into an agreement to provide independent 
professional consultancy services to Intertek Testing Services Paciﬁ c 
Limited, as and when required by the Chief Executive Ofﬁ cer of that 
company. The agreement is terminable at one month’s notice without 
compensation for loss of ofﬁ ce and R Kong’s remuneration thereunder 
is £1,000 per working day.

table on page 27. Following the review of fees in 2006, the Chairman 
is paid £110,000 per annum, the Deputy Chairman is paid £50,000 
per annum and each Non–Executive Director is paid fees of £40,000 
per annum. Additional fees of £10,000 per annum in aggregate are 
payable to Non-Executive Directors who serve on the Audit and 
Risk Committee, Remuneration and Nomination Committees. An 
additional fee of £20,000 per annum in aggregate is payable to the 
Chairman of the Remuneration and Audit and Risk Committees. 
Policy on external appointments
The Company recognises that, during their employment with the 
Company, Executive Directors may be invited to become Non-
Executive Directors of other companies and that such duties can 
broaden their experience and knowledge. Executive Directors may, 
with written consent of the Company, accept such appointments 
outside the Company, and the policy is that any fees may be retained. 
WG Hauser was Chairman of an advisory consultancy board of 
Dragenopharm GmbH & Co KG in 2006. On 1 January 2007 he 
joined the Board of LogicaCMG plc as a Non-Executive Director.
Share incentives 
The Company believes that share ownership by employees is an integral 
part of its programme to incentivise, reward and retain employees as 
it strengthens the link between employees’ personal interests and 
those of shareholders and enables them to beneﬁ t from the growth 
of the Company. In order to encourage share ownership, the Company 
established a share option scheme for executives in March 1997. This 
scheme was discontinued and replaced by the Intertek Group plc 
2002 Share Option Plan (the 2002 Plan) and the Intertek Group plc 
2002 Approved Share Option Plan (the Approved Plan) on 9 May 
2002, under which options were granted by either the Company or 
the Employee Share Ownership Trust on the recommendation of the 
Remuneration Committee. All awards were discretionary. 
The Intertek Deferred Bonus Plan (the Plan) was approved in 2005 and 
supersedes all previous executive share option plans, creating more 
effectively rewarded management throughout the Group’s global 
operations by linking rewards to the achievement of targets which are 
directly relevant to them. During 2006 the ﬁ rst awards were made 
under the Plan, based on bonuses payable in respect of the ﬁ nancial 
year ended 31 December 2005.
The Committee regularly reviews the appropriateness of the 
Company’s share incentive arrangements and targets to ensure that 
they remain stretching. It considers that the existing performance 
conditions and vesting schedules remain appropriate and in line with 
the Company’s current circumstances, business outlook and strategy. 
Share retention
A shareholding retention requirement for the Executive Management 
Board (the EMB, which comprises the Executive Directors and Executive 
Vice Presidents), and Intertek Council (the IC, which comprises the 
Group’s most senior executives) has been set by the Committee.  25 Intertek Group plc Annual Report
The members of the EMB are now expected, within ﬁ ve years, to build 
up a shareholding in the Company worth at least 100% of base salary 
and members of the IC are expected to build up a shareholding worth 
at least 35% of base salary. To assist in the building of this holding, it is 
expected that, after allowing for tax and similar liabilities, 100% of the 
shares subject to each vested award under the Plan will be retained by 
the executive until the ownership target is attained. 
The Company does not operate any long-term share incentive plans 
other than those described below. Other than as stated above, no 
signiﬁ cant amendments are proposed to be made to the terms and 
conditions of any entitlement of a Director to share incentives.
The 2005 Deferred Bonus Plan (the Plan) 
The purpose of the Plan is to assist in the retention of senior 
executives and to align their interests with shareholders by their 
participation in share price performance. 
Grant of Awards
The Plan has two elements:
 Deferred Shares are awarded to executives based on their annual 
bonus achievements. They will therefore be rewarded for the 
achievement of performance which is directly within their sphere 
of inﬂ uence. The Committee believes that this provides a simple 
and well-targeted form of reward.
 Matching Shares, at the discretion of the Committee, are awarded 
to the senior executives. Awards of Matching Shares are linked to 
awards of Deferred Shares and vest after three years depending on 
the Company’s relative Total Shareholder Return (TSR) measured 
against the FTSE Mid 250, in conjunction with an underlying 
increase in Earnings Per Share (EPS). This measure of performance 
is considered relevant to the most senior executives in the Group
and contributes to the alignment of interests between executives 
and shareholders.
Awards are not pensionable.
Scheme Limit 
The Company has undertaken to limit the number of awards granted 
under the Plan in a ten-year period to 5% of the Company’s issued 
share capital. In 2006 the awards granted amounted to 0.24% of the 
Company’s issued share capital as at 31 December 2006.
Individual Limits 
Deferred Awards
The annual maximum value of Deferred Awards will be the amount 
of the annual cash bonus to which it is linked or 50% of basic salary, 
whichever is the lower. In certain exceptional circumstances, such as 
recruitment or retention, the Committee has the discretion to make 
an award of Deferred Shares which is not linked to the achievement 
of the annual bonus but the same maximum salary limit will apply. 
Matching Awards 
The maximum number of Matching Shares which may be awarded 
to an individual is twice the number of their corresponding Deferred 
Award (i.e. a 2:1 match). It is currently intended that this level of 
Matching Shares will be awarded only to members of the EMB and 
the level will be 1:1 for the IC.
The ﬁ rst awards of Deferred Shares made on 7 April 2006 were 
conditional awards and were based on bonuses for the year ended 
31 December 2005. The next awards of Deferred Shares will be made 
in or around March 2007 and will be based on bonuses for the year 
ended 31 December 2006.

Vesting of Awards
Deferred Awards
Deferred Awards will normally vest on the third anniversary of grant 
provided the participant is still employed in the Group.
Matching Awards
Matching Awards will normally vest on the third anniversary of grant 
once the Committee has determined the extent to which the 
applicable performance conditions have been satisﬁ ed and provided 
the participant is still employed in the Group.
Leaving employment
If a participant leaves employment because of death, disability, 
retirement, redundancy, disposal of the employing company or, at the 
discretion of the Committee, for any other reason, then the awards 
vest thus: (i) Deferred Awards will vest on a pro-rata basis on the 
date of cessation, although the Committee may decide not to 
pro-rate an award if it regards it as inappropriate to do so in the 
particular circumstances; (ii) Matching Awards will vest at the end 
of the period over which the performance conditions are measured, 
or the Committee may decide that the Matching Award will vest on 
cessation of employment. The extent to which a Matching Award will 
vest will depend upon the extent to which the performance conditions 
have been satisﬁ ed over the full performance period or up to the date 
of cessation as appropriate.
Performance Conditions
Deferred Awards
These are not subject to any performance conditions.
Matching Awards
All Matching Awards will be subject to performance conditions set by 
the Committee on each grant. The initial grant of Matching Awards 
was subject to a TSR condition which compares the TSR of the 
Company over a three-year performance period with the TSR of the 
FTSE Mid 250 (excluding investment trusts) as at the date of grant. 
The extent to which such Matching Awards will vest is as follows:
Company’s TSR ranking    
against the FTSE Mid 250    Percentage of
(excluding investment trusts)   Matching Award
over the performance period   that vests
Below median None
Median 25%
Between median and Pro-rata on a straight
upper quartile line between 25%
 and 100%
Upper quartile 100%
The performance period will be the three consecutive ﬁ nancial years 
starting with the ﬁ nancial year in which the grant is made. The 
relevant TSR ﬁ gures will be averaged over the three months prior to 
the start and end of the performance period. In addition, irrespective 
of the Company’s TSR performance, no part of a Matching Award 
will vest unless the Group’s normalised EPS growth over the 
performance period is, on average, at least 2% per annum above 
the UK Retail Price Index (RPI).
The Committee can set different performance conditions from those 
described above for future awards. Any such new targets will not, 
in the reasonable opinion of the Committee, be materially less 
challenging in the circumstances than those described above.  26 Intertek Group plc Annual Report
Remuneration report
Performance graph 
TSR, comprising the changes in value of a share and dividends distributed, can be represented by the value of a notional £100 invested at the 
beginning of a period and its change over that period.
The graph below shows TSR in respect of the Company since ﬂ otation on 24 May 2002. The TSR for the Company is compared with the TSR 
for the FTSE Mid 250 index. The FTSE Mid 250 index was selected, as it is a broad market index of which the Group is a member. In addition, 
the Group uses that group of companies, amongst others, for comparison of pay and beneﬁ t levels.

The Committee may also vary the performance conditions applying to 
existing awards to take account of events that the Committee considers 
to be exceptional, provided the Committee considers the varied 
condition is fair and reasonable and not materially less challenging than 
the original condition would have been but for the event in question.
The 2002 Share Option Plan (2002 Plan)
The 2002 Plan was introduced following the Company’s listing in 
2002. No options have been granted since 2005. Only Executive 
Directors or employees of the Group were eligible to participate in 
the 2002 Plan. The exercise price was determined by the average of 
the closing middle market quotations of an ordinary share in the 
Company on the ﬁ ve dealing days immediately prior to the date of 
grant and the options granted exercisable between three and ten 
years after the date of grant, provided the performance condition has 
been satisﬁ ed. The Committee decides whether the performance 
condition has been met at the appropriate time.
No options were granted in 2006, but prior to that there were annual 
grants with each tranche equating to approximately 1% of the 
Company’s issued share capital. No individual was granted options with 
a value of more than their annual base salary in each year. The options 
are subject to performance criteria unless there are regulatory or legal 
difﬁ culties in jurisdictions where the employee is based. The 
performance condition requires that the growth in the Company’s EPS 
outperforms the growth in the RPI by a minimum of 5% per annum 
over a three-year period. If the condition is met, 25% of the options 
become exercisable. If the growth rate is 8% over RPI then 66.6% of 
options become exercisable. 100% of the options would only become 
exercisable if the Company’s growth in EPS outperformed the growth 
in the RPI by 11% per annum over a three-year period. For growth rates 
between 5% and 8%, and 8% and 11%, the percentage of options 
exercisable is calculated on a sliding scale. In respect of options granted 
prior to 2005, if the performance targets are not met in full for the 
initial performance period of three years, the performance period may 
be extended by one further period of 12 months, to ascertain whether 
the balance of the unvested options can be exercised. The ﬁ nal grant of 
options under the Plan in 2005 did not have a re-testing provision. The 
above performance criteria were selected to closely link improvement in 
performance with increase in shareholder value.
Other than in the case of hardship, senior executives are required to 
retain 25% of their shares acquired upon the exercise of their options 
(ignoring shares sold to meet any tax liability and the ﬁ nancing cost 
on exercise), for a period of up to two years following exercise, in 
order to demonstrate their commitment to the Group.
The Approved Plan
The key features of the Approved Plan (which has been approved by 
the Inland Revenue) are broadly the same as for the 2002 Plan, except 
that options were granted subject to the requirement that the 
aggregate exercise price of all the subsisting options granted to an 
employee under the Approved Plan must not exceed £30,000.
No further awards are to be made under the 2002 Plan or the 
Approved Plan.  27 Intertek Group plc Annual Report

8.  Under the 2005 Deferred Bonus Plan, awards were made in 2006 to Executive Directors based on their 2005 bonuses. Deferred Awards were made in shares based on a 
share price of 827.6p. Deferred Awards vest in three years’ time, subject to continued employment. Matching Awards, which are subject to additional performance 
conditions, were also made. Similar awards will be made in 2007 based on 2006 bonuses.
Pensions 
In order to ensure that there is no adverse impact on liabilities, the Group has made certain modiﬁ cations to its UK pension schemes as a 
result of changes in UK pension legislation, which took effect from April 2006. The Committee continues to review the current liabilities under 
the deﬁ ned beneﬁ t section of the UK pension scheme and to monitor the effect of changes to future mortality rates and investment returns 
and how to limit the potential liability created by pension commitments. The majority of the Group’s employees are non-UK based and are 
therefore unaffected. Further details of the Group’s pension schemes, including the funding position, are disclosed in note 22 to the ﬁ nancial 
statements. Details of the pension arrangements for those who have served as Executive Directors during the ﬁ nancial year are shown below.
WG Hauser
WG Hauser is not a member of a Group company pension scheme. Instead, the Group contributes an amount equal to 20% of his base salary 
in respect of a personal pension arrangement. During 2006 this amounted to £86,000 (2005: £66,667). WG Hauser is entitled to a death-in-
service beneﬁ t comprising a lump sum payment equivalent to four times his base salary.  28 Intertek Group plc Annual Report
Remuneration report
W Spencer
W Spencer is a member of the deﬁ ned beneﬁ t section of the Intertek UK Company Pension Scheme. This is a deﬁ ned beneﬁ t and deﬁ ned 
contribution occupational pension scheme approved by the Inland Revenue. The main features of the deﬁ ned beneﬁ t section of the scheme are:
Normal retirement age 65
Annual pension at normal retirement age   1/60 of ﬁ nal pensionable salary (highest base salary in any 12-month period during the ﬁ ve 
years immediately preceding retirement date) for each year of service. Members may exchange 
part of their pension for a tax-free cash sum. This will reduce their pension but not that of 
their spouse.
Spouse’s or dependant’s pension payable 
on death of member  Half of member’s pension.
Early retirement   From age 50 onwards with the consent of the Company and the Trustees, based on accrued 
entitlement reduced by 4% for each year of retirement prior to age 65. With effect from 
6 April 2010, the minimum retirement age will increase to age 55.
Pension increases in payment or deferment I ncreases in deferment – revaluation is in two parts:
  i) The part that represents the Guaranteed Minimum Pension (GMP) will be increased at the 
rate of 4.5% for each complete tax year between date of leaving and State Pension Age.
  ii) The balance of the pension will increase at the rate of 2.5% per annum or in line with the 
Retail Price Index if lower for each completed year between the date of leaving and the 
Normal Retirement Date.
  Increases in retirement (or payment): 
 i) Pre 1997 excess pension beneﬁ ts will increase at the rate of 3% per annum.
  ii) 1997 to 2005, excess pension beneﬁ ts will increase at the rate of the lower of 5% per 
annum or the increases in Retail Price Index.
  iii) Post 2005 excess pension beneﬁ ts will increase at the rate of the lower of 2.5% per
annum or the increases in Retail Price Index.
 iv) Pre 1988 GMP 0% increase.
 v) Post 1988 GMP 3% per annum or increase in the Retail Price Index, if lower.
Employee contributions  As determined by the Company and the Trustees: currently 8.5% of base salary (excluding 
incentive payments) up to the earnings cap.
Employer contributions  As determined by the Company and the Trustees: currently 16% of base salary (excluding 
incentive payments) up to the earnings cap.
Ill health or incapacity  In the case of ill health, the pension is calculated as for early retirement but without the 4% 
reduction. In the case of incapacity the pension is calculated as if pensionable service had 
continued to normal retirement date.
Death in service  A member is entitled to either:
  i) a lump sum of four times pensionable salary plus spouse’s pension which is 50% of the 
member’s prospective pension at normal retirement date; or
  ii)  lump sum of eight times pensionable salary, but with no spouse’s pension (except for the 
contracting-out requirements). 29 Intertek Group plc Annual Report

1.  The accrued pension entitlement is the amount that would be paid each year on retirement at 65 based on service to 31 December 2006, excluding the effect of 
inﬂ ation. Including inﬂ ation, the increase was £2,468 during the year.
2.  Transfer values have been calculated in a manner consistent with “Retirement Beneﬁ t Schemes – Transfer Values (GN11)” last revised by the Institute of Actuaries and the 
Faculty of Actuaries on 30 December 2005. The transfer value disclosed above does not represent a sum paid or payable to the individual Director, instead it represents a 
potential liability of the Pension Scheme. The value represents the full transfer value without reduction for any shortfall in scheme funding.
3. The assumptions used to calculate transfer values were revised in May 2006, resulting in higher transfer values.
R Kong 
R Kong was a member of the Intertek Hong Kong Retirement Scheme (the ORSO Scheme) until his retirement on 30 June 2006. This is a hybrid 
scheme (combination of deﬁ ned beneﬁ t and deﬁ ned contribution beneﬁ t structure) registered under the Occupational Retirement Schemes 
Ordinance (ORSO) in Hong Kong. Following R Kong’s retirement on 30 June 2006, his membership in the ORSO ceased. No further 
contribution was made to the scheme and all his vested beneﬁ t was paid as a lump sum of £1,270,143 in July 2006. No other pension scheme 
arrangement was made for him after this date.
Details of the changes during the year and the lump sum beneﬁ t to which R Kong was entitled on leaving service are shown in the table below.

2. Includes foreign exchange currency translation difference of £77,491.
3.  For the year to 31 December 2005 the accrued entitlement referred to the lump sum payable to R Kong if he retired at age 60, based on his service to 31 December 
2005. Since R Kong was covered by a retirement scheme in Hong Kong, the above calculation took into account the economic conditions in Hong Kong. For the year 
to 31 December 2006 the accrued entitlement represents the actual lump sum to which R Kong was entitled on retirement.
4.  For the year to 31 December 2005 the transfer value disclosed was calculated in a manner consistent with “Retirement Beneﬁ t Schemes – Transfer Values (GN11)” 
published by the Institute of Actuaries and the Faculty of Actuaries dated 6 April 2001. To be consistent with the GN11, the transfer value was determined to be the past 
service liability based on the ORSO funding method and assumptions. For the year to 31 December 2006 the transfer value represents the actual lump sum to which 
R Kong was entitled on retirement.
Transactions with Directors 
These are disclosed in note 28 to the ﬁ nancial statements.
Directors’ interests in share options and long-term incentive plans
Non-Executive Directors are not allowed to participate in the Company’s share incentive plans. Following his retirement from executive service 
R Kong retained his interest under the Deferred Bonus Scheme. No options were granted to the Executive Directors under the 1997 Plan.

1.  The LTIP awards were made based on a share price of 827.6p, obtained by averaging the closing share prices for the ﬁ ve dealing days before the date of grant. At date 
of grant the share price was 831.0p.
2.  On becoming a Non-Executive Director, under the terms of his letter of engagement, Mr Kong was entitled to exercise up to 100%, subject to performance criteria, of 
the share options granted under the share plans, within three months from 30 June 2006. R Kong exercised share options totalling 118,734 on 5 July 2006 when the 
market price was 689p, and retained all the resultant 118,734 ordinary 1p shares. Of the April 2003 grant, the performance condition was only met as to 95.55%, so 
that only 35,608 options were exercisable and 1,658 options lapsed. Of the April 2005 grant, all of the options lapsed after three months, the exercise price not having 
been attained. Mr Kong’s entitlement under the LTIP remains.
Grants have been phased, so far as possible, over the ten-year life of each of the plans. Directors were eligible to exercise share options
during 2006.
On 29 December 2006, the closing market price of Intertek ordinary shares was 833.5p. The highest and lowest prices of the shares during the 
year were 861.5p and 614.5p respectively.

share capital of the Company or any of its subsidiaries. No changes in the above Directors’ interests have taken place between 31 December 
2006 and the date of this Report.
Approved by the Board on 5 March 2007.

Chairman, Remuneration Committee  31 Intertek Group plc Annual Report 31
The Group is committed to high standards of corporate governance 
and this report outlines the Company’s compliance with the provisions 
of the revised Combined Code on Corporate Governance issued by 
the Financial Reporting Council in June 2006 (the Code). During 2006, 
the Company complied with almost all the provisions of the Code. 
Any areas of non-compliance are described in this report. The Board 
is accountable to the Company’s shareholders for good corporate 
governance and this statement describes how the relevant principles 
of governance have been applied.
The Board
An effective Board, which provides entrepreneurial leadership and 
controls the Group, is in place. The Board’s main roles are to create 
value for shareholders, to lead the Group, to approve the Group’s 
strategic objectives and to ensure that the necessary ﬁ nancial and 
other resources are made available to enable it to meet those 
objectives. The Board is responsible to shareholders for the proper 
management of the Group. All Directors have a wide range of 
experience and skills, bringing independent judgement to bear on 
issues of strategy, performance, resources and standards of conduct. 
There were eight scheduled Board meetings held in 2006. There 
was, in addition, frequent contact between Directors to discuss the 
Company’s affairs and develop its business. Directors’ attendance 
at Board meetings is shown in the table on page 32. Also, on several 
occasions, the Chairman met with the Non-Executive Directors 
without the Executive Directors being present. 
Board matrix
The Group has identiﬁ ed a number of key areas that are subject 
to regular reporting to the Board, so that the performance of 
management can be reviewed and monitored. A Board matrix is in 
place which formally outlines the matters speciﬁ cally requiring the 
consent of the full Board and includes, inter alia, the approval of Group 
strategy and operating plans, the annual budget, the Annual Report, 
the Interim Report and related announcements, substantial capital 
expenditure, large acquisitions and disposals, the recommendation of 
dividends and the approval of treasury and risk management policies. 
The Board matrix also identiﬁ es areas where executive management 
can grant approval subject to certain ﬁ nancial limits. Where any of the 
activities involve amounts greater than those limits they are referred to 
the Board. The authorities in the Board matrix are reviewed regularly 
and any changes are approved by the Board. The Board matrix is 
communicated to all senior management to ensure that throughout 
the Group it is known when Board approval is required. 
Board management
During the year the Board consisted of the Chairman VE Treves, the 
Non-Executive Deputy Chairman RC Nelson, the Chief Executive 
Ofﬁ cer WG Hauser, the Chief Financial Ofﬁ cer W Spencer, R Kong, 
a Non-Executive Director, and three independent Non-Executive 
Directors, DP Allvey, who is also the Senior Independent Director, 
D Rade, appointed 1 January 2006 and CJ Knight, appointed 
30 March 2006. R Kong’s engagement as a Non-Executive Director 
commenced on 1 July 2006, changing his status from Executive 
Director, following his retirement as Chief Executive of the Consumer 
Goods division. The Senior Independent Director is readily available to 
shareholders if they have concerns that remain unresolved after 
contacting the Company through the usual channels of Chairman, Chief 
Executive Ofﬁ cer or Chief Financial Ofﬁ cer or where such contact is 
inappropriate. The Directors’ biographies appear on pages 18 and 19. 
If a Director has any concerns about the Company or a proposed 
action, then such concerns are recorded in the Board minutes as a 
matter of course. Insurance cover is in place in respect of legal action 
against the Directors.
There is a clear division of responsibilities between the Chairman and 
the Chief Executive Ofﬁ cer and they have been set out in writing and 
approved by the Board. On appointment to the Board in May 2002 
the Chairman met the independence criteria set out in the Code.
The responsibilities of VE Treves as Chairman include those contained 
in the supporting principle to paragraph A.2 of the Code, namely 
leadership of the Board, ensuring its effectiveness in all aspects of its 
role and setting its agenda; ensuring that the directors receive accurate, 
timely and clear information; ensuring effective communication with 
shareholders; facilitating the effective contribution to the Board of Non-
Executive Directors in particular; and ensuring constructive relationships 
between the Executive and Non-Executive Directors. The Chief 
Executive Ofﬁ cer has direct charge of the Group on a day-to-day basis 
and is accountable to the Board for the ﬁ nancial and operational 
performance of the Group.
DP Allvey, D Rade and CJ Knight are clearly independent Non-Executive 
Directors. Under the provisions of the Code, neither RC Nelson nor 
R Kong are considered to be independent in their positions as Non-
Executive Deputy Chairman and Non-Executive Director, respectively, 
because of their previous service as executives in the Group. However, 
during the year both RC Nelson and R Kong continued to bring valuable 
expertise to the Board through their extensive knowledge of the business.
The Non-Executive Directors have a particular responsibility to ensure 
that the strategies proposed by the Executive Directors are fully 
discussed and critically examined, not only in the best long-term 
interests of shareholders, but also to ensure that they take proper 
account of the interests of customers and employees. The Non-
Executive Directors are all experienced and inﬂ uential individuals and 
through their mix of skills and business experience they contribute 
signiﬁ cantly to the effective functioning of the Board and its 
committees, ensuring that matters are fully debated and that no 
one individual or group dominates the decision-making process.
D Rade and CJ Knight were appointed during the year, following a 
review of the Board’s composition, and after consulting with advisers 
as to suitable candidates. Despite these appointments, the Board, 
excluding the Chairman, does not comprise at least half “independent” 
Non-Executive Directors, as deﬁ ned and required by the Code. 
However, the Board believes that its current composition, taking into 
account the overall balance of skills, knowledge, commitment and 
experience, results in an efﬁ cient and effective board operation, 
whilst maintaining an appropriate balance between Executive and 
Non-Executive Directors.
To enable them to discharge their duties, all Directors have full and 
timely access to all relevant information. Papers are circulated well 
before the Board and Committee meetings to ensure that Directors 
have the necessary time to read and review them. The Non-Executive 
Directors receive monthly management accounts and regular 
management reports and information which enable them to scrutinise 
the Group’s and management’s performance against agreed 
objectives and prior performance.
A formal induction programme has been established for new 
Directors, tailored to suit the individual’s previous experience. 
Ongoing training is provided to Directors and visits to sites arranged. 
Directors are briefed on changes to legislation and best practice.
All Directors have access to the advice and services of the Company 
Secretary who will assist in arranging any additional training and 
information as required. The appointment and removal of the 
Company Secretary is a matter for the Board as a whole.
Corporate governance 32 Intertek Group plc Annual Report
Corporate governance
All Directors are entitled to obtain independent professional advice, at the Company’s expense, in the performance of their duties as Directors. 
No such advice was sought during the year.
The Board believes that strong corporate governance improves the performance of the business and enhances shareholder value. During its 
meetings in 2006, the Board received and discussed the Chief Executive Ofﬁ cer’s and Chief Financial Ofﬁ cer’s reports, market reports, share 
trading reports, analysts’ forecasts, potential acquisitions, claims and risk reports, ﬁ nal and interim dividend recommendations, potential 
contract bids, road show and investor feedback, alternative capital structures, divisional budgets, marketing initiatives, treasury policy, year 
end and interim reports and announcements, IT strategy and a wide range of other issues. 
Board Committees
The Board has established three Committees, each with clearly deﬁ ned terms of reference, procedures and powers. These terms of reference 
are available on request from the Company Secretary at the registered ofﬁ ce or can be downloaded from www.intertek.com. The number of 
full Board meetings and Committee meetings attended by each Director during the year was as follows:

Figures in brackets indicate the number of meetings held in the period during which the relevant individual was a Director or Committee member.
Membership of the three relevant Board Committees is set out below. 
The Remuneration Committee
This Committee currently comprises three Non-Executive Directors, DP Allvey (Chairman), VE Treves and CJ Knight. Following his appointment 
as a Non-Executive Director CJ Knight was appointed as a Committee member on 30 March 2006. The Code requires the Remuneration 
Committee to have at least three independent Non-Executive Directors. As Chairman of the Board of Directors of the Company, VE Treves is 
not viewed as independent by the Code so that, in this regard, there was non-compliance with it. During 2006 the Remuneration Committee 
was evaluated and the Board agreed that membership of the Committee was appropriate and effective and that VE Treves exercised 
independent judgement on all remuneration matters referred to and discussed by that Committee. The current Code also recommends that the 
Chairman of the Board of Directors is not a member of the Remuneration Committee. However, following a change to the Code which will be 
effective for years beginning after 1 November 2006, this recommendation has been dropped, provided that the Chairman is independent on 
appointment, which was the case for VE Treves, and accordingly this will not be an area of non-compliance for the Company next year. 
The Committee has responsibility for making recommendations to the Board on the remuneration of the Executive Directors and senior 
executives and for the determination, within agreed terms of reference, of additional beneﬁ ts for each of the Executive Directors, including 
pension rights and any compensation for loss of ofﬁ ce. The Committee is also responsible for the implementation and operation of employee 
share incentive arrangements. 
During 2006 the Remuneration Committee met ﬁ ve times. At those meetings the Committee discussed, amongst other things, policy with regard 
to salary increases on promotion, reviewed the ﬁ nancial status and investment strategy of the Company’s UK ﬁ nal salary pension scheme, 
determined bonus awards for 2005 and bonus targets for 2006, determined salary increases for senior members of the executive team, 
determined the mechanics of the Long Term Incentive Plan (2005 Deferred Bonus Plan), and approved the annual Remuneration Report.
Details of the Group’s remuneration for Executive Directors and details of beneﬁ ts, share options, pensions entitlements, service contracts and 
compensation payments are given in the Remuneration Report on pages 22 to 30.
The Nomination Committee
This Committee currently comprises three Non-Executive Directors, VE Treves (Chairman), DP Allvey and CJ Knight. Following his appointment as 
a Non-Executive Director CJ Knight was appointed as a Committee member on 30 March 2006, and from that date forward the Company was in 
full compliance with the relevant Code provisions, which require a Nomination Committee to have a majority of independent Non-Executive 
Directors. During 2006 this Committee was evaluated and the Board agreed that membership of the Committee was appropriate and effective. 
This Committee, which met twice during the year, nominates candidates to ﬁ ll Board vacancies, reviews succession planning and makes 
recommendations on the balance and composition of the Board. Bearing in mind the balance of existing skills, knowledge and experience on 
the Board, a job description is prepared for any new Board position and when a Non-Executive Director is appointed, the Committee requires 
conﬁ rmation that he or she can devote sufﬁ cient time to fulﬁ l the commitments of the role. The terms and conditions of appointment of Non-
Executive Directors are available for inspection by any person at the Company’s registered ofﬁ ce during normal business hours and at the Annual  33 Intertek Group plc Annual Report
General Meeting (for 15 minutes prior to the meeting and during the 
meeting). All new Directors are subject to election by shareholders at 
the ﬁ rst annual general meeting after their appointment and then are 
subject to re-election by shareholders once every three years. 
Following the sudden death of R Sayers in 2005, and the evaluation 
of numerous possible replacements, the Committee recommended 
and the Board appointed Christopher Knight as a Non-Executive 
Director with effect from 30 March 2006. 
The policy on Directors’ service contracts is set out in the 
Remuneration Report.
The Audit and Risk Committee
This Committee currently comprises three Non-Executive Directors, 
DP Allvey (Chairman), VE Treves and CJ Knight. CJ Knight was 
appointed as a Committee member on 30 March 2006. As Chairman 
of the Company, VE Treves is not viewed as independent by the 
Code, so that, in this regard, there was non-compliance with it. 
(The Code requires an Audit and Risk Committee to have at least three 
independent Non-Executive Directors.) During 2006, the Audit and 
Risk Committee was evaluated and the Board agreed that membership 
of the Committee was appropriate and effective and that VE Treves 
exercised independent judgement on all issues presented and 
discussed by that Committee. DP Allvey has recent and relevant 
ﬁ nancial experience as detailed in his biography on page 19.
The Audit and Risk Committee monitors the integrity of the Group’s 
ﬁ nancial statements and any formal announcements relating to the 
Group’s performance. The Committee is responsible for monitoring 
the effectiveness of the external audit process and making 
recommendations to the Board in relation to the appointment, re-
appointment and remuneration of the external auditors, and for 
ensuring that an appropriate relationship between the Group and 
the external auditors is maintained. It also reviews annually the 
Group’s systems of internal control, the processes for monitoring and 
evaluating the risks facing the Group and the effectiveness of the 
internal audit function. It is responsible for approving the appointment 
and termination of the Head of Internal Audit and meets with him at 
least once a year without management present.
The Group’s auditors, Chief Executive Ofﬁ cer, Chief Financial Ofﬁ cer, 
Vice President Financial Control, Vice President Compliance and the 
Head of Internal Audit, usually attend Committee meetings. The 
Group’s auditors meet with the members of the Audit and Risk 
Committee alone at least once a year.
The Audit and Risk Committee seeks to ensure the continued 
independence and objectivity of the Group’s auditors. A policy on 
the provision of non-audit work by the external auditor has been 
approved by the Board to ensure that auditor objectivity and 
independence are safeguarded. To this end, the policy highlights 
those areas where the external auditor cannot provide services to 
the Group, including inter alia, the provision of Group management 
functions, internal audit outsourcing, provision of legal advice and 
recruitment and remuneration advice. As a reassurance, the auditors 
conﬁ rm by way of letter to the Board that processes to ensure 
compliance with this policy are in place, and that these processes are 
monitored regularly. A detailed breakdown of the audit and non-audit 
fees paid to the Group’s auditors during the year is set out in note 4 
to the ﬁ nancial statements.
At its meetings during 2006 the Committee reviewed and endorsed, 
prior to submission to the Board, the Company’s Interim Report 
and Annual Report and results announcements. The Committee 
also monitored and reviewed the standards and effectiveness of 
risk management and internal control, the company’s internal 
audit function and its plans and performance. It also reviewed 
the Company’s arrangements for business continuity planning, 
IT systems and security, fraud and related matters, whistle blowing 
and hotlines, compliance and e-learning, and substantial claims 
affecting the Company.
The ultimate responsibility for reviewing and approving the Annual 
Report and the Interim Report remains with the Board. 
During 2006 the Audit and Risk Committee met four times. The 
Chairman and other Committee members also attend meetings held 
twice a year with the external auditor and management to discuss any 
accounting issues associated with the annual audit and interim review. 
Performance evaluation
A performance evaluation process led by the Chairman is applied to 
each Director, Committee and the Board as a whole. This comprises a 
series of questionnaires which provide a framework for the evaluation 
process, and provide the Chairman with a means of making year-on-
year comparisons. There are questionnaires for each of the following: 
the Board; each individual Director; the Remuneration, Nomination 
and Audit and Risk Committees. 
This annual evaluation of the effectiveness of the Board and its 
Committees ensures that the performance of each individual Director 
and the functioning and constitution of the Board and each 
Committee are properly measured. 
The Chairman assesses the individual performance of each Director, 
based on questionnaires from the other Directors. The Senior 
Independent Director has discussions with the other Executive and Non-
Executive Directors, without the Chairman being present, in order to 
appraise the Chairman’s performance during the year. For the year 
under review these assessments concluded that the performance of the 
Board and each Director was and is effective and that all Directors 
demonstrate full commitment in their respective roles to the Company 
(evidenced, inter alia, by the Board and Committee attendance records 
set out in this report). The evaluations further demonstrate that the 
Board has the right set of skills, that all the Directors add value to the 
overall effectiveness and success of the Group, and that no substantial 
issues have arisen out of the evaluation process. 
The Remuneration, Nomination, and Audit and Risk Committees each 
also held an evaluation of their work and effectiveness during the 
year, the results of which were reported to the Board by the respective 
Committee Chairmen. The reviews concluded that each Committee 
was operating in an efﬁ cient and effective manner. 
The Board will continue to develop the evaluation process in order to 
ensure that it can properly review, on an annual basis, its performance 
and that of its individual members and Committees.
Internal control
Many of Intertek’s primary business objectives relate to compliance 
to ensure adherence to local, national and international laws and 
requiring our employees to show integrity and honesty in all business 
dealings. Risk management and internal controls are therefore 
embedded in the running of each division, assuring the accuracy 
and validity of reports and certiﬁ cates that we provide to customers. 
Although the Directors are ultimately responsible for establishing and 
maintaining the Group’s system of internal control and for reviewing 
its effectiveness, such a system is designed to manage rather than 
eliminate the risk of failure to achieve business objectives and can only 
provide reasonable assurance against material misstatement or loss.
The Board can conﬁ rm that, in addition to internal audits, there is  34 Intertek Group plc Annual Report
Corporate governance
an ongoing process for identifying, evaluating and managing any 
signiﬁ cant risks to the Group’s short and long-term value, including 
those arising from social, environmental and ethical matters. This 
process has been in place for the year under review and up to the date 
of approval of the Annual Report, is regularly reviewed by the Board, 
and accords with the Turnbull Guidance. During the year, strong 
internal controls were found with a few exceptions which were the 
subject of immediate corrective action. No material breaches of any 
internal controls were identiﬁ ed during the year. In carrying out the 
risk review the Board is satisﬁ ed that it received adequate information 
from the operations around the world. Training is provided to 
Directors on these matters where necessary. 
The Audit and Risk Committee has reviewed the effectiveness of the 
system of ﬁ nancial and non-ﬁ nancial internal control during the year. 
In particular, it has reviewed and continues to seek to improve the 
process for identifying and evaluating the signiﬁ cant risks affecting 
the business and the policies and procedures by which these risks are 
managed. This is reinforced by the Code of Ethics, which provides 
practical guidance and instruction for staff. A copy of this Code is 
available at www.intertek.com. 
The Group operates a “zero tolerance policy” in regard to breaches of 
ethics and employees are required to sign a certiﬁ cate conﬁ rming their 
understanding that any breaches of the Group’s code of ethics will 
result in disciplinary action that may include dismissal of the employee 
concerned. To support Group policies and to facilitate the raising of 
concerns about possible improprieties in matters of ﬁ nancial reporting 
and other matters, there are independently managed email and 
telephone hotlines so that staff may report anonymously any 
inaccurate or unethical working practices. 
In carrying out its review, the Audit and Risk Committee endeavours 
to ensure that the Group has in place the most appropriate and 
effective controls, checks, systems and risk management techniques 
so as to be in line with best practice on such matters. 
Each operating division is responsible for the identiﬁ cation and 
evaluation of signiﬁ cant risks applicable to that area of business 
together with the design and operation of suitable internal controls. 
These risks are assessed on a continual basis and may be associated 
with a variety of internal or external sources including control 
breakdowns, disruption of information systems, competition, natural 
catastrophe and regulatory requirements. Operation of the controls 
is designed to minimise the occurrence of risk or of its consequences.
A process of control using self-assessment and hierarchical reporting 
has been established which provides a documented trail of 
accountability. These procedures are applied across Group operations 
and provide for continuing assurances to be given at increasingly 
higher levels of management and ﬁ nally, to the Board. This process is 
facilitated by Internal Audit which also provides assurance as to the 
operation and validity of the system of internal controls. Planned 
corrective actions are independently monitored for timely completion.
Each division reports annually to the Audit and Risk Committee via 
the Chief Financial Ofﬁ cer on its review of risks and how they are 
managed. Each year senior managers throughout the Group conﬁ rm 
the adequacy of their systems of internal controls, compliance with 
Group policies, local laws and regulations and report any control 
weaknesses identiﬁ ed in the past year. One of the Audit and Risk 
Committee’s main roles is to review, on behalf of the Board, the key 
risks inherent in the business and the system of controls necessary 
to ensure such risks are properly managed. 
The Chief Financial Ofﬁ cer heads a central compliance team, which 
co-ordinates the quality assurance function. Quality assurance audits 
are carried out by the divisions and the ﬁ ndings reported to divisional 
management and to compliance ofﬁ cers. Each division has at least 
one dedicated compliance ofﬁ cer who undertakes investigations of 
issues that arise either from quality assurance audits or by other 
means such as the employee hotline. Reports of signiﬁ cant ﬁ ndings 
are presented to the Audit and Risk Committee. Each geographic 
region has an internal auditor who is independent of the divisions. 
The main reporting sites are reviewed annually. The other sites are 
reviewed regularly on a schedule based on materiality and risk. 
Reports of signiﬁ cant ﬁ ndings are presented to the Audit and Risk 
Committee and it monitors and reviews the effectiveness of the 
internal audit function. The internal audit department was awarded 
ISO 9001:2000 accreditation in 2003 and was re-accredited in 2006.
The Group will, from time to time, be required by its customers to 
operate in countries where there is potential political and economic 
risk. In doing so, the Group maintains a policy of facilitating 
international trade inspection and audit services that help to prevent 
corruption and assist with humanitarian aid. Where there are no laws 
in place that prohibit business dealings in certain countries, the Group 
will consider operating in those countries, but only in strict accordance 
with its stringent Code of Ethics.
The Audit and Risk Committee reviews the assurance procedures, 
ensuring that an appropriate mix of techniques is used to attain the 
level of assurance required by the Board.
The Chief Executive Ofﬁ cer also reports to the Board on signiﬁ cant 
changes in the business and the external environment, which could 
impact on risk. The Chief Financial Ofﬁ cer provides the Board with 
monthly ﬁ nancial information, which includes the comparison of key 
performance ﬁ gures against budget and forecasts, risk indicators 
and compliance with covenants. Where areas for improvement in 
the system are identiﬁ ed, the Board considers the recommendations 
made by management and the Audit and Risk Committee. The Board 
approves the treasury policy and that department’s activities are also 
subject to internal audit.
Relations with shareholders
Communications with shareholders are given a high priority. The 
Company produces an Annual Report which is sent to shareholders. 
At the half year, an Interim Report is published. The Group also has a 
website www.intertek.com which contains up-to-date information on 
the Group’s activities and published ﬁ nancial results. Shareholders can 
subscribe via the Investor Relations section of www.intertek.com to 
receive email alerts of important announcements made by the Group.
Going concern
After making enquiries, the Directors have a reasonable expectation 
that the Group has adequate resources to continue in operation for 
the foreseeable future. Accordingly, they continue to adopt the going 
concern basis in preparing the Group’s ﬁ nancial statements.
Corporate responsibility 
The Board recognises that the Group has a responsibility to act 
ethically in relation to the physical and social environment in which 
it operates and that failure to do so could adversely impact on the 
Group’s long and short-term value, as a result of ﬁ nancial penalty and 
loss of customer support. It takes such responsibilities seriously, paying 
due regard to international and local laws in all its dealings. Further 
details are disclosed in the Corporate Responsibility statement on 
pages 35 to 36.  35 Intertek Group plc Annual Report
Corporate social responsibility
This Corporate Responsibility statement examines how, during the 
year under review, Intertek managed its own relationships with 
stakeholders including business partners, employees and local 
communities, and how the management of corporate responsibility 
issues ﬁ ts within the Group’s overall business aims. Speciﬁ c corporate 
governance issues are reported in the Corporate Governance Report 
on pages 31 to 34.
In this Annual Report are examples of the positive impact that 
Intertek’s business has had, through its services, on consumers and 
on the environment. It is the very nature of Intertek’s business to 
test, measure and analyse products, commodities and systems, 
contributing to a safer, healthier environment. The Group’s work with 
clients and their supply chains increases energy efﬁ ciency and reduces 
waste and risks from hazardous substances. Products are made safer 
and systems more reliable. 
Intertek’s business
Intertek is a service business and its commitment to supporting and 
adding value for its customers drives everything it does. The Group 
delivers innovative solutions to facilitate its customers’ success in the 
global marketplace and through its local service and global network 
Intertek enables its customers to dedicate their energies to their core 
business activities. The Group offers comprehensive programmes and 
services which draw on its industry-speciﬁ c knowledge and technical 
expertise and it provides its customers with conﬁ dence.
Intertek’s services are wide-ranging and produce diverse beneﬁ ts 
through its customers. Intertek provides Social Compliance 
Monitoring, which monitors manufacturers, including the carrying 
out of on-site audit, to help ensure that work practices and factory 
conditions are legal, humane and ethical, and that no enforced or 
child labour is used. Intertek tests fuels for purity and performance, 
measures air and noise emissions, reviews imports to assess 
their safety and quality, provides scanning services for security 
programmes, tests products for compliance with hazardous substance 
requirements and has been instrumental in developing the European 
Union’s product recall guide. These are some examples of the many 
ways Intertek’s services impact on a range of stakeholders.
The Group’s focus over the last year has been principally on “people 
issues”. The commitments Intertek has made in its mission statement 
include the delivery of outstanding results through sound ﬁ nancial 
practices, through stable growth and through supporting and adding 
value for its customers and these aims can only be achieved through 
the development of the technical and local expertise of Intertek staff, 
the provision of a robust structure in which to work and beneﬁ cial 
relationships with a variety of stakeholders. 
Intertek has adopted and published the following values for the 
Group and for the individuals who work for it, the Group will:
value trust and personal responsibility;
act with integrity, honesty and respect;
 value each employee’s contribution toward achieving our 
business objectives;
 promote a culture where motivated customer-orientated 
employees can ﬂ ourish, experience professional fulﬁ lment and 
reach their highest potential; and 
 respect diverse perspectives, experiences and traditions as essential.
These values feed into the Group’s relationships with staff, customers, 
suppliers and other stakeholders.

Corporate responsibility structure
The Chief Executive Ofﬁ cer is responsible for all the Group’s corporate 
responsibility policies and their overall implementation. Certain 
standards adopted by the Group, such as the requirement for each 
employee to commit to the Group’s Code of Ethics, have global 
application. In other cases, for example charitable giving, because 
of the geographically and socially diverse nature of the Group’s 
staff, Intertek has adopted a framework approach to enable local 
managers to tailor their relationships with employees, customers or 
local communities so that they are appropriate but always remaining 
within the Group’s value framework. As a result of Intertek’s 
decentralised management style, local managers have responsibility 
for the implementation of the Group’s corporate responsibility 
practices in their own area.
Intertek is a member of a number of institutions and associations 
that have as their aim the achievement of beneﬁ ts, both social and 
ﬁ nancial, through improvements in corporate citizenship practices. 
The Group’s participation in CSR Europe, the Ethos Institute of 
Business and Social Responsibility, Business of Social Responsibility and 
Canadian Business of Social Responsibility provides the opportunity to 
play a role in translating responsible business policies into practice. It is 
Intertek’s intention to pursue similar memberships in order to beneﬁ t 
from current thinking on best practice and to provide assurance to 
stakeholders in an easily accessible way that accepted benchmarks are 
met by the Group. 
The Ethical Sourcing Multi-Stakeholder forum that Intertek established 
in 2005 encourages dialogue between a range of stakeholders on 
important issues with respect to global supply chains and the Group 
actively leads and sponsors several working groups which connect 
leading stakeholders such as non-governmental organisations, 
companies, investors, federations and the media on the advancement 
of corporate responsibility in international business practices. 
The Group provides expert technical input to a number of national, 
regional and international standards development committees which 
contribute to ensuring that the safety, electro-magnetic compatibility 
and environmental requirements of products remain adequate in the 
changing environment, where new technologies and applications 
require constant review to maintain an acceptable level of safety and 
performance.
The Group is also involved in the development and management of 
recognised and globally accepted conformity assessment schemes 
which include assessment of production processes in addition to 
compliance to national or international standards. Intertek is an 
accepted leader in this regard.
Employees
Diversity
Intertek’s practice is to recruit local people and the Group considers 
the diversity of its staff one of its greatest assets, enabling 
it to act sensitively to the needs and cultures of its staff and to be 
open to different ways of doing business, in line with local practices 
and customs. As a result of the rapid growth of the Group (and of 
normal staff turnover), some one-ﬁ fth of current employees have 
been recruited in the last year. The Group is therefore developing its

access across the Group. In addition, on-line training in the application 
of the Group’s ethical values has recently been introduced to improve 
effectiveness and provide consistency of approach. The Group 
increasingly uses surveys as a gauge of employee sentiment on a 
number of issues.
Development
As outlined in the Group human resources framework policy, 
Intertek’s strategy for the development of its staff is: 
 to invest in the competence of employees and provide a 
stimulating work environment;
 to improve the Group’s capacity to attract, develop, and retain the 
best people who share in the mission, values and success of the 
Group; and
 to provide employees with the opportunity to make their best 
contribution both individually and in teams, for their personal 
satisfaction and the success of Intertek’s business and customers. 
In pursuance of this strategy each employee will be supported so 
that they may contribute their best in a role suited to their personal 
abilities, competence and preferences. Each employee should have a 
face-to-face discussion with their direct manager at least once every 
12 months. The Group provides continuous learning opportunities 
and training for personal growth so that employees remain up-to-date 
and highly expert in the services delivered to customers. The Group’s 
management development initiatives focus on leadership workshops 
to develop its existing teams as well as identifying and growing talent. 
Intertek has recently carried out a talent mapping review of senior 
management to ensure that its management team is the right one 
for the future.
Equality
The Group aims to ensure that all employees are assessed solely on 
the basis of their ability irrespective of their race, religion, colour, age, 
disabilities, gender or sexual orientation. 
In accordance with the Group’s equal opportunities policy, people with 
disabilities are given the same consideration as others when they apply 
for jobs. Depending on their skills and aptitudes, they enjoy the same 
career prospects as other employees. Where employees become 
disabled every effort will be made to retain them in their current role or 
to explore possibilities for retraining or redeployment within the Group. 
Where necessary the Group aims to provide such employees with 
facilities, equipment and training to assist them in doing their jobs. 
Health, safety and risk
The health and safety of the Group’s employees is a matter of primary 
concern. Accordingly, the Group manages its activities so as to avoid 
any unnecessary or unacceptable risks and local labour laws, best 
practice codes and regulations are applied. Intertek has employees 
and facilities in areas where there is a risk of disruption from natural 
disasters such as hurricanes, ﬂ oods and earthquakes. The Group has 
comprehensive disaster recovery plans which include securing the 
safety and wellbeing of employees. Following the hurricane Katrina 
and Rita in the US, Intertek beneﬁ tted from its support to employees 
by being among the ﬁ rst in its line of business to recommence 
operations.

Share plans
The Group is committed to encouraging its key executives to align 
themselves with the interests of shareholders and the Group’s 
performance, through the ownership of the Company’s shares. The 
Company operates share schemes for senior executives and details 
are contained in the Remuneration Report on pages 22 to 30.
Unions
Some of the Group’s employees are members of trade unions and 
work councils, mostly in continental Europe. The Group communicates 
regularly with the union representatives and aims to maintain good 
labour relations with all its employees. 
Business standards and ethics
The reliability of Intertek’s work is absolutely crucial to its continuing 
success. Trust in the employees who provide the Group’s services is 
underpinned by the Group’s Code of Ethics, which every employee 
must sign and on which each employee receives brieﬁ ng. The Code 
addresses matters of honesty and integrity, conﬂ icts of interest, 
conﬁ dentiality, the potential for bribery and violation of local or global 
laws or guidelines. It can be found in full on the Group’s website as 
can the Zero Tolerance policy which states that all reports issued by 
the Group must be accurate and no deviation from this standard is 
tolerated. A telephone hotline, which can be used in a number of 
languages, is provided to staff and also via the website to raise 
concerns about this or any other aspect of the Group’s operations. All 
instances are investigated by an appropriate person, who is likely to be 
a compliance ofﬁ cer, a member of the Internal Audit team or a human 
resources professional depending on the nature of the concern. The 
results are reported to Executive Directors fortnightly and to the Audit 
and Risk Committee on a regular basis. On average some 30–50 
reports per year are received by the Group through the hotline and 
other means with most concerns relating to workplace conduct. 
Regular Internal Audit reviews also include ethical compliance matters. 
The Internal Controls section of the Corporate Governance Report on 
pages 33 to 34 contains more details on the audit of controls.
Community involvement and charitable giving
The Group operates at a large number of sites in 109 countries. 
Intertek’s strategy is to allow local management to manage 
relationships with local communities and stakeholders in order to 
maximise local knowledge and beneﬁ t. The following examples 
demonstrate how this approach has worked during 2006.
In St John’s, Canada, where a great deal of emphasis is placed on 
environmental issues, Intertek has recently agreed to donate £9,500 
a year for the next ﬁ ve years to a new Environmental University Trust. 
Intertek’s principal ofﬁ ce in the People’s Republic of China encourages 
employees to volunteer for seaside cleaning operations and sponsors 
tree-planting. Some 100 employees and their families take part in the 
planting activity. Staff have also collected school materials for poor 
areas in China. The Group also contributes some £19,000 per year 
to a scholarship fund for HuaDong University. 
In the US, staff contribute time to promote the Ronald McDonald 
House charity and Intertek has sponsored events in connection with 
the same charity. The Houston client Christmas party supports a local 
charity each year and in 2006 it raised £1,000 cash and contributed 
300 toys for needy families in the Houston area. The Group’s Cortland 
site in New York state was involved in some twenty projects, some of 
a national nature and many local, raising amounts of up to £4,200. 
Other projects in the US included the donation of 350 Thanksgiving 
dinners and volunteering for river clean-up operations. 37 Intertek Group plc Annual Report
In South Africa, as part of the Black Economic Empowerment 
programme encouraged by the government, one quarter of the local 
company, Intertek Testing Services SA Pty Ltd, is owned by a trust 
which holds the shares on behalf of black employees. Procurement 
policies which assist black businesses have been adopted. In addition 
employees are encouraged to contribute time and expertise to 
programmes assisting underprivileged communities. These include 
donating food, clothing and equipment to an orphanage caring for 
AIDS orphans and donating computers to schools.
Environment
The Group’s impact on the environment through its services includes 
assisting its clients to meet compliance and effectiveness targets in 
the production of bio fuels and ethanol. Intertek assists compliance 
with ultra low sulphur diesel legislation affecting retail outlets and 
distribution channels and also contributes towards the production 
of low energy and low emission equipment.
As a service business, the Group’s own operations have limited direct 
impact on the environment. Many of the sites the Group occupies are 
not owned or managed by Intertek. However, Intertek recognises that 
its day-to-day activities do have an impact on the environment. The 
Group is committed to reducing any adverse impact on the environment 
as a result of its operations and to beneﬁ ting from reductions in 
operating costs. Since the Group’s ﬂ otation in 2002 a review of the 
more signiﬁ cant Group sites has been carried out through the Health, 
Safety and Environment (HSE) programme, with 12–15 sites being 
subjected to review each year. Any concerns arising have been 
of a minor and easily remedied nature. In addition, the Group has 
recently concluded the ﬁ rst stage of an HSE survey of all Intertek sites 
designed to assess how the operational sites managed by Intertek are 
implementing and auditing HSE policy and minimising their impact on 
the environment as part of their HSE management procedures. In order 
to increase the transparency, ease and comparability of reporting across 
the Group Intertek’s risk management team has identiﬁ ed a number of 
measures including energy and water consumption, use of fuel by 
Group vehicles, use of ozone-depleting substances and waste and by-
product production. 
In certain cases, the Group occupies facilities where contamination 
occurred prior to the Group’s use of the site. In each case the 
Group has implemented remedial works, on the advice of third 
party specialists, to minimise further damage to the environment. 
Environmental due diligence is carried out before the acquisition of 
any new sites. The disposal of product samples is audited to ensure 
compliance with HSE guidelines. 
Customers, suppliers and shareholders
As the Group’s mission statement sets out, the adding of value for 
its customers is a key aim and is embedded in its service offerings. 
One of Intertek’s most important commercial initiatives during the 
year has been the introduction of a more uniﬁ ed service structure 
to enable its customers, a number of whom are present in several 
geographical areas and deal with several of the Group’s divisions, to 
deal with Intertek on a one-stop shop basis. Our websites and other 
promotional and advertising materials contain extensive details of the 
Group’s services and other information about the Group. Many of 
Intertek’s customers have been given access to extensive databases 
containing information relevant to our services. 
Every email sent by the Group’s Oil, Chemical & Agri division includes 
a customer service feedback link. The results are reported to local 
management and the head of the division and any issues arising are 
followed up by area and branch managers. 
Intertek has formal quality management systems in place in most of its 
larger facilities. These are based on internationally recognised quality 
management standards including ISO 9001, ISO 9000 and ISO 17025 
and include complaint handling procedures, staff assessment and 
operational systems. Quality metrics are compiled both locally and 
globally, including performance monitoring statistics that report the 
accuracy, speed and reliability of testing carried out. In addition, 
meetings are held with customers during which they may visit the 
Group’s facilities and review everything from invoice accuracy to 
laboratory charts. These meetings are usually followed by a formal 
report and corrective action if any deﬁ ciencies are identiﬁ ed. Regular 
customer satisfaction surveys are carried out.
Intertek aims to develop relationships with suppliers that are based 
upon mutual trust. The Group is aware of the importance of prompt 
payment, especially to small businesses, and it undertakes to pay 
suppliers on time and according to agreed terms of trade. The Group 
has a wide range of suppliers and no individual supplier is of critical 
importance to the Group. 
There have been over 200 individual meetings with shareholders and 
investment managers during the year, two week-long roadshows in 
the UK and several overseas roadshows, regular analyst brieﬁ ngs and 
an “investor day” at which signiﬁ cant investors and analysts were able 
to view our activities at two UK sites. Intertek’s investor relations team 
is readily available to handle enquiries. Feedback on the Group’s 
investor programme has been positive and Intertek has good 
relationships with investors and their representatives. 38 Intertek Group plc Annual Report

For the year ended 31 December 2006 42 Intertek Group plc Annual Report
1 General
Intertek Group plc is a company incorporated in the UK.
The Group ﬁ nancial statements as at and for the year ended 
31 December 2006 consolidate those of the Company and its 
subsidiaries (together referred to as the Group) and equity account 
the Group’s interest in associates. The parent company ﬁ nancial 
statements present information about the Company as a separate 
entity and not about its Group.
The Group’s activities are the testing, inspection and certiﬁ cation of 
products and commodities against a wide range of safety, regulatory, 
quality and performance standards. Note 3 provides a segmental 
analysis of the Group’s performance.
2 Signiﬁ cant accounting policies
(a) Statement of compliance
The Group ﬁ nancial statements have been prepared and approved
by the Directors in accordance with International Financial Reporting 
Standards as adopted by the EU (‘Adopted IFRSs’). The Company has 
elected to prepare its parent company ﬁ nancial statements in 
accordance with UK GAAP, these are presented on pages 73 to 76.
(b) Basis of preparation
The accounting policies set out below have been applied consistently 
to all periods presented in these consolidated ﬁ nancial statements.
Judgements made by the Directors in the application of accounting 
policies that have a signiﬁ cant effect on the ﬁ nancial statements and 
estimates and which carry a risk of material adjustment in the next 
year are discussed in note (w) below.
Measurement convention
The ﬁ nancial statements are prepared on the historical cost basis 
except that derivative ﬁ nancial instruments are stated at fair value 
and non–current assets held for sale are stated at the lower of their 
carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell. 
Functional and presentation currency
These consolidated ﬁ nancial statements are presented in sterling, 
which is the Company’s functional currency. All information presented 
in sterling has been rounded to the nearest hundred thousand.
(c) Basis of consolidation
Subsidiaries
Subsidiaries are those entities controlled by the Group. Control exists 
when the Group has the power, directly or indirectly to govern the 
ﬁ nancial and operating policies of an entity so as to obtain beneﬁ ts 
from its activities. In assessing control, potential voting rights that 
presently are exercisable or convertible are taken into account. The 
ﬁ nancial statements of subsidiaries are included in the consolidated 
ﬁ nancial statements from the date that control commences until the 
date that control ceases.
Associates
Associates are those entities in which the Group has signiﬁ cant 
inﬂ uence, but not control, over the ﬁ nancial and operating policies. 
The consolidated ﬁ nancial statements include the Group’s share of 
the total recognised income and expense of associates on an equity 
accounted basis, after adjustments to align the accounting policies 
with those of the Group, from the date that signiﬁ cant inﬂ uence 
commences until the date that signiﬁ cant inﬂ uence ceases. When
the Group’s share of losses exceeds its interest in an associate, the 
Group’s carrying amount is reduced to nil and recognition of further 
losses is discontinued except to the extent that the Group has 
incurred legal or constructive obligations or made payments on behalf 
of an associate. The Group does not consider the associate to be an 
integral part of the Group’s operations and therefore its results are 
presented outside of the Group operating proﬁ t.
Transactions eliminated on consolidation
Intra group balances and transactions, and any unrealised gains and 
losses or income and expenses arising from intra group transactions, 
are eliminated in preparing the consolidated ﬁ nancial statements. 
Unrealised gains arising from transactions with associates are 
eliminated against the investment to the extent of the Group’s 
interest in the entity. Unrealised losses are eliminated in the same 
way as unrealised gains, but only to the extent that there is no 
evidence of impairment.
(d) Foreign currency 
Foreign currency transactions
Transactions in foreign currencies are translated at the foreign 
exchange rate ruling at the date of the transaction. Monetary assets 
and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at the balance sheet 
date are translated at the foreign exchange rate ruling at that date. 
Foreign exchange differences arising on translation are recognised in 
the income statement except those arising on the retranslation of a 
ﬁ nancial liability designated as a hedge of net investment in a foreign 
operation. Non-monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign 
currencies that are stated at fair value are translated at foreign 
exchange rates ruling at the dates the fair values were determined.
Financial statements of foreign operations
The assets and liabilities of foreign operations, including goodwill
and fair value adjustments arising on consolidation, are translated to 
sterling at foreign exchange rates ruling at the balance sheet date. 
The revenues and expenses of foreign operations are translated 
into sterling at cumulative average rates of exchange during the year. 
Foreign exchange differences arising on translation are recognised 
directly in equity in a translation reserve.
Exchange differences arising from the translation of foreign operations, 
and of related qualifying hedges are taken directly to the translation 
reserve. They are released into the income statement upon disposal. 
The Group has taken advantage of relief available in IFRS 1, to deem 
the cumulative translation differences for all foreign operations to be 
zero at the date of transition to IFRS on 1 January 2004.
The most signiﬁ cant currencies for the Group were translated at the 
following exchange rate:

  Actual rates Cumulative average  
Value of £1  rates

Chinese renminbi 15.3 13.9 14.7 14.9
Euro 1.49 1.45 1.47 1.46
(e) Classiﬁ cation of ﬁ nancial instruments issued by the Group
Following the adoption of IAS 32, ﬁ nancial instruments issued by the 
Group are treated as equity (i.e. forming part of shareholders’ funds) 
only to the extent that they meet the following two conditions:
a) they include no contractual obligations upon the Company to 
deliver cash or other ﬁ nancial assets or to exchange ﬁ nancial assets 
or ﬁ nancial liabilities with another party under conditions that are 
potentially unfavourable to the Group; and
Notes to the ﬁ nancial statements 43 Intertek Group plc Annual Report
2 Signiﬁ cant accounting policies continued
b) where the instrument will or may be settled in the Company’s own 
equity instruments, it is either a non-derivative that includes no 
obligation to deliver a variable number of the Company’s own 
equity instruments or is a derivative that will be settled by the 
Company’s exchanging a ﬁ xed amount of cash or other ﬁ nancial 
assets for a ﬁ xed number of its own equity instruments.
To the extent that this deﬁ nition is not met, the proceeds of issue are 
classiﬁ ed as a ﬁ nancial liability. Where the instrument so classiﬁ ed 
takes the legal form of the Company’s own shares, the amounts 
presented in these ﬁ nancial statements for called up share capital and 
share premium account exclude amounts in relation to those shares.
Finance payments associated with ﬁ nancial liabilities are dealt with as 
part of ﬁ nance expenses. Finance payments associated with ﬁ nancial 
instruments that are classiﬁ ed in equity are dividends and are 
recorded directly in equity.
(f) Derivative ﬁ nancial instruments
The Group uses derivative ﬁ nancial instruments to economically 
hedge its exposure to foreign exchange and interest rate risks arising 
from operational, ﬁ nancing and investment activities. In accordance 
with its treasury policy, the Group does not hold or issue derivative 
ﬁ nancial instruments for trading purposes.
Derivative ﬁ nancial instruments are recognised initially at fair value. 
Subsequent to initial recognition, derivative ﬁ nancial instruments are 
stated at fair value. The gain or loss on re-measurement to fair value 
is recognised immediately in the income statement except where 
derivatives qualify for hedge accounting, in which case the recognition 
of any resultant gain or loss depends on the nature of the item being 
hedged (see accounting policy (g)). Derivatives that do not qualify for 
hedge accounting are accounted for as trading instruments.
The fair value of interest rate swaps is the estimated amount that the 
Group would receive or pay to terminate the swap at the balance 
sheet date, taking into account current interest rates and the current 
creditworthiness of the swap counterparties. The fair value of forward 
exchange contracts is their quoted market price at the balance sheet 
date, being the present value of the difference between the quoted 
forward price and the exercise price of the contract. 
(g) Hedging
Cash ﬂ ow hedges
Where a derivative ﬁ nancial instrument is designated as a hedge
of the variability in cash ﬂ ows of a recognised asset or liability, or a 
highly probable forecasted transaction, the effective part of any gain 
or loss on the derivative ﬁ nancial instrument is recognised directly in 
the hedging reserve. The ineffective part of any gain or loss on the 
derivative ﬁ nancial instrument is recognised in the income statement.
When a hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated or exercised, 
or the entity revokes designation of the hedge relationship but the 
hedged transaction is still expected to occur, the cumulative gain or loss 
at that point remains in equity and is recognised in accordance with the 
above policy when the transaction occurs. If the hedged transaction is 
no longer expected to take place, the cumulative unrealised gain or loss 
recognised in equity is recognised in the income statement immediately.
When the hedged item is a non-ﬁ nancial asset, the amount 
recognised in equity is transferred to the income statement in the 
same period that the hedged item affects the income statement.
Hedge of monetary assets and liabilities
Where a derivative ﬁ nancial instrument is used economically to hedge 
the foreign exchange exposure of a recognised monetary asset or 
liability, no hedge accounting is applied and any gain or loss on the 
hedging instrument is recognised in the income statement.
Hedge of net investment in a foreign operation
The portion of the gain or loss on an instrument used to hedge a 
net investment in a foreign operation that is determined to be an 
effective hedge is recognised directly in equity in a translation reserve. 
The ineffective portion is recognised immediately in the income 
statement. When the hedged net investment is disposed of, the 
cumulative amount in equity is transferred to the income statement 
as an adjustment to the proﬁ t or loss on disposal.
(h) Property, plant and equipment
Owned assets
Items of property, plant and equipment are stated at cost or deemed 
cost less accumulated depreciation (see below) and impairment losses 
(see accounting policy (m)).
Leased assets
Leases in terms of which the Group assumes substantially all the risks 
and rewards of ownership are classiﬁ ed as ﬁ nance leases. Where land 
and buildings are held under ﬁ nance leases, the accounting treatment 
of the land is considered separately from that of the buildings. Leased 
assets acquired by way of ﬁ nance leases are stated at an amount 
equal to the lower of their fair value and the present value of the 
minimum lease payments at inception of the lease, less accumulated 
depreciation and impairment losses. 
Other leases are operating leases. These leased assets are not 
recognised on the Group’s balance sheet.
Depreciation
Depreciation is charged to the income statement on a straight-line 
basis over the estimated useful lives of items of property, plant and 
equipment. Land is not depreciated. The estimated useful lives 
are as follows:
Freehold buildings and long leasehold land and buildings 50 years
Short leasehold land and buildings Term of lease 
Plant and equipment 3–10 years
Depreciation methods, residual values and the useful lives of all assets 
are re-assessed annually.
(i) Intangible assets
Goodwill
All business combinations are accounted for by applying the purchase 
method. Goodwill represents the difference between the cost of 
acquisition and the Group’s interest in the fair value of the identiﬁ able 
assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities acquired. Goodwill is stated 
at cost less any accumulated impairment losses (see accounting policy 
(m)). Goodwill is allocated to cash generating units (CGUs) and is not 
amortised but is tested annually for impairment. In respect of 
associates, the carrying amount of goodwill is included in the carrying 
amount of the investment in associate.
The Group has taken advantage of the exemption permitted by IFRS 1 
and has not restated goodwill on acquisitions prior to 1 January 2004, 
the date of transition to IFRS. 44 Intertek Group plc Annual Report
2 Signiﬁ cant accounting policies continued
Purchased goodwill in respect of acquisitions before 1 January 1998 
was written off to reserves in the year of acquisition, in accordance 
with the accounting standard then in force. 
Negative goodwill arising on an acquisition is recognised in the 
income statement.
Fair value adjustments are made in respect of acquisitions. If at the 
balance sheet date the fair values of the acquiree’s identiﬁ able assets, 
liabilities and contingent liabilities can only be established provisionally 
then these values are used. Any adjustments to these values made 
within 12 months of the acquisition date are taken as adjustments 
to goodwill. 
Other intangible assets
Intangible assets, other than goodwill, that are acquired by the
Group and computer software are stated at cost less accumulated 
amortisation and impairment losses. Identiﬁ able intangibles are
those which can be sold separately or which arise from legal rights 
regardless of whether those rights are separable.
Amortisation is charged to the income statement on a straight-line 
basis over the estimated useful lives. The estimated useful lives 
are as follows:
Computer software Up to 5 years
Customer relationships Up to 10 years
Know how Up to 5 years
Licenses Contractual life
Covenants not to compete Contractual life
(j) Trade and other receivables
Trade and other receivables are stated at their cost less impairment 
losses (see accounting policy (m)).
(k) Inventories
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value. 
The cost of the inventories is based on the LIFO principle. Cost 
comprises expenditure incurred in the normal course of business in 
bringing inventories to their present condition and location and net 
realisable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course 
of business, less the estimated selling costs.
(l) Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash balances and call deposits. 
Bank overdrafts that are repayable on demand and form an integral 
part of the Group’s cash management are included as a component 
of cash and cash equivalents for the purpose of the statement of 
cash ﬂ ows.
(m) Impairment
The carrying amount of the Group’s assets other than inventories, 
ﬁ nancial assets within the scope of IAS 39 and deferred tax assets, 
are reviewed at each balance sheet date to determine whether there 
is any indication of impairment. If any such indication exists, the 
asset’s recoverable amount is estimated. For goodwill and assets that 
have an indeﬁ nite useful life, the recoverable amount is estimated at 
each balance sheet date.
An impairment loss is recognised whenever the carrying amount of 
an asset or its cash generating unit exceeds its recoverable amount. 
Impairment losses are recognised in the income statement.
Impairment losses recognised in respect of cash generating units 
are allocated ﬁ rst to reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill 
allocated to cash generating units and then to reduce the carrying 
amount of the other assets in the unit on a pro-rata basis. A cash 
generating unit is the smallest identiﬁ able group of assets that 
generates cash inﬂ ows that are largely independent of the cash 
inﬂ ows from other assets or groups of assets.
Calculation of recoverable amount
The recoverable amount is the greater of the asset’s fair value less 
costs to sell and value in use. In assessing value in use, the estimated 
future cash ﬂ ows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax 
discount rate that reﬂ ects current market assessments of the time 
value of money and the risks speciﬁ c to the asset. For an asset that 
does not generate largely independent cash inﬂ ows, the recoverable 
amount is determined for the cash generating unit to which the asset 
belongs. Receivables with a short duration are not discounted.
Reversal of impairment
An impairment loss is reversed only to the extent that the asset’s 
carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would 
have been determined, net of depreciation or amortisation, if no 
impairment loss had been recognised. An impairment loss in respect 
of goodwill is not reversed. In respect of other assets, an impairment 
loss is reversed when there is an indication that the impairment loss 
may no longer exist as a result of a change in the estimates used to 
determine the recoverable amount including a change in fair value 
less cost to sell.
(n) Dividends
Dividends are reported as a movement in equity in the period 
in which they are approved by the shareholders.
(o) Interest-bearing borrowings
Interest-bearing borrowings are initially recognised at fair value,
less attributable transaction costs. Subsequent to initial recognition, 
interest-bearing borrowings are stated at amortised cost with any 
difference between cost and redemption value being recognised
in the income statement over the period of the borrowings on an 
effective interest basis.
(p) Employee beneﬁ ts
Deﬁ ned contribution plan
Obligations for contributions to deﬁ ned contribution pension plans 
are recognised as an expense in the income statement as incurred.
Deﬁ ned beneﬁ t plans
The net liability recognised in the balance sheet in respect of deﬁ ned 
beneﬁ t pension plans is the present value of the deﬁ ned beneﬁ t 
obligations at the balance sheet date less the fair value of the plan 
assets and less any unrecognised past service costs. Any net asset is 
subject to a ceiling test. The discount rate used to calculate the 
present value of the obligations is the yield at balance sheet date on 
high quality corporate bonds that have maturity dates approximating 
to the terms of the Group’s obligations. An independent ‘IAS 19’ 
actuarial valuation, using the projected unit credit method, is carried 
out at each balance sheet date. 
The increase in the present value of the liabilities expected to arise 
from the employees’ services in the accounting period is charged to 
the operating proﬁ t in the income statement. The expected return
on the schemes’ assets and the interest on the present value of the 
schemes’ liabilities during the accounting period are shown as ﬁ nance 
income and ﬁ nance expense respectively. Actuarial gains and losses 
are recognised immediately in equity. 
Notes to the ﬁ nancial statements 45 Intertek Group plc Annual Report
2 Signiﬁ cant accounting policies continued
Share based payment transactions
The share based compensation plans operated by the Group allow 
employees to acquire shares of the Company. The fair value of the 
employee services received in exchange for the grant of share options 
or shares is measured at the grant date and is recognised as an 
expense with a corresponding increase in equity. The charge is 
calculated using the Black Scholes method and expensed to the 
income statement over the vesting period of the relevant award.
The charge is adjusted to reﬂ ect expected and actual levels of vesting 
where conditions are non-market based. The expense of the share 
awards under the deferred bonus plan is adjusted for the probability 
of performance conditions being achieved. The Group has taken 
advantage of the provisions of IFRS 1: First-time Adoption of 
International Financial Reporting Standards, and has recognised an 
expense only in respect of share options and share awards granted 
since 7 November 2002.
Own shares held by ESOT trust
Transactions of the Group sponsored ESOT trust are included in the 
Group ﬁ nancial statements. In particular, the trust’s purchase of 
shares in the Company are debited directly to equity.
(q) Provisions
A provision is recognised in the balance sheet when the Group has a 
present legal or constructive obligation as a result of a past event and 
it is probable that an outﬂ ow of economic beneﬁ ts will be required to 
settle the obligation.
(r) Trade and other payables
Trade and other payables are stated at their cost.
(s) Revenue
Revenue represents the total amount receivable for services rendered, 
excluding sales related taxes and intra group transactions. Revenue 
from services rendered is recognised in the income statement when 
the relevant service is completed or in certain circumstances, in 
proportion to the stage of completion, normally determined by 
reference to costs incurred to date in proportion to the total 
anticipated costs of the transaction at the balance sheet date. 
(t) Expenses
Operating lease payments
Payments made under operating leases are recognised in the income 
statement on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease. Lease 
incentives received are recognised in the income statement as an 
integral part of the total lease expense.
Net ﬁ nancing costs
Net ﬁ nancing costs comprise interest payable on borrowings 
calculated using the effective interest rate method, amortisation of 
debt issuance costs, facility fees, interest receivable on funds invested, 
foreign exchange gains or losses on external interest, income and 
expense relating to pension assets and liabilities and gains and losses 
on hedging instruments that are recognised in the income statement 
(see accounting policy (g)). Interest income is recognised in the 
income statement as it accrues using the effective interest rate 
method. The interest expense component of ﬁ nance lease payments 
is recognised in the income statement using the effective interest rate 
method.
(u) Income tax 
Income tax on the proﬁ t or loss for the year comprises current and 
deferred tax. Income tax is recognised in the income statement except 
to the extent that it relates to items recognised directly to equity, in 
which case it is recognised in equity. 
Current tax is the expected tax payable on the taxable income for 
the year, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the 
balance sheet date, and any adjustment to tax payable in respect 
of previous years.
Deferred tax is provided using the balance sheet liability method, 
providing for temporary differences between the carrying amount of 
assets and liabilities for ﬁ nancial reporting purposes and the amounts 
used for taxation purposes. The following temporary differences are 
not provided for: initial recognition of goodwill, the initial recognition 
of assets or liabilities that affect neither accounting nor taxable proﬁ t, 
overseas retained earnings the distribution of which is under the 
control of the Group and which are not likely to be distributed in the 
foreseeable future, and differences relating to investments in 
subsidiaries to the extent that they will probably not reverse in the 
foreseeable future. The amount of deferred tax provided is based on 
the expected manner of realisation or settlement of the carrying 
amount of assets and liabilities, using tax rates enacted or 
substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
A deferred tax asset is recognised only to the extent that it is probable 
that future taxable proﬁ ts will be available against which the asset 
can be utilised. Deferred tax assets are reduced to the extent that
it is no longer probable that the related tax beneﬁ t will be realised.
Any additional income taxes that arise from the distribution of 
dividends are recognised at the same time as the liability to pay
the related dividend.
(v) Segment reporting
A segment is a distinguishable component of the Group that is 
engaged either in providing services (business segment) or in 
providing services within a particular economic environment 
(geographic segment), which is subject to risks and rewards
that are different from those of other segments.
(w) Signiﬁ cant accounting judgments and estimates
Judgments
In applying the Group’s accounting policies described above, the 
management has made the following judgments that have a signiﬁ cant 
impact on the amounts recognised in the ﬁ nancial statements.
Claims
Note 17 sets out the provisions made in respect of claims at 
31 December 2006 and note 27 explains contingent liabilities in 
respect of certain litigation. In making provision for claims, the 
management bases its judgment on the circumstances relating to 
each speciﬁ c event, internal and external legal advice, knowledge 
of the industries and markets, prevailing commercial terms and legal 
precedents. The Group’s legal and warranty claims are reviewed, at 
a minimum, on a quarterly basis by senior management. 46 Intertek Group plc Annual Report
2 Signiﬁ cant accounting policies continued
Estimates
The key assumptions concerning the future, and other key sources 
of estimation at the balance sheet date that have a risk of causing a 
material adjustment to the carrying amount of assets and liabilities 
within the next ﬁ nancial year, are discussed below.
Intangible assets
When the Group makes an acquisition, management review the 
business and assets acquired to determine whether any intangible 
assets should be recognised separately from goodwill. If such an asset 
is identiﬁ ed, then it is valued by discounting the probable future cash 
ﬂ ows expected to be generated by the asset, over the estimated life 
of the asset. Where there is uncertainty over the amount of economic 
beneﬁ t and the useful life this is factored into the calculation. Details 
of intangible assets are given in note 10.
 
Impairment of goodwill 
The Group determines whether goodwill is impaired at a minimum on 
an annual basis. This requires an estimation of the value in use of the 
cash generating units to which the goodwill is allocated. Estimating 
the value in use requires the Group to make an estimate of the 
expected future cash ﬂ ows from the cash generating unit that holds 
the goodwill at a determined discount rate to calculate the present 
value of those cash ﬂ ows. Note 10 sets out details of the testing of 
impairment at the balance sheet date. 
Recoverability of trade receivables
Trade receivables are reﬂ ected net of an estimated provision for 
doubtful accounts. This provision is based primarily on a review of all 
outstanding accounts and considers the past payment history and 
creditworthiness of each account and the length of time that the debt 
has remained unpaid. The actual amounts of debts that ultimately 
prove irrecoverable could vary from the actual provision made. 
Employee post retirement beneﬁ t obligations
The Group has two principal deﬁ ned pension beneﬁ t plans. The 
obligations under these plans are recognised in the balance sheet
and represent the present value of the obligation calculated by 
independent actuaries, with input from management. These actuarial 
valuations include assumptions such as discount rates, return on 
assets, salary progression and mortality rates. These assumptions
vary from time to time according to prevailing economic and social 
conditions. Details of the assumptions used and sensitivity analysis in 
relation to the mortality and discount rate assumptions are provided 
in note 22. 
Deferred tax
Deferred tax assets and liabilities require management judgement in 
determining the amounts to be recognised. In particular, judgement is 
used when assessing the extent to which deferred tax assets should 
be recognised with consideration given to the timing and level of 
future taxable income.
Income tax
The actual tax on our proﬁ ts is determined according to complex tax 
laws and regulations. Where the effect of these laws and regulations 
is unclear, estimates are used in determining the liability for the tax
to be paid on past proﬁ ts which are recognised in the ﬁ nancial 
statements. The Group considers the estimates, assumptions and 
judgements to be reasonable but this can involve complex issues 
which may take a number of years to resolve. The ﬁ nal determinaton 
of prior year tax liabilities could be different from the estimates 
reﬂ ected in the ﬁ nancial statements.
(x) Adopted IFRSs not yet applied
The following Adopted IFRSs were available for early application but 
have not been applied by the Group in these ﬁ nancial statements:
IFRS 7: Financial Instruments: Disclosures
Amendments to IAS 1: Presentation of Financial Statements: 
Capital Disclosures
Amendment to IAS 21: The Effects of Changes in Foreign 
Exchange Rates-Net Investment in a Foreign Operation
IFRIC 8: Scope of IFRS 2: Share-based Payment
IFRIC 9: Reassessment of Embedded Derivatives
The Directors anticipate that the adoption of these Standards and 
Interpretations in future periods will not have a material impact on 
the ﬁ nancial statements of the Group.
3 Segment reporting
Segment information is presented in respect of the Group’s business 
and geographical segments. The primary format, business segments, 
is based on the Group’s management and internal reporting structure.
Segment results, assets and liabilities include items directly 
attributable to a segment as well as those that can be allocated on
a reasonable basis. Unallocated items comprise mainly borrowings, 
pension fund liabilities, and corporate expenses and assets. 
Business segments
The Group comprises the following main business segments:
Consumer Goods (Labtest), which provides services to the textiles, 
footwear, toys, food and hardlines industries. 
Commercial & Electrical (ETL SEMKO), which provides testing, 
inspection and certiﬁ cation services to industries including those in 
the home appliances, medical, building, industrial and HVAC/R, IT
and telecom and automotive sectors. 
Oil, Chemical & Agri (Caleb Brett), which provides cargo inspection, 
testing and analytical services to the oil and gas, chemical, 
agricultural, mineral and pharmaceutical sectors.
Government Services (FTS), which provides trade services to standards 
bodies and governments. 
Central overheads comprise the costs of the corporate head ofﬁ ce 
and non-operating holding companies and other costs which are not 
controlled by the operating divisions. 
On 1 January 2006, the systems certiﬁ cation business was transferred 
from Consumer Goods to Commercial & Electrical and prior year 
ﬁ gures have been restated to show a like-for-like comparison. 
Geographical segments
All the business segments are managed on a worldwide basis but
can be divided into the following geographic regions:
Americas
Europe, Middle East and Africa 
Asia 
In presenting information on the basis of geographic segments, 
segment revenue is based on the geographical location of the entity 
that generated that revenue. Segment assets are based on the 
geographical location of the assets.

During the year there was a current tax charge of £1.3m on share options and foreign exchange differences (2005: credit of £0.8m) and 
deferred tax charge of £0.6m on pension deﬁ cit and share options (2005: credit of £0.6m) charged directly to equity (see notes 12 and 19).
 
The tax rate was 24.6% (2005: 23.6%). The main reason for the increase in the tax rate was due to an increase in earnings in higher taxed 
jurisdictions. The tax rate is expected to be sustainable at close to current year levels for the short to medium term. 50 Intertek Group plc Annual Report
8 Earnings per ordinary share
The calculation of earnings per ordinary share is based on proﬁ t attributable to equity holders of the Company and the weighted average 
number of ordinary shares in issue during the year. In addition to the earnings per share required by IAS 33: Earnings Per Share, an adjusted 
earnings per share has also been calculated and is based on earnings excluding the effect of amortisation of business combination intangibles 
and goodwill impairment. It has been calculated to allow shareholders a better understanding of the trading performance of the Group. 
Details of the adjusted earnings per share are set out below:

Total goodwill of £71.1m (2005: £55.7m) is attributable to 50 (2005: 43) acquired businesses which are grouped into 39 (2005: 33) cash 
generating units. Each of these cash generating units has been tested for impairment in accordance with the Group’s accounting policy 
described on page 44. 
Detailed results of the impairment tests for material acquisitions with goodwill in excess of 10% of total goodwill are presented below.

Other (each less than 10% of total goodwill)        43.0 35.9
Total goodwill net book value at 31 December       71.1 55.7
The goodwill for Entela is denominated in US dollars and the decrease in value of goodwill from £9.6m to £8.8m is due to foreign currency 
translation. The goodwill for Automotive Research is denominated in US dollars and the decrease in value of goodwill from £10.2m to £9.1m
is due to foreign currency translation.
Each of the acquisitions offers similar services to those already offered by the Intertek Group’s existing businesses, therefore it is considered 
appropriate to use the same assumptions in each of the impairment calculations. In each case the recoverable amount of the acquired business 
determined upon the value-in-use calculation, was higher than its carrying amount.
Management approved forecasts for each cash generating unit are used in these calculations. These forecasts cover a two year period and are 
based on the most current information relating to each business unit. Beyond two years, management consider that it is difﬁ cult to accurately 
forecast business growth for each individual unit. In Intertek’s business, most contractual relationships with customers are short term. Despite 
this, the Group has a strong historical track record of growth. Intertek is supporting global trade which grows faster than GDP and our 
underlying markets are expected to continue to show good growth. Therefore, when looking at longer term growth, a steady growth rate of 
5% is used for all business units. This is considered to be a reasonable assumption based on the long term historical growth rate in proﬁ ts of 
the Intertek business, and the post acquisition performance of businesses acquired.
A pre-tax discount rate of 12% has been used in these calculations. The characteristics of the businesses acquired are that they are not capital 
intensive and are largely similar to each other and the Group, and therefore the pre-tax discount rate of 12% which is based on the Group’s 
cost of capital, is considered the most appropriate rate.
The key sensitivity for the impairment test is the growth in operating proﬁ t. Had the overall growth rate been reduced by 1% to 4%, the 
carrying amount would still not have exceeded the recoverable amount. 54 Intertek Group plc Annual Report
10 Goodwill and other intangible assets continued
An increase of 1% in the discount rate assumption would not change the conclusions of the impairment tests.
There are 36 (2005: 31) cash generating units with a goodwill amount that is not signiﬁ cant in relation to the carrying value of goodwill of 
£71.1m (2005: £55.7m). The aggregate balance of goodwill for these multiple cash generating units is £43.0 (2005: £35.8m). The recoverable 
amount of all these units was determined following the same assumptions as for the individually signiﬁ cant units disclosed above.
An impairment charge of £0.3m was recognised within administrative expenses in the Oil, Chemical & Agri division in respect of the goodwill 
of Eurolabo, a company registered in Estonia and acquired by the Group in 2005. This was necessitated by lower than expected trading results 
in the period since acquisition. The goodwill impairment was based on a calculation of the recoverable amount based on value-in-use, using 
projected cash ﬂ ows for this company, discounted by a pre-tax rate of 12%. The charge of £0.3m represented the shortfall of the recoverable 
amount to the carrying value which, after the impairment, was £0.1m. 
No other goodwill impairment losses were identiﬁ ed.
In 2005, an impairment charge of £2.0m was recognised within administrative expenses in the Consumer Goods division, in respect of the 
goodwill of Fastech, a company acquired by the Group in 2003. This was necessitated by lower than expected trading results in the period 
since acquisition. The goodwill impairment was based on a calculation of the recoverable amount based on value-in-use, using projected cash 
ﬂ ows for this company, discounted by a pre-tax rate of 12%. The charge of £2.0m represented the shortfall of the recoverable amount to the 
carrying value which, after the impairment, was £3.3m. 
There are no intangible assets with indeﬁ nite lives.

Total        31.5 37.2
Deferred tax assets have not been recognised in respect of these items because it is not probable that future taxable proﬁ ts will be available 
against which the Group can utilise the beneﬁ ts from them.
There is a temporary difference of £16.4m (2005: £11.4m) which relates to unremitted post acquisition overseas earnings. No deferred tax is 
provided for on this amount as the distribution of these retained earnings is under the control of the Group and there is no intention to either 
repatriate from or sell the associated subsidiaries in the foreseeable future.

There is no material difference between the above amounts for trade and other receivables and their fair value, due to their short term

Description of borrowings
In December 2004, the Group reﬁ nanced its existing £300.0m secured facility with a £300.0m non-secured facility. The facility was for ﬁ ve 
years expiring on 15 December 2009, with the option to extend this for a further two years. The facility was extended by a year in 2005 and
by a further year in 2006. The facility now expires in December 2011.
The facility comprises three tranches. Facility A is a £42.0m multi-currency term loan (original £70.0m less repayments to 31 December 2006) 
with bi-annual amortisations over the remaining three years. Facility B is a £150.0m multi-currency revolving credit facility, available up to 
15 December 2011. Facility C is a 364 day, £80.0m multi-currency revolving credit facility, with the option to convert this into a one year loan 
by the end of the 364 day period.
Advances under Facilities A and B bear interest at a rate equal to LIBOR (as adjusted) plus a margin. The margin over LIBOR is in the range of 
0.4% to 0.6% in accordance with a leverage grid. As at 31 December 2006, the margin was 0.45%. Advances under Facility C initially bear 
interest at a rate equal to LIBOR (as adjusted) plus a margin. The margin over LIBOR is in the range 0.3% to 0.5% in accordance with a leverage 
grid. As at 31 December 2006, the margin was 0.35%. 
The undrawn committed borrowing facilities, which mature in 2011, amounted to £86.4m (2005: £95.5m) having taken into account £7.1m 
(2005: £5.8m) utilised for letters of credit and guarantees.

From time to time, the Group is involved in various claims and lawsuits incidental to the ordinary course of its business. The outcome of such 
litigation and the timing of any potential liability cannot be readily foreseen, as it is often subject to legal proceedings. Based on information 
currently available, the Directors consider that the cost to the Group of an unfavourable outcome arising from such litigation is unlikely to have 
a materially adverse effect on the ﬁ nancial position of the Group in the foreseeable future.
The provision for claims of £4.0m (2005: £8.0m) represents an estimate of the amounts payable in connection with identiﬁ ed claims from 
customers, former employees and other plaintiffs and associated legal costs. The timing of the cash outﬂ ow relating to the provisions is 
uncertain but is likely to be within one year. During 2006, a lawsuit ﬁ led in Puerto Rico in 2002 against one of the Group’s subsidiaries in the 
US, was settled and the lawsuit dismissed. Details of contingent liabilities in respect of claims are set out in note 27.
On the expiry of certain contracts, the Group is required to incur costs to dispose of assets, repair premises and reduce headcount. The other 
provision of £0.5m (2005: £0.9m) is an estimate of the cost of meeting these obligations. The provision is likely to be utilised over a period of 
one to ten years. 58 Intertek Group plc Annual Report

Pension schemes
The Group operates a number of pension schemes throughout the world. In most locations, these are deﬁ ned contribution arrangements. 
However, there are signiﬁ cant deﬁ ned beneﬁ t schemes in the United Kingdom and in Hong Kong. These are funded schemes, with assets held 
in separate trustee administered funds. Other funded deﬁ ned beneﬁ t schemes are not considered to be material and are therefore accounted 
for as if they were deﬁ ned contribution schemes. The schemes in the United Kingdom and Hong Kong were closed to new entrants with effect 
from 1 April 2002 and 1 December 2000, respectively.
The Group recognises any actuarial gains and losses in each period in equity through the Consolidated statement of recognised income and 
expense.

See (b) below for pension interest cost and expected return on scheme assets recognised in the income statement.
b) The pension cost for the deﬁ ned beneﬁ t schemes was assessed in accordance with the advice of qualiﬁ ed actuaries. The last full triennial 
actuarial valuation of the UK pension scheme was carried out as at 31 March 2004 but this has been updated to 31 December 2006 for 
IAS 19 purposes. The last full actuarial valuation of the Hong Kong scheme was carried out as at 31 December 2005, for local accounting 
purposes but this has been updated to 31 December 2006 for IAS 19 purposes.

Annualised expected return on scheme assets    6.70% 6.80% 6.30% 6.50% 6.60% 6.70%
The expected rates of return on scheme assets are determined by reference to relevant indices which take into account the current level of 
expected returns on risk free investments, the historical level of risk premium associated with equities and the expectation for future returns on 
such assets. The overall expected rate of return is calculated by weighting the individual rates in accordance with the anticipated balance in the 
plan’s investment portfolio.
Where investments are held in bonds and cash, the expected long-term rate of return is taken to be the yields generally prevailing on such 
assets at the balance sheet date. A higher rate of return is expected on equity investments. This is based on an out-performance assumption 
over gilt yields. 62 Intertek Group plc Annual Report

* The retirement arrangement in Hong Kong pays lump sums to members instead of pensions at the point they retire. Since the amount of the lump sum is not related to 
the life expectancy of the members, the post retirement mortality is not a relevant assumption for the Hong Kong scheme.
The table above, shows the number of years a male or female is expected to live, assuming they were aged either 40 or 65 at 31 December. 
The 2006 mortality assumptions are based on an actuarial table ‘PA 92 medium cohort, projected by an individual’s year of birth’. In 2005 the 
table used was ‘PA (90) with an age rating of -7 years’.
k) Sensitivity analysis
The table below sets out the sensitivity on the pension assets and liabilities as at 31 December 2006 of the two main assumptions. Details of

Share-based payments

in note 25. The share option scheme has been discontinued and the last options under the scheme were granted on 13 September 2005.
In accordance with IFRS 2, the fair value of services received in return for shares and share options granted to employees, is measured by 
reference to the fair value of shares and share options granted. In accordance with the transitional provisions in IFRS 1 and IFRS 2, the 
recognition and measurement principles in IFRS 2 have not been applied to share option grants made prior to 7 November 2002. The estimate 
of the fair value of the services received is measured based on the Black-Scholes formula, a ﬁ nancial model used to calculate the fair value of 
shares and share options. 
During the year ended 31 December 2006, the Group recognised an expense of £2.4m (2005: £1.9m) in respect of outstanding share and 
share option awards granted from 7 November 2002 onwards.

The Group made seven acquisitions during the year, all of which were paid for in cash.
 
The main acquisition was that of the business and assets of Alta Analytical Laboratories Inc. (Oil, Chemical & Agri) in California, USA on
30 November 2006, for £14.0m. Alta provides a variety of analytical services to pharmaceutical and clinical research organisations.
 
a) In respect of Alta, an analysis of the net assets acquired and the fair value to the Group is set out below. The analysis is provisional due to 
the timing of the acquisition and amendments may be made to these ﬁ gures in the subsequent accounting period with a corresponding 
adjustment to goodwill.

Goodwill of £10.2m represents the value to the Group of acquiring the services of the highly skilled workforce in Alta which, combined with 
the customer base which is valued as an intangible asset of £1.4m, allows the Group direct access to the North American market for
bioanalysis. The goodwill also reﬂ ects the synergies that the Group expects to generate with one of the Group’s existing European businesses.
 
The proﬁ t of Alta for the period 1 January 2006 to 30 November 2006 was £0.9m. The proﬁ t attributable to the Group from the date of 
acquisition to 31 December 2006 was £17,000.   64 Intertek Group plc Annual Report

The accounting policy alignments relate to depreciation of £0.8m and consumables of £0.1m to bring the accounting for these items into line 
with Group policy. The fair value adjustment of £0.4m against property, plant and equipment relates to a reduction in property on valuation 
and £0.3m against receivables relates to additional bad debt provisions. The other intangible assets of £4.2m represent contractual and non-
contractual client relationships.
The goodwill of £10.7m arises as follows:
         £m
Akzo Nobel         2.9
Polychemlab         3.1
Caleb Brett Iberica         3.3
Others         1.4
Total goodwill         10.7
Akzo Nobel
The goodwill of £2.9m for Akzo Nobel mainly represents the future income that the Group expects to generate from acquiring an established 
business in the electrical testing market in Japan, which is regarded as a key strategic country.
Polychemlab
The goodwill of £3.1m for Polychemlab represents the value of the highly skilled workforce and future income that the Group expects to obtain
from being located in a key site in the chemical industry in the Netherlands and the ability to generate revenue by putting third party work
through the lab.
Caleb Brett Iberica
The goodwill of £3.3m for Caleb Brett Iberica primarily represents future income that the Group expects to obtain from acquiring established 
businesses in the strategically important cargo inspection market in Spain and Portugal.
These acquisitions contributed proﬁ ts to the Group from their respective dates of acquisition to 31 December 2006 of £0.8m. 
c) The Group revenue and proﬁ t for the year ended 31 December 2006 would have been £690.3m and £71.6m respectively if all the 
acquisitions made in 2006, were assumed to have been made on 1 January 2006.

d) Details of 2005 acquisitions
The Group made a number of acquisitions, all for cash, of which the main one was the acquisition on 11 November 2005 of the business and 
assets of Automotive Research Laboratory based in Texas, USA for a cash consideration, including costs, of £20.1m.  
i) An analysis of the net assets acquired and the fair value to the Group is set out below:

The fair value adjustment to property, plant and equipment of £3.7m relates to the revaluation of the property. 
Goodwill of £9.7m represents primarily the value of its qualiﬁ ed workforce and the anticipated growth that the Group expects to achieve by 
packaging the services offered by Automotive Research with a complementary business already in the Group to offer a combined service to the 
Group’s global customers. 
Intangibles of £3.7m represent the value placed on customer relationships.
The proﬁ t of Automotive Research Laboratory for the period 1 January 2005 to 11 November 2005 was approximately £1.3m. The contribution  
to the Group from the date of acquisition to 31 December 2005 was £0.4m.

The fair value adjustment to property, plant and equipment of £1.5m relates to the revaluation of a property. Goodwill of £12.0m primarily 
represents the value gained by the Group of extending its service offering or entering a new territory which can then be leveraged through the 
rest of the Group. Also included within goodwill is the value associated with gaining a highly skilled workforce. 
Intangibles of £7.0m represent the value placed on customer relationships.

These acquisitions contributed proﬁ t to the Group from the date of acquisition to 31 December 2005 of £0.6m. 
iii) The Group revenue and proﬁ t for the year ended 31 December 2005 would have been approximately £605.7m and £62.4m respectively if all 
the acquisitions made in 2005, were assumed to be made on 1 January 2005.  
e)   On 9 January 2007, the Group acquired the whole of the share capital of Umitek Limited for £12.9m. Due to the timing of the acquisition,
the fair value of the net assets acquired has not yet been determined. A provisional analysis of net assets acquired is set out below which 
will be subject to amendment once the value of  these net assets and fair value adjustments are fully determined. The goodwill will also be
analysed to determine whether there are any intangible assets which should be recognised separately.

25 Share schemes
a)  Share option schemes
The Company established a share option scheme for senior management in March 1997. The maximum number of options that can be granted 
under the scheme have been allocated and that scheme has been discontinued. In May 2002, the Intertek Group plc 2002 Share Option Plan 
(the 2002 Plan) and the Intertek Group plc 2002 Approved Share Option Plan (the Approved Plan) were established for employees to be 
granted at the discretion of the Remuneration Committee. These plans have also been discontinued and the last grants under these plans were 
made in September 2005.

b) Long Term Incentive Plan
As explained in the Remuneration Report on page 25, deferred and matching shares are awarded under this plan. The ﬁ rst awards were 
granted on 7 April 2006 and consisted of 244,222 deferred shares and 128,194 matching shares. The awards will vest on 7 April 2009, subject 
to fulﬁ lment of the performance conditions. In respect of the deferred shares there were 5,610 forfeitures and 171 exercises (for which 5 shares 
had been issued as at 31 December 2006) arising on employees leaving the Group. In respect of the matching shares there were no forfeitures 
and no exercises during the period. 
Details of the share option schemes and the Long Term Incentive Plan are shown in the Remuneration Report on pages 24 to 26. 
26 Financial instruments 
Details of the Group’s treasury controls are set out in the Performance Review on pages 13 and 14.
Exposures to credit, interest rate and currency risks arises in the normal course of the Group’s business. Derivative ﬁ nancial instruments are 
used to hedge exposure to ﬂ uctuations in foreign exchange rates and interest rates.
a) Credit risk
Transactions involving derivative ﬁ nancial instruments are with counterparties who have sound credit ratings. Given this, management does not 
expect any counterparty to fail to meet its obligations.
At the balance sheet date there were no signiﬁ cant concentrations of credit risk. The maximum exposure to credit risk is represented by the 
carrying amount of each ﬁ nancial asset, including derivative ﬁ nancial instruments, in the balance sheet. 68 Intertek Group plc Annual Report
26 Financial instruments continued 
b) Interest rate risk
Hedging
The Group adopts a policy of ensuring that between 33% and 67% of its exposure to changes in interest rates on borrowings is on a ﬁ xed rate 
basis. Interest rate swaps, denominated in various currencies, have been entered into to achieve an appropriate mix of ﬁ xed and ﬂ oating rate 
exposure within the Group’s policy. The swaps mature over the next two years and have ﬁ xed swap rates ranging from 2.9% to 5.3%. At
31 December 2006, the Group had interest rate swaps with a notional contract amount of £97.4m (2005: £110.4m).
The Group designates interest rate swaps as hedging instruments in cash ﬂ ow hedges and states them at fair value. 
The net fair value of swaps at 31 December 2006, was £0.4m (2005: £1.7m) comprising assets of £0.4m (2005: £1.7m) and liabilities of £nil 
(2005: £nil). These amounts were recognised as fair value derivatives.
Under the interest rate swap agreements, the Group agrees with other parties to exchange, at speciﬁ ed intervals, the difference between ﬁ xed 
rate and ﬂ oating rate interest amounts calculated by reference to an agreed notional principal amount. The interest rate proﬁ le of the Group’s 
ﬁ nancial assets at 31 December 2006, is set out below:

c) Foreign currency risk
The net assets of foreign subsidiaries represent a signiﬁ cant portion of the Group’s shareholders’ funds and a substantial percentage of the 
Group’s revenue and operating costs are incurred in currencies other than sterling. Because of the high proportion of international activity, the 
Group’s proﬁ t is exposed to exchange rate ﬂ uctuations. Two types of risk arise as a result: (i) translation risk, that is, the risk of adverse currency 
ﬂ uctuations in the translation of foreign currency operations and foreign assets and liabilities into sterling and (ii) transaction risk, that is, the 
risk that currency ﬂ uctuations will have a negative effect on the value of the Group’s commercial cash ﬂ ows in various currencies. 
Recognised assets and liabilities
Changes in the fair value of forward exchange contracts that economically hedge monetary assets and liabilities in foreign currencies and for 
which no hedge accounting is applied are recognised in the income statement. At 31 December 2006, the fair value of forward exchange 
contracts was £nil (2005: £nil).
Hedge of net investment in foreign subsidiaries
The Group’s foreign currency denominated loans are designated as a hedge of the Group’s investment in its respective subsidiaries.
The carrying amount of the loans at 31 December 2006, was £178.4m (2005: £190.7m).
A foreign exchange gain of £20.5m (2005: loss of £16.1m) was recognised in the translation reserve in equity on translation of these
loans to sterling. 70 Intertek Group plc Annual Report

d) Fair values
The table below sets out a comparison of the book values and corresponding fair values of all the Group’s ﬁ nancial instruments by category.

Estimation of fair values
The following summarises the major methods and assumptions used in estimating the fair values of ﬁ nancial instruments reﬂ ected in the
above table.
Derivatives
For interest rate swaps, bank valuations are used.
Interest bearing loans and borrowings
The fair value is the same as book value as the ﬂ oating interest rates were reset just prior to the year end. 
Trade and other receivables/payables
For receivables/payables with a remaining life of less than one year, the notional amount is deemed to reﬂ ect the fair value. All other 
receivables/payables are discounted to determine fair value.
Interest rates used for determining fair value
Prevailing market interest rates are used to discount cash ﬂ ows to determine the fair value of ﬁ nancial assets and liabilities.
e) Sensitivity analysis
In managing interest rate and currency risks the Group aims to reduce the impact of short term ﬂ uctuations on the Group’s earnings. Over
the longer term, however, permanent changes in foreign exchange and interest rates would have an impact on consolidated earnings.
At 31 December 2006, it is estimated that a general increase of one percentage point in interest rates would decrease the Group’s proﬁ t before 
tax by approximately £0.5m (2005: £0.5m). Interest rate swaps have been included in this calculation.
It is estimated that a general increase of one percentage point in the value of the sterling against the dollar (the main currency impacting the 
Group) would have decreased the Group’s proﬁ t before tax for 2006 by approximately £0.7m (2005: £0.6m). The forward exchange contracts 
have been included in this calculation.

Guarantees, letters of credit and performance bonds        6.4 5.8
Litigation
From time to time, the Group is involved in various claims and lawsuits incidental to the ordinary course of its business, including claims for 
damages, negligence and commercial disputes regarding inspection and testing and disputes with former employees. The Group is not 
currently party to any legal proceedings other than ordinary litigation incidental to the conduct of business.
The outcome of the litigation to which Intertek Group companies are party cannot be readily foreseen. Based on information currently 
available, the Directors consider that the cost to the Group of an unfavourable outcome arising from such litigation, is unlikely to have a 
materially adverse effect on the ﬁ nancial position of the Group in the foreseeable future.
The Group holds a professional indemnity insurance policy that provides coverage for certain claims from customers. The Directors consider this 
policy adequate for normal commercial purposes.

Company balance sheet
As at 31 December 2006 74 Intertek Group plc Annual Report
a) Accounting policies – Company
The following accounting policies have been applied consistently in 
dealing with items which are considered material in relation to the 
Company’s ﬁ nancial statements. No new accounting standards have 
been adopted in the year.
Basis of preparation
The ﬁ nancial statements have been prepared in accordance with 
applicable United Kingdom Accounting Standards and under the 
historical accounting rules.
The following principal accounting policies have been applied 
consistently throughout the year and preceding year in dealing with 
items which are considered material in relation to the Company’s 
ﬁ nancial statements. 
Under section 230(4) of the Companies Act 1985 the Company
is exempt from the requirement to present its own proﬁ t and
loss account.
Under Financial Reporting Standard 1 the Company is exempt from 
the requirement to prepare a cash ﬂ ow statement on the grounds 
that it is included in the consolidated accounts which it has prepared. 
Foreign currencies
Transactions in foreign currencies are recorded using the rate of 
exchange ruling at the date of the transaction. Monetary assets and 
liabilities in foreign currencies are translated into sterling at the rates 
of exchange prevailing at the balance sheet date or at the contracted 
rate if the transaction is covered by a forward exchange contract. All 
foreign exchange differences are taken to the proﬁ t and loss account. 
Taxation
The charge for taxation is based on the proﬁ t/(loss) for the year and 
takes into account taxation deferred by timing differences. 
Deferred tax is recognised, without discounting, in respect of all 
timing differences between the treatment of certain items for 
taxation and accounting purposes which have arisen but not reversed 
by the balance sheet date, except as otherwise required by FRS 19. 
Deferred tax assets in respect of timing differences are only 
recognised to the extent that it is more likely than not there will be 
suitable taxable proﬁ ts to offset the future reversal of these timing 
differences.
Classiﬁ cation of ﬁ nancial instruments issued by the Company
Following the adoption of the presentation requirements of FRS 25, 
ﬁ nancial instruments issued by the Company are treated as equity (i.e. 
forming part of shareholders’ funds) only to the extent that they meet 
the following two conditions:
i) they include no contractual obligations upon the Company to 
deliver cash or other ﬁ nancial assets or to exchange ﬁ nancial assets 
or ﬁ nancial liabilities with another party under conditions that are 
potentially unfavourable to the Company; and
ii) where the instrument will or may be settled in the Company’s own 
equity instruments, it is either a non-derivative that includes no 
obligation to deliver a variable number of the Company’s own 
equity instruments or is a derivative that will be settled by the 
Company’s exchanging a ﬁ xed amount of cash or other ﬁ nancial 
assets for a ﬁ xed number of its own equity instruments.
To the extent that this deﬁ nition is not met, the proceeds of issue are 
classiﬁ ed as a ﬁ nancial liability. Where the instrument so classiﬁ ed 
takes the legal form of the Company’s own shares, the amounts 
presented in these ﬁ nancial statements for called up share capital and 
share premium account exclude amounts in relation to those shares.
Finance payments associated with ﬁ nancial liabilities are dealt with
as part of interest payable and similar charges. Finance payments 
associated with ﬁ nancial instruments that are classiﬁ ed as part of 
shareholders’ funds are dealt with as appropriations in the 
reconciliation of movements in shareholders’ funds.
Dividends on shares presented within shareholders’ funds 
Dividends unpaid at the balance sheet date are only recognised
as a liability at that date to the extent that they are appropriately 
authorised and are no longer at the discretion of the Company. 
Unpaid dividends that do not meet these criteria are disclosed in
the notes to the ﬁ nancial statements.
Investments in subsidiaries
Investments in subsidiaries are stated at cost less any provisions for 
impairment.
Intercompany ﬁ nancial guarantees
When the Company enters into ﬁ nancial guarantee contracts to 
guarantee the indebtedness of other companies in the Group, the 
Company considers these to be insurance arrangements and accounts 
for them as such. In this respect the Company treats the guarantee 
contract as a contingent liability until such time as it becomes 
probable that the Company will be required to make a payment 
under the guarantee.

Notes to the ﬁ nancial statements 77 Intertek Group plc Annual Report
We have audited the Group and Parent Company ﬁ nancial statements 
(the ‘’ﬁ nancial statements’’) of Intertek Group plc for the year ended 
31 December 2006 which comprise Group Income Statement, the 
Group and Parent Company Balance Sheets, the Group Cash Flow 
Statement, the Group Statement of Recognised Income and Expense 
and the related notes. These ﬁ nancial statements have been prepared 
under the accounting policies set out therein. We have also audited 
the information in the Directors’ Remuneration Report that is 
described as having been audited. 
This report is made solely to the Company’s members, as a body, in 
accordance with section 235 of the Companies Act 1985. Our audit 
work has been undertaken so that we might state to the Company’s 
members those matters we are required to state to them in an 
auditor’s report and for no other purpose. To the fullest extent 
permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility to 
anyone other than the Company and the Company’s members as a 
body, for our audit work, for this report, or for the opinions we have 
formed.
Respective responsibilities of Directors and auditors
The Directors’ responsibilities for preparing the Annual Report and
the Group ﬁ nancial statements in accordance with applicable law and 
International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the 
EU, and for preparing the Parent Company ﬁ nancial statements and 
the Directors’ Remuneration Report in accordance with applicable law 
and UK Accounting Standards (UK Generally Accepted Accounting 
Practice) are set out in the Statement of Directors’ Responsibilities
on page 21.
Our responsibility is to audit the ﬁ nancial statements and the part of 
the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited in accordance with 
relevant legal and regulatory requirements and International 
Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland).
We report to you our opinion as to whether the ﬁ nancial statements 
give a true and fair view and whether the ﬁ nancial statements and 
the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited have 
been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 1985 
and, as regards the Group ﬁ nancial statements, Article 4 of the IAS 
Regulation. We also report to you whether in our opinion the 
information given in the Directors’ Report is consistent with the 
ﬁ nancial statements. The information given in the Directors’ Report 
includes that speciﬁ c information presented in the Performance 
Review that is cross referred from the Business Review section of the 
Directors’ Report.
In addition we report to you if, in our opinion, the Company has
not kept proper accounting records, if we have not received all the 
information and explanations we require for our audit, or if 
information speciﬁ ed by law regarding directors’ remuneration
and other transactions is not disclosed.
We review whether the Corporate Governance Statement reﬂ ects
the Company’s compliance with the nine provisions of the 2003 
Combined Code speciﬁ ed for our review by the Listing Rules of the 
Financial Services Authority, and we report if it does not. We are not 
required to consider whether the Board’s statements on internal 
control cover all risks and controls, or form an opinion on the 
effectiveness of the Group’s corporate governance procedures or
its risk and control procedures.
We read the other information contained in the Annual Report
and consider whether it is consistent with the audited ﬁ nancial 
statements. We consider the implications for our report if we become 
aware of any apparent misstatements or material inconsistencies with 
the ﬁ nancial statements. Our responsibilities do not extend to any 
other information.
Basis of audit opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards 
on Auditing (UK and Ireland) issued by the Auditing Practices Board. 
An audit includes examination, on a test basis, of evidence relevant
to the amounts and disclosures in the ﬁ nancial statements and the 
part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited. It also 
includes an assessment of the signiﬁ cant estimates and judgments 
made by the Directors in the preparation of the ﬁ nancial statements, 
and of whether the accounting policies are appropriate to the
Group’s and Company’s circumstances, consistently applied and 
adequately disclosed.
We planned and performed our audit so as to obtain all the 
information and explanations which we considered necessary in order 
to provide us with sufﬁ cient evidence to give reasonable assurance 
that the ﬁ nancial statements and the part of the Directors’ 
Remuneration Report to be audited are free from material 
misstatement, whether caused by fraud or other irregularity or error. 
In forming our opinion we also evaluated the overall adequacy of the 
presentation of information in the ﬁ nancial statements and the part 
of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited.
Opinion
In our opinion:
the Group ﬁ nancial statements give a true and fair view, in 
accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the EU, of the state of the 
Group’s affairs as at 31 December 2006 and of its proﬁ t for the 
year then ended;
the Group ﬁ nancial statements have been properly prepared in 
accordance with the Companies Act 1985 and Article 4 of the IAS 
Regulation;
the Parent Company ﬁ nancial statements give a true and fair view, 
in accordance with UK Generally Accepted Accounting Practice, of 
the state of the Parent Company’s affairs as at 31 December 2006;
the Parent Company ﬁ nancial statements and the part of the 
Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited have been properly 
prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 1985; and
the information given in the Directors’ Report is consistent with 
the ﬁ nancial statements.

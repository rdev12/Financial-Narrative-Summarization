customers completed their transition 

see the second half of the year achieve

the significant challenge of achieving 
increasing volumes whilst maintaining 
the cost reductions and benefits gained 

where our suppliers were requesting 
price increases for the majority of our

our past successes and reduce costs 


savings were in part due to the economies 
of scale as well as successful engineering 
activities to reduce consumable usage

without affecting the quality of the 

As volumes increased our operational 
teams processed the increased volumes 
with only a modest increase in headcount

the cost efficiencies as record levels of 
productivity were once again achieved in

Regus Report & Accounts 2006 02
Operating profit has increased by 73.8% while 
at the same time we have grown the scale of 
our business measured in workstations by 
45.4% year on year. This profitable growth 
and our strong cash conversion has enabled 
the Group to fund its expansion plans with 
minimal external funding. Net cash was  
£23.4 million at 31 December 2006 (2005: 
£36.0 million). 
In an industry where size and scale are  
critical in order to provide customers with the 
greatest range of product, service and price 
offerings and achieve operating efficiencies, 
our network at 31 December 2006 consisted 
of 790 centres in 64 countries, operating  
under the respected Regus and HQ brands.
f inancial performance
Group revenue has increased by 46.8% to £680.0 million and gross profit 
by 57.1% to £184.1 million. Excluding the impact of new centre growth the 
like for like improvement was 9.0% and 29.1% respectively. This overall 
result was driven by average occupancy increasing to 81.8% from 78.0% in 
2005 and REVPAW increasing 7.6% from £5,890 to £6,340. Earnings (profit 
after tax) grew by 83.7% to £82.3 million and basic earnings per share (EPS) 
increased by 3.9p to 8.4p.  
On 13 March 2006, we signed a new £100 million five-year revolving credit 
and letter of credit facility and in April added £50 million of term debt. The 
latter was used to finance the acquisition of the UK business. The new facilities 
have been negotiated on significantly more favourable terms, reflecting the 
strong financial progress the business has made over the last two years.  
This year’s results are 
a testament to Regus’
strong business model. 03 Regus Report & Accounts 2006
Our strategy remains one of 
controlled and disciplined 
growth with the aim to be 
number one in all the markets 
in which we operate.
Sustaining growth
We continue to implement our controlled and disciplined expansion strategy. 
To supplement our strong organic growth, during the financial year we  
acquired 28 businesses for a net consideration of £88.5 million. These  
businesses have all been successfully integrated into the Regus network.  
In the year to 31 December 2006 our workstation capacity increased in line 
with our expansion plans by 45.4% to 120,108 workstations (December 
2005: 82,586 workstations) with the acquisition of Regus UK accounting  
for around 25,000 workstations.  
Dividend
Given the robust performance and positive outlook we are pleased to  
announce that Regus will be paying a dividend. Subject to the approval of 
shareholders at the 2007 Annual General Meeting (AGM), the final dividend 
of 0.6p will be paid on 1 June 2007 to shareholders on the register at the 
close of business on 27 April 2007.  
The Group continues to monitor its capital structure and retains flexibility  
to repurchase its shares in the market place should surplus cash resources 
be available.
Corporate Responsibility
The Board believes that the integration of Corporate Responsibility through-
out the business and the incorporation of broader social and environmental 
issues into day to day decision making will benefit all our key stakeholders 
and better enable us to achieve our target levels of performance. This year 
we will set up a formal Corporate Responsibility Committee to oversee CR 
strategy. The Committee’s aim is to ensure that we take a sustainable  
approach to business – to do the right thing for our shareholders, our  
customers, our suppliers, the community and the world around us.
We will be commissioning a series of initiatives to reduce energy  
consumption. Through our virtual office and video conferencing services we 
will continue to promote teleworking and therefore support a longer term 
approach to tackling the impact of climate change on the environment.
Our stakeholders
We rely on the goodwill and commitment of our landlords, suppliers,  
customers and investors as we continue to maintain our record of double 
digit sales growth since 2003. The commitment, loyalty and efforts of our 
team members have played a key role in our success. Our people are 
integral to differentiating Regus from our competitors and maintaining the 
Company’s position as the international leader in outsourced workplace 
solutions.  
Outlook
Our strategy remains one of controlled and disciplined growth with the aim 
to be number one in all the markets in which we operate. This well proven 
strategy has resulted in our third year of consistent growth, both organically 
and through acquisitions, and we expect this to continue.  
We will continue to open centres wherever our research indicates there  
is a profitable opportunity to increase our geographic footprint and better 
serve our customers. In addition, we will continue to acquire complementary 
businesses, which meet our strict investment criteria, enabling us to move 
into new markets and develop a wider customer base.

Expanding our network
Our growth in 2006 has been exceptional. During the last financial year 
we opened 218 centres (inclusive of 91 centres in the UK) which added a 
further 37,522 workstations to our capacity. Our expansion programme will  
continue in 2007 with openings planned across all four regions.  
In addition we will continue to add complementary businesses, which meet 
our strict investment criteria. Several of these acquisitions have allowed us to 
move into new markets such as airport locations and corporate outsourcing 
and develop a wider customer base (Government and support agencies) as 
well as facilitating a broader service for our existing clients.  
innovative products and services
One of our core skills is our ability to anticipate the changing demands of our 
customers. We therefore focus our research on developing new products 
and services which meet the future needs of our customers.  
Some examples of recent developments include:
> Network Access – our membership programme, which provides  
 members with immediate, unlimited access to our global network of  
 business centres.  
> Managed Office Solutions – a fully outsourced office solution for larger  
 clients where we manage the day to day running of the office.  
> Regus Express – a retail/business centre which caters for the needs of  
 the mobile worker. Currently located at airport locations within the USA,  
 our intention is to implement this concept in other airports and travel hubs 
 in major cities across the world.  
investment in systems and technology
The growth of the business in 2006 has emphasised the need for Regus 
to have best in class systems to support its unique market position. These 
systems will not only be used for the benefit of our internal needs but as a 
platform to bring a broader range of services to our client.  
A flexible, secure and scaleable IT infrastructure is critical to our clients 
needs. Bandwidth on demand, guaranteed quality of service, increased 
security and higher service level performance are some of the benefits that 
we are now able to offer to our clients.  
The scale of our operations are being brought to bear in the sourcing and 
management of our IT services, bringing benefits to our customers while 
providing further differentiation from our competitors.  
As an example of this, we are partnering with some of the leading names  
in IT and telecoms to enable us to develop next generation Converged  
Network Solutions (CNS). The centralised nature of CNS provides Regus 
with economies of scale, lower cost of ownership, speed to market and 
a wider range of services that enable greater revenue opportunities and 
provides our customers with  better control of their cost bases.  
Additionally, Regus operates the world’s largest video-conferencing  
network in terms of geographical reach. The need for our customers to 
maximise their productivity and the increasing environmental concerns 
around business travel have driven continued growth of this valuable  
service. Consequently we intend to make further investments in this area  
to maximise its growing importance to our clients. 
Regus Report & Accounts 2006 04
t his has been another outstanding 12 months 
for the Group with record results for the 
third year in succession. We have delivered 
strong, disciplined growth and improved 
performance in all of our key business metrics 
including revenues, profit and earnings per 
share. Our performance in 2006 demonstrates 
the benefits of our longer term approach to 
the development of the business. We continue 
to improve financial performance through 
growing our network of business centres 
and developing new products and services 
to meet the evolving needs of our clients.  
Strategy and objectives 
Our strategy and objectives are simple – to use 
our skills and resources to generate profitable 
growth and cash.
We achieve these objectives through the following 
activities: Operational excellence
Our commitment to operational excellence is one of our key differentiators. 
Our business centre staff adopt globally defined standards of business 
processes and procedures. A rolling programme of quality audits are  
conducted at least annually in each centre and a scoring system helps 
ensure that centre teams focus on achieving the highest standard of  
operational excellence across our network. In this way we can ensure 
clients experience a high quality and consistent level of service irrespective 
of location.  
In addition to developing systems, our back office teams support our client 
facing staff with the efficient administration of the business. Our finance, 
human resource, billing and procurement teams operate on a regional basis 
allowing us to realise consistency of delivery and scale efficiencies.  
Developing our brand
Our brands and business concept are recognised and respected globally. A 
consistent high quality product delivery is available in all of the world’s most 
in demand cities providing business executives the Regus experience on a 
global basis. 
In 2006, we invested in TV and radio advertising in the UK and USA –  
specifically targeted at building awareness of the Regus brand. Our  
development of Regus Express and Network Access Card has allowed  
us to further promote our brand.  
In addition to our flagship Regus brand we also operate under our HQ 
brand primarily in the USA. We continue to monitor options and opportunities 
for developing our products under various trademarks as part of the Regus 
Group network.  
Developing our team members
The skills, enthusiasm and commitment of our people are key to Regus’ 
success. We recognise the need to recruit high quality individuals and to 
develop the potential of our staff in order to provide a positive customer 
experience to our clients.  
Our internal training programmes include regular operational updates,  
online training modules and classroom based training at our Global School  
of Excellence in Dallas, USA. During 2006 we trained 238 General and  
Operational Managers in Dallas, various locations across the UK and 
Mexico City. In addition 254 team members completed a three week  
induction course. Our staff have taken over 10,000 online training modules 
equivalent to nearly 3,000 hours of training.
t he future 
The Group maintained strong growth in 2006, driven by all three parts  
of our strategy. Our core business centre operations delivered a solid  
performance, mobile and home working continues to grow at rates in  
excess of 20% and our corporate outsourcing business is poised for  
significant growth in the medium to long term. Looking ahead, we will  
focus on driving margin improvement in our mature business and continue 
to invest in new markets and products to drive the long term growth of  
the business.  
As such I am confident that the Group will continue to deliver attractive 
rates of growth and cash generation in the year ahead.

f uture industry trends 
We believe we are well placed to take advantage 
of the favourable trends in our industry and these 
will contribute to the continued development of 
Group. These include:
> Fragmented market
 Regus has the only global serviced office network,  
 with no other players having more than 75 centres.  
 Our geographic footprint spans 790 centres across  
 64 countries and we will continue to seek opportunities 
 to grow our network and acquire complementary  
 businesses, enabling us to move into new markets  
 and develop a wider customer base.  
> Growth in home and mobile working
 The development of a mobile workforce has gathered 
 pace and employers and employees are increasingly  
 adopting flexible working practices. Our meeting room, 
 video-conferencing and virtual office products offer  
 solutions to these workers and through our Regus  
 Express outlets, we are bringing these solutions even  
 closer to our client base.  
> Continued adoption of outsourcing
 Companies large and small are realising the benefits  
 of outsourcing their office management in order to  
 concentrate on their core business. Regus helps  
 customers to minimise the complexity of property  
 management through providing clients with a single  
 property and service provider. Outsourcing can help  
 our customers reduce their cost base and provide  
 them with flexibility to respond to their changing  
 business needs.   americas
Regional review
Our business in the Americas comprises Canada, USA and South America.  
The region has 429 centres across 13 countries. Our main business in the 
USA operates 353 centres. During the year we added 67 centres which 
increased the average number of workstations from 47,311 in 2005 to 
52,611 in 2006. Acquisitions accounted for 58 of these new centres, with 
the balance coming from the opening of nine fully owned centres. The region 
delivered revenues of £305.9 million – up 16.9% on 2005 and achieved an 
average occupancy of 86% through the year (2005: 81%).  
Looking ahead into 2007 we will continue our aim to maximise yield in our 
existing centres and look to grow our portfolio in key cities where we have 
minimal representation. The adoption of flexible working and environmental 
pressures have further increased the demand for our product. We also intend 
to expand our Regus Express concept (a retail/business centre which caters 
for the needs of the mobile worker) across other airports in the USA. This 
expansion will enable us to gain brand awareness and promote and sell our 
core business.

Our business in EMEA encompasses 188 centres across 38 countries. 
During the year we opened 15 new centres, which increased the average 
number of workstations from 25,871 in 2005 to 27,139 in 2006. Acquisitions 
accounted for two of these new centres, with the balance of 13 coming 
from organic growth – eight fully owned centres, three joint ventures, one 
managed centre and one franchise operation. We opened centres in new 
markets such as Lebanon, Abu Dhabi, Bahrain, Nigeria, Kenya and Algeria. 
The region delivered revenues of £195.9 million – up 18.4% on 2005 and 
achieved an average occupancy of 79% through the year (2005: 73%).  
Looking ahead into 2007 we will continue to improve occupancy and margin 
in our existing centres and expand our network into new markets.

Our business in Asia operates in 67 centres across 12 countries. During 
the year we opened 30 new centres, which almost doubled the number of 
workstations from 5,475 in 2005 to 9,009 in 2006. Acquisitions accounted  
for 14 of these new centres, with the balance of 16 coming from the opening 
of 15 fully owned centres and one managed centre. The region delivered 
revenues of £50.9 million – up 51.5% on 2005 and achieved an average  
occupancy of 72% through the year (2005: 75%). This decrease in occupancy 
was due to the impact of new centres, which can take six to 12 months to 
achieve occupancy rates on par with mature centres.  
Looking ahead into 2007 we will continue to consolidate our position as 
the largest provider of serviced offices across all Asia Pacific markets. To 
achieve this objective we plan to continue our aggressive growth plan while 
continuing to improve the efficiency of our current portfolio of centres. To 
facilitate this increase in demand and capitalise on scale efficiencies we will 
be adding a new customer service centre in the Philippines to handle all 
incoming enquiries.

Regus Report & Accounts 2006 08
Top left: Hong Kong – Queens Road
Top right: Shanghai – Silver Centre On 19 April 2006, we acquired the remaining 58% interest in Regus UK for 
a gross consideration (including fees) of £89.4 million (£60.9 million net of 
cash acquired of £28.5 million). At the date of acquisition our UK business 
operated 91 centres. During the year, we subsequently acquired the  
Gainsborough and Longford business centres and Managed Office Solutions 
– a company specialising in property outsourcing.  
At the year end our UK business operated 106 centres of which just under 
half are in the Greater London area. At 31 December 2006, UK capacity 
stood at 26,389 workstations.  
In the full year 2006, Regus UK generated revenues of £168.4 million. Since 
acquisition, we have seen a significant increase in occupancy – rising from 
72% at April 2006 to a year end level of 81%. A restructured management 
team, renewed investment in our centres, investment in marketing and a 
drive on enquiries has helped to achieve this improved performance.  
During April of this year our new UK CEO, Nick Wood, will be joining us. 
Nick comes from DSG International where he has held several senior 
positions, last of which was Divisional Managing Director of the Group’s 
Communication Division. Prior to this, Nick worked in venture capital and 
business development for a number of companies including 3i plc.
Looking ahead into 2007 we will continue to focus on new sales and  
marketing channels such as TV and radio. In the first quarter of this year  
we launched a real time booking system for meeting rooms and have  
recently launched our UK Training Centre Product specially geared to  
hosting conferences.

09 Regus Report & Accounts 2006
Top left: Glasgow – West George Street
Top right: London – Throgmorton Street Our 2006 financial performance has been impressive, reflecting strong like 
for like growth and the additional contribution from acquisitions and 2006 
new centre openings. These results have been achieved whilst also investing 
in people, infrastructure, technology and marketing to secure future growth.
The three key operational drivers have all been improved. The weighted  
average number of workstations increased by 36.4% to 107,257. At the 
same time average occupancy increased from 78% to 82% and average 
revenue per occupied workstation (REVPOW) increased by 2.4% from 
£7,551 to £7,732. This results in an increase in REVPAW of 7.6% from 
£5,890 to £6,340.  
Against a relatively fixed cost base these factors have contributed to a 
£34.9 million increase in operating profit from £47.3 million in 2005 to 
£82.2 million in 2006.  
Revenue and centre contribution (excluding non-recurring items) 
Revenue for the Group rose 46.8% to £680.0 million (2005: £463.3 million) 
and centre contribution increased 57.2% to £184.1 million (2005: £117.1 
million).  
This year-on-year movement can be analysed as follows:  
 Revenue Centre contribution Margin
 £m £m (a) %
2005  463.3 117.1 25.3
Growth in mature business 39.9 34.0
Subtotal 503.2 151.1 30.0
Centres added in 2005 33.8 12.7
Centres added in 2006 147.6 20.2
Centres closed (4.6) 0.1
2006 680.0 184.1 27.1
(a) Excludes non-recurring items of £0.1 million in 2005.
The mature business, defined as those centres owned and operated at 
least 12 months prior to 1 January 2006, increased revenue by £39.9 million 
principally driven through improvements in occupancy, which increased from 
79% to 84%. This resulted in a £34.0 million increase in centre contribution.
Centres added in 2005 contributed a further £33.8 million of revenue and 
£12.7 million of contribution. This was due to both underlying improvements 
in the performance of these sites and the impact of including them for a full 
12 months.  
Expansions in 2006 include the repurchase of the UK business and a 
number of bolt-on acquisitions and new centres. These contributed a  
further £147.6 million of revenue and contribution of £20.2 million. 
Taking all this together contribution margin improved from 25.3% to 27.1%.
administration expenses
Administration expenses (excluding non-recurring items incurred in 2005) 
have increased to 15.0% of revenue for the full year (2005: 14.0%). This 
increase arises principally from the impact of growth related investments 
incurred in the second half of 2005 and the first half of 2006 ahead of the 
full revenue impact of growth.

(b) Average revenue per available workstation. These growth related costs focus on three main areas:
> Marketing costs to drive occupancy primarily in new centres
> Costs to support the growing scale of the business (e.g. country managers, 
 improved systems and processes)
> Costs necessarily incurred to secure workstation growth in a controlled  
 and efficient manner (e.g. business development teams to identify, secure 
 and integrate new business).
As the growth benefits have been delivered, administration expenses as 
a proportion of revenue have fallen from 16.1% in the first half of 2006 to 
14.1% in the second half of 2006.  
Non-recurring items
In 2005, the Group incurred £4.9 million of non-recurring costs (net), which 
primarily relate to the integration of HQ. No similar costs have been incurred 
in 2006.  
Operating profit
Operating profit was £82.2 million (2005: £47.3 million) representing a  
margin of 12.1% (2005: 10.2%).  
Share of operating loss in joint ventures and associate
In the year ended 31 December 2006, the share of joint venture losses 
attributable to Regus reduced to £0.1 million (2005: £0.2 million loss). The 
underlying improvement in our mature joint ventures was masked by the  
impact of newly opened joint ventures, which recognised losses of £0.3  
million in the period due to the recognition of start up costs.  
During the period 1 January 2006 to 19 April 2006, the UK business was 
equity accounted as an associate. Our 42% shareholding resulted in a profit 
after tax for the period to 19 April of £1.2 million (2005 full year: £0.2 million).

Non cash unwinding of discount –

Total  (5.8) (8.6)
Interest payable has fallen despite a higher average debt balance in 2006  
as a result of refinancing our senior credit facility in March 2006 on more  
favourable terms. Lower interest receivable reflects a decrease in the average 
free cash balance from £55 million in 2005 to £50 million in 2006.  
Although the Group is now in an overall net cash position, a net cash  
interest charge should still be anticipated for 2007. This is driven by the costs  
of commitment fees on the senior credit facility and letter of credit issuance 
fees as well as the impact of incurring a net charge from the margin between 
interest rates on our deposits and borrowings.  
Underlying finance lease costs have fallen in line with the reduction in finance 
leases. The amortisation of deferred financing fees relates to the £2.1 million 
loan arrangement costs incurred on the new £150 million credit facility.
11 Regus Report & Accounts 2006
These results have been 
achieved whilst investing  
in people, infrastructure,  
technology and marketing  
to secure future growth. The 2005 charge of £4.3 million included the write off of the remaining 
deferred financing fees on the US$155 million credit facility repaid in March 
2006. The unwinding of discounted fair value adjustments on the Regus UK  
acquisition resulted in a non cash net financing charge of £2.1 million in 2006.
t axation
As the business performance has strengthened, it has become necessary 
to recognise in the balance sheet an asset for a greater proportion of the 
value of the tax losses that the Group holds. Accordingly in 2006, a credit  
of £12.9 million (2005: £15.0 million) has been recognised in the income 
statement, reflecting the increased deferred tax asset in the balance sheet. 
This has been partially offset by an £8.1 million tax charge (2005: £8.9  
million), which resulted in a net tax credit of £4.8 million (2005: £6.1 million) 
to the income statement. Consequently, despite being profitable, the Group 
has a net tax credit for the year to 31 December 2006. However, on a cash 
basis the Group paid £6.6 million (2005: £2.6 million) of tax across a small 
number of countries. This represents approximately 8.5% of profit before tax.
As at 31 December 2006, the Group had £197.9 million (2005: £270.2  
million) of tax losses to carry forward against future corporation tax liabilities, 
of which £111.0 million (2005: £172.0 million) are in the USA.  
Based upon continued profitable growth and no significant changes to the 
Group’s tax position the cash tax rate should be expected to rise through 
2007 to 2009 as the tax losses are progressively utilised. 
Earnings per share (EpS)
Basic EPS for the year rose to 8.4p (2005: 4.5p). This is based on weighted 
average number of shares of 984,792,040. This is unchanged on 2005. 
Diluted EPS rose by 3.8p to 8.3p (2005: 4.5p).  
Cash flow
Strong operating cash flow remains a prime feature of the Group. Driven  
by the improvement in operating profit and an improved working capital 
performance, operating cash flow increased by £54.7 million to £132.8  
million (2005: £78.1 million).
The Group’s cash flow statement has been summarised as follows:
  2006 2005
  £m £m
Operating cash flow  132.8 78.1
Tax and net interest paid  (10.1) (6.9)
Maintenance capex  (19.6) (5.9)
Free cash flow  103.1 65.3

Opening cash  74.1 82.3
Closing cash  80.9 74.1
During 2006 we acquired the remaining 58% interest in Regus UK and 27 
bolt on acquisitions for a net consideration of £88.5 million.

BASIC EPS (2005: 4.5p)
£132.8m
OPERATING CASH FLOW (2005: £78.1m) Goodwill and intangible assets relating to these acquisitions are £103.7 
million and £21.9 million respectively. The goodwill arising on the above 
acquisitions reflects the anticipated future benefits Regus can obtain from 
operating the businesses more efficiently, primarily through increasing  
occupancy and the addition of value adding services. The intangible amount 
relates to the brand, customer lists and software.
In addition to these acquisitions, we spent £26.7 million on opening 32 
owned centres – 15 in Asia Pacific, nine in the Americas and eight in EMEA. 
We also opened a further six centres through joint venture, management 
and franchise agreements.
This growth has been part financed by net borrowings of £23.0 million.
Following the above the Group’s net cash position can be analysed  
as follows:  
  2006 2005
  £m £m
Cash balance  80.9 74.1
Term loan  (50.0) (22.5)
Other loans  (3.6) (7.4)
Finance leases  (3.9) (8.2)
Net cash  23.4 36.0
Of the cash balance, £17.1 million (2005: £19.1 million) is blocked and not 
available for use by the business. These amounts have mainly been used as 
collateral against loan and lease obligations of the Group.  
Distributable reserves and dividend
During the year the Company created distributable reserves by undertaking 
a court approved cancellation of our share premium account of £153.5  
million, this resulted in a corresponding increase in distributable reserves. 
As a result, the Group has sufficient distributable reserves to pay dividends 
to its shareholders.
Given the Group’s strong cash generation and its future prospects the 
Board is proposing, subject to shareholder approval at the 2007 AGM, the 
payment of a final dividend of 0.6p per share. The total cost of this dividend 
payment will amount to £5.9 million. This dividend is expected to be paid  
on 1 June 2007 to shareholders on the register at the close of business on 
27 April 2007.

17 Regus Report & Accounts 2006 Corporate responsibility
The responsible management of our social, environmental and economic 
impact is integral to our business. Our commitment to Corporate  
Responsibility (CR) is not simply a response to increased market pressures 
in this area, but such issues reinforce the way that our business operates.  
The Board believes that the integration of CR throughout the business and 
the incorporation of broader social and environmental issues into day to day 
decision making will benefit all our key stakeholders and better enable us to 
achieve our target levels of business performance.  
Corporate Responsibility Committee
In 2007, we will set up a formal Corporate Responsibility Committee to  
oversee CR strategy. The Committee’s aim is to ensure that we take a  
sustainable approach to business – to do the right thing for our shareholders, 
our customers, our suppliers, the community and the world around us.  
Members of the Corporate Responsibility Committee will be drawn from 
across the business, to ensure that corporate responsibility is at the heart  
of our daily operations.
Its remit will be to provide strategic direction and guidance on all aspects of 
business practice and responsibility and ensure consistent implementation 
across our operations. The Committee’s priority is to set out a clear  
framework of responsibilities that are specific to Regus as well as those  
that are common to all large businesses.
In 2007 we will produce a Corporate Responsibility report which describes 
our main impacts, defines our strategy and sets out future priorities. This 
report will initially be based on our UK operations with a future priority to roll 
this out to our international operations.
Our stakeholders
We understand the issues that matter to our customers and stakeholders, 
and know that getting them right builds loyalty and makes our business 
more sustainable.
The Corporate Responsibility Committee will help ensure that social,  
environmental and ethical issues are a natural part of the way we do business.  
The Committee’s aim will be to ensure that we take a sustainable approach 
to business – to do the right thing for our shareholders, our customers, our 
suppliers, the community and the world around us.
Business integrity
A Group-wide Code of Ethics has been in place since January 2006. This 
sets out a number of fundamental principles which all our companies and 
employees are required to follow. In keeping with our decentralised approach, 
businesses are required to adopt their own codes which respect local 
cultures and businesses but which also set standards that are still no less 
exacting than those detailed in the Group-wide code. To a large extent 
these individual codes simply underpin and endorse existing practices. We 
operate a confidential whistle blowing service to support employees who 
want to eliminate wrongdoing in the workplace.
Environment and sustainability 
The nature of our business means that we have to recognise that we have 
an impact on the environment. We are committed to managing the way in 
which activities affect the environment by:
> Optimising the use of energy
> Ensuring efficient use of materials 
> Encouraging re use and recycling 
> Incorporating the principle of sustainable development.

 customers. We work to minimise, as far as possible,  
 any negative impacts associated with our business  
 activities. We will take account of the views of our  
 stakeholders on all aspects of our product development 
 and service delivery.
> Business partners and supply chain

> Communities and charities
 We believe in social investment and encourage our  
 operations to become active members of the societies 
 in which they operate, supporting employee involvement 
 wherever possible. We encourage charitable fundraising 
 and support charitable initiatives throughout the world. Environmental policy 
It is our policy to:
> Minimise the extent of the environmental impacts of operations within  
 our influence
> Strive to minimise any emissions or effluents in our business centres,  
 which may cause environmental damage
> Conserve energy through minimising consumption and maximising  
 efficiency
> Promote efficient purchasing which will both minimise waste and allow  
 materials to be recycled where appropriate
> Employ sound waste management practices
> Implement procedures and support information that enables compliance  
 with the law, regulations and code of practice relating to environmental  
 issues
> Monitor environmental performance, make regular reviews of the policy  
 and make improvements where possible.
Environmental impacts
The main environmental impacts of running our businesses are the generation 
of carbon emissions through the consumption of electricity, gas and transport 
activities, including business travel and commuting.
Some of our locations operate a recycling and energy waste reduction 
policy. Where possible we liaise with property owners and our clients to 
ensure that any recyclable waste from our operation – from waste paper 
to print and toner cartridges – is collected and recycled. Also, wherever 
possible, we ensure that lighting, heating and air conditioning meet energy 
conservation standards, and the non-core items or equipment are timed to 
switch off automatically.
Carbon emissions are produced as a result of the consumption of electricity, 
gas and transport usage. Key factors in minimising the generation of carbon 
emissions include the design, fabric and management of office premises to 
maximise energy efficiency.
Our people
We rely on our 4,300 employees to provide the high quality of service our 
customers and visitors expect. In return we work hard to look after our 
people. Our aim is to maximise and develop the skills of our staff, provide 
opportunities for personal development and achieve high rates of employee 
satisfaction.
Talent attraction and retention 
Regus has a reputation for attracting and retaining exceptional people 
– people who are success-orientated, spirited and driven to help others and 
themselves achieve more. 
Our people are at the heart of our business, so it is vital that they are  
trained to the highest competency. We provide a career path designed to 
allow individuals to achieve their very best within the Regus Group, whether 
they choose to stay in their region, or aspire to take advantage of our  
international locations.

Training and development 
Group policy is to provide opportunities for personal development at all 
levels in the organisation. We ensure that:
> Employees are provided with adequate and appropriate training to allow  
 them to fulfil their job description
> Appropriate opportunities and resources for the training and development 
 of employees are made to all staff 
> Employees are rewarded appropriately for improving their skills and  
 capabilities
> Training and development of employees is recorded and reviewed on at  
 least an annual basis as part of the performance management system.
Work/life balance
We promote a healthy lifestyle and where possible encourage a healthy 
work/life balance. We recognise that the health and welfare of our team 
members is important to the effectiveness of the business and the need 
for employees to maintain a healthy work/life balance is encouraged. In our 
centres we operate flexible working practices which give us the edge in  
retaining experienced and well trained staff and allows us to align our team 
members’ hours to the evolving needs of the business and our customer

Turning SMARTideas into reality
Via SMARTideas
©
 – Regus suggestion scheme, our team members  
are encouraged to submit ideas that enhance the way we do business. 
Suggestions can be made on any area of the business. The potential of 
each idea is assessed, many are developed into projects, and the most  
innovative ones are rewarded with prizes. 
Communication
The Company is committed to enhancing two-way communication through 
the process of team meetings, which our managers will hold on a regular 
basis. Through team meetings and information cascaded down from the 
senior team, employees are encouraged to feed back comments and  
opinions through their manager on any aspect of the business.
Information about the business
Our team members value communication. Each month our regional  
CEOs distribute “Focus” – an ezine, which covers regional performance, 
achievements and priorities. In addition, on a quarterly basis the Group 
Chief Executive, Mark Dixon emails to each team member a copy of  
“In Touch” – an ezine which summarises the latest news from around the 
world. The content – although varied month on month includes inter alia 
team member recognition of great customer service, VIP visitors to the 
Regus Group and new location openings.
Pages of information at our people’s fingertips
The Regus Group’s intranet, SMART, has been designed to ensure that 
every team member can instantly access a wealth of information, 24/7, 
that helps them to serve our clients to the best of their ability. With content 
tailored to a team member’s region and function, SMART is an integral tool 
to our open communications strategy. It is updated, round the clock, by 
dedicated Helpdesk Team, with each member logging in at least once  
every working day.
Regus Report & Accounts 2006 20
We recognise that the health  
and welfare of our team 
members is important. Health and safety
Regus is committed to maintaining a secure health and safety working 
environment and accepts no compromise on health and safety issues. This 
is not only driven by legal responsibility, but also by the ethical desire to 
protect employees, customers and visitors.
The Company has developed a Health and Safety Manual that sets out the 
obligations of team members to ensure a safe working environment for our 
team members and clients. A breach of the Health and Safety Manual will 
result in disciplinary action.
Under the health and safety frame work, local management must have 
suitable procedures in place to ensure compliance with applicable laws and 
regulations and, wherever possible employ best practice. 
The Company is required to ensure that sufficient team members are 
trained as first aiders and fire wardens. They are volunteers and undergo 
regular training. 
We are proactive in our approach to health and safety by monitoring  
proposed changes in legislation and implementing policies accordingly.
Customers
Our customers are our business. In order to maintain high levels of customer 
satisfaction we are constantly assessing the views of our customers through 
customer service questionnaires and exit interviews. All our centres are 
monitored and targeted on the levels of customer satisfaction and the levels 
of satisfaction have remained high over the last few years.
In addition we conduct mystery shopping which has helped increase the 
likelihood of repeat purchases and recommendations.
Business partners
We promote long term relationships with our business partners and our  
operations work closely with suppliers to maintain the integrity and continuity 
of service expected by our customers. 
Regus UK have been working on a robust approach to managing ethical 
and environmental standards in the supply chain. As a result, Regus UK 
only work with certified suppliers. A reasonable expectation would be to 
integrate these standards into our global procurement processes over the 
next two years. Initial concentration will be on major suppliers, areas of high 
risk and renewed/new contracts.
Communities and charities
Notwithstanding the international nature of the business, Regus around the 
world continues to operate with a high degree of autonomy. We recognise our 
responsibility to invest in the communities in which our business operates 
and to act as a good corporate citizen. The Group supports charities relevant 
to the countries and to the locations in which its business operate. These 
charities are wide-ranging and cover health, welfare, education, civic and 
community projects as well as culture and the arts.

At 31 December 2006, the Board of directors was made up  
of seven members comprising the Chairman, three executive 
directors and three non-executive directors. Biographical details 
of the directors are set out on pages 14 and 15. 
Role of the Board
The primary role of the Board is to provide entrepreneurial  
leadership and to review the overall strategic development of 
the Group. The Board approves the corporate plan and the  
annual budget and reviews performance against targets at every 
meeting. Through the Audit Committee, the directors ensure 
the integrity of financial information and the effectiveness of 
financial controls and the internal control and risk management 
system. The Board has delegated authority to the Remuneration 
Committee to set the remuneration policy for directors and  
senior management. The Nomination Committee recommends 
the appointment of Board directors and has responsibility  
for succession planning at Board level. The various Board 
Committees have authority to make decisions in their areas  
of expertise. 
Frequency of meetings
There were nine scheduled Board meetings during 2006.
The number of meetings of the Board and Committees and 
individual attendance by the directors are shown below.

Matters reserved for the Board
The Board has a formal schedule of matters reserved to it for 
its decision, to ensure that no one individual has unfettered 
powers of decision. These include:
> Approval of regulatory announcements including the interim  
 and annual financial statements
> Terms of reference and membership of the Board and  
 its Committees
> Changes to the Group’s capital structure
> Changes to the Group’s management and control structure
> Capital investment in excess of £1 million
> Material contracts (annual value in excess of £5 million).
Minutes are taken of all Board discussions and decisions and all 
directors are encouraged to request inclusion of any unresolved 
concerns that they may have in the Board minutes. 
Roles of Board members
There is a clear division of responsibilities between the Chairman 
and the Chief Executive. 
The Chairman
John Matthews is responsible for leadership of the Board, 
setting its agenda and monitoring its effectiveness. He ensures 
effective communication with shareholders and that the Board 
is aware of the views of major shareholders. He facilitates both 
the contribution of the non-executive directors and constructive 
relations between the executive directors and non-executive 
directors. 
The Chairman, together with the Company Secretary, are 
responsible for ensuring all directors are properly briefed on 
issues arising at Board meetings and that they have full and 
timely access to relevant information. 
The Chairman is not deemed to be independent because he 
has been a non-executive director for more than ten years. 
The Chief Executive
Mark Dixon is responsible for formulating strategy and for its 
delivery once agreed by the Board. He creates a framework  
of strategy, values, organisation and objectives to ensure the 
successful delivery of key targets, and allocates decision- 
making and responsibilities accordingly. 
Non-executive directors
The non-executive directors each bring their own senior level 
of experience and objectivity to the Board. The independent 
counsel brought to the Group by the non-executives enhances 
the overall decision making of the Board. Non-executives are 
appointed for an initial three year term, subject to election by 
shareholders at the first AGM after their appointment.  
The Board consider the non-executive directors to be  
independent. The senior independent director and Chairman 
of the Audit Committee, Roger Orf has served on the Board for 
over eight years. His ongoing independence will be reviewed in 
accordance with the Code later this year.  
Company Secretary 
The Company Secretary, Tim Regan, is responsible for advising 
the Board, through the Chairman, on all governance matters 
and for ensuring that appropriate minutes are taken of all Board 
meetings and discussions. The appointment and removal of the 
Company Secretary is a matter reserved for the Board.
Board Committees
The Board has delegated certain of its governance  
responsibilities to the Audit, Nomination and Remuneration  
Committees. The Company Secretary acts as secretary  
to all of the Board Committees and minutes of meetings  
are circulated to all Board members. 
Regus Report & Accounts 2006 22 The terms of reference of these committees have been  
documented and approved by the Board and are available on 
the Company’s website www.regus.com. A brief summary of 
the members, activities and terms of reference of the Board 
Committees is provided below. 
Audit Committee
Roger Orf (Chairman)
Stephen East 
Martin Robinson 
The Board has delegated the responsibility for applying an 
effective system of internal control and compliance, accurate 
external financial reporting, fulfilling its obligations under law 
and the Combined Code, and managing the relationship with 
the Company’s external auditors to the Audit Committee. The 
Committee consists entirely of non-executive directors.
The Audit Committee meets at least three times a year.  
At the request of the Chairman, the external auditors, the  
executive directors, the Company Secretary and the Head  
of Internal Audit attend each meeting.
Summary terms of reference
> Financial Reporting – provide support to the Board by  
 monitoring the integrity of and ensuring that the published  
 financial statements of the Group and any formal  
 announcements relating to the Company’s financial  
 performance comply fully with the relevant statutes and  
 accounting standards. 
> Internal control and risk systems – review the  
 effectiveness of the Group’s internal controls and risk  
 management systems.
> Internal audit – monitor and review the annual internal  
 audit programme ensuring that the internal audit function  
 is adequately resourced and free from management  
 restrictions, review and monitor responses to the findings  
 and recommendations of the internal auditors. 
> External audit – advise the Board on the appointment,  
 re-appointment, remuneration and removal of the external  
 auditors. 
> Employee concerns – review the Company’s arrangements 
 under which employees may in confidence raise any concerns 
 regarding possible wrongdoing in financial reporting or other  
 matters. The Committee ensures that these arrangements  
 allow proportionate and independent investigation and  
 appropriate follow up action. 
The Committee also meets independently with the Company’s 
auditors and with the Head of Internal Audit to informally discuss 
matters of interest.
External auditors
KPMG Audit Plc were the Company’s auditors for the year 
ended 31 December 2006. For 2007, the Committee has  
recommended to the Board that a resolution to reappoint 
KPMG Audit Plc as the Company’s auditors be proposed at 
the AGM. The Committee will continue to keep under review 
the independence and objectivity of the external auditors, the 
effectiveness of the audit process and the rotation of the lead 
audit partner.
The scope and extent of non-audit work undertaken by the 
Company’s external auditor is monitored by and, above certain 
thresholds, requires prior approval from the Committee to 
ensure that the provision of non-audit services does not impair 
their independence or objectivity. During the year, KPMG  
performed due diligence work on certain acquisitions. KPMG is 
prohibited from providing services that would be considered to 
jeopardise their independence such as book keeping services, 
valuations and system design.

principal risks and uncertainties
There are a number of risks and uncertainties which could have 
an impact on the Group’s long term performance. The Group 
has a risk management structure in place designed to identify, 
manage and mitigate business risks. Risk assessment and 
evaluation is an essential part of the annual planning, budgeting 
and forecasting cycle. 
The directors have identified the following principal risks and 
uncertainties. These do not constitute all of the risks facing  
the Group. 
Economic downturn in significant markets
The Group has a significant proportion of its centres in the 
Americas (predominantly the USA) and UK. An economic 
downturn in these markets could adversely affect the Group’s 
operating revenues thereby reducing operating performance  
or, in an extreme downturn, resulting in operating losses. 
The Group has taken a number of actions to mitigate this risk:
> The Group has entered into performance based leases with  
 landlords where rent costs vary with revenues earned by  
 the centre. 
> Building lease contracts include break clauses at periodic  
 intervals to allow the Group to exit leases should they become 
 onerous. In cities with a number of centres this allows the  
 Group to stagger leases such that an orderly reduction in  
 exposure to the location may be facilitated. 
> The profile of clients in a centre is continually reviewed to  
 avoid undue reliance on a particular client or clients in a  
 particular industry group. 
Exposure to movements in property markets
A number of the Group’s lease contracts contain market rent 
review clauses. This means that the costs of these leases may 
vary as a result of external movements in the property market. 
In particular, in the UK lease contracts typically contain ‘upward 
only’ rent reviews which means that should open market rents 
decrease, then Regus could be exposed to paying higher than 
market rent in these locations. 
If the Group is unable to pass on increased rent costs to  
customers due to local property market conditions then this 
could result in reduced profitability or operating losses in  
these markets. 
Equally, for Group lease contracts without market rent review 
clauses, the Group may benefit by paying below market rent in 
a market with increasing open market rents. This may allow the 
Group to improve profitability if the movements in open market 
rents are passed on to clients. 
Exposure to movements in exchange rates
The Group has significant overseas operations whose businesses 
are generally conducted in the currency of the country in which 
they operate. The principal exposures of the Group are to the 
US dollar and the euro with approximately 39% of the Group’s  
revenues being attributable to the dollar and 19% to the euro 
respectively. 
Given that transactions generally take place in the functional 
currency of group companies, the Group’s exposure to  
transactional foreign exchange rate risk is limited. However,  
the translation to sterling of overseas profits and net assets 
will be affected by prevailing exchange rates. In the event that 
either the US dollar or euro were to significantly depreciate or 
appreciate against sterling, this would have an adverse or  
beneficial impact to the Group’s reported performance and 
position respectively.  
The financial risk management objectives and policies of the 
Company, together with an analysis of the exposure to such 
risks, as required by the Companies Act 1985 are set out in  
note 23 of the Accounts. Wherever possible, the Group attempts 
to create natural hedges against currency exposures through 
matching income and expense and assets and liabilities in the 
same currency. The Group does not hedge profit translation 
exposure since such hedges only have a temporary effect. 
internal controls
The Board has ultimate responsibility for maintaining a sound 
system of internal control and for periodically reviewing its  
effectiveness. 
In accordance with the guidance set out in the Turnbull Report 
“Internal Control: Guidance for Directors on the Combined 
Code”, an ongoing process has been established for identifying,  
managing and evaluating the risks faced by the Group. The 
Group’s system of internal controls is designed to:
> facilitate the effective and efficient response to risks which  
 might affect the achievement of the Group’s objectives
> safeguard assets from inappropriate use or from loss or fraud
> help ensure the quality of internal and external financial  
 reporting
> help ensure compliance with applicable laws and regulations.
No system of internal control can provide absolute assurance 
against material misstatement or loss. The Group’s system 
of controls helps to manage rather than eliminate the risk of 
failure to achieve business objectives, and can only provide 
reasonable assurance that potential problems will normally be 
prevented or will be detected in a timely manner for appropriate 
action.
Strategy and risk management
The Board conducts regular reviews of the Group’s strategic 
direction. Country and regional strategic objectives, quarterly 
plans and performance targets for 2007 have been set by the 
executive directors and are regularly reviewed by the main 
Board in the context of the Group’s overall objectives. 
There is an ongoing process for identifying, evaluating and 
managing the risks faced by the Group. Major business risks  
and their financial implications are appraised by the responsible 
executives as a part of the budget process and these are  
endorsed by regional management. Key risks are reported to 
the Board and the Audit Committee. The appropriateness  
of controls is considered by the executives, having regard to 
cost/benefit, materiality and the likelihood of risks crystallising. 
Key risks and actions to mitigate those risks are regularly  
considered by the Board and are formally reviewed and  
approved by the Board annually. 
Regus Report & Accounts 2006 24 Control environment
High standards of behaviour are demanded from staff at all 
levels in the Group. The following procedures are in place to 
support this:
> the induction process is used to educate new team members 
 on the standards required from them in their role, including  
 business ethics and compliance, regulations and internal  
 policies
> all team members are provided with a copy of the ‘Team  
 Member Handbook’ which contains detailed guidance on  
 employee policies and the standards of behaviour required  
 of staff
> policies and procedures manuals and guidelines are readily  
 accessible through the Group’s intranet site
> operational audit and self-certification tools which require  
 individual centre managers to confirm their adherence to  
 Group policies and procedures. 
To underpin the effectiveness of controls, it is the Group’s policy 
to recruit and develop appropriately skilled management and 
staff of high calibre, integrity and with appropriate disciplines. 
The Group has also established an externally hosted whistle-
blowing channel to all staff to report issues and concerns in 
confidence. 
Control processes
The Company has had procedures in place throughout the year 
and up to 19 March 2007, the date of approval of this Annual 
Report, which accord with the Internal Control Guidance for 
directors on the Combined Code. These include the following:
> The Board normally meets with regional executives every  
 six months together to carry out a wide-ranging review of  
 Group and regional financial performance, business  
 development opportunities, Group infrastructure and  
 general Group management issues. 
> The annual budget process is driven from senior management 
 meetings. Budgets are prepared at a detailed level by business 
 centre and roll-up at a country and regional level. The executive 
 directors review regional budgets to ensure consistency with  
 regional strategic objectives, and the final budget is reviewed  
 and approved by the Board. The approved budget forms the  
 basis of business management throughout the year. 
> Operational reports and financial reports are prepared and  
 distributed to the Board on a monthly basis. Actual results  
 are reviewed against budget and forecast and explanations  
 are received for all material movements. 
> Key policies and control procedures (including finance,  
 operations, and health and safety) are documented in  
 manuals having Group-wide application. These are available  
 to all staff on the Group’s intranet system.
> The Board has formal procedures in place for the review and  
 approval of investment and acquisition projects. The Group  
 Investment Committee (comprising the executive directors)  
 review all investments prior to approval by the Board.  
 Additionally the form and content of investment proposals  
 is standardised to facilitate the review process. 
> The Group has clearly delegated authority limits with regard  
 to the approval of transactions. Purchase orders must be  
 obtained in advance for all purchases in excess of £1,000. 
> Numerous reports are generated from the Group’s sales and  
 operating systems on a daily, weekly and monthly basis to  
 provide management at all levels with performance data for  
 their area of responsibility which helps them to focus on  
 operational issues that may require their input. 
Information and communications processes
The senior management team are integrally involved in the  
business and to this extent regularly discuss and address issues 
and opportunities with regional and functional teams. Formal 
business review meetings, chaired by Mark Dixon, are held with 
the regional teams and functional heads on a monthly basis.
Regular staff communications include general information on 
the business from senior management as well as operational 
guidance on changes in policies and procedures. 
Sales staff and operational management periodically attend 
sales or management conferences at which information on 
operational issues is shared. Additionally in 2006 a senior  
management conference provided a platform for sharing  
the Group’s overall strategy. Delegates presented the key  
messages to employees who did not attend the event. 
Monitoring effectiveness
The following key mechanisms were available to the Board at 
various times during the year in the conduct of its review of 
internal controls:
> Review of the Group’s monthly management accounts  
 which contain detailed analysis of financial performance  
 for the Group and each of the Group’s geographic reporting  
 segments. 
> An ongoing process of review, through Board meetings,  
 senior management meetings and divisional reviews as well  
 as other management meetings, for the formal identification  
 of significant operational risks and mitigating control  
 processes. 
> Internal audit reviews of key risk areas. The findings  
 and recommendations of each review are reported to  
 management and the Audit Committee.
> Quarterly post-investment reviews are presented to the  
 Audit Committee to allow appraisal of the effectiveness  
 of investment activity. 
> A bi-annual internal control self-assessment and  
 management certification exercise covering the effectiveness  
 of financial and operational controls. This is based on a  
 comprehensive internal control questionnaire collated and  
 reviewed by Internal Audit. Results and any necessary  
 mitigating action plans are presented to senior management  
 and the Board.
Other matters
Board performance evaluation
During 2006, a formal annual performance evaluation has been 
conducted in respect of the Board, its Committees and of each 
individual director by means of an internally produced written 
questionnaire. This required performance to be scored on a 
scale of 1 to 5 against a number of criteria with 1 representing
25 Regus Report & Accounts 2006 Corporate governance
continued
a need for urgent improvement in performance, 3 representing 
adequate performance and 5 representing excellent  
performance. 
The results of these evaluations were consolidated by the 
Chairman and presented to the Board for formal consideration.  
All criteria were scored as adequate or better and therefore  
no formal corrective actions have been initiated. The senior 
independent non-executive director reviewed the Chairman’s  
performance. 
Training and resources 
Appropriate training is made available for all new directors to 
assist them in the discharge of their responsibilities. Training is 
provided on an ongoing basis to meet particular needs with the 
emphasis on governance and accounting developments.  
During the year the Company Secretary, Tim Regan, provided 
updates to the Board on relevant governance matters, whilst 
the Audit Committee regularly considers new accounting  
developments through presentations from management, internal 
audit and the external auditors. The Board programme includes 
presentations from management at which, together with site 
visits, increases the non-executive directors understanding of 
the business and sector. 
All directors have access to the advice and services of the 
Company Secretary, who is responsible for ensuring that Board 
procedures, corporate governance and regulatory compliance 
are followed and complied with. Should a director request 
independent professional advice to carry out his duties, such 
advice is available to him at the Company’s expense.
Directors and officers insurance
The Group’s insurance programme is reviewed annually and 
appropriate insurance cover is obtained to protect the directors 
and senior management in the event of a claim being brought 
against any of them in their capacity as directors and officers of 
the Company.
Dialogue with shareholders
Regus reports formally to shareholders twice a year, with the 
interim results normally announced in September and the  
preliminary final results normally announced in March. There 
are programmes for the Chief Executive and Chief Financial  
Officer to give presentations of these results to the Company’s 
institutional investors, analysts and media in London and other 
locations. The Chief Executive and Chief Financial Officer  
maintain a close dialogue with institutional investors on the 
Company’s performance, governance, plans and objectives.  
These meetings also serve to develop an ongoing understanding 
of the views and any concerns of the Company’s major 
shareholders. The non-executive directors are given regular 
updates as to the views of the institutional shareholders and 
the Chairman is available to meet with these shareholders on 
request. The principal communication with private shareholders 
is through the Annual Report, the Interim Report and the AGM.
The Company has appointed Brunswick Group plc as their 
Investor Relations adviser.  
AGM
The AGM is held normally in May in London and is attended, 
other than in exceptional circumstances, by all members of  
the Board. In addition to the formal business of the meeting, 
there is normally a trading update and shareholders are invited 
to ask questions and are given the opportunity to meet the 
directors informally afterwards. 
Notice of the AGM, together with any related documents are 
mailed to shareholders at least 20 working days before the 
meeting and separate resolutions are proposed on each issue.  
The level of proxy votes cast and the balance for and against  
each resolution, together with the level of abstentions, if any, are 
announced to the meeting following voting by a show of hands.  
Financial and other information is made available on the  
Company’s website www.regus.com.
Re-election of the Board 
All directors submit themselves for re-election by shareholders 
at least every three years and directors appointed during the 
period are required to seek re-election at the next AGM.
Non-executive directors are subject to the re-election  
requirements and serve the Company under letters of  
appointment, which have an initial three year term.
Compliance statement
The Company has complied with the provisions set out in  
section 1 of the Combined Code throughout the year ended  
31 December 2005, with the exception of the following:
> Provision D.1.1 – The senior independent non-executive  
 director, Roger Orf does not have regular meetings with  
 major external shareholders. 
The Board considers it appropriate for the Chairman to be the 
main non-executive conduit for investors, rather than the senior 
independent non-executive director. The Chairman makes 
himself available for questions, in person, at the time of major 
announcements and may be contacted by investors at any 
time. The Chairman updates the Board and particularly the 
senior independent non-executive director on the results of his 
meetings and the opinions of investors. On this basis, Regus 
considers that the senior independent non-executive director is 
able to gain full awareness of the issues and concerns of major 
shareholders. Notwithstanding this policy, all directors have a 
standing invitation to participate in meetings with investors.
 
Regus Report & Accounts 2006 26 The report has been prepared by the Remuneration Committee 
(the “Committee”) of Regus Group plc and approved by the 
Board of directors of Regus Group plc. The report complies 
with the UK Directors’ Remuneration Report Regulations 2002 
and, in compliance with such regulations, a separate resolution  
approving this report is being put to shareholders at this  
years AGM. 
Information relating to the emoluments and pension contributions 
of the directors, directors’ interests in the Company’s shares 
and under Employee Share Plans has been audited. 
Unaudited information
Membership and responsibilities of the Committee 
The members of the Committee throughout the year were the 
Company’s independent non-executive directors, Roger Orf, 
Stephen East and, the Chairman of the Committee, Martin 
Robinson.
The Committee met five times during the year.
The Committee has responsibility for making recommendations 
to the Board on the compensation of senior executives and 
determining, within agreed terms of reference, the specific 
remuneration packages for each of the executive directors.
The Board has delegated to the Committee responsibility to:
> Make recommendations to the Board in respect of  
 remuneration policy for the executive directors and the  
 Group’s other senior management.
> Approve any new service agreement entered into between  
 the Group and any executive director.
> Make recommendations to the Board on the implementation 
 of the Group’s performance bonus schemes and share  
 schemes.
The Committee receives advice on executive remuneration from 
Halliwell Consulting, an external consultancy which has wide 
experience of executive remuneration in UK listed companies. 
Halliwell Consulting has no other connection with the Company.  
Directors are not permitted, under Regus Group plc’s Articles 
of Association, to vote on their own terms and conditions of 
remuneration. 
The Committee’s terms of reference are available on the  
Company’s website, www.regus.com. The members of the 
Remuneration Committee attend the Company’s AGM and  
are available to answer shareholders’ questions about directors’ 
remuneration. 
Compliance with the best practice provisions
In accordance with the Board’s commitment to maintaining 
high standards of Corporate Governance, the Committee has 
complied with all remuneration related aspects of the Code 
during the year. 
Remuneration policy 
The principal objective of the Committee’s remuneration policy 
is to provide remuneration packages that will attract, retain and 
motivate people of the highest calibre and experience needed 
to shape and execute the Company’s strategy and to deliver 
shareholder value. 
The guiding principles which the Committee has regard to and 
balances, as far as is practicable, in determining policy and 
objectives for 2006 and future years are:
> to ensure that it maintains a competitive package of total  
 compensation, commensurate with comparable packages  
 available with other similar companies operating in similar  
 markets. For 2006, compensation was benchmarked against 
 a group of 22 UK and US quoted companies with similar  
 corporate attributes to the Company. For the UK quoted  
 companies, these were drawn from the commercial services, 
 support services and real estate management services  
 industrial sectors. US companies were selected from the  
 commercial services and real estate services sector  
 (the Comparator Group);
> to make a significant percentage of potential maximum  
 reward conditional on short and long term performance;
> to ensure that the interests of the executives are closely  
 aligned with those of the Company’s shareholders through  
 the provision of share incentives;
> to link reward to the satisfaction of targeted objectives which  
 are the main drivers of shareholder value; and
> to be sensitive in determining executive directors’  
 remuneration to pay and employment conditions around  
 the Group.
In order to achieve the above policy, the Committee sets the 
fixed elements of the executives’ compensation package at  
a conservative level, taking into account the median level of 
salaries in the Comparator Group. This is balanced with the  
opportunity for overall compensation packages to be in the  
upper quartile of the Comparator Group dependent upon  
the degree to which the associated stringent performance  
conditions attached to the short and long term incentive 
schemes have been satisfied.
The table below illustrates the balance between fixed and 
performance related (variable) compensation and the total 
expected value of the remuneration package for each executive 
director for the year ended 31 December 2006:

continued
Balance between fixed and performance based
compensation (£m)
Fixed compensation comprises salary, benefits and pension 
contributions. Variable compensation comprises the annual 
bonus paid in relation to the year ended 31 December 2006 
and the fair value of the Regus Group plc Co-Investment Plan 
(the “CIP”) Awards granted in March 2006.
The main elements of these packages and the performance 
conditions are described below. 
The Committee will continue to review the policy on an annual 
basis to ensure that it is in line with the Company’s objectives 
and shareholders’ interests.
Non-executive directors are remunerated with fees, set at  
levels that are sufficient to attract and retain their services and 
are in line with market rates. The non-executive directors do not 
receive any pension or other benefits, other than appropriate 
expenses, nor do they participate in any bonus or share option 
schemes.
Martin Robinson, Stephen East and Roger Orf have chosen 
until further notice to use the whole of their directors’ fees  
(net of tax) to purchase Regus shares in the open market on a  
quarterly basis. In addition, John Matthews has chosen to use 
part of his fees to purchase Regus shares in the open market.

Remuneration packages 
The remuneration for executive directors during the year  
comprised a basic salary, a benefit package, an annual  
performance based short term incentive award paid partly in 
cash and partly in shares and participation in the Company’s 
share incentive arrangement, the CIP. 
Basic salary and benefits 
When determining the salaries of the executive directors, the 
Committee takes into consideration:
> the levels of base salary for similar positions prevailing in  
 the employment market generally for executive directors  
 of companies of comparable status and market value, in  
 particular the median salary levels of the those companies  
 within the Comparator Group;
> the performance of the individual executive director;
> the performance of the Company;
> the individual executive director’s experience and  
 responsibilities; and
> pay and conditions throughout the Company.
Basic salaries are reviewed annually and any increases are  
effective from 1 January.
The salaries of the Chief Executive, Chief Operating Officer  
and Chief Financial Officer will be £509,215, £273,500 and 
£250,000 respectively effective from 1 January 2007. This 
equates to an increase of 8% for each executive director based 
on their salaries as at 31 December 2006. It is the opinion  
of the Committee that such rises were necessary to reflect  
the performance of the individuals and to ensure that their  
respective salaries remain at a competitive level. 
Benefits comprise a company car or allowance, fuel, private 
medical insurance and a living allowance for the Chief Executive.
Annual bonus scheme
Overview
The Committee believes firmly in the financial effectiveness 
of short term incentives. Accordingly, every employee in the 
Group participates in some form of incentive scheme. 
As for 2005, maximum individual bonuses payable to executive 
directors and senior management were capped at 100% of 
basic annual salary of which a maximum 50% could be taken 
as cash and 50% deferred to purchase shares (“Investment 
Shares”) in Regus Group plc. These shares are awarded under 
the CIP with the opportunity to receive an additional award of 
shares (“Matching Shares”) after a three year period subject to 
certain conditions. 
For the year ended 31 December 2006, the executive  
directors satisfied the stretching EBIT targets in full. As such  
the total bonus payable will be 100% of salary. In reporting  
the calculation of awards, the Committee is mindful of the  
commercial sensitivity of the structure of the Group’s bonus  
arrangements and considers that more detailed disclosure is 
inappropriate in the circumstances. As stated above 50% of  
the total bonus payable will be paid in cash and 50% will be 
used to purchase Investment Shares. However at the time of

Regus Report & Accounts 2006 28 the drafting of this report the award of Investment Shares and  
associated Matching Shares has not been made due to the 
Company being in a close period. The Committee will provide 
full details of the award and relevant performance conditions in 
its Remuneration Report for the year ending 31 December 2007. 
The maximum number of awards granted to the executive 
directors will be based on the price of an ordinary share at the 
time of the grant and the monetary value will not exceed 50% 
of the total bonus paid.
Bonus targets are reviewed and agreed by the Committee  
at the beginning of each financial year. The performance  
measures for the bonus are reviewed annually by the Committee 
to ensure that they are appropriate to the current market  
conditions and position of the Company and to confirm that 
they remain challenging. The structure of the bonus targets 
for the year ending 31 December 2007 will be similar to those 
operated for 2006.
The maximum bonus potential available for the executive  
directors for the year ending 31 December 2007 will be  
increased to 125% of basic annual salary. The rationale for  
this increase is to ensure that:
> short term available remuneration is competitive against  
 the Comparator Group given the policy of setting executive  
 salaries at or below the median; and
> a greater element of the executive’s remuneration is  
 performance-related. 
Although the bonus targets for 2007 are similar to those operating 
in 2006, the Committee has increased the level of performance 
which must be achieved against for full bonus-payout. As such, 
the Committee will continue to ordinarily cap the bonus at 
100% of base salary and will only pay any part of the additional 
bonus (which in any event will not attract any Matching Shares) 
of up to 25% in the event of a substantial over-performance 
against the 2007 EBIT budget.  
Bonuses are non-pensionable. 
Non-executive directors do not receive a bonus. 
Pension benefits
The executive directors participate in the Company’s Money 
Purchase (Personal Pension) Scheme. The Company matches 
contributions up to a maximum of 7% of basic salary. The 
Committee considers that the pension benefits of the executive 
directors are low compared with comparative companies but 
prefers to offer an enhanced variable short term bonus to  
compensate (rather than a fixed additional pension contribution).
The Group does not operate a defined benefit pension scheme 
and has no plans to introduce such a scheme.
Long term incentives
Overview
The Committee continues to believe that the interests of  
shareholders and executives are aligned through the long term 
incentive policy, the CIP, which was approved by shareholders at 
the 2005 AGM. The Committee will not grant any further awards 
under the Company’s existing arrangements to executives who
participate in the CIP, although it does intend to grant options 
in the future on an ad hoc basis under the Regus Group Share 
Option Scheme to certain non-participants in the CIP.
The Committee views the CIP, introduced in 2005, as the  
most appropriate vehicle for long term incentivisation for the 
executive directors and other senior executives. Details of the 
awards made to executive directors during the year are set  
out below.
There are two elements to the CIP:
The first element operates in conjunction with the annual  
bonus whereby 50% of any gross bonus payment will be  
paid in cash, with the other 50% taken as a deferred award  
of shares to be released at the end of a three year period. 
Matching Shares will be awarded linked to the number of  
Investment Shares awarded and will vest depending on the 
Company’s growth in free cash flow per share (FCF), EPS 
targets and relative total shareholder return (TSR) measured 
against the FTSE 350 Support Services Index. Matching 
Shares are awarded at no cost to participants.
The maximum number of Matching Shares which can be 
awarded to a participant in the CIP is 200% of salary. As  
such the maximum number of Matching Shares which can  
be awarded based on Investment Shares awarded is 4:1. 
However, this level of award is subject to full payout of the  
annual bonus. In order to ensure that the executive directors 
and senior executives are motivated to consistently perform on 
an annual basis, the maximum matching ratio will only apply to 
participants who receive a bonus payout of 50% of salary or 
more. For bonus payout of less than 50% of salary the matching 
participants will only be eligible to receive two Matching Shares 
to one Investment Share. 
Grants during the year ending 31 December 2006

(a)
  £618,350 £326,012
Fair value of CIP Award as

(a) The fair value was calculated by taking the face value of the shares on the  
 date of award and discounting this value by the probability of the performance 
 condition being satisfied at this date (in accordance with the principles of IFRS 2).
The second element is that the Committee may also make stand 
alone whole share awards (“LTIP Awards”) without reference to 
annual bonus, up to a maximum of 100% of salary per annum 
under the CIP. Under the LTIP Award is a conditional right over 
a whole number of shares with the release being dependent  
on the extent to which (if at all) the challenging performance 
conditions set by the Committee at the time the LTIP Award is 
made are satisfied. 
No LTIP Award was made in 2006.
29 Regus Report & Accounts 2006 Remuneration report
continued
It is unlikely that future stand-alone LTIP Awards will be made 
to existing executive directors unless there are exceptional 
circumstances. 
The performance conditions for the grant of awards under the 
CIP in 2006 and LTIP in 2005 are set out in the following table:
  Adjusted EPS (p) for the year ending 31 December 2008
  11p 12p 13p 14p
Growth in FCF
per share
10% 6% 13% 19% 25%
15% 13% 25% 38% 50%
20% 19% 38% 56% 75%
25% 25% 50% 75% 100%
In addition, no awards will be released unless the Company’s 
TSR is at least at the median when compared against that of 
the companies comprising the FTSE 350 Support Services 
Sector at the date of grant. 
The adjusted EPS target is derived from basic EPS adjusted to 
take into account factors such as:
> in a growth company such as Regus, costs are necessarily 
 incurred in one year to drive profits in future years. As such  
 it is important to ensure management is not incentivised to 
 cut back on these investments to meet EPS targets in any  
 one year. Accordingly those costs, incurred in the vesting  
 year, which it considers necessary to drive future growth will  
 be excluded from the EPS calculation. These would include,  
 inter alia, the costs of the business development departments, 
 excess marketing expenditures and current year losses from  
 investing in new locations.
> any one-off or exceptional costs will be excluded; and
> it is expected that in the period between 2006 and 2008 the  
 cash tax rate will rise as cumulative tax losses are utilised  
 thereby increasing progressively the challenge of achieving 
 a 14p EPS target. This will then be further complicated by  
 the need to recognise deferred tax assets as the business  
 strengthens reducing the accounting rate of tax in one year  
 and increasing it in the next. To provide greater clarity and  
 incentive to management EPS will be calculated based upon  
 a maximum cash tax rate of 30%.
The Committee will retain the discretion to take into account 
other factors in its determination of adjustment EPS. However, 
when exercising its discretion the Committee will ensure that 
the adjustments are made to reflect the underlying real earnings 
of the Company and not for the benefit of the executive directors. 
The Committee is of the opinion that the adjusted EPS and free 
cash flow performance targets are a transparent and accurate 
measure of the Company’s performance at this time and are 
the key corporate metrics for driving long term shareholder 
value. In addition, the TSR condition will ensure that executives 
are encouraged to focus on ensuring that the Company’s 
return to shareholders is competitive compared to comparable 
companies.  
As mentioned above, awards under the CIP in respect of  
the bonus paid for the year ended 31 December 2006 will be  
made subsequent to the publication of this report. However the 
maximum number of awards granted to the executive directors 
will be based on the price of an ordinary share at the time of 
grant and the monetary value will not exceed 50% of basic  
salary. Full details of the levels of award and performance 
conditions will be disclosed in the Committee’s Remuneration 
Report for the year ending 31 December 2007.
Details of share options granted to executive directors prior to 
the introduction of the CIP are set out in the audited section of 
this report.
External appointments
Executive directors are permitted to accept appointments 
on external boards or committees so long as these are not 
deemed to interfere with the business of the Group. Any fees 
received in respect of these appointments are retained directly 
by the relevant executive director. At 31 December 2006, the 
executive directors did not hold any external positions for which 
they receive fees.
TSR
The graph below shows the Company’s performance,  
measured by TSR for the Group compared with the performance 
of the FTSE 250 Index and the FTSE 350 Support Services Index. 
The Committee consider the FTSE 250 Index relevant since it 
is an index of companies of similar size to Regus Group plc. As 
detailed earlier in the report the Company considers its TSR 
performance for share awards under the CIP in comparison to 
that of the FTSE 350 Support Services Index.

33 Regus Report & Accounts 2006 Director statements
Statement of directors’ responsibilities in respect of the 
annual Report and financial statements
The directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report 
and the Group and parent company financial statements in  
accordance with applicable law and regulations. 
Company law requires the directors to prepare Group and  
parent company financial statements for each financial year. 
Under that law they are required to prepare the Group financial 
statements in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the EU 
and applicable law and have elected to prepare the parent 
company financial statements in accordance with UK Accounting 
Standards and applicable law. 
The Group financial statements are required by law and IFRSs 
as adopted by the EU to present fairly the financial position and 
performance of the Group; the Companies Act 1985 provides 
in relation to such financial statements that references in the  
relevant part of that Act to financial statements giving a true and 
fair view are references to their achieving a fair presentation.  
The parent company financial statements are required by law 
to give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the parent 
company.  
In preparing each of the Group and parent company financial 
statements, the directors are required to: 
> Select suitable accounting policies and then apply them  
 consistently;
> Make judgments and estimates that are reasonable and  
 prudent;
> For the Group financial statements, state whether they have  
 been prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by  
 the EU;
> For the parent company financial statements, state whether  
 applicable UK accounting standards have been followed,  
 subject to any material departures disclosed and explained  
 in the parent company financial statements; and
> Prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis  
 unless it is inappropriate to presume that the Company and  
 Group will continue in business.
The directors are responsible for keeping proper accounting 
records that disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the 
financial position of the parent company and to enable them to 
ensure that its financial statements comply with the Companies 
Act 1985. They have general responsibility for taking such steps 
as are reasonably open to them to safeguard the assets of the 
Group and to prevent and detect fraud and other irregularities. 
Under applicable law and regulations, the directors are also 
responsible for preparing a Directors’ Report, a Remuneration 
Report and Corporate Governance Statement that comply with 
that law and those regulations. 
The directors are responsible for the maintenance and  
integrity of the corporate and financial information included on 
the Company’s website. Legislation in the UK governing the 
preparation and dissemination of financial statements may  
differ from legislation in other jurisdictions.
Statutory statement as to disclosure to auditors
The directors who held office at the date of approval of this 
Directors’ Report confirm that, so far as they are aware, there is 
no relevant audit information of which the Company’s auditors 
are unaware; and each director has taken all the steps that they 
ought to have taken as a director to make themselves aware  
of any relevant audit information and to establish that the  
Company’s auditors are aware of that information. 
Regus Report & Accounts 2006 34 We have audited the Group and parent company financial 
statements (the “financial statements”) of Regus Group plc  
for the year ended 31 December 2006 which comprise the 
Consolidated Income Statement, the Consolidated and Parent 
Company Balance Sheets, the Consolidated Cash Flow  
Statement, the Consolidated Statement of Changes in Equity 
and the related notes. These financial statements have been 
prepared under the accounting policies set out therein. We have 
also audited the information in the directors’ Remuneration 
Report that is described as having been audited.
This report is made solely to the Company’s members, as 
a body, in accordance with section 235 of the Companies 
Act 1985. Our audit work has been undertaken so that we 
might state to the Company’s members those matters we are 
required to state to them in an auditor’s report and for no other 
purpose. To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not  
accept or assume responsibility to anyone other than the  
Company and the Company’s members as a body, for our 
audit work, for this report, or for the opinions we have formed.
Respective responsibilities of directors and auditors
The directors’ responsibilities for preparing the Annual  
Report and the Group financial statements in accordance with 
applicable law and International Financial Reporting Standards 
(IFRSs) as adopted by the EU, and for preparing the parent 
company financial statements and the directors’ Remuneration 
Report in accordance with applicable law and UK Accounting 
Standards (UK Generally Accepted Accounting Practice) are set 
out in the Statement of Directors’ Responsibilities on page 34.
Our responsibility is to audit the financial statements and the 
part of the directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited in 
accordance with relevant legal and regulatory requirements and 
International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland).
We report to you our opinion as to whether the financial  
statements give a true and fair view and whether the financial 
statements and the part of the directors’ Remuneration Report 
to be audited have been properly prepared in accordance with 
the Companies Act 1985 and, as regards the Group financial 
statements, Article 4 of the IAS Regulation. We also report to you 
whether in our opinion the information given in the Directors’ 
Report is consistent with the financial statements. The information 
given in the Directors’ Report includes that specific information 
presented in the Chief Executive’s Review, the Financial Review 
and the Corporate Responsibility Report that is cross referenced 
from the business review section of the Directors’ Report. We  
also report to you if, in our opinion, the Company has not kept 
proper accounting records, if we have not received all the  
information and explanations we require for our audit, or if  
information specified by law regarding directors’ remuneration 
and other transactions is not disclosed.
We review whether the Corporate Governance Statement  
reflects the Company’s compliance with the nine provisions  
of the 2003 Financial Reporting Council Combined Code  
specified for our review by the Listing Rules of the Financial 
Services Authority, and we report if it does not. We are not  
required to consider whether the Board’s statements on internal 
control cover all risks and controls, or form an opinion on the 
effectiveness of the Group’s corporate governance procedures 
or its risk and control procedures.
We read the other information contained in the Annual Report 
and consider whether it is consistent with the audited financial 
statements. We consider the implications for our report if  
we become aware of any apparent misstatements or material  
inconsistencies with the financial statements. Our responsibilities 
do not extend to any other information.
Basis of audit opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with International 
Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland) issued by the Auditing 
Practices Board. An audit includes examination, on a test basis, 
of evidence relevant to the amounts and disclosures in the  
financial statements and the part of the directors’ Remuneration 
Report to be audited. It also includes an assessment of the 
significant estimates and judgements made by the directors  
in the preparation of the financial statements, and of whether 
the accounting policies are appropriate to the Group’s and 
Company’s circumstances, consistently applied and adequately 
disclosed.
We planned and performed our audit so as to obtain all the  
information and explanations which we considered necessary in 
order to provide us with sufficient evidence to give reasonable 
assurance that the financial statements and the part of the  
directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited are free from 
material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or other  
irregularity or error. In forming our opinion we also evaluated 
the overall adequacy of the presentation of information in the 
financial statements and the part of the directors’ Remuneration 
Report to be audited.
Opinion
In our opinion:
> the Group financial statements give a true and fair view,  
 in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the EU, of the state  
 of the Group’s affairs as at 31 December 2006 and of its  
 profit for the year then ended;
> the Group financial statements have been properly prepared  
 in accordance with the Companies Act 1985 and Article 4 of  
 the IAS Regulation;
> the parent company financial statements give a true and  
 fair view, in accordance with UK Generally Accepted  
 Accounting Practice, of the state of the parent company’s  
 affairs as at 31 December;
> the parent company financial statements and the part of the  
 directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited have been  
 properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act  
 1985; and
> the information given in the Directors’ Report is consistent  
 with the financial statements.

39 Regus Report	&	Accounts	2006 1 Authorisation of financial statements
The	 Group	 and	 Company	 financial	 statements	 for	 the	 year	 ended	 	 31	December	2006	were	authorised	for	issue	by	the	Board	of	directors 	 on	19	March	2007	and	the	balance	sheets	were	signed	on	the	Board’s 	 behalf	by	Mark	Dixon	and	Stephen	Gleadle.	Regus	Group	plc	is	a	public	 limited	company	incorporated	and	domiciled	in	England	and	Wales.	The	 Company’s	ordinary	shares	are	traded	on	the	London	Stock	Exchange.
The	Group	financial	statements	have	been	prepared	and	approved	by	the	 directors	in	accordance	with	International	Financial	Reporting	Standards	 as	adopted	by	the	EU	(“Adopted	IFRSs”).	The	Company	has	elected	to	 prepare	its	parent	company	financial	statements	in	accordance	with	UK	 GAAP;	these	are	presented	on	pages	69	to	70.
2 Accounting policies
Basis of preparation
The	Group	financial	statements	consolidate	those	of	the	Company	and	 its	subsidiaries	(together	referred	to	as	the	“Group”)	and	equity	account	 the	 Group’s	 interest	 in	 associates	 and	 jointly	 controlled	 entities.	 The	 parent	 company	 financial	 statements	 present	 information	 about	 the	 Company	 	 as	a	separate	entity	and	not	about	its	Group.
The	 accounting	 policies	 set	 out	 below	 have,	 unless	 otherwise	 stated,	 been	 applied	 consistently	 to	 all	 periods	 presented	 in	 these	 Group	 	 financial	 statements.	 Amendments	 to	 adopted	 IFRSs	 issued	 by	 	 International	Accounting	Standards	Board	(IASB)	and	the	International	 Financial	Reporting	Interpretations	Committee	(IFRIC)	with	an	effective	 date	from	1	January	2006	did	not	have	a	material	effect	on	the	Group	 financial	statements.
In	addition,	in	order	to	provide	more	detailed	disclosures	the	Group	has	 made	 certain	 presentational	 changes	 to	 the	 financial	 statements	 for	 	 2006	and	has	restated	the	comparative	information	for	2005	so	that	the	 accounts	are	presented	on	a	comparative	basis.	 The	following	changes	have	been	made:
>	 £0.7	million	relating	to	the	share	of	net	assets	of	joint	ventures	has	 	 	 been	reclassified	from	provision	for	deficits	in	joint	ventures	to	assets; 	 >	 £11.8	million	relating	to	long	term	assets,	principally	landlord	deposits,	 	 	 have	been	reclassified	from	current	assets.
Judgements	 made	 by	 the	 directors	 in	 the	 application	 of	 these	 accounting	 policies	 that	 have	 significant	 effect	 on	 the	 financial	 statements	 and	 	 estimates	with	a	significant	risk	of	material	adjustment	in	the	next	year	 are	discussed	in	note	31.
The	financial	statements	are	prepared	on	a	historical	cost	basis,	with	the	 exception	of	certain	financial	assets	and	liabilities	that	are	measured	at	 fair	value.
The	Group	and	Company	financial	statements	are	presented	in	pounds	 sterling	 and	 all	 values	 are	 in	 million	 pounds,	 rounded	 to	 one	 decimal	 place,	except	where	indicated	otherwise.
Adopted IFRSs not yet applied
The	following	adopted	IFRSs	were	available	for	early	application	but	have	 not	been	applied	by	the	Group	in	these	financial	statements:
IFRS	 7	 “Financial	 Instruments:	 Disclosure”	 applicable	 for	 accounting	 	 periods	 commencing	 on	 or	 after	 1	 January	 2007.	 The	 impact	 on	 the	 Group’s	 financial	 statements	 on	 the	 initial	 application	 of	 this	 Standard	 	 is	not	expected	to	be	significant.
IAS	 1	 Amendment	 “Presentation	 of	 Financial	 Statements:	 Capital	 	 Disclosures”	applicable	for	accounting	periods	commencing	on	or	after	 1	January	2007.	The	impact	of	this	Amendment	on	the	Group’s	financial	 statements	is	not	expected	to	be	significant.
Basis of consolidation
Subsidiaries	are	entities	controlled	by	the	Group.	Control	exists	when	 	 the	 Group	 has	 the	 power,	 directly	 or	 indirectly,	 to	 govern	 the	 financial	 and	 operating	policies	of	an	entity	so	as	to	obtain	benefits	from	its	activities.	 In	 assessing	 control,	 potential	 voting	 rights	 that	 are	 currently	 exercisable	 or	 convertible	 are	 taken	 into	 account.	 The	 financial	 statements	 of	 	 subsidiaries	 are	 included	 in	 the	 consolidated	 financial	 statements	 from	 the	date	that	control	commences.	The	results	are	consolidated	until	the	 date	 control	 ceases	 or	 the	 subsidiary	 qualifies	 as	 a	 discontinued	 operation	 or	disposal	group	at	which	point	the	assets	and	liabilities	are	carried	at	 fair	value.
The	 attributable	 results	 of	 those	 companies	 acquired	 or	 disposed	 of	 	 during	the	year	are	included	for	the	periods	of	ownership.
Associates	are	those	entities	in	which	the	Group	has	significant	influence,	 but	 not	 control,	 over	 the	 financial	 and	 operating	 policies.	 The	 consolidated	 financial	 statements	 include	 the	 Group’s	 share	 of	 the	 total	 recognised	 	 income	and	expense	of	associates	on	an	equity	accounted	basis,	from	 the	 date	 that	 significant	 influence	 commences	 until	 the	 date	 that	 significant	 influence	 ceases	 or	 the	 associate	 qualifies	 as	 a	 discontinued	 operation	 or	 disposal	 group	 at	 which	 point	 the	 investment	 is	 carried	 at	 fair	 value.	 When	 the	 Group’s	 share	 of	 losses	 exceeds	 its	 interest	 in	 an	 associate,	 the	 Group’s	 carrying	 amount	 is	 reduced	 to	 nil	 and	 recognition	 of	 further	 losses	 is	 discontinued	 except	 to	 the	 extent	 that	 the	 Group	 has	 incurred	 legal	 or	 constructive	 obligations	 or	 made	 payments	 on	 behalf	 of	 an	 	 associate.
Joint	 ventures	 include	 jointly	 controlled	 entities	 that	 are	 those	 entities	 over	 whose	activities	the	Group	has	joint	control,	established	by	contractual	 agreement.	 The	 consolidated	 financial	 statements	 include	 the	 Group’s	 share	of	the	total	recognised	gains	and	losses	of	jointly	controlled	entities	 on	 an	 equity	 accounted	 basis,	 from	 the	 date	 that	 joint	 control	 commences	 until	 the	 date	 that	 joint	 control	 ceases	 or	 the	 jointly	 controlled	 entity	 	 qualifies	 as	 a	 discontinued	 operation	 or	 disposal	 group	 at	 which	 point	 	 the	investment	is	carried	at	fair	value.
On	19	April	2006	the	Group	acquired	the	remaining	58%	of	the	shares	 of	 the	 UK	 business	 that	 were	 not	 already	 owned	 by	 the	 Group.	 As	 a	 result	the	Group	fully	consolidated	the	UK	business	from	that	date.	The	 acquisition	was	accounted	for	through	the	purchase	method	and	as	a	 consequence	 the	 entire	 assets	 and	 liabilities	 of	 the	 UK	 business	 were	 revalued	to	fair	value.	The	effect	of	these	adjustments	on	the	42%	of	the	 UK	business	already	owned	was	reflected	in	the	revaluation	reserve.
Goodwill
All	business	combinations	are	accounted	for	using	the	purchase	method.	 Goodwill	represents	the	difference	between	the	cost	of	acquisition	over	 the	 share	 of	 the	 fair	 value	 of	 identifiable	 net	 assets	 (including	 intangible	 	 assets)	of	a	subsidiary,	associate	or	jointly	controlled	entity	at	the	date	of 	 acquisition.	 Identifiable	 intangibles	 are	 those	 which	 can	 be	 sold	 separately	 or	 which	 arise	 from	 legal	 rights	 regardless	 of	 whether	 those	 rights	 are	 separable.	Goodwill	arising	on	the	acquisition	of	interests	in	associates	 	 or	joint	ventures	is	reflected	in	the	carrying	value	of	the	investment.
Business	combinations	that	took	place	prior	to	the	Group’s	transition 	 date	 to	 IFRS	 on	 1	 January	 2004	 have	 not	 been	 restated	 under	 the	 	 requirements	of	IFRS.
Notes to the accounts
Regus Report	&	Accounts	2006 40 2 Accounting policies continued
Positive	 goodwill	 is	 stated	 at	 cost	 less	 any	 provision	 for	 impairment	 in	 value.	An	impairment	test	is	carried	out	annually	and,	in	addition,	when -
ever	 indicators	 exist	 that	 the	 carrying	 amount	 may	 not	 be	 recoverable.	 Positive	 goodwill	 is	 allocated	 to	 cash-generating	 units	 for	 the	 purpose	 	 of	impairment	testing.
Impairment
The	 carrying	 amounts	 of	 the	 Group’s	 assets	 other	 than	 deferred	 tax	 assets,	are	reviewed	at	each	balance	sheet	date	to	determine	whether	 there	 is	 any	 indication	 of	 impairment.	 If	 any	 such	 indication	 exists,	 the	 asset’s	recoverable	amount	is	estimated.
For	 goodwill,	 assets	 that	 have	 an	 indefinite	 useful	 life	 and	 intangible	 assets	 that	are	not	yet	available	for	use,	the	recoverable	amount	was	estimated	 at	31	October	2006.
An	 impairment	 loss	 is	 recognised	 whenever	 the	 carrying	 amount	 of	 	 an	 asset	 or	 its	 cash-generating	 unit	 exceeds	 its	 recoverable	 amount.	 Impairment	losses	are	recognised	in	the	income	statement.
Impairment	losses	recognised	in	respect	of	cash-generating	units	are	 allocated	first	to	reduce	the	carrying	amount	of	any	goodwill	allocated	to	 the	cash-generating	unit	and	then	to	reduce	the	carrying	amount	of	the	 other	assets	in	the	unit	on	a	pro	rata	basis.	A	cash-generating	unit	is	the	 smallest	identifiable	group	of	assets	that	generates	cash	inflows	that	are	 largely	 independent	 of	 the	 cash	 inflows	 from	 other	 assets	 or	 groups	 	 of	assets.
Calculation of recoverable amount
The	 recoverable	 amount	 of	 relevant	 assets	 is	 the	 greater	 of	 their	 net	 selling	 price	 and	 value	 in	 use.	 In	 assessing	 value	 in	 use,	 the	 estimated	 future	 cash	flows	are	discounted	to	their	present	value	using	a	pre-tax	discount	 rate	that	reflects	current	market	assessments	of	the	time	value	of	money	 and	the	risks	specific	to	the	asset.	For	an	asset	that	does	not	generate	 largely	independent	cash	inflows,	the	recoverable	amount	is	determined	 for	the	cash-generating	unit	to	which	the	asset	belongs.
Intangible assets
Intangible	assets	acquired	separately	from	the	business	are	capitalised	at	 cost.	 Intangible	 assets	 acquired	 as	 part	 of	 an	 acquisition	 of	 a	 business	 are	 capitalised	 separately	 from	 goodwill	 if	 their	 fair	 value	 can	 be	 measured	 on	initial	recognition.
Intangible	 assets	 are	 amortised	 on	 a	 straight-line	 basis	 over	 the	 estimated	 useful	life	of	the	assets	as	follows:
Brand	–	Regus	brand	 Indefinite	life
Brand	–	other	acquired	brands		 20	years
Computer	software		 3-5	years
Customer	lists		 1-2	years
Amortisation	of	intangible	assets	is	expensed	through	administration	 expenses	in	the	income	statement.
Leases
Plant	 and	 equipment	 leases	 for	 which	 the	 Group	 assumes	 substantially	 all	 of	the	risks	and	rewards	of	ownership	are	classified	as	finance	leases.	All	 other	leases,	including	all	of	the	Group’s	property	leases	are	categorised	 as	operating	leases.
Finance leases
Plant	 and	 equipment	 acquired	 by	 way	 of	 a	 finance	 lease	 is	 capitalised	 	 at	 the	 commencement	 of	 the	 lease	 at	 the	 lower	 of	 its	 fair	 value	 and	 	 the	 present	 value	 of	 the	 minimum	 lease	 payments	 at	 inception.	 Future	 payments	 under	 finance	 leases	 are	 included	 in	 creditors,	 net	 of	 any	 future	 finance	 charges.	 Minimum	 lease	 payments	 are	 apportioned	 between	 the	finance	charge	and	the	reduction	of	the	outstanding	liability.	Finance	 charges	 are	 recognised	 in	 the	 income	 statement	 over	 the	 lease	 term	 	 so	 as	 to	 produce	 a	 constant	 periodic	 rate	 of	 interest	 on	 the	 remaining	 balance	of	the	liability.
Operating leases
Minimum	lease	payments	under	operating	leases	are	recognised	in	the	 income	 statement	 on	 a	 straight-line	 basis	 over	 the	 lease	 term.	 Lease	 	 incentives	 and	 rent	 free	 periods	 are	 included	 in	 the	 calculation	 of	 minimum	 lease	payments.	The	commencement	of	the	lease	term	is	the	date	from	 which	the	Group	is	entitled	to	use	the	leased	asset.	The	lease	term	is	the	 non-cancellable	period	of	the	lease,	together	with	any	further	periods	for	 which	the	Group	has	the	option	to	continue	to	lease	the	asset	and	when	 at	 the	 inception	 of	 the	 lease	 it	 is	 reasonably	 certain	 that	 the	 Group	 will	 exercise	that	option.
Contingent	 rentals	 include	 rent	 increases	 based	 on	 future	 inflation	 	 indices	 or	 non-guaranteed	 rental	 payments	 based	 on	 centre	 turnover	 	 or	 profitability	 and	 are	 excluded	 from	 the	 calculation	 of	 minimum	 lease	 payments.	 Contingent	 rentals	 are	 recognised	 in	 the	 income	 statement	 	 as	they	are	incurred.
Non-recurring items
Non-recurring	items	are	those	significant	items,	which	are	separately	 	 disclosed	 by	 virtue	 of	 their	 size	 or	 incidence	 to	 enable	 a	 full	 understanding	 of	the	Group’s	financial	performance.	Transactions	which	may	give	rise	 to	non-recurring	items	are	restructuring,	integration	costs	and	onerous	 commitments.
Property, plant and equipment
Property,	 plant	 and	 equipment	 is	 stated	 at	 cost	 less	 accumulated	 	 depreciation	 and	 any	 impairment	 in	 value.	 Depreciation	 is	 calculated	 on	 a	 straight-line	basis	over	the	estimated	useful	life	of	the	assets	as	follows:
Fixtures	and	fittings	 Over	the	shorter	of	the	lease	term	and	10	years
Furniture	 10	years
Office	equipment	and	telephones	 5-10	years
Motor	vehicles	 4	years
Computer	hardware	 3-5	years
Revenue
Revenue	from	the	provision	of	services	to	customers	is	measured	at	the	 fair	value	of	consideration	received	or	receivable	(excluding	sales	taxes).
Workstations
Workstation	revenue	is	recognised	when	the	provision	of	the	service	is 	 rendered.	Amounts	invoiced	in	advance	are	deferred	and	recognised	as	 revenue	upon	provision	of	the	service.
Customer service income
Service	income	(including	the	rental	of	meeting	rooms)	is	recognised	as	 services	are	rendered.	In	circumstances	where	Regus	acts	as	an	agent	 for	the	sale	and	purchase	of	goods	to	customers,	only	the	commission	 fee	earned	is	recognised	as	revenue.
Management and franchise fees
Fees	 received	 for	 the	 provision	 of	 initial	 and	 subsequent	 services	 are	 	 recognised	 as	 revenue	 as	 the	 services	 are	 rendered.	 Fees	 charged	 for	 the	 use	of	continuing	rights	granted	by	the	agreement,	or	for	other	services

provided	during	the	period	of	the	agreement,	are	recognised	as	revenue	 as	the	services	are	provided	or	the	rights	used.
These	categories	represent	all	material	sources	of	revenue	earned	from	 the	provision	of	global	workplace	solutions.
Employee benefits
The	Group’s	contributions	to	defined	contribution	plans	and	other	paid	 and	unpaid	benefits	earned	by	employees	are	charged	to	the	income	 statement	as	incurred.	 Share based payments
The	share	option	programme	entitles	certain	employees	and	directors	to	 acquire	 shares	 of	 the	 ultimate	 parent	 company;	 these	 awards	 are	 granted	 by	the	ultimate	parent.	The	fair	value	of	options	granted	is	recognised	as	 an	employee	expense	with	a	corresponding	increase	in	equity.	The	fair	 value	is	measured	at	grant	date	and	spread	over	the	period	during	which	 the	 employees	 become	 unconditionally	 entitled	 to	 the	 options.	 The	 fair	 value	 of	 the	 options	 granted	 is	 measured	 using	 Black	 Scholes	 valuation	 model	 or	 the	 Monte	 Carlo	 method,	 taking	 into	 account	 the	 terms	 and	 conditions	 upon	 which	 the	 options	 were	 granted.	 The	 amount	 recognised	 as	 an	 expense	 is	 adjusted	 to	 reflect	 the	 actual	 number	 of	 share	 options	 that	 vest	 except	 where	 forfeiture	 is	 due	 only	 to	 share	 prices	 not	 achieving	 the	threshold	for	vesting.	 Share	appreciation	rights	(CIP)	are	also	granted	by	the	Company	to	 certain	employees.	The	fair	value	of	the	amount	payable	to	the	employee	 is	recognised	as	an	expense	with	a	corresponding	increase	in	equity.	The	 fair	value	is	initially	recognised	at	grant	date	and	spread	over	the	period	 during	which	the	employees	become	unconditionally	entitled	to	payment.	 The	fair	value	of	the	share	appreciation	rights	is	measured	based	on	the	 Monte	 Carlo	 valuation	 model,	 taking	 into	 account	 the	 terms	 and	 conditions	 upon	which	the	instruments	were	granted.	The	liability	is	remeasured	at	 each	balance	sheet	date	and	at	settlement	date	and	any	change	in	fair	 value	recognised	in	profit	or	loss	spread	equally	over	the	vesting	period.
Taxation
Tax	on	the	profit	for	the	year	comprises	current	and	deferred	tax.	Tax	is	 recognised	in	the	income	statement	except	to	the	extent	that	it	relates	to 	 items	 recognised	 directly	 in	 equity,	 in	 which	 case	 it	 is	 recognised	 in	 equity.
Current	 tax	 is	 the	 expected	 tax	 payable	 on	 the	 taxable	 income	 for	 the	 year,	 using	 tax	 rates	 enacted	 or	 substantively	 enacted	 at	 the	 balance	 sheet	 date,	and	any	adjustment	to	tax	payable	in	respect	of	previous	years.
Deferred	tax	is	provided	on	temporary	differences	between	the	carrying	 amounts	of	assets	and	liabilities	for	financial	reporting	purposes	and	the	 amounts	 used	 for	 taxation	 purposes.	 The	 following	 temporary	 differences	 are	 not	 provided	 for:	 the	 initial	 recognition	 of	 goodwill;	 the	 initial	 recognition	 of	 assets	 and	 liabilities	 that	 affect	 neither	 accounting	 nor	 taxable	 profit	 other	 than	in	a	business	combination;	and	differences	relating	to	investments	 in	 subsidiaries	 to	 the	 extent	 that	 they	 will	 probably	 not	 reverse	 in	 the	 foreseeable	future.	The	amount	of	deferred	tax	provided	is	based	on	the	 expected	manner	of	realisation	or	settlement	of	the	carrying	amount	of	 assets	and	liabilities,	using	tax	rates	enacted	or	substantively	enacted	at	 the	balance	sheet	date.
A	deferred	tax	asset	is	recognised	only	to	the	extent	that	it	is	probable	 that	future	taxable	profits	will	be	available	against	which	the	asset	can	 	 be	utilised.	 Deferred	 tax	 assets	 and	 liabilities	 are	 offset	 when	 there	 is	 a	 legally	 	 enforceable	right	to	set	off	current	tax	assets	against	current	tax	liabilities	 and	 when	 they	 relate	 to	 income	 taxes	 levied	 by	 the	 same	 taxation	 authority	 and	the	Group	intends	to	settle	its	current	tax	assets	and	liabilities	on	a	 net	basis.
Provisions
Provisions	are	recognised	when	an	obligation	exists	for	a	future	liability 	 in	respect	of	a	past	event	and	where	the	amount	of	the	obligation	can	be	 reliably	estimated.
Restructuring	provisions	are	made	for	direct	expenditures	of	a	business 	 reorganisation	 where	 the	 plans	 are	 sufficiently	 detailed	 and	 well	 advanced	 and	where	the	appropriate	communication	to	those	affected	has	been	 undertaken	at	the	balance	sheet	date.
Provision	 is	 made	 for	 onerous	 contracts	 to	 the	 extent	 that	 the	 unavoidable	 costs	of	meeting	the	obligations	under	a	contract	exceed	the	economic 	 benefits	 expected	 to	 be	 delivered,	 discounted	 using	 an	 appropriate	 weighted	average	cost	of	capital.
Foreign currencies
Transactions	 in	 foreign	 currencies	 are	 recorded	 using	 the	 rate	 of	 	 exchange	 ruling	 at	 the	 date	 of	 the	 transaction.	 Monetary	 assets	 and	 	 liabilities	 denominated	 in	 foreign	 currencies	 are	 translated	 using	 the	 	 closing	 rate	 of	 exchange	 at	 the	 balance	 sheet	 date	 and	 the	 gains	 or	 losses	on	translation	are	taken	to	the	income	statement.	Non-monetary 	 assets	 and	 liabilities	 that	 are	 measured	 in	 terms	 of	 historical	 cost	 in	 a	 foreign	 currency	 are	 translated	 using	 the	 exchange	 rate	 at	 the	 date	 of	 	 the	transaction.
The	results	and	cash	flows	of	overseas	operations	are	translated	using	 the	average	rate	for	the	period.	Assets	and	liabilities,	including	goodwill	 and	fair	value	adjustments,	of	overseas	operations	are	translated	using	 the	closing	rate	with	all	exchange	differences	arising	on	consolidation	 being	recognised	in	the	foreign	currency	translation	reserve.	Exchange	 differences	are	released	to	the	income	statement	on	disposal.
Under	 the	 transition	 requirements	 of	 IFRS,	 cumulative	 translation	 	 differences	for	all	foreign	operations	have	been	set	to	zero	at	1	January	 2004.
Foreign	currency	differences	arising	on	the	retranslation	of	a	financial	 liability	designated	as	a	hedge	of	a	net	investment	in	a	foreign	operation 	 are	 recognised	 directly	 in	 equity,	 in	 the	 foreign	 currency	 translation	 reserve,	 to	the	extent	that	the	hedge	is	effective.	To	the	extent	that	the	hedge	is	 ineffective,	such	differences	are	recognised	in	profit	or	loss.	When	the	 hedged	net	investment	is	disposed	of,	the	cumulative	amount	in	equity	 	 is	 transferred	 to	 profit	 or	 loss	 as	 an	 adjustment	 to	 the	 profit	 or	 loss	 	 on	disposal.
Finance charges
Interest	charges	and	income	are	accounted	for	in	the	income	statement 	 on	an	accruals	basis.	Deferred	finance	fees	are	charged	to	the	income 	 statement	through	the	interest	expense	using	the	effective	rate	method.	 Where	 assets	 or	 liabilities	 on	 the	 Group	 balance	 sheet	 are	 carried	 at	 	 a	 discounted	 amount,	 the	 increase	 in	 the	 amount	 due	 to	 unwinding	 	 the	 discount	 is	 recognised	 as	 a	 finance	 expense	 or	 finance	 income	 as	 appropriate.

Interest bearing borrowings
Interest	bearing	borrowings	are	recognized	initially	at	fair	value	less	attributable	transaction	costs.	Subsequent	to	initial	recognition,	interest	bearing	 	 borrowings	are	stated	at	amortised	cost	with	any	difference	between	cost	and	redemption	value	being	recognised	in	the	income	statement	over	the	 period	of	the	borrowings	on	an	effective	interest	basis.	 Cash and cash equivalents
Cash	and	cash	equivalents	comprise	cash	at	bank	and	in	hand.

3 Segmental analysis – statutory basis
Segment	 information	 is	 presented	 in	 respect	 of	 the	 Group’s	 geographical	 segments.	 The	 Group’s	 primary	 activity	 and	 only	 business	 segment	 is	 the	 provision	 of	 global	 workplace	 solutions.	 Segment	 results,	 assets	 and	 liabilities	 include	 items	 directly	 attributable	 to	 a	 segment	 as	 well	 as	 those	 that	 	 can	 be	 allocated	 on	 a	 reasonable	 basis.	 There	 is	 no	 inter-segment	 trading.	 Management	 fees	 are	 in	 consideration	 of	 subsidiaries	 use	 of	 intellectual	 property	 and	 Group	 services	 including,	 but	 not	 limited	 to,	 business	 development	 services,	 purchasing,	 information	 technology,	 sales	 and	 marketing,	 finance	and	treasury,	human	resources	and	legal	services.	Unallocated	items	comprise	mainly	interest	bearing	loans,	borrowings	and	expenses,	and	 	 corporate	assets	and	expenses.	Segment	capital	expenditure	is	the	total	cost	(calculated	on	an	accruals	basis)	incurred	during	the	period	to	acquire	 segment	assets	that	are	expected	to	be	used	for	more	than	one	year.	The	business	is	run	on	a	worldwide	basis,	but	managed	through	four	principal	 geographical	segments:	Americas;	Europe,	Middle	East	and	Africa	(EMEA);	Asia	Pacific	and	the	United	Kingdom.	The	United	Kingdom	segment	was	 	 added	 following	 the	 acquisition	 on	 19	 April	 2006	 of	 the	 remaining	 58%	 of	 the	 share	 capital	 of	 the	 UK	 business	 (see	 note	 25).	 The	 United	 Kingdom	 	 segment	 does	 not	 include	 the	 Group’s	 non-trading	 head	 office	 and	 holding	 companies	 that	 are	 based	 in	 the	 UK.	 These	 are	 shown	 as	 unallocated.	 	 The	results	of	business	centres	in	each	of	these	regions	form	the	basis	for	reporting	geographical	results.

At	the	balance	sheet	date,	the	temporary	difference	arising	from	unremitted	earnings	of	overseas	subsidiaries	was	£26.7	million	(2005:	£17.0	million). 	 It	is	considered	that	no	significant	tax	liability	would	arise	should	these	reserves	be	remitted	due	to	available	overseas	tax	credits.

Cash-generating	 units,	 comprising	 individual	 business	 centres,	 are	 grouped	 by	 country	 of	 operation	 for	 the	 purpose	 of	 carrying	 out	 impairment	 reviews	 	 of	 non-current	 assets	 as	 this	 is	 the	 lowest	 level	 at	 which	 goodwill	 can	 be	 assessed.	 Goodwill	 acquired	 through	 business	 combinations	 is	 held	 at	 a	 country	level	and	is	subject	to	impairment	reviews	based	on	the	cash	flows	of	these	cash-generating	units.

The	recoverable	amount	of	each	of	the	groups	of	cash-generating	units	above	has	been	determined	based	on	their	value	in	use,	calculated	as	the	 present	 value	of	future	cash	flows	attributable	to	the	group.	 The	following	key	assumptions	have	been	used	in	calculating	value	in	use	for	each	group	of	cash-generating	units:
>	 future	cash	flows	are	based	on	budgets	for	2007	approved	by	the	Board.	Thereafter	a	prudent	growth	rate,	not	exceeding	3%	has	been	applied	to	 	 	 revenues	for	the	first	five	years	with	0%	growth	thereafter.	 >	 a	terminal	value	is	included	in	the	assessment	reflecting	the	Group’s	expectation	that	it	will	continue	to	operate	in	these	markets.
>	 a	pre-tax	discount	rate	has	been	applied	to	future	cash	flows	for	each	group	of	cash-generating	units,	based	on	an	underlying	post-tax	discount	 	 	 rate	of	12%,	grossed	up	by	the	applicable	tax	rate	in	each	country.
The	 calculation	 of	 the	 value	 in	 use	 is	 sensitive	 to	 changes	 in	 the	 expected	 level	 of	 long	 term	 profitability	 and	 the	 discount	 rate	 applied	 to	 the	 future	 cash	 flows.	 The	 trading	 conditions	 in	 which	 the	 Group	 operates	 is	 subject	 to	 competitive	 and	 economic	 pressures	 that	 can	 have	 a	 material	 effect	 on	 the	 operating	 performance	of	the	business.	 Forseeable	 events	 are	 unlikely	 to	 result	 in	 a	 change	 in	 the	 projections	 of	 a	 significant	 nature	 so	 as	 to	 result	 in	 a	 cash-generating	 units	 carrying	 amount	 	 to	 exceed	 its	 recoverable	 amount.	 A	 fall	 of	 more	 than	 12%	 in	 the	 future	 cash	 flows	 would	 be	 required	 to	 result	 in	 the	 carrying	 amount	 exceeding	 the	 	 recoverable	amount.
There	is	no	goodwill	relating	to	the	Group’s	joint	ventures.

Cash	not	available	for	use	at	31	December	2006	includes	cash	held	on	deposit	of	which	£5.5	million	(2005:	£3.1	million)	relates	to	collateral	against	 bank	 loans;	 £9.6	 million	 (2005:	 £14.1	 million)	 relates	 to	 deposits	 which	 are	 held	 by	 banks	 and	 landlords	 as	 security	 against	 lease	 commitments	 by	 Regus	operating	companies	and	£2.0	million	(2005:	£1.9	million)	held	by	the	ESOP	Trust.	These	amounts	are	blocked	and	not	available	for	use	by	 	 the	business.
Non-cash	changes	comprise	new	finance	leases,	changes	due	to	business	acquisitions	and	movements	between	categories.
23 Financial instruments
The	objectives,	policies	and	strategies	applied	by	the	Group	with	respect	to	financial	instruments	are	determined	at	Group	level.	Exposure	to	credit,	 	 interest	rate	and	currency	risks	arise	in	the	normal	course	of	business.	The	principal	financial	instruments	used	by	the	Group	to	finance	its	operations	 are	cash	and	loans.
Credit risk
A	 diversified	 customer	 base	 and	 requirement	 for	 customer	 deposits	 and	 payments	 in	 advance	 on	 workstation	 contracts	 minimizes	 the	 Group’s	 	 exposure	to	customer	credit	risk.
Cash	assets,	borrowings	and	derivative	financial	instruments	are	only	transacted	with	counterparties	of	sound	credit	ratings,	and	management	does	 	 not	expect	any	counterparty	to	fail	to	meet	its	obligations.
Interest rate risk
The	 Group’s	 debt	 is	 held	 at	 variable	 interest	 rates	 because	 further	 early	 repayment	 of	 the	 debt	 is	 probable.	 Finance	 leases	 are	 generally	 held	 at	 fixed	interest	rates.	Surplus	cash	balances	are	invested	to	achieve	maximum	interest	returns	on	a	day	to	day	basis.
Foreign currency risk
The	 Group’s	 exposure	 to	 currency	 risk	 at	 a	 transactional	 level	 is	 minimal	 as	 the	 majority	 of	 day	 to	 day	 transactions	 of	 overseas	 subsidiaries	 are	 carried	 	 out	in	local	currency.
The	majority	of	the	Group’s	net	assets	are	in	pounds	sterling,	US	dollars	and	euros.	The	Group	does	not	hedge	the	translation	effect	of	exchange	rate	 	 movements	on	the	income	statement.
Derivative financial instruments
Historically	the	Group	has	occasionally	used	derivative	financial	instruments	to	hedge	its	exposure	to	foreign	currency	and	interest	rate	fluctuations,	 	 although	 natural	 hedges	 limit	 the	 exposure	 to	 these	 risks.	 At	 31	 December	 2006	 there	 were	 no	 derivative	 financial	 instruments	 outstanding	 (2005:	 none).	 No	transactions	of	a	speculative	nature	are	undertaken.

Sensitivity analysis
At	31	December	2006	it	is	estimated	that	a	general	increase	of	one	percentage	point	in	interest	rates	would	increase	the	Group’s	profit	before	tax	by	 	 approximately	£0.3	million	(2005:	£0.4	million).
It	is	estimated	that	a	one	percentage	point	weakening	in	the	value	of	the	US	dollar	against	pounds	sterling	would	have	decreased	the	Group’s	profit	 	 before	 tax	 by	 approximately	 £0.4	 million	 for	 the	 year	 ended	 31	 December	 2006	 (2005:	 £0.3	 million).	 It	 is	 estimated	 that	 a	 one	 percentage	 point	 	 weakening	in	the	value	of	the	euro	against	pounds	sterling	would	have	decreased	the	Group’s	profit	before	tax	by	approximately	£0.1	million	for	the	 	 year	ended	31	December	2006	(2005:	£0.2	million).

Summary of methods and assumptions
Trade and other receivables/payables
For	receivables/payables	with	a	remaining	life	of	less	than	one	year,	the	notional	amount	is	deemed	to	reflect	the	fair	value.
Finance lease liabilities
The	fair	value	of	finance	leases	has	been	calculated	by	discounting	future	cash	flows	at	the	Group’s	weighted	average	cost	of	capital.
Loans and overdrafts
The	 fair	 value	 of	 bank	 loans,	 overdrafts	 and	 other	 loans	 approximates	 to	 the	 carrying	 value	 because	 interest	 rates	 are	 at	 floating	 rates	 where	 payments	 are	reset	to	market	rates	at	intervals	of	less	than	one	year.

Performance conditions for share options
The	plan	includes	certain	performance	criteria	that	need	to	be	met	in	order	for	share	options	to	vest.	A	proportion	of	the	share	options	vest	as	shown	 	 below	 should	 the	 basic	 earnings	 per	 share,	 adjusted	 for	 non-recurring	 items	 and	 goodwill	 and	 intangible	 amortisation	 exceed	 targets	 linked	 to	 the	 Retail	 Price	Index	(RPI).	The	basic	earnings	per	share	for	perfomance	purposes	was	1p.	No	options	are	exercisable	at	the	year-end.

Note:	%	denotes	the	%	of	award	which	will	be	released	at	the	end	of	the	performance	period.
In	 addition,	 no	 awards	 will	 be	 released	 unless	 the	 Company’s	 TSR	 is	 at	 least	 at	 the	 median	 when	 compared	 against	 that	 of	 the	 companies	 comprising	 	 the	FTSE	350	Support	Services	Sector	at	the	date	of	grant.
It	is	recognised	by	the	Remuneration	Committee	that	the	additional	EPS	targets	represent	a	highly	challenging	goal	and	consequently	in	determining	 whether	they	have	been	met	the	Committee	will	exercise	its	discretion.	The	overall	aim	is	that	the	relevant	EPS	targets	must	have	been	met	on	a	run	 	 rate	or	underlying	basis.	As	such	an	adjusted	measure	of	EPS	will	be	calculated	designed	to	assess	the	underlying	performance	of	the	business.	 While	 the	 Remuneration	 Committee	 reserves	 the	 right	 to	 adjust	 EPS	 as	 it	 sees	 fit	 at	 the	 time,	 by	 way	 of	 example,	 the	 following	 adjustments	 are	 	 currently	anticipated:
>	 In 	 a	 growth	 company	 such	 as	 Regus,	 costs	 are	 necessarily	 incurred	 in	 one	 year	 to	 drive	 profits	 in	 future	 years.	 As	 such	 it	 is	 important	 to	 ensure	 	 	 management 	 is	 not	 incentivised	 to	 cut	 back	 on	 these	 investments	 to	 meet	 EPS	 targets	 in	 any	 one	 year.	 Accordingly	 those	 costs,	 incurred	 in	 the	 	 	 vesting 	 year,	 which	 it	 considers	 necessary	 to	 drive	 future	 growth	 will	 be	 excluded	 from	 the	 EPS	 calculation.	 These	 would	 include,	 inter	 alia,	 the	 	 	 costs	of	the	business	development	departments,	excess	marketing	expenditures	and	current	year	losses	from	investing	in	new	locations.
>	 Any	one-off	or	non-recurring	costs	will	be	excluded.
>	 It 	 is	 expected	 that	 in	 the	 period	 between	 2006	 and	 2009	 the	 cash	 tax	 rate	 will	 rise	 as	 cumulative	 tax	 losses	 are	 utilised	 thereby	 increasing	 	 	 progressively	the	challenge	of	achieving	a	14p	EPS	target.	This	will	then	be	further	complicated	by	the	need	to	recognise	deferred	tax	assets	as	 	 	 the	business	strengthens	reducing	the	accounting	rate	of	tax	in	one	year	and	increasing	it	in	the	next.	To	provide	greater	clarity	and	incentive	to	 	 	 management	EPS	will	be	calculated	based	upon	the	cash	tax	rate	up	to	a	maximum	of	30%.
>	 The	Remuneration	Committee	is	of	the	opinion	that	the	EPS	and	free	cash	flow	performance	targets	are	a	transparent	and	accurate	measure	 	 	 of 	 the	 Company’s	 performance	 at	 this	 time	 and	 are	 the	 key	 corporate	 metrics	 for	 driving	 long	 term	 shareholder	 value.	 In	 addition,	 the	 TSR	 	 	 condition	will	ensure	that	executives	are	encouraged	to	focus	on	ensuring	that	the	Company’s	return	to	shareholders	is	competitive	compared	 	 	 to	comparable	companies.		 As	 mentioned	 above,	 awards	 under	 the	 CIP	 in	 respect	 of	 the	 bonus	 paid	 for	 the	 year	 ended	 31	 December	 2006	 will	 be	 made	 subsequent	 to	 the	 	 publication	 of	 this	 report.	 However,	 the	 maximum	 number	 of	 awards	 granted	 will	 be	 based	 on	 the	 price	 of	 an	 ordinary	 share	 at	 the	 time	 of	 grant	 and	 the	 monetary	 value	 will	 not	 exceed	 50%	 of	 basic	 salary.	 Full	 details	 of	 the	 levels	 of	 award	 and	 performance	 conditions	 will	 be	 disclosed	 in	 the	 Committee’s	 Remuneration	Report	for	the	year	ending	31	December	2007.

Acquisition of the remaining interest in the UK business
On	 19	 April	 2006,	 the	 acquisition	 date,	 the	 Group	 purchased	 the	 remaining	 58%	 equity	 share	 in	 the	 UK	 associate	 (Regus	 Holdings	 (UK)	 Limited)	 from	 	 Rex	 2002	 Limited,	 a	 company	 controlled	 by	 funds	 managed	 by	 Alchemy	 Partners,	 for	 a	 cash	 consideration	 of	 £88.0	 million.

All	consideration	was	paid	in	cash.	There	was	no	deferred	consideration.
The	fair	value	adjustments	include:
(a)	A	valuation	of	the	UK	brand	was	conducted	at	the	date	of	acquisition.	“Relief	from	royalty”	approach	was	used	as	the	valuation	method.	Under	this	method	the	fair	value	is	 	 	 equal	to	the	amount	saved	through	the	avoidance	of	royalty	payments	in	perpetuity.	A	1%	royalty	rate	and	12%	weighted	average	cost	of	capital	was	used	for	the	valuation.
(b)	The	valuation	of	property,	plant	and	equipment	was	based	on	a	market	valuation	approach,	unless	market	values	were	not	available	in	which	case	a	depreciated	replacement 	 	 cost	method	was	used.
(c)	Leasehold	interest	valuations	were	based	on	the	difference	between	contract	rent	and	market	rent	over	the	lease	term	discounted	to	net	present	value	at	a	weighted	average	 	 	 cost	of	12%.
The	 Group’s	 42%	 shareholding	 in	 the	 UK	 associate	 has	 been	 revalued	 in	 the	 course	 of	 accounting	 for	 the	 acquisition.	 A	 revaluation	 of	 £10.0	 million,	 	 representing	 42%	 of	 the	 fair	 value	 adjustments	 of	 £23.7	 million,	 has	 been	 applied	 to	 the	 Group’s	 existing	 shareholding	 in	 the	 UK	 associate	 with	 a	 	 corresponding	revaluation	reserve	of	£10.0	million	being	created	in	equity.
The	goodwill	arising	on	the	above	acquisitions	reflects	the	anticipated	future	benefits	Regus	can	obtain	from	operating	the	businesses	more	efficiently,	 primarily	through	increasing	occupancy	and	the	addition	of	value	adding	services.

In	addition	contingent	consideration	up	to	a	maximum	of	£0.6	million	has	not	been	recognised	in	the	balance	sheet	due	to	the	uncertain	nature	of	the	 	 future	events	on	which	the	payments	are	contingent	upon.	The	above	fair	values	are	provisional.
If	the	above	acquisitions	had	occurred	on	1	January	2006,	the	revenue	and	net	retained	loss	arising	from	these	acquisitions	would	have	been	£42.9	 	 million	and	£0.5	million	respectively.	In	the	year	these	acquisitions	contributed	revenue	of	£21.1	million	and	a	net	retained	loss	of	£0.3	million.
The	goodwill	arising	on	the	above	acquisitions	reflects	the	anticipated	future	benefits	Regus	can	obtain	from	operating	the	businesses	more	efficiently,	 primarily	through	increasing	occupancy	and	the	addition	of	value	adding	services.
Adjustments to provisional fair values for 2005 acquisitions
Additional	 consideration	 of	 £0.3	 million	 was	 paid	 in	 January	 2007	 due	 to	 improved	 financial	 performance	 of	 acquisitions	 under	 contractual	 earn-out	 	 provisions.	This	resulted	in	an	increase	in	goodwill	of	£0.3	million.

(a)	Shares	held	directly	by	Regus	Group	plc.
Investments	 in	 Group	 subsidiaries	 are	 held	 at	 cost	 all	 of	 which	 are	 included	 within	 the	 consolidated	 results.	 The	 principal	 activity	 of	 all	 trading	 	 companies	is	the	provision	of	global	workplace	solutions.	 31 Key judgmental areas adopted in preparing these accounts
The	 preparation	 of	 financial	 statements	 in	 accordance	 with	 IFRS	 requires	 management	 to	 make	 certain	 judgements	 and	 assumptions	 that	 affect	 	 reported	amounts	and	related	disclosures.
Fair value accounting for business combinations
For	each	business	combination,	we	assess	the	fair	values	of	assets	and	liabilities	acquired.	Where	there	is	not	an	active	market	in	the	category	of	 	 the	non-current	assets	typically	acquired	with	a	business	centre	or	where	the	books	and	records	of	the	acquired	company	do	not	provide	sufficient	 	 information	to	derive	an	accurate	valuation,	management	calculate	an	estimated	fair	value	based	on	available	information	and	experience.	The	main	 	 categories	of	acquired	non-current	assets	where	management’s	judgement	has	an	impact	on	the	amounts	recorded	include	tangible	fixed	assets,	 	 customer	list	intangibles	and	the	fair	market	value	of	leasehold	assets	and	liabilities.	For	significant	business	combinations	management	also	obtain	 	 third	party	valuations	to	provide	additional	guidance	over	the	appropriate	valuation	to	be	included	in	the	financial	statements.		 Valuation of intangibles and goodwill
We	evaluate	the	carrying	value	of	goodwill	and	intangibles	to	assess	potential	impairments	on	an	annual	basis,	or	during	the	year	if	an	event	or	other	 	 circumstance	 indicates	 that	 we	 may	 not	 be	 able	 to	 recover	 the	 carrying	 amount	 of	 the	 asset.	 We	 evaluate	 the	 carrying	 value	 of	 goodwill	 at	 the	 appropriate	 cash-generating	unit	level	and	make	that	determination	based	upon	future	cash	flow	projections,	which	assume	certain	growth	projections	which	may	 or	may	not	occur.	We	record	an	impairment	loss	for	goodwill	when	the	carrying	value	of	the	intangible	asset	is	less	than	its	estimated	fair	value.
Deferred tax assets 
We	base	our	estimate	of	deferred	tax	assets	and	liabilities	on	current	tax	laws	and	rates	and,	in	certain	cases,	business	plans	and	other	expectations	 	 about	 future	 outcomes.	 Changes	 in	 existing	 laws	 and	 rates,	 and	 their	 related	 interpretations,	 and	 future	 business	 results	 may	 affect	 the	 amount	 of	 	 deferred	tax	liabilities	or	the	valuation	of	deferred	tax	assets	over	time.	Our	accounting	for	deferred	tax	consequences	represents	management’s	best	 	 estimate	of	future	events	that	can	be	appropriately	reflected	in	the	accounting	estimates.	It	is	current	Group	policy	to	recognise	a	deferred	tax	asset	if	 	 the	entity	has	made	a	taxable	profit	in	the	previous	year	and	is	forecast	to	make	a	profit	in	the	forthcoming	year.	Deferred	tax	assets	are	generally	not	 	 recognised	for	the	period	in	excess	of	12	months	from	the	year-end.
Onerous lease provisions
We	have	identified	certain	poor	performing	centres	where	the	lease	is	considered	onerous	i.e.	the	Group	does	not	expect	to	recover	the	unavoidable	 	 lease	costs	up	to	the	first	break	point.	The	accounts	include	a	provision	for	our	estimate	of	the	net	amounts	payable	under	the	terms	of	the	lease	to	 	 the	first	break	point,	discounted	at	the	Group	weighted	average	cost	of	capital,	where	appropriate.
Dilapidations
Certain	of	our	leases	with	landlords	include	a	clause	obliging	the	Group	to	hand	the	property	back	in	the	condition	as	at	the	date	of	signing	the	lease.	 	 The	 costs	 to	 bring	 the	 property	 back	 to	 that	 condition	 are	 not	 known	 until	 the	 Group	 exit	 the	 property	 so	 the	 Group	 estimates	 the	 costs	 at	 each	 balance	 sheet	 date.	 However,	 given	 that	 landlords	 often	 regard	 the	 nature	 of	 changes	 made	 to	 properties	 as	 improvements,	 the	 Group	 estimates	 that	 it	 is	 	 unlikely	 that	 any	 material	 dilapidation	 payments	 will	 be	 necessary.	 Consequently	 provision	 has	 been	 made	 only	 for	 those	 potential	 dilapidation	 	 payments	that	can	be	measured	with	certainty	at	31	December	2006.

Accounting policies
The	 following	 accounting	 policies	 have	 been	 applied	 consistently	 in	 dealing	 with	 items	 which	 are	 considered	 material	 in	 relation	 to	 the	 Company’s	 	 financial	statements.
Basis of preparation
The	 financial	 statements	 have	 been	 prepared	 in	 accordance	 with	 applicable	 United	 Kingdom	 accounting	 standards	 and	 under	 the	 historical	 cost	 	 accounting	rules.
The	Company	is	included	in	the	consolidated	accounts	of	Regus	Group	plc.
The	 Company	 has	 taken	 advantage	 of	 the	 exemption	 contained	 in	 FRS	 8	 and	 has	 therefore	 not	 disclosed	 transactions	 or	 balances	 with	 entities	 which	 	 form	part	of	the	Group.
In	accordance	with	FRS	1	(revised),	the	Company	is	exempt	from	the	requirement	to	prepare	a	cash	flow	statement	within	these	financial	statements.	 	 As	 permitted	 by	 Section	 230	 of	 the	 Companies	 Act	 1985,	 the	 profit	 and	 loss	 account	 of	 the	 Company	 has	 not	 been	 included	 as	 part	 of	 these	 accounts.	 	 The	Company’s	profit	for	the	financial	year	was	£64.2	million	(2005:	£0.7	million)
Investments
Fixed	asset	investments	are	stated	at	cost	less	provision	for	impairment.
Taxation
The	 charge	 for	 taxation	 is	 based	 on	 the	 profit	 for	 the	 year	 and	 takes	 into	 account	 taxation	 deferred	 because	 of	 timing	 differences	 between	 the	 treatment	 	 of	 certain	 items	 for	 taxation	 and	 accounting	 purposes.	 Deferred	 tax	 is	 recognised,	 without	 discounting,	 in	 respect	 of	 all	 timing	 differences	 between	 the	 	 treatment	of	certain	items	for	taxation	and	accounting	purposes	which	have	arisen	but	not	reversed	by	the	balance	sheet	date,	except	as	otherwise	 	 required	by	FRS	19.

Parent company accounts Accounting policies continued
Foreign currencies
Transactions	 in	 foreign	 currencies	 are	 recorded	 using	 the	 rate	 of	 exchange	 ruling	 at	 the	 date	 of	 the	 transaction.	 Monetary	 assets	 and	 liabilities	 denominated	in	foreign	currencies	are	translated	using	the	rate	ruling	at	the	balance	sheet	date	and	the	gains	or	losses	on	translation	are	included	 in	the	profit	and	loss	account.
Financial guarantee contracts
Where	 the	 Company	 enters	 into	 financial	 guarantee	 contracts	 to	 guarantee	 the	 indebtedness	 or	 liabilities	 of	 other	 companies	 within	 its	 Group,	 the	 Company	considers	these	to	be	insurance	arrangements	and	accounts	for	them	as	such.	In	this	respect,	the	Company	treats	the	guarantee	contract	 as	a	contingent	liability	until	such	time	as	it	becomes	probable	that	the	Company	will	be	required	to	make	a	payment	under	the	guarantee.

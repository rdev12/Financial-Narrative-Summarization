statutory basis
- Strong cash performance
- Record order book at £46 billion
- Good performance from North America with underlying organic sales growth of 11%
- Customer Solutions & Support again delivered a robust performance
- Good progress towards stabilising the UK MoD Programmes business
- Turnaround in International Partnerships, driven by second half performance in MBDA and AMS and exit from Astrium
- Airbus results maintained in difficult market
- Avionics business impacted by reduced throughput and rationalisation activity
Good sustained underlying growth is anticipated across the company’s operations in North America and in International Partnerships
with some recovery in the Avionics business. The performance of the Programmes business is expected to continue to be restrained
with some UK MoD production programmes still in early phases of maturity. Margins in Customer Solutions & Support are likely to
continue to trend downwards. Overall, underlying performance of the company’s defence businesses in 2004 is expected to be
slightly ahead of 2003.
Airbus plans a volume of activity for 2004 similar to 2003, with a slightly lower value mix of deliveries.
Outlook
Results in brief 2 BAE SYSTEMS Annual report 2003
Significant progress
This has been a year of significant progress.
We have continued to build on our good first
half and have delivered full year results to
plan. In parallel, we have made good
progress on stabilising major programmes in
the UK. We remain committed to the twin
objectives of improving our performance to
meet the expectations of our customers and
delivering enhanced shareholder value. 
Dividend
The Board is recommending a maintained
final ordinary dividend of 5.5p per share,
making a total for the year of 9.2p per
share. Subject to shareholder approval at
the 2004 Annual General Meeting, the
dividend will be paid on 1 June 2004 to
holders of ordinary shares registered on 
23 April 2004.
A strong company
We remain focused on leveraging the strong
positions and relationships we enjoy in key
markets.   
“We remain committed to the twin objectives
of improving our performance to meet the
expectations of our customers and
delivering enhanced shareholder value.”
We have a robust and productive relationship
with the UK Ministry of Defence and are a
firmly established constituent of the US
defence industry where we continue to grow
our position. In continental Europe we have
strong positions on key programmes such as
Typhoon and are a proud and active partner
in Airbus.  
Underpinning these positions is world-class
technology and the expertise of our people.
This is illustrated by the high quality of
entries for our annual Chairman’s Award for
Innovation which this year attracted a record
3,000 entries from across the company.
Corporate governance and Board changes 
The Board and I take our obligations
regarding corporate governance very
seriously. The Board has reviewed the new
Combined Code on Corporate Governance
for UK listed companies. Whilst we are not
required to report formally our compliance
against the new code until next year, we
recognise that it is the most recent
authoritative statement on best practice for
companies and therefore later in this report
we disclose how we stand relative to its
provisions. 
Chairman’s letter to shareholders
  BAE SYSTEMS Annual report 2003 3
Sir Peter Mason and Michael Hartnall joined
the Board in 2003; both possess a good deal
of relevant experience and knowledge and are
valuable additions to the Board. Sir Charles
Masefield, Sir Robin Biggam and Keith Brown
all retired from the Board during the year and
Paolo Scaroni will be retiring from the Board
at the conclusion of this year’s Annual
General Meeting.
Business transformation
In recent years BAE Systems has undergone
a radical transformation from a UK-based
aircraft manufacturer to a broadly-based
systems business. Through this
transformation the company has achieved a
more balanced portfolio and geographic
spread. Today BAE Systems is one of a small
group of companies at the top of the world’s
aerospace and defence industry. 
Looking forward we have taken clear steps to
remove impediments to future progress in our
UK Programmes business. We are well
positioned in our key markets and our order
book remains strong.
Sir Richard Evans
Chairman
25 February 2004 4 BAE SYSTEMS Annual report 2003
Performance 
BAE Systems has market leading businesses
operating in the fields of systems and
software, support services and, through
Airbus, large commercial jets. Together these
activities represent some 80% of the group’s
sales. Much of the recent focus of attention
has been on the under-performance of our
major UK Ministry of Defence (MoD)
programmes. Good progress has been made
towards the removal of excessive risk and the
restoration of profitable growth in this latter
portfolio that represents the remaining 20%
of the group. 
The North America business group performed
well, with double digit organic growth and
strong cash flows. This business continued to
design, develop and supply world class
systems and expertise to key US
programmes.   
Customer Solutions & Support made further
progress in growing business in the UK with
an innovative cost and supply chain
management programme with the UK MoD’s
Defence Logistics Organisation. In Saudi
Arabia the strong relationship of many years
continues with the Al Yamamah defence
support programme. 
“Our overall priorities are to deliver enhanced
performance and improve returns,
particularly from our major UK defence
programmes in the medium-term, and to
continue to grow our business in the US.”
Chief executive’s review
Through our Commercial Aerospace business
we are an active partner in all aspects of
Airbus. Airbus performed strongly in a difficult
market that endured the effects of the SARS
virus, the Iraq conflict and the underlying
airline industry cycle. Looking forward, Airbus
is very well positioned for strong growth over
the medium-term.
Much of our business in continental Europe is
conducted in partnership with other
aerospace and defence companies. Our
recent focus has been on enhancing the
performance of these partnerships.
We have taken a three-pronged approach to
improving performance. Firstly, we work hard
with partners to maximise value and the
progress of our MBDA guided weapons joint
venture is successfully demonstrating the
benefit of this approach. Secondly, where
appropriate, we seek to achieve greater
clarity of overall management control, as we
have with the restructuring of STN Atlas,
where we have taken 100% ownership of
Atlas Elektronik, and the steps we are taking
on Eurosystems with Finmeccanica. Thirdly,
where activities are no longer core to our
strategy and show inadequate returns we will
exit, as we did with Astrium. 
Progress has been made to stabilise the
performance of the UK MoD programmes. 
In Air Systems there has been significant
progress on Nimrod and Hawk. Typhoon is
now in production with deliveries to our
customers underway. In order to determine
the way forward and reduce uncertainty, a key
objective remains to conclude the
negotiations with regard to the next phase of
the Typhoon weapon system development and
the second tranche of production aircraft.
In Naval Systems we successfully achieved all
of our 2003 key objectives and milestones for
the Astute submarine, Type 45 destroyer,
Landing Platform Dock, Landing Ship Dock
(Auxiliary) and Sting Ray torpedo programmes. 
Managing risk
If we are to drive growth and value
successfully it is essential that we establish
an appropriate balance of risk and reward in
contracts, notably in our major UK
programmes. In February 2003, as previously
announced, agreements to share risk and
reward with the UK customer were
established. During 2004, it is expected that
the UK’s new Carrier programme will proceed
from the final stage of assessment into the
systems design phase. The terms of this
  BAE SYSTEMS Annual report 2003 5
contract will provide an opportunity to
demonstrate the substantial progress that
has been made jointly with the MoD in
rebalancing risk and reward arrangements for
future major contracts.
Programme management
Our focus on ensuring that the best people
are using the best processes and are
subjected to the most rigorous internal and
external reviews has improved the stability
and predictability of our programmes. In close
collaboration with the UK MoD we now
monitor our performance on strategic
milestones across a number of our major
programmes. Performance is also regularly
assessed by the company’s Executive
Committee, the group responsible for the
day-to-day running of the company.
However, we recognise that there is more still
to be done. Our aim is two-fold: to
out-perform the industry and to ensure that
our approach to programme management, as
set out in our Operational Framework,
becomes truly embedded in the way we do
business, throughout the company. 
Our people
At the heart of BAE Systems, and its joint
ventures, lies a highly qualified and dedicated
workforce and I would like to thank them for
their continued support and commitment.
Priorities
Our overall priorities are to deliver enhanced
performance and improve returns, particularly
from our major UK defence programmes in
the medium-term, and to continue to grow our
business in the US. We will do this by
exploiting fully the opportunities that come
from our strong market positions and
continuing to improve our programme
management capabilities. We are determined
to succeed, and remain committed to
achieving an acceptable and sustainable
return for shareholders.
Mike Turner
Chief executive
25 February 2004 6 BAE SYSTEMS Annual report 2003
Our group strategy is ‘To create
sustainable shareholder value by being the
premier transatlantic aerospace and
defence contractor’. This strategy reflects
our commitment to delivering profitable
growth through improved performance, and
to building a consistent track record. We
recognise that to achieve this means
extending our mutually beneficial
relationships with our customers. 
The transatlantic focus of our strategy
reflects our presence in the UK, continental
Europe and in the United States. The
United States is the world’s largest
aerospace and defence market, and it is in
this market that we are most actively
seeking to grow our business. In the UK
and Europe we already have a leading
position from which to deliver profitable
growth. 
As our market position is spread
geographically, it is also spread between
sectors. Defence remains our core market
with some 60% of the company’s total
sales now from systems and software and
support services and some 20% from
defence platform systems programmes.
The balance of our portfolio comes from
commercial aircraft, primarily through our
involvement in Airbus. 
Delivery of our strategy will be achieved via
four group strategic objectives. The first of
these, to ‘Optimise the value of our
current order book’, means building on our
strong market positions and turning orders
into profit. In doing this we will deliver
increased value to our shareholders. 
Our second objective recognises the
location of our most important markets. We
seek to ‘Create a geographic profile based
on a transatlantic and tactical global
presence’. Transatlantic means more than
our presence either side of the Atlantic. We
actively seek to take part in industrial
partnerships and collaborative
programmes, and play a major role in joint
US/UK programmes. 
In maintaining a tactical global presence,
we will continue to export to, and work in,
selected markets around the world where
we can deliver appropriate shareholder
returns.
To create and maintain a position from
where we can deliver value to our
shareholders we will ‘Proactively manage
investment and divestment in businesses’
based upon value creation criteria. Where
markets have attractive terms of trade, we
will look to grow our position and deliver
the best possible returns. Where
businesses operate in markets considered
non-strategic, they must justify their role by
value creation and contribution to the
group’s performance.
The last of our four group strategic
objectives reflects the behaviours that we
expect from our people. We have taken
actions to ‘Embed a high performance
culture’ through our Performance Centred
Leadership framework. Our challenge is to
ensure that these principles are embedded
throughout BAE Systems, and that all of
our people and our partners understand
what is expected of them.
These four strategic objectives are being
pursued through seven strands of business
portfolio actions supported by the
integrated business plans of our
operations.

are underway to remove the uncertainty over

the operational capability of the aircraft prior
to the award of contracts for Tranche 2
development and production. Satisfactory
resolution of these negotiations is key to
Typhoon becoming a major contributor to the
performance of the Programmes business.
After the down-select for 18 Typhoon aircraft
from the Austrian government, the
Singaporean government announced that
Typhoon has been shortlisted as one of three
candidates to meet its defence requirements. 
The outlook for the Hawk programme
improved significantly in July when the next
generation of Hawk was selected as the RAF’s
Advanced Jet Trainer. This good news was
followed in September by the announcement
from the Indian government of its intention to
purchase 66 Hawk aircraft. Conclusion of
contract negotiations is anticipated in 2004.
In addition, the South African and Bahraini
Hawk programmes progressed on schedule. 
There was continued progress in the early
stages of development on the JSF programme
where BAE Systems is a partner with
Lockheed Martin and Northrop Grumman.
BAE Systems has a major involvement in the
programme with the design and manufacture
of the rear fuselage, stabilisers and
substantial avionics sub-systems and
equipment. The preliminary design review for
the conventional take-off and landing variant
was completed in 2003. Further work is
necessary on the short take-off vertical
landing variant to achieve an equivalent
position. Agreeing appropriate transfer of

Overview
In 2003, the Programmes business made a
profit
2
of £56m (2002 £69m) on sales of
£2,436m (2002 £2,171m) and generated an
operating cash inflow
3
of £33m (2002 outflow
£177m).  
The 2.3% return on sales for Programmes
reflects the substantial sales generating no
profit contribution from the Nimrod and Astute
programmes as a consequence of prior year
provisions. In addition, a low level of sales
and no profit were recognised on the Typhoon
programme ahead of conclusion of
negotiations on the second tranche contract.
Type 45 destroyer sales have also been
recognised at zero margin with the
programme at an early stage of maturity.
Positive contributions to profit were achieved
from underwater systems, naval ships and
sustaining engineering activity on Tornado and
Harrier. The F-35 Joint Strike Fighter (JSF)
systems design and development contract, a
cost plus award fee contract, also made a
positive contribution.
Sea systems activities were reorganised to
focus submarine capabilities at the Barrow
yard in the north of England and surface
ships on the Clyde in Scotland.
The outlook at Programmes is for increased
sales in 2004 as deliveries of Typhoon
aircraft increase. Overall, the contribution
from Programmes will continue to be
restrained until such time as the negotiations
on Typhoon are completed.
Air systems businesses
There was good progress on Nimrod against
the revised programme. Project reforms have
been implemented with a new project
management framework now in place, a new
programme schedule agreed and the signing
of a new contract in February 2004.

technology between the UK and the US on
this programme will be a key objective during
2004.
A particular highlight was the delivery to plan
of the last of 142 Tornado GR4 Mid Life
Update aircraft. Following the successful
completion of that programme, a major
weapon system upgrade of the Harrier GR7
aircraft to the GR9 standard is now underway. 
Naval systems businesses
Detailed work has been undertaken to
restructure the Astute submarine contract to
reflect the agreement reached with the MoD
in February 2003, culminating with the
signing of a new contract in December 2003.
Work on the project has progressed well
throughout the year with significant
milestones in both engineering and
production being achieved in the final quarter. 
The key design review milestone for the Type
45 destroyer was passed and the transition
from design to production started in August
2003. The high standard of maturity of design
achieved at the start of production is an
important factor in mitigating programme risk.
By the end of 2003, nine (out of twenty four)
separate units of the first vessel were in
manufacture in BAE Systems Clyde shipyards,
with a further three (out of sixteen) units in
manufacture under contract with VT Group.
The decision to concentrate the manufacture
of all Type 45 destroyers in the Govan and
Scotstoun shipyards underlines our long term
commitment to maintaining shipbuilding
centres of excellence on the Clyde.

RFA Wave Knight, Auxiliary Oiler, and Battlespace Management
Evaluation Centre
The contract to supply three Offshore Patrol
Vessels to the Royal Brunei Navy is well
advanced with customer acceptance of the
first vessel expected early in 2004 following
an extensive programme of sea trials and
combat systems trials during 2003. The
second vessel had also commenced sea
trials by the end of 2003. 
Both Auxiliary Oilers, RFA Wave Knight and
RFA Wave Ruler, achieved final acceptance
and entered service during 2003. 
HMS Albion, the first of two Landing Platform
Docks, was accepted by the MoD in April and
entered service in July 2003. The second
ship, HMS Bulwark, is scheduled for
completion early in the second half of 2004.
BAE Systems is building two Landing Ship
Dock (Auxiliary) vessels. For this contract,
BAE Systems is building the vessels under
subcontract from the MoD. Outfitting of the
first, RFA Mounts Bay, started following the
successful joining of the blocks on the berth
at Govan. Launch of the vessel is planned for
the first half of 2004.
The tactical weapons systems update
programme of the Trafalgar Class submarines
for the Royal Navy remained on schedule
during 2003. Key achievements included the
completion of the HMS Trenchant refits and
sea trials and acceptance of the upgraded
sonar functionality on HMS Torbay.
A contract valued at £375m for Sting Ray
Mod 1 torpedoes was awarded by the MoD
and Archerfish was sold to the US Navy for
their Airborne Mine Neutralisation System.
Deliveries of the Spearfish heavy torpedo
were completed, to schedule, in November
2003.
C4ISR
The C4ISR business has a key role in
developing and delivering the UK’s network
enabled capability. BAE Systems is working
towards establishing a central role with the
MoD in creating and developing the MoD’s
overall systems architecture.
The development of C4ISR’s capability was
greatly enhanced during the year with the
launch of the Battlespace Management
Evaluation Centre (BMEC). 
The BMEC simulates and evaluates complex
systems within operational scenarios early in
a programme life-cycle. Recent successes
include the NITEworks, Watchkeeper and
National Missile Defence projects’ integration
and experimentation trials.
The 4D Battlespace Engineering Process was
also launched during the year. Key to
information systems projects, it looks across
the whole battlespace environment of land,
sea, air and space. Customer Solutions & Support
The contract to reactivate four Upholder class
submarines for the Canadian Navy progressed
well with the second and third boats handed
over during the year. The final boat, HMS
Upholder, is due to be delivered in the first
half of 2004. 
In the UK the group renewed its partnering
agreement with the MoD’s Defence Logistics
Organisation (DLO). The agreement aims to
achieve better value for money for the DLO
and to generate new business for the
company, whilst improving support to armed
forces in the front-line. 
Underpinning the agreement, long-term
support contracts have been won and are
performing well on the key UK air platforms:
Tornado; Harrier; and Nimrod. In addition, a
significant order was secured on the UK
RAF's in-service fleet of VC10 aircraft,
consolidating the current arrangements into a
single prime contract under CS&S and
providing enhanced value for money to the
DLO.
Support and services joint ventures form an
integral part of the CS&S strategy and all
returned strong results. The performance of
Fleet Support Limited, in which BAE Systems
has a 50% interest, was particularly
encouraging following the signing of an 11
year partnering agreement at the UK’s
Portsmouth Naval base. BAE Systems 50%

In 2003, the CS&S business group made a
profit

of £411m (2002 £454m) on sales of
£2,166m (2002 £2,258m). The business
generated an operating cash inflow

of
£518m (2002 £323m).
BAE Systems has a major presence in the
Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, as prime contractor
for the UK’s government-to-government
defence agreement, Al Yamamah. The
business employs some 4,800 people, of
whom more than half are Saudi nationals, in
support of the Royal Saudi Air Force and the
Royal Saudi Navy. BAE Systems provides
complete support and service solutions,
including support to the Kingdom's ground
defence infrastructure and naval minehunters. 
Performance on the Al Yamamah programme
was strong, with cash flows benefiting from
the strong oil price throughout the year. 
Other overseas activities included receiving a
contract to supply the Royal Bahraini Air Force
with a complete solution for an indigenous
flying academy in Bahrain including the Hawk
Advanced Jet Trainer, and an order for the
reactivation, upgrade and transfer to Romania
of two Type 22 Frigates. 
The Customer Solutions & Support
(CS&S) business group provides tailored
through-life support and services for
current and future military capability. It
meets the trend within armed forces to
work more closely with industry to
ensure their front-line operational
requirements are supported and
maintained in the most cost-effective
and efficient manner.

interest in Flagship Training Limited, which
manages the Royal Naval training
establishments and markets their training
courses to overseas customers, also saw
encouraging growth in its order book.
Looking forward, CS&S will work to sustain a
long-term presence in Saudi Arabia, deliver on
schedule and further extend its current
support and service contracts, and position
itself as the key provider of through-life
support on major platforms such as Typhoon,
Astute, Type 45 and JSF. The announcements
in 2003 that BAE Systems has been selected
to provide Hawk Advanced Jet Trainers to both
the UK and India will also provide support
opportunities for these key programmes.
The strong oil price continues to benefit cash
flows while sales in 2004 are expected to be
at a comparable level with 2003. Margins are
likely to continue to trend downwards as more
work on the Al Yamamah programme is
undertaken in country and a greater
proportion of overall CS&S sales are
generated from UK activity.

effective operation in attractive markets.
Secondly, working with joint venture
management and our partners, to improve
operating margins.
The business group generated an operating
profit
2
of £65m (2002 loss £11m). Sales for
the continuing businesses grew by 12% to
£1.7bn. In sterling terms, sales and profits
benefited by the translation effect of a
strengthening Euro by £156m and £6m
respectively. The business group achieved
order intake of £2.3bn, an increase of 16% on
last year for the continuing businesses. Cash
generation was in line with operating profits.
The turnaround in profitability followed the
successful disposal of the 27.5% economic
interest in the loss-making Astrium space
systems business and improved performance
across all other International Partnership
businesses. In particular a strong second half
performance was delivered from MBDA and
AMS.  
Looking to 2004, further sales growth is
anticipated across International Partnerships
as a whole with margins continuing to improve.
Trading during 2004 is again expected to have
a bias to the second half.
MBDA
MBDA has seen strong profit growth in 2003
as a number of key programmes have moved
from development into production. Profitability
is also now starting to benefit from the
synergies of bringing UK, French and Italian
activities into a single joint venture.
Atlas Elektronik’s core skills are in the provision of
systems for the submarine, mine warfare and
surface combatant markets. For example, in the
submarine market, Atlas Elektronik provides an
integrated ‘sensor to shooter’ combat system
solution – from sensors, through command and
weapon control, and on to the design and
manufacture of torpedoes.
Overview
International Partnerships is responsible for
the group’s principal defence joint ventures in
Europe. There is a strong systems capability
with global market presence across all of
these businesses which are well positioned
across air, land and sea sectors. AMS’s core
technology is based around radar with that of
Atlas Elektronik around sonar. Both of these
businesses have in-depth system design,
development, production and integration skills.
MBDA designs and builds a wide range of
missiles for numerous platforms around the
world. It works closely with AMS on a number
of projects of which the Type 45 destroyer is a
good example. Over recent years, Saab has
successfully diversified from being
predominantly an aircraft manufacturer to a
business with a broad range of activities, again
heavily focused on the design and manufacture
of integrated defence systems.
During 2003, the group’s 49% interest in STN
Atlas GmbH was exchanged for a 100%
interest in the naval systems part of the
business, Atlas Elektronik GmbH. A smooth
transition into BAE Systems was achieved
following the business split, with the retained
business performing well throughout 2003. 
Also in 2003, progress continued with
Finmeccanica on a proposal to restructure the
avionics, C4ISR and communications
businesses of the respective UK and Italian
companies into three joint ventures, collectively
described as Eurosystems. 
International Partnerships business group
continued to focus on two key strategic areas
during 2003. Firstly, restructuring the group’s
portfolio of joint venture interests to ensure MBDA’s order book continued to grow during
2003 with a number of important orders
secured, including the contract from the
European procurement agency OCCAR
(Organisation Conjointe de Co-opération en
matière d’Armement) for series production of
the world’s first advanced ground and 
naval-based air defence system with an anti-
ballistic missile capability. The order covers
production of almost 1,400 Aster missiles
together with logistics support, associated
equipment and training for the UK, French and
Italian defence ministries. MBDA’s share of the
contract is valued at €2.3bn. 
MBDA is part of the team contracted by the UK
MoD to begin development of Phase 1 of a
Ground Based Air Defence (GBAD) programme.
Under the contract, the team will demonstrate
a new Air Defence Command and Control
System integrated with the MBDA Rapier FSC
air defence missile system and the Starstreak
High Velocity Missile, both currently in service
with the UK armed forces. The contract, which
is a competitive assessment phase and was
signed in December 2003, is initially worth
around £40m. After assessment, the next
phase of the programme is due to see a single
team down-selected for the main GBAD
programme, the budget for which has been
announced by the UK MoD as £1bn.
MBDA also successfully completed the
preliminary design review for Meteor, the 
six-nation Beyond Visual Range Air-to-Air
Missile, and work is now well advanced for the
first ground-based firing in a simulated flight
environment. This will lead to the first air
launched firing in 2005.
BAE SYSTEMS Annual report 2003 13
AMS
AMS had a year of strong profitable growth as
it started to deliver benefits of scale.
Order intake for 2003 was up on the previous
year and included a second contract, valued at
€150m, for further installation and integration
of the AMS combat system being supplied to
the new Italian aircraft carrier, Andrea Doria. 
AMS achieved important milestones with the
combat management systems for the UK Type
45 destroyer programme and also the
corresponding Franco/Italian Horizon destroyer
programme. During 2003, software
development on the data transfer systems for
both of these programmes successfully
passed contractual acceptance tests. 
Saab
Saab’s operating income in 2003 improved by
6% on 2002, after having recognised the cost
of rationalisation which will benefit the
business going forward.
Saab continues to grow, achieving order intake
in 2003 of SEK19.6bn (£1.5bn). This stems
from the development of advanced integrated
systems for the Swedish market whilst at the
same time increasing the proportion of export
activity in the business; export orders now
account for 65% of the order book.
Included in this order intake is the contract for
the proximity fuse for the first Meteor order
(SEK1.4bn (£0.1bn)) and a full business
agreement to supply the mid and outer fixed
leading edge on the A380 wing. 
Gripen International
During 2003, the Hungarian government
extended the proposed lease of Gripen fighters
from the Swedish government to 14 aircraft.
Modification of the aircraft to achieve full NATO
inter-operability is expected to involve work
worth more than £150m to Saab. In addition,
the Czech Republic has opened negotiations
with the Swedish government for the lease of
14 Gripen aircraft over 10 years and with
Gripen International for a related industrial
offset package.
The development of the Gripen aircraft to fulfil
the order for South Africa is on track for first
deliveries in 2007. Key prospects for the aircraft
include the current tender for new fighter aircraft
for the Brazilian Air Force.
Atlas Elektronik
Atlas Elektronik had a good year, delivering a
strong profit and cash performance, whilst
undergoing key changes to the business
following its separation from STN Atlas. The
company’s good performance in 2003
maintains the steady recovery seen since
1999.
In December 2003, Atlas Elektronik’s new
generation heavyweight torpedo, DM2A4,
successfully completed its in-water test firing
ahead of contract award for series production.
Atlas Elektronik also cleared key acceptance
testing on its ISUS 90 submarine system for
the Turkish, Greek and South African navies
during the course of 2003.
In addition to its core combat systems
business, Atlas Elektronik has been successful
in exporting technology to adjacent military and
commercial maritime markets; notable
examples include worldwide sales of its Vessel
Traffic Services systems and its hydrographic
systems.

missiles) will be defeated by the Principal Anti-Air Missile Systems (PAAMS) to be
fitted in the new UK, French and Italian destroyer programmes. MBDA and AMS are
working closely on the UK Type 45 and French/Italian Horizon destroyer programmes.
The result will be a fully integrated system comprising command and control, sensors
and missiles to provide an all-round multi-layer defence for naval task forces and
associated shipping.
Saab – sales by business areas

Command, Control, Communication and Intelligence
(left to right) Avionics is a major supplier of 
equipment for helicopter programmes, Compact
Antenna Test Range, helmet mounted displays and
Captor multi-mode radar.
In 2003, the Avionics business group made
a profit
2
of £12m (2002 £66m) on sales of
£1,127m (2002 £1,085m). The business
had an operating cash outflow
3
of £28m
(2002 inflow £83m). 
Avionics group results in 2003 were
adversely impacted by rationalisation costs
of £30m, which mainly addressed the
reduced throughput in its inertial systems
activities for the automotive industry.
Avionics is a major supplier of systems to
the four partner nations on the Typhoon
programme. These include two principal
sub-systems, the Captor multi-mode radar
and the Defensive Aids Sub-System (DASS).
Deliveries of Captor radar systems were
evenly spread across the year but there
was a lower than planned build up of DASS
equipment deliveries in the second half of
2003, with consequential impact on sales
and profit.
Investment continued in the sensor
systems business at Basildon and
Edinburgh in the UK, resulting in the
creation of world class centres of
excellence in radar and electro-optical
technologies. Amongst their successes was
the receipt of the contract from Lockheed
Martin for the laser system for the 
Electro-Optical Targeting System for the JSF.
This award highlights the position of the
Edinburgh facility as a world leading laser
designer and supplier to the international
market. 
  BAE SYSTEMS Annual report 2003 15
The electronic warfare business within
Avionics is also a major supplier of
equipment for helicopter programmes. The
Helicopter Integrated Defensive Aids
System (HIDAS) was specified by the
Kuwaiti and Greek governments for their
Apache helicopters, establishing HIDAS as
the system of choice for international
customers of the Boeing AH-64 Apache
Longbow attack helicopter.  
In addition to such new platform
programmes, Avionics is pursuing
significant market opportunities to upgrade
other helicopter platforms. Most notably,
such opportunities exist where central
European and emerging NATO countries
look to bring equipment to NATO compliant
standards.
During 2003, the DLH (Siren) shipborne
decoy system and HALO artillery locating
system were accepted into service by the
MoD. Both systems are now generating
interest in the export market.
The Australian part of the group was
selected early in 2003 by the Australian
government for the Advanced SATCOM
Terrestrial Infrastructure System. This
reinforces its position as the leading
domiciled C3I
6
business in Australia. Other
Australian successes include the customer
acceptance into service of JORN (an
over-the-horizon radar) and WAPS (an
integrated communications suite for the
Western Australian Police Service).
The avionic systems business is a leading
supplier of controls, display systems and
mission computers for military and
commercial aircraft. Aircraft supplied
include JSF, Typhoon, Tornado, Hawk, F-16,
both Boeing and Airbus commercial
airliners, and EH101 and Lynx helicopters. 
The Avionics group’s award winning helmet
mounted displays technology supports a
range of aircraft including Typhoon, Gripen
and JSF as well as helicopters such as the
Eurocopter Tiger and WAH-64.
The outlook for Avionics remains good, with
many state of the art technologies coming
to the market in targeting systems, control
and display systems, land vehicle vision
systems, and electronic warfare and
countermeasures. All of these represent
key technologies for the future battlespace
and emerging requirements for homeland
defence.
Sales growth is expected in 2004 when
compared with 2003 and margins are
anticipated to make a progressive recovery.
Sales and, hence, margins will be biased
towards the second half. North America
The North America business group

2003 was another successful year for the
North America business as it continued to
grow and expand its core leadership positions
in aerospace and defence electronics, C4ISR,
and technical services.
The business produced good, sustainable
growth in the US which continues to be the
engine of the global defence market. The two
acquisitions made early in the year, APTI and
MEVATEC, also performed well. Strong
programme performance enabled the
business to produce year on year sales
growth at constant exchange rates of 12%
(11% growth at constant rates before
acquisitions) with 9% return on sales. In
sterling terms, sales and profits were reduced
by the translation effect of the weakening
dollar by £237m and £21m respectively.
BAE Systems is a major supplier of electronic
systems for the JSF. BAE Systems
participation on the programme in North
America includes the integrated electronic
combat/electronic warfare suite and the
vehicle management computer, and elements
of the communications, navigation and
identification suite systems. In 2003, the JSF
electronic warfare system development and
demonstration programme successfully
completed its preliminary design review, met
or exceeded technical and programme
allocation requirements, and delivered the
first sets of contractual aperture hardware.
For its contribution to the JSF programme,
which included design refinements leading to
significant savings, the business earned its
fourth consecutive ‘Best in Class’ award fee
from Lockheed Martin. In 2004, the company
will build on its 2003 accomplishments by
completing system critical design reviews,
delivering electronic hardware to the
integration laboratory and beginning
countermeasure development testing.
BAE Systems North America’s growing
capability in C4ISR and tactical
communications is exemplified by its
selection in 2003 to develop the integrated
air and ground communications suite for the
transformational Future Combat System
(FCS), the US Army’s largest acquisition
programme. The company’s development of
the Wolfpack networked sensor and
communications system for the Defense
Advanced Research Projects Agency offers
the potential to revolutionise electronic
warfare and illustrates BAE Systems domain
expertise in communications, sensor and
jamming technology.  
BAE Systems North America is developing a
strong position as a C4ISR systems and 
sub-systems integrator focused on solving the
growing challenges in command and control,
time-critical-targeting, precision engagement,
and battlefield management. In 2003, the
business was down-selected in partnership
with General Dynamics to compete for the
Warfighter Information Network-Tactical
(WIN-T), and also delivered several key
programme wins in geospatial imagery and
systems integration. This is after the 2002
Joint Tactical Radio System (JTRS) and
Adaptive Joint C4ISR Node (AJCN) wins. 
(above) BAE Systems has grown to become the
largest avionics supplier for the USAF C-17.

  BAE SYSTEMS Annual report 2003 17
Already recognised as a worldwide leader in
electronic warfare and electronic attack,
BAE Systems North America captured the
systems integrator role for the USAF
Compass Call programme. BAE Systems has
delivered more infra-red countermeasures
than any other company in the world and is
now working with the US Department of
Homeland Security to leverage its expertise
to develop systems for protecting commercial
aircraft from the growing threat from 
shoulder-launched anti-aircraft missiles.
The newly formed platform solutions sector,
which focuses the company’s capabilities in
flight and engine controls, power-management
technology, avionics, and inertial products,
achieved several significant milestones in
2003. These included new contracts for
avionics and flight control components on the
USAF C-17 and flight control systems for the
first flights of the BA 609 Tiltrotor and
Embraer AL-X aircraft. In addition, the
business was selected as Sikorsky’s
preferred supplier of fly-by-wire flight controls,
including sub-systems for the S-92 and H-92
helicopters.  
In the technology services arena,
BAE Systems remains one of the largest
suppliers of technical services and solutions
to the US Navy. In 2003, the group won 
follow-on contracts to manage the Holston
Army ammunition plant for an additional five
years, and to continue to provide
management and financial services for the
Federal Aviation Administration. In addition,
the group maintains a range of systems
engineering and technical assistance support
contracts across all branches of the US
military and several government agencies.
The acquisition of MEVATEC extended the
group’s reach into missile defence.
In 2003, the mission solutions and integrated
systems divisions earned the 
Level 5 Capability Maturity Model Integration
(CMMI) rating by the Software Engineering
Institute (SEI). Level 5 is the highest SEI
rating, indicating that the two business units
are operating at the ‘optimising level’ in their
systems and software development
processes, an achievement matched by fewer
than 20 companies worldwide. With this
recognition, more than 60% of BAE Systems
North America’s software engineers are now
operating at levels 4 and 5, a significant
differentiator in the aerospace and defence
industry.
BAE Systems North America targets organic
growth of 10% with margins staying around
the current level. The business has
historically converted much of its operating
profit into cash and this is expected to
continue.

Overview
The Commercial Aerospace business group
made a profit
2
of £204m (2002 £195m) on
sales of £2,924m (2002 £2,773m). Airbus
contributed a profit
2
of £211m (2002 £201m)
on sales of £2,683m (2002 £2,491m). This
was after charging £252m of development
costs (2002 £211m), of which £150m (2002
£103m) related to the A380 programme. In
sterling terms, sales and profit of Airbus
benefited by the translation effect of a
strengthening Euro by £246m and £19m
respectively.
The operating cash outflow
3
of £143m (2002
outflow £396m) includes £203m outflow in
regional aircraft, mainly relating to prior year
provision utilisation, offset by a strong cash
performance in Airbus. The performance at
Airbus reflects a lower than anticipated
impact from manufacturer’s sales finance for
airline customers. 
Airbus
Airbus enjoyed a successful year despite a
commercial aerospace market adversely
impacted by the Iraq conflict and the SARS
virus. Against this backdrop, it secured net
orders for 254 commercial aircraft in addition
to securing the strategically important A400M
military transport aircraft order for 180
aircraft. This market performance favourably
compares with the 233 aircraft orders
secured in 2002, particularly given the
commercial aircraft market conditions.
For the first time, Airbus achieved more than
50% of the worldwide deliveries of large
commercial jet aircraft, underlining the
strength of the business and its product
portfolio. Airbus achieved 305 commercial
aircraft deliveries during 2003, in line with
the previous year's performance.
The A380 development programme
progressed to plan with strong market
demand. All of the 11 customers who made
initial commitments for the A380 have now
signed firm purchase contracts, with
Emirates, Malaysian Airlines, Korean Air and
Qatar Airways all signing firm contracts during
2003. The firm order book for A380 stood at
129 at the end of 2003. 
2004 is expected to be a difficult year with
the commercial aircraft market likely to
remain depressed. The performance of Airbus
in 2004 is expected to reflect a slightly lower
value mix of deliveries and the results will be
impacted by a reduced benefit from hedge
book fair value provisions. The prospects for
Airbus in the medium-term remain bright.
Aerostructures
BAE Systems aerostructures business
performance in 2003 reflected the backdrop
of the difficult trading conditions in the
commercial aircraft market. A loss was
reported in 2003 as product development on
the A380 programme was expensed.
Regional Aircraft
During 2003, the regional aircraft business
finalised its transition to a customer support
and services operation.

Future Carrier 
At the beginning of 2003, the UK government
announced the selection of a three-way
alliance between BAE Systems, as preferred
prime contractor, Thales UK and the MoD to
build the Royal Navy’s two new aircraft
carriers. In March, BAE Systems and Thales
signed an interim alliance agreement, which
outlined the way forward for stage 3 of the
assessment phase. 
Work continues to balance the cost, capability
and programme delivery requirements of the
Carrier design prior to an anticipated contract
award.
RO Defence
RO Defence had a successful year. The
business saw its order book grow, with a
continued strong order intake in its
ammunitions supply activities and contract
wins such as that for low rate production
from the US Department of Defense for its
BROACH warhead system, to be fitted to the
US Navy’s Joint Standoff Weapon (JSOW-C). 
The M-777 lightweight howitzer programme
for the US Marine Corps and US Army met all
its milestones in 2003 with first production
equipment on schedule for delivery in early
2004. The Terrier next generation 
air-transportable armoured combat
engineering vehicle programme for the UK
MoD also achieved all milestones in 2003.

  Financial review
Profit before interest
1
reduced to £980m from
£1,002m in 2002, on sales of £12,572m
(2002 £12,145m). Earnings per share
1
for
2003 were down by 4% to 16.6p compared to
2002.
On a reported basis, the loss per share, after
preference dividends, was 0.5p compared
with a loss per share of 23.2p in 2002. This
was due to a lower goodwill amortisation and
impairment charge of £518m compared with
£615m (including impairment on joint
ventures of £117m) in 2002 and a
significantly reduced level of exceptional
items of £9m compared with £797m in
2002.
On translation the strength of the Euro more
than offset the weakening dollar and reported
sales and profit increased by £165m and
£4m respectively.
Interest
The net interest charge increased to £220m
from £206m in 2002. This reflected lower net
interest payable on loans, overdrafts and
financial instruments of £122m (2002
£155m) due to lower gross borrowings when
compared with 2002 and net present value
adjustments on aircraft lease provisions of
£41m (2002 £39m) and other net present
value adjustments of £7m (2002 £nil). There
was also a charge of £24m (2002 £nil)
relating to an adjustment to aircraft financing
liabilities due to changes in the expected
timing of receipts and payments. Share of net
interest of joint ventures was £26m (2002
£12m). Interest was covered 4.5 times by
earnings
1
(2002 4.9 times).

Taxation
The group’s underlying tax rate for the year
was 30% (2002 31%) and is expected to
remain the same in the medium-term.
Dividend
The Board is recommending a final dividend
of 5.5p per share (2002 5.5p), bringing the
total dividend for the year to 9.2p (2002
9.2p). At this level the annual dividend is
covered 1.8 times by earnings
1
(2002 1.9
times). The dividend policy is to maintain the
dividend in line with earnings with a long-term
objective of dividend cover above 2 times.
Other recognised gains and losses
Other recognised gains and losses include an
exchange translation loss of £93m (2002
£92m) primarily due to weakening of the US
dollar on the net US dollar assets in
subsidiaries and an exchange translation gain
of £181m (2002 £192m) in joint ventures.
This relates to the translation loss on
underlying Euro assets offset by a translation
gain on underlying US dollar liabilities in joint
ventures, primarily Airbus.
Cash flows
Operating cash inflow was £836m (2002
£136m). A reconciliation of operating cash
flow to business group cash flow is shown
above. Capital expenditure and financial
investment was £248m (2002 £183m). The
increase was primarily due to the investment
of £74m in Alvis plc, representing a 29%
interest. 
Operating business cash inflow
2
was £625m
compared with £31m in 2002. Cash flow
improvements were achieved at Programmes
as customer stage payments mitigated an
outflow on Nimrod and capital expenditure on
the JSF programme and also at CS&S due to
the benefit of the high oil price during 2003.
Commercial Aerospace included an outflow on
the regional aircraft recourse provision,
partially offset by a strong cash performance
in Airbus compared with 2002 despite
product development and capital expenditure
on the A380 programme. North America cash
flow was strong with some increase in
working capital. Avionics cash outflows were
mainly caused by rationalisation costs and
capital expenditure on the new EW facility.
Free cash inflow, after interest and preference
dividends and taxation, was £562m
compared with an outflow of £229m in 2002,
from which equity dividends of £281m are
paid.
Cash outflow on acquisitions of £62m relates
primarily to the purchase of APTI and
MEVATEC during 2003.
There was a benefit to net debt of £121m as
Vodafone shares, underlying the Exchange
Property, were revalued to market value at
31 December 2003. Foreign currency
translation of £72m primarily comprises the
benefit of translating US dollar denominated
debt at the closing rate of £1/$1.786.
At the end of the year the net debt was
£870m (2002 £1,298m).
Liquidity
As at 31 December 2003 the group had
gross borrowings of £2,528m (2002
£2,983m), cash and current asset
investments of £1,663m (2002 £1,706m)
and cash on customers’ account of £5m
(2002 £21m) giving a net debt of £870m
(2002 £1,298m). During 2003, the gross
borrowings figure peaked at just below £3bn
in the first quarter of the year before reducing
as a result of improved business cash flow
producing lower levels of outstanding US
dollar commercial paper, capital repayments
falling due and favourable currency
movements on US dollar denominated debt. 
In addition to its outstanding borrowings the
group has committed revolving credit facilities
(RCF) of £2bn available to it to meet any
general corporate funding requirement and
support the commercial paper programme.
These comprise a £1.5bn five-year RCF
completed during 2003 with the group’s core
relationship banks and a £500m RCF which
matures in 2005. At the end of 2003 neither
of these facilities was drawn.
Generally, the net debt of the group is driven
by operational performance, the level of
receipts on the major contracts and the
performance of the joint ventures. As a result
of major contract milestones historically
falling towards the end of accounting periods,
the net debt of the group is usually at its
lowest position at the half and full year.

Operating business cash flow 625 31 Capital structure
The group funds its operations through a
mixture of shareholders’ funds and borrowing
facilities, including bank and capital market
borrowings.
All the group’s material borrowing facilities
are arranged by the central treasury function
and funds raised are lent onward to operating
subsidiaries as required. The group’s
objective is to ensure the continuity of
competitively priced funding through
borrowing from a range of markets and at
varied maturities.
Details of the group’s debt, including the
Exchangeable Bonds, are included in note 16
to the accounts. During 2003, £208m of 
long-term debt was repaid relating to the
Capital Amortising Loan Stock, European
Investment Bank loan and the Systems 2001
Asset Trust bonds. While commercial paper
levels fluctuated to meet short-term liquidity
requirements, at the end of 2003 they had
reduced by £176m in the year. No new long
or medium-term debt was raised in 2003,
although it remains the group’s intention to
ensure the business is funded conservatively
and to be opportunistic in accessing the bank
and capital markets in achieving this aim.
Interest rates 
The objective of interest rate risk
management is to reduce the exposure to
interest rate fluctuations on borrowings and
deposits. This is achieved through varying the
proportion of fixed rate debt relative to
floating rate debt over the forward time
horizon by utilising derivative instruments,
mainly interest rate swaps. The interest rate
risk profile of the group is set out in note 30
to the accounts along with the fair value
position of its fixed rate borrowings and
derivatives. The group’s current interest rate
management policy is that a minimum of 25%
and a maximum of 75% of debt is maintained
at fixed interest rates. At 31 December 2003,
the group had 57% of fixed debt and 43% of
floating rate debt. The group’s gross debt,
after the impact of foreign currency swaps,
was 75% denominated in sterling and 25%
denominated in US dollars.
The floating rate debt has been predominantly
achieved by entering into interest rate swaps
which swap the fixed rate US dollar interest
payable on debt into either floating rate
sterling or US dollars. At the end of 2003, the
group had a total of $1.6bn of this type of
swap outstanding with an average duration of
6 years. In respect of the fixed rate sterling
debt the weighted average period in respect
of which interest is fixed was 8 years.
Given the level of short-term interest rates
during the year the average cost of the
floating rate debt was 3.6% (2.8% on US
dollars and 4.7% on sterling); the cost of the
sterling fixed rate debt was 6.7%. 
In respect of cash deposits, given the
fluctuation in the group’s working capital
requirements, cash is generally invested for
short-term periods based at floating interest
rates. Given a 1% change in short-term rates
and the existing fixed/floating mix and level
of borrowings, the interest cost to the group
on its gross debt would have varied by £12m.

(right) Bob Guyer, from informaton and electronic warfare systems, Nashua USA, won a Chairman’s
Gold Award for Innovation for his work in fovial optics. This allows the DIRCM (Directed Infra-Red
Countermeasures) system to track targets with fewer optical elements, reducing costs and 
improving reliability. Foreign exchange risk
The group is exposed to movements in
exchange rates for foreign currency
denominated transactions, the translation of
net assets and the translation of profit and
loss accounts of foreign subsidiaries and
joint ventures.
Under the group’s foreign exchange policy,
firm transactional and anticipated foreign
currency cash flow hedging is managed over a
five year period, having first matched receipts
and payments. The consequence of this
policy has been to maintain a relatively stable
long-term exchange rate.
The group is exposed to a number of foreign
currencies, the most significant being the US
dollar. Note 30 to the accounts, on financial
instruments, includes the impact of revaluing
the group’s forward currency contracts to
market values on 31 December 2003. This
revaluation would have a minimal impact on
the results of the group as any gains and
losses are generally offset by the position on
the underlying currency flow.
The group does not hedge the translation
effect of exchange rate movements on the
profit and loss account or balance sheet of
overseas subsidiaries and joint ventures it
regards as long-term investments. Hedges
are however undertaken in respect of
investments which are not considered long-
term or core to the group.
Commercial aircraft financing provision
The group provides guarantees in respect of
residual values or head lease and finance
BAE SYSTEMS Annual report 2003 23
payments in respect of certain commercial
aircraft sold. Details are set out in note 20 to
the accounts.
Insurance
The group operates a policy of partial self
insurance, although the significant majority of
cover is placed in the external market. The
group continues to monitor its insurance
arrangements to ensure the quality and
extent of the insurance cover. 
FRS 17
The group has continued to account for
retirement benefits under SSAP 24. The
pension charge for the year on UK and US
defined benefit schemes, excluding the
group’s share of pension costs charged by
joint venture companies, on a SSAP 24 basis
was £127m (2002 £118m). The disclosures
required under the accounting standard
FRS 17 are set out in note 27 to the
accounts. FRS 17 requires the group to
calculate its net pension liabilities, valuing
assets and liabilities at a point in time rather
than matching expectations of assets and
liabilities over time. The deficit on UK and US
schemes calculated on an FRS 17 basis was
£2.1bn after tax (2002 £2.2bn after tax).
Investment returns, better than expected by
£827m, were partially offset by an increase in
liabilities due to a reduction in the discount
rate during the year. 
Full adoption of FRS 17 would have resulted
in an additional charge to operating profit of
£45m (2002 £58m) when compared with the
pension charge on a SSAP 24 basis, and
reserves would have been reduced by £2.4bn
(2002 £2.4bn).
The FRS 17 assessment has no impact on
short-term cash contributions to the pension
schemes. The group’s pension funding
requirements are derived from separate
independent actuarial valuations. In order to
help mitigate future pension cost increases,
the company has introduced changes to its
main UK and US pension schemes. These
changes include an agreement to increase
employees’ contributions to the main scheme
in the UK and to establish employee
contributions for much of the US workforce. In
addition, the company has made a 
pre-payment of $60m to its US scheme in
December 2003.
Accounting policy changes
The group has adopted the requirements of
Urgent Issues Task Force Abstract 38 -
Accounting for ESOP trusts and the
application note to FRS 5 on revenue
recognition. These have not impacted the
profit for the year as explained in note 1 to
the accounts.
International Accounting Standards
The group is currently undertaking a review of
the impact of the change to International
Accounting Standards which all publicly listed
companies in the EU are required to adopt
from 2005. There is still uncertainty as to the
final standards which will be applicable at
transition but these are expected to be
confirmed by 31 March 2004. The current
plans indicate that the group is well placed to
comply with International Accounting
Standards in line with the requirements.

  100 years of flight
24 BAE SYSTEMS Annual report 2003
2003 marked the 100th anniversary of the
first powered flight by the Wright brothers
on 17 December 1903. The heritage of
BAE Systems
in aviation
dates back
almost as far,
beginning with
the creation of
the company
A.V. Roe and
Co. in
Manchester in
1910. Other
great aviation
pioneers at the time included Blackburn,
de Havilland, Sopwith and Hawker. From
their dreams and aspirations evolved
British Aircraft Corporation, Hawker
Siddeley Aviation, Hawker Siddeley
Dynamics and Scottish Aviation, the
companies that merged in 1977 to form
British Aerospace. In 1981, British
Aerospace was privatised setting the
course for today’s BAE Systems; formed in
1999 and now one of the main global
players in the aerospace industry. 
Today, the manufacture of complete aircraft
is concentrated in northern England.
Warton in Lancashire is Europe’s premier
flight test facility and is responsible for
operating major programmes including
Typhoon, Nimrod, Tornado, Harrier and
Hawk. These programmes, together with
our commercial interests in Airbus, will
help ensure that BAE Systems retains its
strong aviation identity as the next 100
years unfold.
To mark our own heritage and recognising
it as the basis of our aviation future we
were delighted to be a foundation sponsor
of the Royal Aeronautical Society’s 100
Years of Flight programme. The emphasis
of the year-long programme of events was
not only to celebrate the achievements in
aerospace over the last 100 years, but
also to communicate the importance of
aviation, the challenges that lie ahead and
to inspire a new generation to take up
careers in the aerospace industry.
In addition to providing support to national
events we have also encouraged local
initiatives to mark the centenary year;
these include our ongoing Engineering the
Future programme in the UK aimed at
encouraging school children to develop an
interest in aeronautical engineering.
In the US we sponsored numerous
celebrations to mark the centenary
including support for a celebration flight at
Kitty Hawk of an exact replica of the Wright
brothers’ original aeroplane. One of our
employees, Larry Parks, participated in the
construction of the plane, using original
tools to recreate the authentic detail such
as a hand-carved propeller. 
On 17 December 2003, the actual
anniversary of the 100 Years of Flight, a
wing of six de Havilland Tiger Moths flew in
formation over the Farnborough airfield to
commemorate the occasion. The
significance of the flight over Farnborough
is that it was here in 1908 that Samuel
Franklin Cody made the first officially
recognised flight of a heavier than air
machine in Britain.
‘2003 is not only the end of a century of
accomplishment but also the start of a new
century of challenge and achievement.’
Royal Aeronautical Society BAE SYSTEMS Annual report 2003 25
Managing our corporate responsibilities for the
benefit of all our stakeholders remains core to
the ongoing operation of BAE Systems.  
In 2003, we continued our programme of
socially responsible engagement and
communication across all areas of our
corporate social responsibility (CSR) agenda;
marketplace, workplace, community and
environment. A full report on our CSR activities
during 2003 will be available from May 2004
on the company’s website at
www.baesystems.com.
During 2003, we became the
first defence company to be
included in the Dow Jones
Sustainability Index (DJSI). The
DJSI is the most widely
recognised index of sustainable industries and
our inclusion reflects the progress we have
made in communicating the level of corporate
governance and responsible practices to which
we adhere. 
We also participated in the first Corporate
Responsibility Index launched by Business in
the Community in the UK in 2003. More than
160 of the FTSE 250 companies participated
and we were ranked in the 2nd quintile, which
we consider to be a fair reflection of the
progress we have made and the improvements
we still need to make.
BAE Systems recognises the importance of
transparency in all its activities and
encourages employees to feedback or raise
concerns. Our ethics hotline is now fully
established in both the UK and US. The nature
of the calls received primarily related to human
resources and grievance procedures. We are
intending to introduce the hotline to Australia
and our other operations in 2004.
Education
We recognise that our responsibilities extend
externally as well as internally. The aims of our
education strategy underpin the common goal
in education to raise standards and offer
young people the best opportunities to
succeed. These aims are:
• to provide an informed view of the modern
engineering process in BAE Systems so that
young people can make an informed career
choice;
• to involve BAE Systems employees in
planned, structured development
opportunities;
• to develop a sense of pride in BAE Systems
in our employees and the communities in
which we reside; and 
• to further our partnership with governments. 
Our education strategy involves our employees
and sites both at local and national level
across the world:
• in Australia, BAE Systems was the major
sponsor of South Australia’s Engineering
Week which encourages and inspires young
people to get involved in the field of
engineering;
• in North America, BAE Systems supports
FIRST: For Inspiration and Recognition of
Science and Technology. The goal of FIRST is
continually to interest and excite new
generations of students about science and
technology. FIRST efforts are team efforts,
involving students, teachers, communities,
corporations and the government to build
self-confidence, knowledge and life skills
while motivating young people to pursue
opportunities in science and engineering.
BAE Systems participates in FIRST with
teams of high school students from districts
near BAE Systems offices across the nation,
as well as providing primary sponsorship for
the FIRST programme in the northeast US;
• in the UK our Schools Network programme
has over 1,500 schools across the country
registered with it. This gives schools access
to engineering and science projects in which
they can take part. We also play an active
role in the UK government’s Specialist
Schools programme.
Our chief executive, Mike Turner, is part of the
UK National Modern Apprenticeship Task
Force, which is a key strand of the
government’s strategy to build the skills base
in this country. As an employer of over 1,000
apprentices in the UK alone, BAE Systems is
fully committed to the creation of opportunities
and delivery of training. We were delighted that
one of our apprentices in Lancashire, Grace
Johnstone, was recently recognised as the
UK’s Young Woman Engineer of the Year.
This year has seen a number of changes to
the training and development programme for
apprentices in our naval ships business. Our
human resources team worked together with
local colleges to set up a programme to
support our apprentices.
Corporate social responsibility
Following the successful recruitment of 112
apprentices, the largest group of apprentices seen in
recent years, by our naval ships business, we were
awarded the Ron Taylor Award for Quality in Training
Delivery which was sponsored by Scottish Enterprise.
Grace Johnstone, UK Young Woman
Engineer of the Year. 
  26 BAE SYSTEMS Annual report 2003
Recognition
Our Chairman’s Award scheme recognises
people whose ideas, actions and behaviours
make BAE Systems a better, more competitive
company and help us to live up to our values.
Over 3,000 nominations were received into the
scheme this year. From those, 46 silver awards
were allocated across the three categories of
Innovation, Implementation and Community
Awards. The best of these nominations were
considered for gold awards by a panel of
judges chaired by Ian King, group managing
director of our CS&S business, and involving
Sir Keith O’Nions, Chief Scientific Officer of the
MoD, and David Hughes, Director General of
the Innovations Group of the UK Department of
Trade and Industry.
The Chairman’s Community Award was
presented to Paul Dugan who identified a need
within the Saudi capital’s English-speaking
schools – namely that there was no provision
for children with special needs. He developed
a self-financing business plan, obtained
authority from the Saudi government and then
founded the Riyadh Multinational school, which
provides learning assistance for special needs
students. The school now has 400 students,
and this is expected to double by 2006. This
has made a real difference to those young
people who rely on special education to help
them overcome their difficulties.
Health and safety
The safety of our products is of paramount
importance to those who use them; equally
important is the creation of a safe working
environment in our workplace. Our statistics
show that through increased awareness
training and focus on specific issues, our
performance in this area continues to improve,
to the benefit of all. In recognition of our
ongoing commitment to safety improvements,
our main explosives filling site at Glascoed in
Wales was awarded the ROSPA Gold Award for
Health and Safety for the fourth consecutive
year.
As part of the UK government’s commitment to
revitalising health and safety, we have agreed a
partnership programme for 2004 with the UK
Health & Safety Executive to look at some
specific areas of workplace safety. 
BAE Systems in the Community
Charity Challenge is a programme which covers all employee-driven charitable activity across
BAE Systems. 
Operating for more than ten years, Charity Challenge has grown to cover five countries and
more than 100 sites across both BAE Systems and our joint ventures including Airbus,
AMS, MBDA and Xchanging HR Services. 
The 2003 Charity Challenge campaign raised £5.7million and reported 3,500 volunteer
days for charities worldwide. 
The partnership charities selected by employees for the 2004 Charity Challenge campaign
are the American Cancer Society (North America), National Children’s Homes (UK), Help the
Hospices (Germany) and the Cancer Council (Australia). In addition to these specific
charities, employees are encouraged to engage in charitable and community programmes
wherever they are in the world. This includes the Sharek Al Khair programme in Saudi
Arabia which encourages our employees to donate their time and energy for the benefit of
those less fortunate than themselves.

Gold Community Award, at the Riyadh
Multinational school. BAE SYSTEMS Annual report 2003 27
Our information and electronic warfare systems
division received the American College of
Occupational and Environmental Medicine’s
(ACOEM) 2003 Corporate Health Achievement
Award. The award recognises achievements
focusing on employee health, safety and
environmental management, particularly
innovative health and safety programmes.
ACOEM cited the BAE Systems unit’s efforts in
two areas: its comprehensive programme to
reduce cumulative trauma disorder injuries;
and the chemical and materials safety
programme. 
Environment
As the geographical spread of our business
increases, it is ever more important that we
are cognisant of the surrounding environment
and the potential impact our operations may
have. We continued to pursue our aim to have
all of our major manufacturing sites accredited
to the international environmental
management standard, ISO 14001, and only
Barrow in the UK has yet to achieve this.
Recognising our contribution to global issues
such as emissions of greenhouse gases (in
particular carbon dioxide associated with
energy usage) we have continued to focus on
this through 2003. An overall reduction of
20%, compared with 2002, in carbon dioxide
equivalents across our world-wide operations
was achieved. 
BAE Systems is sponsoring a three year twinning arrangement for two special needs schools
based in Blackpool and Singapore. The annual exchange programme will offer both
organisations opportunities to exchange new and innovative training methods and share training
experiences.

The group operates a centralised treasury
department that is accountable to the TRMC
for managing treasury activities in accordance
with the framework of treasury policies and
guidelines approved by the Board. An
overriding policy is that trading in financial
instruments for the purpose of profit
generation is prohibited, with all financial
instruments being used for risk management
purposes. Other key policies are:
• to maintain a balance between continuity
of funding and flexibility through the use of
borrowings with a range of maturities,
currencies and fixed/floating rates of
interest reflecting the group risk profile;
• to maintain adequate undrawn committed
borrowing facilities;
• to mitigate the exposure to interest rate
fluctuations on borrowings and deposits by
utilising interest rate swaps, interest rate
options and forward rate agreements; and
• to hedge economically both contracted
and anticipated foreign currency cash
flows over a five-year period, having first
matched receipts and payments.
Within this policy framework the treasury
department’s principal responsibilities are:
• to manage the group’s core funding and
liquidity;
• to manage exposure to interest rate
movements;
• to manage exposure to foreign currency
movements; 
• to control and monitor bank credit risk and
credit capacity utilisation; and
• to manage the group’s relationship with
debt capital market investors, banks and
rating agencies.
The treasury department transacts with an
extensive range of counter-party banks and
financial institutions and adopts a systematic
approach to the control and monitoring of
counter-party credit risk. A credit limit is
allocated to each counterparty with reference
to its relevant credit rating. For internal credit
risk purposes, all transactions are marked-to-
market and the resultant exposure is
allocated against the credit limit.
The company, through its internal audit
department, monitors compliance against the
principal policies and guidelines (including the
utilisation of credit) and any exceptions found
are reported to the TRMC. Further disclosure
on financial instruments is set out in note 30
to the accounts.
Supplier payment policy
It is group policy that each business unit is in
compliance with local best practice in the
country of operation in respect of supplier
payment policies. Agreed payment schedules
are maintained provided that the supplier
complies with all relevant terms and
conditions. Group policy is that changes to
the agreed payment schedule are only made
with the prior agreement of the supplier.
The average number of days credit provided in
2003 by suppliers to the group was 37 days
(2002 38 days). 
Employment
The group has a programme in place to
assist employees to achieve their full
potential and to develop the skills necessary
to meet the current and future expectations
of our customers. The programme focuses on
both personal and technological development. 
All employment policies include a
commitment to equal opportunities
regardless of sex, race, colour, nationality,
ethnic origin, religion, age or disability, subject
only to considerations of national security.
The company’s policy is to provide, wherever
possible, employment opportunities for
disabled people and to ensure that disabled
people joining the company and employees
who become disabled whilst in our
employment benefit from training and career
development opportunities.
The company has put into place a number of
ways of consulting with employees and
providing them with information on the
performance of the company and other
matters that affect them. The effectiveness of
the communication process is assessed
regularly with the aim of ensuring continual
improvement so as to provide employees with
the information they want by the most
effective means.
Employees are actively encouraged to
become shareholders in the company by way
of SAYE share option schemes. Currently
around 32,000 employees participate in the
company and joint venture SAYE share option
schemes.
The directors of BAE Systems present their
report, together with the accounts, for the
year ended 31 December 2003.
Principal activities
BAE Systems is a company engaged in the
development, delivery and support of
advanced defence and aerospace systems in
the air, on land, at sea and in space. The
company designs, manufactures and supports
military aircraft, surface ships, submarines,
radar, avionics, communications, electronics
and guided weapon systems. Further details
of the principal activities of the company and
likely future developments in the business are
set out in the chief executive’s review and
operating and financial review on pages 4
to 23.
Research and technology
The company makes significant investment in
research and technology in all the main areas
of its business and in its own corporate
research centre. Emphasis is increasingly
being placed on exploiting the UK’s strong
science base through the University
Partnerships programme and the Systems
Engineering Innovation Centre formed in
partnership with Loughborough University. The
emphasis of the research programme is being
directed increasingly at the development of
the company’s systems and sub-systems
capabilities that relate to the evolving
requirements of the defence customer base.
Note 3 to the accounts details the amounts
spent on research and development in 2003.
Office of Fair Trading undertakings
As a consequence of the merger between
British Aerospace and the former GEC
Marconi Electronic Systems businesses in
1999, the company is required to comply with
certain undertakings given to the Secretary of
State for Trade and Industry. Compliance with
the undertakings is monitored by an
independent compliance officer. Further
information regarding the undertakings and
the contact details of the compliance officer
may be obtained through the company
secretary at the company's registered office.
Corporate governance
The corporate governance statement is set
out on pages 32 to 35.
Treasury policy
The group’s treasury activities are overseen
by the Treasury Review Management
Committee (TRMC). Two executive directors
are members of the TRMC, including the
group finance director who chairs the
committee. The TRMC also has
representatives with legal and taxation
expertise. 
Directors’ report
  BAE SYSTEMS Annual report 2003 31
Results and dividends
The profit after taxation and minority interests
was £6m (2002 loss £686m). The directors
propose a final dividend of 5.5p per ordinary
share (2002 5.5p), amounting to £168m
(2002 £168m), which, together with the
interim dividend, amounts to a total annual
dividend of 9.2p per ordinary share (2002
9.2p), at a total cost of £281m (2002
£281m). After deducting £21m (2002 £21m),
which represents the total for the preference
share dividend, the total retained loss for the
year is £296m (2002 loss £988m).
Charitable donations
During 2003, the amount donated for
charitable purposes in the UK was
£1,327,232 (2002 £1,134,476). Further
details of the company’s charitable activities
are set out on page 26.
Political donations
It is the company’s policy not to make
contributions to political parties.  
The Political Parties, Elections and
Referendums Act 2000 (the Act) amongst
other things, prohibits the company and its
subsidiaries from making donations to EU
Political Organisations (as defined in the Act)
of more than £5,000 in any 12 month period
unless they are authorised to do so by the
company’s shareholders. The Act defines EU
Political Organisations widely as a result of
which the definition could include bodies,
such as those concerned with policy review
and law reform or with the representation of
the business community or sections of it,
which the company may see benefit in
supporting. In recognition of this fact the
shareholders, at the 2002 AGM, authorised
the company and certain of its subsidiaries to
make donations or incur expenditure as
defined in the Act up to an aggregate
maximum of £250,000 in a 12 month period.
The company made a donation of £50,000 in
2003 to Britain in Europe which may be
deemed to fall within the ambit of the Act.
Directors
The names of the current directors are listed
on pages 28 and 29. The full remuneration
report is set out on pages 36 to 45.
Sir Peter Mason and Michael Hartnall were
appointed as directors of the company on
22 January 2003 and 10 June 2003
respectively.
Sir Charles Masefield retired from the Board
on 28 February 2003. Sir Robin Biggam and
Keith Brown retired from the Board on
29 April 2003.
Paolo Scaroni will be retiring from the Board
at the conclusion of this year’s AGM.
Beneficial and non-beneficial interests,
including family interests, in the share capital
of the company, for those persons who were
directors at the end of the financial year are
detailed on page 41. There have been no
changes in the beneficial or non-beneficial
interests of the share capital of the company
in the period from the year end to 25 February
2004. The Board is not aware of any contract
of significance (other than service contracts
or as disclosed in the remuneration report) in
relation to the company or its subsidiaries in
which any director has, or has had, any
material interest.  
Annual General Meeting
The Annual General Meeting of the company
will be held on 5 May 2004. The Notice of
Annual General Meeting is enclosed with this
annual report and details of the resolutions
to be proposed at the meeting. These include
special resolutions amending the company’s
Articles of Association so as to allow the
company to hold shares in the form of
treasury shares and for the disapplication of
pre-emption rights pursuant to section 89 of
the Companies Act 1985. 
Auditors
KPMG Audit Plc, the auditors for the company,
have indicated their willingness to continue in
office and a resolution proposing their 
re-appointment will be put to the Annual
General Meeting.

active concern for the environment. Further
details of the company’s activities in these
areas are set out on pages 25 to 27.
Share capital
As at 25 February 2004, the company had
been advised of the following significant
interests in the issued ordinary share capital
of the company:
Barclays PLC: 3.96%
Brandes Investment Partners, LLC: 12.1%
Franklin Resources, Inc. and its 
affiliates: 8.1%
Legal and General Investment 
Management Limited: 3.0%
The company’s Articles of Association contain
provisions to the effect that no foreign
person, or foreign persons acting in concert,
can have an interest in more than 15% of the
company’s issued ordinary share capital.
At the Annual General Meeting (AGM) held on
29 April 2003 the company was given
authority to purchase up to 306,006,415 of
its ordinary shares. The authority will expire
at the AGM held in 2004. Although no
ordinary shares have been purchased by the
company during the period from 29 April
2003 to the date of this report, a resolution
will be put to shareholders at this year's AGM
to renew the authority to make market
purchases of the company's shares up to a
maximum of 10% of the share capital of the
company. to the profitability forecast for these contracts.
The Board reviews annually the company’s
business plan, its strategy and management
resources.  
The attendance by individual director at
meetings of the Board and its Committees in
2003 is shown in the table opposite.
The terms of reference of the Board’s
Nominations, Audit and Remuneration
Committees state that only members of those
particular committees have a right to be
present at their meetings. The membership of
these committees is reviewed periodically to
ensure that undue reliance is not placed on
any one director. The last such review was
undertaken in April 2003. 
Whilst the Board has delegated the normal
operational management of the company to
the executive directors and other senior
managers it has agreed a schedule of matters
that are reserved for its decision. This
schedule includes:
• approving the group strategy and business
plan;
• ensuring that the company has proper
reporting and internal control systems and
that appropriate polices are in place to
cover matters such as political and
charitable donations, health, safety and the
environment, employment and the export of
defence equipment;
• approving changes to the company’s capital
structure;
• approving major changes to risk
management policies, treasury policies and
the group pension schemes; and 
• approving the acquisition and disposal of
assets above certain limits set by the
Board.
The Operational Framework sets out the
group’s organisation structure together with the
attendant delegated authorities. Within these,
the Board has recognised that the terms on
which the company accepts complex long-term
contracts is critical to the performance of the
company. Therefore, the Board has determined
that all contract bids and tenders above a
certain limit must be approved by it and, given
the different risk profiles of the various stages
of a long-term design and build contract, has
set guidelines on the nature of the contracting
arrangements that it is willing to approve. 
Chairman and chief executive
The chairman and chief executive have been
appointed separately and there is a clear
division of responsibilities between these two
positions. The chairman is responsible for the
effective working of the Board and setting the
Statement of
directors’
responsibilities
Company law requires the directors to
prepare financial statements for each
financial year that give a true and fair view of
the state of affairs of the company and the
group and of the profit or loss for that period.
In preparing those financial statements, the
directors are required to:
•select suitable accounting policies and then
apply them consistently;
•make judgements and estimates that are
reasonable and prudent;
•state whether applicable accounting
standards have been followed, subject to
any material departures disclosed and
explained in the financial statements; and
• prepare the financial statements on the
going concern basis unless it is    
inappropriate to presume that the company 
will continue in business.
The directors are responsible for keeping
proper accounting records which disclose with
reasonable accuracy at any time the financial
position of the company and to enable them
to ensure that the financial statements
comply with the Companies Act 1985. They
have general responsibility for taking such
steps as are reasonably open to them to
safeguard the assets of the group and to
prevent and detect fraud and other
irregularities.
Corporate governance is the process by which
companies are controlled and directed. The UK
Listing Authority has issued the Combined
Code (the Code) that provides UK listed
companies with principles and detailed
provisions on what constitutes best practice in
corporate governance. BAE Systems is
required to report to shareholders on how it
applies the principles in the Code and either to
confirm that it complies with the Code’s
provisions or to explain why it has not.
In July 2003, a revised Code was published
and the UK Listing Authority stated that its
provisions would be annexed to the Listing
Rules with the intention that this would apply
in place of the existing Code in due course. We
are obliged to report to shareholders under the
existing Code for 2003 but will report under
the revised Code next year. However, the Board
recognises that the revised Code is seen by
many as the current best practice for UK
companies. Therefore, the Board has
considered the revised Code and in this report
it provides details of how the principles in the
existing Code and the revised Code have been
applied within BAE Systems.
BAE Systems was compliant with the
provisions of section 1 of the existing Code
throughout 2003. 
Directors
The Board of BAE Systems recognises that it
is responsible for the leadership of the
company and that in discharging this
responsibility it is required to take decisions
objectively and in the best interests of the
company. The Board has set a vision, values
and standards for BAE Systems. Our vision
and values are communicated across the
company and guide the work undertaken by
everyone in BAE Systems. The Board through a
single document, the Operational Framework,
has provided all employees with details of the
standards of behaviour and key policies that
are mandatory across the company. The areas
covered by it include:
• business ethics
• business planning 
• risk management
• internal control 
• personal behaviour.
Further details of the key business processes
described in the Operational Framework appear
below (see business management).
Six regular board meetings are scheduled
during the year and usually a number of
additional meetings are called as required. In
2003, the Board met on nine occasions. At
each regular meeting the Board reviews the
company’s performance against the agreed
business plan, major contracts and variances

Corporate governance
  agenda for its meetings. The chief executive is
responsible for all operational matters. To
ensure that the non-executive directors are
properly informed of matters affecting the
company the chairman and chief executive
meet with them as a group on a regular basis.
Appointments to the Board – the Nominations
Committee
The Board has formed a Nominations
Committee (the Committee) that has been
charged with nominating suitable candidates
for the Board to consider appointing as
directors of the company. The terms of
reference of the Committee were agreed during
2003 and conform with best practice for such
committees as recommended by Derek Higgs
in his report on corporate governance
published in 2003.
The Committee considers the mix of skills and
experiences that the Board requires and seeks
the appointment of directors to meet its
assessment of what is required to ensure that
the Board is effective in discharging its
responsibilities. The Committee appoints
external consultants to assist it in identifying
candidates for nomination to the Board.
Spencer Stuart was appointed to provide such
services during 2003.
During the year the Committee considered the
time that it believed a non-executive director
would normally be required to commit to his or
her duties including serving on the Board’s
committees. Details of these time
commitments have been included in individual
non-executive directors’ letters of appointment.

* including attending meetings of the Nominations and Compensation Committee that was replaced by separate Remuneration and
Nominations committees on 29 April 2003
The attendance by individual directors at meetings of the Board and its Committees
in 2003 was as follows:
During 2003, the Nominations Committee
initiated the search for a successor to the
present chairman, Sir Richard Evans. This has
involved a detailed process of identifying the
skills and experience that the ideal candidate
for this position requires as well as the
amount of time that the individual will need to
devote to the role. The company’s major
shareholders have been consulted as part of
this. It is anticipated that the search for Sir
Richard’s successor will be concluded shortly.
Board balance and independence
At present the Board comprises 14 directors,
half of whom are non-executive. During 2003,
the Board considered that all of the 
non-executive directors were independent
under the provisions of the existing Code.
The Nominations Committee and the Board
have reviewed the provisions in the revised
Code and have concluded that since the
beginning of 2004, under the definitions used,
six of the current non-executive directors are
independent and one, Lord Hesketh, is not.
This is because he and Mr Turner are both
directors of Babcock International Group and
he has been on the Board for more than ten
years with effect from the beginning of 2004.
As a result, at least half of the Board does not
comprise independent non-executive directors
as proposed in the revised Code. The
Nominations Committee and the Board are
aware of this and will be taking it into
consideration in their plans for the future
composition of the Board. 
The Board has appointed Sir Peter Mason as
its senior independent director.
Professional development
The chairman has asked the chief executive to
ensure that the training and development
needs of the executive directors are
understood and addressed. Also, he has asked
the company secretary to work with the 
non-executive directors to provide the
resources and assistance required to keep
their skills and knowledge current. In addition,
the non-executive directors are regularly
provided with opportunities to develop their
understanding of the company by visiting its
facilities and meeting employees.
When a director first joins the Board, the
company secretary is responsible for ensuring
that an induction programme is provided to
meet the needs of the new director. Typically,
this process will cover the duties of a director,
familiarisation with the company’s core
processes and system of internal control as
well as gaining an understanding of the various
businesses by meeting senior managers
throughout the company. New directors also
meet major shareholders if this is requested. 
The company secretary, through the chairman,
is responsible for advising the Board on
governance matters.
Performance evaluation 
The Board has considered the requirement in
the revised Code to evaluate its own
performance and that of its committees and
individual directors. The best means of
effectively undertaking this are being evaluated
with a view to this process being completed
during 2004. The performance of the chairman
has been evaluated by the non-executive
directors led by the senior independent
director, Sir Peter Mason.
Re-election
The company’s Articles of Association require
that all new directors seek re-election to the
Board at the next Annual General Meeting
(AGM) after appointment. In addition, all
directors are required to stand down and seek
re-election to the Board at least once every
three years.
Remuneration
The remuneration of executive directors is
determined by the Remuneration Committee
(the Committee) which comprises solely 
non-executive directors. In determining
remuneration policy the Committee seeks to
provide appropriate levels of remuneration for
senior executives and balance the interests of
shareholders by:
• positioning basic salaries at median
competitive levels whilst seeking to reward
potential upper quartile performance with
upper quartile remuneration;
  34 BAE SYSTEMS Annual report 2003
• aligning corporate and individual
performance criteria for incentive-based
remuneration with the interests of
shareholders; and
• maintaining a personal shareholding policy
of up to 200% of base salary.
No director is involved in deciding his own
remuneration. The chairman of the Committee
consults the chairman of the Board and/or the
chief executive, as appropriate, about
proposals relating to the remuneration of other
executive directors. The fees of the 
non-executive directors are determined by the
Board but the non-executive directors
themselves do not participate in board
discussions or vote on matters concerning
their fees. The company maintains contact with
its principal shareholders in respect of
changes to remuneration policy.
The Committee appoints remuneration
consultants when reviewing remuneration
policy or, where appropriate, requests the
company to appoint them on its behalf. The
group human resources director (who is not a
Board member), as primary internal adviser to
the Committee, takes care to recognise and
avoid any potential conflict of interests when
advising the Committee; the same applies
when the chairman and chief executive are
consulted by the Committee on matters
concerning the other executive directors.
Recognising this potential conflict of interest,
the Committee requires that proposals for
changes to remuneration policy are
underpinned by the provision of externally
validated data.
A more detailed statement of remuneration
policy and audited information relating to the
remuneration of each director is incorporated
into the remuneration report on pages 36 to
45.
Relations with shareholders
The company has a comprehensive investor
relations programme aimed at providing
existing and potential investors with a means
of developing their understanding of the
company and raising any concerns and issues
they may have. The Board as a whole receives
regular reports on investor relations matters.
In addition, it has been agreed that each year
it should formally review investor relations
issues with a view to ensuring that all
members of the Board are acquainted with any
issues or concerns that major shareholders
may have. This review will be facilitated by a
survey of shareholder opinion undertaken
beforehand and the results presented to the
Board.
The AGM provides shareholders with the
opportunity to develop their understanding of
the company and ask questions on the
matters put to the meeting, including the
report and accounts. All shareholders are
entitled to vote on the resolutions put to the
AGM and, to ensure that all votes are counted,
the company’s Articles of Association require
that a poll is taken on all the resolutions in the
Notice of Meeting. The results of the votes on
the resolutions will be published on the
company’s website.
Business management
The Operational Framework sets out
management’s responsibility for identifying,
evaluating and managing risk and performance
throughout the year. Reporting within the
company is structured so that key issues are
escalated through the management team
ultimately to the Board if appropriate. The
Operational Framework provides a common
framework across the company for operational
and financial controls. The business processes
detailed within the Operational Framework draw
on global best practice and their application is
mandated across the organisation. Lifecycle
Management (LCM) is such a process. LCM is
applicable to all projects and, properly applied,
is key to assisting effective project
management from inception (including the bid
process) through to product delivery and,
ultimately, customer support.
Further key processes are Integrated Business
Planning (IBP), monthly Contract Status
Reviews, Quarterly Business Reviews (QBR)
and Monthly Finance Reviews. The IBP
approved annually by the Board, results in an
agreed long-term strategy for each business
group, together with detailed near-term
budgets. The QBRs evaluate progress against
the IBP and are chaired by the chief operating
officers and the group managing director of the
CS&S business.
The company is committed to the protection of
its assets, which include human, property and
financial resources, through an effective risk
management process, underpinned where
appropriate by insurance. 
The internal audit team independently reviews
the risk identification procedures and control
processes implemented by management. It
provides objective assurance as to the
operation and validity of the systems of
internal control through a programme of
cyclical reviews making recommendations for
business and control improvements. 
Internal control
The overall responsibility for the system of
internal control within BAE Systems rests with
the directors of the company. Responsibility for
establishing and operating detailed control
procedures lies with the managing director of
each operating business.  
The directors have completed a formal review
of the effectiveness of the company’s internal
controls. In order to assist the Board in this
review, an Operational Assurance Statement
(OAS) is produced by each part of the
business. It is signed off by the relevant
managing director to confirm compliance with
the Operational Framework, including
operational and financial controls and risk
management processes. The OAS is
completed every half year and includes a
formal assessment of business risk.
As with any system of internal control, the
policies and procedures that are mandated in
the Operational Framework are designed to
manage rather than eliminate the risk of failure
to achieve business objectives, and can only
provide reasonable and not absolute
assurance against material misstatement or
loss.
The responsibility for internal control
procedures within joint ventures and other
collaborations rests, on the whole, with the
senior management of those operations. The
company monitors its investments and exerts
influence through Board representation.
Going concern
After making due enquiries, the directors have
a reasonable expectation that the group has
adequate resources to continue in operational
existence for the foreseeable future. For this

Audit Committee report
The Board’s Audit Committee (the Committee)
is chaired by Michael Hartnall who until
recently was the finance director of a major 
UK-listed company. In addition to Mr Hartnall
there are a further three members of the
Committee. The Committee normally asks the
company’s chief executive, finance director and
internal audit director to attend its meetings
together with the external auditors. During the
year the Committee has met on occasions with
no executive directors present and has also
met with only the internal audit director or the
external auditors present.
Prior to 2003, the Committee was scheduled
to meet three times each year. Following a
review of the work that the Committee wished
to undertake during the year it was decided
that four meetings should be scheduled for
2003 and subsequent years. The Committee
has agreed an annual programme of matters
to be covered by the Committee at these
scheduled meetings.
In 2003, the Committee considered the report
produced by Sir Robert Smith on audit
committees and, whilst the Committee was
largely compliant, a number of actions were
  BAE SYSTEMS Annual report 2003 35
taken to ensure that the Committee was fully
compliant with this most recent statement on
best practice. The recommendations in the
Smith Report have been adopted by the
Financial Reporting Council and are now
included as part of the revised Code.  
The Committee’s terms of reference were
revised during 2003 and now incorporate fully
the provisions contained in the revised Code.  
Since the beginning of 2003 the Committee
has, amongst other things, undertaken the
following in order to discharge its
responsibilities:
• reviewed the financial statements in the
2002 and 2003 annual reports and the
interim report issued in September 2003. As
part of this review the Committee received
reports from the external auditors on their
audits of the annual reports and review of
the interim report;
• reviewed the effectiveness of the company’s
internal controls and disclosures made in
the annual reports on this matter;
• reviewed and agreed the scope of the audit
work to be undertaken by the external
auditors; 
• agreed guidelines for employment of former
employees of the company’s external
auditors;
• considered a report from the external
auditors on their review of financial controls
across the group and received a report on
management action taken in response to the
management letter issued by the external
auditors following the 2002 audit;
• agreed the fees paid to the external auditors
for their audit of the 2003 accounts;
• evaluated the performance of the external
auditors;
• evaluated the performance of the internal
audit function;
• agreed a programme of work for the
company’s internal audit function;
• received a report from the internal audit
director on the work undertaken by internal
audit and management responses to
recommendations made in the audit reports
issued by the function during the year;
• reviewed its own effectiveness; and
• monitored the work being undertaken by the
group in preparation for the introduction of
International Accounting Standards.
The company has established an employee
hotline to provide a means by which employees
can raise any concerns they may have about
unethical business conduct. To help ensure
that employees have confidence in this
arrangement the hotline is provided by a third
party who passes details of calls or e-mails
received to the internal audit director.  
The Committee receives a report on individual
contacts made to the hotline which includes a
summary of the nature of the issue raised and
details of any action taken.
The Committee has formally reviewed whether
there are any factors that may prejudice the
independence of the external auditors (the
auditors). As part of this review the Committee
recognised that, in addition to the statutory
work undertaken by the company’s auditors,
there will be certain work of a non-audit nature
that is best undertaken by the auditors. It
believes that, provided suitable controls are in
place, undertaking this work does not
compromise the auditors. The following
specific actions have been taken by the
Committee to safeguard the auditors’
independence:
• rules have been issued controlling the nature
and quantity of non-audit work that may be
undertaken by the auditors;
• guidelines have been adopted restricting the
employment within the group of individuals
formerly employed by the auditors;
• the auditors are required to confirm in writing
to the Committee each year that they believe
that they remain independent within the
meaning of the regulations on this matter
and their professional standards; and
• the independence of the auditors is
considered each year by the Committee as
part of its formal review of their
appointment.
As reported to shareholders last year, the
Committee has adopted a programme of
undertaking a major review of the company’s
auditors every three years and in the years in
between undertaking a review to monitor their
performance. The next major review will be in
respect of the appointment of auditors for the
year ending 31 December 2006. A review of
the performance of the company’s auditors
was undertaken recently by the Committee. On
the basis of this review the Committee
recommended to the Board that they support
the re-appointment of KPMG Audit Plc as the
company’s auditors. The Board has agreed
with this recommendation and consequently a
resolution to this effect will be put to
shareholders at the company’s AGM.

Remuneration policy
The Committee’s executive remuneration
policy continues to be to set basic salaries at
median competitive levels whilst seeking to
reward upper quartile performance with
potential upper quartile remuneration. The
Committee intends to continue with the
executive remuneration policy as detailed in
this report in 2004 and subsequent years,
subject to ongoing review as appropriate, and
to make amendments to remuneration, as
appropriate, to maintain this position. 
The long-standing policy of allowing executive
directors to hold external non-BAE Systems
related non-executive directorships with the
prior approval of the Committee will continue.
The Committee considers that external
directorships provide the company’s senior
executives with valuable experience. The
director may retain any fees received from
such appointments. Such fees retained by
the full-time executive directors in 2003 were
as follows: Michael Lester £32,845; George
Rose £53,750; and Mike Turner £27,000.
Review of long-term incentive arrangements
As part of its formulation of future policy, in
2003 the Committee undertook a detailed
review of the competitiveness of the existing
long-term incentive arrangements and recent
developments in remuneration practice. To
assist in the review the Committee appointed
New Bridge Street Consultants.
In line with company policy, extensive
consultation took place with the company’s
principal shareholders (based both in the UK
and overseas) as well as institutional investor
bodies. Taking on board views expressed
during the consultation process, a number of
modifications were made to the application of
the Executive Share Option Plan and the
Performance Share Plan. 
The review concluded that the company
should operate both plans for executive
directors within the following framework,
ensuring that the level of awards are in line
with similar plans operated by other 
FTSE 100 companies:
•options granted under the Executive Share
Option Plan to be set at a maximum of
1.5 x salary (under the existing scheme
rules the maximum grant is 3 x salary); 
•awards under the Performance Share Plan
to be set at 1 x salary. Having taken market
data into account, the Committee decided
to set the median level of vesting for the
2003 and 2004 awards at 25%. Thus, one
quarter of the shares under award will be
released if the company’s total shareholder
return (TSR) performance (share price
growth plus dividends) over a three-year
performance period is in the top 50% of the
TSR comparator group, with 100% of the
shares under award being released if the
TSR is in the top 20%. Intermediate
positions will be calculated on a straight
line pro-rata basis;
•recognising the specific and international
nature of the company’s business activities,
the TSR comparator group for the
Performance Share Plan has been changed
from the FTSE 100 Index constituents to a
list of 18 other major defence and
aerospace companies operating in the
international arena as a more appropriate
measure of TSR performance. The
comparator group is as follows:
Boeing Cobham
Dassault Aviation EADS
Embraer PN Finmeccanica
General Dynamics GKN
Goodrich Honeywell International
Lockheed Martin Northrop Grumman
Raytheon Rockwell Automation
Rolls-Royce Smiths Group

The Remuneration Committee
The Board has delegated to the
Remuneration Committee responsibility for
remuneration policy and specific packages for
the executive directors. Until 29 April 2003
remuneration matters were dealt with by the
Nominations and Compensation Committee
which also had responsibility for nominating
suitable candidates to the Board. Its
composition comprised Sir Robin Biggam
(chairman), Professor Sue Birley, Keith Brown,
Lord Hesketh and, when it acted in the
capacity of nominating individuals to the
Board, Sir Richard Evans. On 29 April 2003
the Nominations and Compensation
Committee was split into separate
Remuneration and Nominations Committees.
The Remuneration Committee is chaired by
Professor Sue Birley and its other members
are Lord Hesketh
1
, Sir Peter Mason and
Dr Ulrich Cartellieri, all of whom are 
non-executive directors and were considered
to be independent throughout 2003. The
company’s chairman and chief executive
attend committee meetings by invitation only.
They do not attend where their individual
remuneration is discussed and no director is
involved in deciding his own remuneration.
In 2003 the Nominations and Compensation
Committee met twice up to 28 April 2003 to
consider remuneration issues and, from
29 April 2003 until the end of the year, the
Remuneration Committee met four times.
Details of attendance at these meetings are
provided in the corporate governance report
on page 33. Within this remuneration report
references to ‘the Committee’ relate to both
the Remuneration Committee as well as the
Nominations and Compensation Committee
where it dealt with remuneration-related
matters. During the year the Committee
reviewed its terms of reference to align them
with best practice under the revised
Combined Code.
During 2003, Sir Richard Evans and Mike
Turner, in their respective capacities as
chairman and chief executive, provided advice
that was of material assistance to the
Committee. The Committee also received
material assistance and advice on
remuneration policy and recruitment from the
company’s group human resources director,
Alastair Imrie. In addition, the Committee
received advice and/or services that were of
material assistance from the following:

  The Committee will continue with the use of
this industry comparator group for 2004
and beyond, although the specific
composition of the industry comparator
group will be reviewed on an annual basis;
and
•in addition to the TSR test outlined above,
shares in the Performance Share Plan will
only be released after three years if the
Committee is satisfied that there has been
a sustained improvement in underlying
financial performance.
Shareholders’ views of the appropriateness of
the re-testing of performance under the
Executive Share Option Plan, where the
performance conditions have not been met
over the original three-year period, have
evolved since the plan was approved by
shareholders in 2001. The Committee is
aware of these views and has considered
whether the policy of allowing two re-testing
opportunities for future grants of options
should continue to be provided (there are no
re-tests within the Performance Share Plan).
The conclusion of the review was that for
grants made in 2004, one re-test only will be
allowed at the end of year five against the full
period since grant. A further review of the
policy relating to re-tests will take place prior
to any grant of options in 2005. 
The above represents ongoing policy and the
Committee will continue to consult on
changes with principal shareholders.
Elements of remuneration
Remuneration of executive directors consists
typically of basic salary, a bonus based on
annual performance, participation in
employee share schemes and retirement
benefits. The following provides more details
of these benefits. 
Basic salary and benefits
Executive directors’ salaries are reviewed
each year by the Committee and adjusted to
reflect performance and the competitiveness
of salaries relative to the market. Information
on the market for comparable management
positions is obtained from independent
sources and is provided to the Committee so
that it can form a view as to where to
position basic salaries and benefits relative
to comparable companies. All reviews of
salaries and benefits for executive directors
are made having taken full account of the
performance of the group as a whole and the
pay and conditions of group employees in
particular. It continues to be the company’s
aim to create an environment with policies
which fairly reward individual performance
against business objectives; this applies
equally to all employees.
The Committee has reviewed regularly the
split between basic salary and the
performance related elements of
remuneration in order to incentivise properly
executive directors, and believes that a
significant proportion of remuneration should
be based on schemes that encourage them
to perform at the highest level. Through the
use of share-based incentive schemes, the
Committee seeks to align the interests of
executive directors with those of other
shareholders. It is the company’s policy to set
basic salaries at median levels of a
comparable group of companies and to
incentivise and reward exceptional executive
performance through the bonus schemes and
share-based incentives. Through this
arrangement, it is possible for those
individuals who contribute to sustained high
levels of company performance to receive at
least a similar level of reward from variable
compensation to that received from fixed
compensation. At median performance,
variable remuneration represents
approximately 50% of the remuneration
package; at upper quartile performance
variable remuneration represents significantly
more than this. 
Annual bonus scheme
The executive directors (with the exception of
Sir Richard Evans) and other senior
executives participate in a bonus scheme
that rewards those individuals if targets
agreed by the Committee for earnings per
share (EPS), profit before interest and tax
(PBIT), cash performance and certain 
non-financial targets are met. The EPS figure
used for the bonus scheme (and for the
Executive Share Option Plan) is based on
basic EPS excluding goodwill amortisation
and impairment and exceptional items and
may be adjusted if necessary to ensure that
the figures for individual years are broadly
comparable. In determining the performance
measures for the annual bonus scheme, the
Committee took the view that our major
investors believed EPS and cash targets (and,
where appropriate, PBIT) to be key indicators
of long-term financial performance and value
creation. These measures will be reviewed
each year to determine whether they are still
appropriate.
As a result of its annual review of the
performance related aspects of remuneration,
which included consideration of market
comparator information, for 2004 the
Committee determined that the policy for
maximum bonus entitlement will be 100% of
basic salary. It was considered appropriate to
take account of different US remuneration
practices in determining the maximum bonus
entitlement for Mark Ronald which in 2004
will be 150% of his basic salary. For 2004,
the bonus performance metrics for the chief
executive, group finance director and group
legal director are based on a mix of 
group-related EPS and cash targets, and 
non-financial targets. The bonus performance
metrics for the three chief operating officers
are based on a mix of group-related EPS and
cash targets, PBIT and cash targets relating
to their discrete areas of operational
responsibility, and non-financial targets. For
each element of the bonus there is a base
target and a stretch target; intermediate
payments are payable for performance
between these two targets. 
Share option schemes and long-term
incentive schemes
As stated above, during 2003 a detailed
review and consultation process with principal
shareholders and institutional investor bodies
was undertaken in respect of long-term
incentive arrangements and appropriate
modifications made to their operation.
Performance conditions for grants of options
or awards in 2004, under the Executive Share
Option Plan and the Performance Share Plan,
are detailed below. Performance conditions
for earlier option grants and awards are
shown as notes to table C.
Executive Share Option Plan
Options granted under the BAE Systems
Executive Share Option Plan are normally
exercisable between the third and tenth
anniversary of their grant. Options may only
be exercised during this period as follows:
•33.33% of each option grant is exercisable
if the company achieves on average real
EPS growth per annum of 3% but less than
4% over the three-year performance period;
•66.67% of each option grant is exercisable
if the company achieves on average real
EPS growth per annum of 4% but less than
5% over the three-year performance period;
•100% of each option grant is exercisable if
the company achieves on average real EPS
growth per annum of 5% or more over the
three-year performance period.
BAE SYSTEMS Annual report 2003 37 company shares the cash bonuses that they
have earned under the bonus scheme, which
was itself based on performance criteria. Our
personal shareholding policy (see below)
reinforces this philosophy.
There were no awards made under the
Restricted Share Plan in 2003, however, the
Committee intends to operate this plan in
2004 and future years.
SAYE Share Option Scheme
The executive directors (with the exception of
Mark Ronald) are entitled to participate in the
company’s Save-As-You-Earn Share Option
Scheme. Statutory provisions do not allow
options granted under these schemes to be
subject to any performance conditions.
Dilution of share capital
The Committee has agreed that the maximum
number of options that shall be granted in
any one year, which are to be satisfied by new
issue shares, will not exceed 1% of the
company’s issued share capital.
Personal shareholding policy
The Committee has agreed a policy whereby
all executive directors are required to
establish and maintain a minimum personal
shareholding equal to 200% of salary. As a
minimum a holding equal to 100% of salary
must be achieved as quickly as possible
using shares vesting or options exercised
through the executive share option schemes
or long-term incentive schemes, by using 50%
of the shares that vest or 50% of the options
which are exercised on each occasion.
Thereafter executive directors are required to
increase their personal shareholding
gradually, on each occasion using 25% of the
shares that vest or 25% of the options
exercised each year, until a personal
shareholding equal to 200% of annual salary
is achieved and maintained. These limits are
reviewed periodically. Details of the directors’
personal shareholdings are shown in table A.
Post retirement benefits
The executive directors of the company are
members of group pension schemes and have
a normal retirement age of 60, except Michael
Lester and Mark Ronald who have a normal
retirement age of 62. The pension schemes
for the UK-based directors are designed to
produce a target pension of two-thirds of final
pensionable earnings if potential service is 20
or more years. Final pensionable earnings is
38 BAE SYSTEMS Annual report 2003
For options granted from 2004 onwards,
performance will be retested once only at the
end of year five. Satisfaction of the re-testing
provision requires on average real EPS
growth of 3%, 4% or 5% (in line with the
percentage of options exercisable as set out
above) over the full five-year period. Thus,
where the re-testing provision is applied, total
real EPS growth of 25% over the five-year
period would be required to enable option
grants to be exercised at 100%. Policy on
re-testing provisions will be reviewed annually
by the Committee.
In determining the performance measure for
the Executive Share Option Plan, the
Committee took the view that our major
investors believe EPS to be a key indicator of
long-term financial performance and value
creation.
Performance Share Plan
From 1996 to 2000 conditional awards of
shares were made to executive directors
under the Performance Share Plan which was
approved by shareholders in 1996. All such
awards have vested or lapsed in accordance
with the relevant performance measures as
set out in the note to table C. 
Following consultation with principal
shareholders and institutional investor bodies
in 2003, conditional awards were granted to
executive directors under the Performance
Share Plan for which the eventual quantum
capable of exercise will be determined by a
TSR ranking relative to a comparator group of
18 other defence and aerospace companies
operating in the international arena. TSR will
continue to be used in 2004 as the principal
measure due to its importance to our
shareholders as an indication of both
earnings and capital growth relative to major
global defence and aerospace companies. A
relative measure is considered important as
it rewards management if they outperform
against major companies in the same sector
rather than success possibly being
determined solely by growth in stock markets.
The Committee formed the view that use of a
sectoral comparator group was considered by
our principal shareholders and institutional
investor bodies to be more appropriate than
using the FTSE 100 as had been the case
historically with awards under this plan. In
recognition of our principal shareholders’ and
institutional investor bodies’ requirement to
retain a secondary financial measure (which
was previously EPS), release of the awards
will also be conditional on the Committee
being satisfied that there is a sustained
improvement in the company’s underlying
financial performance. 
Performance for the 2004 award will therefore
be measured as follows: 
(i) total shareholder return (TSR)
100% of the conditional shares are 
awarded to directors if the company’s TSR 
over a three-year period is in the top 20% 
of TSRs achieved by a comparator group of 
18 other major global defence and 
aerospace companies, with 25% vesting if 
the TSR is in the top 50%. Intermediate 
positions will be calculated on a 
straight-line pro-rata basis. No awards will 
be made if the company’s performance is 
outside the top 50%. Awards will be made 
in three equal instalments at the end of 
years three, four and five; 
(ii) underlying financial performance
as a secondary measure the Committee 
will consider whether there has been a 
sustained improvement in the company’s 
underlying financial performance and 
whether it is appropriate to release some 
or all of the awards. In taking a view of a 
sustained improvement in underlying 
financial performance, the Committee may 
consider (but not exclusively) the following 
financial metrics: net debt/cash; PBIT; 
order book; turnover; risk; and underlying 
project performance.
Awards in 2004 will continue to be granted at
a value equal to the individual director’s
base salary.
Restricted Share Plan
Executive directors who participate in the
annual bonus scheme may be given the
option of taking any net cash bonus paid
partly or wholly in shares through the
Restricted Share Plan. If an election is made
to take shares through the plan, they are held
in trust for a period of three years after which
the company awards the individual an equal
number of shares provided the individual
remained in the company’s employment at
the vesting date. Where executive directors
have previously elected to apply such bonus
through the Restricted Share Plan, details of
the shares held and vested in 2003 are set
out in table B. The matching award of shares
is not subject to any performance criteria as
the scheme is designed to retain key staff
and to encourage executives to re-invest in
  basic salary averaged over the last 12 months
prior to leaving service. Pensions can be paid
before normal retirement age, subject to the
consent of the company and pension scheme
trustees. These schemes also provide a lump
sum death-in-service benefit equal to four
times basic salary at date of death, and a
spouse’s pension equal to two-thirds of the
prospective pension at normal retirement age
or, once retired, of the actual pension in
payment (before any lump sum commutation).
Children’s allowances are also payable, usually
up to the age of 18, upon death in service or
death in retirement. If the directors leave with
a deferred pension and die after age 50 but
before the pension has commenced, a lump
sum benefit is paid equal to five times the
annual rate of pension that would have been
paid had the deferred pension commenced
immediately before date of death. If a director
dies with a deferred pension before age 50, a
refund of his contributions will be paid and a
pension will be paid to his legal spouse in line
with the rules of the scheme for all group
employees. Pensions are increased annually
by the rise in the Retail Prices Index subject to
a maximum increase of 5% per year. Directors
pay contributions at the same rate as all other
employees participating in the schemes.
Of the executive directors, George Rose is
affected by the Inland Revenue earnings cap
on approved pensions and has an
unapproved (i.e. non-tax qualified) pension
arrangement to top up his benefits from the
approved schemes. This is designed so that
the total pension from all sources will be
broadly in line with the pension he would
have received from the group pension
schemes, had he not been subject to the
pensions cap. Further information on the
amounts paid by the company in respect of
these arrangements is included in the notes
to table F.
Mark Ronald is covered by the company’s US
pension arrangements and the non-qualified
supplemental arrangements in place under
his contract. Mark Ronald’s aggregate
retirement benefit is determined based upon
his average salary and service in accordance
with individual plan documents and
contractual agreements and is broadly 
one-thirtieth of average annual pay (including
bonus) for each year of service. In addition
he receives benefits from predecessor
schemes. Having passed his normal
retirement age of 62, he has been in receipt
of benefits payable under the non-qualified
supplemental arrangements since the
BAE SYSTEMS Annual report 2003 39
beginning of 2004. In line with the rules of
the US arrangements, it is not expected that
the pensions will be increased once in
payment. Death benefits under the plans are
provided by a pension continuation to his
spouse or dependants in accordance with
specific payments from each scheme.
Members of US plans have the right to
change the form of pension payments, on a
cost neutral basis, if they wish to have a
different level of spouse and dependant
pension.
Under the rules of the schemes, Sir Richard
Evans and Michael Lester commenced their
pensions in 2002 having reached normal
retirement age. Neither of these two
executive directors has accrued further
benefits since retiring other than pension
increases awarded to all pensioner members
of their pension schemes. Sir Charles
Masefield, who retired from the Board on
28 February 2003, had a normal retirement
age of 62 and, under the rules of the
scheme, commenced his pension in 2002
having reached normal retirement age. He,
too, did not accrue further benefits once
having retired other than pension increases
awarded to all pensioner members of his
pension scheme.
Details of post retirement benefits are shown
in table F and are calculated in accordance
with the requirements of Schedule 7A to the
Companies Act 1985.
Other benefits
Other benefits provided to the executive
directors include a car allowance, cash
allowance for medical examination and, where
appropriate, second residence support
allowance. Recognising the need for the chief
executive to spend a substantial amount of
time in central London on company business,
the Committee agreed in 2003 to make a
payment of £46,123 to Mike Turner towards
meeting the costs of accommodation required
in London. A further payment of £25,000 will
be made in each of the years 2004 and
2005. These payments are in line with group
policy for second residence support.
The graph above, which has been produced in accordance with the
requirements of Schedule 7A to the Companies Act 1985, shows the
total shareholder return for a holding in the company’s ordinary shares
for the period 1998 – 2003 relative to a holding of shares representing
the FTSE 100. The FTSE 100 is considered to be an appropriate
comparator for this purpose as it is a broad equity market index. As
BAE Systems is a constituent member of the FTSE 100, it was deemed
to be the most appropriate general UK equity index.

Service contracts
It is the Committee’s policy that executive
directors should normally have service
contracts that provide for the company to
give the individual 12 months notice of
termination. This policy has been chosen
because it provides a reasonable balance
between the need to retain the services of key
individuals and the need to limit the liabilities
of the company in the event of the termination
of a contract. The executive directors have
service contracts with group companies;
details of these contracts are shown in the
table above.
Sir Richard Evans has a contract requiring
him to work three days a week in his capacity
as chairman. This was signed on 16 July
2002, amending a contract entered into on
24 September 1998, and was further
amended on 15 January 2004. This contract
can be terminated by either party giving six
months notice. 
Sir Charles Masefield’s contract expired on
28 February 2003 and he retired as a
director on that date. Since then Sir Charles
has continued to be employed by the
company on a part-time basis in an overseas
representational role for which he is being
remunerated as set out in the notes to
table E.
In the event of the termination of an
executive director’s contract it is the
Committee’s policy to seek to limit any
payment made in lieu of notice to a payment
equal to the amount of one year’s basic
salary. The service contracts for all of the
executive directors contain specific provisions
to the effect that the company has the right
to pay a sum equivalent to 12 months salary
in the event of the company terminating their
contracts for reasons other than gross
misconduct. Under the terms of his contract
Mark Ronald is entitled to compensation of a
lump sum equal to 12 months salary, and the
continuance of medical benefits for
18 months, if his contract is terminated by
BAE Systems North America, his directorship

is not renewed at the end of its rolling 
one-year term. He will also be entitled to

applicable performance conditions.
Non-executive directors do not have service
contracts but do have letters of appointment
detailing the basis of their appointment. The
dates of their original appointment (with the
exception of Lord Hesketh) are as follows:
Non-executive Date of Expiry of current

Non-executive directors are normally appointed
for two consecutive three-year terms subject to
review after the end of the first three-year
period. They do not have periods of notice and
the company has no obligation to pay
compensation when their appointment
terminates. They are subject to re-election at
the Annual General Meeting following their
appointment and subsequently at intervals of
no more than three years.
Lord Hesketh was appointed as a 
non-executive director on 1 January 1994 and
has exceptionally served three terms. With
effect from 1 January 2004 he will be subject
to re-election at the AGM on an annual basis
as required by the revised Combined Code.
Paolo Scaroni will be retiring from the Board at
the conclusion of this year’s AGM. Sir Robin
Biggam and Keith Brown retired from the Board
at the 2003 AGM on 29 April 2003; they were
originally appointed to the Board on 1 January
1994 and 16 March 1989 respectively.
The letters of appointment for non-executive
directors detail the amount of time it is
anticipated that the individual will normally
need to devote to his or her duties as a
director. Non-executive directors are proposed
by the Nominations Committee and are
appointed by the Board on the basis of their
experience to provide independent judgement
on issues of strategy, performance, resources
and standards of conduct. The level of their
fees is set after reviewing practice in other
comparable companies. 
Non-executive directors are paid a basic fee
reflecting the time commitment required of
the director. In addition, the chairmen of the
individual committees receive a fee in
recognition of their duties of chairmen of the
respective committees, reflecting their
additional responsibilities and workload. Fees
payable to non-executive directors are agreed
by the Board; the non-executive directors
themselves do not participate in board
discussions or vote on matters concerning
their fees. Details of the non-executives’ fees
are shown in the notes to table E.

Michael Lester holds a non-beneficial interest in 200,000 (2002 200,000) ordinary shares. The 5,190,100 (2002 5,190,100) capital amortising loan stock previously held by Michael Lester on a 
non-beneficial basis was fully redeemed on 28 November 2003.
The executive directors, in common with all employees of the company, have an interest in the unallocated shares held in employee share ownership trusts. As at 
31 December 2003, 2,344,928 such shares were held in the ESOP trust and 331,209 shares in the Profit Sharing Scheme trust.

The Committee is of the opinion that to give a full statement of directors’ share options and long-term incentive scheme interests would result in a statement of excessive
length. Therefore disclosure is in accordance with paragraph 9 of Schedule 7A to the Companies Act 1985. The company's register of directors' interests (which is open to
inspection) contains full details of directors' shares interests. Details of directors’ interests in the share option schemes and long-term incentive plans are shown in
tables B, C and D. The figures in the tables that form part of this report have been calculated by reference to a mid-market price for the company's ordinary shares at
31 December 2003 of 168.25p (2002 124p). The range during 2003 was 196.5p to 101.75p. At the year end none of the unexercised share options granted to the
directors were capable of being exercised at a profit.

At the time of the merger between British Aerospace and the MES business, the Committee agreed that the retention of Mark Ronald as head of the North American
business was key to the success of that business and as a result a one-off award was made to him on 30 April 2000 through the Share Investment Plan. Under the rules
of this plan, if he retained shares for a period of at least three years, the company would award him an equivalent number of shares on the third anniversary of the holding
period. These retained shares are shown under Mark Ronald’s personal shareholding in table A. The award made under the plan was not subject to performance criteria,
other than that the individual remained in the company’s employment, as the prime objective was to retain his services.
The aggregate net value of assets received by directors in 2003 from long-term incentive plans, as calculated at date of release from trust, was £217,745.

The terms and conditions of the options detailed above were not varied during the period 1 January 2003 to 31 December 2003.
The mid-market price for the company’s ordinary shares at 31 December 2003 was 168.25p (2002 124p). The range during 2003 was 196.5p to 101.75p. At the year end none of the unexercised
share options granted to the directors were capable of being exercised at a profit.
Executive Share Option Plan
The BAE Systems Executive Share Option Plan has been used to grant options to the executive directors since 2001. The performance conditions applying to the
grants of options made in 2001, 2002 and 2003 are the same as for grants to be made in 2004, as set out on page 37 of this report with the exception of the
re-testing provision; for grants made between 2001 – 2003, where the original three-year performance target is not met, performance is re-tested at the end of
years four and five against the full period from grant. The options will lapse at the end of year five if the targets have not been achieved.
Before 1996, and also on the completion of the British Aerospace/MES merger in 1999, options were granted to executive directors under the predecessor
Executive Share Option Scheme. Options granted in 1995 can only be exercised if growth in the pre-exceptional EPS for any three-year period exceeds the sum of
inflation for that period and a real growth requirement of 7.5%. Options granted to the former GEC directors in 1999 were made on a similar basis but the real
growth requirement is 9% for any three-year period. Options granted to other executive directors in 1999 were conditional on the satisfaction of a performance
condition based on the achievement of cost savings of the merger integration process over a three-year performance period. Options will become exercisable on a
sliding scale from zero to 100% between achievement of the base synergy cost savings target of £275m and the full stretch target of £400m.
Performance Share Plan
From 1996 to 2000 conditional awards of shares were made to executive directors under the Performance Share Plan which was approved by shareholders in
1996. All such awards have now vested or lapsed in accordance with the relevant performance measure, with those lapsing in 2003 detailed above. Performance
was measured relative to the other constituent members of the FTSE 100 over a three-year period, with 100% of the conditional shares vesting if the company’s
Total Shareholder Return (TSR) was in the top 20% of TSRs achieved by FTSE 100 companies, 10% vesting if the TSR was in the top 50%, and intermediate
positions being calculated on a straight line pro-rata basis. Vesting was also subject to a secondary measure requiring the EPS excluding exceptional items over
the performance period to be no less than the average value for the three years prior to the performance period. Awards were made in three equal instalments at
the end of years three, four and five.
Performance conditions for the 2003 awards are the same as for awards to be made in 2004, as set out on page 38 of this report.

All emoluments and compensation paid to the directors during the year is shown above. Where the individual was appointed during the year the amount shown is
for the period from appointment.
The benefits received by all the executive directors except for Mark Ronald, were cash allowances for a medical examination and for the provision of a car. The
benefits for Mike Turner also included a second residence support allowance of £46,123 for the costs of accommodation required in central London. The benefits
received by Mark Ronald were a cash allowance for a car, fuel and maintenance for the car, annual medical examination and medical insurance related benefits,
and country club membership.
During 2003, non-executive directors were paid a basic fee of £30,000 per annum reflecting the time commitment required as a director and were also paid a fee
of £1,000 for each of the six scheduled Board meetings that they attended. Up to 28 April 2003 the chairman of the Audit Committee and the Nominations and
Compensation Committee each received an additional fee of £6,000 in recognition of their duties as chairman of those committees. Following changes to the
committee structure from 29 April 2003, and to reflect the increasing time commitment required by the committee chairmen to fulfil their duties, the fees of the
committee chairmen were reviewed and amended so that the chairmen of the Audit Committee and the Remuneration Committee received additional annual fees
of £29,000 and £14,000 respectively and the chairman of the Nominations Committee, who is also the senior independent director, received an additional annual
fee of £14,000.
Sir Charles Masefield retired as a director on 28 February 2003 but remains employed by the company on a part-time basis in an overseas representational role.
From 1 March 2003 to 31 December 2003 his remuneration was £235,000 and comprised salary and a cash allowance for a car. There were no other payments
to former directors during the year other than the payment to Richard Lapthorne referred to in the notes to table F.

* Mark Ronald has exercised a right, allowed under the rules of his supplementary arrangements, for part of his overall pension to be paid for a period of 10 years instead of for the 
remainder of his life. This right is granted on a cost neutral basis, and the 10 year pension is calculated by multiplying the whole life pension by an actuarial factor. Of the total accrued 
pension at 31 December 2003, £227,518 will be paid for a period of 10 years only. The corresponding accrued pension at 31 December 2002 allowing for the exercise of this right was
£344,892 (of which £189,674 would have been payable for 10 years) and this pension has, for consistency, been used to calculate the increase in accrued benefits in 2003. The 2002
remuneration report disclosed an accrued pension of £275,578 at 31 December 2002 - this figure assumed the right would not be exercised. Of Mark Ronald’s total accrued pension at 31
December 2003, £141,833 has a contingent 50% spouse’s pension.
** the transfer value at 1 January 2003 is different from the transfer value of £2,338,500 disclosed in the 2002 remuneration report. The transfer value disclosed last year, as calculated
by independent actuaries, assumed that certain benefits would commence at age 65 instead of Mark Ronald’s actual normal retirement age of 62 and, in addition, it did not take full account
of his actual pensionable pay at the end of 2002.
Mark Ronald reached his normal retirement age of 62 in 2003. Mark Ronald ceased to accrue any additional benefits under his non-qualified supplemental pension
arrangements after 31 December 2003, and payments commenced under these arrangements in January 2004. The payments are subject to his right to elect to receive
lump sum payments in lieu of non-qualified supplemental pension payments. Under the rules of the North America Qualified Plan, Mark Ronald will continue to accrue
benefits under the plan until his actual retirement from company service. The accrued pensions and transfer value at 31 December 2003 set out in the table above take
account of the pension benefits already in payment. Mark Ronald participates in the Section 401(k) defined contribution arrangement set up for US employees in which the
company will match employee contributions up to a limit. In 2003, the company paid contributions of $2,200 (2002 $2,000) into Mark Ronald’s 401(k) arrangement. 
George Rose’s unapproved retirement arrangement is partly funded and partly unfunded. The company’s pension contribution to the funded unapproved retirement
arrangement for George Rose in 2003 was £1,237,697 (2002 £320,172). There were two main reasons behind the need to pay a substantially higher contribution in
2003; the need to change the actuarial basis underlying the calculations and investment under-performance. The revised actuarial basis is consistent with the funding
basis used for the approved pension schemes (with adjustments to take account of the different tax treatment). This change accounts for approximately £735,000 of the
contribution in 2003. The company has decided to deal with the under-performance of the underlying investments over a three-year period and, of the amount paid in
2003, £172,000 is accounted for by this item; similar payments are planned for the years 2004 and 2005 (subject to the impact of the UK government’s new pension
taxation proposals). This treatment reflects our policy for other employees in the same position. The balance of £331,000 represents the normal contributions expected in
any one year and this compares directly with the payment in 2002 of £320,172. The accrued benefits shown in table F above include the benefits from the approved and
unapproved arrangements.

Under the rules of the schemes, Sir Richard Evans and Michael Lester commenced their pensions in 2002 having reached normal retirement age. Sir Charles Masefield,
who retired from the Board on 28 February 2003, also commenced his pension in 2002 having reached normal retirement age. None of these three individuals have
accrued further benefits since retiring other than pension increases awarded to all pensioner members of their pension schemes.
Richard Lapthorne, a former director, has an unfunded pension scheme. In 2003 the company paid Richard Lapthorne £82,758 (2002 £81,375) in respect of this
arrangement. 46 BAE SYSTEMS Annual report 2003
Independent auditors’ report to the members of BAE SYSTEMS plc
We have audited the financial statements on pages 48 to 91. We have also audited the information in the directors’ remuneration
report that is described as having been audited.
This report is made solely to the company’s members, as a body, in accordance with Section 235 of the Companies Act 1985. Our
audit work has been undertaken so that we might state to the company’s members those matters we are required to state to them
in an auditor’s report and for no other purpose. To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility to
anyone other than the company and the company’s members as a body, for our audit work, for this report, or for the opinions we
have formed.
Respective responsibilities of directors and auditors
The directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report and the directors’ remuneration report. As described on page 32, this
includes responsibility for preparing the financial statements in accordance with applicable United Kingdom law and accounting
standards. Our responsibilities, as independent auditors, are established in the United Kingdom by statute, the Auditing Practices
Board, the Listing Rules of the Financial Services Authority, and by our profession’s ethical guidance. 
We report to you our opinion as to whether the financial statements give a true and fair view and whether the financial statements
and the part of the directors’ remuneration report to be audited have been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act
1985. We also report to you if, in our opinion, the directors’ report is not consistent with the financial statements, if the company
has not kept proper accounting records, if we have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit, or if
information specified by law regarding directors’ remuneration and transactions with the group is not disclosed.
We review whether the statement on pages 32 to 35 reflects the company’s compliance with the seven provisions of the Combined
Code specified for our review by the Listing Rules, and we report if it does not. We are not required to consider whether the Board’s
statements on internal control cover all risks and controls, or form an opinion on the effectiveness of the group’s corporate
governance procedures or its risk and control procedures.
We read the other information contained in the Annual Report, including the corporate governance statement and the unaudited part
of the directors’ remuneration report, and consider whether it is consistent with the audited financial statements. We consider the
implications for our report if we become aware of any apparent misstatements or material inconsistencies with the financial
statements. 
Basis of audit opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with Auditing Standards issued by the Auditing Practices Board. An audit includes
examination, on a test basis, of evidence relevant to the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements and the part of the
directors’ remuneration report to be audited. It also includes an assessment of the significant estimates and judgements made by
the directors in the preparation of the financial statements, and of whether the accounting policies are appropriate to the group’s
circumstances, consistently applied and adequately disclosed.
We planned and performed our audit so as to obtain all the information and explanations which we considered necessary in order to
provide us with sufficient evidence to give reasonable assurance that the financial statements and the part of the directors’
remuneration report to be audited are free from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or other irregularity or error. In
forming our opinion we also evaluated the overall adequacy of the presentation of information in the financial statements and the
part of the directors’ remuneration report to be audited.
Opinion
In our opinion:
• the financial statements give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the company and the group as at 31 December 2003
and of the profit of the group for the year then ended; and 
• the financial statements and the part of the directors’ remuneration report to be audited have been properly prepared in
accordance with the Companies Act 1985.

Basis of preparation
The accounts are drawn up in accordance with applicable accounting standards under the historical cost convention as modified by
the revaluation of certain land and buildings and the treatment adopted in respect of the valuation of certain current asset
investments (see note 17).
The addition of Application Note G ‘Revenue Recognition’ to Financial Reporting Standard 5 – Reporting the substance of
transactions (FRS 5) has not impacted the reported results and no adjustment to the recognition of revenue and profit has been
necessary.
Following the issuance of Urgent Issues Task Force Abstract 38 – Accounting for ESOP trusts (UITF 38) the group has amended its
accounting policy for such trusts. This has resulted in the reclassification of own shares held as a deduction from shareholders’
funds and the restatement of comparative figures as set out in note 24 on page 78. 
As required by the Companies Act 1985, the directors have adopted the true and fair override in respect of the accounting for the
Exchange Property (see note 17).
Basis of consolidation
The accounts of the group consolidate the results of the company and its subsidiary undertakings, and include its share of its joint
ventures’ results on the gross equity method, all of which are made up to 31 December.
The acquisition method of accounting has been adopted for businesses acquired with fair values applied to the acquired operation.
The results of such businesses are included in the consolidated profit and loss account from the date of acquisition, up to the date
of disposal or closure.
From 1 January 2002, where the group contributes a business, or other non-monetary asset for an interest in a subsidiary, joint
venture or associate, such transactions are recorded so that the reduction in ownership of the business being contributed is
accounted for as a disposal while the increased interest in the enlarged group or new interest in the business contributed by other
parties to the transaction are accounted for as an acquisition. Fair values are applied to those operations which are subject to the
exchange and which have not previously been held within the group. Any loss or realised gain resulting from the transaction is
recorded in the profit and loss account while any unrealised gain is recorded in the statement of total recognised gains and losses.
Prior to 31 December 2001 such exchanges of interest were recorded so as to reflect the economic substance of the transaction.
Goodwill
Goodwill arising on consolidation, on an exchange of interest, or on acquisition of joint venture interests, is capitalised in respect of
all transactions from 1 January 1998. Such goodwill is amortised on a straight line basis through the profit and loss account over
its estimated useful economic life, based upon assessments of the durability of markets, product ranges and projected future
profitability of the businesses concerned. Prior to 1998, goodwill was either capitalised and amortised through the profit and loss
account or was written off directly to reserves depending upon the circumstances of each acquisition. To date all goodwill capitalised
has been assessed as having a 20 year estimated useful economic life.
Impairment reviews are undertaken at the end of the first full financial year following each acquisition and also if events or changes
in circumstance indicate that such a review is necessary.
On the subsequent disposal or termination of a previously acquired business, the profit and loss on disposal or termination is
calculated including any remaining capitalised goodwill or the gross amount of any related goodwill previously written off directly to
reserves, as appropriate.
Company accounts
In the company’s accounts, all fixed asset investments (including subsidiary undertakings and joint ventures) are stated at cost (or
valuation in respect of certain listed investments) less provisions for permanent diminutions. Dividends received and receivable are
credited to the company’s profit and loss account. In accordance with section 230(4) of the Companies Act 1985 the company is
exempt from the requirement to present its own profit and loss account. The amount of the profit for the financial year of the
company is disclosed in note 24 to these accounts.
Relief under sections 131 and 133 of the Companies Act 1985 is taken whenever possible. Accordingly the difference between the
fair value and aggregate nominal value of shares is not recognised in either shareholders’ funds or cost of investment.
1 Accounting policies
Notes to the accounts BAE SYSTEMS Annual report 2003 53
Revenue recognition
Sales are recognised when the group obtains the right to consideration in exchange for its performance, this is usually when title
passes or a separately identifiable phase of a contract or development has been completed and accepted by the customer. Sales
comprise the net value of such deliveries made, work completed or services rendered during the year and include the group’s net
share of sales of joint ventures. Turnover represents sales made by the company and its subsidiary undertakings, excluding the
group’s share of sales of joint ventures.
Profit is recognised at the time of sale. In the case of contracts with extended delivery programmes, it is arrived at by reference to
the estimated overall profitability of the contract and appropriate provision is made for any losses in the year in which they are first
foreseen.
Foreign currencies
Transactions in overseas currencies are translated at the exchange rate ruling at the date of the transaction or, where forward cover
contracts have been arranged, at the contracted rates. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are
retranslated at the exchange rates ruling at the balance sheet date or at a contracted rate if applicable and any exchange
differences arising are taken to the profit and loss account.
For consolidation purposes the assets and liabilities of overseas subsidiary undertakings and joint ventures are translated at the
closing exchange rates. Profit and loss accounts of such undertakings are consolidated at the average rates of exchange during the
year. Exchange differences arising on foreign currency net investments are taken to reserves.
Research and development
Group funded revenue expenditure on research and development is written off as incurred and charged to the profit and loss
account, except where substantially supported under contract.
Tangible fixed assets
Depreciation is provided, normally on a straight line basis, to write off the cost or valuation of tangible fixed assets over their
estimated useful economic lives to any estimated residual value, using the following rates:
Buildings — up to 50 years, or the lease term if shorter
Research equipment — 8 years
Computing equipment, motor vehicles 
and short life works equipment — 3 to 5 years
Other equipment — 10 to 15 years, or the project life if shorter
In the group’s North America business, depreciation is normally provided on a basis consistent with cost reimbursement profiles
under US government contracts. Typically this provides for a faster rate of depreciation than would otherwise arise on a straight line
basis.
No depreciation is provided on freehold land and assets in the course of construction.
Impairment reviews are undertaken if there are indications that the carrying values may not be recoverable.
Leases
Assets obtained under finance leases are included in tangible fixed assets at cost and are depreciated over their useful economic
lives, or the term of their lease, whichever is shorter. Future instalments under such leases, net of finance charges, are included
within loans. Rental payments are apportioned between the finance element, which is charged as interest to the profit and loss
account, and the capital element, which reduces the outstanding obligation for future instalments, so as to give a constant rate of
charge on the outstanding obligation.
Rental payments under operating leases are charged to the profit and loss account on a straight line basis in arriving at operating
profit.
Assets held for leasing out under operating leases are included in tangible fixed assets at cost less depreciation. Rental income
from aircraft operating leases is recognised in sales as the receipts fall due.
1 Accounting policies (continued) 54 BAE SYSTEMS Annual report 2003
1 Accounting policies (continued)
Stocks
Stocks are stated at the lower of cost, including all relevant overhead expenditure, and net realisable value.
Long-term contracts – the amount of profit attributable to the stage of completion of a long-term contract is arrived at by reference
to the estimated overall profitability of the contract. Appropriate provisions are made for any losses in the year in which they are first
foreseen. Work in progress relating to long-term contracts is stated at cost less provision for anticipated losses.
Development properties – the net realisable value is based on advice received from independent valuers and assumes the grant of
relevant planning consent but excludes any development profit.
Cash received on customers’ account and customer stage payments
Amounts received from customers in accordance with the terms of contracts which specify payments in advance of delivery are
credited, as progress payments, against any expenditure incurred upon stocks or work in progress for the particular contract. Any
unexpended balance is held in creditors as customer stage payments or, if the amounts are subject to advance payment guarantees
unrelated to company performance, as cash received on customers’ account. Cash received on customers’ account is excluded from
the figure for net debt as defined by the group.
Aircraft financing
The group is exposed to actual and contingent liabilities arising from commercial aircraft financing, both from financing arranged
directly by the group and from that arranged by third parties where the group has provided guarantees or has other recourse
obligations. Provision for these risks is made on a systematic basis.
Financial instruments
The group uses derivative financial instruments to hedge its exposures to fluctuations in interest and foreign exchange rates.
Instruments accounted for as hedges are designated as a hedge at the inception of contracts. Receipts and payments on interest
rate instruments are recognised on an accruals basis, over the life of the instrument. Gains and losses on foreign currency hedges
are recognised on maturity of the underlying transaction, other than translational hedges of foreign currency investments which are
taken to reserves. Gains and losses arising from retiming of foreign exchange transactional cover are deferred to match the maturity
of the underlying exposure. Gains or losses arising on hedging instruments which are cancelled due to the termination of underlying
exposure are taken to the profit and loss account immediately. Finance costs associated with debt issuances are charged to the
profit and loss account over the life of the instruments.
Short-term debtors and creditors that meet the definition of a financial asset or liability respectively have been excluded from the
Financial Reporting Standard 13 – Derivatives and other financial instruments (FRS 13) disclosures where permitted by that
standard.
Tax
The charge for taxation is based on the profit for the year and takes account of taxation deferred because of timing differences
between the treatment of certain items for taxation and accounting purposes. Deferred tax is recognised on an undiscounted basis
in respect of all timing differences between the treatment of certain items for taxation and accounting purposes which have arisen
but not reversed by the balance sheet date where there is an obligation to pay more tax, or a right to pay less tax, in the future.
Pensions and other post retirement benefits
These costs have been provided under Statement of Standard Accounting Practice 24 – Accounting for pension costs (SSAP 24)
where the expected cost of providing pensions and other post retirement benefits, as calculated periodically by independent
actuaries, is charged to the profit and loss account so as to spread the cost over the expected average remaining service lives of
current employees. The group operates several pension schemes providing benefits based on final pensionable pay. The assets of
the schemes are held separately from those of the group.
The group has followed the transitional disclosure arrangements required by Financial Reporting Standard 17 – Retirement benefits
(FRS 17).
Share options
In accordance with Urgent Issues Task Force Abstract 25 – National insurance contributions on share option gains (UITF 25) the
group provides in full for the employer’s national insurance liability estimated to arise on the future exercise of share options
granted, except where the employee has agreed to settle the employer’s national insurance liability as a condition of the grant of the
options.
The group has taken advantage of the exemption offered in Urgent Issues Task Force Abstract 17 – Employee share schemes
(UITF 17) from charging to the profit and loss account the 20% discount offered to employees partaking in such company operated
SAYE schemes.
As required under Urgent Issues Task Force Abstract 38 – Accounting for ESOP trusts (UITF 38) the cost to the company of own
shares held is now shown as a deduction from shareholders’ funds. Consideration paid or received for the purchase or sale of the
company’s own shares in the ESOP trust is shown separately in the reconciliation of movements in shareholders’ funds.

Contract loss provisions
The contract loss provisions incurred in 2002 related to the Nimrod (charge of £500m before tax credit of £150m) and Astute (charge of
£250m before tax credit of £28m) programmes. These provisions recognised fully the consequence of delays on the Nimrod programme
and the residual design and development risks on both programmes. The provisions were set off against the long-term contract balances
held in stock on these programmes.
As the provisions were transferred to stock the net cash outflow arising in 2003 in respect of these exceptional charges has not been
separately recorded.

Notes to the accounts (continued) BAE SYSTEMS Annual report 2003 59
Prior year rationalisation programmes
Rationalisation programmes were initiated in 1999 and 2000 in response to capacity excesses across a number of business groups.
The total costs associated with these programmes were estimated at the time of the respective announcements at £475m. To date costs
of £500m have been recorded as exceptional charges. The profit and loss impact in 2003 has been a charge of £6m (2002 £45m), before
a tax credit of £2m (2002 £12m). The net cash outflow in 2003 amounted to £4m (2002 £52m), before taking into account the cash
benefits of tax relief.
BAe/MES integration costs
Costs associated with the integration of the former MES and British Aerospace businesses incurred in 2003 amounted to £3m (2002
£2m), before a tax credit of £1m (2002 £1m). The net cash outflow in 2003 amounted to £3m (2002 £2m), before taking into account the
cash benefits of tax relief.

Cessation/reorganisation of commercial aerospace activities
In 2001, the group decided to close its regional jet manufacturing operations and reorganise certain other commercial aerospace activities
at a cost of £400m. An amount of £370m, before a tax credit of £111m, was charged to the profit and loss account in 2001 and the
remaining £30m, before a tax credit of £9m, charged in 2002. The cash outflow in 2003 in respect of these prior year exceptional charges
was £62m (2002 £155m), before taking into account the cash benefits of tax relief.
Sale of operations
In 2002, the group disposed of its Advanced Systems’ Gaithersburg operation in the US resulting in an exceptional gain of £50m,
reported in the North America business group.
Also in 2002, the group disposed of the Heckler & Koch small arms business resulting in an exceptional loss of £48m including
goodwill of £32m previously written off to reserves, reported in HQ and other businesses.
Fixed asset disposals
The exceptional gain of £28m in 2002, reported in HQ and other businesses, resulted from the disposal of certain of the group’s
surplus properties arising from the prior year rationalisation programmes referred to above.

Earnings per share is calculated by reference to earnings excluding goodwill amortisation and impairment and exceptional items in
addition to that required by Financial Reporting Standard 14 – Earnings per share (FRS 14) as the directors consider that this gives
a more appropriate indication of underlying performance.
In accordance with FRS 14 the diluted earnings per share calculations are without reference to adjustments in respect of options
and preference shares, as assumed conversion would be anti-dilutive.

Acquisitions
MEVATEC Corporation
In March 2003, the group acquired 100% of MEVATEC Corporation, in the US, for a cash consideration of £52m (excluding cash acquired of
£11m). Provisional goodwill arising on consolidation amounted to £48m. The company provides professional technical services to the US
market and has been renamed BAE Systems Analytical Solutions.
Advanced Power Technologies, Inc.
In March 2003, the group acquired 100% of Advanced Power Technologies, Inc., in the US, for a total cash consideration of £18m.
Provisional goodwill arising on consolidation amounted to £15m. The company provides communications and networking solutions to the US
market and has been renamed BAE Systems Advanced Technologies.
Piper Group Plc
In April 2003, the group acquired 100% of Piper Group Plc for a total cash consideration of £3m. Provisional goodwill arising on
consolidation amounted to £3m. The company provides technology services.
Exchange of interests – Atlas Elektronik
In August 2003, agreement was reached on the final separation of the STN Atlas business, whereby the group’s 49% joint venture interest
in STN Atlas was exchanged for a 100% interest in its naval systems business, Atlas Elektronik. BAE Systems has held full control of the
naval business since 1 January 2003, so this has been deemed the date of the transaction for accounting purposes.
A provisional unrealised gain arising from this exchange of interests of £11m has been taken directly to reserves, in accordance with
UITF 31 (see note 24).
Adjustment to provisional fair values
Post acquisition fair value adjustments of £11m have been made in respect of Corbett Technologies, Inc. and Condor Pacific
Industries, Inc. which were acquired in November 2002 and December 2002 respectively. These relate to the identification of
deferred tax assets which have increased net assets acquired and consequently reduced goodwill on acquisition.
Charge for the year
The charge for the year of £403m includes £20m impairment of goodwill relating to the Precision Aerostructures business within
Commercial Aerospace.
Goodwill arising on joint ventures is set out in note 12.

11 Tangible fixed assets (continued)
Land and buildings comprise:
• freehold and long leasehold land and buildings owned by the group as at 30 June 1996, excluding certain overseas properties,
revalued at that date. The majority of the group’s operational properties at that time were valued on a depreciated replacement
basis, owing to their specialisation, with the remainder on an existing use value basis. Other non-operational properties were
valued on the basis of open market value;
• short leaseholds at cost;
• additions subsequent to 30 June 1996 at cost; and
• land and buildings owned by subsidiary undertakings acquired since 30 June 1996 at fair value at the date of acquisition.
Following the adoption in 2000 of Financial Reporting Standard 15 – Tangible fixed assets (FRS 15) the company has elected that
no further revaluation of land and buildings will be undertaken for statutory reporting purposes.

Acquisition
During the year, Roxel, a joint venture owned 50% by MBDA, acquired the Rocket Motors business of RO Defence. A transfer between share
of net assets of £13m and goodwill has been made to reflect the goodwill arising on this transaction, which has been adjusted by £4m to
reflect the unrealised element of the gain on disposal recorded by RO Defence.
Exchange of interests
The exchange of interests relates to the exchange of the group’s 49% joint venture interest in STN Atlas for a 100% interest in Atlas
Elektronik (see note 10).
Disposal
During the year the group disposed of its 27.5% holding in Astrium for nil consideration.

Additions
The principal addition in the year was a holding of 31,882,534 shares, representing approximately 29% of the issued share capital,
in Alvis plc which were acquired from GKN plc for £73m, before costs, in cash (equivalent to 230p per Alvis share) on 2 September
2003.
BAE Systems does not actively participate in the management and financial decision-making of Alvis and hence does not exercise
the significant influence which would require treatment of its holding as an associate under the equity accounting method. The
holding is therefore accounted for as a trade investment.
The market value of the shares held on 31 December 2003 was £55m. In the opinion of the directors the consideration paid
reflects the long-term value of the business and the investment carrying value is not impaired. Accordingly, the investment is held at
its historic cost.

Company Group
Company Group 70 BAE SYSTEMS Annual report 2003
17 Exchangeable Bonds and Exchange Property
The company has in issue £676m (2002 £676m) 3.75% Senior Unsecured Exchangeable Bonds (the Bonds), due in 2006. At any
time prior to the due date the Bondholders have the right to request to exchange their Bonds for the Exchange Property, which is
represented by the group’s holding in the ordinary share capital of Vodafone Group Plc (see note 15). On receiving such early
redemption notice, the company has the option to settle the Bonds in cash, based on the prevailing market value of the Exchange
Property. The company does not intend currently to use this option to settle any material proportion of the Bonds in cash.
The Bonds are recorded at issue price less unamortised issue costs, which represent the maximum economic exposure.
The value of the Exchange Property was initially based on the issue price of the Bonds, which represented the realisable value to
the group. The historical cost of the Exchange Property to the group is negligible, and the uplift to match the Exchange Property to
the value of the Bonds was recorded as an unrealised gain within other reserves.
This treatment of the Exchange Property represents a departure from the normal requirements of the Companies Act 1985 under
which current asset investments are to be carried at the lower of cost and net realisable value. This basis would, for the reasons
set out above, in the opinion of the directors not reflect the economic substance of the transaction nor show a true and fair view.
At 31 December 2003 the value of the group’s holding in Vodafone Group Plc was less than the redemption value of the Bonds.
Accordingly the group has recorded the value of the Exchange Property at its market value at that date.
Movements in the market value of the Exchange Property have been offset against the original unrealised gain within other reserves,
and disclosed as a non-cash adjustment in the consolidated movement on net debt.

Contracts and other
In respect of ongoing contracts, appropriate provisions are made for any losses in the year in which they are first foreseen. The
associated outflows are estimated to occur over the period of the contract, normally between one and five years.
Other provisions include legal costs, insurance and environmental commitments.
Warranties and after-sales service
Warranties and after-sales service are provided in the normal course of business with provisions for associated costs being made
based on an assessment of future claims with reference to past experience. Such costs are generally incurred within one to five
years post delivery.
Reorganisations – ongoing operations
The provision relates to 2003 and prior year rationalisation programmes.
Regional aircraft
This provision contains the costs associated with the decision in 2001 to close the regional jet aircraft activities, principally
manufacturing, and reorganise certain other commercial aerospace activities (see note 6) and recourse provisions in respect of
financing arrangements for aircraft previously sold by the group.
The recourse element of the provision covers costs to be incurred over the period to 2013 and the directors believe it is appropriate
to state the recourse provision at its net present value. Adjustments to the net present value are recorded within other provision
movements.
Provisions arising from exchange of interests
The amount arising from exchange of interests represents provisions held by Atlas Elektronik at 1 January 2003 (see note 10).
Other provision movements
Reclassifications between provision categories are reported within other provision movements.
Company
The company has a deferred tax provision of £nil (2002 £3m).

The group has provided guarantees in respect of residual values or head lease and finance payments in respect of certain
commercial aircraft sold. At 31 December 2003 the group’s future payments in respect of these arrangements were £2,717m
(2002 £3,077m).
As part of a restructuring of its gross obligations through the issue of a limited recourse bond in 2001, the group pre-financed
certain of the residual value guarantees.
The future cash flows associated with this pre-financing totalled £594m at 31 December 2003 (2002 £740m). 
A significant proportion of the net exposure of £2,123m (2002 £2,337m) is covered by a Financial Risk Insurance Programme (FRIP)
which provides insurance cover in respect of potential shortfalls in contracted and expected income. Any anticipated liability in
respect of uninsured amounts is accounted for on a net present value basis.
Since the inception of the FRIP , the group has granted residual value guarantees in respect of aircraft sold totalling £400m (2002
£375m). After taking account of independent appraisal valuations the directors consider that the group’s net exposure to these
guarantees is covered by the provisions held, on a net present value basis, and the residual values of the related aircraft.
The group is also exposed to actual and contingent liabilities arising from commercial aircraft financing and residual value
guarantees given by Saab AB and Airbus SAS. Provision is made against the expected net exposures on a net present value basis.
The group’s share of such exposure is limited to its percentage shareholding in each of these joint ventures.

Guarantees and performance bonds
The group and company have entered into a number of guarantee and performance bond arrangements in the normal course of
business. Provision is made for any amounts that the directors consider may become payable under such arrangements.

The group has unprovided deferred tax assets relating to tax losses, accelerated capital allowances and other short-term timing
differences, the net tax effect of which is £149m (2002 £90m). These assets have not been recognised as the precise incidence of
future profits in the relevant countries and legal entities cannot be sufficiently accurately predicted at this time.
No deferred tax has been provided in respect of future remittances of the accumulated reserves of overseas subsidiary
undertakings and joint ventures as there are no binding agreements entered into by the subsidiaries and joint ventures to distribute
these past earnings.
No significant potential liability to tax is expected to arise if properties included at valuation in the accounts were realised at their
revalued amounts. In respect of rolled over capital gains the potential year end liability amounted to £26m (2002 £26m).
A deferred tax provision of £3m has been released (2002 creation £3m) in relation to the company (note 19).

One Special Share of £1 in the company is held on behalf of the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry (the ‘Special
Shareholder’). Certain parts of the company’s Articles of Association cannot be amended without the consent of the Special
Shareholder. These Articles include the requirement that no foreign person, or foreign persons acting in concert, can have an
interest in more than 15% of the company, the requirement that the majority of the directors are British, and the requirement that
the chief executive and any executive chairman are British citizens. The effect of these requirements can also be amended by
regulations made by the directors and approved by the Special Shareholder.
The Special Shareholder may require the company at any time to redeem the Special Share at par or to convert the Special Share
into one ordinary voting share. The Special Shareholder is entitled to receive notice of and to attend general meetings and class
meetings of the company’s shareholders but has no voting right, nor other rights, other than to speak in relation to any business in
respect of the Special Share.
The 7.75p (net) cumulative redeemable preference shares of 25p each are convertible into ordinary shares of 2.5p each at the
option of the holder on 31 May in any of the years up to 2007, on the basis of 0.47904 ordinary shares for every preference share.
During the year 15,116 shares were converted for 7,241 ordinary shares.
The company may redeem all of the remaining preference shares at any time after 1 July 2007 and, in any case, will redeem any
remaining shares on 1 January 2010, in each case at 100p per share together with any arrears and accruals of dividend. The
maximum redemption value of the preference shares, ignoring any arrears or accruals of dividends, is therefore £266m and this
amount has been disclosed on the face of the balance sheet as the total of non-equity shareholders’ funds.
The preference shares carry voting rights at a general meeting of the company only where the preferential dividend is six months or
more in arrears, or where a motion is to be proposed which abrogates, varies or modifies the rights of the preference shareholders,
or where a motion is to be proposed for the winding up of the company. On a winding up, holders of the preference shares are
entitled, after repayment of the capital paid up on the Special Share and in priority to any payment to any other class of shareholder,
to the return of amounts paid up or credited as paid up on the preference shares together with a premium of 75p per share, and all
arrears of preferential dividends.

Prior year adjustment for Urgent Issues Task Force Abstract 38 – Accounting for ESOP trusts (UITF 38)
In previous years the group had complied with UITF Abstract 13 – Accounting for ESOP trusts (UITF 13) which has been superseded
by the introduction of UITF 38. UITF 13 required own shares held by the group through an ESOP trust to be included within fixed
asset investments. UITF 38 requires such shares to be shown as a deduction in arriving at shareholders’ funds.
The effect of the implementation of UITF 38 has been to reduce the value of fixed asset investments, within net assets, and
shareholders funds, reported at 31 December 2003 by £9m (2002 £11m; 2001 £13m) for both the group and the company.
Qualifying Employee Share Ownership Trust (QUEST)
During the year the group ceased operation of the Qualifying Employee Share Ownership Trust (QUEST) previously operated for the
purposes, inter alia, of the SAYE Share Option Scheme (1993). No contributions were made by the company to the QUEST during the
year and no shares were held by the QUEST at any point during the year.

Owing to the timing of the finalisation of the group financial statements, it is sometimes necessary to estimate the closing balances
relating to minority interests in respect of the group’s joint ventures. The reclassification adjusts the estimated balance to the actual
position at 1 January 2003.
2002 2003 80 BAE SYSTEMS Annual report 2003
27 Post retirement benefit schemes
The group has continued to account for pensions in accordance with SSAP 24 and the disclosures given in (a) are those required by
that standard. FRS 17 was issued in November 2000 but the Accounting Standards Board has deferred full mandatory
implementation, which is now not expected before the year ending 31 December 2005 at the earliest. Prior to this, transitional
disclosures are required which, to the extent they are not given in note (a), are set out in (b).
(a) Pension schemes
The group operates pension schemes in the UK and overseas. The main schemes are funded defined benefit schemes and the
assets are held in separate trustee administered funds. Pension scheme valuations are regularly carried out by independent
actuaries to determine pension costs for pension funding, SSAP 24 and FRS 17 purposes.
The details of the principal schemes, their respective latest valuation dates, and the financial assumptions used for the SSAP 24
valuations are given below.

Principal assumptions used in the valuations for the UK schemes were that in the long term the average return on investments
would exceed:
2003 2002
% %
Average increases in pay by 2.00 to 3.00 2.00 to 3.00

Valuation

US schemes
BAE SYSTEMS Projected Unit
Employee Retirement Plan No 1 1 January 2003
As permitted under SSAP 24 the US schemes have been accounted for under the Financial Accounting Standards Board’s Statement
of Financial Accounting Standards No. 87 Employers’ accounting for pensions.
Principal assumptions used in the valuations for the US schemes were that in the long-term the average return on investments
would be 8.75% (2002 9.00%) and average increases in pay would be 5.42% (2002 5.42%).
The aggregate of the market values of the assets of the principal schemes operated by the group at the latest date of actuarial
valuation totalled some £9.7bn (2002 £9.7bn). The actuarial value of these assets covered approximately 100% (2002 101%) of
the benefits that had accrued to members after allowing for expected future increases in wages and salaries. The market value of
these assets at 31 December 2003 was approximately £9.1bn (2002 £8.0bn).
The net deficit is being amortised using the straight line method over the estimated average service lives of the related scheme
members of 9 to 14 years. The net charge to the profit and loss account amounted to £127m (2002 £118m), excluding charges in
respect of the contributions made by the group’s joint venture companies.
Notes to the accounts (continued) BAE SYSTEMS Annual report 2003 81
Pension prepayments included in debtors of the group amounted to £532m (2002 £434m) (note 14) and pension liabilities included
in creditors of the group amounted to £107m (note 18). Cash contributions by the group to the pension schemes totalled £233m
(2002 £156m). In addition, £62m (2002 £57m) of cash contributions were received into the various schemes from joint venture
companies.
The group also incurred a charge in respect of the cash contributions of £32m (2002 £31m) paid to defined contribution pension
schemes for certain employees.
As a result of the consolidation of the group’s interest in Atlas Elektronik GmbH, following the exchange of interests detailed in
note 10, a charge of £2m has also been incurred, with cash paid of £2m for pensions under this company’s unfunded pension
arrangements. The estimated future liabilities as at 31 December 2003 totalled £49m and are included in the balance for pensions
within creditors referred to above. This scheme has been accounted for under the International Accounting Standards Board’s
International Accounting Standard No. 19 - Employee benefits (IAS 19).
The group’s pension funding requirements are derived from separate independent actuarial valuations required by the company and
the trustees of the various schemes.
Post retirement benefits other than pensions
The group also operates a number of non-pension post retirement benefit plans, under which certain employees are eligible to
receive benefits after retirement, the majority of which relate to the provision of medical benefits to retired employees of the group’s
subsidiaries in the US. These schemes are generally unfunded. The latest valuations of the principal schemes, covering retiree
medical and life insurance plans in certain US subsidiaries, were performed by independent actuaries as at 1 January 2003. The
method of accounting for these is similar to that used for defined benefit pension schemes. The gross liability at 31 December
2003 amounts to £68m (2002 £74m), all of which is held within provisions (note 19).
(b) Transitional FRS 17 disclosure
The disclosures below relate principally to post retirement benefit schemes in the UK and the US accounted for on a defined benefit
basis under FRS 17. The valuations used for the FRS 17 disclosures are based on the most recent actuarial valuation undertaken
by independent qualified actuaries and updated to take account of the requirements of FRS 17 in order to assess the
surplus/deficit of the schemes at 31 December each year. Scheme assets are stated at the market value at 31 December each
year and scheme liabilities are based on the results of the last actuarial valuation.
The financial assumptions used to calculate liabilities for the schemes were:

The assumptions used by the actuaries are estimates chosen from a range of possible actuarial assumptions which, due to the
timescale covered, may not necessarily be borne out in practice. The fair value of scheme assets, which are not intended to be
realised in the short-term and may be subject to significant change before they are realised, and the present value of scheme
liabilities, which are derived from cash flow projections over long periods and thus inherently uncertain, as at 31 December were:

Certain of the group’s joint venture companies contribute to the group’s defined benefit pension schemes. As these are 
multi-employer schemes it is not possible to separately identify the joint venture’s share of the underlying assets and liabilities. In
consequence, the joint ventures account for the schemes on a defined contribution basis. The group accounts reflect 100% of the
movements on, and balances in, the scheme, net of the contributions received from the joint ventures. Contributions received from
joint venture companies include £6m in respect of Astrium, pending agreement of the liabilities and assets to be transferred
following its disposal in January 2003.

Company schemes
Employees of the company are members of various of the group’s defined benefit schemes. These are all multi-employer schemes
and as such, the company is unable to identify its share of the underlying assets and liabilities of the schemes on a consistent and
reasonable basis. As permitted by FRS 17, the schemes will be accounted for as if they were defined contribution schemes when
the financial reporting standard is fully adopted by the company and therefore no transitional disclosures are required. The schemes
are included in the FRS 17 disclosures set out above.

30 Financial instruments
A discussion of the group’s treasury objectives and policies and the use of financial instruments can be found in the operating and
financial review and the directors’ report. Financial instruments comprise net borrowings (note 16) together with other instruments
deemed to be financial instruments under FRS 13 including long-term debtors, long-term creditors and provisions for liabilities and
charges. Disclosures dealt with in this note exclude short-term debtors and creditors where permitted by FRS 13 except for the
analysis of net currency exposures.
Interest rate risk management
At 31 December 2003, after taking account of interest rate swaps and cross currency swaps, the currency and interest rate profile
of the financial assets and liabilities of the group was as follows:

Floating rate financial assets attract interest at short-term interbank rates. The weighted average period until maturity for financial
assets on which no interest is paid is two to five years.
Fixed rate financial assets have a weighted average interest rate of 7.72% (2002 7.29%) and a weighted average period to maturity
of 11 years (2002 11 years).
Interest bearing financial assets comprise cash, money market deposits, certain fixed asset investments and debtors. Financial
assets on which no interest is paid include certain current asset investments and debtors.

Interest bearing financial liabilities comprise bonds, commercial papers issued, net obligations under finance leases and bank
overdrafts. Financial liabilities on which no interest is paid primarily comprise long-term creditors and provisions for liabilities and
charges.
Maturity of financial liabilities
Non-equity shares are redeemable on 1 January 2010. The maturity profile of loans and borrowings is set out in note 16. For the
other financial liabilities, note 19 gives an indication of the underlying liabilities which in general cover a period of between one and
five years from the balance sheet date.

Hedges
Gains and losses on instruments used for hedging are not recognised until the exposure that is being hedged is itself recognised.
The table below shows the extent to which the group has unrecognised gains and losses on financial instruments in respect of
financial instruments used as hedges at the beginning and end of the year.

Interest rate management
The group’s current interest rate management strategy is that a minimum of 25% and a maximum of 75% of debt is maintained at
fixed interest rates. 
Currency management
The company’s principal currency exposure is the USdollar/£sterling exchange rate. Following the formation of Airbus SAS, the
USdollar exposure arising from the sale of Airbus aircraft has been managed through the joint shareholder treasury committee.
Hedging decisions have to be unanimously approved by the shareholders in this committee.
BAE Systems continues to hedge its forecast five-year USdollar transactional and economic exposures. The group also has
transactional currency exposure arising from exports/supplies denominated in currencies other than the USdollar. The group’s policy
is to hedge such exposures where appropriate using forward contracts. 
Liquidity management
At 31 December 2003, the group had undrawn revolving credit facilities (RCF) of £2bn (2002 £1.97bn), of which £nil expire in less
than one year (2002 £469m), £500m expire in more than one year but less than two years (2002 £1,000m) and £1,500m expire in
more than two years but less than five years (2002 £500m). The group’s commercial paper programme is supported by the RCF
with any amount outstanding reducing the amount that can be drawn down. As at 31 December 2003, £79m (2002 £255m) was
outstanding under the commercial paper programme.
31 Related party transactions
The group has an interest in a number of joint ventures, the principal ones of which are disclosed in note 12. Transactions occur
with these joint ventures in the normal course of business. The more significant transactions are disclosed below:

having grown sales 10% last year, the year ended 31 August 2011 has been extremely challenging, 
both in terms of the economy and the Group’s response to it.
t he principal factor has been the worsening economic outlook over the year accompanied by 
an unprecedented slowdown in consumer demand, particularly in the uK. t he fall in consumer 
confidence has had a detrimental impact, particularly in Armour home, where the exposure to 
consumer electronics and entertainment products is greatest.
in response, the Group has undertaken a restructuring programme, the key aspects of which are:
• Merger of the companies within Armour home into one business,
• closure of the chinese manufacturing operation,
• staff reduction of 75,
• Reduction of third party distribution to re-focus on core brands, customers and channels,
• c ontinued development of award winning products,
• Re-establish margins on the quality product portfolio.
t he Group’s results for the year reflect this year of change both in reduced sales and the costs 
incurred in restructuring.

Business Review
the deterioration in consumer confidence caused by the weak economic 
environment, particularly in the uK, has made the year to 31 August 2011 the 
most challenging experienced by the Group. Group sales fell to £42.3 million 
(2010: £56.6 million), which generated a loss from operations before 
exceptional items and discontinued operations of £1.7 million (2010: profit 
£1.2 million). the basic loss per ordinary share, before exceptional items and 
discontinued operations, was 1.8p (2010: earnings per ordinary share 1.4p). 
the Group’s net debt at 31 August 2011 was £6.9 million (2010: £5.7 million).
the performance of the Group has been severely affected by the collapse in 
retail demand, which has been felt most particularly in our home division. 
w hilst the uK is not technically in a recession, the impact on consumer 
confidence of the steady stream of poor economic data has resulted in a 
dramatic fall in consumer demand. the consumer electronics sector, which is 
our core market and by its very nature exposed to discretionary expenditure, 
has felt the full force of this downturn in consumer demand. 
in response to the very difficult trading environment, the Group has 
implemented a restructuring of the home division and a cost reduction 
programme throughout all our operations, which has included the closure of 
our c hinese manufacturing facility. these cost reduction initiatives are 
expected to realise over £2.5 million in annualised savings. the major elements 
of the restructuring and cost reduction programmes are now complete and we 
have started the new financial year with a more streamlined structure and cost 
base, particularly in Armour home. 
w hilst Armour home has found the market conditions very challenging, 
Armour Automotive has enjoyed an encouraging recovery in its performance, 
with profits before exceptional items in the year increasing from £0.2 million to 
£0.8 million. in addition, our operations in Asia have continued to grow, with sales 
increasing by 99% to £1.1 million with every expectation that this will become a 
profitable operation in 2012.

the recovery in Armour Automotive has been driven by strong demand for 
in-vehicle audio solutions supplied into the commercial vehicle market and our 
range of Gps and GsM antennae. As with the home division, retail sales in the 
automotive aftermarket have declined, although this decline has not been as 
marked as in home electronics. we remain confident that Armour Automotive 
will continue its recovery in 2012.
As with all other parts of the businesses, expenditure on new product 
development has been carefully reviewed. however, despite the market 
difficulties, the Group has continued to invest in new product development and 
has launched a number of new products during the year including two new 
ranges of award winning Q Acoustics speakers. n ew product development 
remains a fundamental part of the Group strategy and we believe it is a key 
ingredient to drive sales and deliver a sustainable recovery in performance. 
this year has been very testing for our employees who have had to manage a 
considerable amount of change in a very short period of time. Despite this, they 
have worked with dedication and professionalism for the good of the Group. 
i would like to acknowledge the Board’s appreciation of their commitment 
and effort over the course of the year.
the economic outlook in our core markets continues to be uncertain and the 
prospects of a recovery in consumer confidence and demand in the near term 
remain weak. the actions taken by the Group have significantly reduced its 
cost base and we anticipate an improved performance in 2012.

the year to 31 August 2011 has been extremely challenging with a deteriorating 
economic environment undermining consumer confidence in many of the 
markets the Group supplies. this in turn has significantly reduced demand for 
our products, particularly so in our core market sector of uK retail consumer 
electronics. we have responded to this fall in demand by restructuring our 
business operations, closing our factory operation in c hina and cutting the 
Group operating costs by in excess of £2.5 million annually.
our home division, Armour home, which is most exposed to the retail sector, 
has borne the brunt of the collapse in consumer demand that has hit its target 
retail markets. As a result, it has been restructured, downsizing the business 
to reflect the change in the market conditions. this restructuring programme 
is now broadly complete.
our automotive division, Armour Automotive, has enjoyed a good year continuing 
the improvement reported last year and in the 2011 half year statement. 
increasing demand in its non-retail sales channels has more than compensated 
for a decline in sales into the retail aftermarket. we have also been prudent 
with regard to the cost base, reducing our operating costs in the retail sector 
of the business to counter the decline in sales through this channel.
strategically we have re-focused all business operations on our core brands, 
customers and sales channels. this has reduced our third party distribution 
activities to concentrate on those brands that have critical size, complement 
our existing product portfolio and customer base and can generate economies 
of scale from our operating infrastructure.

Armour home designs, develops and distributes a range of consumer 
products and accessories for the home, supplying the retail and house 
building markets primarily in the uK. in year to 31 August 2011, Armour home 
has faced considerable challenges as pressure on consumer confidence 
increased. Discretionary spend in the consumer electronics sector has been 
hit particularly hard. sales in the year fell 37% to £27 million resulting in an 
operating loss before exceptional costs of £1.1 million.
All the markets served by Armour home in 2011 have felt the impact of lower 
consumer confidence brought on by the economic downturn. the most 
noticeable has been in the retail sector, where a significant fall in consumer 
demand became increasingly evident after the half year. the house building 
sector has been a little more resilient, although demand remains well below 
prior years.
in response to the worsening market conditions, a major restructuring of 
the division was undertaken, which has now merged the two operating 
businesses of Armour home electronics and Alphason Designs into a single 
trading entity. this has streamlined all departmental functions and is expected 
to realise annual cost savings in excess of £2.2 million, with the single largest 
area of saving being the reduction in headcount from 176 to 122. in addition to 
cost reduction, there has been a targeted programme to re-establish gross 
margins, which have been eroded through competitive pricing pressure and 
promotional activity to drive sales volumes. this margin initiative, which 
includes price increases, has and continues to deliver improvement across 
almost all product categories to the benefit of the division’s overall 
performance. the restructuring programme has undoubtedly caused

disruption, which in turn has had a negative impact on the financial 
performance over and above that caused by the weak economic conditions. 
however, the programme was substantially complete by 31 August 2011 and 
the division has started the new financial year with a significantly lower cost 
base and an improving gross margin.
sales of our home automation systems and associated products declined 
during the year by 32%. Demand for our products in this market is directly 
related to new home building activity, which has remained doggedly subdued 
throughout the year, although there have been signs of some improvement 
over the recent months. the market has also changed with the advent of an 
increasing number of wireless products on the market, which have shifted 
demand away from the traditional professionally installed wired products. 
Armour home has recognised this change and wireless functionality has been 
introduced into the systemline multi-room products during the course of the 
year. l ooking forward, the product development programme includes the 
launch in 2012 of three new product ranges, including a new wireless platform, 
which we believe will open up new market areas for Armour home and help 
offset what is now expected to be another year of tepid demand.
sales into the uK retail channel have had a very hard year with a year-on-year 
decline of 41%. this was not helped by the poor weather in December 2010, 
although the underlying and principal issue has been the sudden and 
significant fall in consumer confidence and spending. hardest hit has been 
the audio-visual furniture brand Alphason, where sales are down 47%, 
which directly reflects the decline in sales of televisions. Many of our large 
retail customers were left with excess stocks following the football world c up 
and c hristmas in 2010 and given the rapid decline in consumer demand for 
televisions and associated accessories, these retailers have not re-ordered 
significant amounts of audio-visual furniture for most of 2011. sales of the 
division’s other core brands, QeD and Q Acoustics, were also down on the prior 
year with weaker demand being compounded by supply issues during the early 
part of the year. For the new financial year, we have introduced a number of 
new products including two award winning Q Acoustics speaker ranges, a new 
range of Alphason audio visual furniture and a refreshed and updated range of 
QeD cables. these new products will be important in stimulating demand in 
this sales channel in 2012.
in contrast to the sales decline in most retail product categories, Armour 
home’s office furniture range has performed well over 2011 with sales being 
13% up on the prior year. A new category in 2010, the division has consolidated 
its position in 2011 developing a good customer base from which it can further 
grow. we have also developed our customer service offering with a very 
successful “drop ship” delivery service for our retail customers whereby we 
deliver direct to the consumer from our warehouse. this service has grown 
significantly over the past year and we are now delivering over 4,000 parcels 
a month through this service.
w hilst our product development programme has been slowed, and there 
were fewer product launches in 2011, it remains very active and has recently 
delivered to market in october 2011 two w hat hi-Fi? sound and vision 
award winning speaker ranges in Q7000 and Q2000i. the awards included 
the prestigious “product of the year” for the Q7000 5.1 speaker package. 
Armour home also won a w hat hi-Fi? sound and vision award for QeD 
and two for Grado headphones.
Armour Home’ s office 
furniture range has 
performed well over 201 1 
with sales being 13% up 
on the prior year . A new 
category in 2010 the division 
has consolidated its position

Armour Automotive is the leading company in the uK and sweden supplying 
the automotive aftermarket and commercial vehicle market with connectivity 
solutions and audio-video equipment for in-vehicle applications. t he division’s 
recovery has continued throughout 2011 with sales up 8% to £14.4 million 
delivering an operating profit of £0.7 million for the year, a fourfold increase.
Armour Automotive’s progress has been based on an expanding commercial 
and leisure vehicle business where demand has continued to grow for our 
in-vehicle audio solutions. there has also been strong growth in sales of 
our ct i antennae range driven by a combination of both new products and an 
expanded customer base. the weakest area for Armour Automotive has been 
in the retail sales channel, where sales have declined against a background of 
an increasingly difficult consumer environment. Gross profit margins within the 
automotive division are marginally down on the prior year, reflecting the change 
in sales mix towards the non-retail sales channels which typically generate a 
lower gross margin.
in the uK retail sales channel, market conditions have remained challenging 
with sales declining 12% on the prior year. in part some of this decline relates 
to the poor weather in December 2010 and operational issues experienced 
by our largest customer at the start of the year. however, the overriding cause 
is the weakness of consumer demand in the face of the very tough economic 
conditions. As a consequence of the retail market conditions, retail operations 
were restructured to reduce the operating cost base relating to this channel. 
the outlook for the retail market remains uncertain and subdued. the current 
expectation is that the market will continue to contract over the coming year, 
although there are opportunities to win market share in existing markets and 
enter new market areas with new products planned for launch in the early 
part of 2012.
the non-retail business, which is primarily into the commercial and leisure 
vehicle and antennae markets, has had a very strong year with sales increasing 
50%. Demand from all our key customers grew, particularly in the agricultural 
vehicle and antennae markets. A number of new contracts have been secured 
and there has been increasing demand from the existing customer base as 
their own sales have been expanding. the new financial year has started well 
for this sales channel and with the prospect of a new audio platform for the 
agricultural vehicle market set for launch in early 2012, the outlook remains 
promising.
the i o range of in-vehicle Bluetooth music streaming and handsfree 
solutions has been disappointing in 2011 due to the delayed launch of the 
second generation product, which is now expected in the market in the first 
half of 2012. testing of this new platform, which is now well advanced, 
is encouraging and the reseller network is in place to accept the new 
generation product launch.
Armour n ordic, our business in scandinavia that forms part of Armour 
Automotive, continues to perform well with sales increasing by 6%. Further 
expansion of the product portfolio into the home market and a new distribution 
agreement with sony for in-car audio products has more than compensated for 
slowing market demand. the outlook for the n ordic region remains positive 
with sales growth expected in 2012 coming from a new distribution agreement 
in the home market with tDK and further new products planned within the 
division’s own proprietary brands.

Armour Asia represents the Group’s interests in Asia/pacific, both through 
selling our products in the region and acting as the liaison between the uK 
operations and our Far eastern manufacturing partners. sales in the region 
through Armour Asia are still relatively small, but are growing fast and 
increased by 99% to £1.1 million in the year to 31 August 2011. the largest and 
fastest growing market is c hina where we sell a range of the Group’s products 
into the retail and the hotel build markets. the region offers considerable 
expansion opportunities and the expectation is that sales will continue to grow.
in october 2010 the Group set up a factory operation in c hina assembling 
audio-visual furniture following strong sales indications from large uK retail 
customers. unfortunately, with the fast deteriorating economic conditions 
and the sudden and significant fall in consumer demand, the expected sales 
volumes from these customers did not materialise. As a consequence of this, 
we took the decision to close the factory, which we did at the end of May 2011. 
the cost to the Group in the year of the c hina factory operation and its closure 
was £0.5 million and has been disclosed as a discontinued operation in the

Reviews of the trading results for the year are set out in the Chairman’s Statement and Chief Executive’s Review, 
which form part of this Annual Report. 
Group sales for the year were £42.3 million (31 August 2010: £56.6 million), representing a 25% decrease on the 
comparative period last year. Armour Automotive’s sales increased by 8% and Armour Asia’s sales increased by 99%, 
but Armour Home’s sales fell by 37%. 
The Group’s underlying loss (being the loss from operations and before exceptional items) was £1.7 million (31 August 
2010: Profit of £1.2 million), which despite improvement in the performance of the other business segments reflects 
Armour Home’s severe reduction in sales demand.

Exceptional costs of £1.4 million were incurred in the year in a Group-wide restructuring and cost cutting programme, with 
particular emphasis on the Armour Home business segment, details of which are set out in Note 5 of the Consolidated 
Financial Statements. Net interest expense of £0.4 million (31 August 2010: £0.2 million) reflects the maturity of the 
previous five-year funding facilities and their replacement in December 2010 at interest rates that reflect the current 
market pricing. The Group’s loss before taxation from continuing operations was £3.5 million (31 August 2010: Profit of 
£0.9 million). 
The loss from discontinued operations, arising from the set up and subsequent closure of the dedicated manufacturing 
facility in China, was £0.5 million as set out in Note 6 of the Consolidated Financial Statements. 
TAXATION 
The total taxation credit for the year was £1.2 million (31 August 2010: Charge of £0.07 million), which reflects an effective 
taxation rate of 29% (31 August 2010: 8%). The reason for the effective rate to be higher (31 August 2010: Lower) from the 
expected rate of 27.2% (31 August 2010: 28%) is principally due to enhanced research and development relief as set out for 
both the current and prior year in Note 10 of the Consolidated Financial Statements. 
The expected taxation rate during the current year of 27.2% arises from the change in rate in April 2011 from 28% to 26%. 
EARNINGS PER SHARE AND DIVIDEND 
The basic loss per ordinary share was 3.7p (31 August 2010: Earnings of 1.4p), which includes the cost of both the 
exceptional items and discontinued operations. 
The basic underlying loss per ordinary share, which adjusts for discontinued operations, exceptional items and share-
based payments as set out in Note 11 of the Consolidated Financial Statements, was 1.8p (31 August 2010: Earnings of 
1.4p).  
The Board did not propose a dividend for the year ended 31 August 2010 and has not recommended a final dividend for the 
year ended 31 August 2011.   Armour Group plc

SHARE CAPITAL AND EQUITY 
At a general meeting held on 23 February 2011 it was resolved that each 10p ordinary share in issue be subdivided into one 
new ordinary share of 1p each and one deferred share of 9p each. Each authorised but unissued ordinary share was 
subdivided into 10 new ordinary shares of 1p each. On the same date, the Company issued 28,571,429 new ordinary shares 
of 1p each by way of a placing at 7p per share. At 31 August 2011 the issued share capital amounted to £7.1 million (31 
August 2010: £6.8 million) and further details are set out in Note 24 of the Consolidated Financial Statements.   
At 31 August 2011, the Group’s equity was £29.0 million (31 August 2010: £30.1 million) reflecting the placing of shares and 
the retained loss for the year of £2.9 million (31 August 2010: Retained profit of £0.9 million). This is set out in the 
Consolidated Statement of Changes in Shareholders’ Equity on page 36.   
FUNDING AND BANKING FACILITIES 
Since February 2006, the Group’s funding was principally by way of committed loan and overdraft through a five-year credit 
agreement with National Westminster Bank Plc, which was due for maturity in February 2011. In December 2010, the 
Group changed its funding to a three-year asset-based lending agreement with GE Commercial Finance Limited. 
Under the new asset-based lending agreement, the Group’s UK-based subsidiary undertakings can borrow funds based 
on the value of unpaid sales invoices and stock held in their UK warehouses. Amounts borrowed are secured by way of 
a cross guarantee and debenture over the assets of the Group companies based in the UK. Unlike the previous credit 
agreement, which provided a fixed and constant borrowing capacity, the new funding is variable depending upon the value 
of the assets on which it is based. The maximum borrowing capacity is, however, capped at £10 million for unpaid sales 
invoices and £6 million in regard to stock.  
As a consequence of the economic conditions leading to the significant fall in Armour Home’s sales, coupled with the costs 
of restructuring incurred during the year, the Group entered into a £1.2 million loan from Hawk Investment Holdings 
Limited to assist with working capital requirements. The loan is a related party transaction details of which are disclosed in 
Note 27 of the Consolidated Financial Statements.  
In September 2011, the Group changed its day-to-day UK banking arrangements from National Westminster Bank Plc to 
Lloyds TSB Bank plc. 
CASH FLOW AND NET DEBT 
The Group’s Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows is on page 37. 
The Group’s cash outflow from operations was £1.3 million (31 August 2010: £1.8 million inflow). Previous taxation 
payments were recovered during the year resulting in an overall tax inflow of £0.1 million (31 August 2010: £0.2 million 
outflow).  
Expenditure on investing activities reduced to £1.4 million (31 August 2010: £2.0 million). £0.4 million (31 August 2010: £0.4 
million) was spent on property, plant and equipment and £1.1 million (31 August 2010: 1.7 million) on intangible assets. 
The cash inflow in regard to financing activities was £7.6 million (31 August 2010: £1.4 million outflow). An inflow of £1.9 
million (31 August 2010: Nil) was in regard to the placing of shares during the year, a net inflow of £6.1 million (31 August 
2010: £1.0 million outflow) related to the refinancing undertaken during the year and the movements on loans. Interest 
payments were £0.4 million (31 August 2010: £0.2 million). The prior year comparative figures record the payment of £0.2 
million of dividend relating to the year ended 31 August 2009 and approved by shareholders at the Annual General Meeting 
held on 28 January 2010.  
Net debt is defined in Note 30 on page 63 of the Consolidated Financial Statements and at 31 August 2011 was £6.9 million 
(31 August 2010: £5.7 million).The Group’s borrowings are shown in Note 21 on page 57 of the Consolidated Financial 
Statements and, at 31 August 2011, the Group had undrawn facilities of £0.8 million (31 August 2010: £3.3 million). 
PRINCIPAL RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES 
Risk is an inherent part of doing business. The Board’s approach to risk management is balanced with encouragement of 
entrepreneurial flair and recognition that some necessary activities carry an inherent risk over which the Group may at 
best have only limited control. The Corporate Governance Statement on pages 25 to 28 describes the systems and 
processes through which the Directors manage, and aim to mitigate, risk. The Board considers that the principal 
commercial and financial risks are identified below. However, the Board also recognises that the nature and scope of risks 
can change particularly in a period of economic uncertainty.  Armour Group plc

BUSINESS REVIEW
FINANCE DIRECTOR’S REPORT

BUSINESS MODEL 
Our business strategy is based on five elements, being to:  
• Own and develop strong brands highly regarded in their markets; 
• Offer a quality product portfolio to our customers;  
• Continually improve our products through a structured programme of product development and innovation; 
• Maintain and grow our distribution platform; and  
• Offer our customers a first class service. 
Pursuit of this business strategy introduces new risks to the Group through, for example, the adoption of new technologies 
and interaction with new customers and territories. Conversely, the strategy allows the Group to diversify its interests and 
areas of expertise. At a strategic level, this is considered to increase resilience and reduce overall risk by avoiding reliance 
on a single brand, restricted product portfolios or confined business areas. This has particular relevance in periods of 
sharp economic downturn, customer uncertainty and depressed market conditions and in the current year has been seen 
in Armour Automotive’s year-on-year improvement by continued development of its non-retail sales channels . 
ECONOMIC AND MARKET CONDITIONS 
The UK’s economy has been in a period of depression and uncertainty since mid 2008, which is generally accepted to also 
be reflected by a worldwide slowdown. At the outset, a period of two years was considered a reasonable timeframe to 
stage recovery, but this has not proved to be the case. Since the general election in 2010, and the austerity programme 
subsequently implemented, UK market conditions and particularly consumer confidence has further declined causing 
progressive downgrades of the UK’s economic indicators over the course of the year. Other territories, most recently and 
particularly Europe, are experiencing difficulties implementing the necessary remedial measures given the effects these 
have on their populations. 
As reported in previous Annual Reports, whilst various national strategies have been deployed, it still remains unclear as to 
their effectiveness, the timeframe of continued depression and uncertainty, the degree of market volatility yet to be 
experienced and the speed of any sustained economic recovery.  
Consumer confidence and spending is of particular relevance to the markets in which the Group operates. Many factors, 
which include job security and levels of employment, cost inflation, availability of credit, interest rates and taxation all 
influence consumer behaviour and the general economic climate. In such times of economic uncertainty future predictions 
of market conditions, trends and performance are difficult. Nonetheless, as best as practicably possible, the Group takes 
into account external opinions in regard to the economic outlook and the potential effects on the Group’s markets.   
COMPETITION 
Armour Home and Armour Automotive operate in highly competitive markets and have to respond to market behaviour 
such as price deflation caused by advances in technology or aggressive pricing by competitors, possibly itself prompted by 
an unfavourable economic environment. 
Both divisions have established strong market positions by building recognised brands, adopting new technologies and 
having the necessary infrastructure to meet customer needs. These positions are maintained through measures that 
include continued expenditure on research and development and facilities. 
CHANGING CONSUMER DEMANDS 
The Group’s products are targeted at the consumer either through our retail customers or by being part of a larger 
product offering such as homes or vehicles. Consequently, the Group must respond to changing consumer demands that 
may be a response to aesthetic appeal, functionality or technological advancement. 
The Group addresses this risk by reviewing its product lines and regularly introducing enhanced and refreshed 
generations, many of which win awards. In addition, the Group’s Concept Design Centre focuses on emerging technologies 
and future product development strategies for the Group’s core product categories.   Armour Group plc 
ANNUAL REPORT 2011

Business Review Governance Financial Statements Annual General Meeting

FOREIGN MANUFACTURERS 
A significant proportion of the Group’s products are sourced from outside the United Kingdom. Consequently, the Group is 
subject to associated risks, which include foreign exchange rate fluctuations, inflation in foreign countries and duties 
imposed on foreign goods. In addition, legal standards, which are a requirement of the designated market of sale, but not 
the country of manufacture, must be complied with. 
The Group addresses this risk through Armour Asia, which based in Hong Kong liaises directly with the Group’s Far 
Eastern suppliers. This operation contains management with significant experience of the Group’s activities and 
requirements and also local nationals with an understanding of local culture and practices. 
In addition, both Armour Home and Armour Automotive retain UK-based assembly capability. This enables rapid response 
to customer demands, adaptability to short production runs and initial production of new products to identify errors and 
difficulties that may be encountered prior to offshore manufacture.  
RAW MATERIAL PRICES 
Many of the Group’s products contain copper (or other metals) and plastics whose prices can fluctuate either directly or by 
virtue of being a derivative product. The Group manages this risk by seeking long-term relationships with its development 
partners and suppliers, assessing lower cost design and, subject to other factors including market conditions, reflecting 
underlying cost increases in sales pricing. 
SENIOR MANAGEMENT 
As with many other organisations, the Group is dependent upon the hard work, dedication and experience of its 
management and staff. This is particularly true during challenging economic conditions. The Board and senior 
management supervise and monitor all aspects of the Group’s operations in the context of the business strategy and the 
execution of remedial measures taken in response to market conditions. Retention of senior management is desired so 
that experience is maintained and short-term measures are implemented with the least disruption possible, all in the 
context of maintaining the Group’s business model and objectives. 
The Remuneration Report on pages 29 to 31 details the procedures in place to attract, motivate and retain high calibre 
senior management personnel.  
INTERNAL CONTROLS 
The Group has a system of internal controls, which are included within the Corporate Governance Statement on page 27 as 
part of the Group’s consideration and application of Corporate Governance as a whole. The Group continues to review its 
internal controls but recognises that any such procedures can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance. 
TREASURY MANAGEMENT AND BANKING ARRANGEMENTS 
The Group’s treasury function is controlled centrally with the objective of securing funding availability and flexibility to meet 
the Group’s ongoing requirements. Foreign exchange exposures are generally managed directly by the operating 
subsidiary undertakings within the guidelines and controls established by the Directors. 
The Group maintains a continuing regular dialogue with its funders in regard to the Group’s performance and use 
of facilities. 
OTHER FINANCIAL RISKS 
Details of credit risk, interest rate risk, currency risk, liquidity risk and capital management are given in Note 3 of the 
Consolidated Financial Statements on pages 44 to 47. 
PERFORMANCE INDICATORS 
The Group measures its performance through a number of performance indicators. The Group sales, EBITDA and basic 
underlying earnings per ordinary share performance indicators used by the Group are shown below where in each case 
the figures have, as applicable, been adjusted to show continuing operations only.  Armour Group plc

EBITDA 
EBITDA is defined as the (loss)/earnings before interest, taxation, depreciation, amortisation (of both goodwill and other 
intangible assets) and share-based payments. It provides a useful indicator of both profitability and cash generation. In the

CORPORATE GOVERNANCE  
The Financial Reporting Council has issued the UK Corporate Governance Code, for adoption in accounting periods 
starting after 29 June 2010. The Company has, as far as practical, voluntarily complied with this code and a review of the 
Company’s application of its principles and provisions is given in the Corporate Governance Statement on pages 25 to 28. 
This also includes the Statement of Directors’ Responsibilities in preparing the Annual Report and financial statements on 
pages 27 and 28. The Corporate Governance Statement forms part of this Directors’ Report. 
DISCLOSURE OF INFORMATION TO AUDITORS 
As far as the Directors are aware, there is no relevant audit information (that is, information needed by the Group’s 
Auditors in connection with preparing their Report) of which the Group’s Auditors are unaware, and each Director has 
taken all reasonable steps that he ought to have taken as a Director in order to make himself aware of any relevant audit 
information and to establish that the Group’s Auditors are aware of that information.  
DONATIONS  
During the year, the Group made no charitable donations (31 August 2010: £932). No political donations were made in 
either the current or preceding year.  
FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS  
The financial risk management objectives of the Group including credit risk, interest rate risk and currency risk are 
provided in Note 3 of the Consolidated Financial Statements on pages 44 to 47. 
CREDITOR PAYMENT POLICY  
The Group does not follow any formal code or standard on payment practice. However, its policy is for subsidiary 
undertakings to agree terms and conditions for their business transactions with suppliers. Payment is normally made on 
these terms, subject to the terms and conditions being met by the suppliers. The Company had no trade creditors at the 
year end. The number of trade creditor days of the Group outstanding at the year end was 51 (31 August 2010: 61) days.  
RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT  
The Company and its subsidiary undertakings are committed to ongoing research and development to meet the changing 
needs of the markets that they serve. Research and development expenditure totalled £1.6 million for the year of which 
£0.6 million was expensed to the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income and £1.0 million was capitalised as 
intangible assets.  
EMPLOYEES  
The Group’s policy is to encourage effective communication and consultation between employees and management. 
Subsidiary undertakings develop their own consultative and communication procedures as part of their operating 
practices.  
The Company and its subsidiary undertakings give full consideration to applications for employment made by disabled 
people, having regard to their aptitudes and abilities. Should employees become disabled during their employment, they 
are considered for any necessary retraining and available work within their capabilities. For the purposes of training, 
career development and promotion, disabled employees are treated in the same way as other employees.  Business Review Governance Financial Statements Annual General Meeting

ENVIRONMENTAL POLICY  
The Group consults professional experts on environmental matters as part of pre-acquisition enquiries for new businesses 
and takes appropriate action on the advice received. The Group is committed to maintaining a responsible attitude to 
environmental management in all areas of its business.  
SHARE CAPITAL STRUCTURE  
At a general meeting held on 23 February 2011, it was resolved to reorganise the Company’s share capital and to amend 
the Company’s Articles accordingly. Each of the then existing issued 10p ordinary shares was split into one new ordinary 
share of 1p each and one deferred share of 9p each. Each of the authorised but unissued 10p ordinary shares was 
subdivided into 10 new ordinary shares of 1p each. On the same date, the Company issued 28,571,429 new ordinary shares 
of 1p each by way of a placing at 7p per share. 
At 31 August 2011, the Company’s authorised share capital was £15,000,000 divided into 883,679,397 ordinary shares 
of 1p each and 68,480,067 deferred shares of 9p each.  
At 31 August 2011, the Company’s issued share capital was £7,133,721 divided into 97,051,496 ordinary shares of 1p each 
and 68,480,067 deferred shares of 9p each. 
Save for shares held by the Armour Employees’ Share Trust, holders of ordinary shares are entitled to one vote per share 
at the meetings of the Company. The holders of the deferred shares have restricted rights including no entitlement to 
receive any dividend or other distribution nor to receive notice or speak or vote at general meetings of the Company.  
Further details of the Company’s share capital is given in Note 24 of the Consolidated Financial Statements. 
ARMOUR EMPLOYEES’ SHARE TRUST  
The Armour Employees’ Share Trust is a discretionary settlement, controlled and managed by an independent trustee 
company. It is empowered to purchase the Company’s ordinary shares (up to a maximum of 5% of the issued ordinary 
share capital) and subsequently make them available to employees, principally through the grant and exercise of rights 
under certain share option schemes operated by the Company. At 31 August 2011, the Armour Employees’ Share Trust 
held 3,424,000 ordinary shares but these have not been allocated to any specific beneficiaries under any scheme. The 
trustee is required to waive both voting rights and dividends payable on any ordinary share in the Company in excess 
of 0.001p, unless otherwise directed by the Company. 
SUBSTANTIAL INTERESTS  
The Company has been notified that, as at 5 December 2011, the following shareholders are interested in 3% or more of 
the ordinary shares in issue:

GOING CONCERN  
After making enquiries, the Directors have a reasonable expectation that the Group has adequate resources to continue 
in operational existence for the foreseeable future. For this reason, they continue to adopt the going concern basis in 
preparing the financial statements. 
AUDITORS  
BDO LLP has expressed its willingness to continue in office as Auditors and a resolution to reappoint them will 
be proposed at the forthcoming AGM.

CORPORATE GOVERNANCE STATEMENT 
25
The Company is committed to good standards of corporate governance. The Financial Reporting Council has issued the 
UK Corporate Governance Code (the “Code”) for adoption by fully listed companies for accounting periods starting on 
or after 29 June 2010. This Code superseded previous requirements. Although the Company is listed on the Alternative 
Investment Market, and therefore not required to comply with the Code, it has, as far as practical, voluntarily complied 
with its guidelines. This statement outlines how the Company has applied the relevant provisions of the Code.  
THE BOARD 
The Board comprises two non-executive Directors and two executive Directors. Bob Morton is the non-executive Chairman 
and Steve Bodger is the non-executive Senior Independent Director. The position of Chief Executive is separate from that of 
Chairman and is held by George Dexter. Biographical details of all Board members are shown on page 20. 
The Board is the link in the chain of authority between the shareholders and the executive management and, as such, 
plays a key role in the corporate governance process. It recognises the dual role played by the executive Directors as both 
members of the Board and leaders of the executive management team. This duality is addressed by the non-executive 
Directors through their positions of authority on the Board and through the Board committees that they manage. 
The Board believes that restricting its membership to four is appropriate, given the Group’s size, and enables collective 
decisions to be made without undue delay. However, the Board recognises that its capacity is limited and, consequently, 
reserves to itself the making of strategic (including budget approval) and broad policy decisions. Day-to-day decisions 
and policies are delegated to the executive Directors. The Board monitors progress on strategy and policy either through 
its committees or directly through the executive Directors. 
A formal schedule of matters is reserved for consideration at Board meetings, which is updated as and when new 
situations require. Key activities of the business are reviewed and the Board receives full supporting papers to enable it to 
do so effectively. The Company Secretary is responsible to the Board and is available to individual Directors in respect of 
Board procedures. Directors may take independent professional advice on any matter relating to the Company at the 
Company’s expense. 
The Board met thirteen times during the year. Bob Morton, George Dexter and John Harris were present at all meetings 
and Steve Bodger was present at ten meetings. For those meetings at which Directors may be absent, all Directors are 
nonetheless briefed on the matters arising so that their opinions can be taken into account. 
BOARD INDEPENDENCE 
In selecting Directors, the Company looks for individuals who provide business experience, strong personal skills and 
independence of thought and perspective. The non-executive Directors regularly visit the operations and have a sound 
understanding of the Group’s businesses and affairs, enabling them to properly evaluate information and responses 
provided by management. They provide an objective challenge to management by being prepared to question assumptions 
and air alternative views as necessary for the good of the businesses and Group as a whole. 
The Code sets out circumstances that may be relevant to the Board’s determination of whether a non-executive Director 
is independent. Bob Morton has declared to the Board his beneficial and non-beneficial interests in the Company’s 
shares and these interests are taken into account at all meetings of the Board and any decisions made by the Board 
as appropriate. 
The Board believes the non-executive Directors’ experience and knowledge of the Group’s businesses, combined with 
their external business experience, enable them to provide both an effective challenge and a constructive contribution 
to the Board. 
BOARD COMMITTEES 
The terms of reference for the Nominations, Remuneration and Audit Committees have been approved by the Board 
and are on the Group’s website www.armourgroup.uk.com. 
THE NOMINATIONS COMMITTEE 
The Nominations Committee meets as and when required to consider candidates for appointment as Directors. 
All Directors are required to submit themselves for re-election on the third anniversary of their last appointment. 
All of the Directors are members of the Nominations Committee of which Steve Bodger is the Chairman. 
The Nominations Committee did not meet during the year as the membership of the Board was both functional and stable.

THE REMUNERATION COMMITTEE 
The Remuneration Committee is responsible for ensuring that the remuneration packages of the executive Directors and 
senior managers are appropriate to attract, motivate and retain high calibre individuals. The Remuneration Report on 
pages 29 to 31 contains more detailed information on the Directors’ remuneration. The members of the Remuneration 
Committee are the two non-executive Directors, Steve Bodger, who is the Chairman, and Bob Morton. 
The Remuneration Committee met three times during the year and both members were present. 
THE AUDIT COMMITTEE 
The Audit Committee monitors the effectiveness of the internal controls and reviews the interim and annual financial 
statements before submission to the Board. It also advises the Board on the appointment of Auditors, reviews their fees 
and discusses the nature, scope and results of the audit with the Auditors. 
The members of the Audit Committee are the two non-executive Directors, Steve Bodger, who is the Chairman, 
and Bob Morton. 
The Audit Committee met seven times during the year and both members were present on each occasion. The executive 
Directors were invited to attend these meetings. The Company’s Auditors may also be invited to attend meetings, 
particularly to discuss the results of the annual audit, and are available to the Audit Committee throughout the year 
as and when required. 
The Audit Committee monitors the objectivity and independence of the Company’s Auditors. Generally, the Auditors’  
non-audit services are restricted to taxation advice and compliance. Any proposed additional work is considered on an 
individual basis. 
PERFORMANCE AND EVALUATION 
The performance of the Board and its Committees has been evaluated during the year in light of the size of the Group and 
resources available. The conclusions of this review were that: 
• There was the potential to increase the number of non-executive Directors, but that this was not necessary given the size 
of the Group; 
• The number of Board meetings and information presented at those meetings allowed continual monitoring of progress 
and informed decision making throughout the year; and 
• The Committees operated satisfactorily throughout the year and were able to attend to Group issues in a timely manner. 
RELATIONS WITH SHAREHOLDERS 
The Company maintains communication with institutional shareholders through individual meetings with senior 
management and through reports published by the Company’s stockbrokers. Private shareholders are encouraged to 
attend the Annual General Meeting at which the Company’s activities are considered and questions answered. General 
information about the Company and its businesses is also available on the Company’s website: www.armourgroup.uk.com. 
COMPLIANCE WITH THE CODE 
Throughout the year ended 31 August 2011, the Company has been in compliance with the provisions set out in the 
Code except for: 
• B.2.3 Non-executive appointments are not restricted to specified terms other than by the requirement for re-election 
every three years. 
• B.7.1 Non-executive Directors who have served longer than nine years are not subsequently automatically required to be 
re-elected on an annual basis. The Company considers that the benefit conferred by continuity of service, coupled with 
the existing requirement for re-election every three years and the terms of non-executive Directors’ service contracts to 
be appropriate. 
• C.3.1 The Code recommends that the Audit Committee comprise (excluding the Chairman) entirely independent  
non-executive Directors and that, given the Company’s size, there should be at least two. The Group’s Audit Committee 
comprises two non-executive Directors, one of whom is the Company’s Chairman. 
• D.2.1 The Code recommends that the Remuneration Committee comprise at least two independent non-executive 
Directors. The Group’s Remuneration Committee comprises two non-executive Directors, one of whom is the 
Company’s Chairman.  Business Review Governance Financial Statements Annual General Meeting

INTERNAL CONTROLS 
The Board has overall responsibility for the Group’s system of internal control. It should be recognised that any such 
system of internal control can provide only reasonable, but not absolute, assurance against material misstatement or loss. 
The Board confirms that it has carried out a review of the effectiveness of the Group’s internal controls as operated during 
the year. 
Processes to assess and manage the risks to success faced by the businesses are reviewed and improved as necessary. 
The objective is to enable the businesses to achieve their objectives without being hindered by circumstances that could 
have been reasonably foreseen whilst, at the same time, not adversely constricting the businesses with unnecessary 
bureaucracy. The principal elements of the system, which are designed to recognise the specific requirements of the 
Group, include: 
• An organisational structure with defined levels of responsibility and delegation of authority, which is subject to the overall 
Group control procedures; 
• Review of the risks faced by the businesses; 
• Comprehensive budgeting system producing detailed profit and loss account, balance sheet and cash flows, which are 
approved by the Board; 
• Monthly reporting of results that are compared to budget and revised forecasts; 
• Regular meetings with the Managing Directors of the Group’s operating divisions to review the current and forecast 
performance of each business; 
• Central control over key areas such as capital expenditure authorisation, insurance and banking facilities; and 
• Annual completion by the operating divisions of a self-certification internal control questionnaire, which confirms that 
appropriate controls are in place. Where potential weaknesses are identified, appropriate action is taken. 
The Group continues to review its system of internal control to ensure compliance with best practice, whilst also having 
regard to its size and the resources available. In this context, the Board has concluded that the introduction of an internal 
audit function is not appropriate at this juncture. 
STATEMENT OF DIRECTORS’ RESPONSIBILITIES 
The Directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report and the financial statements in accordance with applicable 
law and regulations. 
Company law requires the Directors to prepare financial statements for each financial year. Under that law the Directors 
have elected to prepare the Group’s Consolidated Financial Statements in accordance with International Financial 
Reporting Standards (“IFRS”) as adopted by the European Union, and the Company Financial Statements in accordance 
with United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice (United Kingdom Accounting Standards and applicable law). 
Under company law the Directors must not approve the financial statements unless they are satisfied that they give a true 
and fair view of the state of affairs of the Group and Company and of the profit or loss of the Group for that period. The 
Directors are also required to prepare financial statements in accordance with the rules of the London Stock Exchange for 
companies trading securities on the Alternative Investment Market. 
In preparing these financial statements, the Directors are required to: 
• Select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently; 
• Make judgements and accounting estimates that are reasonable and prudent; 
• State whether they have been prepared in accordance with applicable accounting standards, subject to any material 
departures disclosed and explained in the financial statements; and 
• Prepare the financial statements on a going concern basis unless it is inappropriate to presume that the Company will 
continue in business.

The Directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting records that are sufficient to show and explain the 
Company’s transactions and disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position of the Company and 
enable them to ensure that the financial statements comply with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006. They are 
also responsible for safeguarding the assets of the Company and hence for taking reasonable steps for the prevention and 
detection of fraud and other irregularities. 
WEBSITE PUBLICATION 
The Directors are responsible for ensuring the Directors’ Report and financial statements are made available on a website. 
Financial statements are published on the Company’s website in accordance with legislation in the United Kingdom 
governing the preparation and dissemination of financial statements, which may vary from legislation in other jurisdictions. 
The maintenance and integrity of the Company’s website is the responsibility of the Directors. The Directors’ responsibility 
also extends to the ongoing integrity of the financial statements contained therein.

REMUNERATION REPORT

SCOPE OF REPORT 
The Remuneration Report sets out the Company’s remuneration policy and, particularly, its approach for Directors. It also 
explains how the Company applies the principles of good corporate governance in relation to remuneration. This Report 
has been prepared by the Remuneration Committee and has been approved by the Board. 
COMPOSITION AND ROLE 
The Remuneration Committee’s members are Steve Bodger, who is the Chairman, and Bob Morton. The Committee 
is responsible for reviewing all senior executive appointments and determining the Group’s policy in respect of the 
terms of employment, including remuneration packages of executive Directors and for monitoring senior management 
development programmes. The constitution and operation of the Committee are in compliance with the principles, 
which are incorporated in Schedule A of the UK Corporate Governance Code (the “Code”). The Committee has given 
full consideration to the best practice provisions set out in the Code in determining the remuneration packages for 
executive Directors. 
REMUNERATION POLICY 
The objective of the Group’s remuneration policy is to attract, motivate and retain high quality individuals who will 
contribute fully to the success of the Group. To achieve this objective, the Group provides competitive salaries and benefits 
to all employees. Packages are established having regard to current market practice. 
Executive Directors’ remuneration is set to create an appropriate balance between both fixed and performance-related 
elements. Performance-related elements are intended to comprise a significant part of potential remuneration. 
Remuneration is reviewed each year in light of the Group’s business objectives. It is the Remuneration Committee’s 
intention that remuneration should reward achievement of objectives and that these are aligned with shareholders’ 
interests over the medium term. 
Remuneration consists of the following elements: 
• Basic salary; 
• Performance-related annual bonus; 
• Benefits; 
• Defined contribution pension payments; and 
• Share options. 
BONUSES AND BENEFITS 
The executive Directors’ bonus scheme is linked to the Group’s year-on-year profit performance and working 
capital management. 
Divisional performance-related bonus schemes are in place so that bonuses may be payable to senior executives provided 
their divisional results reach pre-set profit and cash generation targets. 
Senior executives’ benefits typically, but not necessarily, include a car (or cash alternative) and insurance for life, disability 
and health care. 
SHARE OPTIONS 
The Company has a number of share option schemes, details of which are in Note 26 of the Consolidated Financial 
Statements. Under these schemes, share options have been granted to the executive Directors and senior executives 
within the Group. 
The grant of share options is a recognised mechanism, practiced by the Company, to encourage continual improvement 
and align the interests and objectives of the senior management team with those of shareholders over the medium term.  Armour Group plc 
ANNUAL REPORT 2011
GOVERNANCE
REMUNERATION REPORT  
CONTINUED 
30 
In its review of share options, the Remuneration Committee is mindful of recommended practice, which is taken into 
account with other factors that include: 
• The available headroom under the schemes for new grants; 
• The price of previously granted options and whether these continue to act as the intended incentive; and 
• Share price movements as compared to the Group’s performance. 
PENSION ARRANGEMENTS 
The majority of senior executives are members of a defined contribution pension plan operated by the Group or, 
alternatively, have their own personal pension arrangements to which the Group contributes between 7% and 11% 
of pensionable salary. 
EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS’ SERVICE CONTRACTS 
The executive Directors have service contracts with the Company, which are not of fixed duration and are terminable 
by either party giving twelve months’ written notice. 
NON-EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS 
There are service contracts with the Company for the provision of non-executive Directors’ services, which may be 
terminated by either party giving three months’ written notice. The fees payable for the services of the non-executive 
Directors are set by the Board. 
DIRECTORS’ REMUNERATION

The above figures represent remuneration earned as Directors during the relevant year. 
The executive Directors’ basic salaries have remained unchanged for the fourth consecutive year, and no bonuses have 
been awarded over that period. Benefits relate to the assessable taxation benefits arising from a company car allowance 
and insurance for life, disability and health care. The reduction in benefits in the current year reflects reduced 
insurance cost. 
The non-executive Directors have reduced their fees for the year ending 31 August 2011. 
Fees for Bob Morton’s services, inclusive of all expenses, are payable to Hawk Consulting Limited, a company in which 
he has an interest. 
Fees for Steve Bodger’s services are payable to Stratys Limited, a company in which he has an interest. 
The figures for pensions shown above are the contributions paid by the Company.

1 ACCOUNTING POLICIES  
Basis of preparation 
The Group’s Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting 
Standards, International Accounting Standards and Interpretations (collectively “IFRS”) issued by the International 
Accounting Standards Board as adopted by the European Union and with those parts of the Companies Act 2006 applicable 
to companies preparing their financial statements under IFRS. 
The principal accounting policies adopted in the preparation of the Group’s Consolidated Financial Statements are set out 
below. The policies have been consistently applied to all of the years presented, unless otherwise stated. 
Changes in accounting policies 
New standards, interpretations and amendments effective from 1 September 2010. 
The following new standards, interpretations and amendments effective for the first time from 1 September 2010, have not 
had a material effect on the financial statements: 
• IFRS 2 (Amendment): Group Cash-settled Share-based Payment Transactions (from 1 January 2010); 
• Improvements to IFRS (2010) (from 1 January 2010);  
• IAS 32 (Amendment): Classification of Rights Issues (from 1 February 2010); and 
• IFRIC 19: Extinguishing Financial Liabilities with Equity Instruments (from 1 July 2010). 
Basis of consolidation 
These Consolidated Financial Statements present the results of the Company and its subsidiary undertakings (“Group”) as 
if they form a single entity. Subsidiary undertakings are entities over which the Company has control in terms of the power 
to govern the financial and operating policies of an acquired entity so as to obtain benefits from its activities. Intercompany 
transactions and balances between entities within the Group are therefore eliminated in full. 
Business combinations 
These Consolidated Financial Statements incorporate the results of business combinations using the purchase method. In 
the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position, the acquired identified assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities are 
initially recognised at their fair values at the date of acquisition. The results of acquired operations are included in the 
Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income from the date on which control is obtained. 
Goodwill 
Goodwill arising on the acquisition of a business represents any excess of the fair value of the consideration over the fair 
value of the identifiable assets and liabilities acquired. The identifiable assets and liabilities acquired are incorporated into 
the Consolidated Financial Statements at their fair value to the Group. 
Goodwill is not amortised but tested for impairment annually. Any impairment is recognised immediately in the 
Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income and is not subsequently reversed. On disposal of a business, the 
attributable amount of goodwill is included in the determination of the profit or loss on disposal.  Business Review Governance Financial Statements Annual General Meeting

1 ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED 
Intangible assets (excluding goodwill) 
Intangible assets (excluding goodwill) include the following: 
(a) Development costs 
Both internal and external development costs, associated with the production of saleable products, are capitalised as an 
intangible asset in accordance with the criteria of IAS 38 which include that the asset created can be identified, the cost can 
be measured reliably and it is probable that the asset will generate future economic benefits. The asset is then amortised 
on a straight-line basis over the expected sales period for the product, on a product type by product type basis. This is 
normally between three and five years. 
Where no intangible asset can be identified, development costs are recognised as an expense in the financial period in 
which they are incurred. 
(b) Other intangible assets 
Other intangible assets include investments, recorded at cost, in software (which is separately identifiable from the 
hardware on which it runs) and acquired brands. The assets so created are amortised on a straight-line basis over their 
expected useful lives as follows: Software between three and five years and brands twenty years. 
Where the software is not separately identifiable from the hardware, it is included with the hardware in property, plant 
and equipment. 
Impairment of non-financial assets 
Impairment tests on goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite useful lives are undertaken annually for the 
reporting year end. Other non-financial assets are subject to impairment tests whenever events or changes in 
circumstances indicate that their carrying amount may not be recoverable. Where the carrying value of an asset is judged 
to exceed its recoverable amount (i.e. the higher of value in use or the fair value less costs to sell), the asset is written 
down accordingly. 
Where it is not possible to estimate the recoverable amount of an individual asset, the impairment test is carried out on the 
asset’s cash-generating unit (i.e. the lowest group of assets, in which the asset belongs, for which there are separately 
identifiable cash flows). Goodwill is allocated on initial recognition to each of the Group’s cash-generating units that are 
expected to benefit from the synergies of the combination giving rise to the goodwill. 
Impairment charges, and the reversal of previous impairment charges, are expensed/credited to the Consolidated 
Statement of Comprehensive Income. 
Property, plant and equipment 
Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost less the accumulated depreciation and, where appropriate, provision for 
impairment in value or estimated loss on disposal. Property, plant and equipment are depreciated over their estimated 
useful lives on a straight-line basis as follows: 
Leasehold improvements   over the term of the lease 
Plant and fixtures and fittings  10% – 33% 
Motor vehicles   20% – 25% 
Foreign currencies 
The results of overseas subsidiary undertakings are translated into sterling at the actual rates of exchange during the 
financial period and their balance sheets at the rates ruling at the financial period end. Gains or losses arising on the 
translation of the opening net assets and results of overseas subsidiary undertakings are recognised in Other 
Comprehensive Income and taken to the Group’s translation reserve. 
Transactions denominated in foreign currencies are translated into sterling at the exchange rate in operation on the date 
of the transaction. Monetary assets and liabilities originally denominated in foreign currencies are translated into sterling 
at the exchange rate in operation at the date of the financial period end. Exchange gains and losses are reported as part of 
the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income.  Armour Group plc

Financial instruments 
(a) Derivative financial instruments 
The Group uses foreign exchange forward contracts to hedge financial risks to changes in foreign currency exchange 
rates. These financial instruments are included in the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position as assets or liabilities 
at their fair values. The Group does not use derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes but its financial 
instruments do not qualify for hedge accounting under IFRS and consequently changes in their fair values are recognised 
in the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income as they arise.  
(b) Bank borrowings 
Bank borrowings are initially recognised at fair value. Such interest bearing liabilities are subsequently measured at 
amortised cost using the effective interest rate method, which ensures that any interest expense over the period to 
repayment is at a constant rate on the balance of the liability carried in the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position. 
The interest expense includes initial transaction costs and premiums payable on redemption, as well as any interest 
coupon payable while the liability is outstanding. 
(c) Trade receivables and trade payables 
Trade receivables and trade payables are non-derivative assets and liabilities of fixed or determinable amounts that are 
not quoted in an active market. They arise principally through the provision of goods and services to customers (trade 
debtors) or the purchase of goods and services (trade creditors and accruals). They are initially recognised at fair value and 
subsequently carried at amortised cost and in the case of trade receivables less any provision for impairment. 
Inventories 
Inventories have been valued at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Cost includes all direct expenditure to bring 
items to their condition and location at the accounting date, together with, in the case of goods manufactured by the Group, 
an appropriate proportion of production overhead expenditure attributable thereto. 
Cash and cash equivalents 
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash in hand, at bank and deposits where the amounts are not part of the Group’s 
set-off arrangements and, in the case of deposits, where they are repayable within three months and are subject to an 
insignificant risk of a change in value. Bank overdrafts are shown within current liabilities in the Consolidated Statement 
of Financial Position but are included within cash and cash equivalents in respect of the Consolidated Statement of 
Cash Flows. 
Provisions 
Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present obligation (legal or constructive) as a result of a past event, it is 
probable that an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation and a reliable 
estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation. The provision is recorded at the present value of the expenditures 
expected to be required to settle the obligation using a discount rate that reflects the current market assessment of the 
time value of money and the risks specific to the obligation. The increase in the provision due to the passage of time is 
recognised as a finance cost. 
Deferred taxation 
Deferred taxation is the taxation expected to be payable or recoverable on differences between the carrying amounts of 
assets and liabilities in the financial statements and the corresponding taxation bases used in the computation of taxable 
profit. It is accounted for using the balance sheet liability method. Deferred taxation liabilities are generally recognised for 
all taxable temporary differences except goodwill. Deferred taxation assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable 
that taxable profit will be available against which deductible temporary differences can be utilised. 
Deferred taxation is calculated at the taxation rate that is expected to apply in the financial period when the liability is 
settled or the asset is realised.  Business Review Governance Financial Statements Annual General Meeting

1 ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED 
Leases 
Where substantially all of the risks and rewards incidental to ownership of a leased asset have been transferred to the 
Group (a “finance lease”), the asset is treated as if it had been purchased outright. The amount initially recognised as an 
asset is the present value of the minimum lease payments payable over the term of the lease. The corresponding lease 
commitment is shown as a liability. Lease payments are analysed between capital and interest. The interest element is 
charged to the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income over the period of the lease and is calculated so that it 
represents a constant proportion of the lease liability. The capital element reduces the balance owed to the lessor. 
Where substantially all of the risks and rewards incidental to ownership are retained by the lessor (an “operating lease”), 
the total rental payable under the lease is charged to the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income on a straight-
line basis over the lease term. 
Revenue 
Revenue represents the invoiced value of goods sold and the value of services provided to third party customers, excluding 
value added tax. Revenue is recognised when the risks and rewards of owning the goods have passed to the customer, 
which is generally on delivery or when services have been provided. 
Share-based payments 
Where share options are awarded to employees, the fair value of the option at the date of grant is charged to the 
Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income over the vesting period. Non-market vesting conditions are taken into 
account by adjusting the number of equity instruments expected to vest at each balance sheet date so that, ultimately, the 
cumulative amount recognised over the vesting period is based on the number of options that eventually vest. Market 
vesting conditions are factored into the fair value of the options granted. As long as all other vesting conditions are 
satisfied, a charge is made irrespective of whether the market vesting conditions are satisfied. The cumulative expense is 
not adjusted for failure to achieve a market vesting condition. 
Where share options are cancelled, their remaining unamortised fair value is fully written off through the Consolidated 
Statement of Comprehensive Income. 
Pension costs 
The Group operates defined contribution arrangements. The pension costs payable by the Group in the financial period are 
charged to the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income. 
Dividends 
Equity dividends are recognised when they become legally payable, which is when they are approved by the shareholders 
at the Annual General Meeting. They are charged directly to equity. 
Armour Employees’ Share Trust 
As the Company is deemed to have control of the Armour Employees’ Share Trust, it is treated as a subsidiary 
undertaking. The assets (other than investments in the Company’s ordinary shares), liabilities, income and expenses are 
included on a line-by-line basis in the Consolidated Financial Statements. The investment in the Company’s ordinary 
shares is shown in the share trust reserve and is treated as a deduction from equity in the Consolidated Statement of 
Financial Position.  Armour Group plc

Standards, amendments and interpretations to existing standards not yet effective 
The following standard has been published but is not effective for the periods presented, has not been endorsed by the 
European Union and the Group has chosen not to early adopt: 
IFRS 9: Financial Instruments (effective for accounting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2013). It is envisaged that 
this standard will replace IAS 39: Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement in its entirety. The Group is 
currently assessing the impact of the new standard on its Consolidated Financial Statements. 
At the date of authorisation of these financial statements, the following standards, amendments or revisions to standards 
and interpretations of existing standards were in issue, but were not yet effective and/or had not been endorsed by the 
European Union. They have not been applied to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 
Applicable to the Group from 1 September 2011: 
• IFRS 7 (Amendment): Disclosures – Transfers of Financial Assets (from 1 July 2011); 
• IFRS 1 (Amendment): Severe hyperinflation and removal of fixed dates for first-time adopters (from 1 July 2011). 
Applicable to the Group subsequent to 31 August 2012: 
• IAS 12 (Amendment): Deferred Tax – Recovery of underlying assets (from 1 January 2012); 
• IAS 1 (Amendment): Presentation of items of Other Comprehensive Income (from 1 July 2012);

2 ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES AND JUDGEMENTS 
(a) Impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets 
The Group is required to test on an annual basis, whether goodwill has suffered any impairment. Other intangible assets 
are tested for impairment when indication of impairment exists. The recoverable amount is determined based on value in 
use calculations. The use of this method requires the estimation of future cash flows and the choice of a discount rate in 
order to calculate the present value of the cash flows. Actual outcomes may vary. More information on goodwill 
impairment testing including the carrying value is included in Note 13. 
(b) Useful lives of intangible assets and property, plant and equipment 
Intangible assets and property, plant and equipment are amortised or depreciated over their useful lives. Useful lives are 
based on the management’s estimates of the period that the assets will generate revenue, which are periodically reviewed 
for continued appropriateness. Changes to estimates can result in significant variations in the carrying value and amounts 
charged to the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income in specific periods. More details including the carrying 
values are included in Notes 14 and 15. 
(c) Fair value of financial instruments 
The Group determines the fair value of financial instruments that are not quoted using valuation techniques. Those 
techniques are significantly affected by the assumptions used, including discount rates and estimates of future cash flows. 
In that regard, the derived fair value estimates cannot always be substituted by comparison with independent markets and, 
in many cases, may not be capable of being realised immediately. 
More details on financial instruments are given in Note 3. 
(d) Inventories 
The companies within the Group that carry inventory review the net realisable value of, and demand for, their inventory on 
a regular basis and particularly at the year end to provide assurance that it is stated at the lower of cost and net realisable 
value. Factors that could impact estimated demand and selling prices include the timing and success of future 
technological innovations, competitor activities, supplier prices and economic trends. 
(e) Share-based payments 
The fair value of share option share-based payments is estimated, using the Black-Scholes valuation model, as at the date 
of grant and using certain assumptions. 
(f) Provisions 
The Group recognises provisions in accordance with its accounting policy described on page 40. In arriving at estimates for 
provisions, estimates and judgements are made, in particular with regard to timing and amount. Calculations are based on 
anticipated future cash flows relating to the relevant event, which are estimated by management and where appropriate 
supported by the use of external advisers. 
(g) Taxation 
The Group is subject to taxation in several jurisdictions and judgement is required in determining the provision for income 
and deferred taxation. The Group recognises taxation assets and liabilities based upon estimates and assessments of 
many factors including past experience, advice received on the relevant taxation legislation and judgements about the 
outcome of future events. To the extent that the final outcome of these matters is different from the amounts recorded, 
such differences will impact on the taxation charge made in the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income in the 
period in which such determination is made.  Armour Group plc

Valuation hierarchy 
The adoption of the amendment to IFRS 7 requires enhanced disclosures about fair value measurements of financial 
instruments through the use of a three-level fair value hierarchy that prioritises the valuation techniques used in fair value 
calculations. 
The levels can be broadly described as follows: 
• Level 1 – use of unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities;  
• Level 2 – use of observable inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1, such as quoted prices for similar 
assets or liabilities in active markets; and  
• Level 3 – use of inputs not based on observable market data but reflecting management’s own assumptions about 
pricing the asset or liability.   Business Review Governance Financial Statements Annual General Meeting

The Group encounters, through its operations, the following financial risks: 
• Credit risk; 
• Market risk, being; 
 (a) Interest rate risk; 
 (b) Currency risk; 
• Liquidity risk; 
• Capital management. 
In common with all other businesses, the Group encounters risks that arise from its use of financial instruments. This note 
describes the Group’s objectives, policies and processes for managing those risks and the methods used to measure 
them. Additional information in respect of these risks is included throughout the Consolidated Financial Statements. 
Credit risk 
Credit risk is the risk of financial loss to the Group if a customer or counterparty to a financial instrument fails to meet its 
contractual obligations. The Group is mainly exposed to credit risk from credit sales. It is the Group’s policy, implemented 
in the operating subsidiary undertakings, to assess the credit worthiness of customers prior to opening new accounts. This 
assessment includes an internal assessment of the acceptable risk corroborated where available with an external rating 
from an acceptable credit rating agency. Purchase limits are established for customers, which represent the maximum 
open amount. Authorisation to allow sales that would cause this limit to be exceeded is required from the operating 
subsidiary undertaking senior management team. If this authorisation is not given, no further sales are made to that 
customer until payment has been received. 
Credit risk also arises from cash and cash equivalents and deposits with banks and financial institutions. The Group’s main 
day-to-day banking arrangements were transferred in September 2011 to Lloyds TSB Bank plc. Amounts held by overseas 
operations with foreign banks are kept to a minimum. 
The Group does not enter into derivatives to manage credit risk, although, in certain cases, may take steps to mitigate such 
risks if it is sufficiently concentrated. 
Quantitative disclosure of the credit risk exposure in relation to trade and other receivables is given in Note 18.  Armour Group plc

3 FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AND RISK MANAGEMENT CONTINUED 
Market risk 
Market risk arises from the Group’s interest bearing, tradable and foreign currency financial instruments. It is the risk that 
the fair value, or future cash flows, of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of changes in the interest rates (interest 
rate risk) or foreign exchange rates (currency risk). 
(a) Interest rate risk 
The Group is exposed to cash flow interest rate risk from its overdraft and loan facilities, which carry interest at variable 
rates. The Group’s policy is to balance exposure to interest rate risk with the cost and flexibility of funding. This policy is 
managed centrally and subsidiary undertakings are generally not permitted to borrow from external sources and not 
without central approval. 
The requirement for interest rate hedging is reviewed periodically being a mechanism available to manage interest rate 
risk. These reviews acknowledge that interest rate hedges will not necessarily protect the Group from the risk of paying 
rates in excess of current market rates nor eliminate cash flow risk associated with the variability in interest payments. 
Judgements are therefore exercised in the context of the market and the materiality of the potential risk compared to the 
cost. At 31 August 2011: none (31 August 2010: none) of the Group’s borrowings were hedged against interest rate 
movements. 
Based upon the average of the Group’s net debt during the year, it is estimated that a rise/fall of one percentage point in 
the principal interest rates to which the Group is exposed would decrease/increase profit before taxation by approximately 
£72,000 (31 August 2010: £73,000). 
(b) Currency risk 
Currency risk arises because the Group has operations located in various parts of the world whose functional currencies 
are different from that of the Group. However, these are not currently considered to be of a size that would warrant use of 
a hedge against the net investments in these overseas operations. 
Currency risk also arises when operating subsidiary undertakings enter into transactions denominated in a currency that 
is different from their functional currency. The principal exposure is through purchases made from suppliers in North 
America and the Far East which are denominated in US dollars. 
The Group’s policy is, where possible, to allow operating subsidiary undertakings to settle foreign currency transactions 
with cash generated in the same functional currency from their normal operations. If this is not possible, but cash in the 
required functional currency exists elsewhere in the Group, it will be transferred. Generally, however, purchases in foreign 
currency exceed receipts. Consequently, the Group will enter into forward currency contracts to protect against currency 
risk. Forward currency contracts typically crystallise on a monthly basis, account for up to half the projected forward 
monthly exposure and may be taken out up to twelve months forward. Judgement is exercised with respect to the 
appropriate time to enter into forward currency contracts and in the context of the overall funding facilities available 
to the Group. 
Although the Board accepts that this policy does not protect the Group entirely from currency risk or from incurring an 
exchange rate in the future that is adverse to the then spot rate in operation, it considers that it achieves an appropriate 
balance against exposure to the risk. 
Financial instruments within individual Group companies that are not denominated in the functional currency of the 
company concerned at 31 August 2011 were as follows:

3 FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AND RISK MANAGEMENT CONTINUED 
The Group’s major non-functional currency exposure is to the US dollar and Euro. It is estimated that the impact of a 10% 
strengthening of the US dollar and Euro would decrease profit before taxation by approximately £87,000 (31 August 2010: 
£160,000). A 10% weakening of the US dollar and Euro would increase profit before taxation by approximately £71,000 
(31 August 2010: £131,000). 
It should be noted that the sensitivity indication given above reflects the impact on financial instruments held at the 
financial reporting date. It does not reflect changes in revenue or costs that may result from changing exchange rates. 
Liquidity risk 
Liquidity risk arises from the Group’s management of working capital and the finance charges and principal repayments 
on its debt instruments. It is the risk that the Group will encounter difficulty in meeting its financial obligations as they 
fall due. 
The Group finances its operations through a mix of equity and borrowings. The Group’s objective is to provide funding for 
future growth and achieve a balance between continuity and flexibility through its borrowing arrangements. At the year end 
the Group was able to draw on funds based upon the value, within its UK trading subsidiary undertakings, of unpaid sales 
invoices and stock held in their UK warehouses. At 31 August 2011, the Group had undrawn facilities of £0.8 million (31 
August 2010: £3.3 million). Further details of the Group’s facilities, and changes thereto over the year, are given in the 
Finance Director’s Report on page 15 and in Note 21. 
If from time to time, the Group has surplus funds, interest income is earned on a daily basis. 
Capital management 
The Group manages its capital structure in order to safeguard the going concern of the Group and provide returns for 
shareholders and benefits for other stakeholders. The capital structure of the Group consists of debt, which includes 
borrowings disclosed in Note 21, cash and cash equivalents and equity attributable to equity holders of the Company, 
comprising issued capital, reserves and retained earnings. 
The Group may maintain or adjust its capital structure by adjusting the amount of dividend paid to shareholders, returning 
capital to shareholders, issuing new shares or selling assets to reduce debt.

5 EXCEPTIONAL ITEMS 
Over the course of the year and in response to the economic environment, the Group has implemented a restructuring 
programme, particularly within the Armour Home division. The restructuring involved redundancies and the closure of 
various UK operational activities, which in turn has necessitated the write-down of various assets held by the subsidiary 
undertakings. The exceptional costs incurred are shown below: 
 £000
Redundancy and agency termination costs 638
Amounts written-off tangible fixed assets 224
Amounts written-off intangible fixed assets 438
Property exit, relocation and other associated costs 142
Total exceptional items 1,442
6 DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS 
At the start of the year, in response to customer indicated demand, the Group set-up a Chinese manufacturing facility. 
Due to the subsequent curtailment of demand, continued operation of this facility which required a steady and reliable 
production volume, was no longer viable. Consequently, the facility was closed in May 2011. The costs of setting up and 
then terminating this now discontinued operation, and the associated tax credit, are shown below:

11 (LOSS)/EARNINGS PER ORDINARY SHARE 
Basic (loss)/earnings per ordinary share are calculated using the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue 
during the financial year of 79,850,588 (31 August 2010: 65,056,067). Diluted (loss)/earnings per ordinary share are 
calculated with reference to 79,850,588 (31 August 2010: 65,056,067) ordinary shares. The effect of the exercise of options 
on the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue is nil (31 August 2010: Nil). 
At the Company’s general meeting held on 23 February 2011, the share capital was reorganised which gave rise to the 
creation of deferred shares (Note 24). These deferred shares have restricted and minimal rights whereby holders are not 
entitled to receive any dividend or other distribution. The deferred shares are therefore excluded from the weighted 
average, and the diluted weighted average, ordinary shares in issue during the financial year. 
At 31 August 2011, the Armour Employees’ Share Trust held 3,424,000 (31 August 2010: 3,424,000) ordinary shares. 
The weighted average number of ordinary shares held by the Armour Employees’ Share Trust during the year of 3,424,000 
(31 August 2010: 3,424,000) is not included in either the weighted average, or diluted weighted average, ordinary shares in 
issue during the financial year.  Business Review Governance Financial Statements Annual General Meeting

Underlying (loss)/earnings per ordinary share are also shown calculated by reference to earnings before exceptional 
items, discontinued operations and share-based payments. The Directors consider that this gives a useful additional 
indication of underlying performance. It should be noted that the term “underlying” is not defined under IFRS and may not 
therefore be comparable with similarly titled profit measures reported by other entities.

Goodwill acquired in business combinations and carried in the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position is allocated to 
the cash-generating units (“CGUs”) that are expected to benefit from that business combination. The carrying amount of 
goodwill has been allocated as follows: 
 
31 August

Armour Automotive 2,088 2,088
Armour Home  18,996 18,996
At the end of the year  21,084 21,084
The recoverable amounts of the CGUs are determined from value in use calculations. The key assumptions for the value in 
use calculations are those regarding discount rates, growth rates, expected sales prices and costs during the period. 
Management estimates discount rates that reflect current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks 
specific to the CGUs. The growth rates, selling prices and direct costs are based on past experience and expectations of 
future changes in the market. 
The Group prepares cash flow forecasts derived from the most recent financial budgets approved by management and 
extrapolates cash flows for the following years based upon estimated growth rates. 
The extrapolated cash flows have been prepared for 10 years with an average growth rate of 3% (31 August 2010: 3%). The 
pre-taxation rate used to discount the cash flows was 10% (31 August 2010: 15%).  Armour Group plc

The Group’s previous principal funding arrangements with National Westminster Bank Plc were in the form of loan and 
overdraft, the bulk of which were subject to maturity in February 2011. In December 2010, the Group changed its funding to 
a three year asset-based lending agreement with GE Commercial Finance Limited, under which the Group’s subsidiary 
undertakings can borrow funds based on the value of unpaid sales invoices (capped at £10 million) and stock held in their 
UK warehouses (capped at £6 million). Amounts borrowed are secured by way of a cross guarantee and debenture over 
the assets of the Group companies based in the UK. 
Amounts borrowed are subject to a floating rate of interest being three month LIBOR plus margin. At 31 August 2011 the 
interest rate applicable to the amount borrowed was 2.9% (31 August 2010: 1.75%).  
In July 2011 the Group entered into a £1.2 million loan from Hawk Investment Holdings Limited. This loan is for a period of 
364 days, carries interest at 1% per month and can be repaid at any time at the request of the Company with no early 
redemption cost. The loan is secured by a debenture that ranks behind that held by GE Commercial Finance Limited. 
The maturity of non-current borrowing is as follows:

2011
£000

2010

Between one and two years  – 516
Between two and five years  – –

Although the current agreement is for a period of three years to December 2013, each amount borrowed under the asset 
based lending arrangement is considered repayable within one year and will be replaced with new borrowings on an on-
going basis. The prior year figures are based on the previous term loan arrangements and show the contractual 
undiscounted cash flow including an estimate that the interest rate then ruling of 1.75% would persist to maturity.    Armour Group plc

25 RESERVES 
The nature of the reserves shown in the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position and Consolidated Statement of 
Changes in Shareholders’ Equity is as follows: 
Share premium  Amount subscribed for share capital in excess of nominal value. 
Other reserves  The premium on shares issued as consideration shares for acquisitions, being the difference between 
the nominal value and fair value of these shares. In accordance with Sections 612 and 615 of the 
Companies Act 2006, the acquiring company has taken no account of this premium and the cost of 
investment includes only the nominal value of the consideration shares. On consolidation, the 
premium has been credited to this reserve. 
Retained earnings  Cumulative net gains and losses recognised in the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive 
Income. 
Translation reserve  Gains and losses arising on retranslating the net assets of overseas operations into sterling. 
Share trust reserve  Cost of Company’s shares held by the Armour Employees’ Share Trust.

• 1999 Unapproved Executive Share Option Scheme; 
• 1999 Approved Executive Share Option Scheme; and 
• Enterprise Management Incentive Share Option Plan. 
Options granted under the 1999 Unapproved Executive Share Option Scheme, 1999 Approved Executive Share Option

1 BASIS OF PREPARATION 
The Company Financial Statements have been prepared on the basis of accounting policies set out in Note 2 below using 
applicable accounting standards generally accepted in the United Kingdom (UK GAAP). As permitted by Section 408 of the 
Companies Act 2006, the profit and loss account is not presented. The profit for the year amounted to £236,000 (31 August 
2010: £12,000). Details of the Auditors’ remuneration payable by the Company are disclosed in Note 7 to the Consolidated 
Financial Statements on page 50. 
2 PRINCIPAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES 
The principal accounting policies set out below have been consistently applied to all the periods presented. 
Foreign currencies 
Foreign currency transactions are translated using the exchange rate at the date of transaction. Foreign exchange gains 
and losses arising from the settlement of transactions and from the translation at the year end exchange rates of 
monetary assets and liabilities are recognised in the profit and loss account. 
Investments in subsidiary undertakings 
Investments in subsidiary undertakings are included at cost less provision for impairment in value. 
Deferred taxation 
Deferred taxation is provided on the incremental liability approach in respect of timing differences giving rise to an asset or 
liability. Deferred taxation assets are recognised to the extent that it is regarded as more likely than not that they will be 
recovered. Deferred taxation assets and liabilities are not discounted. 
Share-based payments 
The Company operates equity-settled share-based option plans. The fair value of the employee services received in 
exchange for the participation in the plan is recognised as an expense in the profit and loss account. In accordance with 
UITF 44: Group and Treasury Transactions, the Company has accounted for options granted to the employees of subsidiary 
undertakings as capital contributions, which have been recharged to the intermediate company holding the investment. 
The corresponding credit has been recognised in the profit and loss account reserve. 
The fair value of the employee service is based on the fair value of the equity instrument granted. This expense is spread 
over the vesting period of the instrument. The corresponding entry is credited to equity. The liability for social security costs 
arising in relation to the awards is measured at each reporting date based upon the share price at the reporting date and 
the elapsed portion of the relevant vesting periods to the extent that it is considered that a liability will arise. 
Dividends 
Dividend distributions to the Company’s shareholders are recognised in the period when paid or, if earlier, in which the 
dividend is approved by the Company’s shareholders.

APPENDIX TO NOTICE OF ANNUAL GENERAL MEETING

SUMMARY OF THE PRINCIPAL TERMS OF THE ARMOUR 2012 COMPANY SHARE OPTION PLAN 
The Armour 2012 Company Share Option Plan (the “Option Plan”) provides for the grant of rights to acquire shares by way 
of purchase and, subject to the limitations set out below, by subscription to eligible employees of the Company and its 
subsidiaries (the “Group”). The Option Plan provides for the grant of both approved and unapproved options. Such options 
are not transferrable and are not pensionable benefits. 
1 ELIGIBILITY 
Options may only be granted to employees and full-time executive Directors of the Group. The Board of Directors of the 
Company (the “Directors”) will have a discretion as to the selection of executives to whom options may be granted. Decisions 
concerning the grant of an option must be approved by the Remuneration Committee of the Directors (the “Committee”). 
2 GRANT OF OPTIONS 
There are no specific restrictions on the grant of unapproved options save for any market practices that may apply in which 
the decision of the Committee will be final and conclusive. 
Approved options may be granted within the period ending 42 days after the date on which the HMRC formally approves 
the Option Plan. Thereafter approved options may only be granted within the period of 42 days following an announcement 
of the Company’s interim or annual results and within the period of 14 days after a new employee first joins the Group, but 
otherwise only in circumstances judged by the Committee to be exceptional. 
No option may be granted more than ten years after the date on which the Option Plan is adopted by the Company. 
3 THE EXERCISE PRICE 
The price per share at which shares may be acquired upon the exercise of an option shall be determined by the Committee 
at the time of grant but shall not be less than the higher of: 
(a) the market value of a share at the date of grant; and 
(b) in the case of options to subscribe for shares, the nominal value of an ordinary share. 
4 PERFORMANCE-RELATED CONDITIONS OF EXERCISE 
An option will normally become vested in respect of any number or proportion of the shares over which it is granted only if 
the applicable performance targets, set by the Committee, are met or exceeded. The Committee may from time to time vary 
any performance-related conditions as they apply to outstanding options if, in their opinion, to do so would more effectively 
achieve the objective of affording realistic incentives to optionholders or produce a fairer measure of performance. 
The Option Plan provides for standard performance targets based upon growth in the Company’s earnings per ordinary 
share and/or increase in the Company’s average share price. 
5 EXERCISE OF OPTIONS 
An option is exercisable normally only after the third anniversary of the date of grant and then only in respect of the 
number or proportion of the option shares which have become immediately exercisable (“vested”) in consequences of 
the performance target(s) having been met. An option cannot in any event be exercised later than the tenth anniversary 
of the date of grant. 
If the optionholder dies in service his/her options may be exercised by his personal representatives within twelve months 
thereafter in respect of (a) vested shares or, if the optionholder dies before the end of the performance period, (b) a 
proportion of the option shares which are deemed to have vested corresponding to such proportion of the period over 
which performance is measured (“the performance period”) has elapsed before the date of death. 
If the optionholder retires from employment, then within three months thereafter an option may be exercised in respect 
of vested shares. The extent to which options, which have not completed the performance period, may be exercised is 
at the discretion of the Committee (whose decision will be final and conclusive) and if deemed exercisable must be 
so exercised within three months of the retirement date.  Armour Group plc 
ANNUAL REPORT 2011
ANNUAL GENERAL MEETING
APPENDIX TO NOTICE OF ANNUAL GENERAL MEETING 
CONTINUED 
74 
If the optionholder leaves the Group by reason of injury, ill health, disability, redundancy or dismissal (other than through 
misconduct or impropriety), or the company in which he/she is employed is sold outside the Group, then within three 
months thereafter an option may be exercised in respect of vested shares, and an option may be exercised in respect of 
a proportion of the option shares as determined by the Committee (whose decision will be final and conclusive) taking into 
account such proportion of the performance period as has then elapsed and the performance of the optionholder as 
against the performance targets to that point. 
If an optionholder leaves the Group for any other reason, or options are not exercised within the prescribed periods, his/her 
options forthwith cease and determine. 
6 DEMERGER, RECONSTRUCTION OR WINDING-UP 
Early exercise of options within specified periods is permitted (with the consent of the Committee) in the event of a 
demerger or statutory reconstruction of the Company. If notice is given to shareholders of a resolution for the voluntary 
winding-up of the Company, options may be exercised at any time before the winding-up of the Company. Otherwise all 
unexercised options will lapse upon the commencement of a winding-up. 
7 TAKEOVER OF THE COMPANY 
In the event of a change of control of the Company in consequence of a takeover bid, options may be exercised early. 
8 RIGHTS ATTACHING TO SHARES 
Shares issued or transferred upon the exercise of options will rank equally in all respects with all other ordinary shares of 
the Company for the time being in issue save as regards any rights attaching to ordinary shares by reference to a record 
date prior to the allotment or transfer of such shares. 
9 LIMITS ON THE ISSUE OF ORDINARY SHARE CAPITAL UNDER THE OPTION PLAN 
There is a limit, of 15% of issued ordinary share capital, on the new shares over which options to subscribe for shares 
(“subscription options”) may be granted under the Option Plan and any other executive employee share scheme in any 
periods of ten years (“the 15% limit”). Options granted by the trustee of the Armour Employees’ Share Trust and which 
are to be satisfied by the purchase of existing shares by the trustee in the market will not count towards the 15% limit. 
10 INDIVIDUAL LIMITATIONS 
There is a limit, of four times current salary, on the initial market value of shares over which unexercised options to 
acquire shares may be held by an executive under all option schemes operated by the Company. The aggregate market 
value of shares (as at the date(s) of grant) over which unexercised approved options may be held by an individual at any 
time is limited to £30,000 or such other statutory limit on the grant of options under an HMRC approved company share 
option scheme as may apply from time to time. 
11 VARIATION OF SHARE CAPITAL 
In the event of a variation in the ordinary share capital of the Company, the Committee may adjust the number of shares 
subject to any option and/or the exercise price provided that: 
(a) no such adjustment to approved options may be made without the prior approval of HMRC; and 
(b) except in the case of a subdivision, consolidation or capitalisation issue, any such adjustment must be confirmed 
in writing by the Auditors to be in their opinion fair and reasonable. 
12 AMENDMENT OF THE OPTION PLAN 
The Committee may amend the Option Plan in any respect but may not make any alteration or addition to the advantage of 
existing or new optionholders to the provisions relating to eligibility, the overall and individual limits to the Option Plan, the 
basis for determining optionholders’ entitlements to the shares, or the adjustment of such entitlements on a variation of 
share capital without the prior approval of ordinary shareholders in general meeting except for minor amendments to 
benefit the administration of the Option Plan, to take account of any change in legislation or to obtain or maintain 
favourable taxation, exchange controls of regulatory treatment for optionholders or any member of the Group. Any 
amendment relating to approved options will not take effect until HMRC has confirmed that it will not affect its approved 
status.

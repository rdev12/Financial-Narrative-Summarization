Chairman’s statement
  
CHAIRMAN’S STATEMENT
Against a backdrop of considerable 
market and political uncertainty, the 
group has made good progress. 
Discretionary funds under 
management grew organically in all 
areas of the business and revenues 
and profits increased while we 
continued to invest in the business.
Underlying pre-tax profit for the year 
was £15 .5m (2015: £15 . 1m), a rise of 
3%, although underlying earnings per 
share have fallen to 87 . 92p (2015: 
91 . 33p) . Statutory pre-tax profits for 
the year grew by 39% to £15 . 9m (2015: 
£11 . 4m), the scale of the increase 
resulting from a reduction in the 
estimated deferred consideration 
payable in future years to the vendors 
of Levitas Investment Management 
Services Limited .
The board is recommending a final 
dividend of 23 . 0p per share which, if 
approved by shareholders, will result 
in total dividends for the year of 35 . 0p . 
This is an increase of 15% over the 
total dividends paid the previous year 
of 30 .5p per share . The final dividend 
will be paid on 28 October 2016 to 
shareholders on the register at the 
close of business on 30 September 
2016 . We remain cash generative and 
have a strong balance sheet .
The EU referendum had an effect on 
our results . In the first half of the 
financial year we decided to postpone 
the launch of two new funds . In the 
second half, investment returns were 
challenging and in the final quarter 
investor sentiment was certainly 
weaker . In spite of these market 
conditions, our discretionary funds 
under management grew strongly 
over the year to over £8 . 30bn (2015: 
£7 . 41bn), a rise of 12 . 0% . This 
compares favourably to the growth of 
the WMA Balanced index of 4 . 6% . 
We will maintain our investment 
across the business to sustain our 
continued growth . This covers 
investment in research, governance, 
IT, distribution, marketing and most 
importantly our staff . Markets have 
improved since the EU referendum, 
but sentiment remains volatile . 
Despite the uncertainties surrounding 
our exit from the EU and the 
associated market volatility, we 
believe the strength of our investment 
proposition will enable us to deliver 
good risk-adjusted returns for our 
clients .
Brooks Macdonald was established 
twenty-five years ago, with three of its 
founders continuing to be actively 
involved in the business: Chris 
Macdonald, Jon Gumpel and Richard 
Spencer . From a modest office in Park 
Street employing a handful of people, 
the business has grown into a highly 
successful investment management 
group with twelve offices and nearly 
500 staff . We are proud of Brooks 
Macdonald’s history and confident 
that we can continue to build on what 
has been achieved over the last 
quarter century . The future, we 
believe, is bright .

CHIEF EXECUTIVE’S REVIEW
Chris Macdonald Chief Executive
Introduction
This has been a good year for the 
business in spite of some signifi cant 
headwinds . This would not have been 
possible without the hard work and 
dedication of all our staff  throughout 
our twelve offi  ces and I would like to 
thank them for making these results 
possible .
In the fi rst six months of the year, we 
continued to grow discretionary funds 
under management and our planned 
move away from advisory work in our 
International business . In the second 
half, investment markets remained 
challenging but organic growth of 
discretionary funds remained robust 
and we have made substantive 
progress in our distribution model .
We have continued with our IT system 
development, working with three 
external providers . This is always 
complex and the time scale for 
completion has now moved to mid 
2017 , but I am pleased to report that 
this still remains on budget . In 
addition, we have completed our 
‘brand refresh’ . As well as modernising 
the look and feel of our marketing 
collateral, this has fi rmly positioned 
the business as an Investment 
Management business, as this remains 
the key driver of our growth . In line 
with this strategy, we will be moving 
our funds and UK asset management 
business into one brand, Investment 
Management, in early 2017 (subject to 
regulatory approvals) . 
Business review
Our discretionary funds under 
management rose to over £8 .3bn, an 
increase of over £880m over the 
fi nancial year . This represents an 
increase of 12 .0%, of which 11 .7% was 
new business (£863m) and 0 .3% 
(£25m) investment growth . We 
concluded no acquisitions in the year 
and this growth was largely generated 
internally, predominantly via our 
work with professional introducers . 
We continue to work with an 
increasing number (now over 960) of 
high-quality professional 
intermediaries throughout the UK and 
overseas . Pleasingly, our work with 
this sector shone through in the 
Citywire Regional Stars awards, where 
professional advisers voted Brooks 
Macdonald their preferred 
discretionary fund manager in 5 of 6 
regions of the UK . We remain highly 
focussed on providing a high-quality 
service to this sector and thank them 
for their continued support . 
Our bespoke discretionary portfolio 
service (‘BPS’) remains the premium 
off ering for high-net-worth clients . 
This continues to gain traction with 
private clients, pension and trust 
funds . Pension funds (principally Self 
Invested Personal Pensions - ‘SIPPs’) 
and increasingly ISA portfolios remain 
a substantial opportunity . We remain 
confi dent that the need for an 
incentive to save remains and that 
tax-effi  cient wrappers will form a key 
component of any strategy in this 
We are well positioned strategically, have a strong 
balance sheet, are growing our brand, have high-quality 
staff  across the group, are working with an increasing 
number of professional intermediaries and are 
constantly developing our investment off ering.  04  |  Brooks Macdonald Group plc  |  Annual Report and Accounts 2016

Business review continued
space . On and offshore we now 
manage over £6 . 4bn via our BPS 
service .
Our managed portfolio service (‘MPS’) 
is for smaller clients and can be 
accessed as a portfolio or via a unit 
managed around a series of risk based 
mandates . Our portfolio assets now 
exceed £617m and units £241m . We 
remain of the view that this will be a 
strong area of growth in the short, 
medium and long term .
In addition to risk-rated funds, we 
manage specialist funds which will 
also move under our new single brand 
later in the new financial year . Over the 
last year and into this financial year, we 
have streamlined our offering to 
ensure that we have funds that are of 
scale . Subject to market conditions, we 
will also look to launch further new 
products into the market place .
The full integration of our 
international business into the group 
continued . The teams based in the 
Channel Islands have worked hard to 
move the business from a blend of 
advisory and discretionary business 
towards acting fully as a discretionary 
manager . This process continues and 
while the financial results are 
disappointing, I am pleased with the 
progress made in expanding our 
distribution network outside the UK .
We have made a number of 
management changes in Braemar 
Estates, our specialist property 
manager . These started to contribute 
to growth in the second half . Assets 
under administration declined 
marginally over the year (-3 . 1%) .
Our financial planning business 
continued the trend of the prior year . 
Consulting work rose while employee 
benefits had a difficult year . Work 
generated into our Investment 
Management business remains robust 
and we will be looking to launch a 
pension default fund for our 
employee-benefit clients early this 
financial year .
Industry background
Regulatory changes continue apace, 
with a major focus on MiFID II . This 
has been postponed until January 
2018, but we are ensuring the 
business is well prepared for the 
substantial changes around 
transaction and client reporting . 
During the financial year, we have 
seen further consolidation in our 
sector . I believe that with the 
increasingly high costs of providing a 
quality investment service, back office 
administration and a robust 
governance structure, consolidation 
will continue . We remain firmly 
committed to remaining independent 
and will certainly look at acquisition 
opportunities when they arise .
Strategies for growth 
We continue to focus on our core 
strategies for growth: organic, service 
and performance development, as 
well as ongoing investment in the 
business, in particular on improving 
our technological delivery . This 
remains a constant .
Our main strategic focus remains 
working with quality professional 
advisers . There were 14,491 Adviser 
firms in the UK at the end of 2015 
(source: APFA) of whom around 2,500 
fall into our immediate target market . 
Currently we work with around 
one-third of this universe and are 
excited at the prospect of making 
further progress here .
Strategic Alliances form a major part 
of our strategy and I am pleased that 
the number of firms we have these 
relationships with has increased to 19 . 
As well as working with over 960 firms 
in the UK and overseas, we are looking 
to deepen our relationships with them 
and have launched a telephone 
support team to expand our offering 
to the wider community .
Our regional offices have been a major 
success for the business since our first 
office opened outside London in 2005 . 
This has allowed us to service clients 
and professional advisers from a 
regional office as well recruiting 
high-quality staff throughout the UK 
and Channel Islands . 
In addition to recruitment, we are 
always looking to enhance and 
expand our range of services . In this 
financial year, we will look to expand 
our charity proposition, a Tier 1 
service for overseas investors and 
launch a default fund as above .
With our recent brand refresh, we will 
also look to continue the development 
of our brand further . We are 
developing an exciting social media 
presence, have just renewed our 
sponsorship of Middlesex County 
Cricket Club and have won a number 
of investment and property awards 
over the last year . We also remain one 
of the very few firms with 5-star 
ratings from Defaqto for 2016 .
Summary and outlook
While it has been a challenging year, it 
has been highly productive . We are 
well positioned strategically, have a 
strong balance sheet, are growing our 
brand, have high-quality staff across 
the group, are working with an 
increasing number of professional 
intermediaries and are constantly 
developing our investment offering . 
We have made a good start to the new 
financial year and can look forward 
with confidence .

Total revenue
Total group revenue grew by 5% during the year compared to 12% in the previous year due mainly to a reduction in revenue 
in the Channel Islands where there was a fall in revenue of over 12% compared to an increase in 2015 of 14% . During the year 
we decided to more closely align the services in Jersey and Guernsey with the investment management service in the UK and 
reduced the number of advisory and execution only clients which had a significant impact on the transactional revenue 
generated in the year . A number of these clients have transferred their funds to a discretionary mandate which we expect will 
generate a longer term and more consistent revenue stream for the business . 
We saw revenue growth during the year of 8% in the investment management business and increased revenues for our funds 
business, financial planning and estates business over the year .

Operating costs 
As in previous years, the major part of the operating costs for the group are in relation to our staff (57%; 2015: 59%) and during 
the year we saw a small increase in the average number of employees from 467 to 472 . Of the total staff costs 24% (2015: 24%) 
were variable costs . We have continued to invest in our IT systems across all parts of the group, to improve the services 
offered to our clients . In our investment management business we are working on a large IT project to provide a more fully 
integrated system which will cover both onshore and offshore clients . We have assembled an internal project team and are 
working with three external software providers . The project has already delivered an improved client portal and a new client 
relationship management system to work with our professional intermediaries . Once complete during the financial year 
2018 the system will provide increased capacity with reduced risk and will deliver operational efficiencies .
We continue to operate in an increasingly regulated environment and we have again strengthened our legal, risk and 
compliance departments by additional recruitment over the last financial year . In 2016 we have seen the levy paid to the 
Financial Services Compensation Scheme (‘FSCS’) stabilise at £0 .5m (2015: £0 .5m) .
Net financial income and gains
When the group makes an acquisition it typically structures the deal whereby there are deferred payments to the 
vendors over a number of years against pre-agreed funds under management targets . Where these targets change due 
to unpredictable variables such as new business, client retention and market movements then the value of the 
deferred consideration changes and these fair value adjustments are made through the Consolidated Statement of 
Comprehensive Income . 
During the year one of the original FUM targets for Levitas was not achieved, resulting in a reduction in the amount payable to 
the vendors of the business . Accordingly, as more fully explained in note 22 to the financial statements, there was a fair value 
reduction of £3 . 3m resulting in a gain to Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income . 
Included in total net financial income and gains for the year of £2 . 3m is this fair value reduction for Levitas, together with 
other financial income, costs and the group’s share of joint venture results as detailed on the Consolidated Statement of 
Comprehensive Income and the accompanying notes .
As disclosed more fully in note 16 to the consolidated financial statements, the group has an investment in a student 
accommodation fund . During the year the shareholders of the fund approved the sale of the underlying property assets, 
which resulted in an impairment charge of £0 . 3m (2015: £0 . 7m) . 
Underlying profit before tax 
Underlying profit before tax and underlying earnings per share are non GAAP alternative performance measures, considered 
by the board to be a better reflection of true business performance than looking at the group’s results on a statutory basis only . 
These measures are widely used by research analysts covering the company . Underlying results exclude expenditure falling 
into the categories explained below and a full reconciliation between underlying profit and the profit attributable to 
shareholders is provided in the following table .

Group performance continued
Amortisation of intangible assets (note 14)
As explained in notes 2(d) and 2(m), client relationship intangible assets are created in the course of acquiring funds under 
management . The amortisation charge associated with these assets and software represents a significant non-cash item and 
it has therefore been excluded from underlying profit, which represents largely cash-based earnings .
Finance cost and changes in fair value of deferred consideration
When the group makes acquisitions of both corporate entities and teams of fund managers in the course of acquiring funds 
under management the typical structure of the acquisition, in order to continue to incentivise and motivate the vendors, is to 
make deferred payments over a period of time based on the retention and growth in funds under management . The initial 
estimated fair value of the deferred payments will be based on future projections of funds under management and where the 
actual payment is different from the original estimates then charges or credits will be made in arriving at the profit before tax . 
The directors consider that the effect of these changes to the original projected payments can distort the results of a 
particular period and have therefore excluded them from underlying profit . 
Initial estimates of the deferred cash payments are recognised in the financial statements at their present value based on an 
inherent rate of implied interest . The difference between the discounted present value of deferred consideration and the 
estimated future cash payment is recognised as a charge over the duration of the deferral period in arriving at profit before 
tax . The directors consider that this charge, which is a non-cash item, can distort the results of a particular period and have 
therefore excluded the charge from underlying profit .
Acquisition costs
The acquisition costs in 2015 were incurred in relation to the purchase of Levitas Investment Management Services Limited . 
There were no acquisitions made during this financial year .
Cash resources and regulatory capital
The group is cash generative and, as detailed in the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows on page 29, there was an increase 
in cash resources at the year end of £0 . 2m to £19 .5m (2015: £19 . 3m) . The group had no borrowings at 30 June 2016 (2015: 
£nil) .
As required under Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) rules and both Jersey and Guernsey Financial Services Commissions 
we perform a regular Internal Capital Adequacy Assessment Process (ICAAP) and Adjusted Net Liquid Asset (ANLA) 
calculation which includes performing a range of stress tests to determine the appropriate level of regulatory capital and 
liquidity that the group needs to hold . Surplus levels of capital are forecast taking into account investment requirements and 
proposed dividends to ensure that appropriate buffers are maintained . The group’s Pillar 3 disclosures are published 
annually on our website (www . brooksmacdonald . com) .
Segmental review
The group reports its results in four key operating segments: Investment management; Financial planning; Funds and 
property management; and International . 
Investment management 
The UK based investment management service continues to remain the core part of the group contributing 72% (2015: 70%) 
of the group turnover . Investment management principally provides discretionary investment management to private 
investors, pension funds, charities and trusts through BPS and MPS . Despite considerable changes within the industry and 
volatility within the financial markets we have continued to grow FUM as shown in the table on page 6 . 
Financial planning
The financial consulting business continues to deliver both fee based financial planning advice to high net-worth families, 
and employee benefit consultancy to small and medium sized employers throughout the UK . Numbers of clients increased 
over the course of the year and the division remains a major introducer of new investment management funds to the group . 
During the year there was further investment in systems and staff and, despite the uncertain economic climate, revenue 
increased to £4 . 3m (2015: £4 . 1m) resulting in a small loss for the year of £0 . 1m (2015: £0 . 1m) .

Group performance continued
Segmental review continued
Funds and property management
It has been another year of growth for the funds business across the range of funds it manages . Total FUM increased by 20% to 
£796m (2015: £663m) at 30 June 2016 . This growth was achieved both organically through the net new investment across 
the range of funds with particularly strong flows of new money into the multi asset funds .
The Ground Rents Income Fund performed well during the year with an increase in the net asset value . It was the intention to 
launch two further property related funds in the second half of the year but due to the result of the EU referendum these were 
postponed and will be reviewed again during the next financial year . 
During the year, as a result of slower than anticipated growth of the Liquid Property Fund, the business recognised an 
impairment charge against its investment in North Row Capital LLP (NRC), in which it has a 60% share, of £0 . 4m (2015: £nil) 
together with a share of the losses of NRC for the year of £0 . 1m (2015: £0 . 0m) .
The estates business had an improved year although the value of assets under management marginally declined to £1 . 10bn 
(2015: £1 . 14bn) . Following a strategic review of the business and some changes to the board, additional revenue streams were 
identified which saw an increase in turnover of 9% over the previous year despite the fall in the value of assets under 
management . As a result the estates business broke even for the year compared to a loss of £0 . 4m in 2015 . 
International
The business saw an increase of FUM during the year of 16% to £1 . 35bn (2015: £1 . 16bn) with new business from a number 
of sources and new jurisdictions including South Africa and the conversion of previously non-managed advisory and 
execution clients . 
As advised at the half year the planned conversion of advisory accounts to discretionary accounts saw a significant reduction 
in the transactional income of the business during the year with total revenues for the International business falling by 12% . 
Whilst the associated costs of the advisory clients have been reduced these have not matched the timing of the loss of 
revenue and together with increased legal fees in the year, particularly dealing with some legacy issues prior to the 
acquisition, the profit for the year has fallen to £0 .5m (2015: £1 . 3m) .
The growth in the FUM and the expanded sources of international introductions together with the further rationalisation of 
the core client proposition in line with that offered in the UK means that the board believes that the business will see an 
increase in profit in the next financial year .
The new Brooks Macdonald brand
As part of the plans for the continued growth of the group, working together with specialist consultants we reviewed and 
relaunched our brand in April 2016 . 
As part of the review we ascertained from both internal and external sources the key characteristics of the group and how we 
were identified principally by our clients, professional intermediaries and staff . 
We work extensively with professional intermediaries and so in reference to this the new brand was designed to unify all of 
the group services under a single Brooks Macdonald brand . This would be used both in the UK and internationally, and 
positions us as a investment manager of choice around our core offering .
The brand emphasises the ethos of the group – striking a balance between our professional and technical expertise and the 
way we support our clients and various partners . It encapsulates our core values of honesty, fairness and clarity . From a new 
logotype through to a new style and tone, the brand will implant these values within all of our literature and communications, 
on our new website and on our secure client portal . Through these channels, it will provide our clients, partners and staff with 
assurance of the quality of our business .

The new Brooks Macdonald brand continued
Ultimately, the new brand will help us raise awareness within the increasingly competitive environment in which we operate . 
It will help us provide the best possible service to our clients, thereby maximising growth in our FUM and improving our 
profitability . It will also allow us to maintain the culture and ethos that has made us successful . 
Corporate governance
A review of the company’s corporate structure has been conducted and this will result in changes to our corporate structure 
which will take effect at the beginning of the next financial year . These changes are designed to improve the governance 
arrangements for our key operating businesses . Historically, each subsidiary has been run as an independent company; 
however, in future, key strategic decisions will be made on a group basis . Day-to-day management of underlying businesses 
will be undertaken by a management committee, which will report to the group executive committee . We believe this 
approach will permit more effective management of resources . 
As a result of our improved governance arrangements, our asset management and funds subsidiaries will be managed 
through one single management committee as an investment management business line . This will improve investment 
governance by ensuring our risk and investment management controls are applied uniformly across our various products 
and services .
Governance arrangements at the group level remain unchanged . The principal board committees are audit, remuneration 
and risk and compliance, each of which has specific terms of reference which are periodically reviewed by the board . These 
terms of reference are available on the group website .
Audit Committee
The key responsibilities of the Audit Committee are:
• to review the group’s accounting procedures and internal financial controls;
• to review the reporting of financial and other information to the shareholders of the company and to monitor the integrity of the 
financial statements;
• to review the effectiveness of the external audit process and the independence and objectivity of the external auditors; and
• to report to the board on how it has discharged its responsibilities .
The membership of the committee comprises three non-executive directors: Richard Price (Chairman), Christopher Knight 
and Colin Harris . The board is satisfied that all members of the committee have recent and relevant financial experience . In 
addition, committee meetings are normally attended by the Group Chief Executive Officer, the Finance Director and by 
representatives of the external auditors . The committee meets with representatives of the external auditors without 
management present at least once a year .
The committee met five times during the year with meetings structured around the financial calendar of the company .
Risk and Compliance Committee
The group’s risk-management framework is designed to ensure risks are identified, managed and reported effectively at 
every level . At an operational level, first-line systems and controls are employed to monitor compliance with internal policies 
and procedures . In the second line of defence, compliance monitoring carries out independent checks . Output from both is 
reported to the relevant management committee and relevant management information is reported to the business-level risk 
committee, the executive committee, and the Risk and Compliance Committee through the group’s escalation policy . The risk 
department works with each business unit to conduct a programme of risk and control assessments throughout the year and 
the output from these is also reported to the relevant management committee, the relevant risk committee, executive 
committee and the Risk and Compliance Committee as appropriate . Identified risks at each business unit are recorded in a 
risk register and reported up through the risk committee structure, ultimately to the group board Risk and Compliance 
Committee, where required in accordance with the group escalation policy .

Corporate governance continued
Risk and Compliance Committee continued
The membership of the Risk and Compliance Committee is made up of the group’s four non-executive directors and is chaired 
by the senior independent director, Colin Harris . Business managers and representatives from the legal, risk and compliance 
functions attend committee meetings as necessary to report on monitoring output, the results of risk and control assessments 
and changes to the risk register . The group board Risk and Compliance Committee is principally responsible for monitoring 
identified risks and the effectiveness of mitigating action, keeping risk assessment processes under review, assessing 
material breaches of risk limits and reviewing client complaints .
The Risk and Compliance Committee met on six occasions during the year ended 30 June 2016 .
The group’s risk mitigation framework is subject to on-going review .
The principal risks identified as having a potential material impact on the group are detailed below, together with the 
principal means of mitigation .
Financial risks
The group’s principal financial risks relate to credit risk, liquidity risk and market risk and the measures and policies for the 
management of those risks are set out in note 32 to the consolidated financial statements . Further details on capital 
management processes can be found in note 33 .
Non-financial risks
The significant non-financial risks faced by group have been reviewed by the committee, which believes they remain broadly 
the same as in previous years and are as follows:
Reputational  risk
Impact
The group has a growing reputation as a provider of high 
quality investment and wealth management services . There 
is a risk that significant damage to reputation could lead to 
the loss of existing clients as well as impacting on the ability 
to gain new clients, which would lead to a fall in financial 
income . Such risk could arise from events such as poor 
investment performance, poor client service or regulatory 
censure .
Mitigation 
This risk is minimised by ensuring the group maintains a 
culture of high ethical and professional standards whilst 
focussing on delivering a first class service to all of our 
clients . The group maintains separate, independent risk and 
compliance departments, which ensures conformity with 
the regulations of the Financial Conduct Authority, as well as 
relevant statutes, in all of our dealings with our clients .
Regulatory risk
Impact
The sector in which the group operates is heavily regulated 
and any breach of regulations could lead to fines or 
disciplinary action against the group or its staff .
Mitigation
The group monitors compliance with existing law and 
regulations and keeps abreast of future changes to assess the 
likely business impact and to ensure that the group has 
sufficient resources to implement any necessary changes .
People risk
Impact
Our business is dependent on client relationships with our 
staff . Operating in a competitive market there is a risk of loss 
of existing clients due to poor performance or service, a 
failure to respond to changes in the market place, or the loss 
of key investment professionals .
Mitigation
To minimise this risk, the group continues to invest in its 
employees and monitors developments in the marketplace 
in which it operates to ensure that the group continues to 
offer a wide range of services . Recruitment policies are 
designed to attract high quality staff and the group regularly 
reviews and validates its remuneration packages and 
contractual arrangements and motivation is measured 
through a sentiment index . Structured training is provided 
by the group’s learning & development team .

Corporate governance continued
Risk and Compliance Committee continued
Non-financial risks continued
Information Communication Technology (‘ICT’) risk
Impact
A key part of the high quality service delivered to clients is 
facilitated by a flexible and robust internal ICT 
infrastructure . Ancillary areas of ICT risk include system 
development, ICT operations, ICT support and 
telecommunications .
Mitigation
New ICT projects are regularly reviewed and appraised at 
board meetings in order to ensure that the group continues 
to develop and maintain its ICT capabilities . Business 
continuity is assured through our network of offices and our 
remote working capabilities .
Outsourcing risk
Impact
Where key systems are provided by outsourced providers, 
there is a risk of failure of the outsourcing partners or 
external suppliers . There are further risks in the onboarding 
of outsourcing partners and ongoing support from them .
Mitigation
Due diligence takes place prior to the commencement of any 
outsourcing or supply, to maintain a robust procurement 
process and good contract governance . We keep our key 
outsourcing partners under review and have in place 
procedures to regularly assess the performance of such 
suppliers as well as identifying suitable and viable 
alternatives .
Operational risk
Impact
There is a risk that the group suffers a loss of business 
resulting from inadequate or failed internal processes, 
people and systems .
Mitigation
The group employs a comprehensive risk-management 
framework, which comprises ongoing monitoring and 
reporting of operational areas by first-line and second-line 
controls . The risk function works with businesses to conduct 
risk and control assessments, and external auditors provide 
further ad hoc checks .
Investment performance risk
Impact
There is a risk that portfolios will not meet their investment 
objectives which could result in the group suffering loss of 
business . There is a risk on the suitability of portfolios for 
clients and where the suitability responsibility lies between a 
professional introducing the client and the group company .
Mitigation
Portfolio performance, valuations and risk profiles are 
monitored by management, allowing issues to be identified 
and mitigated as they arise . The group has in place BITA 
Monitor portfolio risk oversight tools to assist with 
supervising portfolio management . The group keeps its 
client documentation under review and updates it regularly 
to ensure clients are properly informed about investment 
policy and risks .
Remuneration Committee
The Remuneration Committee comprises Diane Seymour-Williams (Chair), Christopher Knight and Colin Harris . The 
committee (in consultation with the Chief Executive) determines the specific remuneration packages for each executive 
director and certain senior executives including base salary, annual bonus, long-term incentives, benefits and terms of 
employment . The committee is also responsible for setting the broad parameters for the annual base salary review for all staff 
across the group and reviews all awards made under various long-term incentive schemes operated by the group . 
Remuneration policy
Brooks Macdonald recognises the importance of its employees to the success of the group and consequently the 
remuneration policy is designed to be market competitive in order to attract, retain and motivate high-calibre individuals . 
The committee has reviewed the numerous regulatory changes and guidelines to ensure that the remuneration policies 
across the business are in line with best practice . External third party data is used to validate rather than to benchmark the 
total reward .

Corporate governance continued
Remuneration Committee continued
The remuneration policy, which applies to directors and employees of the group and was approved by shareholders at the 
AGM on 27 October 2015, is based on the following key principles: 
• designed to encourage the retention of staff through deferred variable compensation, where appropriate; 
• the need to provide a market competitive balanced package of benefits;
• inclusion of both annual and long term elements;
• fair for both the director and the company with some element of discretion;
• differentiation by merit and performance;
• an emphasis on variable, performance driven remuneration bonus payments funded from retained profits;
• compliant with financial services rules and regulations;
• alignment with shareholders’ interests with significant long term equity participation; and 
• clarity, transparency and fairness of process .
The current remuneration package for an executive director has four main elements: basic salary and benefits, profit related 
bonus, long-term equity based incentives and pension . The total reward is designed to include a balance of fixed and variable 
pay with an element of deferral .
The remuneration of directors in 2016 and 2015 is set out in the table below . Executive director remuneration includes legacy 
LTIP awards made in 2012 and 2011 that vested in the year .

Notes 
1 
 The annual bonus represents the cash amount receivable for the relevant financial year . An additional amount of 20% for each executive director is deferred and 
awarded by way of ordinary shares under the terms of the long term incentive scheme ( LTIS) as disclosed below in table 2 .
2 
 The amounts represent the value vested in the year from three year LTIS awards arising from the deferred element of the 2012 annual bonus together with any 
additional awards made on similar terms . The awards satisfied the performance conditions requiring an increase in the diluted earnings per share of the company of 
at least 2% per annum more than the increase in the RPI over the period of three financial years starting with the financial year in which the date of the grant falls and 
ending with the financial year in which the third anniversary of the date of the grant falls . The vesting date was 25 October 2015 and the market price on 23 October 
2015, the day nearest to the vesting date, was £17 .34 .
3 
 The amounts represent the value vested in the year from three year LTIS awards arising from the deferred element of the 2011 annual bonus together with any 
additional awards made on similar terms . The awards satisfied the performance conditions requiring an increase in the diluted earnings per share of the company of 
at least 2% per annum more than the increase in the RPI over the period of three financial years starting with the financial year in which the date of the grant falls and 
ending with the financial year in which the third anniversary of the date of the grant falls . The vesting date was 20 October 2014 and the market price on that date 
was £13 .42 .
Notes to the single total figure of remuneration for each director table
Basic salary
Basic salary is paid monthly in cash through payroll determined by the committee and any changes are implemented from 
1 July each year or when an individual changes position or responsibility . In deciding appropriate levels the committee 
considers salaries throughout the group and information on comparable companies of a similar size and complexity 
provided by advisers to the committee . The views of the Chief Executive are taken into consideration when setting the salary 
of other directors . The base salaries of executive directors were increased on 1 July 2015 by a total of 2 .5% compared to an 
overall average increase for all employees of 3 . 1% .
Non-executive directors’ fees
The non-executive directors’ fees were similarly reviewed and increased on average by 8 . 8% with the approval of the board to 
reflect their additional responsibilities and commitments as the group grows .
The Chairman’s fee was increased from £90,000 to £92,000 on 1 August 2015 and the basic non-executive director’s fee was 
increased from £40,000 to £42,000 on 1 August 2015 . Non-executive directors also receive an additional responsibility fee of 
£4,000 per annum in recognition of their chairing a committee or being the senior independent director .
Taxable benefits 
Benefits are provided to the directors to complement the remuneration package and may include, for example private 
medical insurance for directors and their dependants, death in service cover, critical illness and permanent health insurance, 
annual medicals, Save As You Earn scheme, and the provision of interest free season ticket loans .
Taxable benefits are the provision of private medical insurance for the executives and their dependants and the provision of 
interest free season ticket loans as disclosed in note 35 to the consolidated financial statements .
Annual bonus
Awards to executive directors and some other senior employees of the group of profit related bonuses are made from a pool 
of profits of 5-15% of the group pre-tax profit after the payment of all bonuses to all other staff . As disclosed in note 22 to the 
consolidated financial statements there was an increase in the group pre-tax profit during the year of £3 . 34m in respect of 
changes in the deferred consideration on the acquisition of Levitas and given the ‘one-off’ and exceptional nature of this item 
the committee excluded this amount in the consideration of the size of the bonus pool for this year . 
The committee determines the overall size of the pool based on the performance of the group against a number of key 
performance indicators including the growth in profits, the movement in funds under management, various internal client 
service metrics and the performance against budget of each of the operating divisions . 
The total payment to executive directors in respect of the year ended 30 June 2016, including the amounts deferred into 
shares, represents 8 . 8% (2015: 9 . 8%) of group pre-tax profit . The total bonus payment to all senior employees who participate 
in this scheme is 12 . 2% (2015: 12 . 8%) .

Notes to the single total figure of remuneration for each director table continued
Annual bonus continued
Awards to individual executive directors are determined by the committee following objectives and measures proposed 
by chief executive, taking into account a number of financial and non-financial factors . These are intended to give a broad 
assessment of the annual performance objectives of each director, including the results of the business, investment 
performance, net new business, management of risks facing the group and cost control within each individual’s area 
of responsibility . 
The Remuneration Committee has decided that 20% of the bonus awarded will be made in shares deferred for a period of 
three years under a Long Term Incentive Scheme (LTIS) . In addition, directors may choose to defer a further amount of any 
bonus awarded, up to a maximum of 20%, making 40% in total, into shares under the LTIS . 
Long Term Incentive Scheme (‘LTIS’) and Employee Benefit Trust (‘EBT’)
The group established an EBT on 3 December 2010 in order to acquire ordinary shares in the company in connection with the 
deferred share element of the profit related bonus under the LTIS as detailed above . The EBT is also used for other long-term 
awards to members of the board and senior employees of the group .
The Remuneration Committee has made additional awards under the LTIS to certain executive directors and senior 
employees . The additional awards are subject to the same performance and other conditions as those applying to the 
deferred profit related bonus share options . 
The LTIS awards reported are the historic awards vesting at the end of the three year cycle valued using the share price on the 
date of the vesting . In addition to the deferred element of the annual bonus described above the executive directors are 
awarded rights to acquire ordinary shares . The scheme has performance conditions attached to the deferred award, 
requiring a minimum growth in the diluted earnings per share of the group of 2% per annum above the increase in the Retail 
Price Index (RPI) over the three year period . 
In the case of a ‘bad’ leaver, all unvested awards will normally lapse . A ‘bad’ leaver is a director who leaves other than on 
retirement, redundancy, due to ill health or on the sale of the business unless the committee determines otherwise .
Pensions
Executive directors may participate in the pension arrangements of the group or receive cash in lieu of pension on the same 
basis as other employees . The group’s contributions are currently 15% of base salary .

This benefit is the value of the discount on the Sharesave options granted in the year .

Sharesave Scheme
All directors are entitled to take part in the HMRC approved Brooks Macdonald Group Sharesave Scheme on the same terms 
as all other employees . Annual invitations to participate in the scheme, which commences each year on 1 June, are sent to 
directors and option grants are made at 80% of the closing mid market price on the day of the offer . 
Enterprise Management Incentive Scheme (‘EMI’) 
The Brooks Macdonald Group Enterprise Management Incentive Scheme (EMI) was adopted by the shareholders of the 
Company on 11 February 2005 . 
Options granted can be exercised if there has been an increase in the diluted earnings per share of the Company of at least 2% 
per annum more than the increase in the RPI over the period of three financial years starting with the financial year in which 
the date of grant falls and ending with the financial year in which the third anniversary of the date of grant falls .

Corporate governance continued
Remuneration Committee continued
Enterprise Management Incentive Scheme (‘EMI’) continued
Options may not normally be exercised before the third anniversary of the date of the grant and expire on the tenth 
anniversary of the grant . Due to the increase in the size of the Company it is no longer eligible under HMRC rules to grant 
options under this EMI scheme and the last options were awarded to directors under this scheme on 17 October 2007 .
Company Share Option Plan (‘CSOP’)
Following discussions regarding remuneration structures and incentives schemes for senior employees and directors the 
Company decided to set up a CSOP which was approved by shareholders at the annual general meeting on 17 October 2013 
and by HMRC on 21 November 2013 .
The scheme is a discretionary scheme whereby employees or directors are granted an option to purchase the Company’s 
shares in the future at a price set on the date of the grant . The maximum award under the terms of the scheme for an 
individual at any one time is a total market value of £30,000 . There are performance conditions attaching to the scheme 
similar to those in place for the EMI Scheme above whereby there must be an increase in the diluted earnings per share of the 
Company of 2% more than the increase in the RPI over the three years starting with the financial year in which the option is 
granted .
Dilution
Not more than 15% of the issued ordinary share capital of the Company (adjusted for bonus and rights issues) will be issued 
for all EMI and share incentive schemes operated by the Company in any ten year rolling period . The Company satisfies the 
various equity-based schemes it operates using a combination of market purchased, newly issued and treasury shares .
Service contracts for executive directors
The Company has service contracts with its executive directors with a notice period of 12 months and it is company policy 
that such contracts should not normally contain periods of more than 12 months .
External appointments
Executive directors are encouraged to take on external appointments as non-executive directors but are discouraged from 
taking more than one other position given the time commitment . Prior approval of any new appointment is required by the 
Board with any fees in excess of £15,000 per annum paid to the Company .
Non-executive directors
Non-executive directors do not have contracts of employment but as with other directors are now required to stand for 
re-election . The executive directors are responsible for determining the fees of the non-executive directors who do not 
receive pension or other benefits from the group and do not participate in any group incentive schemes .

The group considers that 
communication with our employees 
is very important and indeed vital for 
the success of the group . Employees 
are informed of important issues by

training needs to their line managers, 
which are then co-ordinated through

Development department .
The group operates a graduate 
training scheme in respect of its 
trainee investment fund managers

The group is an equal opportunities 
employer . All job applicants and 
employees are treated fairly and on 
merit, regardless of their race, gender, 
marital status, age, disability, religious 
belief or sexual orientation . 
Applications from disabled persons 
are always considered and where 
employees become disabled efforts 
are made to continue their 
employment within the group by 
providing training and the supply of 
equipment if necessary so that they 
are able to continue their role . 
All staff have the option to take an 
interest free annual season ticket loan . 
To retain the group’s employees and 
to improve staff morale, the group 
recognises the need for employees to 
have an appropriate work-life balance . 
Long serving employees are entitled

Statement of directors’ responsibilities
  
STATEMENT OF DIRECTORS’ RESPONSIBILITIES
 
The directors are responsible for 
preparing the Annual Report, the 
Directors’ Remuneration Report and 
the financial statements in accordance 
with applicable law and regulations .
Company law requires the directors to 
prepare financial statements for each 
financial year . Under that law the 
directors have prepared the group and 
parent company financial statements 
in accordance with International 
Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) 
as adopted by the European Union . 
Under company law the directors 
must not approve the financial 
statements unless they are satisfied 
that they give a true and fair view of 
the state of affairs of the group and the 
company and of the profit or loss of 
the company and group for that 
period . In preparing these financial 
statements, the directors are 
required to:
• select suitable accounting policies 
and then apply them consistently;
• make judgements and accounting 
estimates that are reasonable and 
prudent;
• state whether applicable IFRSs as 
adopted by the European Union and 
IFRSs issued by IASB have been 
followed, subject to any material 
departures disclosed and explained 
in the financial statements; and
• prepare the financial statements on 
the going concern basis unless it is 
inappropriate to presume that the 
company will continue in business .
The directors are responsible for 
keeping adequate accounting records 
that are sufficient to show and explain 
the company’s transactions and 
disclose with reasonable accuracy at 
any time the financial position of the 
company and the group and enable 
them to ensure that the financial 
statements and the Directors’ 
Remuneration Report comply with 
the Companies Act 2006 and, as 
regards the group financial 
statements, Article 4 of the IAS 
Regulation . They are also responsible 
for safeguarding the assets of the 
company and the group and hence for 
taking reasonable steps for the 
prevention and detection of fraud and 
other irregularities .
The directors are responsible for the 
maintenance and integrity of the 
company’s website . Legislation in the 
United Kingdom governing the 
preparation and dissemination of 
financial statements may differ from 
legislation in other jurisdictions .
The directors consider that the 
Annual Report and Accounts, taken as 
a whole, is fair, balanced and 
understandable and provides the 
information necessary for 
shareholders to assess a company’s 
performance, business model and 
strategy . 
Each of the directors, whose names 
and functions are listed in the Report 
of the directors confirm that, to the 
best of their knowledge:
• the group financial statements, 
which have been prepared in 
accordance with IFRSs as adopted 
by the EU, give a true and fair view of 
the assets, liabilities, financial 
position and profit of the group; and
• the Strategic report and the Report 
of the directors include a fair review 
of the development and 
performance of the business and the 
position of the group, together with a 
description of the principal risks and 
uncertainties that it faces .   Brooks Macdonald Group plc  |  Annual Report and Accounts 2016  |  23

INDEPENDENT AUDITORS’ REPORT
TO THE MEMBERS OF BROOKS MACDONALD GROUP PLC
 
Report on the group  
financial statements
Our opinion
In our opinion, Brooks Macdonald 
Group plc’s group financial statements 
(the ‘financial statements’):
• give a true and fair view of the state 
of the group’s affairs as at 30 June 
2016 and of its profit and cash flows 
for the year then ended;
• have been properly prepared in 
accordance with International 
Financial Reporting Standards 
(‘IFRSs’) as adopted by the European 
Union; and
• have been prepared in accordance 
with the requirements of the 
Companies Act 2006 .
What we have audited
The financial statements, included 
within the Annual Report & Accounts 
(the ‘Annual Report’), comprise:
• the Consolidated Statement of 
Financial Position as at 30 June 201 6;
• the Consolidated Statement of 
Comprehensive Income for the year 
then ended;
• the Consolidated Statement of Cash 
Flows for the year then ended;
• the Consolidated Statement of 
Changes in Equity for the year then 
ended; and
• the notes to the financial statements, 
which include a summary of 
significant accounting policies and 
other explanatory information .
The financial reporting framework 
that has been applied in the 
preparation of the financial 
statements is IFRSs as adopted by the 
European Union, and applicable law .
In applying the financial reporting 
framework, the directors have made a 
number of subjective judgements, for 
example in respect of significant 
accounting estimates . In making 
such estimates, they have made 
assumptions and considered 
future events .
Opinion on other matter 
prescribed by the Companies 
Act 2006
In our opinion, the information given 
in the Strategic Report and the Report 
of the Directors for the financial year 
for which the financial statements are 
prepared is consistent with the 
financial statements .
Other matters on which we are 
required to report by exception
Adequacy of information and 
explanations received
Under the Companies Act 2006 we are 
required to report to you if, in our 
opinion, we have not received all the 
information and explanations we 
require for our audit . We have no 
exceptions to report arising from this 
responsibility . 
Directors’ remuneration
Under the Companies Act 2006 we are 
required to report to you if, in our 
opinion, certain disclosures of 
directors’ remuneration specified by 
law are not made . We have no 
exceptions to report arising from this 
responsibility . 
Responsibilities for the 
financial statements and 
the audit
Our responsibilities and those of 
the directors
As explained more fully in the 
Statement of Directors’ 
Responsibilities set out on page 22, 
the directors are responsible for the 
preparation of the financial 
statements and for being satisfied 
that they give a true and fair view .
Our responsibility is to audit and 
express an opinion on the financial 
statements in accordance with 
applicable law and International 
Standards on Auditing (UK and 
Ireland) (‘ISAs (UK & Ireland)’) . Those 
standards require us to comply with 
the Auditing Practices Board’s Ethical 
Standards for Auditors .
This report, including the opinions, 
has been prepared for and only for the 
parent company’s members as a body 
in accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 
16 of the Companies Act 2006 and for 
no other purpose . We do not, in giving 
these opinions, accept or assume 
responsibility for any other purpose 
or to any other person to whom this 
report is shown or into whose hands it 
may come save where expressly 
agreed by our prior consent in writing .
What an audit of financial statements 
involves
We conducted our audit in 
accordance with ISAs (UK & Ireland) . 
An audit involves obtaining evidence 
about the amounts and disclosures in 
the financial statements sufficient to 
give reasonable assurance that the    Brooks Macdonald Group plc  |  Annual Report and Accounts 2016  |  25
Independent auditors’ report
to the members of Brooks Macdonald Group plc | continued
INDEPENDENT AUDITORS’ REPORT
TO THE MEMBERS OF BROOKS MACDONALD GROUP PLC | 
C O NT I N U E D
financial statements are free from 
material misstatement, whether 
caused by fraud or error . This includes 
an assessment of: 
• whether the accounting policies are 
appropriate to the group’s 
circumstances and have been 
consistently applied and adequately 
disclosed; 
• the reasonableness of significant 
accounting estimates made by the 
directors; and 
• the overall presentation of the 
financial statements . 
We primarily focus our work in these 
areas by assessing the directors’ 
judgements against available 
evidence, forming our own 
judgements, and evaluating the 
disclosures in the financial 
statements .
We test and examine information, 
using sampling and other auditing 
techniques, to the extent we consider 
necessary to provide a reasonable 
basis for us to draw conclusions . We 
obtain audit evidence through testing 
the effectiveness of controls, 
substantive procedures or a 
combination of both .
Responsibilities for the 
financial statements and  
the audit continued
What an audit of financial statements 
involves continued
In addition, we read all the financial 
and non-financial information in the 
Annual Report to identify material 
inconsistencies with the audited 
financial statements and to identify 
any information that is apparently 
materially incorrect based on, or 
materially inconsistent with, the 
knowledge acquired by us in the 
course of performing the audit . If we 
become aware of any apparent 
material misstatements or 
inconsistencies we consider the 
implications for our report .
Other matter
We have reported separately on the 
parent company financial statements 
of Brooks Macdonald Group plc for the 
year ended 30 June 2016 .

CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF CASH FLOWS
FOR THE YEAR ENDED 30 JUNE 2016 30  |  Brooks Macdonald Group plc  |  Annual Report and Accounts 2016
Notes to the consolidated financial statements
for the year ended 30 June 2016 
NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
FOR THE YEAR ENDED 30 JUNE 2016
1. General information
Brooks Macdonald Group plc (‘the Company’) is the parent company of a group of companies (‘the group’), which offers a 
range of investment management services and related professional advice to private high net worth individuals, charities 
and trusts . The group also provides financial planning as well as offshore fund management and administration services and 
acts as fund manager to regulated OEICs, providing specialist funds in the property and structured return sectors and 
managing property assets on behalf of these funds and other clients .
The Company is a public limited company, incorporated and domiciled in the United Kingdom under the Companies Act 
2006 and listed on AIM . The address of its registered office is 72 Welbeck Street, London, W1G 0AY .
2. Principal accounting policies
The general accounting policies applied in the preparation of these financial statements are set out below . These policies have 
been applied consistently to all years presented, unless otherwise stated .
a) Basis of preparation
The group’s consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting 
Standards (IFRS) and IFRS Interpretations Committee (IFRS IC) interpretations, as adopted by the European Union and the 
Companies Act 2006 applicable to companies reporting under IFRS . The financial statements have been prepared on the 
historical cost basis, except for the revaluation of available for sale financial assets such that they are measured at their 
fair value .
At the time of approving the financial statements, the directors have a reasonable expectation that the Company and the 
group have adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future . Accordingly, they continue to 
adopt the going concern basis in preparing the financial statements .
b) Basis of consolidation
The group’s financial statements are a consolidation of the financial statements of the Company and its subsidiaries . The 
underlying financial statements of the subsidiaries are prepared for the same reporting year as the Company, using consistent 
accounting policies . Subsidiaries and structured entities are all entities controlled by the Company, deemed to exist where 
the Company is exposed to, or has rights to, variable returns from its involvement with the entity and has the ability to affect 
those returns through its power over the entity . The financial statements of the subsidiaries are included from the date on 
which control is transferred to the group to the date that control ceases .
All intercompany transactions and balances between group companies are eliminated on consolidation .
The group has disclosed all of its subsidiary undertakings in note 42 of the parent company’s financial statements . 
c) Changes in accounting policies
The group’s accounting policies that have been applied in preparing these financial statements are consistent with those 
disclosed in the Annual Report and Accounts for the year ended 30 June 2015, except as explained below .
New accounting standards, amendments and interpretations adopted in the period
In the year ended 30 June 2016, the group did not adopt any new standards or amendments issued by the IASB or 
interpretations issued by the IFRS Interpretations Committee (IFRS IC) that have had a material impact on the consolidated 
financial statements .   Brooks Macdonald Group plc  |  Annual Report and Accounts 2016  |  31

 C O NT I N U E D
New accounting standards, amendments and interpretations adopted in the period continued
Other new standards, amendments and interpretations listed in the table below were newly adopted by the group but have 
not had a material impact on the amounts reported in these financial statements . They may however impact the accounting 
for future transactions and arrangements .

New accounting standards, amendments and interpretations not yet adopted
A number of new standards, amendments and interpretations, which have not been applied in preparing these financial 
statements, have been issued and are effective for annual periods beginning after 1 July 2015:

† 
Not yet endorsed for use in the EU
The impact of these changes is currently being reviewed and there is no intention to early adopt .
IFRS 16 ‘Leases’ is expected to have a significant impact on the group’s future consolidated financial statements . This new 
standard will require the recognition a right-of-use asset and associated lease liability for the office premises that are leased 
by the group . The asset would be depreciated over the lease term and the liability would accrue interest, resulting in a 
front-loaded expense profile . This accounting treatment contrasts with the current treatment for operating leases, where no 
asset or liability is recognised and the lease payments are charged to the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income 
on a straight line basis over the term of the lease . 
IFRS 9 ‘Financial Instruments’ could change the classification and measurement of financial assets . IFRS 15 ‘Revenue from 
Contracts with Customers’ could change how and when revenue is recognised from contracts with customers . The extent of 
their impact has not yet been fully determined . 32  |  Brooks Macdonald Group plc  |  Annual Report and Accounts 2016
Notes to the consolidated financial statements

2. Principal accounting policies continued
d) Critical accounting estimates and judgements
The preparation of financial information requires the use of assumptions, estimates and judgements about future conditions . 
Use of currently available information and application of judgement are inherent in the formation of estimates . Actual results 
in the future may differ from those reported . In this regard, the directors believe that the accounting policies where 
judgement is necessarily applied are those that relate to the measurement of intangible assets, deferred consideration, the 
estimation of the fair value of share-based payments and client compensation provisions .
The underlying assumptions made are reviewed on an ongoing basis . Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the 
period in which the estimate is revised only if the revision affects both current and future periods .
Further information about key assumptions and sources of estimation uncertainty are set out below .
Intangible assets
The group has acquired client relationships and the associated investment management contracts as part of business 
combinations (as described in note 13), through separate purchase and purchased with newly employed teams of fund 
managers (as described in note 14) . In assessing the fair value of these assets the group has estimated their finite life based on 
information about the typical length of existing client relationships . Contracts acquired with fund managers and acquired 
client relationship contracts are amortised on a straight line basis over their estimated useful lives, ranging from 5 to 20 years .
Goodwill recognised as part of a business combination is reviewed annually for impairment, or when a change in 
circumstances indicates that it might be impaired . The recoverable amounts of cash generating units are determined by 
value in use calculations, which require the use of estimates to derive the projected future cash flows attributable to each unit . 
Details of the more significant assumptions are given in note 14 .
Deferred consideration
As described in note 22, the group has a deferred consideration balance in respect of the acquisition of Levitas Investment 
Management Services Limited in July 2014 . Deferred consideration is recognised at its fair value, being an estimate of the 
amount that will ultimately be payable in future periods . This has been calculated allowing for estimated growth in the 
acquired funds, discounted by the estimated cost of capital . The group considers that reasonably possible changes to these 
assumptions would not result in a material change in the fair value of the deferred consideration . 
Share-based payments
The group operates various share-based payment schemes in respect of services received from certain employees . Estimating 
the fair value of these share-based payments requires the group to apply an appropriate valuation model and determine the 
inputs to that model (notes 24 and 29) . The charge to the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income in respect of 
share-based payments is calculated using assumptions about the number of eligible employees that will leave the group and 
the number of employees that will satisfy the relevant performance conditions . These estimates are reviewed regularly .
Provisions 
In the ordinary course of business, the group may receive complaints from clients in relation to the services provided . 
Complaints are assessed on a case-by-case basis and provisions are made where it is judged to be likely that compensation 
will be paid .
e) Exceptional items
Exceptional items are disclosed and described separately in the financial statements where it is necessary to do so to provide 
further understanding of the underlying financial performance of the group . These include material items of income or 
expense that are shown separately due to the significance of their nature or amount .
f) Business combinations
Business combinations are accounted for using the acquisition method . The cost of an acquisition is measured at the fair 
value of the aggregate amount of the consideration transferred at the acquisition date, irrespective of the extent of any 
minority interest . Acquisition costs are charged to the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income in the year 
of acquisition .
d) Critical accounting estimates and 
judgements
f) Business combinations   Brooks Macdonald Group plc  |  Annual Report and Accounts 2016  |  33
Notes to the consolidated financial statements
for the year ended 30 June 2016 | continued
2. Principal accounting policies continued
f) Business combinations continued
When the group acquires a business, it assesses the financial assets and liabilities assumed for appropriate classification and 
designation in accordance with the contractual terms, economic circumstances and pertinent conditions at the acquisition 
date . If the business combination is achieved in stages, the fair value of the group’s previously held equity interest is 
re-measured at the acquisition date and the difference is credited or charged to the Consolidated Statement of 
Comprehensive Income . Identifiable assets and liabilities assumed on acquisition are recognised in the Consolidated 
Statement of Financial Position at their fair value at the date of acquisition .
Any contingent consideration to be paid by the group to the vendor is recognised at its fair value at the acquisition date . 
Subsequent changes to the fair value of contingent consideration are recognised in accordance with IAS 39 in the 
Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income .
Goodwill is initially measured at cost, being the excess of the consideration transferred over the acquired company’s net 
identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed . If the consideration is lower than the fair value of the net assets acquired, 
the difference is recognised as a gain on a bargain purchase in the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income .
Impairment
Goodwill and other intangible assets with an indefinite life are tested annually for impairment . For the purposes of 
impairment testing, goodwill acquired in a business combination is allocated to each of the group’s cash generating units that 
are expected to benefit from the combination, irrespective of whether other assets or liabilities of the acquisition are assigned 
to those units . The carrying amount of each cash generating unit is compared to its recoverable amount, which is determined 
using a discounted future cash flow model .
Where goodwill forms part of a cash-generating unit and part of the operation within that unit is disposed of, the goodwill 
associated with the operation disposed of is included in the carrying amount of the operation when determining the gain or 
loss on disposal of the operation . Goodwill disposed of in this circumstance is measured based on the relative values of the 
operation disposed of and the portion of the cash generating unit retained .
g) Fees, commissions and interest
Portfolio management and other advisory and custody services are billed in arrears but are recognised over the period the 
service is provided . Fees are calculated on the basis of a percentage of the value of the portfolio over the period . Dealing 
charges are levied at the time a deal is placed for a client . Fees are only recognised when the fee amount can be estimated 
reliably and it is probable that the fee will be receivable . Amounts are shown net of rebates paid to significant investors .
Performance fees are earned from some clients when contractually agreed performance levels are exceeded within specified 
performance measurement periods . They are only recognised, at the end of these performance periods, when a reliable 
estimate of the fee can be made and it is almost certain that it will be received .
Financial consulting fees are charged to clients using an hourly rate or by a fixed fee arrangement and are recognised over the 
period the service is provided . Commissions receivable and payable are accounted for in the period in which they are earned .
Where amounts due are conditional on the successful completion of fund raising for investment vehicles, revenue is 
recognised where, in the opinion of the directors, there is reasonable certainty that sufficient funds have been raised to enable 
the successful operation of that investment vehicle . Amounts due on an annual basis for the management of third party 
investment vehicles are recognised on a time apportioned basis .
Interest receivable is recognised on an accruals basis .
h) Cash and cash equivalents 
Cash comprises cash in hand and call deposits held with banks . Cash equivalents comprise short-term, highly liquid 
investments, with a maturity of less than three months from the date of acquisition . 34  |  Brooks Macdonald Group plc  |  Annual Report and Accounts 2016
Notes to the consolidated financial statements
for the year ended 30 June 2016 | continued
2. Principal accounting policies continued
i) Share-based payments
Equity-settled schemes 
The group engages in equity-settled share-based payment transactions in respect of services received from certain 
employees . The fair value of the services received is measured by reference to the fair value of the shares or share options on 
the grant date . This cost is then recognised in the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income over the vesting period, 
with a corresponding credit to equity .
The fair value of the options granted is determined using option pricing models, which take into account the exercise price of 
the option, the current share price, the risk free rate of interest, the expected volatility of the Company’s share price over the 
life of the award and other relevant factors .
Cash settled schemes 
The group engages in cash settled share-based payment transactions in respect of services received from certain employees . 
On the grant date, the liability is measured at its fair value . The liability is subsequently re-measured at the end of each 
reporting period and on the date of settlement, with any changes in fair value recognised in the Consolidated Statement of 
Comprehensive Income . The cost of the services received from employees in respect of this scheme is recognised in the 
Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income with a corresponding credit to accruals .
j) Segmental reporting 
The group determines and presents operating segments based on the information that is provided internally to the group 
Board of Directors, which is the group’s chief operating decision maker . 
k) Fiduciary activities 
The group commonly acts as trustee and in other fiduciary capacities that result in the holding or placing of assets on behalf 
of individuals, trusts, retirement benefit plans and other institutions . These assets and income arising thereon are excluded 
from these financial statements, as they are not assets of the group .
The group holds money on behalf of some clients in accordance with the client money rules of the Financial Conduct 
Authority . Such monies and the corresponding liability to clients are not included within the Consolidated Statement of 
Financial Position as the group is not beneficially entitled thereto .
l) Property, plant and equipment 
All property, plant and equipment is included in the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position at historical cost less 
accumulated depreciation and impairment . Costs include the original purchase cost of the asset and the costs attributable to 
bringing the asset into a working condition for its intended use .
Provision is made for depreciation to write off the cost less estimated residual value of each asset, using a straight line 
method, over its expected useful life as follows:
   
Fixtures and fittings 3 to 6 . 67 years
   
Equipment 5 years
   
Leasehold improvements over the term of the lease
   
Motor vehicles 4 years
  
The assets’ residual values and useful economic lives are reviewed, and adjusted if appropriate, at the end of each reporting 
period . Gains and losses arising on disposal are determined by comparing the proceeds with the carrying amount . These are 
included in the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income .    Brooks Macdonald Group plc  |  Annual Report and Accounts 2016  |  35
Notes to the consolidated financial statements
for the year ended 30 June 2016 | continued
2. Principal accounting policies continued
m) Intangible assets
Amortisation of intangible assets is charged to administrative expenses in the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive 
Income on a straight line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets (4 to 20 years) .
Acquired client relationship contracts and contracts acquired with fund managers
Intangible assets are recognised where client relationship contracts are either separately acquired or acquired with 
investment managers who are employed by the group . These are initially recognised at cost and are subsequently amortised 
on a straight line basis over their estimated useful economic life . Separately acquired client relationship contracts are 
amortised over 15 to 20 years and those acquired with investment managers over 5 years . Both types of intangible asset are 
reviewed annually to determine whether there exists an indicator of impairment or an indicator that the assumed useful 
economic life has changed .
Computer software
Computer software costs are amortised on a straight line basis over an estimated useful life of four years .
Goodwill 
Goodwill arising as part of a business combination is initially measured at cost, being the excess of the fair value of the 
consideration transferred over the group’s interest in the net fair value of the separately identifiable assets, liabilities and 
contingent liabilities of the subsidiary at date of acquisition . In accordance with IFRS 3 ‘Business Combinations’, goodwill is 
not amortised but is reviewed annually for impairment and is therefore stated at cost less any provision for impairment of 
value . Any impairment is recognised immediately in the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income and is not 
subsequently reversed . Gains and losses on the disposal of an entity include the carrying amount of goodwill relating to the 
entity sold . On acquisition, any goodwill acquired is allocated to cash generating units for the purposes of impairment testing . 
If the cost of the acquisition is less than the fair value of the net assets of the subsidiary acquired, the difference is recognised 
directly in the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income .
n) Investments in joint ventures
A joint venture is an entity in which the group holds a long-term interest and is jointly controlled by the group and one or more 
third parties under a contractual agreement . Under the equity method of accounting, interests in joint ventures are initially 
recognised at cost in the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position and subsequently adjusted to reflect changes in the 
group’s share of the net assets of the entities . The group’s share of the results of joint ventures is included in the Consolidated 
Statement of Comprehensive Income .
If the group’s share of the losses of a joint venture equals or exceeds its investment, the group does not recognise further 
losses, unless it has incurred obligations or made payments on behalf of the joint venture .
o) Financial investments 
The group classifies financial assets in the following categories: fair value through profit or loss; available for sale; loans and 
receivables; and held-to-maturity . The classification is determined by management on initial recognition of the financial 
asset, which depends on the purpose for which it was acquired .
Fair value through profit or loss
Financial instruments are classified as fair value through profit or loss if they are either held for trading or specifically 
designated in this category on initial recognition . Assets in this category are initially recognised at fair value and 
subsequently re-measured, with gains or losses arising from changes in fair value being recognised in the Consolidated 
Statement of Comprehensive Income . 36  |  Brooks Macdonald Group plc  |  Annual Report and Accounts 2016
Notes to the consolidated financial statements
for the year ended 30 June 2016 | continued
2. Principal accounting policies continued
o) Financial investments continued
Available for sale
Available for sale financial assets are non-derivatives that are either specifically designated in this category or are not 
classified in any of the other categories . They are included in non-current assets unless the investment matures or 
management intends to dispose of it within 12 months of the end of the reporting period . Available for sale financial assets 
are initially recognised at fair value and are subsequently revalued based on the current bid prices of the assets as quoted in 
active markets . Changes in fair value are recognised directly in equity, through the Consolidated Statement of Changes in 
Equity, with the exception of impairment losses which are recognised in the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive 
Income . The cumulative gain or loss recognised in equity is recycled to the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive 
Income when an available for sale financial asset is derecognised or impaired .
Loans and receivables 
Loans and receivables are non-derivative assets with fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an active market . 
They are included in current assets except where they have maturities of more than 12 months after the end of the reporting 
period, in which case they are classified as non-current assets . The group’s loans and receivables are recognised within ‘trade 
and other receivables’ .
Held-to-maturity
Held-to-maturity financial assets are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinate payments and fixed maturities 
that the group’s management has the positive intention and ability to hold to maturity . Held-to-maturity financial assets are 
measured at amortised cost .
p) Provisions
Provisions are recognised when the group has a present obligation as a result of a past event, where it is probable that it will 
result in an outflow of economic benefits and can be reliably estimated . Provisions are measured at the present value of the 
expenditures expected to be required to settle the obligation using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market 
assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the obligation .
Client compensation 
Complaints are assessed on a case-by-case basis and provisions for compensation are made where it is judged necessary .
q) Foreign currency translation
The group’s functional and presentational currency is the Pound Sterling . Foreign currency transactions are translated using 
the exchange rate prevailing at the transaction date . At the reporting date, monetary assets and liabilities that are 
denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at the prevailing rates on that date . Foreign exchange gains and losses 
resulting from settlement of such transactions and from the translation of period-end monetary assets and liabilities are 
recognised in the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income .
r) Retirement benefit costs
Contributions in respect of the group’s defined contribution pension scheme are charged to the Consolidated Statement of 
Comprehensive Income as they fall due .
s) Taxation 
Tax on the profit for the year comprises current and deferred tax . Current tax is the expected tax payable on the taxable 
income for the year, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the reporting date, and any adjustment to tax payable 
in respect of previous years .
Deferred tax is provided in full, using the liability method, on temporary differences arising between the tax bases of assets 
and liabilities and their carrying amounts in the group’s financial statements . Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured 
at the tax rates that are expected to apply to the period when the asset is realised or the liability settled based on tax rates (and 
laws) that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the reporting date .

2. Principal accounting policies continued
s) Taxation continued
Deferred tax assets are only recognised to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profit will be available against 
which the temporary differences can be utilised .
t) Trade receivables 
Trade receivables are initially recognised and subsequently measured at the original invoice amount less an allowance for 
any amounts that are expected to be uncollectable . Doubtful debts are provided for when the collection of the full amount is 
no longer probable, whilst bad debts are immediately written off when identified .
u) Trade payables 
Trade payables are obligations to pay for goods or services that have been acquired in the ordinary course of business from 
suppliers . These are classified as current liabilities if payment is due within 12 months or less (or in the normal operating 
cycle of the business if longer) . Otherwise, they are presented as non-current liabilities in the Consolidated Statement of 
Financial Position .
Trade payables are initially recognised at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective 
interest method .
v) Operating lease payments 
Rent payments due under operating leases are charged to the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income on a 
straight line basis over the term of the lease . Where leases include lease incentives such as rent-free periods, the benefit of 
these incentives is recognised over the lease term as a reduction in the rental expense .
w) Financial instruments 
The group classifies financial instruments, or their component parts, on initial recognition as a financial asset, a financial 
liability or an equity instrument in accordance with the substance of the contractual arrangement . Financial instruments are 
recognised in the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position at fair value when the group becomes a party to the 
contractual provisions of the instrument .
x) Employee Benefit Trust (‘EBT’)
The Company provides finance to an EBT to purchase the Company’s shares on the open market in order to meet its 
obligation to provide shares when an employee exercises certain options or awards made under the group’s share-based 
payment schemes . The administration and finance costs connected with the EBT are charged to the Consolidated Statement 
of Comprehensive Income . The cost of the shares held by the EBT is deducted from equity . A transfer is made between other 
reserves and retained earnings over the vesting periods of the related share options or awards to reflect the ultimate 
proceeds receivable from employees on exercise . The trustees have waived their rights to receive dividends on the shares .
The EBT is considered to be a Structured Entity, as defined in note 36 . In substance, the activities of the trust are being 
conducted on behalf of the group according to its specific business needs, in order to obtain benefits from its operation . 
On this basis, the assets held by the trust are consolidated into the group’s financial statements .
y) Share capital
Ordinary share capital is classified as equity . Incremental costs directly attributable to the issue of new ordinary shares or 
options are shown in equity as a deduction, net of tax, from the proceeds .
Where the Company purchases its own equity share capital (treasury shares) the consideration paid, including any directly 
incremental costs (i . e . net of income taxes) is deducted from equity attributable to the Company’s equity holders until the 
shares are cancelled or reissued . Where such ordinary shares are subsequently reissued, any consideration received (net of 
any directly attributable incremental transaction costs and the related income tax effects) is included within equity 
attributable to the Company’s equity holders .

z) Dividend distribution
The dividend distribution to the Company’s shareholders is recognised as a liability in the group’s financial statements in 
the period in which the dividend is authorised and no longer at the discretion of the Company . Final dividends are recognised 
when approved by the Company’s shareholders at the annual general meeting and interim dividends are recognised 
when paid .
3. Segmental information
For management purposes the group’s activities are organised into four operating divisions: Investment management, 
Financial planning, Funds and property management and International . The group’s other activity, offering nominee and

10. Taxation continued
The tax on the group’s profit before tax differs from the theoretical amount that would arise using the time apportioned tax 
rate applicable to profits of the consolidated entities in the UK as follows: 
2016  
£’000
2015  
£’000
Profit on ordinary activities before tax 15,856 11,420
    
Profit on ordinary activities multiplied by the standard rate of tax in the UK of 20 . 00%  
 (2015: 20 . 75%) 3,171 2,370
Tax effect of:
– Lower tax rates in other countries in which the group operates (77)  (255)  
– Disallowable expenses (91)  385
– Change in rate of Corporation Tax applicable to deferred tax (334)  –
– Under provision / (over provision) in prior years 448 (231)  
    
Tax charge for the year 3,117 2,269
    
The deferred tax credits totalling £259,000 (2015: £276,000) represent a charge of £185,000 (2015: £28,000 charge) 
arising from the share option reserve at the balance sheet date, a credit of £35,000 (2015: £117 ,000 charge) relating to 
accelerated capital allowances and a credit of £409,000 (2015: £421,000) arising from the amortisation of acquired client 
relationship contracts .
On 1 April 2016, the standard rate of Corporation Tax in the UK was reduced to 20% . As a result the effective rate of 
Corporation Tax applied to the taxable profit for the year ended 30 June 2016 is 20 . 00% (2015: 20 . 75%) .
In addition to the change in the rate of UK Corporation Tax disclosed above, the Finance (No . 2) Act 2015, which was 
substantively enacted in October 2015, will further reduce the main rate of UK Corporation Tax to 19% in 2017 and 18% 
in 2020 . Deferred tax assets and liabilities are calculated at the rate that is expected to be in force when the temporary 
differences unwind, but limited to the extent that such rates have been substantively enacted . The tax rate used to 
determine the deferred tax assets and liabilities is therefore 18% (2015: 20%) and will be reviewed in future years subject to 
new legislation .
11. Earnings per share
The directors believe that underlying earnings per share provide a truer reflection of the group’s performance in the year . 
Underlying earnings per share are calculated based on ‘underlying earnings’, which is defined as earnings before acquisition 
costs, finance costs of deferred consideration, changes in the fair value of deferred consideration and amortisation of 
intangible assets . The tax effect of these adjustments has also been considered .
Earnings for the year used to calculate earnings per share as reported in these consolidated financial statements were 
as follows:
2016 
 £’000  
2015  
£’000
Earnings attributable to ordinary shareholders 12,739 9,151

Basic earnings per share is calculated by dividing earnings attributable to ordinary shareholders by the weighted average 
number of shares in issue throughout the year . Diluted earnings per share represents the basic earnings per share adjusted 
for the effect of dilutive potential shares issuable on exercise of employee share options under the group’s share-based 
payment schemes, weighted for the relevant period .
The weighted average number of shares in issue during the year was as follows:

a) Goodwill
Goodwill acquired in a business combination is allocated at acquisition to the cash generating units (‘CGUs’) that are expected 
to benefit from that business combination . The carrying amount of goodwill at 30 June 2016 comprises £3,550,000 in respect 
of the Braemar Group Limited (‘Braemar’) CGU, £21,243,000 in respect of the Brooks Macdonald Asset Management 
(International) Limited, Brooks Macdonald Retirement Services (International) Limited and DPZ (collectively ‘Brooks 
Macdonald International’) CGU and £11,213,000 in respect of the Levitas Investment Management Services Limited 
(‘Levitas’)  CGU .
Goodwill is reviewed annually for impairment and its recoverability has been assessed at 30 June 2016 by comparing 
the carrying amount of the CGUs to their expected recoverable amount, estimated on a value-in-use basis . The value-in-use of 
each CGU has been calculated using pre-tax discounted cash flow projections based on the most recent budgets approved by 
the relevant subsidiary company boards of directors, covering a period of up to five years . Cash flows are then extrapolated 
beyond the forecast period using an expected long-term growth rate .
Based on the value-in-use calculation, at 30 June 2016 the calculated recoverable amount of the Brooks Macdonald 
International CGU was £43,172,000, indicating that there is no impairment . The key underlying assumptions of the 
calculation are the discount rate, the short-term growth in earnings and the long-term growth rate of the business . A pre-tax 
discount rate of 8 . 45% has been used, based on the group’s assessment of the risk-free rate of interest and specific risks 
relating to Brooks Macdonald International . Annual earnings growth rates of between 23% and 65% are forecast over the next 
five financial years, the period covered by the most recent forecasts, which reflect historic actual growth and planned 
management actions and are considered to be achievable given current market and industry trends . The 2% long-term 
growth rate applied is considered prudent in the context of the long-term average growth rate for the funds, investment 
management and financial planning industries in which the CGU operates . 46  |  Brooks Macdonald Group plc  |  Annual Report and Accounts 2016

14. Intangible assets continued
a) Goodwill continued
In relation to the Levitas CGU, based on the value-in-use calculation the calculated recoverable amount at 30 June 2016 was 
£17 ,910,000, indicating that there is no impairment . The key underlying assumptions of the calculation are the discount rate, 
the growth in funds under management of the Levitas funds and the long-term growth rate of the business . A pre-tax discount 
rate of 8 . 45% has been used, based on the group’s assessment of the risk-free rate of interest and specific risks relating to 
Levitas . Annual funds under management growth rates of between 20% and 48% are forecast in the next five financial years, 
the period covered by the most recent forecasts, which reflect historic actual growth and planned management activities and 
are considered to be achievable given current market and industry trends . The 2% long-term growth rate applied is 
considered prudent in the context of the long-term average growth rate for the funds industry in which the CGU operates .
The key assumptions inherent in the value-in-use calculations for the Braemar CGU were similarly a pre-tax discount rate of 
8 . 45%, annual revenue growth rates ranging from 12% to 20% and a long-term growth rate of 2% . 
Significant headroom exists in the calculations of the respective recoverable amounts of these CGUs over the carrying 
amounts of the goodwill allocated to them . On this basis, the directors have concluded that there is no impairment . The 
directors consider that no reasonably foreseeable change in any of the key assumptions would result in an impairment of 
goodwill, given the margin by which the estimated recoverable amounts of the CGUs exceed the carrying amounts of the 
goodwill allocated to each .
b) Computer software
Software costs are amortised over an estimated useful life of four years on a straight line basis .
c) Acquired client relationship contracts
This asset represents the fair value of future benefits accruing to the group from acquired client relationship contracts . 
The amortisation of client relationships is charged to the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income on a straight 
line basis over their estimated useful lives (15 to 20 years) .
d) Contracts acquired with fund managers
This asset represents the fair value of the future benefits accruing to the group from contracts acquired with fund managers . 
Payments made to acquire such contracts are stated at cost and amortised on a straight line basis over an estimated useful life 
of five years .

16. Available for sale financial assets continued
The Student Accommodation Fund is promoted by Brooks Macdonald Funds Limited, a subsidiary of the group . The 
shareholders of the fund approved a resolution in May 2016 to sell the underlying property portfolio of the fund to a third 
party . The shares will subsequently be compulsorily redeemed out of the remaining net assets of the fund following the sale, 
although this process had not been completed at 30 June 2016 . The group has therefore estimated the fair value of the group’s 
investment at 30 June 2016 at £471,000 (2015: £782,000) based on the most recent information made available to investors 
about the consideration payable for the assets of the fund and the expected net asset value per share after adjusting for the 
costs associated with the sale . An impairment loss of £311,000 (2015: £718,000) was recognised in the Consolidated Statement 
of Comprehensive Income during the year, reflecting this perceived permanent diminution of value of the group’s shareholding .
During the year, the group realised an additional gain of £20,000 (2015: £540,000) on the final distribution of proceeds from 
the voluntary liquidation of Sancus Holdings Limited (‘SHL’), an unlisted company incorporated in Guernsey . The disposal of 
the group’s investment in SHL was recognised in the year ended 30 June 2015 and the gain is included within realised gain on 
investment in the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income . Further details are disclosed in note 16 to the 2015 
Annual Report and Accounts . 
At 30 June 2016, the fair value of the group’s GLIF preference shareholding was £744,000 (2015: £750,000), based on their bid 
price on the London Stock Exchange . The reduction in fair value of £6,000 (2015: £nil) is recognised within other 
comprehensive income in the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income .
During the year, the group acquired 500,000 redeemable preference shares in an unlisted company with a par value of £1 at a 
cost of £500,000 . The preference shares are redeemable at par any time after five years from the date of issue (8 April 2016) 
and bear an entitlement to a fixed preferential dividend of 8% per annum of the nominal value of the shares . The fair value of 
the preference shares has been estimated at £500,000 based on a discounted cash flow analysis .
The table below provides an analysis of the financial instruments that, subsequent to initial recognition, are measured at fair 
value . These are grouped into the following levels within the fair value hierarchy, based on the degree to which the inputs 
used to determine the fair value are observable:
• Level 1 – derived from quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities at the measurement date;
• Level 2 – derived from inputs other than quoted prices included within level 1 that are observable, either directly or indirectly; 
and 
• Level 3 – derived from inputs that are not based on observable market data .

Total 744 – 971 1,715
     
During the year, the Student Accommodation Fund investment was transferred from level 2 to level 3 . As no active market 
exists for the shares and there has been no recent announcement of the net asset value of the fund, the group has applied 
valuation techniques that are not based on observable market data .
17 . Investment in joint venture 
Brooks Macdonald Funds Limited, a subsidiary of Brooks Macdonald Group plc, holds a 60% interest in North Row Capital 
LLP, a UK Limited Liability Partnership . The group has joint control over the partnership, with the remaining interest owned 
by two individual partners who developed the investment approach behind the IFSL North Row Liquid Property Fund . The 
fund was launched in February 2014 and offers investors liquid exposure to global real estate markets .   Brooks Macdonald Group plc  |  Annual Report and Accounts 2016  |  49

An impairment loss of £400,000 was recognised during the year (2015: £nil) to reduce the carrying amount of the group’s 
investment in North Row Capital LLP to its estimated recoverable amount . The expense is included within other gains and 
losses on the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income . Based on the most recent forecasts, the future cash flows 
from the partnership will accumulate slower than originally anticipated and as a result it will take longer for the group to 
realise a cash return on its investment in the joint venture . 
18. Deferred income tax
Deferred income tax assets are only recognised to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profit will be available 
against which the temporary differences can be utilised . An analysis of the group’s deferred assets and deferred tax liabilities

22. Deferred consideration
Deferred consideration is split between non-current liabilities (see below) and provisions within current liabilities (note 25) to 
the extent that it is due for payment within one year of the reporting date . It reflects the directors’ best estimate of amounts 
payable in the future in respect of certain client relationships and subsidiary undertakings that were acquired by the group . 
Deferred consideration is measured at its fair value based on discounted expected future cash flows . The movements in the 
total deferred consideration balance during the year were as follows:

£9,218,000) were made during the year, representing the final payment of £524,000 to the vendor of JPAM Limited (‘JPAM’); 
the final payment of £2,130,000 to vendors of DPZ; and a further payment of £1,247 ,000 to vendors of Levitas . 52  |  Brooks Macdonald Group plc  |  Annual Report and Accounts 2016

22. Deferred consideration continued
A reduction in the fair value of deferred consideration of £3,571,000 (2015: £216,000) was recognised during the year, with a 
corresponding gain recognised within other gains and losses on the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income . This 
included an adjustment to reduce the fair value of deferred consideration in respect of Levitas by £3,343,000 . The amount 
payable is based on the incremental growth in FUM of the TM Levitas funds, measured at annual intervals . As forecast growth 
was not achieved during year, the FUM forecast was subsequently revised and the estimated future deferred consideration 
payments reduced accordingly . Adjustments were also made to reduce the fair value of the deferred consideration 
attributable to DPZ by £225,000 and JPAM by £3,000 to the amount of the final payments made to the vendors .
Deferred consideration is classified as Level 3 within the fair value hierarchy, as defined in note 16 .

the acquisition of Levitas) . An amount of £1,307 ,000 (2015: £5,247 ,000), representing deferred consideration payable in 
respect of the acquisition of Levitas, was transferred to provisions within current liabilities . A range of final outcomes for the 
expected total deferred consideration payable cannot be estimated as the future value of the funds under management is 
dependent on several unpredictable variables, including client retention and market movements .

29. Equity-settled share-based payments
All share options granted to employees under the group’s equity-settled share-based payment schemes are valued using a 
Black Scholes model, based on the market price of the Company’s shares at the grant date and annualised volatility of up to 
50%, covering the period to the end of the contractual life . Volatility has been estimated on the basis of the Company’s 
historical share price subsequent to flotation . The risk-free annual rate of interest is deemed to be the yield on a gilt edged 
security with a maturity term of 3 years, ranging from 0 . 30% to 2 . 00% .
For options granted during the year, the Black Scholes model was based on the market price of the Company’s shares at each 
respective grant date and volatility of 26% to 27% with a dividend yield of 1 . 77% to 2 . 06%, an expected vesting period of three 
years and a risk-free annual rate of interest of between 0 . 61% and 1 . 00% .
The share options issued under the various equity-settled share-based payment schemes have been valued at prices ranging 
from £0 .58 to £16 . 28 per share . The charge to the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income for the year in respect of 
these was £943,000 (2015: £1,315,000) . The weighted average remaining contractual life of all equity-settled share-based 
payment schemes at 30 June 2016 was 1 . 48 years (2015: 1 . 62 years) . The weighted average share price of all options

CSOP is a discretionary scheme whereby employees or directors are granted an option to purchase the Company’s shares in 
the future at a price set on the date of the grant . The maximum award under the terms of the scheme is a total market value of 
£30,000 per recipient . The performance conditions attached to the scheme require an increase in the diluted earnings per 
share of the Company of 2% more than the increase in the RPI over the three years starting with the financial year in which 
the option is granted .

32. Financial risk management
The group has identified the financial risks arising from its activities and has established policies and procedures as part of a 
formal structure for managing risk, including establishing risk lines, reporting lines, mandates and other control procedures . 
The structure is reviewed regularly . The group does not use derivative financial instruments for risk management purposes .
a) Liquidity risk
Liquidity risk is the risk that the group is unable to meet its payment obligations associated with its financial liabilities when 
they fall due .
The primary objective of the group’s treasury policy is to manage short-term liquidity requirements and to ensure that the 
group maintains a surplus of immediately realisable assets over its liabilities, such that all known and potential cash 
obligations can be met .
The table below shows the cash inflows and outflows from the group under non-derivative financial assets and liabilities, 
together with cash and bank balances available on demand .

b) Market risk 
Interest rate risk
The group may elect to invest surplus cash balances in short-term cash deposits with maturity dates not exceeding three 
months . Consequently, the group has a limited exposure to interest rate risk due to fluctuations in the prevailing level of 
market interest rates .
A 1% fall in the average monthly interest rate receivable on the group’s cash and cash equivalents would have the impact of 
reducing interest receivable and therefore profit before taxation by £195,000 (2015: £190,000) . An increase of 1% would have 
an equal and opposite effect .
Foreign exchange risk
The group does not have any material exposure to transactional foreign currency risk and therefore no analysis of foreign 
exchange risk is provided .
Price risk
Price risk is the risk that the fair value of the future cash flows from financial instruments will fluctuate due to changes in 
market prices (other than those arising from interest rate risk or currency risk) . The group is exposed to price risk through its 
holdings of equity securities and other financial assets, which are measured at fair value in the Consolidated Statement of 
Financial Position (notes 16 and 20) . A 1% fall in the value of these financial instruments would have the impact of reducing 
total comprehensive income by £27 ,000 (2015: £15,000) and profit before tax by £nil (2015: £nil) . An increase of 1% would 
have an equal and opposite effect .
c) Credit risk
The group may elect to invest surplus cash balances in highly liquid money market instruments with maturity dates not 
exceeding three months . The difference between the fair value and the net book value of these instruments is not material . 
To reduce the risk of a counterparty default, the group deposits the rest of its funds in approved, high quality banks . At 30 
June 2016 there was no significant concentration of credit risk in any particular counterparty (2015: none) .
Assets exposed to credit risk recognised on the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position total £19,478,000 (2015: 
£19,274,000), being the group’s total cash and cash equivalents .

Notes to the consolidated financial statements
for the year ended 30 June 2016 | continued
32. Financial risk management continued
c) Credit risk continued
Trade receivables with a carrying amount of £5,939,000 (2015: £5,854,000) are neither past due nor impaired . Trade 
receivables have no external credit rating as they relate to individual clients, although the value of investments held in each 
individual client’s portfolio is always in excess of the total value of the receivable . All trade receivables fall due within three 
months (2015: all) .
33. Capital management 
Capital is defined as the total of share capital, share premium, retained earnings and other reserves of the Company . Total 
capital at 30 June 2016 was £83,008,000 (2015: £74,164,000) . Regulatory capital is derived from the group Internal Capital 
Adequacy Assessment Process (ICAAP), which is a requirement of the Capital Requirements Directive . The ICAAP draws on 
the group’s risk management process which is embedded within the individual businesses, function heads and executive 
committees within the group .
The group’s objectives when managing capital are to comply with the capital requirements set by the Financial Conduct 
Authority, to safeguard the group’s ability to continue as a going concern so that it can continue to provide returns for 
shareholders and benefits for other stakeholders and to maintain a strong capital base to support the development of the 
business .
Capital adequacy and the use of regulatory capital are monitored daily by the group’s management . The group’s 2016 ICAAP 
was approved in August 2016 . There have been no capital requirement breaches during the year . Brooks Macdonald Group 
plc’s Pillar III disclosure is presented on our website at www . brooksmacdonald . com .
34. Guarantees and contingent liabilities
Brooks Macdonald Asset Management Limited, a subsidiary company of the group, has an agreement with the Royal Bank of 
Scotland plc to guarantee settlement for trading with CREST stock on behalf of clients . The group holds client assets to fund 
such trading activity .
Additional levies by the Financial Services Compensation Scheme may give rise to further obligations based on the group’s 
income in the current or previous years . Nevertheless, the ultimate cost to the group of these levies remains uncertain and is 
dependent upon future claims resulting from institutional failures .
35. Related party transactions
Certain directors have taken advantage of the group’s interest-free season ticket loan facility which is available to all 
employees . The directors who have such loans are as follows:

assets include an investment of 1,426,793 . 64 class B ordinary shares in Braemar Group PCC Limited Student Accommodation 
Cell (note 16) . Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss include an investment of 563,689 . 4025 class A units in the 
IFSL Brooks Macdonald Balanced Fund made during the year (note 20) . These transactions were conducted on an arm’s 
length basis at market value .
The group holds a 60% interest in North Row Capital LLP, a joint venture, details of which are given in note 17 .
36. Interest in unconsolidated structured entities 
Structured entities are those entities that have been designed so that voting or similar rights are not the dominant factor in 
deciding who has control, such as when any voting rights relate to administrative tasks only, or when the relevant activities 
are directed by means of contractual arrangements . The group’s interests in consolidated and unconsolidated structured 
entities are described below .
The only consolidated structured entity is the Employee Benefit Trust (‘EBT’), details of which are given in note 27 . 64  |  Brooks Macdonald Group plc  |  Annual Report and Accounts 2016
Notes to the consolidated financial statements
for the year ended 30 June 2016 | continued
36. Interest in unconsolidated structured entities  continued
The group has interests in structured entities as a result of contractual arrangements arising from the management of assets 
on behalf of its clients . Assets under management within the Funds and property management segment include those 
managed within structured entities . These structured entities consist of unitised vehicles such as Open Ended Investment 
Companies (OEICs) which entitle investors to a percentage of the vehicle’s net asset value . The structured entities are 
financed by the purchase of units or shares by investors . As fund manager, the group does not guarantee returns on its funds 
or commit to financially support its funds . Where external finance is raised, the group does not provide a guarantee for the 
repayment of any borrowings . The business activity of all structured entities, in which the group has an interest, is the 
management of assets in order to maximise investment returns for investors from capital appreciation and/or investment 
income . The group earns a management fee from its structured entities, based on a percentage of the entity’s net asset value . 
The main risk the group faces from its interest in FUM managed on behalf of external investors is the loss of fee income as a 
result of the withdrawal of funds by clients . Outflows from funds are dependent on market sentiment, asset performance and 
investor considerations . The assets under management of unconsolidated structured entities total £625m (2015: £398m) . 
Included in revenue on the consolidated statement of comprehensive income is management fee income of £3,027 ,000 
(2015: £1,980,000) from unconsolidated structured entities managed by the group . 
37 . Events since the end of the year
The group disposed of its entire holding of GLIF zero dividend preference shares in July 2016 for proceeds of £735,000, 
representing a total realised loss on disposal of £15,000 .
The sale of the underlying property portfolio of the Student Accommodation Fund completed on 1 July 2016 and the listing 
of the cell’s ordinary shares on the Channel Islands Securities Exchange was cancelled on 5 July 2016 . The final net asset 
value of the fund had not been determined at the date of signing these financial statements but is expected to available by the 
end of September 2016, with final payment of the redemption monies anticipated in October 2016 .   Brooks Macdonald Group plc  |  Annual Report and Accounts 2016  |  65

In our opinion, Brooks Macdonald 
Group plc’s parent company financial 
statements (the ‘financial statements’):
• give a true and fair view of the state 
of the parent company’s affairs as at 
30 June 2016 and of its cash flows 
for the year then ended;
• have been properly prepared in 
accordance with International 
Financial Reporting Standards 
(‘IFRSs’) as adopted by the European 
Union and as applied in accordance 
with the provisions of the 
Companies Act 2006; and
• have been prepared in accordance 
with the requirements of the 
Companies Act 2006 .
What we have audited
The financial statements, included 
within the Annual Report & Accounts 
(the ‘Annual Report’), comprise:

In applying the financial reporting

estimates, they have made 
assumptions and considered future 
events .
Opinion on other matter 
prescribed by the Companies 
Act 2006
In our opinion, the information given 
in the Strategic Report and the Report 
of the Directors for the financial year 
for which the financial statements are 
prepared is consistent with the 
financial statements .
Other matters on which we are 
required to report by exception
Adequacy of information and 
explanations received
Under the Companies Act 2006 we are 
required to report to you if, in our 
opinion:
• we have not received all the 
information and explanations we 
require for our audit; or
• adequate accounting records have 
not been kept by the parent 
company, or returns adequate for 
our audit have not been received 
from branches not visited by us; or
• the financial statements are not in 
agreement with the accounting 
records and returns .
We have no exceptions to report 
arising from this responsibility .
Directors’ remuneration

responsibility . 
Responsibilities for the 
financial statements and 
the audit
Our responsibilities and those  
of the directors
As explained more fully in the 
Statement of Directors’ 
Responsibilities set out on page 22, 
the directors are responsible for the 
preparation of the financial 
statements and for being satisfied that 
they give a true and fair view .
Our responsibility is to audit and 
express an opinion on the financial 
statements in accordance with 
applicable law and International 
Standards on Auditing (UK and 
Ireland) (‘ISAs (UK & Ireland)’) . Those 
standards require us to comply with 
the Auditing Practices Board’s Ethical 
Standards for Auditors .
This report, including the opinions, 
has been prepared for and only for the 
parent company’s members as a body 
in accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 
16 of the Companies Act 2006 and for 
no other purpose . We do not, in giving 
these opinions, accept or assume 
responsibility for any other purpose 
or to any other person to whom this 
report is shown or into whose hands it 
may come save where expressly 
agreed by our prior consent in writing .
What an audit of financial  statements 
involves
We conducted our audit in 
accordance with ISAs (UK & Ireland) . 
An audit involves obtaining evidence 
about the amounts and disclosures in 
the financial statements sufficient to

COMPANY STATEMENT OF FINANCIAL POSITION
AS AT 30 JUNE 2016
 
We primarily focus our work in these 
areas by assessing the directors’ 
judgements against available 
evidence, forming our own 
judgements, and evaluating the 
disclosures in the financial 
statements .
We test and examine information, 
using sampling and other auditing 
techniques, to the extent we consider 
necessary to provide a reasonable 
basis for us to draw conclusions . We 
obtain audit evidence through testing 
the effectiveness of controls, 
substantive procedures or a 
combination of both .
In addition, we read all the financial 
and non-financial information in the 
Annual Report to identify material 
inconsistencies with the audited 
financial statements and to identify 
any information that is apparently 
materially incorrect based on, or 
materially inconsistent with, the 
knowledge acquired by us in the 
course of performing the audit . If we 
become aware of any apparent 
material misstatements or 
inconsistencies we consider the 
implications for our report .
Other matter
We have reported separately on the 
group financial statements of Brooks 
Macdonald Group plc for the year 
ended 30 June 2016 .

company, incorporated and domiciled in the United Kingdom under the Companies Act 2006 and listed on AIM . The address 
of its registered office is 72 Welbeck Street, London, W1G 0AY .
Statement of compliance 
The individual financial statements of the Company are presented as required by the Companies Act 2006 and have been 
prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as adopted by the European Union . These 
are the Company’s first financial statements prepared in accordance with IFRS and IFRS 1 “First time adoption of 
International Financial Reporting Standards” has been applied . An explanation of how the transition to IFRS has affected the 
reported financial position, financial performance and cash flows of the Company is provided in note 53 .
Developments in reporting standards and interpretations 
Developments in reporting standards and interpretations are set out in note 2 to the consolidated financial statements . 
The principal accounting policies adopted are set out below:
a) Basis of preparation
The financial statements have been prepared on the historical cost basis, except for the revaluation of investments such that 
they are measured at their fair value .
At the time of approving the financial statements, the directors have a reasonable expectation that the Company has 
adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future . Accordingly, they continue to adopt the 
going concern basis in preparing the financial statements . As permitted by Section 408 of the Companies Act 2006, the 
company has elected not to present its own Statement of Comprehensive Income for the financial year .
b) Investments in subsidiary companies
Where the Company has investments in subsidiary companies; whereby one entity (the ‘subsidiary’) is controlled by another 
entity (the ‘parent’), the investments are stated at cost less, where appropriate, provision for impairment . The carrying values 
of investments in subsidiary companies are reviewed annually to determine whether any indicator of impairment exists .
c) Retirement benefit costs
Contributions in respect of the group’s defined contribution pension scheme are recognised in the Income Statement as they 
fall due .
d) Employee Benefit Trust
Where the Company holds its own equity shares through an Employee Benefit Trust these shares are shown as a reduction in 
shareholders’ equity . Any consideration paid or received for the purchase or sale of these shares is shown as a reduction in 
the reconciliation of movements in shareholders’ funds . No gain or loss is recognised in the Income Statement on the 
purchase, sale, issue or cancellation of these shares .
e) Other investments
Other quoted investments are designated as available for sale and re-valued each reporting period to their fair value 
according to the most recently available market information .
Accounting policies in relation to impairment, dividend income, interest income, operating leases, foreign currency, taxation, 
cash and cash equivalents and share based payments are set out in note 2 to the consolidated financial statements .

The Company holds investments of 1,426,793 . 64 class B ordinary shares, representing an interest of 10 . 88%, in Braemar 
Group PCC Limited Student Accommodation Cell (‘Student Accommodation Fund’); and 500,000 redeemable preference 
shares in an unlisted company incorporated in the UK .
The Student Accommodation Fund is promoted by Brooks Macdonald Funds Limited, a subsidiary of the Company . The 
shareholders of the fund approved a resolution in May 2016 to sell the underlying property portfolio of the fund to a third 
party . The shares will subsequently be compulsorily redeemed out of the remaining net assets of the fund following the sale, 
although this process had not been completed at 30 June 2016 . The Company has therefore estimated the fair value of the 
group’s investment at 30 June 2016 at £471,000 (2015: £782,000) based on the most recent information made available to 
investors about the consideration payable for the assets of the fund and the expected net asset value per share after adjusting 
for the costs associated with the sale . An impairment loss of £311,000 (2015: £718,000) was recognised in the Income 
Statement during the year, reflecting this perceived permanent diminution of value of the Company’s shareholding .
During the year, the Company acquired 500,000 redeemable preference shares in an unlisted company with a par value of £1 
at a cost of £500,000 . The preference shares are redeemable at par any time after five years from the date of issue (8 April 
2016) and bear an entitlement to a fixed preferential dividend of 8% per annum of the nominal value of the shares . The fair 
value of the preference shares has been estimated at £500,000 based on a discounted cash flow analysis .
An analysis of these financial instruments and the level within the fair value hierarchy into which they are categorised is 
provided within note 16 of the consolidated financial statements .

46. Deferred consideration
Deferred consideration is split between non-current liabilities and other payables within current liabilities (note 47) to the 
extent that it is due for payment within one year of the reporting date . It reflects the directors’ best estimate of amounts 
payable in the future in respect of certain client relationships and subsidiary undertakings that were acquired by the group . 
Deferred consideration is measured at its fair value based on discounted expected future cash flows . The amount outstanding 
at 30 June 2016 of £5,290,000 (2015: £9,442,000) related exclusively to amounts payable in respect of the acquisition of Levitas .

Long Term Incentive Scheme
The group established an Employee Benefit Trust (‘EBT’) on 3 December 2010 to acquire ordinary shares in the Company to 
satisfy awards under the group’s Long Term Incentive Scheme (‘LTIS’) and other share-based payment schemes (note 29) . All 
finance and administration expenses connected with the Trust are charged to the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive

As stated in note 38, these are the first set of financial statements prepared in accordance with IFRS . The accounting policies 
set out in note 38 have been applied in preparing the financial statements for the year ended 30 June 2016, the comparative 
information presented in these financial statements for the year ended 30 June 2015 and in preparation of an opening IFRS 
Statement of Financial Position at 30 June 2014 (the opening position on 1 July 2014, the date of the transition to IFRS) . In

Transitional arrangements 
IFRS 1 “First time adoption of International Financial Reporting Standards” permits companies adopting IFRS for the first time 
to take certain exemptions from the full requirements of IFRS in the transition period . The Company’s application of the 
optional exemptions is as follows:
Assets and Liabilities measured at the group’s transition date to IFRS
The company has taken advantage of the option given in IFRS 1 to measure its assets and liabilities at the carrying value 
amounts that were included in the group’s consolidated financial statements, based on the group’s transition to IFRS 
on 1 July 2006 .
Investments in subsidiaries 
The Company has elected to recognise all its investments in subsidiaries at their deemed cost, which was the carrying value 
under UK GAAP .
Other Investments 
The Company has elected to classify equity instruments with a carrying value at 1 July 2015 of £782,000 (2014: £1,432,000) 
as available for sale financial assets .
Key impacts of IFRS 
The significant differences between UK GAAP and IFRS which impact on the Company’s reported financial position, financial 
performance and cash flows are set below:
IAS1 and IAS 39 – Presentation of Financial Statements and Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement
The Statement of Financial Position and applicable notes have been amended to reflect the presentational disclosures 
required by IAS 1 and IAS 39 .
IAS 39 – Financial Instruments: recognition and measurement
In accordance with IAS 39, the Company has recognised gains or losses on revaluation of available for sale equity securities 
in other comprehensive income .
IAS12 – Income Taxes
IAS 12 requires that deferred tax on equity items is recognised directly in equity . UK GAAP requires that all such deferred tax 
is recognised in the Income Statement . In addition, deferred tax is recognised on available for sale assets under IAS12 . No 
such deferred tax is recognised under UK GAAP . Reported profit after tax for the year ended 30 June 2015 and for 30 June 
2014 has not changed because there was no deferred tax relating to the available for sale asset . Deferred tax assets are only 
recognised to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profit will be available against which the temporary differences 
can be utilised .
IAS 7 – Statement of cash flows 
The Company has prepared its Statement of Cash Flows in accordance with IAS 7 . Under IAS 7 , the Statement of Cash Flows 
shows the movement in cash and cash equivalents, being defined as cash in hand, demand deposits and short term highly 
liquid investments that are readily convertible to known amounts of cash and which are subject to an insignificant risk of 
change in value . Under UK GAAP, the Company was exempt from the requirement to prepare a Statement of Cash Flows . 78  |  Brooks Macdonald Group plc  |  Annual Report and Accounts 2016

Explanatory Notes
(i)  The results for the year ended 31 December 2005 represent the Group’s ﬁ rst full year ﬁ nancial statements prepared under  
International Financial Reporting Standards. As a consequence, the 2004 results have been amended accordingly. 
(ii)  Laird uses underlying results as key performance indicators. Underlying proﬁ t before tax and underlying earnings per share are stated before 
exceptional items, the amortisation of acquired intangible assets, deferred tax on acquired intangible assets and goodwill, the gain or loss on 
disposal of businesses and the impact arising from the fair valuing of ﬁ nancial instruments.
(iii)  The narrative that follows is based principally on underlying operating proﬁ t, proﬁ t before tax and earnings per share, as the directors believe 
that these provide a more consistent measure of operating performance.
(iv) The average number of shares in issue was 157.9 million in 2005 and 145.6 million in 2004. Chairman’s statement
Securing the future
a year of strategic growth
Strategy 
Laird has established a successful strategy of focusing on 
higher growth markets, obtaining a competitive edge through 
technology and customer service allied to a well established, 
but still expanding, low cost manufacturing base, currently in 
Asia and Central Europe and with the potential to be developed 
in Mexico and India. Laird’s strategy is to focus on specialist 
markets which provide opportunities for growth, while our global 
reach provides advantages compared to many of our more 
regional or local competitors. In line with this strategy Laird has 
expanded, and intends to continue to expand, the technology, 
market access, product offering and geographic spread of our 
divisions. The Laird strategy is one driven by the overriding 
objective of creating and growing shareholder value, today and in 
the future.
Delivery of Proﬁ table Growth
2005 saw further good progress made by the Group. We 
strengthened and developed both our market leading divisions, 
Laird Technologies and Laird Security Systems, during the year 
through organic investment and acquisitions, and continued our 
repositioning of the Group to higher growth markets. We have 
again delivered positive organic revenue growth together with 
good growth in underlying proﬁ ts and earnings. Group underlying 
proﬁ ts before tax were £55.1 million in 2005, up 19% on the 
£46.4 million reported in 2004. Earnings per share on a similar 
basis were 28.9 pence, up 10% on the 26.3 pence in 2004. 
Continuing Dividend Growth
The Board’s policy on dividends is to increase returns to 
shareholders progressively over time, reﬂ ecting both the 
underlying proﬁ tability of the Group and the cash ﬂ ow 
requirements of the business. Your Board is recommending a 
ﬁ nal dividend of 6.45 pence per share, payable to shareholders in 
respect of their shareholdings recorded on the register on 5 May 
2006. This will provide a total dividend for the year of 9.75 pence 
per share, compared with 9.2 pence per share for 2004 and 
represents an increase of 6%.
Board Development
David Morton, senior independent non-executive director, retired 
from the Board at the Annual General Meeting in May 2005. I 
would like to thank David for his valuable service and extensive 
contribution to the development of the Group. John McDowall 
has succeeded David Morton as the senior non-executive 
director of the Board.
Our Employees
Laird employs some 9,000 people of many different nationalities 
and cultures worldwide. The Group’s continuing progress and 
its further successful development during the year is a result 
of the hard work and dedication of these employees and the 
successes they have achieved. Their support and commitment 
underpins the service we provide to our customers, and is critical 
in furthering the growth and future success of the Group. I would 
like to take this opportunity, on behalf of the Board, to thank 
them all.
Corporate Social Responsibility
As a growing international Group, the Board believes that it is important 
for us to be good corporate citizens in the different locations and 
environments in which the Group operates. Our Group policies on 
ethics, on health, safety and the environment, and on employment 
are reinforced by a commitment to continuous improvement across 
our businesses. 2005 was a year of further progress 
in our overall performance in these areas. All of our 
main manufacturing facilities were accredited 
to the ISO 14001 standard, with its additional 
environmental requirements, during the course of 
the year , with the remaining recent acquisitions 
targeted to achieve accreditation during 2006. 
This is in addition to the majority of our main 
manufacturing facilities being ISO 9001 and 
9000 certiﬁ ed. We have seen beneﬁ ts of 
introducing these standards to our facilities 
and aim to reinforce these systems by 
completing the integration of the 
British Standards Occupational 
health and safety speciﬁ cation, 
OHSAS 18001, into each of 
our ISO 14001 registered 
sites during 2006. Further 
details of our activities in 
these areas are given 
in the Corporate 
Social Responsibility 
section of this 
Report.
Maintaining the 
Momentum of 
the Group
Laird has made 
further good 
progress in 2005, 
again delivering good 
growth in revenue and 
underlying proﬁ t. The strategic 
decisions which were made to 
focus the Group on its two high 
quality divisions, both of which 
have opportunities for growth, 
together with the investments 
that have been made to 
strengthen and develop each 
of them and to broaden their 
product and market spread, have 
again allowed the Group to move 
forward. The Group intends to 
continue to pursue and implement 
this strategy, and is well positioned 
to make further progress in 2006.

Strategic Development
Laird has made further good progress in 2005, and has again delivered 
positive organic revenue growth together with good growth in underlying 
proﬁ ts and earnings.  We have continued to strengthen and develop our 
two market leading divisions, with recent acquisitions performing at or 
ahead of expectations.  
Over the last ﬁ ve years the Group has been transformed from a 
diversiﬁ ed industrial conglomerate to a higher growth, increasingly 
proﬁ table company focused on its two market leading divisions. 
Lower growth, low margin businesses have been and, where 
appropriate will continue to be, divested. Laird 
T echnologies and Laird Security 
Systems have been and continue 
to be strengthened and expanded, 
both through organic investment and 
through acquisitions, which have 
enhanced the technology, product 
offering, market positioning and 
geographic spread of the Group.
Delivery of Proﬁ table Growth 
Total Group revenue in 2005 
was £508.7 million, 9% 
up on the £468.0 million 
of total revenue in 
2004. Revenue 
from continuing 
operations, that is 
including acquisitions 
but excluding the 
disposals made in 
2004 and 2005, 
was £490.3 million, 
up 42% on the 
£345.5 million in 
2004. Underlying 
organic revenue
growth from 
continuing operations 
was 7%.
Underlying proﬁ t before tax 
was £55.1 million in 2005, 
19% higher than £46.4 million 
in 2004. The Group’ s 
underlying operating proﬁ t 
margin increased to 12.9%, 
from 11.1% in 2004 as a 
result of organic growth, 
a greater proportion of 
manufacturing from low 
cost countries and the 
portfolio repositioning.
Proﬁ t before taxation from 
continuing operations, after 
exceptional items, the 
amortisation of acquired 
intangibles and the fair valuing 
of ﬁ nancial instruments, was £34.3 million in 2005, compared with 
£40.6 million in 2004.
Underlying earnings per share in 2005 were 28.9 pence, 10% up on 
the 26.3 pence in 2004.
Exceptional costs of £15.5 million were incurred in the year (2004: 
£nil). This was largely as a result of the restructuring of Laird 
T echnologies’ Swedish antennae operations and their relocation 
to Central Europe, and of Laird Security Systems’ UK window 
hardware business and the resultant relocation to China, all as 
originally planned, together with the effects of the Pennsylvania ﬂ ood 
in April 2005 and the £4.0 million lease provision made consequent 
upon the disposal of Permacell Finesse in September.
Net borrowings at the year end were £148.1 million (2004: 
£118.6 million), representing 52% of shareholders’ funds. Interest 
cover for the year was 6.2 times. There was a strong trading cash 
inﬂ ow in the year of £34.0 million, compared with an inﬂ ow of 
£24.3 million in 2004. There was a net cash outﬂ ow on acquisitions 
and disposals of £29.1 million compared with £77.3 million in 2004, 
additional contributions of £5.8 million in 2005 (2004: £nil) into the 
Group’ s deﬁ ned beneﬁ t pension schemes above the normal funding 
level of £1.9 million and a cash spend on exceptional items of 
£4.7 million compared with £2.6 million in 2004.
Beneﬁ ts of Strategic Acquisitions
Laird T echnologies made two acquisitions in 2005. Cateron, based 
in T aiwan and with a manufacturing facility in China, was acquired in 
January for approximately £13.0 million. Cateron, a leading supplier 
of EMI shielding products to the global PC notebook market, has 
performed ahead of expectations. The acquisition of Melcor, for 
approximately £11.0 million, was completed in October. Melcor, with 
facilities in New Jersey, USA and Quanzhou, China, designs and 
produces thermoelectric coolers, expanding Laird T echnologies’ 
existing thermal product range and broadening its served markets.
In May 2005 Laird Security Systems consolidated its position as 
the largest UK provider of composite doors to the growing social 
housing and Housing Association market with the acquisition of 
Securidor for approximately £6.0 million.  In September 2005 the 
acquisition of Builders Hardware in California, for approximately 
£6.0 million, provided Laird Security Systems with an expanded 
presence in the growing West Coast market and complements the 
existing door hardware product range in the USA.
Maintaining Progress
Laird has again made good progress in 2005, growing revenues 
and underlying proﬁ t.  The Group has continued to be developed 
strategically, and is well positioned to make further progress in 2006.

 The Laird Group PLC 5 6 The Laird Group PLC
Laird Technologies
Partners in Design
Laird Technologies is a leading 
international supplier of custom 
designed electronic components 
and solutions to the global 
electronics industries, including 
telecommunications infrastructure, 
cellular handsets, data transfer and 
information technology, and also 
supplies the automotive, aerospace 
and defence, consumer electronics, 
medical and industrial markets. 
Laird believes that Laird 
Technologies is the global market 
leader in the design and supply of both 
EMI shielding solutions and wireless 
cellular handset antennae; it also has 
an increasing presence in the emerging 
applications of telematics and Wi-Fi. 
Laird has also established a growing 
presence in the design and supply 
of thermal management products 
and solutions for electronic devices. 
Its products, often co-designed in 
conjunction with its customers, are 
critical in protecting or enhancing the 
performance of electronic devices. 
As leading global electronics 
manufacturers look to focus their 
internal processes around brand 
management and sales generation, 
they look increasingly to Laird 
Technologies to provide a more 
comprehensive suite of products, 
design engineering and testing, as well 
as integration with their global supply 
chain and research and development. 
Strong growth in revenues and 
proﬁ ts 
In markets that generally remained 
buoyant in 2005, Laird Technologies 
beneﬁ ted particularly from the strong 
demand for its EMI shielding and 
antennae products for the cellular 
handset market, where industry 
commentators believe that global 
unit handset shipments increased by 
approximately 20% compared with 
2004, to approximately 820 million 
units. 
Revenue grew by some 82% in the 
year to £259.4 million compared with 
£142.8 million in 2004. This strong 
growth in revenues was the result 
of acquisitions, most notably that of 
Centurion Wireless Technologies which 
was acquired in October 2004, and 
the organic revenue growth of 15% 
achieved in the year. 
EMI product line revenues were 
£135.0 million in 2005, with organic 
revenue growth of 16%. Antennae 
revenues were £103.0 million, with 
organic revenue growth of 36%, while 
revenues from the lower margin power 
products were £9.0 million, a decline 
of 58% organically as programmes 
became end-of-life and were not 
replaced. Thermal products revenues 
were £12.0 million in the year, with 
the business undergoing a period of 
consolidation. 
Underlying operating proﬁ ts also 
grew by some 82%, to £37.7 million, 
compared with £20.7 million in 2004, 
as a result of the organic revenue 
growth, the beneﬁ ts of acquisitions 
and the increased levels of production 
from lower cost countries. Operating 
margins were maintained, at 14.5%, 
despite the acquisition of Centurion’s 
lower margin businesses which have 
a higher “bought in” materials content 
compared to Laird Technologies’ EMI 
shielding and thermal products. 
Beneﬁ ts of strategic acquisitions 
Laird Technologies made two 
acquisitions in 2005. Cateron, based in 
Taiwan and with a manufacturing facility 
in China, was acquired in January for 
approximately £13.0 million and has 
performed ahead of expectations. 
Cateron is believed to be the leading 
supplier of EMI shielding, fabric over 
foam gaskets and tape to the global 
PC notebook market. Its strong 
position with Taiwanese Original Design 
Manufacturers has the potential to 
provide sales of antennae and thermal 
products and to provide a full service 
design and supply offering. 
The acquisition of Melcor, for 
approximately £11.0 million was 
completed in October 2005. Melcor 
has facilities in New Jersey, USA and 
Quanzhou, China. The Company 
designs and produces thermoelectric 
coolers, which actively transport 
thermal energy across a semiconductor 
junction coupled with electron ﬂ ow,

through technical expertise The Laird Group PLC 7 8 The Laird Group PLC
expanding Laird Technologies’ existing 
thermal product range and broadening 
its served markets. 
The acquisition of Antenex, Inc., 
for approximately £10.0 million was 
announced on 8 March 2006. Antenex, 
Inc. designs and manufactures a 
range of antennae products for 
communications in the transportation, 
defence, public safety, system and 
medical sectors, complementing 
Laird Technologies’ existing antennae 
product offering. 
Centurion Wireless Technologies, 
acquired in October 2004, also 
performed ahead of expectations. 
Cost synergies of $5.0 million in 
2006, announced at the time of the 
acquisition, are still expected to be 
achieved, while the ﬁ rst “synergy” 
sales have been made. Laird 
Technologies, including Centurion, 
shipped 170 million cellular antennae 
units, a growth of 23% compared with 
Centurion’s shipments in 2004, as a 
result of strong market demand and 
market share gains. Strong growth 
was also achieved in telematics and 
other wireless antennae shipments. 
In October 2005 Centurion reached a 
milestone with the shipping of its one 
billionth wireless handset antenna. 
Operational and geographic 
development 
Asia continues to be of increasing 
importance to Laird Technologies, 
both as a growing market and as a 
low cost manufacturing base, and is 
also becoming increasingly important 
as a design and development centre. 
In 2005, 50% of Laird Technologies’ 
revenues by destination were from Asia 
(2004: 45%) and 54% of revenues by 
origin (2004: 33%). At the end of 2005, 
Laird Technologies had approximately 
6,600 employees, of whom 75% were 
in Asia, the majority in China. 
In China, construction of a new 
35,000 square metre facility in 
Shenzhen was completed by the year 
end, and it is expected that the facility 
will become operational during the ﬁ rst 
half of 2006 focusing initially on EMI 
shielding products. A global production 
tooling centre for Laird Technologies is 
also being established there. 
Construction of a new 23,000 
square metre facility in Beijing for 
production of wireless handset 
antennae, and incorporating a major 
design centre, is well under way, and 
it is expected will be operational by 
June 2006. 
Further expansion in Tianjin will 
support growth in the production of 
shielding products for the wireless 
handset market, as well as thermally 
or electrically conductive elastomer 
(“ECE”) products and materials. It 
is expected from early 2006, the 
manufacture of ECE products for Asia 
will be relocated to Tianjin from the 
USA and Europe. Additional production 
space was secured in Shanghai 
to support the increased output of 
board level shields for the wireless 
handset market. 
Elsewhere in Asia, a new production 
facility was established in Johor Baru, 
Malaysia, to provide shielding products 
for wireless handsets. In Korea two 
facilities have been consolidated into 
a new facility in Seoul, to create a 
single design and sales support centre 
for all Laird Technologies’ products. 
In Taiwan, facility consolidation has 
taken place following the acquisition 
of Centurion and Cateron. Antennae 
design, prototyping and testing 
capabilities will be established in both 
Korea and Taiwan in 2006 to support 
local customers. 
In the USA, the EMI shielding plant in 
Pennsylvania closed by ﬂ ood damage 
in April 2005 was re-opened and order 
intake restored. Approximately 20% 
of the pre-ﬂ ood production has been 
relocated permanently to other Laird 
Technologies facilities, and the head 
count has reduced by approximately 
one third. A new ﬂ ood protection levee 
has been constructed on site. 
In Europe, the two UK facilities were 
consolidated into one, and the majority 
of UK manufacturing relocated to 
Liberec in the Czech Republic where 
production continues to be expanded. 
Liberec now supplies the majority of 
European EMI shielding products. 
Almost all antennae production from  The Laird Group PLC 9
Sweden has been relocated to 
Beijing, China and to a new facility 
in Szombathely, Hungary, to supply 
the Central European electronics 
manufacturing centres of Laird 
Technologies’ customers. 
A new facility is planned for 
Reynosa, Mexico during 2006, initially 
for antennae production but with 
the ability to expand to cover other 
products, and a feasibility study in 
2006 will assess the potential for a 
similar facility in India. 
Technical development 
During 2005 Laird T echnologies 
continued to expand and develop 
its technology capabilities with 
370 patents issued and 180 
pending and some 280 engineers 
and technologists were employed 
worldwide at the year end. 
New EMI shielding products under 
development or commercialised 
during 2005 included “Eco Green”, 
a fabric over foam product for the 
consumer electronics industry and the 
development of a range of mould-in 
place environmental gaskets. 
In antennae, Laird Technologies 
continues to develop new integrated 
antennae modules, including the 
ﬁ rst software controlled antennae, 
to cope with the increasing complex 
demands for multiple applications. 
New antennae products included an 
enhanced, ceramic based production 
line for non-cellular frequencies. 
A number of new thermal interface 
products including specialist 
thermally conductive greases, are 
being developed. In August, Laird 
Technologies’ T-Pli2000
®
 
series 
gap ﬁ ller was selected by NASA 
for use aboard the space shuttle 
Discovery. Following the acquisition 
of Melcor, a new range of enhanced 
thermoelectric coolers, to improve 
thermal and mechanical performance 
is planned. 
Extending global leadership 
Laird Technologies had another 
successful year in 2005. Its 
close customer relationships, its 
increasingly broad product offering, 
its expanding base of technical 
expertise and its well established, but 
still growing, low cost manufacturing 
base, is expected to provide a sound 
platform from which to extend further 
its global leadership positions 
during 2006. 10 The Laird Group PLC
Laird Security Systems
Innovative home improvement 
solutions 
Laird Security Systems is a leader in 
the design, development, manufacture 
and distribution of innovative products 
and solutions. These aim to improve 
performance and thermal efﬁ ciency, 
and enhance protection and security, 
for homes and buildings within the 
UK and USA residential building and 
home improvement markets. Its wide 
range of products include window 
and door hardware, composite doors, 
conservatories, uPVC products and 
weatherstripping seals. 
In recent years the product range 
has been broadened and the business 
is being repositioned towards the 
higher growth segments of its markets. 
Laird Security Systems sources an 
increasing proportion of its hardware 
products from its well established 
supply base in China, both from its 
own manufacturing facilities and from 
its partner suppliers. 
Beneﬁ ts of broad market spread 
Laird Security Systems’ markets 
were mixed in 2005. In the UK the 
overall housing market slowed, as 
did the renovation market, while the 
markets for replacement windows and 
conservatories were particularly hard 
hit. In contrast, the UK social housing 
market, where Laird Security Systems 
is a major supplier of composite doors, 
remained buoyant. 
In the USA, the market overall 
continued to be favourable across all 
of Laird Security Systems’ product 
lines. In particular the renovation 
market remained relatively buoyant, as 
geographically did the Southern US 
and West Coast markets overall. 
Laird Security Systems delivered 
a solid performance in 2005, with 
continuing revenue up 14% to 
£230.9 million in the year, compared 
with £202.7 million in 2004. Organic 
revenue growth was ﬂ at overall for Laird 
Security Systems as a whole, with a 
decline of 10% in the UK being offset 
by positive organic growth of 15% in 
the USA. 
UK revenue from continuing 
businesses in 2005 was approximately 
£131.0 million. Of this, 29% 
represented window hardware, 27% 
doors, 22% door hardware, and 12% 
windows and conservatories. 
USA revenue in 2005 was 
approximately £100.0 million. Of this, 
60% represented window hardware, 
18% seals, 12% door hardware and 
10% uPVC extrusions. 
Laird Security Systems was again 
able to show underlying proﬁ t growth, 
of 5%, despite its mixed markets and 
the adverse impact of commodity 
prices. Underlying operating proﬁ ts for 
2005 were £28.1 million, compared 
with £26.7 million in 2004. Operating 
margin for the year was 12%. 
Commodity prices remained volatile 
overall. Through carefully managing the 
relationship between input and output 
pricing, Laird Security Systems was 
able to contain the adverse effect of 
higher commodity prices in the year to 
some £1.0 million. 
Portfolio repositioning 
In May 2005, Laird Security Systems 
consolidated its position as the largest 
UK provider of composite doors to the 
growing social housing and Housing 
Association market with the acquisition 
of Securidor for approximately 
£6.0 million. This followed the 
acquisition of Intron in 2003 and 
Lindman in 2004 and increases further 
the product range offered to this 
growing market. 
In September 2005, the acquisition 
of Builders Hardware in California, for 
approximately £6.0 million, provided 
an expanded presence in the growing 
West Coast market and complements 
the existing door hardware product 
range in the USA. Proﬁ tability should be 
enhanced by re-sourcing the majority 
of Builders Hardware’s existing product 
lines to our and our partner suppliers’ 
operations in China. 
The acquisition of Builders Hardware 
was supplemented by the acquisition 
of Bandlock Corporation in March 
2006 for approximately £10.0 million. 
Bandlock Corporation is a California-
based seals and extrusion business, 
which will provide Laird Security 
Systems not only with the beneﬁ ts of 
Securing the future
through innovation The Laird Group PLC 11 12 The Laird Group PLC
a broader product offering close to 
customers on the US West Coast, but 
will also complement its existing US 
seals and extrusions businesses. 
Balance UK, acquired on 1 March 
2006, supplies a range of heavy duty 
window balances. This will enhance 
the product range of Laird’s US 
operations, to which Balance UK 
will report, allowing sales of these 
window balances to Laird’s existing 
US customers. 
The disposal of Permacell Finesse 
in the UK, an extruder of rigid 
uPVC window proﬁ les and cellular 
uPVC products, was completed 
in September 2005. Laird Security 
Systems had a relatively small market 
share in this business segment, 
which was also under signiﬁ cant price 
pressure as a result of high oil and 
resin prices. The business was facing 
increasingly difﬁ cult trading conditions, 
and recorded an operating loss in the 
year of £0.2 million through the point 
of sale. Following certain post closing 
adjustments, the net proceeds received 
were approximately £5.0 million. 
The effect of these acquisitions and 
the disposal has been to continue 
to reposition Laird Security Systems 
towards higher growth markets, 
particularly in the USA, in line with the 
Group’s strategy. It is expected that 
this overall strategy will continue to be 
pursued. 
Operational and geographic 
development 
In response to market conditions, 
headcount in the UK window hardware 
and components businesses was 
reduced by some 300 during the year, 
or some 35% of the combined total in 
these businesses. The hardware facility 
in Essex was downsized signiﬁ cantly, 
with the majority of manufacturing 
being re-sourced to China. At Laird 
Lifestyle Products, manufacturing 
operations were consolidated further, 
to improve efﬁ ciencies and provide a 
greater emphasis on marketing and 
product positioning. 
In the UK composite door 
business, the three sites resulting 
from acquisitions in this sector will be 
consolidated into two in the ﬁ rst half 
of 2006, with a capacity expansion 
at one of the facilities scheduled for 
completion at the end of the ﬁ rst 
quarter of 2006. These actions, 
together with Laird Security Systems’ 
technical capabilities and broad 
product range, should leave this 
business well placed to take advantage 
of the continuing market growth 
expected in this sector. 
In the USA, the window hardware, 
door hardware, weather seals and 
uPVC extrusions businesses each 
had an excellent year, with each 
product line showing good growth. 
The capacity expansion at the seals 
business in the North Eastern US, 
which was commenced in 2004, 
became fully operational in 2005. In 
2006, capacity of door hardware in 
the Mid Western US, and of window 
hardware in the South Eastern US, will 
be expanded to allow Laird to service 
increasing demand from customers. 
Laird Security Systems in the 
USA is beneﬁ ting from the growing 
renovation and improvement market, 
through favourable product trends in 
its main market segments, and through 
market share gains, both directly and 
through the continuing consolidation 
of its customer base. Laird Security 
Systems’ design capabilities and its 
high levels of customer service remain 
key to its success in North America. 
In Asia, sales of products 
manufactured in Asia grew by 
approximately 15% in 2005. The 
facilities in Ningbo, China, were 
expanded during the year. Sourcing 
from partner suppliers was also 
expanded; these suppliers are 
integrated into Laird Security Systems’ 
supply chain, which provides them 
with engineering expertise, specialised 
investment and quality control.  The Laird Group PLC 13
Innovation 
Laird Security Systems maintained 
its focus on product innovation and 
development, continuing to develop 
its intellectual property portfolio, 
while acting aggressively to defend 
successfully a number of attempted 
patent infringements. There were sales 
in 2005 from the new Springback 
sealing product range, innovative 
new window balance designs, and an 
increasing range of multipoint locks, all 
developed since 2003. Laird Security 
Systems continues with its product 
innovation and new designs, both to 
differentiate itself from its competitors 
and to provide enhanced functionality 
for its customers.
 Design teams in the UK and the 
USA are being integrated with the 
engineering, tooling and prototyping 
capabilities that are now ﬁ rmly 
established in Asia. As a result of this 
initiative, an innovative new range of 
window hardware products will be 
introduced into the US market during 
2006 and 2007. 
Laird Security Systems is targeting 
its product development to beneﬁ t 
from three macro trends which it sees 
emerging over the next few years. 
One is more demanding construction 
standards in North America, to reduce 
hurricane damage. A second is 
higher security allied to ease of use, 
including electronic access controls, 
which is seen to be particularly 
applicable as demographic trends 
move towards an increasingly 
ageing population. A third is the 
expected trend towards even greater 
insulation and thermal efﬁ ciency, as 
governments and consumers adjust 
to higher energy prices. 
Development of the strategy 
Laird Security Systems has continued 
to provide innovative local solutions 
to its customers allied to what are 
believed to be industry leading 
service levels on a global basis, 
underpinned by a still expanding low 
cost engineering and manufacturing 
capability in Asia. Within the division 
there is now a much broader presence 
in a range of markets, products and 
sales channels, allowing the division to 
continue its record of proﬁ table growth 
despite increased commodity prices 
and some weaker market sectors. 
Laird Security Systems is reducing its 
exposure to the mature UK window 
market and continuing its repositioning 
to higher growth markets, particularly in 
North America.  14 The Laird Group PLC
Finance Director’s report
International Financial Reporting 
Standards
The 2005 results have been reported 
using IFRS accounting policies. 
Revenue 
Total revenue increased from 
£468.0 million to £508.7 million in 
2005. Revenue from continuing 
operations increased from 
£345.5 million in 2004 to £490.3 million 
in 2005. Revenue from continuing 
operations increased by 42%. 
Revenue from discontinued 
operations in 2004 was £122.5 million 
and includes £91.9 million of revenue 
from Laird Plastics, which was divested 
in October 2004 and £30.6 million of 
revenue from Permacell Finesse (PFL) 
which was divested in September 
2005. Revenue from PFL in 2005 
up to the date of its disposal was 
£18.4 million. 
Organic growth from continuing 
operations was 7% and is measured 
by restating 2005 revenue at 2004 
exchange rates and comparing it 
to revenue in 2004 after including 
revenue in 2004 for the acquired 
businesses in the equivalent period 
not in our ownership. Laird Lifestyle 
Products revenue is excluded from 
the calculation as it was purchased 
from the Receiver in September 2004 
and was subsequently restructured 
signiﬁ cantly with a number of product 
lines being discontinued. 
Proﬁ t before tax 
Proﬁ t before tax, from continuing 
operations, was £34.3 million 
(2004, £40.6 million). The loss 
from discontinued operations was 
£5.1 million (2004, proﬁ t £7.0 million). 
Underlying proﬁ t before tax in 
the year was £55.1 million (2004, 
£46.4 million). Underlying proﬁ t is 
deﬁ ned as proﬁ t before tax, exceptional 
items, amortisation of acquired 
intangible assets, the gain or loss on 
sale of businesses and the impact 
arising from the fair valuing of ﬁ nancial 
instruments as set out in note 14. 
Under the Group’s IFRS accounting 
policies, certain development costs 
(£2.4 million) have been capitalised 
and these are partly offset by a charge 
(£0.8 million) made for share based 
payments. The net impact is that 
underlying proﬁ ts in the year on an 
IFRS basis are £1.6 million higher than 
they would have been under UK GAAP . 
Finance costs 
Finance costs, net of a fair value 
adjustment of £1.1 million, were 
£10.5 million compared to the 
£5.6 million in 2004, the increase due 
largely to the funding costs of the 
acquisitions and to higher US dollar 
interest rates. 
Taxation 
The tax charge is equivalent to 
an average tax rate of 17.3% on 
underlying proﬁ t before tax and is 
marginally higher than the 17.2% for 
2004. Proﬁ ts in the USA are subject 
to a relatively low charge and should 
remain so for many years due to tax 
deductions for amortised goodwill 
resulting from acquisitions in past 
years. A growing proportion of proﬁ ts 
are also from jurisdictions with low 
tax rates or with tax incentives. An 
analysis of the total tax charge is given 
in note 11. 
Underlying Earnings 
Underlying proﬁ t before tax was 19% 
up on 2004 and with more shares in 
issue, underlying earnings per share 
were up by 10% (note 14). Underlying 
earnings are based on underlying 
proﬁ t less underlying tax and exclude 
deferred tax on acquired intangible 
assets and goodwill.  The Laird Group PLC 15

* after adjusting for accruals on exceptional items

An increase in trade debtors has 
contributed to the rise in working 
capital due in part to higher levels of 
activity but also due to the increasing 
proportion of the Group’s revenues 
generated in Asia where terms of 
payment are longer. In addition, some 
of the increase in working capital arose 
at PFL which was sold part of the 
way through the year when working 
capital levels were higher than would 
be expected to be the case at the 
year end. 
Capital expenditure of £17.1 million 
was £4.3 million in excess of 
depreciation largely due to expansions 
in capacity to meet demand, with 
much of the excess occurring in Asia, 
and in particular in plants supplying 
products in China for the cellular 
handset markets. 
Cash tax payments were lower 
than the tax charge due largely to tax 
repayments in respect of previous 
years. 
Overall, there was a £29.5 million 
increase in net borrowings as the 
trading cash surplus was more than 
offset by dividend payments, the net 
spend on acquisitions and disposals 
and by translation movements following 
the strengthening of the US dollar. 
Net borrowings and debt facilities 
Net borrowings at the year end 
increased by £29.5 million compared to 
2004, to £148.1 million. As much of the 
Group’s borrowings are in US dollars 
and the US dollar has strengthened 
since the end of 2004, £12.5 million of 
the increase is due to the translation of 
borrowings using the US dollar rate at 
the end of December 2005. 
In August 2005, the Group replaced 
£165 million of bilateral loan facilities 
which were due to expire in 2008 with 
new committed facilities of £195 million 
which will expire in 2010. These new 
facilities, together with the Group’s 
US dollar private placement facilities 
which generally expire between 
2008 and 2016, provide the Group 
with committed facilities totaling 
£309 million. 
Currency 
The Group’s revenue and proﬁ ts are 
affected by currency movements 
on translating overseas revenue 
and proﬁ ts into Sterling for reporting 
purposes. The actual translation effects 
on cross border transactions which 
involve the sale of goods or services in 
currencies foreign to a Group entity are 
not signiﬁ cant taking into account that 
a number of currencies are pegged to 
the US dollar. 
The average exchange rates during 
the year for the US dollar were 1.82 
(2004, 1.83), 1.46 for the Euro (2004, 
1.48) and 14.90 for the RMB (2004, 
15.18). Average exchange rates in 
2005 were not signiﬁ cantly different 
to 2004 so there was little impact on 
proﬁ ts. 
The difference in year end exchange 
rates between 2004 and 2005 for 
the US dollar and the RMB was more 
marked with the closing rate for the 
US dollar in 2005 at 1.72 (2004, 1.92) 
and for the RMB 13.85 (2004, 15.89). 
The majority of the Group’s assets are 
held overseas and these are hedged 
in part by foreign currency loans. 
Due regard is given to the adequacy 
of the capitalisation levels of foreign 
subsidiaries and tax considerations 
in order to obtain relief for interest 
charges. The translation impact of 
exchange rate movements at the end 
of 2005 compared with the end of 
2004 increased shareholders’ funds by 
£21.7 million. 
Pensions 
The Group’s deﬁ ned beneﬁ t pension 
schemes’ deﬁ cit has increased from 
£14.8 million at the beginning of 
the year to £16.4 million at the end 
of the year. Asset values increased 
by £4.5 million over and above the 
returns on assets of £4.3 million 
assumed in the charge to the 
Income Statement and £5.8 million 
of additional contributions above the 
normal contribution level were paid in. 
However, these were more than offset 
by changes in the assumptions used 
to calculate liabilities; the bond rate 
used to discount liabilities was reduced 
from 5.4% in 2004 to 4.75%, adding 
£9.3 million to liabilities and more 
conservative mortality assumptions 
were adopted in moving to the 
“medium cohort” which added a further 
£4.6 million to liabilities. 
Shareholders’ Funds 
Shareholders’ funds at the 2005 
year end were £284.3 million 
(2004, £260.2 million). Proﬁ t 
attributable to equity shareholders 
was £20.2 million to which must be 
added exchange gains on translation of 
overseas assets but to which must be 
deducted dividend paid of £14.9 million 
and an actuarial increase in the net 
pension liabilities of £7.9 million.

US citizen. The Laird Group Public Limited Company is a holding company. The principal activities of its subsidiary undertakings (“subsidiaries”) 
during the year were the design, manufacture and supply of products and services to the electronics and the residential building 
industries. The Chairman’s statement, Chief Executive’s review and Finance Director’s report should be read in conjunction with this 
report. An analysis of revenue, profit, assets and liabilities by segment is shown in note 3 on pages 46 and 47.
Results and dividend
The Group profit for the year after taxation was £20.2 million (2004, £37.2 million). Underlying profit before tax was £55.1 million, (2004, 
£46.4 million) and is analysed in note 14 on page 53. The recommended final dividend is 6.45p per ordinary share to be paid on 2 June 
2006 to ordinary shareholders registered as members of the Company at the close of business on 5 May 2006 making a total dividend 
for the year of 9.75p per ordinary share. 
Allotment of new shares and exercise of options
In the year to 31 December 2005, the issued share capital of the Company was increased by the issue of 1,853,417 ordinary shares. 
1,781,000 Ordinary shares were issued following the exercise of options under the Company’s 1994 and 2003 executive share option 
schemes and 72,417 ordinary shares were issued on 15 December 2005 as part release of escrow shares arising from the acquisition of 
Centurion Wireless Technologies Inc in 2004. Details of the share capital and of options outstanding at 31 December 2005 are shown in 
note 29 on pages 66 and 67.
Directors
Re-election of directors 
The directors as shown on pages 16 and 17 were all directors throughout the year to 31 December 2005. Mr D Morton retired as a 
director on 13 May 2005. In accordance with the Combined Code on Corporate Governance which requires any non-executive director 
serving longer than nine years on the Board to be subject to annual re-election, Mr N J Keen will offer himself for re-election at the 
Annual General Meeting. Mr Keen fulfilled the criteria for independence as set out in the Combined Code at the time of his appointment 
and the Board is satisfied that Mr Keen remains free from any relationship with the executive management of the Company which could 
materially interfere with the exercise of his independent judgement. The Board believes that Mr Keen makes a valuable contribution 
to the Group. During his Chairmanship, Mr Keen has overseen the restructuring of The Laird Group PLC and the strengthening and 
development of the Board. The Board wishes him to continue as Chairman because of his wide experience of business, particularly in 
the high technology area and his long-standing financial experience. Messrs G Drabble, P J Hill, J B McDowall and A J Reading will 
retire by rotation and, being eligible, will offer themselves for re-election. Mr McDowall, aged 63, was appointed to the Board in 1998. 
He is the senior independent non-executive director, a member of the Audit Committee and a member (and former Chairman) of the 
Remuneration Committee. Mr McDowall’s business expertise and manufacturing knowledge are of benefit to the Board. Mr Reading, 
aged 62, was appointed to the Board in 2004. He is Chairman of the Remuneration Committee and a member for the Nominations 
Committee. Mr Reading has an excellent track record in international business, particularly in the USA, and the Company benefits from 
his general management experience and vision. The Articles of Association require any director who has attained the age of seventy to 
seek annual re-election, and accordingly Sir Geoffrey Owen will retire in accordance with Article 138 and will offer himself for re-election 
at the Annual General Meeting. The Board believes that Sir Geoffrey makes a valuable contribution, in particular his experience in global 
economic issues and knowledge of industrial and corporate matters provides an important perspective and a useful balance to the 
Board. It therefore wishes him to continue as a director. None of the non-executive directors offering themselves for re-election has a 
service contract with the Company or any of its subsidiaries. The executive directors offering themselves for re-election have service 
contracts with the Company which are terminable on twelve months notice. 
Directors’ interests 
No director had, in the year to 31 December 2005, a material interest in any third party contract of significance with the Company or any 
of its subsidiaries. Directors’ shareholdings at 31 December 2005 are shown below. These interests were unchanged at 15 March 2006.

Directors’ report 
for the year to 31 December 2005
18 The Laird Group PLC Employment policy
The Group is organised on a decentralised basis with directors of subsidiary companies responsible for developing employment policies 
appropriate to the size, organisation and location of their businesses. The Group is committed to providing equal opportunities in terms 
of recruitment, training and career development of all employees, including those with disabilities. Subsidiaries are encouraged to make 
all employees aware of the financial and economic factors affecting the performance of their companies.
A copy of the Group’s Employment policy statement is available on the Company’s website or on request from the Company.
Employee participation
The Board recognises that the success of the business relies on the skill and dedication of its employees and therefore encourages two-
way communication. Operating subsidiaries encourage consultation at local level and performance and development reviews reinforce 
the link between business goals, an employee’s contribution and his/her remuneration. An employee newsletter is circulated to all Group 
companies electronically and includes information on key events within the Group, charity and community involvement and employee 
achievements.
Corporate social responsibility
In recognition that the Group’s businesses and its activities involve a wide community of stakeholders including investors, employees, 
customers, suppliers and local communities, the Board regularly reviews the significance of social, environmental and ethical matters 
which may affect the Group. A Corporate social responsibility report providing further detail can be found on pages 24 and 25.
Health and safety at work
The Group is committed to providing a safe working environment for its employees and continuous improvement is sought by the setting 
of objectives and targets based on relevant national and international health and safety standards and monitoring performance against 
these. In addition the Group maintains a proactive communications strategy amongst all employees to promote and develop good health 
and safety practices.
Research and development
In recognition of the importance of investing in research and development programmes to foster product innovation and manufacturing 
improvements in the Group, expenditure in 2005 on research and development amounted to £16.0 million (2004, £7.7 million), of which 
£2.6 million has been capitalised (2004, £nil).
Basis of preparation of the accounts
As set out in the statement of directors’ responsibilities on page 33, the accounts have been prepared on a going concern basis. A 
statement on going concern relating to a business requires judgement at a point in time about future events which by their nature are 
inherently uncertain. The directors have a reasonable expectation that the Company and the Group have adequate resources to continue 
in operational existence for the foreseeable future. For this reason, they continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the 
accounts.
Financial assets and liabilities
An analysis of Group debt is given in note 22 to the financial statements. An analysis of financial instruments at carrying value and fair 
value is given in note 28 to the financial statements. Financial instruments and related disclosures together with a discussion of derivative 
financial instruments and disclosure about market risk are in accordance with IAS 32 and IAS 39.
Supplier payment policy
The Group requires its subsidiaries to negotiate clear and satisfactory arrangements for the payment of suppliers, as part of the overall 
terms and conditions of the supply, and to make payment accordingly. At the year end there were 53 days of purchases outstanding for 
the Group’s UK subsidiaries (2004, 53 days).
Directors’ Indemnities
During the year, two of the Laird Group’s final salary pension schemes were merged and the trustees of the schemes, including Mr Keen 
who is Chairman of the trustees of one of the schemes merged, received an indemnity from the Company against any claim or other 
liability arising out of or in connection with the pension schemes and their agreement to the merger.
Auditors
It is recommended that Ernst & Young LLP be reappointed as auditors.
Shareholders
At 31 December 2005 there were 4,133 shareholders.

Substantial equity interests
Pursuant to the requirements of section 198 of the Companies Act 1985, as at 14 March 2006 the Company had received the 
notifications of beneficial interests of 3% or more in the Company’s issued share capital as set out below. The requirements of section 
198 of the Companies Act specify that notifications of holdings of over 3% only have to be made when a full percentage point increase 
or decrease in the beneficial interest occurs, and that there is no notification requirement in respect of holdings of less than 3% in 
individual unit trusts even where the aggregation of these holdings amounts to a beneficial interest in excess of 3%. There is also no 
notification requirement in respect of discretionary management of shares without a beneficial interest. However, when the total holding 
of material and non-material interests exceeds 10% of the Company’s issued share capital, there is an obligation of disclosure with 
respect to the full shareholding.

Directors’ report (continued)
for the year to 31 December 2005 The Laird Group PLC 21
The Board considered that during the year ended 31 December 2005 the Company was in compliance with all of the provisions of 
section 1 (Companies) of the Combined Code on Corporate Governance.
The Board
The responsibilities and objectives of the Board
The Board is appointed by the shareholders who are the owners of the Company. The Board’s principal responsibility is to act in the 
best interests of the shareholders as a whole within the legal framework of the Companies Act 1985. The Board establishes the aims 
and objectives for the Company, approves the strategic direction and plans and the operating budgets proposed by the Chief Executive, 
and monitors performance against them. The Board is also responsible for identifying, evaluating and managing the key risks faced 
by the Company, for exercising proper and appropriate corporate governance, for establishing and ensuring the effectiveness of the 
Company’s systems of internal control and reviewing management performance. Through the Chief Executive, the Board has regard to 
the necessary financial and human resources required to meet the Company’s objectives.
The composition of the Board
The composition of the Board is outlined on pages 16 and 17. The Board comprises an appropriate mix of executive and non-executive 
directors and is of a size and includes the skills and experience appropriate for the requirements of the business. There is a clear written 
division of responsibility between the Chairman and the Chief Executive which has been agreed by the Board. Mr McDowall is the senior 
independent non-executive director, having taken over from Mr Morton who retired on 13 May 2005 at the Annual General Meeting. The 
principal role of the senior independent non-executive director is to be available to shareholders if they have concerns which have not 
been resolved through the normal channels of Chairman or Chief Executive. During the year the major shareholders were offered the 
opportunity to meet with the senior non-executive director. 
All the non-executive directors are considered by the Board to be independent. Nigel Keen, the Chairman, was appointed to the Board 
as an independent non-executive director in 1993. Mr Keen fulfilled the criteria for independence as set out in the Combined Code at 
the time of his appointment and the Board is satisfied that Mr Keen remains free from any relationship with the executive management of 
the Company which could materially interfere with the exercise of his independent judgement. The terms and conditions of appointment 
of the non-executive directors are available from the Company on request and will be on display at the Annual General Meeting. At the 
Annual General Meeting every year at least one third of the directors retire from office. Such rotation of directors ensures that directors 
submit themselves for re-election regularly, and at least every three years.
The operation of the Board
The Board meets at least eight times a year. A schedule of meetings and principal matters to be discussed is set out at least twelve 
months in advance. The Board also delegates certain of its responsibilities to Committees which are described below. The Board 
determines the membership and Chairmanship of the Committees. Minutes of those Committee meetings are circulated to Board 
Members prior to each Board Meeting. All directors receive Board Papers prior to the Meetings which include detailed financial 
information and a comprehensive operational overview from the Chief Executive. The Chairman and the non-executive directors meet 
at least twice a year without the executive directors present and the senior independent director meets at least annually with the 
non-executive directors without the Chairman present.
There is a schedule of key operational matters reserved for Board approval, including for example significant long term obligations 
such as capital investments, acquisitions and divestments above certain levels, the raising of new capital and the entering into of loan 
agreements. The Board delegates the day-to-day management of the business to the Chief Executive.
Communications with shareholders
The Laird Group, within the limits imposed by the Listing Rules, enters into a dialogue with institutional shareholders to develop an 
understanding of their views and to communicate and explain the Company’s objectives. The Chief Executive and Finance Director 
meet regularly with shareholders and report to the Board following these meetings. The Company’s stockbroker periodically contacts 
shareholders and provides feedback which is reported to the Board. In 2003 a formal survey, on a non-attributable basis, covering 
eighteen of the Company’s larger shareholders was commissioned and it is intended that another formal survey will be carried out in 
2006. Following presentations to analysts and major shareholders of the interim and full year results, confidential exit polls are conducted 
by outside consultants and the results are reported to the Board. The Chairman and the senior independent non-executive director make 
themselves available for meetings with shareholders. 
The Board views the Annual General Meeting as an opportunity to communicate with private investors and institutional shareholders 
and encourages them to attend. Shareholders are invited to ask questions and are given the opportunity to meet the directors informally 
after the meeting. The Chairman gives a formal report on the Company’s progress at the meeting. The chairmen of the various Board 
Committees are available to answer questions relating to their areas of responsibility. The number of proxy votes cast for, against or in 
abstention on the resolutions are reported to the meeting and, following the meeting, they are published on the Company’s website. 
Copies of all the Company’s press announcements are posted on the Company’s website.
Committees of the Board
The written Terms of Reference of the Committees are available on the Company’s website, from the Company on request and will be on 
display at the Annual General Meeting.

for the year to 31 December 2005 22 The Laird Group PLC
Audit Committee
Mr A M Robb was appointed Chairman of the Audit Committee in September 2004. The other members of the Committee are Mr J B 
McDowall and Sir Geoffrey Owen. The Board ensures that at least one member has recent and relevant financial experience, currently Mr 
Robb. The Audit Committee, which meets at least four times a year, is responsible for monitoring the integrity of the financial statements of 
the Company which are relied upon by the Board. The Committee reviews The Laird Group PLC’s financial statements prior to publishing 
with particular reference to significant financial reporting issues and judgements. The Committee oversees the internal audit function and 
also has responsibility for reviewing the internal financial controls. It considers the scope and planning of internal and external financial 
audits and the findings of those audits. The Chairman of the Board, the Chief Executive, the Finance Director and the external auditors 
are given notice of all meetings and may be invited to attend and speak at any meeting. The Committee considers the appointment and 
terms of engagement of the external auditor and assesses the independence of the external auditors and reviews the auditors’ policy for 
the rotation of audit partners. The Committee assesses annually the effectiveness of the audit process, including a report on the audit 
firm’s own internal quality control procedures. The Committee also agrees the audit fee and recommends for Board approval a policy 
for non-audit services so as to ensure that the provision of non-audit services does not impair the external auditors’ independence or 
objectivity. Where there are sound commercial and practical reasons, Ernst & Young provide non-audit services. For example, during the 
year Ernst & Young provided tax planning and compliance advice and undertook financial due diligence and regulatory compliance work. 
Where applicable, competitive quotes are obtained. Details of fees for non-audit work are set out in note 6 on page 48. The Committee 
recommends to the shareholders, through the Board, the election of the external auditors at the Annual General Meeting and the authority 
for the fixing of their remuneration. The Committee and the auditors meet formally without any executive directors present at least once a 
year. 
Nominations Committee
The Nominations Committee consists of the Chairman and at least two non-executive directors. It is chaired by Mr N J Keen and 
currently comprises Mr A J Reading and Mr J B McDowall. The Committee, in consultation with the Chief Executive, regularly reviews 
the structure, size and composition (including the balance of skills, knowledge and experience) required of the Board and makes 
recommendations to the Board with regard to any changes. At least annually the Committee reviews the performance of the Chief 
Executive and reports to the Board. It is responsible for nominating, for the approval of the Board, candidates for appointment to the 
Board having regard to the overall skills balance and composition of the Board. It reviews and advises upon succession planning and 
takes into account the need to refresh the Board ensuring that changes to the Board’s composition can be managed without undue 
disruption. The Committee is assisted by external search consultancies in identifying suitable candidates. 
Remuneration Committee
The Remuneration Committee, was chaired by Mr J B McDowall until the 2005 Annual General Meeting when he became the senior 
independent non-executive director and he was succeeded as Chairman of the Remuneration Committee by Mr A J Reading. 
Currently comprising the Chairman, Mr N J Keen, and all the non-executive directors, it met three times in 2005 and is responsible 
for recommending to the Board the Company’s general policy on remuneration and in particular to determine the remuneration and 
benefits of the executive directors and the grant of all options and award of shares under the Company’s Long Term Incentive Scheme. 
In accordance with the Terms of Reference of the Remuneration Committee, the Chairman of the Board shall not be the chairman of the 
Committee. The Remuneration Committee, excluding the Chairman, determines the remuneration of the Chairman and the terms of his 
appointment. The Board therefore believes the Company complies with the Combined Code recommendation regarding the composition 
of the Remuneration Committee.
The Chief Executive is given notice of all meetings and, at the request of the Chairman of the Committee, attends the meetings. In 
normal circumstances, the Chief Executive is consulted on general policy matters and matters concerning the other executive directors 
and employees. Further details on the Remuneration Committee are to be found in the Directors’ remuneration report on page 26. 
Administration Committee
The Administration Committee of the Board consists of any two or more directors and deals with items of a routine and administrative 
nature. 
Performance of the Board
During the last twelve months the Board has conducted a self-evaluation assessment of itself and its committees. Following completion 
of questionnaires by all directors, the Chairman led discussions to consider the Board’s “behaviours” and “processes”. Certain 
areas were identified for improvement or action. The Audit, Remuneration and Nominations Committees also considered their own 
performance and reported to the Board thereon. The performance of individual directors has been considered by the Chairman and 
Chief Executive in discussion with other non-executive directors. The non-executive directors have considered the performance of the 
Chairman, taking into account the views of the executive directors. The Chairman and Chief Executive have considered the performance 
of the executive directors. 
Board attendance
The Board had eight meetings during 2005. During the year Mr McDowall was unable to attend one meeting and Mr Morton was unable 
to attend three meetings. Whenever a director is unable to attend a meeting, the director, if possible, consults with the Chairman prior to 
the Meeting and is briefed by the Chairman after the Meeting.
There were eight Audit Committee meetings during the year; Mr McDowall was unable to attend two of those meetings. Three meetings 
of the Remuneration Committee were held. Mr Keen was unable to attend one meeting and Mr Morton was unable to attend two 
meetings. One meeting of the Nominations Committee was held, at which there was full attendance.
Corporate governance report (continued)
for the year to 31 December 2005 Internal control
The Laird Group PLC is a holding company registered in the UK with businesses located overseas as well as in the UK. These activities 
are organised as subsidiary companies where the directors and managers of these companies are appointed to manage within the 
framework established by The Laird Group Board, as well as complying with local statutory and regulatory requirements. Overall 
responsibility for the Group’s systems of internal control and reviewing their effectiveness lies with The Laird Group Board. Primary 
responsibility for systems of internal control rests with the directors of the subsidiaries. The Group’s executive directors are responsible 
for implementing Group policy and for monitoring the businesses and performance of subsidiary companies and reporting to the Board 
thereon. 
An ongoing process for identifying, evaluating and managing the significant risks faced by the Group is in place and complies with 
the guidance of the Turnbull Committee on internal control and is regularly reviewed by the Board. This process has been in place for 
the full financial year and up to the date the accounts were approved by the Board. Acquisitions during that period were subject to 
due diligence prior to their purchase and are required to adopt the Group’s procedures thereafter. The systems of internal control are 
designed to manage rather than eliminate the risk of failure to achieve business objectives as well as safeguarding the Group’s assets. 
These systems can only provide reasonable but not absolute assurance against material misstatement or loss.
Group operating rules are issued each year to the directors of subsidiary companies setting out their responsibilities and the procedures 
to be followed to agree their commercial and financial objectives. These rules require approval for specific transactions and call for 
accurate and relevant financial information to be delivered on a timely basis. The ability to identify risk is enhanced by the timely reporting 
of management information and the short lines of communication with operating managers.
Subsidiaries submit their budgets annually to the Group’s executive directors. As part of this process they are required to identify the 
key risks and opportunities that their businesses face and set out the strategies they will employ to manage the risks and exploit the 
opportunities. The issues raised by the subsidiaries are reviewed by the Board. This process is supplemented by papers submitted to 
the Board by the executive directors throughout the year and by meetings from time to time between the Board and the management 
of the subsidiaries, some of which take place at the premises of the operating companies. The Chief Executive presents the Group’s 
business objectives which are approved by the Board, and the Board also addresses those risks which affect The Laird Group as a 
whole. The Board instigates further reports and investigations as it considers necessary.
The Laird Risk Management Group (“RMG”), chaired by an executive director, currently Mr Drabble, and with members drawn from the 
Group’s businesses, examines all aspects of operational risk within the Group. The RMG, which met four times during the year, reports 
to the Board. The principal objectives of the RMG are to identify potential risks, physical exposure and business interruption issues 
associated with each operating company’s business and their wider implications for the Group as a whole; to review business continuity 
planning and emergency response procedures; to develop contingency plans and to oversee the implementation of remedial actions 
where appropriate; and to continue to develop and ensure the implementation of best risk management practice throughout the Group 
and review the results of comprehensive self-assessment control reviews by subsidiary management. The RMG also oversees Health, 
Safety and Environmental issues using external advisers to assist where appropriate. Further details on the RMG are set out in the 
Corporate social responsibility report on pages 24 and 25.
The Audit Committee reviews The Laird Group PLC’s financial statements. It also has responsibility for reviewing the internal financial 
controls and considers the scope and planning of internal and external audits. It reviews reports on internal financial control including 
reports by the Finance Director and the results from internal financial audits. As part of their audit, the external auditors, to the extent 
they consider necessary to support their audit opinion, review and test the systems of internal control and the data contained in the 
accounts, including an independent and objective review of the approach of management to the reporting of the operating results and 
financial condition. The auditors have confirmed that, in their opinion, the UK subsidiaries are complying with the Companies Act 1985 
requirement to keep proper books and records.
The Laird Group PLC 23 24 The Laird Group PLC
The Laird Group PLC, its Divisions and businesses (“the Group”) involves a wide community of stakeholders, including investors, 
employees, customers, suppliers and local communities. During the year the Company’s membership of the FTSE4Good UK Index, 
a financial index series that is designed to identify and facilitate investment in companies that meet globally recognised corporate 
responsibility standards, was renewed. Laird’s aim is to improve the quality of life for people around the world through the provision 
of innovative, value-added products that advance performance and protection across the electronics and the residential and home 
improvement markets.
Business Ethics
The Laird Group PLC believes that high standards of business ethics are critical in today’s business world and therefore places high 
priority on compliance with all legislative and regulatory requirements, and on the maintenance of high ethical standards, within each of 
the territories and jurisdictions in which it conducts its business.
The Group commits to conducting itself, and expects all employees to conduct themselves, in an honest, ethical manner in all dealings 
on its behalf and to behave professionally and with integrity and fairness. The Group applies these same standards to all business 
dealings with customers, suppliers and other stakeholders.
The Group’s policy is that businesses should compete enthusiastically and fairly in the marketplace and must comply with the relevant 
competition laws of each country in which it operates.
A copy of the Ethics Policy statement is available on the Company’s website or from the Company on request.
Health, Safety and Environmental
The Group is committed to providing a safe working environment for its employees and the Group maintains a proactive communications 
strategy amongst all employees to stimulate continuous improvement and promote and develop good health, safety and environmental 
practices. 
The Laird Risk Management Group (“RMG”), chaired by an executive director, currently Mr Drabble, and with members drawn from the 
Group’s businesses examines risks within the operations and in particular oversees health, safety and environmental matters. The RMG, 
which met four times during 2005, reports to the Board. 
During the year comprehensive health, safety and environmental audits were carried out at all recently acquired Group businesses and 
update audits were conducted at all other major Group facilities. The results of the health, safety and environmental audits and their 
follow up are monitored by the RMG. Health, safety and environmental training is given to designated employees and reinforced via 
refresher courses where necessary.
Although each business has its own Health and Safety Committee which has representatives from management and employees it 
is recognised that there are benefits of sharing knowledge within the Group and in the UK a Health and Safety Forum which has 
representatives from each business met during 2005. Issues discussed during the year included health, safety and environmental issues 
including new health and safety regulations and accident statistics. Across the Group, health and safety training is provided focusing on 
perceived risk within each business. 
A number of specific health and safety achievements from 2005 include;
�  Appointment of a Safety & Environmental Affairs Manager for Laird Security Systems in the US and a Director of Environmental, 
Health & Safety for Laird Technologies’ worldwide operations.
� Amesbury Textiles reduced OSHA accidents by 66% to 8 in 2005 compared to 20 in 2004.
�  UK-based EWS (Manufacturing) Limited reduced accidents by 42% in 2005 and reportable accidents by 80%, compared to 2004.
�  Each Laird Technologies facility in Greater China developed its Health & Safety Committee, which is coordinated by a Site Manager 
responsible for monitoring and modifying Health, Safety and Environmental policies and practice and organising the provision of 
appropriate employee training.
In 2005 the Group published two editions of its employee newsletter, Insight, which is available to all Group companies via email and 
intranet sites. The newsletters feature articles on charity and community involvement, employee achievements and key events within the 
Group.
Environmental Policy
The Group is committed to pursuing high standards of environmental performance including the maintenance of safe and healthy 
working environments.
Detailed policies are developed and implemented by the operating divisions and their subsidiary businesses to reflect their specific 
trading activities and the associated risks. The Group’s minimum requirements are for its businesses to comply with local legislation 
and to operate continuous improvement programmes, to ensure that efficient use is made of all resources, including energy, water 
and raw materials, that emissions are restricted to within best practice levels, waste is minimised and accidents are prevented 
through comprehensive training. 2005 was a year of progress in overall performance in the areas of health, safety and environmental 
management, as evidenced by all of the Group’s main manufacturing facilities achieving accreditation to, or re-certification to the 2004 
version of, the ISO 14001 standard, during the course of the year. Recent acquisitions are on course to achieve accreditation in 2006. 
This is in addition to the majority of the Group’s main manufacturing facilities being ISO 9000 and ISO 9001 certified. In 2006 the Group 
Corporate social responsibility
for the year to 31 December 2005 The Laird Group PLC 25
also aims to complete its integration of the occupation health and safety specification, OHSAS 18001, into each of its ISO 14001 
registered sites, to further reinforce these existing management systems.
The Group undertakes a rolling programme of environmental audits covering all of the Group’s manufacturing sites. The formalisation 
of environmental management systems via the certified Environmental and Health and Safety standards will promote continuous 
improvement and allow consistent monitoring of energy source reduction, waste treatment and the re-use and reclamation of natural 
resources.
A number of specific environmental initiatives have been carried out during the year, for example;
�  Laird Technologies in Lincoln, Nebraska achieved a 95% reduction in hazardous waste through the implementation of an on-site 
recycling programme eliminating the need to ship waste solvents to an approved site for treatment and disposal.
�  Amesbury Textiles implemented energy saving initiatives during the year resulting in increased production per KWH used and a waste 
management programme which reduced disposal to landfill from a peak of daily to once every eight weeks.
�  Laird Technologies’ St. Louis facility received a Silver Award from Missouri Water Environment Assistance in recognition of industrial 
waste water pre-treatment compliance in 2005. The business also reduced natural gas consumption by 9% compared to 2004 and 
electricity consumption by 16%.
�  UK-based Linear Limited continued its recycling programme for production and cardboard waste which has, aside from delivering 
environmental benefits, reduced its landfill and transportation costs significantly in recent years. 
�  Laird Technologies’ Cleveland facility developed a new form of corrugated cardboard packaging in partnership with their largest 
vendor and this, along with all other corrugated cardboard at the facility, is now recycled through the packaging provider.
�  Amesbury Foam-Tite established an energy conservation team to find ways to control unnecessary waste of natural gas and 
electricity by various methods, including monitoring energy use, sending employee reminders and shutting down idle equipment. The 
same business worked in co-operation with local authorities during an expansion project to encourage native wetlands plant and 
animal species to grow in natural areas of company property that had been designated for rainwater infiltration and recovery.
A copy of the Group’s Health, Safety and Environmental Policy statement is available on the Company’s website or from the Company 
on request.
Charitable Donations and Community Affairs
The well-being of the communities in which the Group operates is important to its long term development and success. 
During the year the Group gave £49,000 to national and local charities (2004, £116,000). The Group supported a number of large UK 
charities for example, Guide Dogs for the Blind, Whizz-Kidz, The Samaritans and Cancer Research. The subsidiaries of the Group, many 
of which are long-established in their communities, support a variety of local initiatives.
Examples of Group community and charity involvement activities during the year are;
�  Support by several Group companies of a variety of local sports teams through the provision of team sponsorships, kit and equipment 
donations and other fund-raising events.
�  Participation in an Annual Toys for Tots campaign through the purchasing of toys, the donation of unwanted Christmas gifts and 
active promotion of the regional programme which provides toys to needy families in the local community.
� Participation in Enterprise Support days at local schools and the provision of work experience placements.
�  Donation of food, toys and clothing to local orphanages in Ningbo, China and Penang, Malaysia and canned goods to shelters for the 
homeless in the US.
�  The Laird Group PLC Head Office, through a scheme operated by Guide Dogs for the Blind, sponsored a trainee Guide Dog puppy 
‘Hero’ and raised funds for the charity.
�  Organisation of charity coffee mornings and sponsored car washes in the UK and participation in a charity Food and Fun Fair held in 
order to raise money for a Heart Patient’s Fund at a local hospital in Malaysia.
�  Following the devastation caused by Hurricane Katrina in the United States donations and contributions were made by employees 
and businesses across the Group and a corporate donation matching scheme, similar to that established to aid the families of those 
affected by the tsunami in Asia in December 2004, was implemented. 26 The Laird Group PLC
The Directors’ remuneration report sets out the Company’s policy on the remuneration of executive and non-executive directors together 
with details of directors’ remuneration packages and service contracts.
The Remuneration Committee, which met three times during the year, is responsible for recommending to the Board the Company’s 
general policy on remuneration and in particular to determine the remuneration packages of the Chairman and the executive directors, 
and the grant of all options and awards of shares.
The members of the Committee are appointed by the Board and the membership of the Committee is reviewed at least annually. 
The Chairman of the Committee is appointed by the Board and cannot be the Chairman of the Board. The Chief Executive is given 
notice of all meetings and, at the request of the Chairman of the Committee, attends the meetings. The Chief Executive may request 
that he attends and speaks at Committee meetings. In normal circumstances, the Chief Executive will be consulted on general policy 
matters and matters concerning the other executive directors and employees. The written Terms of Reference are available on the 
Company’s website and from the Company on request. They will also be on display at the Annual General Meeting. The Remuneration 
Committee, chaired by Mr A J Reading, comprises the Chairman, Mr N J Keen, and Mr A J Reading, Mr J B McDowall, Sir Geoffrey 
Owen, Mr A M Robb and Dr W R Spivey, all independent non-executive directors. Mr D Morton was a member of the Committee until 
his retirement on 13 May 2005 and Mr McDowall chaired the Committee until 13 May 2005 when he became the senior independent 
non-executive director. Mr Keen is a member of the Committee because the Board considers it essential that the Chairman be involved 
in setting remuneration policy. Mr D J L Hudson, the Company Secretary, acts as Secretary to the Committee. The Board, as a whole, is 
responsible for setting the remuneration of the non-executive directors. 
The Remuneration Committee has during the past year retained Watson Wyatt Limited and New Bridge Street Consultants LLP to 
provide independent external professional advice. Watson Wyatt Limited also provide pension actuarial services to The Laird Group 
and to the Trustees of two of The Laird Group pension schemes. The Remuneration Committee has also sought the views of the Chief 
Executive, Mr P J Hill, during the year. 
Remuneration Policy
The Remuneration Committee has established a policy on the remuneration of executive directors and the Board has established a 
policy for the non-executive directors.
Executive Directors 
The current policy for providing remuneration for the executive directors is to have an incentive driven remuneration package which 
promotes the alignment of interests of executive directors and shareholders. That policy is based upon the following principles:
�  the need to link remuneration to achieving strategic objectives and to sustainable long-term corporate success;
�  the reward opportunity offered to executive directors should be sufficiently competitive to recruit and retain management of the 
appropriate calibre and experience; and
� the need to provide a total compensation package which reflects the international complexity of the Group’s operations.
The executive directors receive base salary, annual performance awards up to a maximum percentage of base salary, pensions and 
other benefits, and long term performance awards. Base salaries, benefits and performance awards of the executive directors are 
reviewed annually by the Remuneration Committee. Base salaries are determined with reference to an appropriate comparator group 
of companies which is reviewed annually. Benefits comprise the provision of a car or car allowance, life, disability and health insurance, 
participation in the annual performance scheme and membership of a pension scheme. Neither performance incentive awards nor 
benefits in kind are pensionable.
Performance linked incentives are a key component of the total remuneration package and, in 2003, the Remuneration Committee 
proposed a new framework for share incentive awards, encompassing new executive share option plans and a Long Term Incentive 
Plan, which was approved by shareholders at the 2003 Annual General Meeting. A summary of these arrangements is set out below.
Service Agreements
Each of the executive directors has a service agreement. Messrs Drabble, Hill and Silver’s service agreements are dated 8 March 2004. 
Mr Rapp’s service agreement is dated 31 December 2004. In line with the Company’s policy, the executive directors’ service agreements 
are not for a fixed term and provide for twelve months’ written notice of termination from either party. Mr Rapp’s service agreement 
is with Laird Technologies, Inc. and he has a separate letter also dated 31 December 2004 from the Company in respect of his 
appointment as an executive director. This appointment is for an initial period of three years but is subject to the termination provisions 
in his service agreement. The terms of employment for executive directors in the UK currently terminate automatically at the executive’s 
Normal Retirement Date of age sixty. The Company’s policy on termination is to comply with the contractual terms and conditions set 
out in the service agreement. The Company may, at its election, make a payment in lieu of notice. The payment would be calculated as 
the total of the director’s basic salary plus the value of his benefits, in each case by reference to the period of the unexpired notice of 
termination. 
The non-executive directors do not have service contracts but their appointments are subject to review every three years and the 
rotation provisions of the Company’s Articles of Association.
Directors’ remuneration report

Shareholding Guidelines
Shareholding guidelines, under which executive directors will be expected to retain as shares all of the after-tax profit on the gains made 
on the vesting of Long Term Incentive Plan awards and the exercise of existing or future executive share options, until they have acquired 
a shareholding equal in value to their basic salaries, were introduced in 2003.
Non-Executive Directors
The Laird Group’s policy is to establish and maintain a body of non-executive directors with a breadth of international skills and 
experience that is relevant to The Laird Group’s global businesses. In this context, it is the Board’s policy for the non-executive directors 
to be paid a level of fee that reflects market conditions and is sufficient to attract individuals with appropriate knowledge and experience.

Mr Hill was a non-executive director of Meggitt plc during the year and an independent board member of UK Trade & Investment for part 
of the year. He is entitled to retain the fees of £37,000 and £4,800 respectively, which were paid in addition to the above.
Mr Drabble was a non-executive director of Ashtead Group plc for part of the year and he is entitled to retain the non-executive director 
fees of £17,436 paid in addition to the above.
Annual Performance Incentive Awards
The awards in 2005 for the executive directors were determined by the Remuneration Committee. For the UK executive directors, up 
to a maximum of 75% of base salary could be earned and for Mr Rapp the maximum was 100%. The level of the award for 2005 took 
account of the improvement in financial performance and the achievement of specific financial targets in relation to profit and cash 
generation and measurable progress in meeting defined key strategic objectives of the Group and its divisions.
Pensions
M L Rapp, who is based in the USA, is a member of an employee managed defined contribution program to which Laird Technologies, 
Inc. makes a 50% match of the member’s contributions up to 6% of gross earnings.  The amount paid in by the company in 2005 was 
£3,850. G Drabble, P J Hill and J C Silver are members of a UK Group contributory defined benefits plan, which is supplemented, where 
necessary, by unfunded arrangements to maintain the same level of benefits as if the earnings cap did not apply. The main benefits are: 
on retirement at age sixty, a maximum pension of two thirds final salary (excluding bonuses and other benefits), dependent on service; 
on death in retirement, a dependant’s pension of 60% of the member’s pension; on death in service, a lump sum of four times salary and 
a dependant’s pension of 20% of salary or 60% of the member’s expected pension, if higher. The changes to the tax regime applying to 
UK pension schemes as a result of the Finance Act 2004, which are due to take effect from 6 April 2006, are being reviewed. 
Pensions in payment increase by the lesser of the increase in the retail price index or 8.5% per annum compound. Transfer values

Long Term Incentive Plan
The Long Term Incentive Plan involves the award of shares which only vest after the achievement of demanding performance targets 
measured over three years.
Executives are eligible for annual awards of shares. The maximum annual award value under the Plan is one times basic salary. In setting 
the level of awards the Remuneration Committee takes into account options granted to executives under the 2003 executive share 
option plans in the same financial year.
The extent to which awards granted under the Plan in 2005 vest will be determined by reference to the Company’s total shareholder 
return relative to FTSE 250 companies (excluding investment trusts) and the following targets will apply:
Total Shareholder Return
Performance Level
Amount of Award Vesting
%
Upper Quartile
Median to Upper Quartile
Below Median
Full vesting
Pro rata between 30% and full vesting
Nil
These performance conditions will be measured only over a single three year period. There is no provision for retesting. In addition, 
no awards will vest unless the Remuneration Committee is satisfied that there has been a sustained improvement in the Company’s 
underlying financial performance.
The Long Term Incentive Plan may use either market purchased shares or new issue shares, provided that any new shares issued will 
count against the overall dilution limit. Awards under the plan in 2003, 2004 and 2005 took the form of nil cost options to be satisfied 
by market purchased shares from the ESOP . Further details on the ESOP are on page 31. The amount charged to the profit and loss 
account during the year in respect of the Long Term Incentive Plan granted to the directors was £0.5m.
The directors’ interests in the Long Term Incentive Plan are as follows:

M L Rapp – 81,000 – 81,000 
J C Silver 188,200 81,000 – 269,200
The above awards of nil cost options were granted on 18 March 2005 (calculated with reference to a share price of 342.5p, the closing 
mid-market share price on 17 March 2005) and will be exercisable between 18 March 2008 and 18 March 2010, to the extent to which 
the performance criteria are met.
Share Options
The executive directors have outstanding options under the 1994 Executive Share Option Scheme and the 2003 Executive Share Option 
Plan (No.1). The 1994 scheme was replaced by new share option schemes approved by shareholders at the 2003 Annual General 
Meeting. Since May 2001 the basis for calculation of the maximum grant of options to executive directors and other employees is the 
equivalent of shares with a market value at the time of grant of up to one times salary in any one year and up to two times salary in 
special circumstances, such as the recruitment or promotion to a key management position. 
Following the move to annual awards in 2003, the date on which awards are made was harmonised to bring the timing more into 
line with the Company’s financial year. The performance criteria used since 2003 has been to measure the increase in earnings per 
share against the rate of UK retail price inflation plus a specified percentage per annum over a fixed three year period. The Committee 
considers that growth in earnings per share is an appropriate performance target as it is a good guide to the underlying financial 
performance of The Laird Group. The rules of the 2003 plan permit the waiver of performance criteria in certain limited circumstances, 
such as a change of control, death or retirement. 
1994 Share Option Scheme
The 1994 scheme granted options over new shares to be issued at the time of exercise (and also over existing shares). The exercise 
of options under the 1994 scheme is dependent upon the attainment of performance criteria set by the Remuneration Committee. The 
scheme permitted the grant of both approved and unapproved options. Options were granted at the middle market price on the last 
dealing day prior to grant and are exercisable after three years but not more than ten years from the date of grant.
Directors’ remuneration report (continued)
for the year to 31 December 2005 The Laird Group PLC 29
The performance criteria set by the Remuneration Committee for grants made in 2002, the last year in which options were granted 
under this Scheme, is that the increase in earnings per share must not be less than the increase in the rate of United Kingdom Retail 
Price Inflation plus an average of 3% per annum over a three year period. The Committee considered that the performance criteria had 
been met and that there had been a significant and sustained improvement in the underlying financial performance of the Company.
The 2003 Executive Share Option Plans
There are two plans which were approved by shareholders in 2003. One plan permits the grant of options approved by Her Majesty’s 
Revenue and Customs to be made to individuals who may be eligible for capital gains tax relief on the exercise of options; otherwise 
both plans are identical in all material respects. The value of shares under options granted to an executive in any financial year will be 
limited, as under the previous 1994 scheme, to one times basic salary, unless there are exceptional circumstances (e.g. a high level 
recruitment), in which case the limit will be twice basic salary. When granting options, the Remuneration Committee will take into account 
both the level of awards made to executives under the new Long Term Incentive Plan and the prevailing share price.
The performance conditions under the plans are based on the Company’s earnings per share growth adjusted to exclude items which 
do not reflect the Company’s underlying financial performance. The following targets applied for options granted in 2005 and the 
earnings per share growth is measured from a base point of 25.9p.
Tier of Option Grant Applicable Performance Target: Average Annual growth in earnings per share in excess of inflation
Up to 0.5 x salary
0.5 x salary – 1 x salary and above
UK RPI + 3% per annum
UK RPI + 3% to 5% per annum applied pro rata to the multiple of salary
The performance conditions will be measured over a three year period. To the extent that the performance conditions have not been met 
after three years, the options will lapse.
In order to allow for the grant of options to employees who are not executive directors, there is an overall dilution limit of 10% of the 
ordinary share capital in issue from time to time for allocations in respect of newly issued shares over a ten year period under these plans 
and all other share schemes operated by the Company.

Directors’ remuneration report (continued)
for the year to 31 December 2005 The Laird Group PLC 33
The directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report and the financial statements in accordance with applicable United 
Kingdom law and those International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the European Union.
The directors are required to prepare financial statements for each financial year which present fairly the financial position of the Group 
and the financial performance and cash flows of the Group for that period. In preparing those financial statements, the directors are 
required to:
�  select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently;
�  present information, including accounting policies, in a manner that provides relevant, reliable, comparable and understandable 
information; and
�  provide additional disclosures when compliance with the specific requirements in IFRS is insufficient to enable users to understand
the impact of particular transactions, other events and conditions on the entity’s financial position and financial performance; and
�  state that the Group has complied with IFRS, subject to any material departures disclosed and explained in the financial statements.
The directors are responsible for keeping proper accounting records which disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial 
position of the Group and enable them to ensure that the financial statements comply with the Companies Act 1985 and Article 4 of 
the IAS Regulation. They are also responsible for safeguarding the assets of the Group and hence for taking reasonable steps for the 
prevention and detection of fraud and other irregularities.
Statement of directors’ responsibilities 
in relation to the Group financial statements 34 The Laird Group PLC
We have audited the Group financial statements of The Laird Group PLC for the year ended 31 December 2005 which comprise the Group 
Income Statement, the Group Balance Sheet, the Group Cash Flow Statement, the Statement of Recognised Income and Expense and the 
related notes 1 to 37. These Group financial statements have been prepared under the accounting policies set out therein.
We have reported separately on the parent company financial statements of The Laird Group PLC for the year ended 31 December 
2005 and on the information in the Directors’ remuneration report that is described as having been audited. 
This report is made solely to the Company’s members, as a body, in accordance with Section 235 of the Companies Act 1985. Our 
audit work has been undertaken so that we might state to the Company’s members those matters we are required to state to them in 
an auditors’ report and for no other purpose. To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility to anyone 
other than the Company and the Company’s members as a body, for our audit work, for this report, or for the opinions we have formed.
Respective responsibilities of directors and auditors
The directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report and the group financial statements in accordance with applicable United 
Kingdom law and International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the European Union as set out in the Statement of 
Directors’ Responsibilities.
Our responsibility is to audit the Group financial statements in accordance with relevant legal and regulatory requirements and 
International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland).
We report to you our opinion as to whether the Group financial statements give a true and fair view and whether the Group financial 
statements have been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 1985 and Article 4 of the IAS Regulation. We also 
report to you if, in our opinion, the Directors’ report is not consistent with the Group financial statements, if we have not received all 
the information and explanations we require for our audit, or if information specified by law regarding director’s remuneration and other 
transactions is not disclosed.
We review whether the Corporate governance report reflects the Company’s compliance with the nine provisions of the 2003 FRC 
Combined Code specified for our review by the Listing Rules of the Financial Services Authority, and we report if it does not. We are 
not required to consider whether the Board’s statements on internal control cover all risks and controls, or form an opinion on the 
effectiveness of the Group’s corporate governance procedures or its risk and control procedures.
We read other information contained in the Annual Report and consider whether it is consistent with the audited Group financial 
statements.  The other information comprises only the Directors’ report, the unaudited part of the Directors’ remuneration report, the 
Chairman’s statement, the Chief Executive’s report and review, the Finance Director’s report and the Corporate governance report. We 
consider the implications for our report if we become aware of any apparent misstatements or material inconsistencies with the Group 
financial statements. Our responsibilities do not extend to any other information.
Basis of audit opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland) issued by the Auditing Practices Board. 
An audit includes examination, on a test basis, of evidence relevant to the amounts and disclosures in the group financial statements. It also 
includes an assessment of the significant estimates and judgments made by the directors in the preparation of the Group financial statements, 
and of whether the accounting policies are appropriate to the Group’s circumstances, consistently applied and adequately disclosed.
We planned and performed our audit so as to obtain all the information and explanations which we considered necessary in order to 
provide us with sufficient evidence to give reasonable assurance that the Group financial statements are free from material misstatement, 
whether caused by fraud or other irregularity or error. In forming our opinion we also evaluated the overall adequacy of the presentation 
of information in the Group financial statements.
Opinion
In our opinion the Group financial statements:
�  give a true and fair view, in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the European Union, of the state of the Group’s affairs as at
31 December 2005 and of its profit for the year then ended; and
� have been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 1985 and Article 4 of the IAS  Regulation.

 1 Authorisation of financial statements and statement of compliance with IFRS
The Group’s financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2005 were authorised for issue by the Board of Directors on 
15 March 2006 and the balance sheet was signed on the Board’s behalf by P J Hill and J C Silver. The Laird Group PLC is a 
public limited company incorporated and domiciled in England and Wales and its ordinary shares are traded on the London Stock 
Exchange.
The Group’s financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted 
for use in the European Union (IFRS) and the principal accounting policies adopted by the Group are set out in note 2.
 2 Accounting policies
Basis of preparation
The consolidated financial statements have been prepared on an historical or deemed cost basis, except for derivative financial 
instruments, that have been measured at fair value. The carrying values of recognised assets and liabilities that are fair value 
hedged are adjusted to record changes in the fair values attributable to the risks that are being hedged. The consolidated 
financial statements are presented in pounds sterling and all values are rounded to the nearest million unless otherwise indicated.
IFRS1 permits companies adopting IFRS for the first time to take exemptions from the full requirements of IFRS in the transition 
period. These financial statements have been prepared on the basis of taking the following exemptions:
 Business combinations prior to 1 January 2004 have not been restated to comply with IFRS3 ‘Business Combinations’.
 The revalued amounts for plant, property and equipment under previous GAAP have been deemed as cost under IFRS.
  Cumulative translation differences on foreign operations are deemed to be zero at 1 January 2004. Any gains and losses 
recognised in the Group Income Statement on subsequent disposals of foreign operations will therefore exclude translation 
differences arising prior to 1 January 2004.
 IAS 32 and IAS 39 have been adopted from 1 January 2005, with no restatement of comparative information.
  The Group has applied IFRS 2 only in respect of equity settled awards granted after 7 November 2002 that had not vested on 
or before 1 January 2005.
Principal accounting policies
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires the directors to make 
judgements and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingencies at the date 
of the financial statements and the reported income and expense during the reporting periods. Although these judgements and 
assumptions are based on the directors’ best knowledge of the amount, events or actions, actual results may differ from these 
estimates.
The accounting policies set out below have been used to prepare the financial information.
Basis of consolidation
The consolidated Group comprises The Laird Group PLC (‘the Group’) and all of its subsidiaries. The financial statements of the 
subsidiaries are prepared as of the same reporting date as the parent, using consistent accounting policies. Intra-group balances 
and transactions are eliminated in full.
Subsidiaries are consolidated from the date on which control is transferred to the Group and are included until the date on which 
the Group ceases to control them.
All business combinations are accounted for using the purchase method. The cost of a business combination is measured as the 
aggregate of the fair values, at the acquisition date, of any assets given, liabilities incurred or assumed, and equity instruments 
issued by the Group, plus any costs directly attributable to the combination. The identifiable assets and liabilities of the acquiree 
are measured initially at fair value at the acquisition date. The excess of the cost of the business combination over the Group’s 
interest in the net fair value of the identifiable assets, including those of an intangible and tangible nature, liabilities and contingent 
liabilities is recognised as goodwill.
Notes to the financial statements
for the year ended 31 December 2005 40 The Laird Group PLC
note
 2 Accounting policies (continued)
Currency translation
The financial statements for each of the Group’s subsidiaries are prepared using its functional currency. The functional currency is 
the currency of the primary economic environment in which an entity operates. The presentation currency of the Group is sterling.
Foreign currency transactions are recorded at the exchange rate ruling on the date of transaction. Foreign currency monetary 
assets and liabilities are translated at the rates of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date.
In the Group accounts the results and cash flows of overseas subsidiaries are translated into sterling using weighted average 
rates of exchange for the period. Net investments in overseas subsidiaries are translated into sterling at the rates of exchange 
ruling at the balance sheet date. Exchange differences arising from retranslating opening net investments and the retained 
profits for the period of overseas subsidiaries, less exchange differences on foreign currency borrowings that provide a hedge 
against overseas investments, are shown as movements on reserves. All other exchange differences are dealt with in the Income 
Statement for the period.
Exchange differences arising from 1 January 2004 are recognised as a separate component of shareholders’ equity. On disposal 
of a foreign operation, any cumulative exchange differences held in shareholders’ equity that relate to the disposed operation are 
transferred to the Income Statement.
Revenue recognition
Revenue is measured at the fair value of consideration received and excludes intra-group sales and value-added taxes and 
represents net invoice value.
Revenue is recognised when the significant risks and rewards of ownership have been transferred to a third party, the amount of 
revenue can be measured reliably, and it is probable that the economic benefits associated with the transaction will flow to the 
Group.
Retirement benefit obligations
Under IAS 19 the assets and liabilities of defined benefit pension plans are recognised at fair value in the balance sheet and 
the operating and financing costs of defined benefit pension plans are recognised in the Income Statement as operating costs 
and interest costs respectively. Variations from expected costs, arising from the experience of the plans or changes in actuarial 
assumptions are recognised immediately in the Statement of Recognised Income and Expense (SORIE).
The Group’s accounting policy for pensions will apply the option allowed under IAS 19 to take actuarial gains and losses directly 
to equity through the SORIE in the period in which they occur.
The cost of providing benefits under the defined benefit plans is determined separately for each plan using the projected unit 
credit method, which attributes entitlement to benefits to the current period (to determine current service cost) and to the current 
and prior periods (to determine the present value of defined benefit obligation) and is based on actuarial advice. The assets of 
defined benefit plans are recognised at fair value in the balance sheet and the liabilities are recognised at present value using a 
high quality corporate bond rate. 
Contributions to defined contribution schemes are recognised in the Income Statement in the period in which they become 
payable.
Share based payments
In accordance with the transitional provisions of IFRS 2, the expense recognised in the Income Statement relates to equity settled 
grants made after 7 November 2002 that had not vested on 1 January 2005.
The fair value of Long Term Incentive Plan (LTIP) shares awarded is estimated at the date of award, using a Monte Carlo 
simulation technique, taking into account the terms and conditions upon which the LTIP shares were awarded including market 
based performance conditions. The fair value of share options granted is estimated at the date of grant using a binomial lattice 
method of calculation, taking into account the terms and conditions upon which share options were granted. Non-market 
company performance conditions are not taken into account when estimating the fair value. 
No expense is recognised for grants that do not ultimately vest and charges previously made are reversed except that an 
expense is recognised for awards where vesting is conditional upon a market condition and these are treated as vesting 
irrespective of whether or not the market condition is satisfied, provided all the other performance conditions are satisfied. 
At each balance sheet date before vesting, the cumulative expense is calculated, representing the extent to which the vesting 
period has expired and management’s best estimate of the achievement or otherwise of non-market conditions, the number of 
equity instruments that will ultimately vest or in the case of an instrument subject to a market condition, be treated as vesting 
as described above. The movement in cumulative expense since the previous balance sheet date is recognised in the Income 
Statement, with a corresponding entry in equity.
Where the terms for an equity settled award are modified, as a minimum, an expense is recognised as if the terms had not 
been modified. In addition, an expense is recognised for any modification, which increases the total fair value of the share based 
payment, or is otherwise beneficial to the employee as measured at the date of modification.
Notes to the financial statements (continued)
for the year ended 31 December 2005 The Laird Group PLC 41
note
 2 Accounting policies (continued)
In circumstances where the equity settled grant is cancelled or settled, it is treated as if it had vested on the date of cancellation 
or settlement, and any expense not yet recognised for the grant is recognised immediately. 
Intangible assets
Acquired intangible assets, including patents, trade secrets, brand names and customer relationships, are recognised separately 
from goodwill and capitalised at fair value and amortised over their estimated useful economic lives. Amortisation is charged to 
the Income Statement on a straight-line basis. The estimated useful life of an intangible asset ranges between 3 and 17 years 
depending on its nature.
Research and development
Research and development expenditure is expensed as it is incurred, except for certain development costs, which are capitalised 
as intangible assets when it is probable that the development project will be commercially viable, and certain criteria, including 
commercial and technological feasibility have been met. Intangible assets arising in this manner are amortised over their useful 
economic lives, from the product launch date, which is typically less than two years. Intangible assets relating to products in the 
development phase, both internally generated and externally acquired, are subject to an impairment review at each balance sheet 
date, or earlier should indication of impairment arise. Any impairment losses are written off immediately to income.
Goodwill
On the acquisition of a business, fair values are attributed to the net assets acquired. Goodwill arises where the fair value of the 
consideration given for a business exceeds the fair value of such net assets.
Goodwill arising on acquisitions is capitalised and subject to impairment review, both annually and when there are indications that 
the carrying value may not be recoverable.
Goodwill arising on acquisitions before 1 January 2004 has been retained at the previous UK GAAP amounts, subject to being 
tested for impairment at that date. Goodwill set off to reserves under UK GAAP prior to 1998 has not been reinstated and is not 
included in determining any subsequent profit or loss on disposal.
Income taxes
Current tax assets and liabilities are measured at the amount expected to be recovered from or paid to the taxation authorities, 
based on tax rates and laws that are enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.
Deferred income tax is recognised on all temporary differences arising between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their 
carrying amounts in the financial statements, with the following exceptions:
�  where the temporary difference arises from the initial recognition of goodwill or of an asset or liability in a transaction that is 
not a business combination that at the time of the transaction effects neither accounting nor taxable profit or loss;
�  in respect of taxable temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries, where the timing of the reversal of the 
temporary differences can be controlled and it is probable that the temporary differences will not reverse in the foreseeable 
future; and
�  deferred income tax assets are recognised only to the extent that it is probable that taxable profit will be available against 
which the deductible temporary differences, carried forward tax credits or tax losses can be utilised:
Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are measured on an undiscounted basis at the tax rates that are expected to apply 
when the related asset is realised or liability is settled, based on tax rates and laws enacted or substantively enacted at the 
balance sheet date.
Income tax is charged or credited directly to equity if it relates to items that are credited or charged to equity. Otherwise income 
tax is recognised in the Income Statement.
Dividends
Dividends paid are charged to retained earnings on the earlier of the date of payment or the date on which they become a legal 
liability of the Company.
Interest
Interest is recognised in the Income Statement using the effective interest method.
Property, plant and equipment
Property, plant and equipment is carried at cost less accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment losses. Cost 
comprises the purchase price and directly attributable costs, for example, initial delivery and handling costs and installation and 
assembly costs. 42 The Laird Group PLC
note
 2 Accounting policies (continued)
Freehold land and assets under construction are not depreciated. For all other property, plant, and equipment depreciation is 
calculated on a straight line basis to allocate cost less residual values of the assets over their useful lives as follows:
Freehold buildings 50 years or less
Leasehold land and buildings 50 years or the lease term if less
Computer equipment  5 years or less
Motor vehicles  4 years
Other plant and machinery 13 years or less
A proportion of one year’s depreciation is charged in the year the asset comes into service or is sold.
Residual values and useful lives are reviewed at least at each financial year end.
Impairment of assets
The Group assesses at each reporting date whether there is an indication that an asset may be impaired. If any such indication 
exists, or when annual impairment testing for an asset is required, the Group makes an estimate of the asset’s recoverable 
amount. An asset’s recoverable amount is the higher of an asset’s or cash-generating unit’s fair value less costs to sell and 
its value in use and is determined for an individual asset, unless the asset does not generate cash inflows that are largely 
independent of those from other assets or groups of assets. Where the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its recoverable 
amount, the asset is considered impaired and is written down to its recoverable amount. In assessing value in use, the estimated 
future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments 
of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset. Impairment losses of continuing operations are recognised in the 
Income Statement in those expense categories consistent with the function of the impaired asset.
Leases
Where the Group has substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of an asset subject to a lease, the lease is treated as a 
finance lease. All other leases are treated as operating leases, and are expensed to the Income Statement as incurred.
Assets held under finance leases are capitalised and included in tangible fixed assets at fair value. Each asset is depreciated 
over the shorter of the lease term or the useful life of the asset. The obligations relating to finance leases, net of finance charges 
in respect of future periods, are included as appropriate under current, or non-current, trade and other payables. The interest 
element of the rental obligation is allocated to accounting periods during the lease term to reflect a constant rate of interest on 
the remaining balance of the obligation for each accounting period.
Segment reporting
The Group’s primary reporting format is business segments and its secondary format is geographical segments. A business 
segment is a component of the Group that is engaged in providing a group of related products and is subject to risks and 
returns that are different from those of other business segments. A geographical segment is a component of the Group that 
operates within a particular economic environment and is subject to risks and returns that are different from those of components 
operating in other economic environments.
Exceptional items
These items are presented within the relevant Income Statement category. The separate reporting of exceptional items helps 
provide a better indication of the Group’s underlying business performance. Events which may give rise to the classification of 
items as exceptional include the restructuring of businesses, the integration of new businesses, gains or losses on the disposal of 
businesses, and asset impairments.
Financial assets 
Financial assets include cash and cash equivalents and trade receivables. Trade receivables are recognised and carried at the 
lower of their original invoiced value and recoverable amount. Where the time value of money is material, receivables are carried 
at amortised cost. Provision is made when there is objective evidence that the Group will not be able to recover balances in full. 
Balances are written off when the probability of recovery is assessed as being remote. The Group assesses at each balance 
sheet date whether a financial asset or group of financial assets is impaired. Gains and losses are recognised in income when the 
loans and receivables are derecognised or impaired. 
If there is objective evidence that an impairment loss on loans and receivables carried at amortised cost has been incurred, the 
amount of the loss is measured as the difference between the asset’s carrying amount and the present value of estimated future 
cash flows (excluding future credit losses that have not been incurred) discounted at the financial asset’s original effective interest 
rate (i.e., the effective interest rate computed at initial recognition). The carrying amount of the asset is reduced, with the amount 
of the loss recognised in the Income Statement.
If, in a subsequent period, the amount of the impairment loss decreases and the decrease can be related objectively to an event 
occurring after the impairment was recognised, the previously recognised impairment loss is reversed. Any subsequent reversal of 
an impairment loss is recognised in the Income Statement, to the extent that the carrying value of the asset does not exceed its 
amortised cost at the reversal date.
Notes to the financial statements (continued)
for the year ended 31 December 2005 The Laird Group PLC 43
note
 2 Accounting policies (continued)
Derivative financial assets are classified as held for trading, unless they are designated as hedging instruments. These assets are 
carried in the balance sheet at fair value with gains or losses in value being recognised in the Income Statement.
A financial asset (or, where applicable a part of a financial asset or part of a group of similar financial assets) is derecognised 
where:
 the rights to receive cash flows from the asset have expired; or
  the Group has transferred its rights to receive cash flows from the asset and either (a) has transferred substantially all the risks 
and rewards of the asset, or (b) has neither transferred nor retained substantially all the risks and rewards of the asset, but 
has transferred control of the asset.
Financial liabilities
All financial liabilities are initially recognised at fair value. Measurement after initial recognition is at amortised cost, with the 
changes in the carrying amount being taken through the Income Statement.
Interest bearing loans and borrowings
All loans and borrowings are initially recognised at fair value less directly attributable transaction costs. 
After initial recognition, interest-bearing loans and borrowings are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective 
interest method. Gains and losses arising on the repurchase, settlement or otherwise cancellation of liabilities are recognised 
respectively in finance income and finance expense.
A financial liability is derecognised when the obligation under the liability is discharged or cancelled or expires.
Derivative financial instruments and hedging
The Group may use derivative financial instruments such as forward currency contracts and interest rate swaps to hedge its risks 
associated with foreign currency and interest rate fluctuations. From 1 January 2005, such derivative financial instruments are 
initially recognised at fair value on the date on which a derivative contract is entered into and are subsequently remeasured at fair 
value. Any gains or losses arising from changes in the fair value of derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting are taken 
to the Income Statement. Derivatives are carried as assets when the fair value is positive and as liabilities when the fair value is 
negative. 
The fair value of forward currency contracts is calculated by reference to current forward exchange rates for contracts with similar 
maturity profiles. The fair value of interest rate swap contracts is determined by reference to market values for similar instruments.
For those contracts designated as hedges the hedging relationship is documented at its inception. This documentation identifies 
the hedging instrument, the hedged item or transaction, the nature of the risk being hedged and how effectiveness will be 
measured throughout its duration. Such hedges are tested, both at inception to ensure they are expected to be effective and 
periodically throughout their duration to assess continuing effectiveness.
Net investment hedges
These are used to hedge exposure to changes in the value of the Group’s interests in the net assets of foreign operations. The 
portion of the gain or loss on the hedging instrument that is determined to be an effective hedge is recognised in shareholders’ 
equity, with any ineffective portion recognised in the Income Statement. 
Interest rate swaps
The interest rate swap contract has not been designated as a hedge and gains or losses arising on this contract are taken to the 
Income Statement.
Derivative financial instruments and hedging for the year ended 31 December 2004
Comparative figures continue to be shown on a UK GAAP basis, as the Group has taken advantage of the IFRS 1 exemption, 
deferring the adoption of IAS 32 and 39 until 1 January 2005. The accounting policy for financial instruments under UK GAAP 
was:
Forward contracts are used to hedge foreign currency exposures arising on committed future transactions in foreign currencies. 
The rates under such contracts are used to record the hedged item. 
Interest differentials on interest rate swaps are recognised by adjusting net interest payable on an accruals basis. Interest rate 
swaps are not revalued to fair value prior to maturity.
Net investment hedges are used to hedge exposure to changes in the value of the Group’s interest in the net assets of foreign 
operations. The portion of the gain or loss on the hedging instrument that is determined to be an effective hedge is recognised in 
shareholders equity, with any ineffective portion recognised in the Income Statement. 44 The Laird Group PLC
note
 2 Accounting policies (continued)
Treasury shares
The Laird Group PLC shares held in the ESOP are classified in shareholders’ equity as ‘treasury shares’ and are recognised at 
cost. Consideration received for the sale of such shares is also recognised in equity, with any difference between the proceeds 
from sale and the original cost being taken to revenue reserves. No gain or loss is recognised in the performance statements on 
the purchase, sale, issue or cancellation of equity shares.
Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and short-term deposits in the balance sheet comprise cash at bank and in hand and short-term deposits with an original 
maturity in three months or less.
For the purpose of the consolidated cash flow statement, cash and cash equivalents consist of cash and cash equivalents as 
defined above, net of outstanding bank overdrafts.
Inventories
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realisable value. For finished goods and work in progress, cost includes 
directly attributable costs and certain overhead expenses (principally administration costs) are excluded. Net realisable value is 
determined as estimated selling price less all estimated costs of completion and costs to be incurred in marketing, selling, and 
distribution.
Provisions
These comprise liabilities of uncertain timing or amount. Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present obligation 
(legal or constructive) as a result of a past event, it is probable that an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits will be 
required to settle the obligation and a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation. Provisions for restructuring 
are recognised when the Group has approved a detailed and formal restructuring plan, and the restructuring has either 
commenced or has been publicly announced on or before the balance sheet date. Provisions are discounted where the time 
value of money is material.

Capitalised development costs
All internally generated assets arising from the capitalisation of qualifying development expenditure in 2005 have a finite expected 
useful life of 2 years. Capitalised development expenditure is amortised on a straight line basis. No development expenditure was 
capitalised in 2004 as the required documentation was not in place. All amortisation charges for the year have been charged 
against operating profits. The total amount of research and development activity expensed during 2005 is £13.4m (2004, £7.7m). 
There is no indication of impairment for capitalised development costs.
Goodwill
Goodwill is not amortised, but is reviewed annually for indications of impairment in accordance with IAS 36. No indications of 
impairment to goodwill were identified.
Only the Laird Technologies group of cash generating units have a significant carrying value of goodwill £277m (2004 £245m), 
in comparison with the Group’s total carrying amount of goodwill. The remainder of goodwill is allocated across multiple cash 
generating units, and the amount allocated to each unit is not significant in comparison with the Group’s total carrying amount of 
goodwill. The aggregate carrying amount of goodwill allocated to these units is £45.5m. All of the recoverable amounts are based 
on value in use.
For Laird Technologies the key assumptions were:
� Projected cash flows for 2006, 2007 and 2008 (2004: 2005, 2006 and 2007)
�  The equity market risk premium, calculated as 4% (2004, 5.0%). This is an internally calculated figure, having been confirmed 
with external advisors as being reasonable
�  Laird’s beta, calculated as 1.3 (2004, 1.2). This is an internally calculated figure, having been confirmed with external advisors 
as being reasonable 56 The Laird Group PLC
note
 17  Intangible assets (continued) 
The forecasts provided are based on figures approved internally for the 2006 budget, which also include 2007 estimates. 
Subsequent cash flows have been increased at a conservative rate estimate of 3% (2004, 3%) per annum. The cash flow figures 
were discounted using a pre-tax discount rate of 10.3% (2004, 11.6%).
Other acquired intangible assets
Assets in this class are amortised over their estimated useful lives on a straight line basis.
All amortisation charges for the year have been charged against operating profits. 
The following useful lives have been determined for acquired intangible assets:
 Brand names – 5 years
 Trade secrets – 8 to 15 years
 Trade marks and names – 5 to 15 years
 Patents – the remaining duration of the 17 year legal right
 Customer relationships – 10 years
The expected life assigned to acquired customer relationships is an estimate and is not secured by any legal obligation on the 
customer to continue business with the Group for any finite period. Other than goodwill, the Group does not hold any intangible 
assets with an indefinite life.

 Acquisition of businesses
The Group purchased four businesses during the year for a total consideration of £32.4m and all of these purchases have been 
accounted for as acquisitions. All intangible assets were recognised at their respective fair values. The residual excess over the 
net assets acquired is recognised as goodwill in the financial statements.

Cateron Corporation, a Taiwanese based supplier of EMI shielding, gaskets and tape, was acquired for a cash consideration 
(at an average exchange rate) of £13.4m in January 2005. Securidor Limited, a UK based manufacturer of composite doors, 
was acquired for a cash consideration of £4.2m in May 2005. Builders Hardware Inc., a supplier of window and door hardware 
in the USA, was acquired for a cash consideration of £5.6m in September 2005. Melcor Corporation, a US based manufacturer 
of thermoelectric modules and cooling systems, was acquired for a cash consideration of £10.8m in October 2005. The Group 
has acquired a 100% interest in all of the above acquisitions. Cateron’s business operations have been integrated into Laird 
Technologies. Profit before tax of the other entities acquired in the period total £0.9m since acquisition. If the acquisitions noted 
above had been held for the full year revenues from continuing operations for the Group would have been £14.0m higher, at 
£504.3m and profit before tax from continuing operations would have been £1.4m higher, at £35.7m.
There have been changes made during 2005 to the provisional fair values of £164.1m assigned to acquisitions made in 2004 and 
deferred consideration arising from prior year earn out agreements. The effect of these changes was to increase goodwill carried 
forward at 31 December 2005 by £1.2m.
Details of all significant subsidiaries held by the Group are disclosed in the list of ‘Principal subsidiaries’ on page 80. After the 
balance sheet date the Group has acquired Antenex Inc,  Bandlock Corporation and Balance UK Limited for an aggregate

(a) Borrowings included £nil (2004 £0.2m) secured on the assets of certain subsidiary undertakings. 
(b)  US Private Placement loans, arising from private placements of debt with US insurance companies, comprise Senior Notes 
of $5.5m repayable in 2006 at a fixed rate of interest of 9.55%, $50m repayable between 2008 and 2014 at an average fixed 
rate of interest of 7.42% and $140m repayable between 2014 and 2016 at an average fixed rate of interest of 5.64%.
(c)  The Group had committed bilateral revolving bank loan facilities of £195m which were underwritten in excess of four years. 
Drawings by Group companies under these facilities were £55.1m (2004, £32.0m). Although these drawings are repayable 
within one year they are classified as long term as they can be refinanced under the terms of the facilities. 
(d)  Ancillary costs incurred in connection with the arrangement of borrowings are amortised over the term of the facility, using the 
effective interest rate method. The Laird Group PLC 59

 25 Deferred taxes (continued) 
Deferred tax assets have been established in respect of tax losses and other temporary differences where it is probable that 
these assets will be recovered.
Deferred tax assets have not been established on pension deficits of £16.4m (2004, asset of £1.9m), or trading losses of £4.7m 
(2004, £nil) where it is unlikely that future relief would be available at the balance sheet date.
No deferred tax has been recognised on the unremitted earnings of overseas subsidiaries. The taxable temporary difference 
associated with investments in subsidiaries, for which a deferred tax liability has not been recognised aggregate to £0.8m 
(2004, £nil).

Warranty claims are in respect of potential warranty and other claims arising from the disposal of businesses.
Onerous lease provisions relate to the sale of the Permacell Finesse business as described in note 7. The provision has been 
discounted and is stated at its present value.
Other provisions consist mostly of amounts provided in respect of events arising from trade and various other provisions from 
Group companies that do not fit into distinct categories. The timing of cash outflows for warranty claims and other provisions are 
by their nature uncertain and dependent upon the outcome of related events. The best estimates are shown in the table above.

Interest rate swaps
The Group holds an interest rate swap contract to manage interest rate exposure with an underlying notional principal amount of 
$70m. The contract is disclosed in accordance with IAS 32 and accounted for in accordance with IAS 39. The contract has not 
been designated as a hedge and the decrease in the fair value during 2005 of £1.1m, has been taken to the Income Statement.

Currency exposures
The Group’s revenues and profits are affected by currency movements on translating overseas revenues and profits into Sterling 
for reporting purposes. The actual translation effects on cross border transactions which involve the sale of goods and services 
in currencies foreign to a Group entity are not significant taking into account that a number of currencies are pegged to the 
US dollar. The Group’s policy is for subsidiaries to take out forward foreign exchange contracts to cover their net transaction 
exposures to foreign currencies. The Group’s Chinese entities are not permitted to make loans to other Group entities outside 
China but distributions are permitted from audited reserves.
The Group does not have any significant transactional currency exposures on financial assets and liabilities on which net currency 
gains and losses would be recognised in the Income Statement.
Net investment hedging
Included in borrowings are US $170.0m of debt (£99.0m) which have been designated as a hedge of the net investments in 
the United States subsidiaries and Czk 351.4m (£8.3m) designated as a hedge of the net investment in the Czech Republic 
subsidiary. These amounts are being used to hedge the Group’s exposure to foreign exchange risk on these investments. Gains 
or losses on the retranslation of the borrowings are transferred to equity to offset any gains or losses on translation of the net 
investments in the subsidiaries. 64 The Laird Group PLC

Credit risk
Laird Technologies’ customer base is largely focused in the global electronics market where it has leading positions in its principal 
products with customers who themselves have significant market shares. Inevitably, this results in levels of business and trade 
receivables that are material in the overall Group context.

Loan covenants
The principal covenants in the Group’s committed loan facilities and loan note agreements that place restrictions on net 
borrowings are based on UK GAAP and are set out below:
Interest cover
The interest cover covenant is for earnings before exceptional items, interest, tax and amortisation (“EBITDA”) to be not less than 
2.5 times interest payable.
Net borrowings: EBITDA ratio
Net borrowings must not exceed 3.5 times earnings before depreciation, amortisation, exceptional items, interest and tax.
Consolidated net worth
The ratio of consolidated net worth must not exceed 1.25. Net worth is defined as Shareholders’ funds plus goodwill amortised 
or written off since 31 December 1995. Additionally net worth must not fall below £130m or fall in excess of 40% in any one fiscal 
year.
The Group was in compliance with the covenants detailed above at 31 December 2005.

At 31 December 2005 options to subscribe for 3,476,573 ordinary shares at prices between 143.5p and 456.5p were outstanding 
under the Company’s executive share option schemes. Options outstanding under the schemes are held by 48 individuals and are 
exercisable at various times up to 19 March 2015. No further options have been granted since the year end.
30  Share based payments
The Directors’ remuneration report on page 26, sets out the general terms and conditions including vesting requirements for all 
share based payment schemes; the Long Term Incentive Plan (LTIP), the 1994 Share Option Scheme and the 2003 Executive 
Share Option Plans.
All share based payments are equity settled. An expense of £1.6m was recognised in the year (2004 £0.8m) before employer’s 
national insurance and was based on the fair value of the LTIP’s shares awarded and the share options granted.
The following table shows the number of LTIP awards including LTIP awards granted during the year.

balance of the share options were granted prior to 7 November 2002 and do not result in a charge against profits in accordance 
with the transitional arrangements of IFRS 2. The weighted average share price at the date of exercise for the options exercised 
was 353p (2004, 337p). For the share options outstanding at 31 December 2005, the weighted average remaining contractual

All shares in the table above were recognised in accordance with IFRS 2 as noted above. The weighted average share price at 
the date of exercise for the options exercised was 345p. None were exercised in 2004. For the share options outstanding at 31 
December 2005, the weighted average remaining contractual life is 8.3 years (2004, 8.8 years). 194,000 options (2004, 194,000) 
in the price range 140p to 250p and 558,800 options (2004, 267,200) in the price range 251p to 343p are subject to the higher 
performance targets set out in the table on page 29 of the Directors’ remuneration report.
The fair value of LTIP shares awarded is estimated as at the date of award, using a Monte Carlo simulation technique, taking 
into account the terms and conditions upon which the LTIP’s shares were awarded including the market based performance 
conditions set out in the Directors’ remuneration report. 
The fair value of share options granted is estimated as at the date of grant using a binomial lattice method of calculation, 
taking into account the terms and conditions upon which share options were granted. The non-market company performance 
conditions set out in the Directors’ remuneration report are not taken into account when estimating the fair value. 
The weighted average fair value of LTIP awards during the year was 195p (2004, 177p) and of share options granted during the 
year was 108p (2004, 92p).
The following table lists the inputs to the valuation models for the years ended 31 December 2004 and 31 December 2005.

The expected life of the share based payments is based on historical data and is not necessarily indicative of exercise patterns 
that may occur. 
The expected volatility of the LTIP shares is based on historical volatility; average of monthly activity over the last three years. 
Expected volatility reflects the assumptions that the historical volatility is indicative of future trends, which may not necessarily 
prove to be the actual outcome. Dividends are not payable on the LTIP shares prior to vesting and this is taken into account in 
calculating the fair value. 
For the share option schemes, no allowance is considered necessary for leavers pre-vesting.

There are legal claims against the Company or its subsidiary undertakings but none where the Board takes the view that it is likely 
that damages will be awarded against the Group which would have a materially adverse effect on its financial position. 
Certain subsidiary undertakings had contingent liabilities at 31 December 2005 in respect of hire of plant under leasing contracts.
 36  Retirement benefit obligations
Pension schemes
The Group operates a number of pension schemes of both the defined benefit and defined contribution types.
Approximately 500 (2004, 650) employees are members of seven different defined benefit schemes and these schemes have 
approximately 1,900 (2004, 1,800) deferred and current pensioners. The employer contributions made to these schemes during 
the year was £7.6m (2004, £2.2m). 
The total assessed value of the schemes’ assets at 31 December 2005 at their market value is estimated at £78.2m (2004, 
£64.6m) and the liabilities estimated at £94.6m (2004, £79.4m). The resultant aggregate net pension liability under IAS 19 
is £16.4m (2004, £14.8m). Since last year equity markets have risen, however this increase has not been sufficient to offset 
reductions in corporate bond yields and higher longevity assumptions for the schemes’ members which impact upon the value of 
discounted liabilities, resulting in a higher aggregate net pension liability. 
The market value of the schemes’ assets, the present value of the schemes’ liabilities and the net pension liability under IAS 19 at 
31 December were as follows:
         2005 2004
         £m £m
  
  Annuities      10.2 10.4

  Total market value of assets     78.2 64.6
  Present value of scheme liabilities     (94.6) (79.4)
  
  Deficit in the schemes      (16.4) (14.8)
  
There are minor variations in the assumptions used by the different actuaries employed to value the separate schemes. The 
expected long term rates of return on gilts and bonds are estimated at 4.4% per annum (2004, 4.6%) and those for equities at 
7.8% per annum (2004, 8.2%). The returns on the annuities match the relevant liabilities.
The mortality assumption used at the year end is based on 92 series tables with a medium cohort allowance for future mortality 
improvements to 2015 for pensioners and 2025 for non-pensioners. The future life expectancies are around 2 years longer than 
those assumed at the last year end.
For IAS 19 the schemes’ liabilities have been calculated under the projected unit method and the main financial assumptions 
were inflation of 2.75% per annum (2004, 2.7%), salary increases of 3.75% per annum (2004, 3.7%) and a discount rate for 
liabilities of 4.75% per annum (2004, 5.4%).

The cumulative amount of actuarial gains and losses recognised in the Group statement of recognised income and expense is 
£14.0m (2004, £6.1m) since 1 January 2004. The directors are unable to determine the amount of actuarial gains and losses 
that would have been recognised in the Group statement of recognised income and expense from the date of inception of the 
company schemes to 31 December 2003.
The Group estimates that the total value of contributions to defined benefit plans will be £3.2m in 2006, which is expected to 
include £1.8m of additional contributions to be paid over and above normal contributions.
Within Sweden, the Group operates a plan, included within a multiemployer plan, for its employees which is insured with Alecta. 
This scheme is a defined benefit plan, but Alecta is currently unable to provide sufficient information to report the Group’s 
proportional share of the defined benefit commitments and the assets under management and expenses associated with the 
plan. Consequently, Alecta cannot provide the information regarding the Group’s proportional share of the surplus or deficit in the 
plan. As a result the scheme is reported as if it were a defined contribution plan, although it is actually a defined benefit plan.

 37 Transition to IFRS (continued)
(a)  Discontinued operations
Under UK GAAP , revenue, operating profit and the gain/loss on disposal of businesses were shown separately for discontinued 
operations. The loss on disposal of £13.8m was calculated after adding back £17.4m of goodwill that had previously been written 
off against reserves. Any taxation cost in respect of discontinued operations was included within the taxation charge on the face 
of the primary statement. 
Under IFRS the disclosure of operating profit, the gain/loss on disposal, and the taxation relating to discontinued operations are 
shown in aggregate on the primary statement. However, there is also a change to the results for the year under IFRS, as goodwill 
previously written off against reserves is not written back on the disposal of a business, increasing the result for the year by 
£17.4m.

(b)  Goodwill amortisation
Under UK GAAP , the Group amortised goodwill over 20 years resulting in a charge in 2004 of £11.3m before deferred tax (£8.5m 
after crediting deferred tax), of which £11.2m related to continuing operations. Under IFRS, goodwill is not amortised but is tested 
for impairment both annually and when there are indications that the carrying value may not be recoverable.
£29.6m has been reclassified from goodwill to intangible assets in accordance with the transition to IFRS 3. This is partly offset 
by an £8.0m adjustment which increases goodwill in respect of deferred taxation of the intangible assets to be amortised. The 
net adjustment to goodwill is a reduction of £10.4m.

(c)  Acquired intangible assets
Under UK GAAP the Group did not separately identify acquired intangible assets from goodwill. Under IFRS, £29.6m of acquired 
intangible assets, including patents, trade secrets and trade marks are recognised separately from goodwill, capitalised at fair 
value and amortised over their estimated economic useful lives. The amortisation charge in 2004 was £1.2m (and £0.8m after 
tax) and results in a balance of £28.4m as at 31 December 2004.
(d)  Share based payments
Under UK GAAP no expense was recognised for equity settled share based remuneration. Under IFRS an expense is recognised 
and is based on the fair value as determined by reference to appropriate option pricing models for all such share based 
remuneration granted after the transition date of 7 November 2002. A prior year adjustment to the balance sheet as at 1 January 
2004 of £0.6m of deferred tax in respect of share based payments, was necessary. There is a charge in 2004 resulting in a 
reduction in profit before tax of £0.8m and £0.5m net of taxation for the 2004 financial year.

Under UK GAAP , deferred taxation was not charged on property revaluation surpluses but it is accounted for under IFRS. There is 
no impact on the income statement as any charge or credit is recorded in the Statement of Recognised Income and Expense.
An additional £8.2m of deferred tax liabilities also arise from the reclassification of elements of goodwill to specific intangible 
assets, in accordance with IFRS 3.

(f) Dividends
Under UK GAAP , dividends are accrued on the balance sheet when they are proposed by the Board. Under IFRS dividends 
declared after the balance sheet date are not recognised as a liability at the balance sheet date. Therefore, only dividends 
approved in 2004, equivalent to those paid in the period, are charged in 2004 with the result that the final proposed dividend in 
respect of 2003 amounting to £8.0m is added back to Equity Shareholders’ Funds at 1 January 2004 and £9.5m is added back 
at 31 December 2004 in respect of the final proposed dividend of 2004.
(g)  Research and development
The Group did not capitalise research and development expenditure under UK GAAP . Under IFRS, the Group will be required to 
capitalise development expenditure if certain criteria, which will include assessing that projects are commercially viable and that 
the same has been documented, have been met. No adjustment is necessary for 2004 as the required documentation was not in 
place, but development expenditure on a number of projects have been capitalised in 2005.
(h)  Financial instruments
IAS 32 (Financial Instruments: Disclosure and Presentation), and IAS 39 (Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement) 
were adopted on 1 January 2005. For the year ended 31 December 2004 there is no impact on the financial statements. 
However, between 31 December 2004 and 1 January 2005 there was a £0.4m reduction in Equity Shareholders’ Funds to reflect 
transitional adjustments in respect of fair value. 80 The Laird Group PLC

The following statement, which should be read in conjunction with the report of the independent auditors set out on page 85, is 
made with a view to distinguishing for shareholders the respective responsibilities of the directors and of the auditors in relation to the 
accounts.
The directors are required by the Companies Act 1985 to prepare accounts for each financial year which give a true and fair view of the 
state of affairs of the Company as at the end of the financial year and of the profit or loss of the Company for the financial year.
The directors consider that in compiling the accounts on pages 86 to 98, which have been prepared on a going concern basis, the 
Company has used appropriate accounting policies, consistently applied and supported by reasonable and prudent judgements and 
estimates and that all accounting standards which they consider to be applicable have been followed.
The directors have responsibility for ensuring that the Company keeps accounting records which disclose with reasonable accuracy the 
financial position of the Company which enable them to ensure that the accounts comply with the Companies Act 1985.
The directors have general responsibility for taking such steps as are reasonably open to them to safeguard the assets of the Company 
and to prevent and detect fraud and other irregularities.
The directors, having prepared the accounts, note that the auditors are required by the Companies Act 1985 to take whatever steps and 
undertake whatever inspections they consider to be appropriate for the purpose of enabling them to give their audit report.
Statement of directors’ responsibilities
in relation to the accounts The Laird Group PLC 85
We have audited the parent company financial statements of The Laird Group PLC for the year ended 31 December 2005 which comprise 
the Balance Sheet and the related notes 1 to 15. These parent company financial statements have been prepared under the accounting 
policies set out therein. We have also audited the information in the Directors’ remuneration report that is described as having been audited. 
We have reported separately on the Group financial statements of The Laird Group PLC for the year ended 31 December 2005.
This report is made solely to the Company’s members, as a body, in accordance with Section 235 of the Companies Act 1985. Our 
audit work has been undertaken so that we might state to the Company’s members those matters we are required to state to them in 
an auditors’ report and for no other purpose. To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility to anyone 
other than the Company and the Company’s members as a body, for our audit work, for this report, or for the opinions we have formed.
Respective responsibilities of directors and auditors
The directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report, the Directors’ remuneration report and the parent company financial 
statements in accordance with applicable United Kingdom law and Accounting Standards (United Kingdom Generally Accepted 
Accounting Practice) as set out in the Statement of Directors’ Responsibilities.
Our responsibility is to audit the parent company financial statements and the part of the Directors’ remuneration report to be audited in 
accordance with relevant legal and regulatory requirements and International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland).
We report to you our opinion as to whether the parent company financial statements give a true and fair view and whether the parent 
company financial statements and the part of the Directors’ remuneration report to be audited have been properly prepared in accordance 
with the Companies Act 1985. We also report to you if, in our opinion, the Directors’ report is not consistent with the parent company 
financial statements, if the Company has not kept proper accounting records, if we have not received all the information and explanations 
we require for our audit, or if information specified by law regarding directors’ remuneration and other transactions is not disclosed.
We read other information contained in the Annual Report and consider whether it is consistent with the audited parent company 
financial statements. The other information comprises only the Directors’ report, the unaudited part of the Directors’ remuneration report, 
the Chairman’s statement, the Chief Executive’s report and review, the Finance Director’s report and the Corporate governance report. 
We consider the implications for our report if we become aware of any apparent misstatements or material inconsistencies with the 
parent company financial statements. Our responsibilities do not extend to any other information.
Basis of audit opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland) issued by the Auditing Practices Board. 
An audit includes examination, on a test basis, of evidence relevant to the amounts and disclosures in the parent company financial 
statements and the part of the Directors’ remuneration report to be audited. It also includes an assessment of the significant estimates 
and judgments made by the directors in the preparation of the parent company financial statements, and of whether the accounting 
policies are appropriate to the Company’s circumstances, consistently applied and adequately disclosed.
We planned and performed our audit so as to obtain all the information and explanations which we considered necessary in order 
to provide us with sufficient evidence to give reasonable assurance that the parent company financial statements and the part of the 
Directors’ remuneration report to be audited are free from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or other irregularity or error. In 
forming our opinion we also evaluated the overall adequacy of the presentation of information in the parent company financial statements 
and the part of the Directors’ remuneration report to be audited.
Opinion
In our opinion:
�  the parent company financial statements give a true and fair view, in accordance with United Kingdom Generally Accepted 
Accounting Practice, of the state of the Company’s affairs as at 31 December 2005; and
�  the parent company financial statements and the part of the Directors’ remuneration report to be audited have been properly 
prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 1985.

Parent company balance sheet
as at 31 December The Laird Group PLC 87
 1. Accounting policies
Basis of preparation
The accounts of The Laird Group PLC have been prepared under the historical cost convention in accordance with UK 
accounting principles (including applicable accounting standards).
Profit and loss
As permitted by the exemption in Section 230 of the Companies Act 1985 the Company has not presented its own profit and 
loss account. Details are set out in note 13.
Depreciation
Depreciation is calculated to write off the cost or valuation of fixed assets evenly over their expected useful lives, principally as 
follows:
Computer equipment  5 years or less
Motor vehicles   4 years
Other plant and machinery 13 years or less
A proportion of one year’s depreciation is charged in the year the asset comes into service or is sold.
Pensions
The service cost of providing retirement benefits to employees during the year is charged to the operating profit or loss in the 
year. The full cost of providing amendments to benefits in respect of past service and gains and losses arising on unanticipated 
settlements or curtailments are also charged to the operating profit or loss in the year. The expected return on the assets of 
the schemes during the year based on the market value of scheme assets at the start of the year and the expected increase in 
liabilities of the schemes are included within other finance (charges)/income. Differences between actual and expected returns on 
assets during the year are recognised in the statement of recognised gains and losses in the year together with differences from 
changes in assumptions. The deficit on defined benefit pension schemes, net of deferred tax, is reported on the balance sheet as 
the pension liability.
The effect of adopting FRS 26 was to recognise additional income of £8.3m based upon the movement in the fair values of 
financial instruments during the period. There was no material impact arising from the adoption of FRS 23.
Deferred taxation
Deferred tax is recognised in respect of all timing differences that have originated but which have not reversed at the balance 
sheet date where transactions or events have occurred at that date that will result in an obligation to pay more or a right to pay 
less or to receive more, tax subject to the following:
(a)  Deferred tax is not recognised on the revaluation of non-monetary assets such as property unless a binding sale agreement 
exists at the balance sheet date. Where rollover relief is available on an asset then deferred tax is in any case not recognised.
(b)  Deferred tax is not recognised on unremitted earnings of overseas subsidiaries unless dividends have been accrued as 
receivable or there is a binding agreement to distribute past earnings at the balance sheet date.
(c)  Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that they are regarded as recoverable. Assets are regarded as recoverable 
when it is regarded as more likely than not there will be suitable taxable profits from which the future reversal of the underlying 
timing differences can be deducted.
Foreign currency transactions
Foreign currency transactions are recorded at the exchange rate ruling on the date of transaction. Foreign currency assets and 
liabilities are translated at the rates of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date.
Notes to the financial statements of parent company
for the year ended 31 December 2005 88 The Laird Group PLC
 1. Accounting policies (continued)
Financial assets 
Debtors are the only category of financial assets held by the Company. Debtors are recognised and carried at the lower of their 
original invoiced value and recoverable amount. Where the time value of money is material, debtors are carried at amortised cost. 
Provision is made when there is objective evidence that the Company will not be able to recover balances in full. Balances are 
written off when the probability of recovery is assessed as being remote. The Company assesses at each balance sheet date 
whether a financial asset or group of financial assets is impaired. Gains and losses are recognised in income when the loans and 
receivables are derecognised or impaired. 
If there is objective evidence that an impairment loss on debtors carried at amortised cost has been incurred, the amount of the 
loss is measured as the difference between the asset’s carrying amount and the present value of estimated future cash flows 
(excluding future credit losses that have not been incurred) discounted at the financial asset’s original effective interest rate (i.e., 
the effective interest rate computed at initial recognition). The carrying amount of the asset is reduced, with the amount of the 
loss recognised in the profit and loss account.
If, in a subsequent period, the amount of the impairment loss decreases and the decrease can be related objectively to an event 
occurring after the impairment was recognised, the previously recognised impairment loss is reversed. Any subsequent reversal of 
an impairment loss is recognised in the profit and loss account, to the extent that the carrying value of the asset does not exceed 
its amortised cost at the reversal date.
Financial liabilities
All financial liabilities are initially recognised at fair value. Measurement after initial recognition is at amortised cost, with the 
changes in the carrying amount being taken through the profit and loss account.
Interest bearing loans and borrowings
All loans and borrowings are initially recognised at fair value less directly attributable transaction costs. After initial recognition, 
interest-bearing loans and borrowings are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method. Gains 
and losses arising on the repurchase, settlement or otherwise cancellation of liabilities are recognised respectively in finance 
income and finance expense.
Derivative financial instruments
The Company uses derivative financial instruments such as currency swap contracts and interest rate swaps to hedge its risks 
associated with foreign currency and interest rate fluctuations. From 1 January 2005, such derivative financial instruments are 
initially recognised at fair value on the date on which a derivative contract is entered into and are subsequently remeasured at fair 
value. Derivatives are carried as assets when the fair value is positive and as liabilities when the fair value is negative. 
The fair value of forward currency contracts is calculated by reference to current forward exchange rates for contracts with similar 
maturity profiles. The fair value of interest rate swap contracts is determined by reference to market values for similar instruments.
Any gains or losses arising from changes in the fair value of derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting are taken in the 
profit and loss account. 
Derivative financial instruments and hedging for the year ended 31 December 2004
The Company has taken advantage of the exemptions contained within the transitional provisions of FRS 25 and 26. 
Comparative amounts have been stated in accordance with UK GAAP , deferring the adoption of FRS 25 and 26 until 1 January 
2005. The previous accounting policy for financial instruments under UK GAAP was that forward foreign exchange contracts are 
used to hedge foreign currency exposures arising on committed future transactions in foreign currencies. The rates under such 
contracts are used to record the hedged item. Interest differentials on interest rate swaps are recognised by adjusting net interest 
payable on an accruals basis. Interest rate swaps are not revalued to fair value prior to maturity.
Share based payments
In accordance with the transitional provisions of FRS 20, the expense recognised in the Company profit and loss account relates 
to equity settled grants made after 7 November 2002 that had not vested on 1 January 2005.
The fair value of Long Term Incentive Plan (LTIP) shares awarded is estimated at the date of award, using a Monte Carlo 
simulation technique, taking into account the terms and conditions upon which the LTIP shares were awarded including market 
based performance conditions. The fair value of share options granted is estimated at the date of grant using a binomial lattice 
method of calculation, taking into account the terms and conditions upon which share options were granted. Non-market 
company performance conditions are not taken into account when estimating the fair value. 
For grants that ultimately do not vest charges previously made are reversed except that an expense is recognised for awards 
where vesting is conditional upon a market condition and these are treated as vesting irrespective of whether or not the market 
condition is satisfied, provided all the other performance conditions are satisfied. 
Notes to the financial statements of parent company (continued)
for the year ended 31 December 2005 The Laird Group PLC 89
 1. Accounting policies (continued)
At each balance sheet date before vesting, the cumulative expense is calculated, representing the extent to which the vesting 
period has expired and management’s best estimate of the achievement or otherwise of non-market conditions, the number of 
equity instruments that will ultimately vest or in the case of an instrument subject to a market condition, be treated as vesting as 
described above. The movement in cumulative expense since the previous balance sheet date is recognised in the profit and loss 
account, with a corresponding entry in equity.
Where the terms for an equity settled award are modified, as a minimum, an expense is recognised as if the terms had not 
been modified. In addition, an expense is recognised for any modification, which increases the total fair value of the share based 
payment, or is otherwise beneficial to the employee as measured at the date of modification.
In circumstances where the equity settled grant is cancelled or settled, it is treated as if it had vested on the date of cancellation 
or settlement, and any expense not yet recognised for the grant is recognised immediately. 
 Changes in accounting policy
The Company has adopted FRS 20, ‘Share-based payments’, FRS 21, ‘Events after balance sheet date’, FRS 23 ‘The Effects 
of Changes in Foreign Exchange Rates’ FRS 25, ‘Financial instruments – disclosure and presentation’ and FRS 26 ‘Financial 
Instruments: Measurement’. The adoption of these standards represents a change in accounting policy and the comparative 
figures have been restated where exemptions are not available.
The effect of adopting FRS 20 was to recognise an additional charge of £1.6m (2004, £0.8m) in the year based on the fair value 
of shares awarded and share options granted.
The effect of adopting FRS 21 was to recognise the final dividend for the year ended 31 December 2004 in the current year. The 
final proposed dividend for the current year of £10.3m will be recognised in the following year as it has yet to be approved by 
shareholders at the forthcoming AGM.
The effect of adopting the presentation requirements of FRS 25 are set out in note 7.
 Impact on financial statements
The 2004 accounts previously reported have been restated for the adoption of FRS 20, FRS 21 and FRS 26 as follows: ‘dividend 
accruals’ have decreased by £9.5m and a deferred tax asset of £0.9m on share based payments has been recognised. The net 
impact is that the loss for the year has decreased by £10.4m and ‘shareholders’ funds’ increased by £10.4m.
 2. Tangible assets
The fixed assets of the Company at a cost of £0.7m (2004 £0.5m) and accumulated depreciation of £0.5m (2004, £0.4m) are 
included above. There were additions of £0.2m and disposals of £nil during the year and depreciation in the year was £0.1m.

 11. Pension schemes
The Company operates three defined benefit schemes.
Approximately 45 (2004, 51) employees are members of these defined benefit schemes and these schemes have approximately 
1,200 (2004, 1,200) deferred and current pensioners. The employer contributions made to these schemes during the year was 
£5.9m (2004, £1.0m). The assets are held in separate trustee administered funds. Pension costs are assessed by independent 
actuaries, full actuarial valuations being made every three years using either the projected unit or attained age methods. The most 
recent actuarial valuations were made between January 2003 and January 2005.
The total assessed value of the schemes’ assets at 31 December 2005 at their market value is estimated at £66.8m 
(2004, £14.8m) and the liabilities estimated at £81.6m (2004, £20.6m). The resultant deficit in the schemes under FRS 17 
is £14.8m (2004, £4.9m). Since last year equity markets have risen, however this increase has not been sufficient to offset 
reductions in corporate bond yields and higher longevity assumptions for the schemes’ members which impact upon the value of 
discounted liabilities, resulting in a higher aggregate net pension liability. 
The market value of the schemes’ assets, the present value of the schemes’ liabilities and the net pension liability under FRS 17 
at 31 December were as follows:

 13. Shareholders’ funds (continued)
The investment in own shares are those held by the Company ESOP Trust as described on page 31 of the Directors’ 
remuneration report. At 31 December 2005 the Trust held 1,015,000 shares (2004, 1,015,000 shares) of which 913,700 relate 
to the Long Term Incentive Plan. The shares held by the Trust had a total market value at that date of £4.3m (2004, £3.2m).
A loss after taxation of £7.1m (2004, £5.6m) has been debited to the profit and loss account brought forward of the Company after 
debiting exchange losses of £6.2m (2004, £4.6m ) and crediting dividends from subsidiary undertakings of £1.8m (2004, £6.5m). 
Movements on equity not recognised in the profit and loss account were £11.0m. The profit and loss account brought forward 
at 1 January 2005 is after crediting prior year adjustments of £10.4m relating to dividends of £9.5m and deferred tax on share 
based payments of £0.9m. The special reserve of £55.5m was created by a transfer from the share premium account under High 
Court Sanction in December 1989. No profit and loss account is presented for the Company as permitted by section 230 of the 
Companies Act 1985.
 14. Contingent liabilities
At 31 December 2005 the Company had contingent liabilities as follows:
(a) guarantees in respect of US Private Placement loans of £32.3m (2004, £31.8m); and
(b) guarantees relating to the performance of contracts of subsidiary undertakings.
There are legal claims against the Company but none where the Board takes the view that it is likely that damages will be 
awarded against the Group which would have a materially adverse effect on its financial position. 
 15. Share based payments
The Directors’ remuneration report on page 26, sets out the general terms and conditions including vesting requirements for all 
share based payment schemes; the Long Term Incentive Plan (LTIP), the 1994 Share Option Scheme and the 2003 Executive 
Share Option Plans.
All share based payments are equity settled. An expense of £1.6m was recognised in the year (2004, £0.8m) before employer’s 
national insurance and was based on the fair value of the LTIP’s shares awarded and the share options granted.
The following table shows the number of LTIP awards including LTIP awards granted during the year.

222,873 shares) were recognised in accordance with FRS 20 and resulted in a charge against profits. The balance of the share 
options were granted prior to 7 November 2002 and do not result in a charge against profits in accordance with the provisional 
arrangements of FRS 20. The weighted average share price at the date of exercise for the options exercised was 353p (2004, 
337p). For the share options outstanding at 31 December 2005, the weighted average remaining contractual life is 4.3 years 
(2004, 5.7 years).  98 The Laird Group PLC

All shares in the table above were recognised in accordance with FRS 20 as noted above. The weighted average share price at 
the date of exercise for the options exercised was 345p. None were exercised in 2004. For the share options outstanding at 31 
December 2005, the weighted average remaining contractual life is 8.3 years (2004, 8.8 years). 194,000 options (2004, 194,000) 
in the price range 140p to 250p and 558,800 options (2004, 267,200) in the price range 251p to 343p are subject to the higher 
performance targets set out in the table on page 29 of the Directors’ remuneration report.
The fair value of LTIP shares awarded is estimated as at the date of award, using a Monte Carlo simulation technique, taking 
into account the terms and conditions upon which the LTIP’s shares were awarded including the market based performance 
conditions set out in the Directors’ remuneration report. 
The fair value of share options granted is estimated as at the date of grant using a binomial lattice method of calculation, 
taking into account the terms and conditions upon which share options were granted. The non-market company performance 
conditions set out in the Directors’ remuneration report are not taken into account when estimating the fair value. 
The weighted average fair value of LTIP shares awarded during the year was 195p (2004, 177p) and of share options granted 
during the year was 108p (2004, 92p).
The following table lists the inputs to the valuation models for the years ended 31 December 2004 and 31 December 2005.

  Weighted average share price   342.5 287.3 342.5 287.3
The expected life of the share based payments is based on historical data and is not necessarily indicative of exercise patterns 
that may occur. 
The expected volatility of the LTIP shares is based on historical volatility; average of monthly activity over the last three years. 
Expected volatility reflects the assumptions that the historical volatility is indicative of future trends, which may not necessarily 
prove to be the actual outcome. Dividends are not payable on the LTIP shares prior to vesting and this is taken into account in 
calculating the fair value. 
For the share option schemes, no allowance is considered necessary for leavers pre-vesting.

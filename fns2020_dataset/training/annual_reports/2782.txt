2 Cambrian Mining Plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2008
After five years of rapid growth the past year was one of
consolidation for Cambrian. Our acquisition of Coal
International Plc was launched during the 2008 financial year,
but completed on 1 August 2008. Cambrian is now a focussed
mining company owning 100% of three individual mining
operations and 50% of one other producing thermal coal,
metallurgical coal, gold and antimony. In addition, we continue
to be the major shareholder in Western Canadian Coal Corp.
(‘WCCC’) and, through it, have a 42.96% (34.4% fully diluted)
interest in three metallurgical coal mines and two processing
plants in North East British Columbia.
We have faced many challenges since our inception in 2002,
not the least of which has been assembling a team of
professionals to consolidate our early entrepreneurial success,
and provide a sound platform for the future. In July 2007,
the Board appointed Mark Burridge as Chief Executive to
lead the Group through a strategic change process. Mark
has built an experienced team to overcome the financial and
management challenges that continually face a group
operating on three continents.
Cambrian’s Financial Statements are extensive and complex.
The 2008 Financial Statements were materially affected by
International Financial Reporting Standards (‘IFRSs’) revaluation
requirements in relation to derivative instruments. These
instruments include warrants and conversion options attached
to certain loans and debentures that Cambrian has advanced
to some of Cambrian’s associates as well as to its own $27
million convertible loan notes and those issued by associates.
The revaluation of these derivative instruments does not have a
cash flow effect and the accounting treatment is explained in
more detail in the Financial Review and in Note 1 to the
accounts.
We are pleased with the results for 2008 Financial Year, which
show the Group generating a £29.2 million profit from
continuing operations before exceptional derivative
revaluations and tax.
Chairman’s Statement
John Byrne
Executive Chairman In addition to the corporate development programme,
Cambrian has continued to provide financial, strategic and
corporate support to all our group companies and associates
enabling the operations teams to progress fully their
expansion plans.
The review and restructuring process has taken longer
than anticipated, but I am pleased to report that it is
nearing completion. In recent weeks, the process has been
complicated by the sharp deterioration in the world economy.
This has had a significant impact on the market value of
all companies.
However, our West Virginian operation has firm pricing
and a solid order book through to December 2009 and WCCC
has contracted all its output at very high prices through to April
2009. The anticipated strong cash flows from these operations
place Cambrian in a robust position for the future, and we
are optimistic that the decisive government intervention
will underpin the global economy and worldwide growth in
demand for our products.
I would like to thank all of our employees for their tireless
commitment to the growth of our Group and acknowledge
the support of my fellow board members.
John Byrne
Executive Chairman

Cambrian Mining Plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2008 3
The key transactions undertaken and objectives met by the
Group were the sale of Falls Mountain Coal Inc to Western
Canadian Coal Corp., assisting the refinancing and ongoing
strategic review of WCCC; acquiring the outstanding share
capital in Coal International Plc; continuing to develop our
gold/antimony mine at Costerfield, Australia; the disposal of our
interests in Asian Mineral Resources (‘AMR’); and, preparation
to divest our interest in Xtract Energy Plc (‘Xtract’).
Our operations have continued to expand in West Virginia, in the
United States, through Western Canadian Coal Corp. in Canada
and at Costerfield in Australia. The West Virginia coal operations
(‘Atlantic Development & Coal’) are on track to increase coal
production in the 2009 financial year. Through the acquisition
of Coal International Plc we now hold over 50% of Energybuild
Group Plc (‘Energybuild’).
During this expansion programme, safety has remained a key
priority and I would like to congratulate all the operating teams
for their excellent safety records, which have been recognised
in Western Canada and West Virginia through industry awards.
This year we undertook a Strategic Review which was
completed in April 2008. The objectives of the Review were
to address the following:
• Simplify Cambrian’s structure and clarify its
corporate objectives;
• Unlock value traps and build a platform to create
further value; and
• Capitalise on the current environment for coal and
gold prices.
The first strand of the Strategic Review was to acquire 100%
of Coal International Plc by way of a scheme of arrangement.
This was successfully completed in August 2008.
The second strand of the Strategic Review was to maximise
the value of our interest in WCCC. We have participated in a
strategic review process which has been undertaken by WCCC
with the assistance of Morgan Stanley. At the time of writing,
this process is still ongoing.
The third strand of the Strategic Review resulted in a
decision to distribute a majority of our Xtract shares to our
shareholders by way of a dividend in specie. Whilst this
remains our intention, the timing is under review in light
of the current market conditions. 4 Cambrian Mining Plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2008

Identify
The Group actively assesses opportunities to grow its
activities both through acquisition and organic
growth. The Group has identified a number of
opportunities over time including Western Canadian
Coal Corp, Ivernia West Inc, Aztec Resources, Asian
Mineral Resources and Energybuild Group. One such
example is where the Group identified WCCC as a
company holding coal leases with potential to produce
significant volumes of metallurgical coal as well as
being uniquely placed to utilise significant
infrastructure developed in the region in the 1980’s.
This existing infrastructure allowed WCCC to avoid the
cost of developing shipping and rail capacity and to
avoid the constraints experienced by a number of
other coal producers around the world. Cambrian Mining Plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2008 7 8 Cambrian Mining Plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2008
Develop
The Group has been instrumental in the past three
years in supporting the development of a number
of mines and moving them into production. These
include: the Augusta gold and antimony mine in
Victoria, Australia; the Wolverine hard coking coal
mine in Western Canada; the Dillon and Brule PCI
mines in Western Canada as well as metallurgical
and thermal coal mines in West Virginia, USA.
A number of mining opportunities were identified
for expanded production of both thermal and
metallurgical coal. The Group was involved in each
stage of the development from initial mine planning,
budgeting through to equipment sourcing and finance
(both internal and third party finance). Once the
development phases have been commenced, the
Group continues to monitor the operations to ensure
ongoing development is maintained and further
opportunities are considered. Cambrian Mining Plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2008 9 Grow
10 Cambrian Mining Plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2008
In order to optimise opportunities it is necessary to
grow operations to match demand and reduce costs
through economies of scale. Year on year production
has grown in West Virginia, Western Canada and
Australia. In West Virginia, following the rehabilitation
of the existing coal preparation plants and old
underground workings in 2007 it was possible to grow
the operations from a zero production base to the
2008 financial year production levels of 1 million tons
per annum. Growing shareholder value through
optimisation of existing operations and through
acquisitions is a key strength of the Group. Cambrian Mining Plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2008 11 12 Cambrian Mining Plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2008
CEO and Business Review
This year has seen Cambrian successfully launch the process
of transforming into an operating mining Group.
Subsidiary and associate operations all demonstrated progress in
terms of production growth. During the year overall coal sales
increased by 84% from 2,253,000 tonnes to 4,140,000 tonnes.
Antimony – gold concentrate production increased by 168%
from 1,033 tonnes to 2,772 tonnes.
T aking into account our share of associate results the Group’s
continuing operations made a £29.2 million profit before
exceptional derivative revaluations and tax and an after tax loss
of £0.5 million. A more detailed analysis is set out on pages 19 to
22 of the Financial Review.
The acquisition of Coal International Plc although completed on
1 August 2008 represented one of the key steps for Cambrian
in consolidating the status of the Group as a mining operator.
This acquisition resulted in the West Virginian properties
becoming 100% owned by Cambrian as well as increasing our
direct holding of Energybuild Group Plc an anthracite coal
producer in South Wales, from 27.50% to 50.6%.
The other key transaction during the year was the sale of Falls
Mountain Coal Inc (‘FC’) to Western Canadian Coal Corp.
As a result of this transaction, Cambrian’s holding in WCCC is
42.96% (34.4% fully diluted) as at 30 June 2008.
Other steps relating to Cambrian’s focus on core assets were
the disposal, in September 2007, of its interest in Asian Mineral
Resources generating proceeds of £10.7 million and Vulcan
Resources, in December 2007 and May 2008, generating
proceeds of £2.0 million.
During the year as well as continuing to grow our operations,
we also embarked on a strategic change programme to
transform the Company into an operating mining group.
Mark Burridge
Chief Executive Officer Cambrian Mining Plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2008 13
This corporate activity has been running in parallel with
developing the Company’s systems, controls and governance.
The Corporate Governance statement appears on pages 28 to
29. Alongside this, significant resource has been devoted to
improving the financial reporting systems this year to allow
Cambrian to report more effectively to its shareholders and
between the operations and corporate functions. On 1 August
2008, Braam Jonker joined the Cambrian team as full-time
Chief Financial Officer. He will continue to focus on these
projects and further develop Cambrian’s financial strategy.
While, like all companies in the sector, Cambrian’s fortunes are
impacted by changing macro-economic conditions, the Group
is well positioned to increase production in the 2009 Financial
Year. We have coal contracts in place that should mean we realise
higher revenues than last year as well as favourable margins.
Also, recent currency movements, if sustained, will also work
to our advantage as should reduced cost inflation due to low oil
and steel prices. Importantly, we have significant operating
flexibility in terms of being able to adjust our capital programmes,
production levels and product mix to adapt to changes in the
economic environment. Management are currently analysing a
number of scenarios to ensure that we can respond effectively to
changing conditions.
Next year, as well as optimising value from existing opportunities
and completing the key steps in our strategic change programme,
we will also examine selective opportunities for external growth.

See table on the facing page
Gauley Eagle, West Virginia, USA
Underground and Surface
The 17,000 acres Gauley Eagle property produces thermal and
metallurgical coal from the underground Silo Mains mine and
the Crooked Run surface mine. Coal is washed at the Gauley
Eagle coal preparation plant and is shipped via truck, barge and
rail to utility and industrial clients throughout the east and
south eastern United States.
Gauley Eagle surface and underground activities produce both
metallurgical and thermal coal. In the year to 30 June 2008,
120,000 tons of metallurgical coal were produced. Marketable
thermal coal production for the year to June 2008 totalled
585,000 tons, including 44,800 tons of third-party coal
washed and sold by Atlantic Leaseco. This production is sold
under a range of short and medium term contracts with selling
prices increasing throughout the year as older fixed-price
contracts have expired and been replaced by new contracts
reflecting higher market prices.
Coal production in the financial year to 30 June 2009 will
migrate from the current Silo Mains underground and Crooked
Run surface operations to new reserve blocks as resources
in the current project areas are depleted. Permitting is
substantially completed and construction activities commenced
to establish the new Black Pearl underground mine, which will
utilise the underground equipment currently in use at Silo
Mains. Production will be from the same Kittanning
C Seam as Silo Mains which has found strong acceptance in
both thermal and metallurgical markets.
Final permitting to establish the Lower Muddlety surface mine
at Gauley Eagle is near completion. The existing spread of
surface equipment operating the Crooked Run mine will transfer
to the Lower Muddlety project upon completion of mining at
Crooked Run. As the project is developed, a second surface
mining spread will be established. Production will come from
the Kittanning C, Widen and Mearns seams and will be sold
to both the thermal and metallurgical markets.
Maple Coal, West Virginia, USA
Surface
The Maple Coal property contains significant thermal coal
reserves, accessible with surface mining methods. In response
to strengthening thermal coal prices early in 2008, efforts
commenced to establish the Sycamore South surface mine at
Maple. The first spread of surface equipment was installed in
June 2008, with first production sold in July. A second spread
of equipment is currently being mobilised and will bring surface
production to approximately 60,000 tons per month by
calendar year end 2008.
CEO and Business Review continued
Group Health, Safety and Environment
Cambrian is committed to ensuring a safe working environment
is provided in all aspects of operations within the Group’s
structure. The safety policy and procedures of our operating
associate companies are achieving commendable results
in safety.
A notable achievement this year is the award of the ‘Joseph A.
Holmes Safety Association Award’ by the Governor of the State
of West Virginia to the Gauley Eagle Mine for its impressive
performance in safety. The West Virginian operations reported
four lost time injuries across all sites during the year. The Non-
Fatal Days Lost (‘NFDL’) rate (calculated as the rate of lost time
injuries per 200,000 man-hours worked) for the total man-
hours worked in the six-month period ended 30 June 2008 was
3.40, which is just above the NFDL national average of 3.25 for
the corresponding period. Since the year end our West Virginian
operations have received two further safety awards
WCCC continued to prove its excellence in safety when the
Burnt River property was awarded the ‘John T. Ryan Safety
Award’, in recognition of being one of the safest coal mining
operations in Canada. There have been no lost time accidents
recorded from the beginning of the project. WCCC recorded
three lost time injuries over the financial year, combining all
mining and construction activities at the Wolverine group
of mines and the Willow Creek property.
Our gold and antimony mining operation in Australia is
committed to safety and has implemented safety policy and
procedures to ensure the safe operation of the mine and
processing plant. AGD recorded four lost time incidents for this
financial year. Although this was an improvement on the five
lost time incidents recorded for the same period the previous
year, we believe we can improve on AGD’s safety record.
The Group is committed to mining in an environmentally safe
and sustainable way. We identify and implement best practice
to reduce pollution, comply with environmental legislation
and we maintain management systems to a high standard to
ensure that environmental incidents are limited in number
and dealt with effectively and quickly if they occur.
Group Employment
The Group has expanded over the course of the year both
through organic growth and acquisitions. As at 30 September
2008, there were 246 employees in West Virginia, 77*
in Australia, 198 in Wales, over 600* in Canada and 14
employees in the corporate head office in London.
The Group values the contribution of all of its employees and
strives to maintain a competitive remuneration structure at
each operation as well as maintaining high levels of safety
and training for each individual.
*including contractors Cambrian Mining Plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2008 15
Maple Coal, West Virginia, USA
Underground
The 2008 Financial Year has focused on expanding the
production base to take best advantage of the market for
metallurgical coal. In early 2008 a second continuous mine unit
was established in the Eagle Seam and a third unit is currently
being brought into production. Production ramped up
throughout the year despite the requirement to perform
substantial underground construction and remediation to old
works. This mine produced 282,000 marketable tons in the
year to 30 June 2008. All of Maple’s production was sold into
the domestic and international metallurgical coal market at an
average price of $88 per ton range for older contracts to
prices at a highest price of $195 per ton for current business.
With the completion of underground construction providing
sufficient working space for the third continuous miner unit,
underground production capacity is expected to ramp-up to
approximately 900,000 tons per year. Work to expand the
capacity of the Katie preparation plant to handle the increased
production is near completion.

Nant y Mynydd, South Wales, UK
Surface
Overall opencast activities have produced 70,000 tonnes of
thermal coal in the year at an average selling price of £65 per
tonne. The Nant y Mynydd site was a higher ratio coal site than
anticipated resulting in operational inefficiencies. A delay to
commencement of sandstone activities in the year resulted in
reduced revenue from operations and increased costs, as the
coal seam beneath would have been produced at marginal cost.
Planning consent was received for a new site with lower coaling
ratios in November 2007 and production commenced in
February 2008 at an average of 2,000 tonnes per week.
Sandstone operations are now expected to commence in the
year ending 30 June 2009.
Opencast activities will continue, but will become less
important to Energybuild as production increases from the
drift mine. Production is estimated at approximately 100,000
tonnes from opencast operations in the 2009 financial year
from the Nant y Mynydd, Forest Quarry and continuity sites.
Although this is dependent upon planning consents, Energybuild
management are confident these will be obtained, due to
their positive record on restoration and rehabilitation of old
derelict sites.
Aberpergwm, South Wales, UK
Underground
Energybuild has successfully accessed the anthracite reserves
under its control in the year and an increase in production to
265,000 tonnes of clean coal in the year to 30 June 2009 is
expected. Further production increases are expected with
440,000 tonnes and 750,000 tonnes of clean coal targeted for
the years to 30 June 2010 and 2011 respectively.
Energybuild produced approximately 30,000 tonnes of clean
thermal coal from the 18ft seam in the period to 30 June 2008
at an operating cost of £73 per tonne. Of that tonnage 13,600

tonnes has been sold at an average price of £82 per tonne with
the balance in inventory at 30 June 2008. Recovering the old
British Coal intake and return drifts across the Pentreclwydau
fault into the 18ft seam was achieved in September 2007 – on
time and within budget. In February 2008 the air circuit in the
seam was completed and mining started in March 2008.
A significant amount of work has taken place on the mine
surface and equipment procurement in order to cater for the
increased production forecast over the next two years.
An important stage of the development of the mine will be
driving the new drift which received full planning consent
in July 2008. This drift will increase the ventilation capacity
of the mine and assist in reducing production costs, due to
the efficiencies it will bring in terms of coal clearance, material
handling and conveying men to production areas faster.
Western Canadian Coal Corporation
See table above
Total metallurgical coal production at Wolverine and Brule
during the year ended 30 June 2008 was 2,823,000 tonnes.
Coal sales for the corresponding period were 2,997,000
tonnes with an average price achieved of US$108 per tonne.
Wolverine, British Columbia, Canada
Surface
The Perry Creek property started production in 2006. The last
remaining major initial capital project item, the mine equipment
maintenance services (shop and warehouse) complex, was
occupied in March 2008. In June 2008 WCCC obtained a Mine
Permit allowing for coal production from the Wolverine mine
of 3,000,000 tonnes per annum, utilising the design capacity
of the preparation plant.
Shipments continued to major steel mills in Asia and Europe.
Testing of coal samples at the loading port from these vessels
indicates that coal quality from Wolverine continues to meet
or exceed the high expectations identified during pre-
production tests.
Clean coal production to 30 June 2008 has averaged 156,600
tonnes per month, which is below the targeted production of
175,000 tonnes per month. Productivity has been constrained
by the shortage of skilled operators and tradesmen. WCCC
continues to address the impact of skilled labour shortages
CEO and Business Review continued
(endemic to the industry and to north eastern British Columbia),
including intensive recruiting efforts and training programmes.
WCCC believes that these issues can be overcome and
improvements in production are being seen, with the
expectation that production levels will meet targets through to
year ending 31 March 2009.
No significant issues have arisen with respect to coal quality and
the plant processing capabilities have exceeded expectations.
For the year ending 31 March 2009, coal production from
the Wolverine mine has been fully committed and WCCC is
projecting coal shipments of approximately 2,000,000 tonnes
of coal from the Wolverine mine, comprising 1,800,000 tonnes
of coking coal and 200,000 tonnes of mid-volatile PCI coal.
Brule (Burnt River), British Columbia, Canada
Surface
The Brule mine produces Ultra Low Volatile Pulverised Coal
Injection (‘ULV-PCI’) coal for export, primarily to Korea. ULV-
PCI coal can replace up to 30% of the coke feed in the blast
furnace, resulting in significantly reduced raw material costs
for steel makers. 1,090,000 tonnes of ULV-PCI coal from the
Brule mine was sold in the year 1 April 2007 to 31 March 2008.
Initial mining at Brule is being conducted with no coal processing
beyond crushing, and planned production of approximately
1,200,000 tonnes per annum. This plan requires minimal
capital investment and involves mining high quality coal from
low strip ratio portions of the Brule deposit.
The 2005 feasibility study for Brule demonstrated that
additional initial capital for a new wash plant, site infrastructure,
coal-haul route and new load-out of C$144 million was
required, as well as C$70 million worth of additional mining
equipment in order to increase annual production to 2,000,000
tonnes. Due to the FMC acquisition, WCCC has access to an
existing wash plant and rail load-out facility, which will result in
a reduction of about C$70 million in capital costs included in the
original estimate. Refurbishment and upgrading of the
Willow Creek wash plant has begun. Design and permitting
work is under way on road upgrading, with construction
planned during calendar year 2009 to allow current Brule
production to be diverted from the Bullmoose rail load-out to
the closer Willow Creek load-out facility. Application has been
made to the Environmental Assessment Office to amend the
Environmental Assessment (‘EA’) certificate to allow coal haul
via highway to Willow Creek as an interim measure.

All gold and antimony concentrates produced were sold
under contract to the Hunan Zhongnan Tungsten and Trading
Company, an antimony smelting company in China. Antimony
prices averaged A$6,570 per tonne and the gold price
averaged A$934.40 per ounce.
The Augusta drilling campaign was successful. The results
indicate the Augusta vein system extends north of the known
mineralisation and continues at depths below the previously
known depth. Drilling also intercepted a previously-unknown
mineralised structure in the hanging wall of the W lode.
A revised mineral resource estimate based on the drilling and
underground sampling data has been prepared by Fredericksen
Geological Solutions as at 30 June 2008 and suggests there are
sufficient resources to support a minimum five year mine life
for the Augusta deposit at the targeted mine production rate
of 65,000 tonnes of ore annually. The revised estimate is
331,000 tonnes with an average content of 11.4g gold per
tonne and antimony of 6.1%.
Exploration of the Brunswick deposit was suspended while
the potential of Augusta was assessed. Data from the previous
year’s drilling programme on the Brunswick deposit was
utilised by AMC Consultants to prepare a resource estimate.
This estimate is 157,100 tonnes with an average content
of 7.1g gold per tonne and antimony of 3.8%.
Due to drilling success, AGD is currently analysing plans to
extend the mining operations down to 15 level (152 metres
below the surface) versus the previously planned 10 level.
Depending on the outcome of this study we will make some
decisions regarding the future of AGD.
Energy and Resources Technology
Our Strategic Review identified that Xtract has a promising
future and that it should create significant value for its
shareholders, but we also recognise that Xtract’s structure and
focus on developing early-stage energy assets is no longer
compatible with our strategic direction as an operating Group. It
was therefore decided to dividend a significant portion of the
holding directly to our shareholders. Whilst we expected this to
happen prior to December 2008, the current market turmoil and
our desire to return real value to our shareholders has resulted in
Cambrian’s sale of FMC to WCCC should allow WCCC to
enhance its ULV-PCI coal production through a combination of
cost savings at Brule and increased metallurgical coal
production at Willow Creek.
AGD Mining
See table above
Costerfield, Australia
Gold and antimony mine
AGD continued development of its Costerfield
gold and antimony mine and treatment plant in central
Victoria, Australia. Development of the operations was
financed with proceeds from the sales of shareholdings in
Asian Mineral Resources and Vulcan Resources.
The Augusta mine continued to advance toward its
annual planned production rate of 65,000 tonnes of gold and
antimony ore. Prices for both metals firmed during the year but
the extent of the benefit for AGD was moderated by an
increase in the value of the Australian dollar against the US
dollar, in which the metals are priced. Subsequent to the year
end the Australian dollar has weakened and therefore the
results for AGD have improved.
The mine experienced a series of setbacks to the production
schedule during the year including more difficult ground
conditions in the upper level of the mine, equipment shortages
and a lack of skilled personnel. These issues began to be
addressed in the course of the year and a number of measures
were implemented, including increased investment in mine
equipment and training, and AGD taking over direct
management of the mining operations from its mine contractor.
As a result of these changes, production rates showed a gradual
improvement over the year and this has continued with
production increasing from 7,750 tonnes in the first quarter
to September 2007 to 15,254 tonnes in the quarter ending
June 2008.
This year further improvements were made to the treatment
plant. Recovery of antimony metal in concentrate improved
to 82% while recovery of gold in concentrate and from the
gravity section of the plant rose to 79% compared with
antimony recovery of 69% and gold recovery of 52% during
the previous year.

IPO positions in the energy and related sectors. In July 2008,
Wasabi made an investment in Xtract through the purchase of
36.5 million shares and an equivalent numberof options from
Cambrian. Xtract currently holds 153 million shares in Wasabi,
representing approximately 19.4% of the issued capital.
Group Outlook
Cambrian expects to increase production and revenues
in the 2009 financial year.
In the current environment of financial and economic
uncertainty, there are a number of factors that may impact
on the business of the Group. However, Cambrian is well
positioned to deal with this environment from an operating
standpoint. While it appears likely that the price of coal may
decline on a spot basis, Cambrian will actually generate higher
revenues per tonne in the 2009 financial year than in 2008
due to higher price contracts being in place and increased
proportion of metallurgical coal. In West Virginia, the coal
contracts we have in place are expected to support our
ability to generate an operating cash margin.
The Group has significant flexibility in its operating plans to be
able to adjust production levels and product mix to respond to a
variety of economic scenarios, and management are actively
considering different plans to ensure that operating performance
is optimised. This flexibility also provides us with a competitive
advantage in terms of responding positively to any potential
regulatory changes in the USA regarding surface mining.
In general, while commodity prices are turning down, prices of
coal, gold and antimony, Cambrian’s key products, are currently
performing better than other commodities. The drop in oil
and steel prices, while reflective of the challenges that face
the industry in general, should result in material operating
cost reductions.
Cambrian’s operating margins will also benefit from the
recent strength in the US dollar against the Canadian, Australian
and British currencies. Due to exchange rate fluctuations
profit generated in US Dollars from the West Virginian Coal
Operations will result in increased Sterling results. Sales from
the Canadian and Australian operations are also denominated
in US dollars with underlying operating cost exposures in
currencies that have weakened significantly.
a delay. It is still the intention of the Company to dividend the
majority of its holding to shareholders in the near future.
MEO
Xtract has a 13.9% shareholding in MEO, a company focused
on developing gas-to-liquids (‘GTL’) projects in the Timor Sea,
on an area of shallow water known as Tassie Shoal, located
approximately 275km northwest of Darwin, Australia. MEO has
secured Australian Government environmental approvals which
are valid until 2052.
Elko
In September 2007, Xtract provided Elko Energy with
US$2 million of development equity through a private
placement. Elko’s exploration strategy aims to realise the
potential of its highly significant gas and oil assets in the Danish
and Dutch North Sea to maximise long term shareholder value.
In December 2007 another private placement took place in
which Xtract contributed a further US$6 million, maintaining its
ownership interest at 35.2% of the issued capital of Elko.
Elko operates the largest exploration licence in Denmark,
with an off-shore area of 1.3 million acres. The licence is held
80% by Elko and 20% by a Danish government entity. Elko
is committed to drilling at least one well on its Danish Licence,
with the addition of further wells as funding is secured. Elko
plans to farm out part of its 80% interest before moving ahead
with drilling the first exploratory well, which is projected to
cost approximately US$25 million. The development of the
very significant gas reserves on the Dutch blocks, clearly
identified through drilling, testing and extensive 3D seismic
coverage, remains Elko’s priority project.
Oil Shale
Through its wholly owned Australian subsidiary, Xtract is
pursuing a twin-track strategy to build its oil shale resource
base and to develop a proprietary oil shale technology
directed towards improving economic and environmental
performance compared with traditional technologies. The
mining and production of refinery feed-stock crude oil from
oil shale represents a potentially significant and valuable
source of hydrocarbon to help satisfy future international
energy demands.
Other Interests
Through its subsidiary companies, Xtract continues its oil and gas
exploration, development and production programmes in the
Kyrgyz Republic. On 12 November 2008, Xtract announced that
it had completed the farm-in agreement with Santos International
Holdings Pty Ltd in relation to its subsidiary Zhibek Resources Ltd.

Financial Review
Braam Jonker
Chief Financial Officer
The 2008 Financial Year was both a successful and a
challenging period for the Cambrian finance team. Cambrian
engaged in various transactions during the year as part
of its Strategic Review. In addition, part of Cambrian’s
investments in WCCC and Coal International’s convertible debt
instruments are treated as derivatives in terms of IFRS.
These transactions combined with complex IFRS reporting
requirements on accounting for derivative instruments have
again resulted in a fairly complicated set of annual accounts
for Cambrian, which we explain below.
Income Statement
Cambrian reported a net loss of £1.4 million for the year,
from continuing operations. This included a £74.2 million loss
from associate WCCC, largely made up of a £63.2 million loss
related to the derivative components of its US$ denominated
convertible loan instruments.

(1) Exceptional derivative revaluations and the rationale for a 3 column income statement are discussed under derivatives below.
Revenue and cost of sales mainly relate to AGD’s development
activities. The increase in both revenue and costs are due to
an increase in the level of activity at the operations compared
to 2007.
Administration and other operating expenses/income are
£3.5 million less than in 2007. This is mainly due to a foreign
exchange loss of £1.3 million during the 2007 year compared
to a £0.7 million gain during the 2008 year and significant
one-off charges during the previous year.
Administration and other operating expenses/income were
also affected by a £1.4 million increase in amortisation of
intangibles, a £1.0 million reduction in the share based
payments charge, and a £1.1 million increase in other employee
expenses, reflecting the increase in the Group’s workforce. 20 Cambrian Mining Plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2008
Exceptional derivative revaluation in the Income statement
Details of the effect of the derivative instruments on the
income statement for the year are set out in note 1 to the
accounts. The £46.9 million derivative gain comprises a
£55.0 million derivative gain on a Coal International Plc
convertible loan, WCCC convertible debentures, loan notes
and warrants held by the Group, partly off-set by a £8.1 million
derivative loss relating to Cambrian’s US $27.0 million
convertible loan notes. The tax on derivatives is deferred tax
and relates only to the net £46.9 million derivative gain.
The £63.2 million derivative loss included in share of results
of associates relates to derivative instruments issued by
WCCC, on which there is no tax impact for either WCCC
or for Cambrian. None of the derivative gains and losses
was of a cash nature.
Derivative assets
The derivative instruments held by the Group on 30 June
2008 and their related receivable components are disclosed
in the balance sheet as shown below.
The £13.5 million convertible loan was issued by Coal
International during the 2007 financial year. The loan was
restructured following the acquisition of a 100% interest
in Coal International by Cambrian on 1 August 2008 and
it no longer has a derivative component (refer to note 36
for further detail).
Cambrian provided a C$5 million loan facility to WCCC on
13 September 2007. The loan is convertible at the discretion
of Cambrian at any time prior to maturity on 15 July 2011 at a
price of C$0.75 per share (refer to note 25 for further detail).
The C$29 million WCCC convertible debentures are quoted
on the Toronto Stock Exchange and are convertible at a price
of C$4.00 per share and can be redeemed by WCCC any time
after 24 March 2009 if the share price exceeds C$5.00. The
debentures mature on 24 March 2011.
The Group’s principal associates during the year were WCCC
and Coal International. The pre-exceptional derivative share
of associate losses increased from £7.7 million to £12.4 million
due to increased activity as the mines ramp up to target
production.
Other investments and financing gains for the year (excluding
exceptional derivative revaluations) mainly comprised:
• £37.7 million profit on the disposal of the Group’s interest
in FMC to WCCC, including a £6.1 million gain on the election
of shares instead of cash as the final payment.
The Falls Mountain investment was classified as assets
held for sale in the 2007 accounts;
• £4.7 million reversal of an impairment loss on the Group’s
Coal International investment (see note 19 for details); and
• £8.6 million profit on the disposal of various investments
during the year, of which £7.2 million and £0.5 million
relate to AMR and Vulcan respectively.
Derivatives
The Group held several derivative instruments at financial year-
end. In terms of IFRS, these instruments must be included in
the accounts at fair value and changes in these fair values are to
be accounted for through the income statement. Fair value
is determined using the binomial valuation model or where
applicable quoted market prices. Movements in the quoted
price of the underlying shares between initial recognition and
current valuation dates have the most significant impact on
these revaluations. At the start/finish of the 2008 financial
year the share prices of WCCC and Cambrian were C$2.76/
C$8.96 per share and 125.75p/ 274.5p respectively.
Following these increases, the share prices of WCCC and
Cambrian have declined after the financial year end, which
would lead to a reversal of most of the gains and losses
recorded in the 2008 annual results. Due to the material nature
of the derivative revaluations, we believe that showing these
results separately assists users of the accounts to gain a better
appreciation of the operating results of the Group.

During the year the Board expressed its intention to
divest Cambrian’s remaining interest in Xtract via a sale and/or
distribution to its shareholders as a dividend in specie. As a
result, Xtract’s assets and liabilities of £39.3 million and £9.7
million respectively
were included in the balance sheet as assets and liabilities held
for sale (see note 13 for detail). The year on year reduction
in intangible assets mainly relates to the reclassification of the
Xtract assets. On 1 July 2008, 4.9% of Cambrian’s interest
in Xtract was sold, resulting in Xtract becoming an associate
of the Group from that date.
On 3 August 2007 the Group acquired a 27.5% equity interest
in Energybuild through the issue of 4.3 million shares in the
Company and in lieu of an existing loan of £1.9 million due to the
Company. During the year, the Group also increased its equity
interest in Elko Energy from 31.6% to 35.2% at a cost of £4.1
million and acquired a further 17% in Wasabi through a share for
share swap by Xtract and a cash payment of £0.4 million.
The Group disposed of part of its investments in Wasabi and
MEO for £1.2 million and £8.5 million respectively and both
assets were transferred from interest in associate to available
for sale investments at a total value of £21.0 million (see note
19 for details). The Elko, Wasabi and MEO investments are
all held within Xtract.
The Group disposed of its interest in FMC to WCCC
for a total consideration of 18.7 million WCCC shares on
completion of the transaction and a deferred payment of either
4.5 million WCCC shares or a C$14.1 million (£7.0 million) cash
payment. This deferred consideration was recorded at market
value on 6 May 2008 (details provided in note 13). The Group
elected to receive the deferred payment as shares on 27 June
2008 and the derivative component valued at £12.6 million for
accounting purposes, was transferred from derivative
instruments to interest in associates upon receipt which,
together with the £7.0 million cash payment foregone,
increased associates by £19.7 million. In total, the FMC
transaction has increased the Group’s interest in associates by
£50.2 million, reducing the impact on the balance sheet of the
£63.2 million interest in derivative losses from associates (see
note 19 for details).
As at the balance sheet date, the Group’s associates
comprise WCCC, Coal International and Energybuild
(see note 19 for details).
Other non-current assets decreased during the period mainly
as a result of £17.2 million of available for sale assets held
at 30 June 2007 being sold during the period, and the transfer
to current receivables of the Coal International convertible loan
of £13.6 million.
Current assets increased significantly as a result of a
£25.1 million increase in held for sale assets relating to Xtracta
£57.8 million increase in the value of derivatives mostly relating
to WCCC (refer to note 25), and the transfer of the Coal
International convertible loan from non-current assets.
The Group’s current liabilities increased by £44.7 million year
on year, of which the transfer of loans and borrowings and
convertible loan notes from non-current liabilities to current
liabilities, accounted for £25.6 million. The revaluation of the
derivative component of the US$27.0 million convertible loan
notes issued by Cambrian and an increase
of £8.0 million in liabilities associated with Xtract, which was
classified as a held for sale asset at year end, accounted for
the remainder of the increase.
The Group’s borrowings and convertible loan notes totalling
£25.6 million fall due during the second half of the 2009
financial year. The Group is confident that it will be able
to settle these debt obligations through a combination of
operational cash flow, cash from investment activities and
a new or revised debt facility, if required.
Non-current liabilities decreased by £24.1 million, mainly due
to the reclassification of the loans and borrowings and loan
notes as discussed above. In total, the Group’s liabilities have
increased by £20.6 million year on year, mainly due to the
increase in Xtract’s liabilities and the fair value of the derivative
component of the US$27.0 million convertible loan notes.
Equity
During the year, the Group issued 5.25 million shares of
which 4.3 million related to the acquisition of Energybuild as
discussed above. The remainder was as a result of the exercise
of options by employees and former employees. Significant cash movements and liquidity

Financial Review continued
Cambrian’s cash position reduced from £5.8 million to
£2.0 million during the year. This is mainly due to the
reclassification of Xtract’s £6.4 million cash as assets held for
sale, partly offset by £1.6 million of positive exchange rate
changes and £1.0 million of net cash generated during the year.
The Group used £11.6 million in operating activities during
the 2008 financial year compared to £17.1 million during the
2007 financial year (see note 33 for details). The cash used
in operating activities was mainly affected by:
• £3.4 million increase in the loss at the AGD operations;
• £3.5 million lower administrative and other operating
expenses;
• £2.6million loss from discontinued operations, excluding
share in associates, compared to a loss of £1.6 million
during 2007;
• £8.3 million taxes paid during 2007, compared to £nil
during 2008; and
• £0.3 million increase in working capital in 2008, compared
to a £0.7 million reduction in working capital in 2007.
The Group generated £13.7 million from its investing activities
during 2008 on the back of £23.8 million sales proceeds from
the disposal of its interest in AMR, Wasabi, MEO and Vulcan.
This was partly offset by the £4.1 million acquisition of Elko
Energy shares by Xtract, a £0.4 million investment in Wasabi
by Xtract and a £4.5 million net increase in subscription to
convertible loan instruments and provision of loans to WCCC
and Coal International.
Cash used in financing activities was £1.1 million during 2008,
compared to £14.8 million proceeds generated from financing
activities during 2007. During 2007, the Group raised
£11.6 million in borrowings and a further £6.7 million through
the issue of shares by the Group’s listed subsidiaries to minority
shareholders, whilst no significant funds were raised
during 2008.
Post Balance Sheet Events
The details of the Group’s material post balance sheet events
are provided in note 36 to the accounts. The most significant of
the post balance sheet events is the acquisition by the Group
of a 100% equity interest in Coal International Plc through the
issue of 19.7 million Cambrian shares at a market value of
£0.8 million on 1 August 2008. As an indirect result of this
transaction, the Group’s interest in Energybuild increased to
50.59%.

Directors 24 Cambrian Mining Plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2008
Directors’ Report
The directors present their report together with the financial statements for the year ended 30 June 2008.
Principal Activities and Business Review
Cambrian is a diversified mining group that manages and supports operations in coal, gold and antimony mining. Cambrian has
been instrumental in the past three years in supporting the development of a number of mines and moving them into production.
These include: the Augusta gold and antimony mine in Victoria, Australia (through its wholly-owned subsidiary AGD Mining
Pty Ltd), the Wolverine hard coking coal mine and the Dillon and Brule PCI mines in Western Canada (through
its investment in WCCC) and an underground metallurgical coal and underground and surface thermal coal mines in
West Virginia, USA.
Cambrian also currently has an investment in Xtract, giving it exposure to energy projects and related technologies. However,
the directors have recognised that Xtract’s structure and focus on developing early-stage energy assets is no longer compatible
Cambrian’s strategic direction as an operating Group. It was therefore decided to dividend a significant portion of the holding
directly to our shareholders in the near future.
A detailed review of the Group’s business during the year and an indication of likely further developments may be found in the
Chairman’s Statement, (page 2) the CEO & Business Review, (page 12) and the Financial Review, (page 19).
The derivative financial instruments of the Group comprise options and warrants over quoted equity securities and options
embedded in the convertible debentures and notes of other entities held by the Group and the Company’s convertible notes
in issue. Details of the derivative financial instruments are set out in note 25 of the financial statements.
Risks and uncertainties are discussed on pages 28 and 29 of this Directors’ Report.
Results and Dividends
The net loss for the Group for the year ended 30 June 2008 amounts to £3.0 million (2007: £4.3 million).

Authority incorporate the Combined Code, which sets out the principles of Good Governance, and the Code of Best Practice for
listed companies. Whilst the Company is not required to comply with the Combined Code, the Company’s corporate governance

to optimise corporate performance and accountability.
The Board of Directors
The Board of directors currently comprises six members, three Executive Directors (Mark Burridge, John Byrne and John Conlon)
and three independent Non-Executive Directors (Ted Button, John O’Reilly and Charles de Chezelles).
Board Meetings
The Board meets regularly to provide effective leadership and overall management of the Group’s affairs through the schedule of
matters reserved for its decision. This includes the approval of the budget and business plan, major capital expenditure,
acquisitions and disposals, risk management policies and the approval of the financial statements. Formal agendas, papers and
reports are sent to the directors in a timely manner, prior to the board meetings. The Full Board met fifteen times during the
period. In addition, the Board delegates certain of its responsibilities to the Board Committees which have clearly defined terms
of reference. The Board Committees met eight times during the period.
All directors have access to the advice of the Company’s solicitors and the Company Secretary who is responsible for ensuring
that all Board procedures are followed. Any director may take independent professional advice at the Company’s expense in the
furtherance of his duties.
Board Committees
The Board has established Remuneration, Audit and Nomination Committees. The Remuneration Committee is responsible
for making recommendations to the Board on the Company’s framework for executive remuneration and its cost and for
determining, on the Board’s behalf, specific remuneration packages for directors, including pension rights and any compensation
payments. The Audit Committee is responsible for reviewing the scope and results of the annual audit, its cost effectiveness
and the auditors’ independence and objectivity. The Nomination Committee has responsibility for identifying, evaluating and
recommending candidates to join the Board and make recommendations on Board composition and balance.
The current members of the Remuneration Committee are Charles de Chezelles and John O’Reilly. The current members

Charles de Chezelles, Ted Button and John O’Reilly.
Securities Trading
The Board has adopted a share dealing code that applies to directors, senior management and any employee who is in possession
of ‘inside information’. All such persons are prohibited from trading in the Company’s securities if they are in possession of
‘inside information’. Subject to this condition and trading prohibitions applying to certain periods, trading can occur provided
the relevant individual has received the appropriate prescribed clearance.
Risks and Uncertainties
The principal risks facing the Company are set out below. Risk assessment and evaluation is an essential part of the Group’s
planning and an important aspect of the Group’s internal control system.
General and economic risks:
• Contractions in the world’s major economies or increases in the rate of inflation resulting from international conditions.
• Weakness in global equity and share markets in particular in Australia, Canada and the United Kingdom, and adverse changes
in market sentiment towards the resource industry.
• Currency exchange rate fluctuations and, in particular, the relative prices of the Australian Dollar, US Dollar, Canadian Dollar
and the UK Pound.
• Exposure to interest rate fluctuations. Cambrian Mining Plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2008 29
• Adverse changes in factors affecting the success of exploration and development operations, such as increases in expenses,
changes in government policy and further regulation of the industry; unforeseen major failure, breakdowns or repairs required
to key items of plant and equipment resulting in significant delays, not withstanding regular programmes of repair,
maintenance and upkeep; variations in grades and unforeseen adverse geological factors or prolonged weather conditions.
Funding risk:
• The Group or the companies in which it has invested may not be able to raise, either by debt or further equity, sufficient
funds to enable completion of planned exploration, investment and/or development projects.
Commodity risk:
• Commodities are subject to high levels of volatility in price and demand. The price of commodities depends on a wide range
of factors, most of which are outside the control of the Company. Mining, processing and transportation costs also depend
on many factors, including commodity prices, capital and operating costs in relation to any operational site.
Exploration and development risks:
• Exploration and development activity is subject to numerous risks, including failure to achieve estimated mineral resource,
recovery and production rates and capital and operating costs.
• Success in identifying economically recoverable reserves can never be guaranteed. The Company also cannot guarantee
that the companies in which it has invested will be able to obtain the necessary permits and approvals required for
development of their projects.
• Some of the countries in which the Company operates have native title laws which could affect exploration and
development activities. The companies in which the Company has an interest may be required to undertake clean-up
programmes on any contamination from their operations or to participate in site rehabilitation programmes which may
vary from country to country. The Group’s policy is to follow all applicable laws and regulations and the Company is not
currently aware of any material issues in this regard.
• Timely approval of mining permits and operating plans through the respective regulatory agencies cannot be guaranteed.
• Availability of skilled workers is an ongoing challenge.
• Geology is always a potential risk in mining activities
Market risk
• The ability of the Group (and the companies it invests in) to continue to secure sufficient and profitable sales contracts
to support its operations is a key business risk.
Internal Controls
The Board recognises the importance of both financial and non-financial controls and has reviewed the Company’s control
environment and any related shortfalls during the year. The Company has undergone, and continues to undergo, significant
expansion and development which requires commensurate and ongoing development in the Company’s financial reporting
procedures and internal controls. Whilst they are aware that no system can provide absolute assurance against material
misstatement or loss, continuing reviews of internal controls will be undertaken to ensure that adequate internal controls
are implemented and that they operate effectively.
Relations with Shareholders
The Board is committed to providing effective communication with the shareholders of the Company, with significant
developments disseminated through Stock Exchange announcements. The Board sees the annual general meeting as a forum
for communication between the Company and its shareholders and encourages their participation in its agenda.
Cambrian has a planned and structured programme to communicate with both existing shareholders and potential new investors.
Utilising this programme allows shareholders and potential investors to be both better informed and more aware of developments
at the Company. 30 Cambrian Mining Plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2008
The directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report and the financial statements in accordance with applicable law and
regulations.
Company law requires the directors to prepare financial statements for each financial year. The directors are required by the IAS
Regulation to prepare the group financial statements under IFRSs (IFRSs) as adopted by the European Union. The group financial
statements are also required by law to be properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 1985.
International Accounting Standard 1 requires that IFRS financial statements present fairly for each financial year the company's
financial position, financial performance and cash flows. This requires the faithful representation of the effects of transactions,
other events and conditions in accordance with the definitions and recognition criteria for assets, liabilities, income and expenses
set out in the International Accounting Standards Board's 'Framework for the preparation and presentation of financial
statements'. In virtually all circumstances, a fair presentation will be achieved by compliance with all applicable IFRSs. However,
directors are also required to:
• properly select and apply accounting policies;
• present information, including accounting policies, in a manner that provides relevant, reliable, comparable and
understandable information; and
• provide additional disclosures when compliance with the specific requirements in IFRSs are insufficient to enable users to
understand the impact of particular transactions, other events and conditions on the entity's financial position and financial
performance.
The directors have elected to prepare the parent company financial statements in accordance with United Kingdom Generally
Accepted Accounting Practice (United Kingdom Accounting Standards and applicable law). The parent company financial
statements are required by law to give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the company. In preparing these financial
statements, the directors are required to:
• select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently;
• make judgments and estimates that are reasonable and prudent;
• state whether applicable UK Accounting Standards have been followed, subject to any material departures disclosed and
explained in the financial statements;
• prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis unless it is inappropriate to presume that the company will
continue in business.
The directors are responsible for keeping proper accounting records that disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the
financial position of the company and enable them to ensure that the parent company financial statements comply with the
Companies Act 1985. They are also responsible for safeguarding the assets of the company and hence for taking reasonable
steps for the prevention and detection of fraud and other irregularities.
The directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity of the corporate and financial information included on the
company's website. Legislation in the United Kingdom governing the preparation and dissemination of financial statements may
differ from legislation in other jurisdictions.
Statement of Directors’ Responsibility Cambrian Mining Plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2008 31
We have audited the group and parent company financial statements (the ‘financial statements’) of Cambrian Mining Plc for
the year ended 30 June 2008 which comprise the Consolidated Income Statement, the Consolidated Statement of Recognised
Income and Expense, the Consolidated and Company Balance Sheets, the Consolidated Cash Flow Statement, and the related
notes 1 to 50. These financial statements have been prepared under the accounting policies set out therein.
This report is made solely to the Company’s members, as a body, in accordance with section 235 of the Companies Act 1985.
Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might state to the Company’s members those matters we are required to state
to them in an auditors’ report and for no other purpose. To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume
responsibility to anyone other than the Company and the Company’s members as a body, for our audit work, for this report,
or for the opinions we have formed.
Respective responsibilities of directors and auditors
The directors’ responsibilities for preparing the Annual Report and the group financial statements in accordance with applicable
law and International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the European Union, and for preparing the parent
company financial statements in accordance with applicable law and United Kingdom Accounting Standards (United Kingdom
Generally Accepted Accounting Practice) are set out in the Statement of Directors’ Responsibilities.
Our responsibility is to audit the financial statements in accordance with relevant legal and regulatory requirements and
International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland).
We report to you our opinion as to whether the financial statements give a true and fair view and are properly prepared in
accordance with the Companies Act 1985. We also report to you whether in our opinion the information given in the Directors’
Report is consistent with the financial statements.
In addition we report to you if, in our opinion, the company has not kept proper accounting records, if we have not received all the
information and explanations we require for our audit, or if information specified by law regarding directors’ remuneration and
other transactions is not disclosed.
We read the other information contained in the Annual Report, and consider whether it is consistent with the audited financial
statements. This other information comprises only the Directors’ Report, the Chairman’s Statement, the Business Review and Financial
Review. We consider the implications for our report if we become aware of any apparent misstatements or material inconsistencies
with the financial statements. Our responsibilities do not extend to any further information outside the Annual Report.
Basis of audit opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland) issued by the Auditing Practices
Board. An audit includes examination, on a test basis, of evidence relevant to the amounts and disclosures in the financial
statements. It also includes an assessment of the significant estimates and judgements made by the directors in the preparation
of the financial statements, and of whether the accounting policies are appropriate to the group’s and company’s circumstances,
consistently applied and adequately disclosed.
We planned and performed our audit so as to obtain all the information and explanations which we considered necessary in order
to provide us with sufficient evidence to give reasonable assurance that the financial statements are free from material
misstatement, whether caused by fraud or other irregularity or error. In forming our opinion we also evaluated the overall
adequacy of the presentation of information in the financial statements.
Opinion
In our opinion:
• the group financial statements give a true and fair view, in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the European Union, of the
state of the group’s affairs as at 30 June 2008 and of its loss for the year then ended;
• the parent company financial statements give a true and fair view, in accordance with United Kingdom Generally Accepted
Accounting Practice, of the state of the parent company’s affairs as at 30 June 2008;
• the group and parent company financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 1985;
and
• the information given in the Directors’ Report is consistent with the financial statements.

1 General information
Cambrian Mining Plc is a public limited company incorporated in the United Kingdom under the Companies Act 1985. The address of the
registered office is given on the inside back cover. The Company’s ordinary shares are traded on the Alternative Investment Market of the
London Stock Exchange. The nature of the Group’s operations and its principal activities are set out in the directors’ report on pages 24 to 27.
The Group has prepared its consolidated financial statements in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as adopted by
the European Union (EU).
These financial statements are presented in pounds sterling. Foreign operations are included in accordance with the policies set out in note 2.
Presentation of income statement
Exceptional derivative revaluations
The income statement has been presented in a three-column format in order to allow users to appreciate the impact on the results for the year
of certain large gains and losses including those from the revaluation of derivatives. The extent and incidence of these gains and losses reflects
the significant increases in the quoted prices of shares in Western Canadian Coal Corporation Inc (‘WCCC’), Coal International Plc and in the
Company’s own shares in the year to 30 June 2008. The Group has an associate interest in WCCC, which has US dollar convertible notes in issue
with an embedded derivative liability that has been revalued to the income statement under IFRS. The Group also has large holdings in derivatives
over WCCC and Coal International Plc shares and has US dollar convertible notes in issue that result respectively in large revaluation gains and
losses. These share price increases have mostly reversed since 30 June 2008 and the directors believe that identifying their impact separately
assists users in understanding the overall results. The exceptional profits and losses reported for the year ended June 2008 include the following:

2 Significant accounting policies
Basis of preparation
The financial statements have been prepared on the historical cost basis modified for certain items carried at fair value, as stated in the
accounting policies. The principal accounting policies adopted are set out below.
Adoption of standards and interpretations
In the current year, the Group has adopted IFRS 7 Financial Instruments: Disclosures which is effective for annual reporting periods beginning on
or after 1 January 2007, and the related amendment to IAS 1 Presentation of Financial Statements. The impact of the adoption of IFRS 7 and the
changes to IAS 1 has been to expand the disclosures provided in these financial statements regarding the Group’s financial instruments and
management of capital (see note 26). Five interpretations issued by the International Reporting Interpretations Committee are effective for the
current period. These are: IFRIC 7 Applying the Restatement Approach under IAS 29, Financial Reporting in Hyperinflationary Economies; IFRIC 8
Scope of IFRS 2; IFRIC 9 Reassessment of Embedded Derivatives; IFRIC 10 Interim Financial Reporting and Impairment; and IFRIC 11 IFRS 2
Group and Treasury Share Transactions.
The directors have assessed that the adoption of the above standards and interpretations does not have a material impact on the financial
statements of the Group.
Basis of consolidation
The consolidated financial statements incorporate the financial statements of the Company and entities controlled by the Company (its
subsidiaries) made up to 30 June each year. Control is achieved where the Company has the power to govern the financial and operating policies
of an investee entity so as to obtain benefits from its activities.
Minority interests in the net assets of consolidated subsidiaries are identified separately from the parent company’s equity therein. Minority interests
consist of the amount of those interests at the date of the original business combination and the minority’s share of changes in equity since the date
of the combination. Losses applicable to the minority in excess of the minority’s interest in the subsidiary’s equity are allocated against the interests of
the Group except to the extent that the minority has a binding obligation and is able to make an additional investment to cover the losses.
Notes to the consolidated financial statements
for the year ended 30 June 2008 The results of subsidiaries acquired or disposed of during the year are included in the consolidated income statement from the effective date of
acquisition or up to the effective date of disposal, as appropriate.
All intra-group transactions, balances, income and expenses are eliminated on consolidation.
Business combinations
The acquisition of subsidiaries in a business combination is accounted for using the purchase method. The cost of the acquisition is measured at
the aggregate of the fair values, at the date of exchange, of assets given, liabilities incurred or assumed, and equity instruments issued by the
Group in exchange for control of the acquiree, plus any costs directly attributable to the business combination. The acquiree’s identifiable assets,
liabilities and contingent liabilities that meet the conditions for recognition under IFRS 3 are recognised at their fair value at the acquisition date,
except for non-current assets (or disposal groups) that are classified as held for sale in accordance with IFRS 5 ‘Non Current Assets Held for Sale
and Discontinued Operations’, which are recognised and measured at fair value less costs to sell.
Where there is a difference between the Group’s interest in the net fair value of the acquiree’s identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent
liabilities and the cost of the business combination, any excess cost is recognised in the balance sheet as goodwill and any excess net fair value is
recognised immediately in the income statement as negative goodwill on acquisition of subsidiary. The interest of minority shareholders in the
acquiree is initially measured at the minority’s proportion of the net fair value of the assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities recognised.
Investments in associates
An associate is an entity over which the Group is in a position to exercise significant influence, but not control or joint control, through
participation in the financial and operating policy decisions of the investee. Significant influence is the power to participate in the financial and
operating policy decisions of the investee but is not control or joint control over those policies.
The results and assets and liabilities of associates are incorporated in these financial statements using the equity method of accounting except
when classified as held for sale. Investments in associates are carried in the balance sheet at cost as adjusted by post-acquisition changes in the
Group’s share of the net assets of the associates, less any impairment in the value of individual investments. Losses of the associates in excess of
the Group’s interest in those associates are not recognised unless the Group has an obligation to fund such losses.
To the extent that the cost of acquisition is less than the Group’s share of the fair values of the identifiable net assets of the associate at the date
of acquisition (i.e. a discount on acquisition), such discount is credited in the income statement in the period of acquisition.
Where a Group company transacts with an associate of the Group, profits and losses are eliminated to the extent of the Group’s interest in the
relevant associate. Losses may provide evidence of an impairment of the asset transferred in which case appropriate provision is made for
impairment.
The reporting dates of certain associates and the Group differ. Where reporting dates differ, interim results for the period to 30 June are
incorporated into the calculation of investments in associates. Associates’ accounting policies are adjusted where necessary to materially
conform to those used by the Group for like transactions and events in similar circumstances.
Revenue recognition
Revenue from sale of products and services is recognised to the extent that it is probable that the economic benefits will flow to the Group and
the revenue can be reliably measured. Revenue is measured at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable and represents amounts
receivable for goods and services provided in the normal course of business, net of discounts, VAT and other sales-related taxes.
Sales of goods are recognised when goods are delivered and title has passed.
Interest income is accrued on a time basis by reference to the principal outstanding and at the effective interest rate applicable, which is the rate
that exactly discounts estimated future cash receipts through the expected life of the financial asset to that asset’s net carrying amount.
Dividend income from investments is recognised when the shareholders’ rights to receive payment have been established.
Leasing
Leases are classified as finance leases whenever the terms of the lease transfer substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership to the lessee.
All other leases are classified as operating leases.
Assets held under finance leases are recognised as assets of the Group at their fair value or, if lower, at the present value of the minimum lease
payments, each determined at the inception of the lease. The corresponding liability to the lessor is included in the balance sheet as a finance
lease obligation. Lease payments are apportioned between finance charges and reduction of the lease obligation so as to achieve a constant rate
of interest on the remaining balance of the liability. Finance charges are charged directly against income.
Rentals payable under operating leases are charged to income on a straight-line basis over the term of the relevant lease. Benefits received and
receivable as an incentive to enter into an operating lease are also spread on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
Foreign currencies
The individual financial statements of each Group company are maintained in the currency of the primary economic environment in which it
operates (its functional currency). For the purpose of the consolidated financial statements, the results and financial position of each Group
company are expressed in pounds sterling, which is the functional currency of the Company, and the presentation currency for the consolidated
financial statements.
Cambrian Mining Plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2008 37 38 Cambrian Mining Plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2008
Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued
In preparing the financial statements of the individual companies, transactions in currencies other than the entity’s functional currency (foreign
currencies) are recorded at the rates of exchange prevailing on the dates of the transactions. At each balance sheet date, monetary assets and
liabilities that are denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at the rates prevailing on the balance sheet date. Non-monetary items
carried at fair value that are denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at the rates prevailing at the date when the fair value was
re-determined. Non-monetary items that are measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are not retranslated.
Exchange differences arising on the settlement of monetary items, and on the retranslation of monetary items, are included in the income
statement for the period. Exchange differences arising on the retranslation of non-monetary items carried at fair value are included in the income
statement for the period except for differences arising on the retranslation of non-monetary items in respect of which gains and losses are
recognised directly in equity.
For the purpose of presenting consolidated financial statements, the assets and liabilities of the Group’s foreign operations are translated at
exchange rates prevailing on the balance sheet date. Income and expense items are translated at the average exchange rates for the period,
unless exchange rates fluctuate significantly during that period, in which case the exchange rates at the date of transactions are used. Exchange
differences arising, if any, are classified as equity and transferred to the Group’s translation reserve. Such translation differences are recognised
as income or as expense in the period in which the operation is disposed of.
Fair value adjustments arising on the acquisition of a foreign entity are treated as assets and liabilities of the foreign entity and translated at the
closing rate.
When a monetary item forms part of a net investment in a foreign operation, exchange differences are recognised in equity.
Rates of exchange to £1 were as follows:
Average for Average for
the year to the year to
30 June 2008 30 June 2008 30 June 2007 30 June 2007
US dollar 0.501 0.499 0.499 0.518
Canadian dollar 0.496 0.495 0.471 0.457
Australian dollar 0.482 0.448 0.423 0.406
Purchase of a minority interest in a controlled entity
The cost of the purchase of shares is measured at the aggregate of the fair value of assets given at the date of exchange, liabilities incurred or
assumed and the fair value of equity instruments issued by the Group in exchange for shares purchased in a controlled entity, plus any costs
directly attributable to the transaction. The identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities of a controlled entity are re-valued to fair value
at the date of the acquisition, but only to the extent of the incremental proportion of equity acquired.
Where there is a difference between the increase in the Group’s interest in the net fair value of the acquiree’s identifiable assets, liabilities and
contingent liabilities and the cost of the shares purchased, any excess cost is recognised immediately in the balance sheet and any excess net fair
value is recognised immediately in the income statement as negative goodwill.
Borrowing costs
All borrowing costs are recognised in the income statement in the period in which they are incurred.
Operating loss
Operating loss is stated after the share of results of associates but before investment revenue, finance costs and other gains and losses.
Taxation
The tax expense represents the sum of the tax currently payable and deferred tax.
Current tax is based on taxable profit for the year. T axable profit differs from net profit as reported in the income statement because it excludes
items of income or expense that are taxable or deductible in other years and it further excludes items that are never taxable or deductible. The
Group’s liability for current tax is calculated using tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is the tax expected to be payable or recoverable on differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in the
financial statements and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable profit, and is accounted for using the balance sheet
liability method. Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised for all taxable temporary differences and deferred tax assets are recognised for
all deductible temporary differences, carry forward of unused tax assets and unused tax losses to the extent that it is probable that taxable
profits will be available against which deductible temporary differences and the carry forward of unused tax credits and unused tax losses can be
utilised. Such assets and liabilities are not recognised if the temporary difference arises from the initial recognition of goodwill or from the initial
recognition (other than in a business combination) of other assets and liabilities in a transaction that affects neither the tax profit nor the
accounting profit.
Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for taxable temporary differences arising on investments in subsidiaries and associates, except where the
Group is able to control the reversal of the temporary difference and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the
foreseeable future.
Deferred tax assets are recognised for deductible temporary differences arising on investments in subsidiaries and associates, only to the extent
that it is probable that the temporary difference will reverse in the foreseeable future and taxable profit will be available against which the
temporary difference can be utilised. The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each balance sheet date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that
sufficient taxable profits will be available to allow all or part of the asset to be recovered.
Unrecognised deferred tax assets are reassessed at each balance sheet date and are recognised to the extent that it has become probable that
future taxable profits will allow the deferred tax asset to be recovered.
Deferred tax is calculated at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period when the liability is settled or the asset is realised, based on tax
rates (and tax laws) that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date. Deferred tax is charged or credited in the income
statement, except when it relates to items charged or credited directly to equity, in which case the deferred tax is also dealt with in equity.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to set off current tax assets against current tax liabilities and
when they relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority and the Group intends to settle its current tax assets and liabilities on a
net basis.
Intangible assets
Exploration and evaluation assets and mineral assets
Exploration and evaluation assets arising from a business combination are recognised as an intangible asset and initially measured at estimated
fair value, generally based on the excess of the cost of the business combination over the Group’s interest in the net fair value of the other
identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities recognised, unless a more reliable indicator of fair value is available. The costs of exploration
properties and leases, which include the cost of acquiring prospective properties and exploration rights and costs incurred in exploration and
evaluation activities, are capitalised as intangible assets as part of exploration and evaluation assets.
Mineral properties relate to those properties where commercial extraction is demonstrable. Mineral properties acquired in a business
combination are recognised as an intangible asset, being the excess of the present value of the economic reserves over the allocated amount of
related property, plant and equipment and exploration and evaluation costs.
Exploration and evaluation assets are carried forward during the exploration and evaluation stage and are assessed for impairment in accordance
with the indicators of impairment as set out in IFRS 6 ‘Exploration for and Evaluation of Mineral Resources’. In circumstances where a property is
abandoned, the cumulative capitalised costs relating to the property are written off in the period. No amortisation is charged prior to the
commencement of production.
When commercial production commences exploration, evaluation and development costs previously capitalised are amortised over the
commercial reserves of the mining property on a unit of production basis.
Property, plant and equipment
Land is stated at cost less any recognised impairment loss. Buildings and plant and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation
and any recognised impairment loss.
The provision for the future cost of rehabilitation and restoration activities in respect of mining properties is recognised as part of the cost of the
related property, plant and equipment at the time of the commencement of commercial production and establishment of plant sites, based on
management’s assessment of the expected future cash flows associated with rehabilitation and restoration activities.
Depreciation is provided on all depreciable property, plant and equipment at rates calculated to write off the cost of each asset on a straight-line
basis over its expected useful life as follows:
Buildings 2% to 5%
Plant and equipment
Plant and machinery 10% to 40%
Furniture and equipment 10% to 40%
Vehicles 20% to 30%
The cost of maintenance, repairs and replacement of minor items of property, plant and equipment are charged to the income statement as
incurred. Renewals and asset improvements are capitalised.
An item of property, plant and equipment is derecognised upon disposal or when no further economic benefits are expected from its use or
disposal. Upon sale or retirement of property, plant and equipment, the cost and related accumulated depreciation are eliminated from the
financial statements. Any resulting gains or losses are included in the income statement.
Impairment of tangible and intangible assets
At each balance sheet date, the Group reviews the carrying amounts of its tangible and intangible assets to determine whether there is any
indication that those assets have suffered an impairment loss. If any such indication exists, the recoverable amount of the asset is estimated in
order to determine the extent of the impairment loss (if any). Where the asset does not generate cash flows that are independent from other
assets, the Group estimates the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit to which the asset belongs.
Recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs to sell and value in use. In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are
discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks
specific to the asset for which the estimates of future cash flows have not been adjusted.
Cambrian Mining Plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2008 39 40 Cambrian Mining Plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2008
Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued
If the recoverable amount of an asset (or cash-generating unit) is estimated to be less than its carrying amount, the carrying amount of the asset
(cash-generating unit) is reduced to its recoverable amount. An impairment loss is recognised as an expense immediately.
Where an impairment loss subsequently reverses, the carrying amount of the asset (cash-generating unit) is increased to the revised estimate of
its recoverable amount, but so that the increased carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined had
no impairment loss been recognised for the asset (cash-generating unit) in prior years. A reversal of an impairment loss is recognised as income
immediately.
Inventories
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Cost comprises direct materials and, where applicable, direct labour costs and
those overheads that have been incurred in bringing the inventories to their present location and condition. Net realisable value represents the
estimated selling price less all estimated costs of completion and costs to be incurred in marketing, selling and distribution.
Financial instruments
Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognised in the Group’s balance sheet when the Group becomes a party to the contractual provisions
of the instrument.
Trade and other receivables
Trade and other receivables are measured at initial recognition at fair value, and are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective
interest rate method. Appropriate allowances for estimated irrecoverable amounts are recognised in the income statement when there is
objective evidence that the asset is impaired. The allowance recognised is measured as the difference between the asset’s carrying amount and
the present value of estimated future cash flows discounted at the effective interest rate computed at initial recognition.
Investments
Investments are recognised and derecognised on a trade date where a purchase or sale of an investment is under a contract whose terms
require delivery of the investment within the timeframe established by the market concerned, and are initially measured at cost, including
transaction costs.
Investments are classified as either held for trading or available for sale, and are measured at subsequent reporting dates at fair value. Where
securities are held for trading, gains and losses arising from changes in fair value are included in the income statement for the period. For available
for sale investments, gains and losses arising from changes in fair value are recognised directly in equity, until the security is disposed of or is
determined to be impaired, at which time the cumulative gain or loss previously recognised in equity is included in the income statement for the
period. Impairment losses recognised in the income statement for equity investments classified as available for sale are not subsequently
reversed through the income statement.
Impairment losses recognised in the income statement for debt instruments classified as available for sale are subsequently reversed if an
increase in the fair value of the instrument can be objectively related to an event occurring after the recognition of the impairment loss.
The fair value of investments that are actively traded in organised financial markets is determined by reference to quoted market bid prices at the
close of business on the balance sheet date. For investments with no active market, fair value is determined using valuation techniques. Such
techniques include using recent arm’s length market transactions; reference to the current market value of another instrument that is
substantially the same; discounted cash flow analysis and option pricing models.
Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash on hand and demand deposits, and other short-term highly liquid investments that are readily
convertible to a known amount of cash and are subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value.
Financial liabilities and equity
Financial liabilities and equity instruments are classified according to the substance of the contractual arrangements entered into. An equity
instrument is any contract that evidences a residual interest in the assets of the Group after deducting all of its liabilities.
Convertible loan notes
The convertible loan facility issued by Cambrian is a compound financial instrument. Compound financial instruments are required to be analysed
in order to identify and measure the different components, usually liability and equity. As the loan has been issued in US$, which is not the
functional currency of Cambrian Mining plc, the conversion element of the facility does not meet the criteria of equity. Accordingly, the
conversion element of the facility has been identified as an embedded derivative that is not closely related to the facility, which must be
separately measured and recorded from the liability component of the instrument.
On initial recognition, the fair value of the embedded derivative is measured using an option pricing methodology. The liability is then recognised
as the residual between the fair value of the compound financial instrument, and the embedded derivative.
Subsequent to initial recognition, changes in the fair value of the embedded derivative are recognised in the Income Statement, in accordance
with the policy set out below, and the liability is measured at amortised cost, using the effective interest rate method. The effective interest rate
is determined as the interest rate that discounts the total cash flows over the life of the instrument to the value of the liability recognised on
initial recognition. Trade payables
Trade payables are initially measured at fair value, and are subsequently measured at amortised cost, using the effective interest rate method.
Equity instruments
Equity instruments issued by the Company are recorded at the proceeds received, net of direct issue costs.
Derivative financial instruments
The use of financial derivatives is governed by the Group’s policies which provide written principles on the use of financial derivatives. Changes in
the fair value of derivative financial instruments that do not qualify for hedge accounting are recognised in the income statement as they arise.
Derivatives embedded in convertible debt securities issued by the Group are treated as separate derivatives and are carried at fair value, with
gains or losses reported in the income statement.
The Group also takes positions in equity options relating to listed securities of other entities. Such options are carried at fair value, with gains or
losses reported in the income statement.
Provisions
Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present obligation as a result of a past event, and it is probable that the Group will be required to
settle that obligation. Provisions are measured at the directors’ best estimate of the expenditure required to settle the obligation at the balance
sheet date, and are discounted to present value where the effect is material.
Upon initial recognition of provision for restoration and rehabilitation, a corresponding amount is capitalised as part of the carrying amount of
related property, plant and equipment. The provision is measured at the present value of the estimated future expenditure with the
corresponding adjustment going to the cost of the asset. The provision is increased as further disturbance occurs, creating a further obligation
to rehabilitate. The unwinding of discount of the provision is included within finance costs.
Employee leave benefits
Liabilities for wages and salaries, including non-monetary benefits and accrued but unused annual leave are recognised in respect of employees’
services up to the reporting date. They are measured at the amounts expected to be paid when the liabilities are settled.
Retirement benefit costs
Payments to defined contribution retirement benefit schemes are charged as an expense as they fall due.
Share-based payments
The Group has applied the requirements of IFRS 2 ‘Share-based Payment’. In accordance with the transitional provisions, IFRS 2 has been applied
to all grants of equity instruments after 7 November 2002 that were unvested at 1 January 2005.
The Group issues equity-settled share-based payments to certain employees. Equity-settled share-based payments are measured at fair value
(excluding the effect of non market-based vesting conditions) at the date of grant. The fair value determined at the grant date of the equity-
settled share-based payments is expensed on a straight-line basis over the vesting period, based on the Group’s estimate of shares that will
eventually vest and adjusted for the effect of non market-based vesting conditions.
Where the value of the goods or services received in exchange for the share-based payment cannot be reliably estimated the fair value is
measured by use of the binomial valuation model. The expected life used in the model has been adjusted, based on management’s best estimate,
for the effects of non-transferability, exercise restrictions, and behavioural considerations.
3 Critical accounting judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty
Critical judgements in applying the Group’s accounting policies
In the process of applying the Group’s accounting policies, which are described in note 2, management has made the following judgements that
have the most significant effect on the amounts recognised in the financial statements (apart from those involving estimations, which are dealt
with below).
Impairment of intangible assets and investments
The assessment of intangible assets and investments for any indications of impairment involves judgement. If an indication of impairment exists,
a formal estimate of recoverable amount is performed and an impairment loss recognised to the extent that carrying amount exceeds
recoverable amount. Recoverable amount is determined as the higher of fair value less costs to sell and value in use.
Deferred tax assets
The assessment of availability of future taxable profits involves judgement. A deferred tax asset is recognised to the extent that it is probable
that taxable profits will be available against which deductible temporary differences and the carry forward of unused tax credits and unused tax
losses can be utilised.
Key sources of estimation uncertainty
The preparation of financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported for assets
and liabilities as at the balance sheet date and the amounts reported for revenues and expenses during the year. The nature of estimation means
that actual outcomes could differ from those estimates. The key sources of estimation uncertainty that have a significant risk of causing material
adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial year are discussed below.
Cambrian Mining Plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2008 41 42 Cambrian Mining Plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2008
Share-based payments
The estimation of share-based payment costs requires the selection of an appropriate valuation model and consideration as to the inputs
necessary for the valuation model chosen. The Group has made estimates as to the volatility of its own shares, the probable life of options
granted and the time of exercise of those options. The models used by the Group are the binomial valuation model and the Black-Scholes model.
Measurement of fair value for held for trading and available for sale financial investments
The estimation of fair value for held for trading and available for sale investments is determined based on quoted market prices for assets where
quoted market prices exist. The fair values of unlisted available for sale investments are estimated using valuation techniques based on
assumptions that are not supported by observable market prices. For derivatives held that are not traded on an open market and therefore have
no quoted market price, an appropriate valuation model is required to be selected and consideration given to the inputs required for that model.
In calculating the fair value of derivatives held by the Group, the binomial valuation model has been adopted.
Fair values recognised in business combinations
The estimation of fair values of intangible mineral rights and mineral assets and any associated property, plant and equipment acquired in
business combinations involves estimates over the quantities of minerals that may be recovered and the technical and commercial feasibility of
extraction, which may be highly uncertain. Generally, fair values assigned to exploration and evaluation assets are limited so as not to generate
negative goodwill where there is significant uncertainty over the estimates of fair value.
Restoration provision
The estimation of the amount of restoration provision involves estimates over the expected future cash flows associated with rehabilitation and
restoration activities, which may be highly uncertain. Management has estimated the provision based on an assessment in June 2007 of the
expected future cash flows relating to certain ‘clean-up’ activities and the treatment of tailings dams.
Impairment of intangible assets
The assessment of intangible assets for any indications of impairment involves judgement. If an indication of impairment, as defined in IFRS 6,
exists, a formal estimate of recoverable amount is performed and an impairment loss recognised to the extent that carrying amount exceeds
recoverable amount. Recoverable amount is determined as the higher of fair value less costs to sell and value in use. The calculation of
recoverable amount requires an estimation of the value in use of the cash-generating units to which the intangible assets are allocated. In
assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current
market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset for which the estimates of future cash flows have not been
adjusted.
Measurement of fair value of disposal groups
Disposal groups recognised in accordance with IFRS 5 ‘Non Current Assets Held for Sale and Discontinued Operations’ are required to be
measured at the lower of cost and fair value less costs to sell. Management have assessed the carrying value of the disposal group at 30 June
2008 taking into account its quoted market price and the underlying assets and liabilities of the disposal group. In assessing fair value,
management have concluded that the underlying value of the assets and liabilities are more indicative of fair value than the quoted market price,
with the exception of the 5% of the group that was disposed on the 1 July 2008. Refer to note 13 for further information.
Tax Provisions
Assessing the outcome of uncertain tax provisions requires judgements to be made regarding the result of negotiations with and enquiries from
tax authorities in a number of jurisdictions. The assessments made are based on the advice from independent tax advisers and the status of
ongoing discussions with the relevant tax authorities.

6 Business and geographical segments
Business segments
For management purposes, the Group is currently organised into four operating divisions – (i) Coal, (ii) Base and Precious Metals (iii) Energy &
Resources Technology and (iv) Investment and Other. These divisions are the basis on which the Group reports its primary segment information.
Principal activities are as follows:
• The Coal segment relates to the mining and exploration of coal deposits.
• The Base and Precious Metal segment includes mining and exploration activities for precious metals including gold and antimony.
• The Investment and Other segment carries out investments in various projects and other listed and unlisted resource companies and includes
a number of holding companies.
• The Energy & Resources Technology segment focuses on oil and gas exploration, evaluation and development. It also invests in the
development of technology related to the exploitation of oil shale. This segment forms the discontinued operations in 2008. (see note 13).
Transfer prices between business segments are on an arm’s length basis in a manner similar to transactions with third parties. Segment revenues,
segment expenses and segment results include transfers between business segments. These transfers are eliminated on consolidation. Segment
information about these businesses is presented below.

The derivatives that gave rise to gains and losses upon revaluation to fair value comprise options over associate company shares, held for the
purpose of their exercise and hence to increase holdings in those strategic operating interests, and options over the Company’s own shares
embedded in convertible loan notes issued.
The gain/(loss) on dilution of interests in associate arise from the difference between the interest gained by the Group in the issue proceeds from
the dilutive share issues and the dilution of the Group’s interest in the other net assets of the associate.
The gain/(loss) on dilution of investment in subsidiary (deemed disposals) result from the dilutive effect of issues to minority interests and the
Group interest gained in the issue proceeds.

Disposal of subsidiary undertaking – Falls Mountain Coal Inc
The asset and liabilities held for sale at 30 June 2007 comprised those relating to the Group’s subsidiary Falls Mountain Coal Inc. A conditional
agreement to transfer Falls Mountain to Western Canadian Coal Corp (‘WCCC’) was reached on 30 November 2007 for consideration
comprising a first payment of 18,740,898 new shares in WCCC and a deferred payment of C$14,055,673 cash to be received on
30 September 2008 for which the Group had the option to receive 4,534,088 additional WCCC shares expiring 1 July 2008. On 25 February
2008 Western Canadian Coal Corporation entered into a definitive deal to buy Falls Mountain Coal Inc subject to shareholder approval which was
obtained on 1 April 2008.
The deal completed with all conditions met on 6 May 2008 resulting in the following gain:

(i) On 27 June 2008, the Group opted to receive the deferred consideration in shares and 4,534,088 shares were issued to the Group by WCCC in final settlement. The fair value of these shares received
was £19,685,000 of which £13,573,000 is reflected in the above valuation, a subsequent increase in value of the related conversion rights derivative of £6,090,000 is reflected in other gains and
losses and a further £22,000 exchange gain is reflected in other operating income.
Partial disposal of subsidiary undertaking – Xtract Energy plc (‘Xtract’)
During the year and following a strategic review, the Board expressed the intention to sell and/or distribute in specie the shares in Xtract to the
Company’s shareholders. Xtract is a listed subsidiary of the Group and represents its Energy and Resources Technology segment. On 20 June
2008 the Board approved the disposal of 36.5 million shares and 36.5 million warrants to Wasabi Energy, reducing the Group’s shareholding in
Xtract by 4.9% from 50.1% to 45.2%. The effective date of the sale was 1 July 2008.
In line with the requirements of IFRS 5 in respect of the sale of a disposal group, all the assets and liabilities of Xtract group consolidated by the
Group at 30 June 2008 have been presented as assets and liabilities held for sale and the impact of Xtract has been disclosed as discontinued
operations in the group income statement. The loss on measurement to fair value of assets held for sale of £552,000 is attributed to intangible
assets and reflects a write down to a net realisable value in line with the 4.9% portion sold. 50 Cambrian Mining Plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2008

15 Loss per share
The share options and warrants in issue at 30 June 2008 are not considered dilutive as the Group made a loss in 2008. Therefore the Group has
not presented a diluted loss per share.

The share options and warrants in issue at 30 June 2007 and 30 June 2008 are not considered dilutive as the Group has made losses in both
years. Certain options and warrants and convertible loan notes of the Group are not dilutive and are therefore excluded from the weighted
average number of ordinary shares for the purposes of diluted loss per share.
In 2008 there were no potential ordinary shares that were anti dilutive (2007: nil).
On the 1 August 2008 the Group acquired the remaining interest in Coal International Plc (since re-registered as Coal International) by the issue
of 19,704,194 shares. Refer to note 36 for additional information.

(i) The revaluation on purchase of minority interests in the year ended June 2007 pertains to changes in the fair value of net assets of AGD Mining Limited to the extent of further ownership interests
acquired by the Group.
(ii) Subsequent to year end, Zhibek Resources Limited (‘Zhibek’), a subsidiary company of Xtract served notice of their desire to terminate the service agreement in regard to the Beshkent-Togap water
injection project. The result of this action is to cease operations in regard to the project and therefore all assets held in relation to this project have been written off, including previously capitalised
exploration and development costs of £431,000 and exploration and evaluation assets recognised on acquisition of £99,000.The remaining £49,000 of the impairment loss relates to costs associated
with exploration tenements which will be abandoned.
(iii)Intangible assets at 30 June 2008 relate to AGD Mining Limited. Based on current information and budgets available, management believes that the asset is not subject to impairment. However, recent
and ongoing changes in the mining industry could impact the assumptions that support the carrying value, which may lead to future impairments. 52 Cambrian Mining Plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2008

The cost of a 27.5% interest in Energybuild Group Plc acquired on 3 August 2007 comprised £3,501,000 in Company shares, £3,652,000 in
loans settled and £15,000 in cash expenses, totalling £7,168,000. The remaining cash purchase was £4,091,000 in respect of further
investment in Elko Energy and £388,000 in respect of further investment in Wasabi.
During the period a share for share exchange occurred when Xtract agreed to sell its holding of 61.5 million ordinary shares in Aviva, together
with an interest in a steel-making technology, to Wasabi in exchange for the issue of 175 million new Wasabi ordinary shares together with
25 million warrants exercisable at a price of A$0.03 per Wasabi share.
Elimination of gains on disposals to associates includes the unrecognised proportion of a gain on disposal of Falls Mountain assets and liabilities
held for sale to the Group’s associate Western Canadian Coal Corporation of £23,797,000 (see note 13), equating to the Group’s percentage
interest in the associate. A further £528,000 relates to the unrealised proportion of a gain on the exchange of shares held by Xtract in Aviva
Corporation for shares in Wasabi Energy. This is reflected in a transfer from the Available for sale investments reserve (see note 32).
During the year ended 30 June 2006, an impairment loss amounting to £4,662,000 was recognised in the income statement relating to the
Group’s associate interest in Coal International Plc. As at 30 June 2007, the directors assessed the future long term value of the investment and
determined that the previous impairment charge should be maintained but not increased. The directors have now assessed the future long term
value as at 30 June 2008 to be greater than the carrying value before the previous impairment charge, so this has been reversed resulting in a
credit to the income statement of £4,662,000.
The disposals during the year comprised partial disposals of MEO Australia Limited (‘MEO’) and Wasabi Energy Limited (‘Wasabi’) following which
both investments were transferred to available for sale investments. The sale of MEO shares generated cash proceeds of £8,515,000 resulting
in a gain on disposal of £3,335,000. The sale of Wasabi shares generated cash proceeds of £1,243,000 resulting in a loss on disposal of
£415,000. 54 Cambrian Mining Plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2008

Available for sale investments
Available for sale investments comprise investments in listed securities and debt instruments, which are held by the Group as strategic
investments. No unlisted available for sale investments are held.
Included in available for sale investments is the debt portion of listed 7.5% convertible debentures, denominated in Canadian dollars, issued by
the Group’s associate Western Canadian Coal Corporation on 24 March 2006 with a maturity date of 24 March 2011. The option to convert the
debentures into common shares have been separately identified and classified as a derivative financial instrument, the valuation of which has
been determined using the binomial valuation model. The carrying value of the debt portion of £9,730,000 (2007: £11,012,000) is calculated
after deducting the options valuation from the quoted value of the debentures on the Toronto Stock Exchange.
In the prior year financial statements, the debt portion of the unlisted convertible notes in Coal International plc, an associate of the Group, was
included in Available for sale investments at a carrying value of £12,960,000. As the notes are unlisted and the debt portion has the
characteristics of a loan instrument, it is considered most appropriate to include this in other receivables, so has accordingly been reclassified.
The major disposals for the period included the sale of the Group’s entire holding in Asian Mineral Resources shares generating cash proceeds of
£10,689,000 and a profit of £7,161,000 and its entire holding in Vulcan Resources shares generating cash proceeds of £2,035,000 and a
profit of £535,000. In addition, the Group’s results include a profit of £1,246,000 resulting from the disposal of Aviva Corporation shares in
exchange for shares in Wasabi Energy shares, by group subsidiary Xtract Energy. 56 Cambrian Mining Plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2008
Held for trading investments
Held for trading investments comprise the Group’s former strategic investments in listed securities that were since identified for disposal and

At 30 June 2008, the Group has a $40 million floating rate revolving loan facility arrangement at floating interest rates exposing the Group to
interest rate risk. The facility commenced on 21 July 2006 and is split into two tranches, ‘A’ and ‘B’. The tranches were originally established at
$25 million each but on 18 June 2008, the loan agreement was amended increasing the tranche ‘A’ facility to $40 million and reducing the
tranche ‘B’ facility to $nil.
In accordance with the amended agreement above, effective 21 October 2008 the interest rate payable on the pre-existing tranche ‘A’ facility
has increased to between LIBOR plus 3.5% and 5.5%, depending on the borrowing base ratio calculation, whilst any amounts drawn on tranche
‘A’ in excess of the preceding $25 million facility attract interest at LIBOR plus 4.5% at all times. The facility matures on 21 January 2009.
The directors estimate that the carrying value of the Group’s borrowings is not materially different from the fair value.
At 30 June 2008, the Group had available £7.5 million (2007: £12.6 million) of un-drawn committed borrowing facilities in respect of which all
conditions precedent had been met. A commitment fee is payable based on the undrawn balance at an annual rate of 1%.
The facility is secured via a fixed and floating charge over the shares of Cambrian Investment Holdings Limited, AGD Mining Limited, Deepgreen
Minerals Corporation Pty Limited and various assets of these companies.
24 Convertible loan notes
The US$27 million convertible loan notes were issued on 23 May 2006. The notes are convertible into fully paid ordinary shares of the Company
at any time during the period from 7 July 2006 to 7 May 2009. The number of shares to be issued upon exercise of the conversion right shall be
determined by dividing the principal amount of the note (translated into pounds sterling at the fixed rate of US$1.8761/£1.00) by the
conversion price. The conversion price on the date of issue was 183.25 pence per share.
If the notes have not been converted, they will be redeemed on 23 May 2009 at par. Interest of 6.75 % will be paid annually up until that
settlement date. Payments of principal and interest are required in US Dollars. The net proceeds received from the issue of the convertible loan
notes have been split between the liability element and a derivative component, representing the fair value of the embedded option to convert
the liability into equity of the Group. Refer to note 25 for information on the derivative component. The liability component is as follows:
Total
£’000
Liability component at 30 June 2006 13,090
Interest charged 1,490
Interest paid (924)
Exchange translation (on liability component) (1,267)
Liability component at 30 June 2007 12,389
Interest charged 1,500
Interest paid (931)
Exchange translation (on liability component) 82
Liability component at 30 June 2008 13,040
The interest charged for the year is calculated by applying an effective interest rate of 12.2% to the liability component for the period from the
date of issuance of the loan notes to the balance sheet date.
The directors estimate that the carrying value of the liability component of the convertible loan notes at 30 June 2008 approximates the fair
value. The carrying value has been calculated by discounting the future cash flows at the market interest rate. 58 Cambrian Mining Plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2008

Coal International Plc convertible loan 23,701,848 30/11/2008 £0.60 7,140
58,743
The WCCC listed debentures are convertible into common shares at any time prior to their maturity at a conversion price of C$4.00 per common
share, being a conversion rate of 250 common shares per C$1,000 principal amount of convertible debentures. The convertible debentures held
by the Group have a face value of C$29,000,000 (2007: C$29,000,000) and convert into 7,250,000 (2007: 7,250,000) common shares.
Western Canadian Coal Corporation can redeem the convertible debentures any time after 24 March 2009 if the share price exceeds 125% of
the conversion price. The fair value of the conversion option has been determined using the binomial valuation model.
On 13 September 2007 Cambrian Mining Plc provided a C$5,000,000 convertible loan facility to Western Canadian Coal Corporation bearing
interest at 8% and at 12% from 1 August 2008. The loan was convertible into the ordinary shares of Western Canadian Coal Corporation at
C$3.25 per share at the discretion of Cambrian Mining Plc. On 22 January 2008 Cambrian Mining Plc and Western Canadian Coal Corporation
agreed to a variation of terms amounting to a revised interest rate of 8.5% effective from the issue date and a revised conversion price of
C$0.75. The loan and accrued interest which at 30 June 2008 amounted to C$5,349,334 is convertible into common shares at any time prior
to maturity on 15 July 2011, at C$0.75 per common share equivalent to 7,132,445 WCCC common shares. The fair value of the conversion
option has been determined using the binomial valuation model.
During the year ended 30 June 2007 Cambrian Mining Plc provided a £13,500,000 convertible loan facility to Coal International Plc. The loan
and accrued interest was convertible at the discretion of Cambrian Mining Plc, subject to shareholder approval, into the ordinary shares of Coal
International Plc at 60p per share. The loan was originally due for repayment on 13 November 2008, with an option for Coal International Plc to
extend until 7 January 2009. The loan bears interest at LIBOR plus 2.5%, and the cumulative accrued interest at 30 June 2008 was £1,627,000
(2007: £366,000). The fair value of the conversion option has been determined using the binomial valuation model. The conversion option has
since been cancelled as a result of the acquisition of Coal International Plc by the Group on 1 August 2008. The existing convertible loan and
working capital facilities described above were repaid and redrawn under a new working capital facility. The new facility has a five year term and
bears interest at LIBOR plus 4%. There is no convertible feature under the new facility. Refer to note 36 for additional information.

The key inputs used in the valuation of unquoted warrants and the embedded derivatives in convertible debt instruments both for 2008 and
2007 were determined in the following manner:
• The underlying share price was calculated by reference to the weighted average share price of the entity in the 30 day period prior to
valuation.
• The volatility of the share price measures the uncertainty about the returns provided by the shares and has been determined with reference to
the annualised standard deviation of monthly share prices for periods between one and five years, depending on the availability of traded
share price information.
• Risk free rates have been estimated based on the government bond rates in the country where the shares are traded, which have expiry
periods similar to those of the options.
• No dividends are expected over the life of the options, given the current stage and nature of the businesses to which the options relate.
• In addition to the assumptions above, when determining the fair value of the embedded derivatives, time to maturity was calculated as the
period until the option can be redeemed and not the expiry of the right to convert.

The embedded derivatives in convertible debt instruments issued by the Group comprise the US$27 million convertible loan notes the Group has
in issue. The date of maturity and expiry of the conversion options is 23 May 2009. The terms of these notes are detailed in note 24.
The fair values of the unquoted options have been determined using a modified Black-Scholes valuation model. The key inputs used in the
valuation of the derivative in the convertible debt instrument were determined in the following manner:
• The underlying share price was calculated by reference to the market share price of the Company on the date of the valuation.
• Foreign exchange rates are calculated by reference to the spot rates on the dates at which the derivative has been valued.
• The volatility of the share price measures the uncertainty about the returns provided by the shares and has been determined with reference to
the annualised standard deviation of daily share prices for periods matched to the time to maturity of the derivatives.
• Risk-free rates have been estimated based on UK and US government bond rates, which have expiry periods similar to those of the options.
• The dividend yield has been assumed to be £nil (2007:1.5p) per share.
26 Financial risk management objectives and policies
The Group’s finance function provides a centralised service for the provision of finance and the management and control of liquidity, foreign
exchange and interest rates exposures. The function manages the Group’s exposure to reduce risk in accordance with policies approved by
the Board.
The Group’s principal financial instruments, other than derivatives, comprise convertible debentures and notes held, bank loans, convertible loan
notes issued and cash and short-term deposits. The main purpose of these financial instruments is to finance the Group’s operations. The Group
has various other financial instruments such as trade and other receivables, security deposits and trade and other payables, which arise directly
from its operations.
Cash flow interest rate risk
The Group’s exposure to the risk of changes in market interest rates relates primarily to the Group’s cash assets and the external loan facility.
The following tables detail the Group’s remaining contractual maturity for its financial assets and liabilities that are exposed to interest rate risk.
The tables have been drawn up based on the undiscounted cash flows of financial assets and liabilities based on the earliest date on which the
Group can be required to pay or have a right to receive. The table includes both interest and principal cash flows. 60 Cambrian Mining Plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2008

Interest on financial instruments classified as fixed rate is fixed until the maturity of the instrument. The other financial instruments of the Group
that are not included in the above tables are non-interest bearing and are therefore not subject to interest rate risk.
Foreign currency risk
The presentational currency of the Group is pound sterling. The functional currency of the parent company is pound sterling although certain of
the Group’s subsidiaries use functional currencies other than that of the parent company functional currency. The Group is exposed to currency
risk due to movements in foreign currencies to functional currency exchange rates relating to foreign currency transactions and balances of each
subsidiary. It is the policy of the Group not to enter into currency hedging transactions.
The following table sets out the carrying amount, by currency denomination, of the Group’s financial instruments that are exposed to foreign
currency risk:

Market risk
The Group holds listed and unlisted equity investments, listed and unlisted debt securities and derivative financial instruments. Therefore, the
Group is exposed to market risk due to movements in related market prices and other market variables, including commodity prices.
Liquidity risk and Capital Management
The Group’s objective is to maintain a balance between continuity of funding and flexibility through the use of bank loans, convertible loan notes
and finance lease arrangements. Certain of the Group’s bank loans and convertible loans fall due for repayment in 2009. The Group is engaged in
discussions regarding a revised or new facility but has also forecast that it will be able to meet the repayments when due if necessary from
operational and investment activities (a significant proportion of the Group’s net assets are invested in readily disposable securities providing
additional financial flexibility, if required).
Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued Cambrian Mining Plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2008 61
Credit risk
The Group’s principal financial assets are bank balances and cash, trade and other receivables, derivative financial instruments and investments.
The Group’s credit risk is primarily attributable to its trade receivables and investment in debt securities.
The credit risk on liquid funds is limited because the counterparties are banks with high credit-ratings assigned by international credit-rating
agencies. The Group’s principal concentration of credit risk relates to its investment in the listed convertible debentures and unlisted convertible
loan notes of Western Canadian Coal Corporation and the convertible loan to Coal International Plc (see notes 20 and 22).
Sensitivity Analysis
For financial instruments held, the Company has used a sensitivity analysis technique that measures the change in the fair value and cash flows of
the Company’s financial instruments for hypothetical changes in all relevant market risk variables.
The amounts generated from the sensitivity analysis are forward-looking estimates of market risk assuming certain market conditions. Actual
results in the future may differ materially from those projected results due to the inherent uncertainty of global financial markets. Unless stated
otherwise, the methods and assumptions used are the same as those applied in the previous reporting period.
The sensitivity of profit or loss and of equity on an after-tax basis due to changes in the relevant risk variables as at 30 June 2008 and 30 June
2007 are set out in the tables below. The methods and assumptions used in calculating are set out in note 25 to the financial statements.
The sensitivity analyses are for illustrative purposes only – in practice market rates rarely change in isolation and are likely to be interdependent.
Interest rate sensitivity analysis
The sensitivity analyses below have been determined based on the exposure to interest rates for floating rate instruments, being bank loans and
the LIBOR + 2.5% convertible loan. The analysis is prepared assuming the amount of liability outstanding at balance sheet date was outstanding
for the whole year.
At 30 June 2008 an increase of up to 4.6% and a decrease of up to 0.37% depending on the underlying instrument was used as this represents
the maximum and minimum exposure under the terms of the loan agreement. If interest rates are calculated using these percentages and all
other variables were held constant, the Group’s result would decrease by £417,000 or increase by £7,000.
At 30 June 2007 an increase of up to 2.14% and a decrease of up to 0.77% depending on the underlying instrument was used as this
represented the maximum and minimum exposure under the terms of the loan agreement. If interest rates were calculated using these
percentages and all other variables were held constant, the Group’s result would decrease by £194,000 or increase by £5,000.
Market risk sensitivity analysis
The estimated change in fair values for changes in market prices are based on an instantaneous increase or decrease of 50 per cent for relevant
market prices at the reporting date, with all other variables remaining constant. The following tables set out the potential exposure:

The estimated change in cash flows for changes in base and precious metal prices are based on an instantaneous increase or decrease of 10% at
the reporting date.
At 30 June 2008 if revenues streams are adjusted by theses percentages, the Group’s result would increase or decrease by £402,000 (2007:
£71,000). 62 Cambrian Mining Plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2008
Foreign currency sensitivity analysis
The following table details the Group’s sensitivity to a 10% increase and decrease in the Sterling against the relevant foreign currencies of
US Dollar, Australian Dollar and Canadian Dollar. 10% represents management’s assessment of the reasonably possible change in foreign
exchange rates.
The sensitivity analysis includes only outstanding foreign currency denominated investments and other financial assets and liabilities and adjusts
their translation at the period end for a 10% change in foreign currency rates. The following table sets out the potential exposure, where the 10%
increase or decrease refers to a strengthening or weakening of the Sterling:

At the balance sheet date, the Group had unused tax losses of £9,752,000 (2007: £10,543,000) available for offset against future profits
equivalent to an unrecognised deferred tax asset of £2,926,000 (2007: £3,136,000), in addition to the losses recognised above. Unrecognised
deductible temporary differences in addition to those relating to associates explained below amount to £770,000 (2007: £3,515,000). No
deferred tax asset has been recognised in respect of these tax losses and temporary differences due to the unpredictability of future profit
streams. These may be carried forward indefinitely.
At the balance sheet date, the aggregate amount of unrecognised temporary differences associated with the Group’s investments in associates
Western Canadian Coal Corporation, Coal International Plc and Energybuild Group Plc, were these investment to be sold at carrying value, was
£32,972,000 deductible (2007: £21,363,000 taxable). No deferred tax asset has been recognised since as at 30 June 2008 it was not
considered likely that the reversal of the differences would occur in the future.
At the balance sheet date, the aggregate amount of undistributed earnings of group subsidiary Deepgreen Minerals Corporation Limited for
which a deferred tax liability has not been recognised was £57,304,000 (2007: £37,231,000). Although the undistributed earnings have been
subject to tax in Australia, an additional tax liability may crystallise were they to be repatriated from Australia to the United Kingdom.

directors and staff, and other payroll matters in prior years. An additional £193,000 (2007: £693,000) related to PAYE is within accruals.
The employee entitlements provision represents management’s best estimate of the Group’s liability for annual leave and long service leave.
The restoration provision relates to the Costerfield mine site, which is owned by AGD Mining Limited. The provision has been calculated based on
the present value of the expected future cash flows associated with rehabilitation and restoration activities, as stipulated by the Australian Mines
department, using a discount rate of 7%. The total provision relates to plant site ‘clean-up’ activities, treatment of tailings dams and monitoring
and maintenance of the site post-closure.
The directors consider the provision to be the best estimate of obligations which existed at the balance sheet date. 64 Cambrian Mining Plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2008

Share-based payment reserve
This reserve is used to record the value of equity benefits provided to employees and directors as part of their remuneration and provided to
consultants and advisors hired by the Group from time to time as part of the consideration paid. See note 35 for further details.
Revaluation reserve
The revaluation reserve arose as a result of piecemeal acquisitions during prior years of Deepgreen Minerals Corporation Limited, AGD Mining
Limited and Xtract International Limited (formerly Cambrian Oil and Gas Limited), reflecting the increase in the fair value of the interests held
prior to Cambrian Mining Plc obtaining control.
Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued Cambrian Mining Plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2008 67
Available for sale investments reserve
This reserve is used to record the post-tax fair value movements in available for sale investments.
Foreign currency translation reserve
The foreign currency translation reserve is used to record exchange differences arising from the translation of the financial statements of foreign
subsidiaries and associates.
Merger reserve
The merger reserve was created in accordance with the merger relief provisions under Section 131 of the Companies Act 1985 (as amended)
relating to accounting for business combinations involving the issue of shares at a premium. In preparing Group consolidated financial
statements, the amount by which the fair value of the shares issued exceeded their nominal value was recorded within a merger reserve on
consolidation, rather than in a share premium account.
Convertible loan notes reserve
This reserve is used to record the equity component of the convertible loan notes and the corresponding deferred tax for Western Canadian Coal
Corporation and Coal International.
Treasury shares reserve
The Company holds 350,000 of its own shares bought back from the market at prices from £1.1475 to £1.19 per share during the year ended
30 June 2007. These shares are held at cost as part of equity in the treasury shares reserve.
Capital redemption reserve
The balance on the capital redemption reserve represents the aggregate value of all the ordinary shares repurchased.

Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued Cambrian Mining Plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2008 69
Associate contingencies
On 21 March 2005 the Group’s associate, Western Canadian Coal Corp. (‘Western Canadian Coal’) filed a petition in the Supreme Court of British
Columbia (‘Supreme Court’) to have the Supreme Court set aside a Royalty Sharing Agreement (‘RSA’) dated 31 March 2000 entered into
between Western Canadian Coal and three individuals, two of whom are former directors of Western Canadian Coal. The Petition was heard in
the British Columbia Supreme Court in February 2006 and the Court dismissed the petition. On 24 March 2006 Western Canadian Coal filed a
notice of appeal with the Court and in October 2006 Western Canadian Coal notified the respondents that it was abandoning its appeal but was
not altering its position that the RSA was granted in consideration for advances made to Western Canadian Coal and that as such the three
individuals were not entitled to receive any royalty payment that represents in excess of 60% interest per annum as provided in section 347 of
the Criminal Code of Canada.
On 19 January 2007 one of the royalty holders initiated a petition against Western Canadian Coal in the Supreme Court to obtain certain rulings
from the court relating to whether Western Canadian Coal is obliged to make further payments to him pursuant to the terms of the RSA. On
27 July 2007 a second royalty holder initiated a similar petition. The third individual has indicated that he will consider himself bound by any
decision of the Court made in the original petition.
On 2 March 2007 Western Canadian Coal filed an application to the Supreme Court seeking to convert the original petition to an action to be
heard by trial. This application and subsequent appeals were dismissed.
In May 2008 Western Canadian Coal brought an application seeking the right to cross-examine two of the claimants in respect of extrinsic
evidence being relied upon in the claimants’ petitions. This was granted and the hearing of the petitions was held in September 2008 at which
time the Judge hearing the matter reserved judgment.
On 6 June 2008 a writ of summons and statement of claim was issued by Endeavour Financial International Corporation (‘Endeavour’) as plaintiff
in the Supreme Court against Western Canadian Coal Corp and the Company as defendants. The statement of claim alleges that Western
Canadian Coal breached the terms of engagement letters it entered into with Endeavour and that the Company wrongfully induced and procured
Western Canadian Coal to do so. The engagement letters related to the provision of services related to debt transactions and services related to
merger and acquisition transactions.
Endeavour has claimed damages arising from the termination of the engagement letters amounting to success fees that it allegedly would have
earned had the engagements not been terminated in the amount of C$1.5 million in respect of two debt transactions plus an amount
representing the Black-Scholes valuation of options which they allege were to be issued under the terms of the debt transaction plus any
success fees that Endeavour would be entitled to under the debt transaction up to 24 April 2009 and up to 24 October 2008 in respect of the
merger and acquisition transaction.
The Company and Western Canadian Coal have each filed a Statement of Defence denying all allegations and stating that Endeavour is not
entitled to a success fee of any kind, nor is it entitled to any damages or further remunerations and asking that the action be dismissed with
costs. The total liability of the Company and Western Canadian Coal, if any, associated with this claim is indeterminate at this point.
35 Share-based payments
Equity-settled share option scheme
The Group issues share options to its directors and employees. Share options have also been issued to consultants and advisors hired by the
Group from time to time as part of the consideration paid for the services received. Options are exercisable at a price and on terms as determined
by the Board on the date of grant.
Details of the share options outstanding during the year are as follows
Weighted Weighted
Number of Average Number of Average
Share Exercise Share Exercise
Options Price (in £) Options Price (in £)

Exercisable at the end of the period 4,925,000 1.60 3,800,000 1.60
The weighted average share price at the date of exercise for share options exercised during the period was £2.62 (2007: £nil per share). The
options outstanding at 30 June 2008 have a weighted average exercise price of £1.60 (2007: £1.60), and a weighted average remaining
contractual life of 1.45 years (2007: 2.26 years). 70 Cambrian Mining Plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2008
Fair values of options granted during the year ended 30 June 2008 have been estimated using the binomial lattice model, and for the year ended
30 June 2007 using the Black-Scholes model, taking into account the terms and conditions upon which the options were granted. The details
including grant dates and other inputs into the model and the resulting fair values calculated are set out as follows:
Date of grants 13/11/06 26/09/07 22/04/08 29/04/08
Expiry date 4/10/09 31/07/10 31/07/10 31/07/10

Quoted share price on date of grants £1.31 £1.00 £1.49 £1.46
Weighted average exercise price £1.60 £1.60 £1.60 £1.60
Expected volatility 70.0% 47.69% 53.7% 53.6%
Expected life 2.89 years 2.7 years 2.3 years 2.3 years
Risk-free rate 5.18% 5.07% 4.45% 4.45%
Expected dividend yields 1.15% 0.00% 0.00% 0.00%
Fair value per option granted £0.462 £0.197 £0.453 £0.430
Aggregate fair value £1,756,000 £354,000 £68,000 £43,000
Expected volatility was determined by calculating the historical volatility of the Company’s share price measured over a time period equal in
length to the expected life of the option, up to the grant date. The expected life used in the model has been adjusted, based on management’s
best estimate, for the effects of non-transferability, exercise restrictions, and behavioural considerations.
The Group recognised total expenses of £664,000 (2007: £1,818,000) related to equity-settled share-based payment transactions. Included
within the current-year expense is £200,000 which relates to options issued by Xtract Energy during the year. The amount recognised in equity
relating to share-based payments at the balance sheet date was £7,290,000 (2007: £4,186,000).
Warrants
No new warrants were granted during the year (2007: 750,000). The fair value per warrant granted was therefore £nil (2007: £0.604) and the
aggregate fair value at grant date was £nil (2007: £453,000).
36 Events after the balance sheet date
(i) Events after balance sheet date
• On 14 July 2008 Coal International Plc announced shareholder approval of the proposed acquisition by Cambrian Mining Plc of the whole
of the issued and to be issued ordinary share capital of Coal International Plc (other than Coal International shares held by Cambrian or
Cambrian Investment Holdings Ltd) to be implemented by way of a scheme of arrangement under section 899 of the Companies Act
2006 (‘the Scheme’). On 31 July 2008 the High Court sanctioned the Scheme without modification and the Scheme became effective
on 1 August 2008.
Upon the Scheme becoming effective:
• all Coal International Plc shares (other than those held by Cambrian and CIH) were cancelled and an equivalent number were issued
to Cambrian; and
• 19,704,194 new ordinary shares of Cambrian were issued to Coal International Plc shareholders (other than Cambrian and CIH) on
the register at 6.00pm on 30 July 2008 on the basis of 1 Cambrian share for every 3.25 shares held at that time.
• From 4 August 2008 the trading of Coal International Plc shares on the Alternative Investment Market of the London Stock Exchange
was cancelled and the company was re-registered as Coal International Limited. As a result of the acquisition of Coal International,
Cambrian now has a 50.6% controlling interest in Energybuild Group Plc and Energybuild Group Plc has therefore become a subsidiary of
Cambrian on the same date as the Coal transaction. Refer to Note 36 (ii) for the further details of the acquisitions.
• On 1 August 2008, Cambrian Mining Plc entered into an agreement with Coal International whereby the existing convertible loan and
working capital facilities described in Note 25 were repaid and redrawn under a new working capital facility. The new facility has a five
year term and bears interest at LIBOR plus 4%. There is no convertible feature under the new facility.
• On 31 July 2008, Coal International’s wholly owned subsidiary ADC entered into a Stock Purchase Agreement with Ebner Energy USA LLC
for the sale of Deepgreen West Virginia Inc, a wholly owned subsidiary of ADC. The agreement provided for the sale of 25,000 of
common stock, which constitute 100% of the issued and outstanding capital of Deepgreen West Virginia Inc for a purchase consideration
of US$1,400,000 in cash and a royalty of $1.00 per ton. In addition to the purchase consideration, Ebner Energy USA LLC agreed to pay
US$611,813 in consideration for a performance bond held by Deepgreen West Virginia Inc and US$9,200 in consideration for a labour
bond. The transaction resulted in a gain on sale of US$160,000 which is to be recognised during the year ending 30 June 2009.
• On 2 July 2008 the Company disposed of 36,500,000 shares and 36,500,000 warrants in its subsidiary Xtract Energy Plc. The Group’s
ownership interest in Xtract reduced from 50.1% to 45.2% resulting in Xtract ceasing to be a subsidiary and becoming an associate.
• In July 2008 Xtract entered into an agreement to establish a joint venture operation with Merty Energy, Petroleum Exploration,
Education and Services (‘Merty’), Inc, a Turkish company. Xtract has signed a definitive agreement with Merty to establish a new company
in which Xtract would initially take a 20% holding, with the opportunity to increase this before 30 June 2009. Xtract contributed
US$5 million to date.
Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued Cambrian Mining Plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2008 71
• Subsequent to year end, Zhibek Resources Limited (‘Zhibek’), a subsidiary company of Xtract served notice of their intent to terminate
the service agreement in regard to the Beshkent -Togap water injection project. The result of this action is to cease operations in regard
to the project and therefore, all assets held in relation to this project have been written off. Refer to note 16 for further details.
• On the 23 July 2008, Xtract established a joint venture company with Alraed Limited Investment Holding Company WLL, to evaluate and
develop oil shale projects in Morocco. Xtract has a 70% ownership stake in the joint venture.
• In the period subsequent to year end the share price of Xtract’s available for sale investment MEO Australia has declined from
AUD $0.495 at 30 June 2008 to AUD $0.16 at 31 October 2008. This has an impact of reducing the value of that investment and
available for sale reserve of £10,203,413 at prevailing exchange rates. Management of Xtract do not see this as a permanent decrease
in the value of this investment, therefore there is no impact to the income statement of this movement.
• On 16 July 2008 Energybuild Group Plc awarded 7,500,000 options to management and executive directors under approved and
unapproved schemes.
• WCCC announced on 1 August 2008 that it had repaid the US$30 million short term debt facility funded from operating cash flows.
• WCCC announced in October 2008 that during September 2008 40,768,999 shares had been issued as a result of warrant and
convertible debenture exercises.
• In the period subsequent to year end the share price of WCCC’s has declined from C$8.96 at 30 June 2008 to C$1.80 at 31 October
2008. This has the effect of significantly reversing the gains and losses on derivative valuations that have been disclosed in note 1.
Management do not consider that this share price decline indicates a permanent decrease in the value of this investment.
• In September 2008, the Company exercised 520,000 warrants in WCCC. Following the exercise the Group ownership interest in WCCC
is approximately 39.4%.
• On 12 November 2008, Xtract announced the completion of a farm-in agreement with Santos International Holdings Pty Ltd (‘Santos’),
a subsidiary of Santos Limited, with Xtract’s wholly owned subsidiary, Zhibek Resources Limited (‘Zhibek’). Under the terms of the
agreement, Santos will fund up to US$8.5 million of Zhibek’s near-term exploration programme, to earn a 75% interest in Zhibek. Santos
will assume operatorship and control of Zhibek. Xtract will retain representation on the board of Zhibek and will contribute up to
US$1.5 million to Zhibek’s funding in the latter stages of the current exploration programme.
(ii) Acquisitions subsequent to balance sheet date
Acquisition of Coal International Plc
Since 12 December 2005, when the Group acquired a 36.09% interest, Coal International Plc (‘Coal International’) has been accounted as
an associate.
As described in note 36 (i), on 1 August 2008, the Group acquired, by way of a scheme of arrangement, the remaining issued share capital
of Coal International Plc. As the prevailing market price at this date was £2.07 the total consideration was £40,787,681.

properties acquired, and ensuing deferred tax adjustments; and
• Revaluation of the associate interests from their carrying value to quoted market value and ensuing deferred tax adjustments.

of 34.48%.
The revaluation of Coal International’s net assets to fair value relating to the acquisition in August 2008 amounted to an increase of
£14,769,000 of which £8,156,000 related to the 34.38% previously held. This amount has been recognised as a revaluation reserve.

The fair value adjustments reflect the following:
• Uplift to intangible mineral rights to the value the directors consider is appropriate based on the underlying cash flows of the mining
properties acquired, and ensuing deferred tax adjustments; and
• Deferred income was adjusted as it was concluded that there was £nil value attributable to grants previously received by Energybuild
under the Coal Investment Aid Scheme. The amount included as a liability within Energybuild reflected the amount of deferred income
remaining to be recognised over the term of the grant. However, as the fixed assets of the group are acquired at fair value, there is no
similar liability to the group on acquisition.
The result of the previous step acquisitions was as follows:

Mark Burridge Director
Company balance sheet
as at 30 June 2008
  38 Significant accounting policies
Basis of preparation
The Company balance sheet and related notes have been prepared in accordance with United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practices
(UK GAAP) and the Companies Act 1985. The financial statements have been prepared on an historical cost basis.
No profit and loss account is presented by the Company as permitted by section 230 of the Companies Act 1985 and the Company has taken
the exemption under FRS 1 not to present a cash flow statement.
The principal accounting policies adopted are the same as those set out in note 2 to the consolidated financial statements except as noted below.
Investment in subsidiaries and associates
Investments in subsidiaries and associates are stated at cost less, where appropriate, provisions for impairment.
Listed and unlisted investments
The Company’s investments in listed and unlisted securities are stated at cost less, where appropriate, provisions for impairment.
Current asset investments
Current asset investments comprise of the Company’s investments in securities which are held for short-term returns. These are measured at
lower of cost and net realisable value.
Convertible debentures and notes
Convertible loans are initially recognised at fair value less directly attributable costs of issue. After initial recognition, the debentures and notes
are measured at amortised cost, under the effective interest rate method. The effective interest rate is determined as the rate that discounts the
total cash flows over the life of the instrument to the value of the liability recognised on initial recognition.
Taxation
The tax expense represents the sum of the tax currently payable and deferred tax.
Current tax is based on the taxable profit for the year. T axable profit differs from net profit as reported in the profit and loss account because it
excludes items of income or expense that are taxable or deductible in other years and it further excludes items that are never taxable or
deductible. The Company’s liability for current tax is calculated using tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance
sheet date.
Deferred tax is recognised in respect of all timing differences that have originated but not reversed at the balance sheet date, where transactions
or events have occurred at that date that will result in an obligation to pay more, or right to pay less or to receive more, tax.
Deferred tax assets are recognised for all deductible temporary differences, carry forward of unused tax assets and unused tax losses to the
extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available against which deductible temporary differences and the carry forward of unused
tax credits and unused tax losses can be utilised.
Deferred tax is measured on an undiscounted basis at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the periods in which timing differences reverse,
based on tax rates and laws enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
Share-based payments
The Company issues equity-settled share-based payments to certain employees. The Company has applied the requirements of FRS 20 Share-
based payment.
The details of the share-based payments are included in note 35 to the consolidated financial statements.
The standard requires options granted to be measured at fair value at grant date using an option pricing model and charged to the profit and loss
account over the vesting period of the option.
Reclassification of comparatives
Unlisted debentures and convertible loan notes presented as investments in the year ended 30 June 2007, are now considered to be most
appropriately classified as loans receivable within debtors, consistent with the presentation in the consolidated financial statements.
Comparative amounts included in the Company balance sheet and in notes 40 and 41 have been reclassified accordingly.

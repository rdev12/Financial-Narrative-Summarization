Annual Report and Accounts 2009 Welcome to Cohort
Cohort is an AIM listed independent 
technology business operating 
in defence and related markets.
It was formed in 2006 as a holding

capitalising on the growing demand 
in the United Kingdom and overseas, 
for independent technical advice and 
cost effective and flexible supply of 
niche products and services.
It now has three well established, 
wholly owned subsidiaries providing 
a wide range of services and

   Shareholder Information and Financial Calendar Cohort’s strategic aim is to build up 
a group of complementary companies 
supplying technical advice, managed 
services, niche products and software 
to growth segments of defence and 
related markets, sharing the following 
core characteristics:
I Independent
I Technically expert
I Practically oriented
I Flexible
I Cost‑effective
I Growing
The accessible market for such services and products 
is large because of growing technical complexity, 
the outsourcing of scientific and technical expertise 
by Government to the private sector and the consolidation 
of the supply chain, particularly at prime and first 
tier level, all of which have increased the need of 
government for independent sources of advice and 
created new opportunities for niche suppliers of 
technical services and products. We aim to make 
targeted acquisitions of companies which have good 
management and technology but which can benefit 
from being part of a group with a larger balance sheet 
and a wider customer base. Our management approach 
provides a high level of operating autonomy for 
subsidiaries whilst ensuring the degree of financial 
oversight required for a quoted company and the 
exchange of information and practices which make 
the Group greater than the sum of its parts.

business. The Board is grateful to Stanley for 
his immense contribution to the success of 
Cohort to date.

Cohort’s trading this year has continued 
the successful trend of last year. All three 
companies have achieved record annual 
revenues	and	profits.
In	the	year	ended	30	 April	2009,	Cohort

Group overview
Cohort is an independent group whose 
constituent companies provide a wide range 
of technical advice, support and managed 
services and certain niche products, 
characterised by high tech design and 
low volume manufacture. It provides 
an environment in which companies can 
develop and continue to grow whilst retaining 
a high degree of autonomy and deriving 
benefit	from	being	part	of	the	wider	Group.	
We continue to seek opportunities to acquire 
complementary businesses. These may be 
either large enough to operate as an 
additional member within the Group or 
smaller businesses that can be integrated 
with one of the existing members.
Cohort’s well established businesses have 
continued to expand successfully through 
a combination of innovation, responsiveness 
and agility. Building from their core markets 
of defence and security, Cohort companies 
now provide technology and services in such 
markets as space, transport and offshore 
t e c h n o l o g y . 	 I n 	 a n 	 u n c e r t a i n 	 fi n a n c i a l 	 c l i m a t e ,	
this diversity both across the Group and 
within the individual companies, coupled 
with the ability to keep well abreast of 
and sometimes lead technology, enables 
us to respond quickly to market needs. 
W e	are	confident	the	Group	is	well	placed	
to continue to grow both organically, as 
demonstrated this year and by acquisition.
Trading subsidiaries
MASS
MASS	Consultants	Limited	(MASS)	is	an	
independent systems house with a strong 
defence focus, including the design and 
manufacture of niche technology products.
Based	in	St	Neots	near	Cambridge	with	an

was	founded	in	1983.	It	is	well	known	in	
the	field	of	electronic	warfare,	secure

Lowes,	a	founder	of	MASS,	have	remained	
in	post	since	the	acquisition	in	 August	2006.
MASS	has	had	a	strong	year ,	securing	a	niche	
position with a number of prime contracts 
in	being	a	first	choice	systems	house	for	
outsourced technologically demanding design 
and	development.	MASS	continued	to	support	
its key managed service customers in the 
United	K ingdom	MOD	and	overseas.
In	Electronic	W arfare	(EW),	MASS	continued

Chief Executive’s Report
Stanley Carter Co-Chairman
Andrew Thomis Chief Executive
“ the Group remains agile and responsive 
to the needs of its customers. Cohort 
continues to exploit its position in 
key niche markets where customer 
need and focus remains high.” 05
Cohort plc Annual Report and Accounts 2009
MASS	finished	the	year	by	being	selected	
as preferred bidder to provide the ICT 
implementation and managed service for 
North	Lincolnshire’ s	Building	Schools	for	
the Future programme. This programme 
should be on contract in the late summer. 
MASS	enters	an	important	year	with	
the renewal of its UKSF managed service 
provision and its part in the development 
of the United Kingdom’s new EW database 
as key objectives.
SCS
Systems	Consultants	Services	Limited	(SCS)	
is an independent technical advisory and 
managed service business operating primarily 
in the defence and security sectors. Its 
personnel have the appropriate technical 
expertise combined with practical experience 
of its application in the user domain. Over 
70%	of	its	employees	have	served	in	the	
Armed Forces.
Based in Henley-on-Thames, SCS was founded 
in	1992	and	has	consistently	grown	year	on	
year .	2008/9	was	no	exception,	with	another	
near	20%	growth	in	revenue.
Notable	contract	awards	during	the	year	
included winning the re-competition of 
the United Kingdom Land Command 
Brigade	Mission	R ehearsal	exercises,	
training	provision	to	the	R oyal	Saudi	 Air	
Force, technical and procurement support 
to	the	P olice	National	CBRN	Centre	and,	
along	with	MASS	and	SEA,	forming	part	
of the team leading a key United Kingdom 
MOD	concept	study .
Over the last few years SCS has invested in 
its internal system and business development 
resource. These investments have now begun 
to	show	a	return,	with	19%	revenue	growth	
driving	profit	growth	of	over	40%	this	year ,	
much of it from higher utilisation of core staff. 
SEA
SEA 	(Group)	Limited	(SEA)	is	an	independent	
systems engineering and software company 
operating in the defence, space, transport 
and	off-shore	markets.	Founded	in	1988,	
it is based in Beckington near Frome, 
S o m e r s e t 	 with	further	offices	close	to	the	
main	United	K ingdom	MOD	establishment	
in	Bristol.	During	the	year	SEA ’ s	sales	grew	
by	18%	over	the	equivalent	period	for	2008,	
producing	a	record	profit	for	the	business.
SEA continued to develop its offering in defence, 
securing a number of key programmes in its 
traditional 	 maritime 	 markets, 	 including 	 DAR T 	
and an underwater detection system for the 
French	Navy .	In	other	defence	areas,	SEA 	
continued to lead on a number of land based 
research programmes, which have the potential 
to pull through our own technology, as well 
as securing a software simulation programme 
for land based training and simulation. 
In the space market, SEA continued 
to progress its broad band radiometer 
instrument for the European Space Agency’s 
Earth	Care	Mission	as	well	as	securing	
elements of a number of other programmes 
including the European Sentinel 3 mission.
In transport, SEA successfully launched its 
R oadflow product with sales to a number 
of local authorities in the United Kingdom. 
Prospects for the product going forward look 
promising and SEA continues to develop both 
the	R oadflow product and its wider offering 
in 	 the 	 area 	 of 	 traffic 	 enforcement.
Outlook
Against an uncertain international and 
economic background, the Group remains agile 
and responsive to the needs of its customers. 
Cohort continues to exploit its position in 
key niche markets where customer need and 
focus remains high. The Group is diverse and 
is in a good business position with a strong 
order	book.	W e	are	confident	that	the	wide	
ranging and complementary expertise and 
capabilities we have in the Cohort Group 
make it well positioned to continue to grow, 
both organically and through acquisition, 
to meet changing market needs.

Cohort plc Annual Report and Accounts 2009
The following review explains in further 
detail	the	significant	financial	issues	arising	
during	the	year	ended	30	 April	2009	and	
highlights other matters over and above 
what	is	included	in	the	primary	financial	
statements and accompanying notes.
Revenue
The 	 segmental 	 analysis 	 (note 	 1) 	 presents 	 the	
Group’s revenue by subsidiary. The revenue is 
further analysed as shown in the table opposite.
The change in the revenue by sector is 
due to reporting a full year of SEA, which 
has	approximately	40%	of	its	business	in	
non-defence sectors. 
Adjusted operating profit
T h e 	 a d j u s t e d 	 o p e r a t i n g 	 p r o fi t 	 i s 	 presented	
to	reflect	the	trading	profit	of	the	Group	
and excludes amortisation of other intangible 
assets, share of result of joint ventures and 
exceptional items. This allows the Group 
to present its trading performance in a 
comparable format year on year.
The	adjusted	operating	profit	is	stated	after	
charging the cost of share-based payments 
of	£184,000	(2008:	£129,000)	which	is	
allocated to each business in proportion 
to its employee participation in the 
Group’s share option schemes.
Finance Director’s Review
Simon Walther Finance	Director 07
Cohort plc Annual Report and Accounts 2009
The	adjusted	operating	profit	of	SEA 	(and	
the	Group)	is	after	a	net	charge	of	£57,000	
(2008:	credit	of	£131,000)	in	respect	of	
marking forward foreign exchange contracts 
to	market	at	30	 April	2009	and	revaluing	
currency monetary assets and liabilities at 
the year end. The forward foreign exchange 
contracts are used to hedge the forward 
sale of currency on Euro denominated 
trading contracts.
Tax
The Group’s tax charge for the year ended 
3 0 	 A p r i l 	 2 0 0 9 	 o f 	 £ 1 , 3 7 2 , 0 0 0 	 ( 2 0 0 8 : 	 £ 1 , 0 8 9 , 0 0 0 )	
w a s 	 a t 	 a n 	 e f f e c t i v e 	 r a t e 	 o f 	 2 1 . 3 % 	 ( 2 0 0 8 : 	 1 9 . 6 % )	
of	profit	before	tax.	 This	includes	a	current	
year	corporation	tax	charge	of	£1,299,000	
( 2 0 0 8 : 	 £ 7 1 0 , 0 0 0 ) , 	 a 	 r a t e 	 o f 	 2 0 . 1 % 	 ( 2 0 0 8 : 	 1 2 . 7 % )	
o f 	 p r o fi t 	 b e f o r e 	 t a x 	 a n d 	 a 	 d e f e r r e d 	 t a x 	 c h a r g e	
of	£73,000	(2008:	charge	of	£379,000).
The Group’s overall tax rate was below 
the	standard	corporation	tax	rate	of	28%.	
The majority of the reduction in the 
effective rate of tax was due to the 
recognition of research and development 
( R & D ) 	 c r e d i t s 	 a t 	 M A S S 	 a n d 	 S E A 	 f o r 	 t h e 	 y e a r	
ended	30	 April	2009.	
The Group’s businesses are only allowed to 
claim	the	lower	R&D	tax	credit	allowance	
available	to	larger	companies,	currently	30%,	
and this accounts for the higher current year 
c o r p o r a t i o n 	 t a x 	 r a t e 	 c o m p a r e d 	 w i t h 	 2 0 0 8 	 w h e n	
the Group was able to receive the larger relief 
available to smaller and medium sized entities.
SCS and the Group’s joint venture AGS applied 
for	and	received	R&D	tax	credits	during	2009	
for earlier periods. These credits have not 
yet been recognised in the tax charge as 
the	matter	is	still	to	be	finalised.	
Looking forward, the Group’s tax charge may 
fall further over the next year or two subject 
to outstanding claims being accepted by 
HMRC	and	recognised	by	the	Group.	Beyond	
this,	the	Group’ s	R&D	tax	credit	will	be	
at the lower rate associated with a large 
Group	(30%	uplift	on	qualifying	spend)	and	
I would expect the Group tax charge to be 
a t 	 o r 	 a r o u n d 	the	lo w	20%	level	and	c ertainly	
below	the	standard	rate	of	28%,	based	upon	
expected	R&D	spend	and	reliefs	available.
Provisions
The	Group’ s	provisions	at	30	 April	2009	
are	as	per	note	18.
The	provision	for	the	MASS	earn	out	was	
established at the time of acquisition 
(for	£500,000)	and	was	settled	in	cash	for	
£280,000	(including	costs)	on	5	June	2009.

£3.0m	was	drawn	to	part	finance	the	
acquisition of SEA and remains drawn 
at	30	 April	2009.
In	 additio n,	 the	Group	 has	 £0.8m	of 	 mortgage	
debt	with	RBS	which	was	acquired	with	SEA.
At	30	 April	2009,	the	Group	had	in	place	
forward foreign exchange contracts to sell 
Euro	4.1m	at	a	£	Sterling	equivalent	value	
of	£3.5m.
These forward contracts are used by the 
Group to manage its risk exposure to foreign 
currency on trading contracts where it either 
or both receives and pays currency from 
customers and suppliers respectively.
These contracts are entered into when contracts 
are considered effective.The Group does not 
enter into speculative foreign exchange dealing.
The Group’s bank covenants were 
all	satisfied	at	30	 April	2009.
Goodwill and other intangible assets
The Group has recognised goodwill and other 
intangible assets in respect of the acquisition 
of	MASS	and	SEA 	(see	note	10).	 The	other	
intangible assets are in respect of contracts 
acquired in each case and are to be amortised 
over the life of the earnings associated with 
the contracts acquired.
The goodwill, which is not subject to 
amortisation but to annual impairment 
testing, arises from the intangible elements 
of the acquired businesses for which either 
the value or life is not readily derived. This 
includes, but is not limited to, intellectual 
property within the acquired work force, 
reputation, customer relations, contacts and 
market synergies with existing Group members. 
The goodwill relating to the acquisitions of 
MASS	and	 SEA 	has	 been	 tested	 for	 impairment	
as	at	30	 April	2009	and	no	impairment	is	to	
be recognised in either case.

The	indicators	shown	above	have	been	identified	by	the	Directors	as	giving	the	best	overall	indication	of	the	Group’ s	long-term	success.	R evenue	growth	gives	a	quantified	
indication	of	the	rate	at	which	the	Group’ s	business	activity	is	expanding.	 An	appropriate	adjusted	profit	growth	trend	confirms	that	additional	revenue	is	being	gained	
without	profit	margins	being	compromised.	It	also	indicates	that	acquisitions	are	value	enhancing.	Order	book	visibility ,	based	upon	expected	revenue	during	the	year	
to	come,	gives	the	Board	confidence	as	to	the	achievement	of	future	growth	forecasts.	Growth	in	adjusted	earnings	per	share	is	an	absolute	measure	of	the	Board’ s	
management	of	the	Group’ s	return	to	shareholders	including	tax	and	interest.	Operating	cash	conversion	measures	the	ability	of	the	Group	to	convert	profit	to	cash	
and to enable it to use its own resources to fund further acquisitions in whole or part.
Working capital
The working capital of the Group, excluding 
provisions and tax liabilities, has risen from 
£8.0m	net	assets	to	£8.6m	net	assets,	an	
increase	of	£0.6m	(8%),	despite	a	rise	in	
revenue of 38%.
The year-end days debtors in sales have 
fallen	from	65	days	in	2008	to	52	days	in	
2009.	 This	calculation	is	based	upon	dividing	
the revenue by month, working backwards 
from April into the trade debtors balance 
(excluding unbilled income and work in 
p r o g r e s s ) 	 a t 	 t h e 	 y e a r - e n d , 	 a 	 m o r e 	 a p p r o p r i a t e	
measure as it takes into account the heavy 
weighting of the Group’s revenue in the last 
quarter of each year.
The Group has a working capital facility 
of	£2.5m	with	RBS	which	was	not	utilised	
during the year. The Group had cash at 
30	 April	2009	of	£7.5m,	(2008:	£6.1m).	
Advance receipts on contracts at the 
year	end	were	£2.5m	(2008:	£2.2m).

in particular , we have expanded our electronic 
warfare activities into the surface ship domain 
via	the	DAR T 	programme	(advanced	Radar

of rotorcraft vibration monitoring equipment. 
In the land domain we have delivered applied 
research into the dismounted close combat 
arena with some promising potential for 
delivering our own technology into this

Cohort plc is a Company incorporated in and operating from England. Its registered address is, The Court House, Northfield End, 
Henley‑on‑Thames, Oxfordshire RG9 2JN.
Share capital of the Company and transactions with shareholders
During the year, the Company issued 134,526 shares in order to satisfy employee share option plans that were exercised.
Principal activities, business review and future developments
The principal activity of the Company is that of a holding company. The principal activities of the Group are described in the 
‘About us’ section (inside front cover). The operational and financial performance of the Group as well as its risks are described 
in the Chairman’s Statement, Chief Executive’s Report, Finance Director’s Review and Operational Review on pages 2 to 15. 
The Finance Director’s review includes a review of key performance indicators. The resources, future outlook and development 
of the Group, including acquisition strategy is reviewed in the same statements on pages 2 to 15. The Group’s approach to risk 
is discussed below.
Specific matters of note
On 11 July 2008, the Group settled the SEA earn‑out of £4.7m, which was earned in full.
Results and dividend
The Group’s performance was in line with expectations.
The profit for the year of the Group after dividends paid of £627,000 (2008: £447,000) was £4,455,000 (2008: £4,033,000). 
The loss for the year of the Company after dividends paid of £627,000 (2008: £447,000) was £75,000 (2008: £648,000).
The trading performance of the Group represents the trading result of the Group’s 100% subsidiaries MASS, SCS and SEA less 
the corporate costs of the Company.
The Group’s share of the losses of its joint venture undertaking, AGS have been disclosed as ‘share of result of joint ventures’ 
and the cost of withdrawing from the AGS investment has been disclosed as an exceptional item.
The Directors recommend a final dividend of 1.2 pence (2008: 1.0 pence) per 10 pence ordinary share.
Research and development
During the year ended 30 April 2009 the Group expenditure on research and development, both funded by customers and the Group’s 
own private venture expenditure, was £7.1m (2008: £5.5m).
Approach to risk
The business risks of the Group can be summarised as follows:
External (or market) risk
The Group’s external risk is in respect of the following:
i. Customers
The Group has a number of key customers, mostly in the Government sector. These customers are served either directly e.g. 
United Kingdom MOD (MOD) (£44.3m revenue in 2009; 56% of total Group revenue) or indirectly via other contractors; in the case 
of the MOD, £16.4m of Group revenue (21%) was via other contractors. The Group continues to be reliant on its ultimate primary 
customer, the MOD (77% of Group revenue in 2009; 2008: 83%) but is reducing this reliance by expanding its overseas defence 
offering as well as other non‑defence sectors, including Space and Transport. The Group ensures it engages at all levels of the 
MOD and remains responsive to its primary customer’s needs.
ii. Suppliers
As is typical in the Defence and Space sectors, the Group is reliant on certain key suppliers for its technical and product offerings. 
This risk is managed through close liaison with suppliers, good project management and having contingency plans to go to alternative 
suppliers or bring in‑house. 
The Group has no significant reliance on any one individual supplier .
iii. Partners
The Group, especially in the Defence Sector often secures business through teaming and partnering with other suppliers and 
this is often a requirement of securing work with the MOD in order to ensure the end customer receives the best of everything.
The Group takes an active part in these arrangements to ensure that the team (including our partners) deliver as a whole and 
to the individual team members.

Cohort plc Annual Report and Accounts 2009
Approach to risk continued
Internal (or financial and operational) risk
i. Revenue
The Group takes a prudent approach to revenue and credit risk, and any work done at risk is minimal, authorised at the 
appropriate level and reviewed on a monthly basis. The calibre of the Group’s customers and the control processes in respect 
of revenue capture and invoicing ensures minimal bad debts. The 2009 bad debt charge was £Nil (2008: £12,000) on Group 
revenue of £78.6m (2008: £57.1m).
The Group also uses letters of credit and other methods of payment guarantee, including customer advances, especially in respect 
of overseas customers, to ensure any export debt risk is minimised. Any debt receivable in foreign currency is hedged using forward 
exchange contracts which are entered into when contracts are deemed effective.
       2009 2008 
Financial assets exposed to credit risk at 30 April       £m £m
Trade receivables       16.1 15.6
Other receivables       8.2 5.3
Cash and bank deposits       7.5 6.1
Financial derivatives (forward foreign exchange contracts)      3.5 2.2
Cash and bank deposits are all with the Group’s bank, RBS. Indebtedness to the bank (RBS) was £3.8m at 30 April 2009 (2008: £4.0m).
Of the trade receivables, £8.1m was with the MOD at 30 April 2009 (2008: £6.6m).
The financial derivatives at 30 April 2009 were all held with RBS.
ii. Treasury
The Group takes a very prudent approach to the management of its financial instruments which are described in note 20. 
The Group’s cash is held with at least AA rated institutions and on deposits not exceeding three months. This ensures a very 
low risk to capital and a reasonable balance of liquidity against interest earned on cash deposits.
During the year , the Group renewed its working capital facility with RBS for £2.5m. This facility is available to all of the Group’s entities 
through an offset arrangement. The current facility expires in October 2009 when it is expected to be renewed on similar terms.
The Group did not utilise this facility during the year ended 30 April 2009 having an average cash balance of £3.7m, cash balances 
ranging from a low of zero to a high of £7.5m.
iii. Currency risk
The Group manages its exposure to currency risk by using forward foreign currency exchange contracts. The level of forward cover 
is determined contract by contract taking into account the net currency exposure to receipts and purchases. Forward contracts are 
only put in place when customer contracts are deemed effective. The Group does not enter speculative forward exchange contacts.
iv. Interest rate risk
The Group considers interest rate risk loan by loan and where appropriate the Group enters interest rate swaps to fix its interest 
rate exposure.
At 30 April 2009, the Group had in place one interest rate swap against a mortgage secured on its freehold property, fixing the interest 
rate at 7.38%. The notional cost of exiting this swap to the Group at 30 April 2009 was £68,000 (see note 20).
v. Operations
The Group’s operational risk is primarily through its three subsidiaries. The subsidiary trading or business risks are similar 
in the case of MASS and SEA.
MASS and SEA
Primary risks are:
i.   Fixed price contracts – these are often of a long‑term nature (greater than twelve months) and typically include delivery of hardware 
and software. These projects are managed by dedicated project management, monthly review by the subsidiary Board and regular 
interaction with the customer and key suppliers. Margin is prudently recognised taking account of risk and cost to complete.
ii.   Due to the nature of their niche technical skills requirement, both MASS and SEA have a fixed level of core software engineering 
and technical expertise. This cost base is carefully monitored at budget time and by rolling quarterly forecasts to identify any 
potential risk of low utilisation and thus under recovery of cost. 
  The risk is mitigated, in the short‑term, to a certain extent by the use of a small number of sub‑contractor staff. In the long‑term, 
a programme of skills assessment and training is in place to ensure continued flexibility of the engineering resource. 20
Cohort plc Annual Report and Accounts 2009
Directors’ Report continued
Approach to risk continued
Internal (or financial and operational) risk continued
v. Operations continued
SCS
The primary cost risk is in respect of staff utilisation. This risk is managed by retaining a minimal core staff, essential for business 
support, development and delivering key skills to customers. The majority of deliverable service is provided by non‑core staff 
(associates) where cost is only incurred when the associates are on task earning revenue.
SCS has a small number of fixed price contracts which are managed by specifically tasked project management and reviewed 
on a monthly basis for financial performance and risk to recognised margin. The recognised margins take account of risks 
and costs to completion.
The Group (through all of its subsidiaries) operates a number of off site managed service contracts. These contracts are long‑term 
in nature (typically five years at commencement) and are managed through dedicated site project managers. The contracts are 
fixed price in terms of revenue and cost with opportunities for additional tasks enhancing volume and return. The Group carefully 
manages the partnership with its customer and supplier base in all these cases to ensure the customer receives value for money 
and skilled Group staff providing a dedicated, flexible and responsive approach. The primary risk to these managed service 
contracts is termination which is mitigated by the partnering approach adopted by the Group and our close engagement with 
the customer to ensure customer requirements remain paramount at all times.
vi. Acquisitions
The Group’s acquisition risk is mitigated as far as practicable by the acquisition process being managed at the Cohort Board level, 
making use of appropriate external expertise and resources as and when required.
Going concern
On the basis of current financial projections and facilities available to the Group, the Directors consider that the Group has adequate 
resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future. For this reason, the Directors continue to adopt the 
going concern basis in preparing the financial statements.
International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS)
The Group has reported its results for the year ended 30 April 2009 in accordance with IFRS.
Statement of Directors’ responsibilities
The Directors are responsible for preparing the Directors’ report and the financial statements in accordance with applicable law 
and regulations.
United Kingdom company law requires the Directors to prepare Group and Company Financial Statements for each financial year. 
Under that law the Directors are required to prepare Group financial statements in accordance with IFRS as adopted by the 
European Union and have elected to prepare the Company financial statements in accordance with IFRS as adopted by the 
European Union.
The Group financial statements are required by law and IFRS adopted by the European Union to present fairly the financial position 
and performance of the Group; the Companies Act 2006 provides, in relation to such financial statements, that references in the 
relevant part of that Act to financial statements giving a true and fair view are references to their achieving a fair presentation.
Under company law the Directors must not approve the financial statements unless they are satisfied that they give a true and fair 
view of the state of affairs of the Company. 
In preparing each of the Group and Company financial statements, the Directors are required to:
I  select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently;
I  make judgements and estimates that are reasonable and prudent;
I  state whether they have been prepared in accordance with IFRS adopted by the European Union; and
I  prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis unless it is inappropriate to presume that the Group and the 
Company will continue in business.
The Directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting records that are sufficient to show and explain the Group’s and 
the Company’s transactions and disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position of the Company and to enable 
them to ensure that the financial statements comply with the Companies Act 2006. They are also responsible for safeguarding 
the assets of the Group and hence for taking reasonable steps for the prevention and detection of fraud and other irregularities.
The Directors are also responsible for the maintenance and integrity of the Cohort plc website.
Legislation in the United Kingdom governing the preparation and dissemination of financial statements may differ from legislation 
in other jurisdictions. 21

The Group maintains appropriate insurance cover in respect of legal actions against the Directors, as well as against material loss 
or claims against the Group, and reviews the adequacy of the cover regularly.
Payment policy
In respect of all of its suppliers, the Group’s policy is:
I  to agree the terms of payment when contracting with suppliers;
I  to ensure suppliers are made aware of the terms of payment; and 
I  to abide by the terms of payment.
All suppliers are treated alike in terms of payment with no preference to any one supplier.
At 30 April 2009, the trade creditors of the Group represented 47 days (2008: 40 days) of purchases.
Employee involvement
The Group organises staff communications locally through its subsidiary undertakings. The media used for organised communications 
includes local intranets, in‑house magazines, staff bulletins, presentations and copies of press releases. In addition, regular staff 
meetings are held and notices are published containing information about matters of interest within the Group and its subsidiaries.
Disabled people
The policy of the Group is to offer the same opportunity to disabled people as to all others in respect of recruitment and career 
advancement, provided their disability does not prevent them from carrying out their required duties. Employees who become 
disabled will, wherever possible, be retained, rehabilitated and where necessary retrained.
Donations
During the year ended 30 April 2009 the Group made charitable donations of £3,961 (2008: £11,535), mainly in respect of military 
and local charities. The Group made no political donations during the year (2008: £Nil).
Post balance sheet events
On 5 June 2009, the Group settled the MASS earn‑out at £280,000 including costs.
Auditor
A resolution to re‑appoint Baker Tilly UK Audit LLP as auditor will be proposed at the Annual General Meeting (AGM). The Directors 
who were in office on the date of approval of these financial statements have confirmed, as far as they are aware, that there is no 
relevant audit information of which the auditor is unaware. Each of the Directors have confirmed that they have taken all the steps 
they ought to have taken as Directors in order to make themselves aware of any relevant audit information and to establish that it 
has been communicated to the auditor.

Corporate Governance Report
Introduction
As Cohort plc is listed on AIM it is neither required to comply with the Combined Code 2006 (the Code) nor issue a statement 
of compliance with it. Nevertheless, the Board fully supports the principles set out in the Code and seeks to comply wherever 
this is appropriate, having regard to the size of the Company and the resources available to it. Details are provided below of how 
the Company applies the Code.
The Board
The Board of Directors comprises two Executive Directors and three Non‑executive Directors, Nick Prest (Chairman), Stanley Carter 
(Co‑Chairman from 25 May 2009) and Sir Robert Walmsley. The Chairman and the Co‑Chairman have consultancy agreements with 
the Company (see the Remuneration & Appointments committee report on page 24) to provide services, primarily in respect of 
strategic business development and acquisition activity. This agreement allows for a minimum of 20 days’ service in any one year. 
Nick Prest and Stanley Carter are not considered independent.
The Board has determined Sir Robert Walmsley to be independent and he is designated the Senior Independent Director.
The Board meets most months and receives a Board pack comprising individual reports from each of the Executive Directors and 
the subsidiary Managing Directors together with any other material deemed necessary for the Board to discharge its duties. It is the 
Board’s responsibility to formulate, review and approve the Group’s strategy, budgets, major items of expenditure and acquisitions.
All Directors retire by rotation and are subject to election by shareholders at intervals of no more than three years.
Board committees
The Board has established two committees: Audit, and Remuneration & Appointments, each having written terms of delegated responsibilities.
Audit committee
The Audit committee comprises the Non‑executive Directors and is scheduled to meet at least twice a year. It is the Audit committee’s 
role to provide formal and transparent arrangements for considering how to apply the financial reporting and internal control 
requirements of the Code, whilst maintaining an appropriate relationship with the independent auditor of the Group. In order 
to comply with the requirement of the Code that at least one member has relevant financial experience, the Chairman of the 
Board sits on the Audit committee. 
The independent auditor liaises with the Audit committee regarding work to be undertaken and complies with the Ethical Standards 
for Auditors issued by the Auditing Practice Board. Each year, prior to commencing its audit work, the independent auditor confirms 
in writing the nature of its non‑audit work on behalf of the Group and the safeguards in place to ensure its independence 
and objectivity.
Remuneration & Appointments committee
The Remuneration & Appointments committee comprises the Non‑executive Directors and is scheduled to meet at least once a year. 
It is the Remuneration & Appointments committee’s role to establish a formal and transparent policy on Executive remuneration 
and to set remuneration packages for individual Directors.
Sir Robert Walmsley is Chairman of both the Audit and Remuneration & Appointments committees.
The attendance of the Directors at Board and committee meetings for the year ended 30 April 2009 was as follows:
      Remuneration 
    Board Audit & Appointments
N Prest (Chairman)    9/9 4/4 3/3
Sir Robert Walmsley (Non‑executive Director)    9/9 4/4 3/3
S Carter (Chief Executive to 24 May 2009 and Co‑Chairman from 25 May 2009)  9/9 — —
S Walther (Finance Director and Company Secretary)    9/9 — —
I Dale‑Staples (Director) (resigned 24 June 2009)    9/9 — —
The Board has not established a Nominations committee. This is not considered necessary due to the small size of the Cohort Board. 
The role of the Nominations committee is undertaken by the Remuneration & Appointments committee and the Chief Executive.  23
Cohort plc Annual Report and Accounts 2009
Management of the Group and its subsidiary undertakings
The management of the Group and subsidiary undertakings is as follows:
Group management
I  Cohort plc Board meeting at least eight times per year.
I  Group Executive committee meeting at least four times per year, comprising Cohort plc Executive Directors and subsidiary 
Managing Directors.
Subsidiary management
I  Monthly executive management meetings involving subsidiary Board and senior management.
Cohort Executive Directors have the right to attend all subsidiary executive management meetings.
Shareholder relations
The Company meets with its institutional shareholders and analysts as appropriate and will use the AGM to encourage communication 
with private shareholders. In addition, the Company uses the Annual Report and Accounts, interim statement and website 
(www.cohortplc.com) to provide further information to shareholders.
Internal control and risk management
The Board is responsible for the system of internal control and for reviewing its effectiveness. Such systems are designed to 
manage rather than eliminate risks and can provide only reasonable and not absolute assurance against material misstatement 
or loss. Each year, on behalf of the Board, the Audit committee will review the effectiveness of these systems. This is achieved 
primarily by considering the risks potentially affecting the Group and from discussions with the external auditor.
The Group does not currently have an internal audit function due to the small size of the administrative function and the high level 
of Director review and authorisation of transactions.
A comprehensive budgeting process is completed once a year, reviewed and approved by the Board. In addition the Group conducts 
quarterly re‑forecasts. The Group’s results, as compared against budget and the latest quarterly forecast, are reported to the Board 
on a monthly basis and discussed in detail at each meeting of the Board. 24
Cohort plc Annual Report and Accounts 2009
Remuneration & Appointments Committee Report
Introduction
Companies quoted on AIM are not required to provide a formal remuneration report. However, in line with current best practice 
this report provides information to enable a greater level of understanding as to how Directors’ remuneration is determined.
The Remuneration & Appointments committee of the Board is responsible for considering Directors’ remuneration packages and 
makes its recommendations to the Board. The committee comprises the Non‑executive Directors and meets at least once a year.
Remuneration policy
Remuneration packages are designed to be competitive and to reward above average performance.
Executive Directors receive salary, medical cover, pension contribution, annual bonuses and share options.
Service contracts of the Executive Directors who served in the year
Simon Walther has a service agreement with the Company which can be cancelled by either party giving six months’ notice at any 
time or twelve months’ notice in the event of a change of control arising as a result of any person or persons acquiring more than 
50% of the voting rights at a general meeting of the Company. Stanley Carter had a service agreement with the Company which 
could be cancelled by either party giving six months’ notice at any time or twelve months’ notice in the event of a change of control 
arising as a result of any person or persons acquiring more than 50% of the voting rights at a general meeting of the Company, which 
ceased upon his change of role on 25 May 2009 (see below). Ian Dale‑Staples had a service contract with Systems Engineering and 
Assessment Limited which conferred similar rights to those of the other Executive Directors of the Company.
Pensions
The Group makes contributions to the Company’s stakeholder pension scheme (a defined contribution scheme) at a rate of 10.0% 
of the Executive Director’s contribution. In the case of Ian Dale‑Staples, the Group made contributions to the Systems Engineering 
and Assessment Limited pension scheme (a defined contribution scheme) at a rate of 5.0% of salary plus 10.0% of the Executive 
Directors’ contribution.
Performance incentives (audited)
The Group operates a cash bonus scheme and grants share options.
A bonus of £55,320 was payable to the Executive Directors for the year ended 30 April 2009 (2008: £52,500).

Goodwill arises on the acquisition of subsidiaries. These subsidiaries are the cash‑generating units to which goodwill has been allocated.
The goodwill recognised on acquisition of a subsidiary in the period ended 30 April 2008 relates to the acquisition of SEA. This goodwill 
was originally recognised on acquisition (31 October 2007) at £18,492,000 and revised during the twelve months ended 31 October 2008 
by the provision of £402,000 in respect of losses associated with acquired contracts and a further £1,000 of acquisition costs in respect 
of the settlement of the SEA earn‑out.
The adjustment to other intangible assets of previously acquired subsidiaries reflects the settlement of the MASS earn‑out at 
£280,000 (including costs), £220,000 less than the provision (£500,000) established at the time of acquisition. The amortisation 
has been adjusted accordingly. 36

For the year ended 30 April 2009
10. Goodwill and other intangible assets continued
The amortisation charge described on page 35 is disclosed as ‘Amortisation of other intangible assets’ in the income statement.
The Group tests goodwill annually for impairment, or more frequently if there are indications that goodwill might be impaired.
The recoverable amounts of the subsidiaries (cash generating units) are determined from value in use calculations.
The key assumptions for the value in use calculations are those regarding discount rates, growth rates and any other factors 
which may affect future performance as known of in the current period.
The Group’s subsidiaries have prepared cash flow forecasts as part of the recent annual budgetary process, as approved by 
management. This provides the next three years’ cash flow forecasts which have been extrapolated forward at an estimated 
long‑term growth rate of 2.25%. To this has been applied the Group’s estimated weighted average cost of capital of 11%.
On the basis of these tests, no impairment of goodwill has arisen in the year ended 30 April 2009.
The other intangible assets also arise on the acquisition of the subsidiaries and are analysed above.
These intangible assets are in respect of acquired contracts of each of MASS and SEA and contracts to be secured in respect of MASS.
The other intangible assets are amortised over the expected lives of acquired contracts and contracts to be secured, as follows:

The contracts to be secured were in respect of certain overseas opportunities for which further consideration was payable if secured in 
accordance with the terms of the acquisition of MASS. This figure was reduced from the estimate of £500,000 at the date of acquisition 
to £280,000 following settlement of the MASS earn‑out on 5 June 2009.

provision in respect of other contract related provisions acquired with SEA.
The SEA earn‑out was earned in full and paid on 11 July 2008.
The MASS earn‑out is in respect of the obligation of the Group to settle deferred consideration payable to the vendors of MASS on 
receiving certain overseas contracts as set out in the sale and purchase agreement pertaining to the acquisition. On 5 June 2009, 
agreement was reached to pay the vendors of MASS £280,000 (after costs) in full settlement of the earn‑out. The earn‑out was 
paid on 11 June 2009.
The charge to the income statement in respect of AGS is the estimated cost to the Group of withdrawing from this joint 
venture investment.
The warranty provisions are management’s best estimates of the Group’s liability under warranties granted on software and other 
products supplied and is based upon past experience. The timing of such expenditure is uncertain although warranties have a time 
limit of no more than twelve months, unless a longer warranty period is purchased by the customer.
The other contract related provisions are management’s best estimate of the Group’s exposure to contract related costs 
and undertakings which are in addition to contract accruals. The timing of these is uncertain but expected to be resolved within 
twelve months of the balance sheet date. 41

Certain deferred tax assets and liabilities have been offset. The following is the analysis of the deferred tax balances (after offset) 
for financial reporting purposes:
      2009 2008 
      £’000 £’000
Asset      266 49
Liability      (920) (649)
      (654) (600)
At the balance sheet date the Group had unused trading tax losses within its subsidiaries of £1.7m (2008: losses of £1.8m) available 
for offset against future profits. No deferred tax asset has been recognised in respect of these losses due to the unpredictability 
of future taxable profit streams arising from the level of R&D credits. 
These tax losses can all be carried forward indefinitely.
The deferred tax liability in respect of the revaluation of freehold buildings arose on the acquisition of SEA and is the potential 
tax liability payable on the revaluation gain in respect of the building with reference to its historical cost.
The Company deferred tax balance at 30 April 2009 is £Nil (2008: £Nil). 42

Currency derivatives
The Group utilises forward currency contracts to hedge significant future transactions and cash flows. The Group is party to a number 
of foreign currency forward contracts in the management of its foreign exchange rate exposure.
At the balance sheet date, the total notional amount of outstanding foreign currency forward contracts that the Group was 
committed to were as follows:
      2009 2008 
      £’000 £’000
Contracts to sell euro and buy pounds sterling      3,493 2,228
At 30 April 2009, the fair value of the Group’s currency derivatives is estimated to be approximately £3,671,000 (2008: £2,359,000). 
These amounts are based on closing exchange rates.
£2,078,000 has been transferred to the income statement in respect of contracts that matured in the year.
£47,000 has been credited to the income statement in respect of marking the outstanding contracts at 30 April 2009 (2008: £131,000) 
to fair value with a corresponding adjustment to the derivative financial instrument recognised in the balance sheet as an asset 
of £178,000 at 30 April 2009 (2008: £131,000).
Interest rate swaps
The Group uses an interest rate swap to manage its exposure to interest rate movements on its mortgage borrowings.
A contract with nominal value of £612,000 has fixed interest payments at a rate of 7.38% for periods up until August 2016.
The fair value of the swap entered into at 30 April 2009 is estimated at £544,000 (2008: £626,000). These amounts are based 
on market values of equivalent instruments at 30 April 2009.
This interest rate swap is designated and effective as a cash flow hedge. The fair value (£68,000) has been recognised as a charge 
to equity with a corresponding credit to derivative financial instruments as recognised in the balance sheet at 30 April 2009 
(2008: £Nil).

26. Share‑based payments
The Group plan provides for a grant price equal to the average quoted market price of the Group shares on the date of grant. 
The vesting period is generally three years, five years in the case of some SA YE schemes. If options under the Cohort plc 2006 
Share option scheme remain unexercised after a period of ten years from the date of grant, the options expire. Furthermore, 
options are forfeited if the employee leaves the Group before the options vest.

The weighted average share price at the date of exercise for share options exercised during the year was £1.60 (2008: £1.61). 
The options outstanding at 30 April 2009 had a weighted average exercise price of £1.56 (2008: £1.40) and a weighted average 
remaining contractual life of six years (2008: five years).
In the year ended 30 April 2009, options were granted on 11 July 2008. The fair value of the options granted on that date was £1.89. 
In the year ended 30 April 2008, options were granted on 21 August 2007 and 4 February 2008. The aggregate of the estimated fair 
values of the options granted on those dates was £1.40.
The inputs into the Quoted Companies Alliance model, a Black Scholes based binominal model, are as follows:
     2009  2008

Leaver rate (per annum)     6.5%  6.5%
Dividend yield   0.26% – 0.33%  0.26%
Expected volatility was determined by calculating the historical volatility of the Group’s share price over the previous two years. 
The leaver rate used in the model has been adjusted, based on management’s best estimate, for the effects of non‑transferability, 
exercise restrictions and behavioural considerations.
The Group recognised a cost of £184,000 (2008: £129,000) relating to equity‑settled share‑based payment transactions, an equivalent 
amount being transferred to the share option reserve (see note 22).
27. Pension commitments
The Group makes contributions to defined contribution stakeholder pension schemes. The contributions for the year of £1,326,000 
(2008: £848,000) were charged to the income statement. Contributions outstanding at 30 April 2009 was £195,000. 46

Accounting Policies
Basis of accounting
The Group and Company financial statements have been prepared in accordance with applicable International Financial Reporting 
Standards (IFRS). The financial statements have also been prepared in accordance with IFRS as adopted by the European Union. 
The financial statements have been prepared on the historical cost basis, except for the revaluation of land and buildings and 
derivative financial instruments. The principal accounting policies are set out below.
The figures in the financial statements have been presented in thousands of pounds sterling except where otherwise indicated.
Basis of consolidation
The consolidated financial statements incorporate the financial statements of the Company and its subsidiary undertakings made 
up to 30 April 2009. Subsidiaries acquired during the year are consolidated from the date of acquisition, using the purchase method 
(see Business combinations below).
Where necessary, adjustments are made to the financial statements of subsidiaries to bring the accounting policies used into line 
with those used by the Group. This is necessary as the Group’s subsidiaries continue to prepare statutory financial statements 
in accordance with UK GAAP . 
All intra‑group transactions, balances, income and expenses are eliminated on consolidation.
The results, assets and liabilities of the joint venture of the Group have been incorporated in these financial statements using 
the equity method of accounting.
Advanced Geospatial Solutions Limited (AGS) has been accounted for as a joint venture for the entire year.
The Company has not presented its own profit and loss account, as permitted by Section 408 of the Companies Act 2006. 
The profit in the income statement of the Company is disclosed in the Directors’ report.
Business combinations
The acquisition of subsidiaries is accounted for using the purchase method. The cost of the acquisition is measured as the 
aggregate of the fair values, at the completion date, of assets acquired, liabilities incurred or assumed and equity instruments 
issued by the Group in exchange for control of the acquiree, plus any costs directly attributable to the business combination.
Goodwill arising on acquisition is recognised as an asset and initially measured at cost, being the excess of the cost of the business 
combination over the Group’s interest in the net fair value of the identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities recognised. 
If, after reassessment, which is a point in time greater than twelve months after the completion date, the Group’s interest in the 
net fair value of the acquiree’s identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities exceeds or is below the cost of the business 
combination, the excess or shortfall is recognised immediately in the income statement.
Adjustments to the provisional value of assets and liabilities acquired in a business combination when the final values have become 
known within twelve months are adjusted as if the accounting had been completed at the acquisition date and the comparative 
information for prior periods is restated accordingly.
Any change in consideration, where previously estimated, is recognised as an adjustment to goodwill.
Goodwill
Goodwill arising on consolidation represents the excess of the cost of acquisition over the Group’s interest in the fair value of the 
identifiable assets and liabilities of a subsidiary, associate or jointly controlled entity at the date of acquisition. Goodwill is initially 
recognised as an asset at cost and is subsequently measured at cost less any accumulated impairment losses. Goodwill which is 
recognised as an asset is reviewed for impairment at least annually. Any impairment is recognised immediately in the income 
statement and is not subsequently reversed.
For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill is allocated to each of the Group’s subsidiaries as appropriate. Subsidiaries 
(cash generating units) to which goodwill has been allocated are tested for impairment annually, or more frequently when there 
is an indication that the unit may be impaired. If the recoverable amount of the subsidiary is less than the carrying amount of the 
subsidiary, the impairment loss is allocated first to reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill allocated to the subsidiary and then 
to the other assets of the subsidiary pro rata on the basis of the carrying amount of each asset in the subsidiary. An impairment loss 
recognised for goodwill is not reversed in a subsequent period. 
On disposal of a subsidiary, associate or jointly controlled entity, the attributable amount of goodwill is included in the determination 
of the profit or loss on disposal. 
Revenue recognition
Revenue is recognised at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable for the provision of goods and services, excluding 
discounts, VAT and other sales related taxes. 
Sales of goods are recognised when goods are delivered and title has passed.
Revenue from contracts is recognised as the activity progresses to reflect the partial performance of contractual obligations. 
In the case of long‑term contracts, revenue is recognised appropriate to the stage of completion when the outcome of the contract 
can be assessed with reasonable certainty.
Leasing
Leases are classified as finance leases whenever the terms of the lease transfer substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership 
to the lessee. All other leases are classified as operating leases. 48
Cohort plc Annual Report and Accounts 2009
Accounting Policies continued
The Group as lessee
Assets held under finance leases are recognised as assets of the Group at their fair value or , if lower, at the present value of the 
minimum lease payments, each determined at the inception of the lease. The corresponding liability to the lessor is included in 
the balance sheet as a finance lease obligation. Lease payments are apportioned between finance charges and reduction of the 
lease obligation so as to achieve a constant rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability. 
Rentals payable under operating leases are charged to income on a straight‑line basis over the term of the relevant lease.
Benefits received and receivable as an incentive to enter into an operating lease are also spread on a straight‑line basis over 
the lease term.
Foreign currencies
The individual financial statements of each Group company are presented in the currency of the primary economic environment 
in which it operates (its functional currency), which is currently sterling for the whole Group. For the purpose of the consolidated 
financial statements, the results and financial position of each Group company are expressed in pounds sterling, which is the functional 
currency of the Company, and the presentation currency for the consolidated financial statements. 
In preparing the financial statements of the individual companies, transactions in currencies other than the entity’s functional 
currency (foreign currencies) are recorded at the rates of exchange prevailing on the dates of the transactions. At each balance 
sheet date, monetary assets and liabilities that are denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at the rates prevailing on 
the balance sheet date. Non‑monetary items carried at fair value that are denominated in foreign currencies are translated at the 
rates prevailing at the date when the fair value was determined. Non‑monetary items that are measured in terms of historical 
costs in a foreign currency are not retranslated. 
Exchange differences arising on the settlement of monetary items, and on the retranslation of monetary items, are included in the 
income statement for the year. Exchange differences arising on the retranslation of non‑monetary items carried at fair value are 
included in the income statement for the year except for differences arising on the retranslation of non‑monetary items in respect 
of which gains and losses are recognised directly in equity. For such non‑monetary items, any exchange component of that gain or 
loss is also recognised directly in equity. 
In order to hedge its exposure to certain foreign exchange risks, the Group enters into forward contracts (see below for details 
of the Group’s Accounting Policies in respect of such derivative financial instruments).
Borrowing costs
All other borrowing costs are recognised in the income statement in the period in which they are incurred.
Taxation
The tax expense represents the sum of the tax currently payable and the deferred tax expense or credit.
The tax currently payable is based on taxable profit for the year . Taxable profit differs from net profit as reported in the income 
statement because it excludes items of income or expense that are taxable or deductible in other years and it further excludes 
items that are never taxable or deductible. The Group’s liability for current tax is calculated using tax rates that have been 
enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date. 
Deferred tax is the tax expected to be payable or recoverable on differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities 
in the financial statements and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable profit, and is accounted for using 
the balance sheet liability method. Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised for all taxable temporary differences and 
deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available against which deductible 
temporary differences can be utilised. Such assets and liabilities are not recognised if the temporary difference arises from the 
initial recognition of goodwill or from the initial recognition (other than in a business combination) of other assets and liabilities 
in a transaction that affects neither the tax profit nor the accounting profit.
Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for taxable temporary differences arising on investments in subsidiaries and associates, 
and interest in joint ventures, except where the Group is able to control the reversal of the temporary difference and it is probable 
that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each balance sheet date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer 
probable that sufficient taxable profits will be available to allow all or part of the asset to be recovered.
Deferred tax is calculated at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period when the liability is settled or the asset is realised. 
Deferred tax is charged or credited to the income statement, except when it relates to items charged or credited directly to equity, 
in which case the deferred tax is also dealt with in equity.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to set off current tax assets against current 
tax liabilities and when they relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority and the Group intends to settle its current 
tax assets and liabilities on a net basis. 
Pension contributions
Payments are made to the Company’s stakeholder pension schemes, all defined contribution schemes. Amounts are charged 
to the income statement as incurred. 49
Cohort plc Annual Report and Accounts 2009
Property, plant and equipment
Land and buildings held for use in the production or supply of goods or services, or for administrative purposes, are stated 
in the balance sheet at their fair value at the date of acquisition, plus any subsequent cost, less any subsequent accumulated 
depreciation and subsequent accumulated impairment losses. 
Fixtures and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and any recognised impairment loss.
Depreciation is charged so as to write off the cost or valuation of assets, other than land and properties under construction, 
over their estimated useful lives, using the straight line method, on the following bases:
Buildings    2% 
Fixtures, fittings and equipment 20% – 50%
Assets held under finance leases are depreciated over their expected useful lives on the same basis as owned assets or , 
where shorter, over the term of the relevant lease.
The gain or loss arising on the disposal or retirement of an asset is determined as the difference between the sales proceeds 
and the carrying amount of the asset and is recognised in the income statement as an exceptional item. 
Research and development expenditure
Expenditure on research activities is recognised as an expense in the period in which it is incurred.
An internally‑generated intangible asset arising from the Group’s own development activity is recognised only if all of the following 
conditions are met:
I  an asset is created that can be identified (such as software and new processes) and is technically and commercially feasible; 
I  it is probable that the asset created will generate future economic benefits and the Group has available to itself sufficient 
resources to complete the development and to subsequently sell and/or use the asset created; and
I  the development cost of the asset can be measured reliably.
Internally‑generated intangible assets are amortised on a straight‑line basis over their useful lives. Where no internally‑generated 
intangible asset can be recognised, development expenditure is recognised as an expense in the period in which it is incurred. 
Intangible assets
Intangible assets are recognised in respect of contracts, customer relationships and other measurable intangibles arising on business 
combinations. The value of these intangible assets is determined by the estimated value to the Group going forward and the intangible 
assets are written off on a straight line basis over the estimated useful life.
Impairment of tangible and intangible assets excluding goodwill
At each balance sheet date, the Group reviews the carrying amounts of its tangible and intangible assets to determine whether 
there is any indication that those assets have suffered an impairment loss. If any such indication exists, the recoverable amount 
of the asset is estimated in order to determine the extent of the impairment (if any). An intangible asset with an indefinite useful 
life is tested for impairment annually and whenever there is an indication that the asset may be impaired.
Recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs to sell and value in use. In assessing value in use, the estimated future 
cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre‑tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time 
value of money and the risks specific to the asset for which the estimates of future cash flows have not been adjusted.
If the recoverable amount of an asset (or subsidiary) is estimated to be less than its carrying amount, the carrying amount of the 
asset (subsidiary) is reduced to its recoverable amount. An impairment loss is recognised as an expense immediately, unless the 
relevant asset is carried at a revalued amount, in which case the impairment loss is treated as a revaluation decrease. 
Where an impairment loss subsequently reverses, the carrying amount of the asset (subsidiary) is increased to the revised estimate 
of its recoverable amount, but so that the increased carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been 
determined had no impairment loss been recognised for the asset (subsidiary) in prior years. A reversal of an impairment loss is 
recognised as income immediately, unless the relevant asset is carried at a revalued amount, in which case the reversal of the 
impairment loss is treated as a revaluation increase.
Share‑based payments
The Group has applied the requirements of IFRS 2 ‘Share‑based payments’. In accordance with the transitional provisions, IFRS 2 
has been applied to all grants of equity instruments after 7 November 2002 that were unvested as of 1 May 2006.
The Group issues equity‑settled and cash‑settled share‑based payments to certain employees. Equity‑settled share‑based payments 
are measured at fair value (excluding the effect of non market‑based vesting conditions) at the date of grant. The fair value determined 
at the grant date of equity‑settled share‑based payments is expensed on a straight‑line basis over the vesting period based on the 
Group’s estimate of shares that will eventually vest and adjusted for the non market‑based vesting conditions.
Fair value is measured by use of the Quoted Companies Alliance binomial model. The expected life used in the models 
has been adjusted, based on management’s best estimate, for the effect of non‑transferability, exercise restrictions 
and behavioural considerations. 50
Cohort plc Annual Report and Accounts 2009
Accounting Policies continued
Share‑based payments continued
A liability equal to the portion of the goods and services received is recognised at the current fair value determined at each 
balance sheet date for cash‑settled, share‑based payments.
The cost of share‑based payments is charged to the income statement with a corresponding credit applied to the share option reserve. 
The appropriate element of the reserve is transferred to the retained profit of the Group when the share options to which the 
reserve relate vest.
Exceptional items
Cohort’s trade is the provision of technical advice and support, and the design, development and manufacture of niche products. 
As part of its operations, the Group may dispose of or recognise impairment of subsidiaries, associates (including joint ventures 
and investments) and fixed assets as well as other significant non‑trading transactions, either as part of continuing operations 
or discontinued operations.
These items form part of the Group’s operating activities and are reported in arriving at the Group’s profit from operations, 
however, management does not consider these items to be part of trading activities. The gains or losses on such items can 
be significant and arise in different reporting periods and would consequently have a material impact upon the absolute amount 
of and trend in the Group’s trading profit from operations.
Any gains or losses (including transaction costs) on these non‑trading items are disclosed as a separate line item (in aggregate) 
in the income statement with analysis in a note to the accounts.
Significant	estimates	and	judgements
The preparation of the financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgements that affect the reported 
amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses, some of which are difficult, complex, or subjective. For this reason actual 
results could differ from estimates and this might have a material impact on our results.
Management have identified the following areas where critical assumptions or estimates are made:
Revenue and profit recognition from long‑term contracts
The Group applies a consistent process to accounting for revenue and profit recognition on long‑term contracts. In making these 
estimates and judgements, management rely on underlying processes and procedures and makes use of internal and external 
expert resource in arriving at the final accounting estimate or judgement. These balances are regularly reviewed to ensure the 
value is appropriate.
Acquisition intangibles
Intangibles other than goodwill that are obtained through acquisition are capitalised on the balance sheet. These intangibles are 
valued on acquisition using a discounted cash flow methodology which depends on future assumptions about the revenue from 
contracts, prices and costs and on the Group’s cost of capital. These assumptions reflect management’s best estimates but depend 
on inherent uncertainties which may not be within the control of management.
Recoverability of goodwill
We have significant goodwill balances the life of which we consider to be indefinite. We assess annually the recoverability of the 
balance, or more frequently in the event of an occurrence indicating impairment. The assessment involves comparing the carrying 
amount of the asset with its recoverable amount, which is typically its value in use. Value in use is determined using discounted cash 
flow techniques that involve the estimation of future cash flows over a long period and an appropriate discount rate to apply.
Future cash flows are estimated based on historical experience, internal estimates and data from external sources. Such estimates are 
subject to change as a result of changes in economic and competitive conditions. Higher estimates of future cash flows will increases 
the value in use of goodwill, but lower estimates of cash flows will reduce the value in use and increase the risk of impairment.
Discount rates are applied to the cash flows to arrive at the value in use. An increase in the discount rate will reduce the value in use 
of the goodwill, and therefore increases the risk of the value in use falling below the carrying value and resulting in the requirement 
for an impairment provision. A reduction in the discount rate decreases the likelihood of an impairment.
Future changes in interest rates, the premium that markets place on equity investments relative to risk free rates and the specific 
assessment of the capital markets as to our risk relative to other companies can affect our discount rate. Increases in interest rates 
or the risk premiums applied by capital markets would result in an increase in our discount rate and vice versa. These factors are 
largely outside our control or ability to predict and can therefore have a significant impact on the estimated fair value of goodwill.
Inventories
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Cost of finished goods and work in progress includes overheads 
appropriate to the stage of manufacture. Net realisable value is based upon estimated selling price less further cost expected to 
be incurred to completion and disposal. Provision is made for obsolete and slow‑moving items.
Long‑term contracts are assessed on a contract by contract basis and reflected in the profit and loss account by recording revenue 
and related costs as contract activity progresses. Revenue is ascertained in a manner appropriate to the stage of completion of the 
contract, and credit taken for profit earned to date when the outcome of the contract can be assessed with reasonable certainty . 
The amount by which revenue exceeds payments on account is classified as “amounts recoverable on contracts” and included within 
trade and other receivables; to the extent that payments on account exceed relevant revenue, the excess is included as an advance 
receipt within trade and other payables. The amount of long‑term contracts, at cost net of amounts transferred to cost of sales, 
less provision for foreseeable losses and payments on account not matched with revenue, is included within inventories, as work 
in progress. 51
Cohort plc Annual Report and Accounts 2009
Provisions
Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present obligation as a result of a past event, and it is probable that the Group will 
be required to settle that obligation. Provisions are measured at the Directors’ best estimate of the expenditure required to settle 
the obligation at the balance sheet date, and are discounted to present value where the effect is material. 
Financial instruments
Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognised in the Group’s balance sheet when the Group becomes a party to the contractual 
provisions of the instrument.
Trade receivables
Trade receivables are measured at initial recognition at fair value. Appropriate allowances for estimated irrecoverable amounts 
are recognised in the income statement when there is objective evidence that the asset is impaired. The allowance recognised 
is measured as the difference between the asset’s carrying amount and the estimated recoverable amount. 
Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash on hand and on‑demand deposits, and other short‑term highly liquid investments that are 
readily convertible to a known amount of cash and are subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value. Deposits included within 
cash and cash equivalents have less than three months to maturity.
Financial liabilities and equity
Financial liabilities and equity instruments are classified according to the substance of the contractual arrangements entered into. 
An equity instrument is any contract that evidences a residual interest in the assets of the Group after deducting all of its liabilities. 
Bank borrowings
Interest‑bearing bank loans and overdrafts are recorded at the proceeds received, net of direct issue costs. Finance charges, 
including premiums payable on settlement or redemption and direct issue costs, are accounted for on an accrual basis in the 
income statement using the effective interest rate method and are disclosed within accruals to the extent they are not settled 
in the period, unless the loan terms provide for the interest to be added to the principal, in which case the interest is added 
to the carrying amount of the instrument to which it pertains.
Trade payables
Trade payables are initially measured at fair value. 
Equity instruments
Equity instruments issued by the Company are recorded at the proceeds received, net of direct issue costs.
Derivative	financial	instruments	and	hedge	accounting
The Group’s activities expose it to the financial risks of changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates. The Group 
uses foreign exchange forward contracts and interest rate swap contracts to hedge these exposures. The Group does not use 
derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes.
Changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments that are designated and effective as hedges of future cash flows are 
recognised directly in equity and the ineffective portion is recognised immediately in the income statement. If the cash flow hedge 
of a firm commitment or forecasted transaction results in the recognition of an asset or a liability, then, at the time the asset or 
liability is recognised, the associated gains or losses on the derivative that had previously been recognised in equity are included 
in the initial measurement of the asset or liability. For hedges that do not result in the recognition of an asset or a liability, amounts 
deferred in equity are recognised in the income statement in the same period in which the hedged item affects net income.
Changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments that do not qualify for hedge accounting are recognised in the income 
statement as they arise.
Joint ventures
The Group accounts for joint ventures where it has a participating interest using the equity method of accounting and discloses 
the net investment in non‑current assets.
Where the investment in a joint venture is negative, the negative investment, to the extent it is a liability of the Group is offset 
against any trade and other receivables held by the Group in respect of that joint venture.
The Group does not account for joint ventures in which it no longer has a participating interest. 52

Standards	and	interpretations	issued	at	30	 April	2009	not	applied	to	these	financial	statements
The following changes and amendments to IFRS that have not been reflected in these financial statements and are likely to have 
an impact on the Group in the future.

  This will require more disclosure.
The above standards will apply to the Group’s interim statement for six months ended 31 October 2009 to be published in December 2009.
A number of other standard amendments and IFRICs (International Financial Reporting Interpretation Committee) have been issued 
and are yet to be applied by the Group. In most cases these are unlikely to be applicable including IAS 20 (Accounting for Government 
Grants and Disclosures of Government Assistance), IAS 38 (Intangible Assets – promotional activities) and IAS 40 (Investment Property). 
IFRS 3 Business Combinations (revised) will first apply for the year ended 30 April 2011 and the impact of this will be referred to in

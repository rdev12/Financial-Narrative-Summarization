Review
The Board
Three Directors joined the Board in 201 1. 
Kevin Dolan brings his extensive 
international experience gathered over the 
past 32 years from his executive and 
non-executive roles in financial services. 
Two of our executives also joined the Board: 
James Darkins, Managing Director of 
Property, and David Jacob, Managing 
Director of Henderson Investment 
Management and Chief Investment Officer. 
They have been with the Group for 14 and 
seven years respectively. Gerry Aherne, who 
has been a Director for over seven years 
and Chairman of the Remuneration 
Committee since 2005, will stand down  
as a Director at the 2012 AGM. I would like 
to thank him for the advice and experience 
he brought to Henderson Group and wish 
him every success for the future.
Outlook
It is hard to see a speedy conclusion to the 
eurozone debt crisis. It is easy to see that 
the financial services industry will continue 
to experience political and regulatory 
uncertainty. As a result, we expect markets 
to remain volatile. However, we are well 
placed to manage the business through 
choppy waters, by concentrating on those 
areas we can control. We will continue to 
watch our costs carefully, but we will retain 
the flexibility to invest to protect and expand 
the business. We will focus on investment 
performance and building our distribution 
network. Finally, we will continue to offer a 
portfolio of attractive products that meet or 
exceed the expectations of our clients.
These are challenging times, but the Board, 
the management team and staff are 
determined to ensure Henderson thrives for 
the long-term benefit of our shareholders.
Thank you
The Board would like to thank our staff for 
all they have done in a difficult year, through 
their enthusiasm, dedication and hard work. 
We also thank our shareholders for your 
continued support.
Rupert Pennant-Rea
Chairman 
Overview
201 1 was an important year in the history  
of Henderson. The business rose to some 
significant challenges, ranging from a 
transformational acquisition to further 
economic turmoil. 
An optimistic start to 201 1, with improving 
economic data and confidence levels, was 
soon overshadowed by the devastating 
Japanese earthquake in March. Then came 
softer economic data from the US, and  
the sovereign debt crisis in the eurozone. 
Understandably, investors turned cautious, 
and most equity markets ended the year down.
Despite this, Henderson delivered a good 
result. The Group’s underlying profit was up 
58%, primarily as a result of the Gartmore 
acquisition and helped by continuing cost 
control. We start 2012 in a good position  
to achieve long-term value for our 
shareholders.
Corporate activity
Our acquisition of Gartmore, a UK-based 
fund manager, showed Henderson at its 
best: the strategic rationale was 
overwhelming, the business was a great fit 
and we bought it at a price that was highly 
attractive for our shareholders. The 
subsequent integration has gone well: we 
have beaten our targets in terms of both 
assets and clients retained, and completed 
the integration ahead of schedule.
As a result of this acquisition we have 
strengthened two areas of strategic 
importance to us, in retail and absolute 
return. We also added to our core 
investment capabilities, especially in Global 
and Emerging Market Equities, and we have 
expanded our distribution reach, above all in 
Japan. The lessons we learned from buying 
New Star in 2009 have played a big part in 
ensuring that we extract value for our 
shareholders from Gartmore, which has 
helped improve our diluted underlying 
earnings per share by more than 30%. 
In line with our strategic objectives, we  
also sold a number of non-core businesses 
last year. These include the transfer of  
our liquidity fund, the sale of New Star 
Institutional Managers Limited (NSIM) and, 
just recently, the disposal of our interest in 
Hermes GPE LLP, a private equity fund of 
funds joint venture.
Dividends
The Board is recommending a final dividend 
for 201 1 of 5.05 pence per share, bringing 
the total dividend to 7.0 pence per share, 
8% higher than the 2010 total. The final 
dividend will be paid on 25 May 2012 to 
shareholders who are on the share register 
on 4 May 2012. We will continue to apply 
our formula so that the next interim dividend 
will be 30% of the total dividend for the 
previous year – subject, of course, to the 
sensible caveat that we must have the 
resources to make the payment.
Chairman’s Statement
The business is stronger.  
Now we want growth – 
sustainable, organic growth

Review of 2011
In any normal period, 201 1 would have felt 
like an extraordinary year. However, in these 
times, it is more like the norm. After an 
optimistic start, sentiment turned negative 
in August weighed down by the debate 
over Chinese economic prospects, the 
continuing eurozone sovereign debt crisis 
and slowing global growth. Emerging 
markets such as Brazil, India and China, 
which had performed well in 2010, retreated 
in 201 1 as concerns of higher inflation and 
weaker global demand increased and as 
investors’ risk appetites waned.
Notwithstanding these events, the Group 
delivered a strong financial result in 201 1 with 
underlying profit up 58%. We also made good 
progress in our key strategic objectives, 
including growing our retail and absolute 
return businesses, and I would like to thank  
all staff for their continued dedication. The 
Chairman has highlighted the success of  
the Gartmore acquisition and I echo his 
Strong profit growth and 
continued margin 
improvements
Good progress towards 
achieving strategic 
objectives
Gartmore acquisition 
exceeds expectations and 
strengthens our business
comments. Gartmore wasn’t the only 
corporate activity we focused on. With clear 
sight on our central business priorities, we 
exited a number of non-core businesses 
which has improved efficiency in the business.
In 2012, we will continue to focus on 
progressing towards our strategic objectives. 
The Gartmore and New Star acquisitions 
have provided a solid base from which to 
grow our UK retail business. Our SICAV 
fund range is strongly positioned for when 
investor demand returns and in our US 
retail fund range, we plan to develop 
more investment propositions.
We are well placed to further grow our 
absolute return fund range and we are 
bringing in new talent to develop our 
global product.
By staying close to our clients and partners, 
whilst focusing on efficiency in the business, 
we are confident that we can continue to 
grow profitably.
After a positive start,  
political and economic  
events resulted in increased  
market volatility and  
lower market levels

Changes in the political landscape
One of the most noticeable developments in 
201 1 was the increasing influence of 
political events on capital market behaviour. 
This different dimension generated further 
volatility and uncertainty. The political 
impasse in many developed nations and 
resultant lack of clarity was most notable  
in the eurozone and questions remain over 
the sustainability of the euro. These political 
ramifications have a disproportionate 
influence over the investment universe, 
making the challenge for investment 
managers even greater. Similarly, the 
political upheavals seen in the Middle East 
coupled with a number of elections and 
leadership changes due to take place will 
add to uncertainty and volatility, at least in 
the near term. 
That said, company valuations on many 
measures sit at undemanding levels and 
earnings growth is gathering pace. We 
expect to see company valuations to be less 
correlated to the risks associated with 
country specific economies and therefore 
could perform better despite these 
economic headwinds.
Outlook for equities
The balance of economic data seen more 
recently already seems to show that the 
eurozone is in recession and is likely to stay 
there through the first quarter of 2012. 
However, we see this as an opportunity. 
Whilst European equities may have further 
short-term downside, they are already 
trading at compelling values. Investors  
need courage in these markets but  
this is precisely the time to seize  
long-term opportunities. 
The US is more finely balanced and has a 
good chance of avoiding recession, although 
it remains vulnerable to global events such 
as those unfolding across Europe. In the US, 
equities are the asset class that has most 
discounted a weak outlook and therefore 
offer the most upside potential, especially  
as investors have largely been sellers of  
US equities for the last 10 years. 
Over the last decade, the Western world 
spent more than it saved, but Asia did the 
opposite. In the coming year, we hope to  
see the beginnings of a reversal of this cycle 
as consumption levels rise in Asia with 
governments more focused on domestic 
demand rather than exports which, given  
the deterioration in global growth, are likely 
to decline. 
Outlook for fixed income
Inflation and interest rates are unlikely to be 
a major threat for fixed income markets in 
developed countries in 2012. The key 
concern will be the impact of across-the-
board deleveraging. Governments are 
embarking on austerity measures when 
households and the banking sector are also 
deleveraging. This could hamper economic 
growth and worsen debt-to-GDP ratios. 
Although European politicians finally seem 
to understand the gravity of the situation, 
they need to promote growth if they are to 
avoid further setbacks and potentially 
defaults amongst a number of smaller 
eurozone countries. The disruption in the 
sovereign debt markets fed into corporate 
bond spreads causing them to widen by year 
end, arguably pricing the default rates higher 
than balance sheet health warrants.
For the coming year, continued volatility  
will present opportunities to satisfy various 
risk appetites. 10

Expand absolute return 
product range: 
Henderson and Gartmore 
combined strength
With the acquisition of Gartmore, we have 
significantly strengthened our absolute 
return capability. By combining the two 
fund ranges and launching new absolute 
products, we have seen increased client 
interest and sales. We have been 
successfully managing hedge funds for 
over 10 years and we are widely 
recognised as one of the leading absolute 
return fund firms in Europe. Today, we 
manage approximately £4.6bn of assets 
across the fund range. 
We offer clients an award winning range of 
equity long/short, macro and credit 
strategies within a rigorous institutional 
framework. 
We continue to work closely with our 
clients on existing products and 
developing new products with the aim of 
delivering strong, risk adjusted returns. 
Given our experience, diverse fund range 
and investment expertise, we are well 
placed to participate in the growth of the 
absolute return sector. Both retail and 
institutional investors are expected to 
increase their allocations significantly in 
the absolute return space.
Our distribution team will specifically be 
looking at ways to grow our market share 
in Continental Europe, the US, Asia and 
Japan.
Outlook for property
The UK commercial property market 
showed considerable resilience in 201 1.  
We consider 2012 will be more about 
income and quality than capital return. 
Although the market has lowered its return 
expectations for 2012, demand for the asset 
class remains healthy, given the compelling 
yield profile of commercial property. In 
Europe, investor focus is on liquid markets  
in the strongest economies, most notably  
in Germany. Investors are preferring retail 
property, due to the defensive quality of that 
sector, and investors are targeting Germany 
in search of safe cash flow. However, it is 
likely that Europe’s best performing region 
will continue to be the Nordics and investors 
in Sweden stand to benefit from 
comparatively strong growth expectations 
and perceived safety in northern Europe. 
More opportunistic investors should target 
Spain and Italy, countries most likely to 
survive a potential restructuring of the 
eurozone. In Asia, we expect investment 
activities are likely to be driven by both 
Western and Asian institutional capital 
seeking safe havens and in the US, the 
multi-family sector continues to offer the 
best return outlook.
Regulatory outlook
Around the world, regulatory bodies are 
working through an unprecedented number 
of initiatives to shore up the infrastructure, 
transparency, competence and reputation  
of the financial services industry. In the UK, 
the primary focus remains on protecting 
consumers’ best interests by introducing 
regulation such as the retail distribution 
review, new safeguards for client assets and 
increased governance requirements around 
the life cycle for retail products.
European regulators are concentrating on 
directives aiming to increase market 
transparency, reduce systemic market risk 
and boost consumer protection. The new 
requirements for alternative products are 
still under development. 
US regulations such as Dodd-Frank and the 
Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act will also 
bring a number of new obligations for which 
significant preparation will be necessary. 
We believe our business is in good shape  
to meet these challenges through 2012  
and beyond.
Case study
The outlook for the Group
Despite this ongoing market volatility, I 
remain confident about the outlook for 
Henderson. The New Star and Gartmore 
acquisitions have strengthened our 
presence in a number of core areas, notably 
in the UK retail market and absolute return. 
By investing in other areas of our business 
to enhance or add capabilities, together with 
our ongoing efficiency programme and 
variable cost base, we are in a good position 
to deliver value for our shareholders.
Our collaborative way of working ensures 
that we are always focused on producing the 
best product and best service for our clients.

Business Review
The acquisition of Gartmore cements our 
position as a UK retail fund manager where 
we are now ranked sixth by AUM. 
Financially, the acquisition has already 
delivered and we are starting to see the 
strategic benefits flow through. We have 
enhanced our product range, in particular, 
our absolute return product offering, and we 
are beginning to fill gaps in two priority 
areas – Global Equities and Emerging 
Markets Equities. We also extended our 
distribution network into areas such as 
Japan and further enhanced our global 
hedge distribution capability. The integration 
of funds and people was seamless and, from 
a client perspective, it was business as usual 
in record time.
Following the successful integration of 
Gartmore we reviewed our business 
structure to ensure that we allocate 
resources to those capabilities we anticipate 
clients will demand. While Gartmore added 
or enhanced capabilities that we wish to 
grow, we sold non-core businesses such as 
Henderson Liquid Assets Fund (HLAF) and 
NSIM, and closed other funds or adjusted 
the way in which some are managed. For 
example, we closed our global currency fund 
and we have partnered with EIRIS, a leading 
provider of independent research into the 
environmental, social, governance and 
ethical performance of companies, to 
provide detailed research and analysis to 
support our SRI capability. We are focused 
on delivering core product to our clients 
which will entail some new product launches 
and at the same time, we will continue to 
rationalise our product range in order to 
provide additional clarity to clients regarding 
our offerings (refer to page 16 case study 
for more details). 
Investment performance in most of our 
funds across asset class and product type 
continued to be good with performance in 
our fixed income products in particular 
remaining strong over one and three years. 
Our equity funds’ three year performance 
remains good, although one year 
performance suffered somewhat as some  
of our larger funds underperformed (for 
more details on investment performance 
refer to page 15). 
Our core distribution markets are in the  
UK and Continental Europe and we are 
increasing our presence in the US and Asia. 
In the UK, we have seen an improvement in 
our brand awareness following our 
successful completion of two acquisitions in 
the past three years. In addition, we 
launched a bold advertising campaign (see 
the panel on the right-hand side for more 
details) which has shown some impressive 
results over a short time frame. We held our 
third successful investment conference for 
UK financial advisers and recently launched 
HGi, which is both an online and print 
platform designed to bring together the 
views and commentary of our experts and 
deliver them to our clients, helping them to 
follow the fund managers, topics and funds 
that are most relevant. 
We had positive net flows in a broad range 
of funds including UK retail absolute return, 
Strategic and Corporate Bond funds, Long 
Dated Credit, Multi-Manager and Cautiously 
Managed funds. We continue to see good 
demand for our fixed income funds with 
three of our funds topping £1bn in assets. 
Anticipated market volatility in 2012 is likely 
to make investor demand difficult to predict, 
but we think that both fixed income and 
absolute return funds will remain in demand. 
Investment trusts remain a sizeable and 
important part of our business and we are 
especially pleased with being named Best 
Investment Trust Provider 201 1 by 
Investment Life & Pensions Moneyfacts.
With the continued eurozone turbulence and 
falling investor confidence, it is not surprising 
that flows in our pan-European equity funds 
were volatile and overall disappointing in 201 1. 
However, given our good investment 
performance, the strength and the quality of 
our team, we have a strong proposition and we 
are confident that we are well placed for when 
investor demand returns. 
We have established a new relationship with 
Manulife Asset Management in Taiwan to help

Grow retail  
business:
José Mourinho 
advertising campaign
By teaming up with José Mourinho, the 
most successful and charismatic football 
manager of his generation in a bold 
advertising campaign, we embarked on an 
exciting journey to position Henderson as 
a ‘go to’ fund manager. 
The campaign launched in the UK, 
countries across Continental Europe and 
Asia in October 201 1. It was, however,  
less about football and more about the 
attributes and attitude that a manager 
needs to satisfy its clients. It plays on the 
analogy between football management 
and fund management, recognising that 
qualities such as passion for the subject, 
research and planning skills, risk 
assessment, quality of decision making 
and motivating talented people to work 
together in teams are common to both 
disciplines. 
José, whilst sometimes controversial, 
embodies these qualities in a highly 
passionate way with charm and a sense  
of humour. Just as José readily describes 
himself as the ‘special one’ for football 
management, we want Henderson to be 
seen as special in asset management and 
amongst our clients, wherever they may be.

institutional business and we plan to develop 
further products for that market.
Our absolute return business performed  
well in the year with positive net flows into 
liquidity, agriculture and a number of our 
AlphaGen funds (previously Gartmore 
funds). We are particularly encouraged by 
the flows in the AlphaGen funds which 
resumed shortly after we completed the 
Gartmore acquisition. The asset weighted 
performance of our absolute return funds 
compares favourably to industry experience 
and our proven long-term track record of 
delivering strong, risk-adjusted investment 
performance across a range of established 
absolute return strategies continues to drive 
investor interest. We expect to strengthen 
the absolute return product offering as 
evidenced by the launch of two liquidity 
strategies and the recent take-on of a team 
focused on agriculture. 
Our UK fixed income business remains 
strong in the institutional marketplace. We 
value the importance of our relationships with 
institutional clients and consultants in all 
geographies and have worked hard to 
strengthen these ties. As a result, we hope  
to continue sourcing new business from 
existing regions and also expand distribution 
of our capabilities into the Nordics, South 
America, Japan and China.
Despite ongoing challenges in the economic 
environment in 201 1, we continued to see 
consistent levels of activity in our Property 
business. Throughout the year, we 
successfully marketed four new funds,  
were involved in over 90 asset deals and 
saw a supply of new equity from existing  
and new clients.
Property AUM grew by £598m from 
£1 1.8bn to £12.4bn due to favourable 
market and foreign exchange rate 
movements of £310m and net flows of 
£270m. We completed first closings for the 
Henderson CASA V Fund, another in the 
series of our North American multi-family 
funds, Warburg-Henderson Austria No. 2 
and Warburg-Henderson Koop Fund, a 
pan-European specialist fund. We also 
completed first and second closings for the 
Henderson German Retail Income Fund and 
won mandates for segregated clients 
totalling £152m.
Total uninvested client commitments at  
31 December 201 1 were £1.4bn (2010: 
£1.4bn), with £776m investments made, 
offset by £892m new equity and debt. We 
plan to deploy this equity in the US and 
Europe for selective purchases over the next 
few years. We invested in our distribution 
team to support future growth in these  
two markets where we are already well 
established and also newer markets, where 
we see strong potential. We plan to grow our 
existing sovereign wealth network, expand 
into new geographies and explore 
opportunities within the private wealth sector. 
Most of the funds we launched followed our 
historical ‘pooled fund’ route, however the 
structure of the Warburg-Henderson Koop 
Fund represents a ‘club’ mandate for four 
pension funds. Increasingly, institutional 
clients are looking for more bespoke fund 
and investment solutions. By joining club 
deals such as these, it allows investors with 
similar investment and distribution strategies 
to group their equity together whilst also 
receiving individual client service and 
manager expertise. It is a route we plan to 
focus on more in the future. 
We selectively invested in high quality, 
defensive assets with strong cash flows. We 
took advantage of a range of opportunities 
through our European infrastructure and 
anniversary of our Hong Kong business in 
2012 and will support this with a marketing 
and advertising campaign as well as a number 
of client events.
Demand for our US retail funds was 
adversely impacted as US investors shunned 
European and international equities. 
However, we continue to build our US retail 
business and in 201 1 we celebrated the 10 
year anniversary of our flagship fund, 
International Opportunities. Our second 
largest US mutual fund, Global Equity 
Income, is top quartile over five years

Warburg-Henderson
In 201 1, we celebrated 10 years of 
successful partnership with M.M. Warburg 
& Co, a German private bank. 
We founded our joint venture in order to 
access the German institutional market. 
The partnership provides local institutional 
investors with the best of both worlds: our 
European network, international asset 
management expertise and rigorous, 
research driven investment process, 
combined with Warburg’s experience in 
setting up and managing a regulated 
company with HIH Hamburgische 
Immobilien Handlung, a specialist asset 
manager for the German property market.
By working closely together under the roof 
of a German Kapitalanlagegesellschaft, 
we launched our first fund in 2002, with 
the first acquisition being the OPEC 
building in Vienna. 
Our first pan-European fund followed soon 
after in July 2003, and over the following 
couple of years, we launched several  
more pan-European funds, investment 
programmes and club deals.
The partnership has proved extremely 
successful and is well established with 
€4.1bn AUM across 17 property funds with 
130 assets across 10 countries.

network which brought us a number of 
off-market deals. We also exited a number 
of investments where we had delivered on 
our business plan through either asset 
management or beneficial timing and where 
capital could be returned or re-invested. To 
ensure we deliver the best results for our 
clients, we take a long-term view on 
investment strategy and every transaction is 
considered accordingly.
Several of our larger specialist funds 
continued to be top performers in their 
sector e.g. the c.£1.1bn Henderson UK 
Retail Warehouse Fund was reported as 
being the top performing specialist retail 
warehouse fund for the year ended  
31 December 201 1. A number of our  
funds with absolute return objectives, remain 
challenged to reach benchmarks which 
were set pre downturn in 2007. However, 
the properties held within our funds 
compare very favourably to those of our 
peers and we are well placed to deliver 
long-term performance as a result of the 
strategies in place.
One of the highlights and most talked about 
property deals of the year was our acquisition 
of the ‘Leadenhall Triangle’ from its 
administrators. These properties are in one  
of the City of London’s largest development 
sites and were bought on behalf of our two 
Central London Office Funds and a Canadian 
wealth manager, Alberta Investment 
Management Corporation.
Total AUM increased from £806m to 
£955m as positive market and foreign 
exchange rate movements of £310m offset 
net outflows of £93m. Towards the end of 
the year, we sold our interest in Hermes 
GPE, a private equity fund of funds joint 
venture with Hermes Fund Managers, 
acquired as part of the Gartmore acquisition. 
In December 201 1, Henderson Equity 
Partners (GP) Limited and Henderson 
Equity Partners Limited, two subsidiaries of 
Henderson Group plc, were served with 
legal proceedings, which allege breach of 
mandate and misrepresentation, by a 
majority of the investors in Henderson PFI 
Secondary Fund II L.P. The proceedings do 
not quantify the sums claimed and will be 
defended vigorously.
In the infrastructure business, we continued 
to make good progress with fund valuations 
either improving or remaining stable in the 
12 month period to 30 September 201 1. 
Underlying this improvement was good 
trading at John Laing which saw new 
investment volumes resilient despite the 
impact of the UK Government’s austerity 
programme on infrastructure projects. At the 
same time, John Laing recorded further 
significant gains on the disposal of mature 
public-private partnership (PPP) assets to 
secondary investors. Our expectation is that 
the valuation of our infrastructure Fund I will 
continue to improve up to 31 December 
201 1. However, we expect that the valuation

progress in the John Laing business, will

Investment Trust plc, made significant 
progress in its realisation strategy, reducing 
its discount to net asset value to 20% from 
33%. It sold six limited partnership 
commitments and a direct investment 
holding during the year. The combination of 
asset sale proceeds and distributions from 
its remaining limited partnership fund 
investments allowed it to cancel its bank 
facilities in October. In December, the trust 
made an initial cash return of £12.4m to 
shareholders, representing 18% of the share 
capital in issue.
The unlisted global Fund of Funds continues 
to perform well and has now delivered a net

Employee compensation and benefits 
increased by £38.8m to £199.9m. Fixed 
staff costs increased by £12.9m as 
headcount rose by approximately 100, 
mainly due to Gartmore staff transferring  
to the Henderson business, and salary 
inflation. Variable staff costs increased by 
£25.9m, reflecting the staff’s share of 
higher performance fees and the increased 
number of staff, predominantly fund 
managers and distribution personnel, 
following the Gartmore acquisition. The 
average number of full-time employees

Review
Non-recurring items
The Group recognised four non-recurring 
items in FY1 1, resulting in a net post-tax 
charge of £34.1m. 
The cost of acquiring and integrating 
Gartmore amounted to £69.7m and, 
following the acquisition, a reassessment of 
previously unrecognised tax losses in the 
Group and Gartmore tax liabilities was 
carried out, resulting in the recognition  
of an £18.9m non-recurring tax credit. 
A further £6.0m of restructuring costs were 
incurred in 4Q1 1 as a result of cost saving 
measures taken in response to the market 
volatility in the second half of 201 1. 
Additionally, £6.5m of the void property 
provision was released relating to properties 
acquired at the time of the New Star 
acquisition. 
Please refer to note 7 to the Financial 
Statements on page 65 for a more  
detailed analysis.
Tax
The tax charge on underlying profit for the 
year was £33.6m resulting in an effective 
tax rate of 21.1%. The effective tax rate on 
underlying profit is less than the pro rata UK 
corporation tax rate of 26.5%, primarily as a 
result of the net favourable effects of 
different statutory tax rates applying to 
profits generated by non-UK subsidiaries. 
The effective tax rate has increased slightly 
in FY1 1 due to the impact of Gartmore, a 
predominantly UK business.
AUM and fund flows
Total AUM at 31 December 201 1 were 
£64.3bn, an increase of 4% compared to  
31 December 2010 as shown on page 17. 
Corporate activity added a net £1 1.7bn to 
AUM. The acquisition of Gartmore added 
£15.7bn, which was partially offset by the 
divestment of non-core businesses of 
£4.0bn which included the transfer of the 
HLAF to DB Advisors (£1.5bn), the sale of 
NSIM to Connor, Clark & Lunn UK Limited 
(£1.1bn) and the disposal of the Group’s 
interest in Hermes GPE (£1.4bn).
Market and FX movements during the year 
resulted in a further reduction of £2.7bn as 
global equity markets fell in 2H1 1 as a result 
of the eurozone sovereign debt crisis.
During the year the Group suffered 
significant net outflows totalling £6.4bn, 
predominantly in 2H1 1. In Retail we saw 
£1.4bn of net outflows, of which £0.3bn was

Investment performance 
Investment performance of the Group’s 
funds continues to remain good over three 
years although one year figures suffered 
slightly following lower Property 
performance and volatile markets in the 
second half of 201 1. Overall, 59% and 66% 
of funds exceeded their benchmarks over 
one and three years respectively. Looking at 
the various asset classes, 53% and 71% of 
Equity funds and 79% and 87% of Fixed 
Income funds were either achieving or 
beating their benchmarks for one year and 
three years respectively. Property 
performance was 48% and 23% for one 
year and three years respectively where in 
particular the effects of the property 
downturn in 2008 and 2009 continued to 
impact the longer term numbers.
Within Investment Management, 53% of 
Equity funds and 79% of Fixed Income 
funds achieved or beat their benchmarks 
over one year, improving to 71% and 87% 
respectively over three years. The UK retail 
and the SICAV fund ranges have both 
improved their performance over three years 
with 70% and 94% of assets respectively 
outperforming. Whilst remaining 
disappointing, the US retail range improved 
both its one year and three year 
performance over the period. In this range, 
the Henderson International Opportunities 
Fund, representing over half of US retail 
assets, remained below its benchmark. 
Segregated mandates continue to perform 
well with 71% and 97% of funds achieving 
or beating benchmark over one and three 
years respectively and despite a difficult 
environment for absolute return funds, 52% 
and 89% outperformed.
With the IPD Annual Benchmarks to  
be published in March 2012, Property 
investment performance included in the 
overall fund performance statistics remains 
an estimate derived from monthly data.

Gartmore acquisition
The acquisition of Gartmore completed on  
4 April 201 1 at a cost of £365.4m. The 
acquisition has enhanced the Group’s scale 
and product capability in the UK and 
European retail fund markets, providing a 
significant platform for future organic 
growth. In addition, the Group’s absolute 
return product offering has been 
significantly strengthened along with 
distribution capability in Asia, particularly 
Japan. As at 31 December, some 86% of 
the AUM (before market movements and net 
of notified redemptions at announcement) 
had been retained. The business is now fully 
integrated within the Group’s existing 
businesses and functions. 
The operating margin of the acquired 
Gartmore business has exceeded 50% and 
the integration has delivered significant 
enhancements in underlying earnings per 
share. Our annualised return on investment 
has exceeded our cost of capital.
As a result of the acquisition, we recognised 
intangible assets representing purchased 
goodwill of £238.3m and investment 
management contracts valued at £220.9m. 
The investment management contracts are 
being amortised on a straight-line basis over 
periods of between four and six years. The 
amortisation charge for FY1 1 was £30.1m. 
Total acquisition and integration costs 
incurred, totalled £69.7m before tax 
(£34.5m after tax and other tax benefits) 
and include costs related to staff, fund 
mergers, rebranding and office relocation 
and reorganisation. 16
Henderson Group 
Annual Report 201 1
Financial Review and KPIs continued
Liquidity and capital resources
The Group’s business continued to generate 
positive operating cash flows during 201 1 
with net cash flows from operating activities, 
after funding Gartmore integration costs, 
totalling £90.6m. Net cash flows from 
investing and financing activities were 
dominated by the funding for the acquisition 
of Gartmore, with the Group raising a net 
£1 16.7m in March 201 1 through the 
issuance of the 2016 Notes and the 
associated exchange of the 2012 Notes. 
Immediately following the Gartmore 
acquisition, the Group repaid Gartmore’s 
£245.4m euro and dollar denominated debt 
by utilising Gartmore’s cash resources and 
part of the proceeds of the debt issuance. 
During the year, the Group has recognised  
a £23.5m credit in the Consolidated 
Statement of Changes in Equity which 
represents monies unclaimed by former 
shareholders in respect of an exchange for 
the cancellation of shares in 2005. 
Cash and cash equivalents at 31 December 
201 1 were £273.9m, an increase of £97.3m 
in FY1 1 and gross debt, at par, amounted to 
£292.6m. Therefore, at 31 December 201 1 
net debt, excluding restricted and manager 
dealing account balances, stood at £28.0m. 
On 2 May 2012, the Group will repay the 
2012 Notes of £142.6m in full from its 
existing cash resources.
To ensure sufficient funds were available  
for the repayment of Gartmore debt and 
subsequent working capital, the Group 
entered into a £200m multicurrency term 
facility on 12 January 201 1. On 3 February 
2012, the remaining elements of this facility 
were cancelled. Also on 12 January 201 1, 
the Group entered into a £75m revolving 
credit facility which expires in April 2014. To 
date, this facility has not been drawn and 
remains available to the Group.
Pension schemes
The Group has five pension schemes. A 
defined benefit scheme and a defined 
contribution scheme, together forming the 
Henderson Group Pension Scheme (HGPS), 
the Gartmore Pension Scheme (GPS) and 
three smaller unapproved pension top-up 
schemes for former executives.
There was a net surplus in HGPS of 
£136.8m, after tax deducted at source, at 
31 December 201 1. The increase in the 
surplus was mainly due to better than 
expected returns on the assets and the 
move from the Retail Price Index to the 
Consumer Price Index as the basis for future 
increases in deferred pensions following 
legislation announced by the UK 
Government during the year. A reduction in 
the discount rate used to value the liabilities 
partially offset these gains. 
The defined benefit GPS, which is closed to 
future accrual, had a net surplus of £54.1m, 
after tax deducted at source, as at 31 
December 201 1. The increase in the surplus, 
since acquisition, arose as a result of better 
than expected returns on assets, partly 
offset by a reduced discount rate used to 
value the liabilities. The liability in respect of 
the Group’s unapproved pension schemes 
amounted to £6.5m at 31 December 201 1.
Regulatory requirements
The Group is subject to regulatory oversight 
and inspection by the FSA and other 
international regulatory bodies. 
Consequently, the Group’s internal controls, 
governance, procedures and capital are 
reviewed on a continuous basis. Both 
management and the Board of Directors 
ensure that the Group is compliant with its 
regulatory obligations at all times. In 201 1, 
as part of the Gartmore acquisition process, 
the Group was granted a new waiver from 
consolidated supervision which is valid until 
April 2016.
The regulatory capital surplus of the Group, 
under the parent financial holding company 
test, amounted to £623m at  
31 December 201 1 (2010: £304m). The 
increase in capital surplus is primarily as a 
result of shares issued in respect of the 
Gartmore acquisition. 
Dividends
The Board is recommending a final dividend 
for 201 1 of 5.05 pence per share which will 
bring the total dividend for the year to 7.0 
pence per share, an increase of 0.5 pence 
per share from 2010. The proposed final 
dividend will be paid on 25 May 2012 to 
shareholders on the register at 4 May 2012.
The Board has adopted a progressive 
dividend policy and will continue to apply a 
formula where the next interim dividend will 
be 30% of the total dividend of the previous 
year, assuming the Group has the resources 
to fund the dividend.
Case study
Operate efficiently:  
Fund rationalisation  
project
Following the acquisition of Gartmore, we 
embarked on an extensive programme to 
rationalise our fund range in order to 
reduce complexity, improve efficiency in 
our business and allow us to focus on key 
investment strategies.
In our UK retail business specifically, we 
identified a number of funds which were 
duplicates, subscale or had limited client 
demand. As a result, in 201 1 we merged 
22 funds with other larger funds. This 
programme, which will continue in 2012, 
will ultimately reduce the number of our 
UK retail funds by around 30%, help 
eliminate client and market confusion and 
result in a fund range that is more 
attractive to our retail clients.
For our institutional business, where we 
currently manage around 30 pooled funds, 
we will close subscale funds and 
undertake several initiatives to distinguish 
these from our more visible retail fund 
range. Although these changes are not 
difficult, they require operational and 
administrative change combined with clear 
client communications. We will continue to 
build our capabilities in strategies where 
we see long-term growth potential and 
where we have previously identified gaps.  17

Notes
1.  Since acquisition, after taking into account previously net notified redemptions, Gartmore outflows total £1,043m.
2.  These represent transfer of HLAF to DB Advisors, and sales of NSIM and Hermes GPE JV during 201 1.
3.  Private Equity AUM is based on 30 September 201 1 valuations.
4.   Private Equity AUM and net management fees (including Hermes JV) are excluded from this analysis due to the confidential nature of these fee arrangements and, therefore, also 
excluded from the average management fee basis. Our framework embeds the management of risk at all levels  
within our organisation. The framework also ensures that we  
meet our business objectives without exceeding our risk appetite  
and is subject to continuous review to ensure it recognises  
both new and emerging risks in the business. The risk  
management framework is set out in more detail in the  
Corporate Governance Statement.

Key

Liquidity
Description
The risk of organisational 
stress through the potential 
demands made on staff 
and resources through the 
need to integrate acquired 
businesses. This risk is 
aligned to the Group’s 
long-term strategy that 
involves willingness to 
consider the acquisition  
of businesses.
Description
The risk of a counterparty 
to the Group defaulting on 
funds deposited with it  
or the non-receipt of a 
trade debt.
Description
The risk that the Group will 
sustain losses through 
adverse movements in 
exchange rates.
Description
The risk of losing either a 
member of the Executive 
Committee (ExCo) or one 
of the Group’s key 
investment or distribution 
professionals. This could 
have an adverse effect on 
both the growth of the 
business and/or the 
retention of existing 
business.
Description
The risk that the Group 
may be unable to meet its 
payment obligations as 
they fall due.
Mitigation
We only consider 
acquisitions where they fit 
with our strategic goals 
and meet our financial 
criteria such that we can 
realise value for our 
shareholders. Thorough 
due diligence is performed 
before any acquisition is 
made and this includes 
assessing the ability of the 
Group to integrate 
successfully the acquired 
business. During the year, 
and as more fully explained 
on page 15, Gartmore was 
acquired and integrated 
successfully within the 
Henderson business. 
Governance structures 
were established to 
identify, monitor and 
control acquisition related 
risks. Acquisition 
integration activities have 
been completed.
Mitigation
We have an established 
credit risk policy to ensure 
counterparties meet 
minimum rating 
requirements consistent 
with the Group’s risk 
appetite. Furthermore, the 
Credit Risk Committee 
meets regularly to approve, 
review and set limits for all 
new and existing 
counterparties. As a result 
of the market conditions 
during 201 1, there has 
been heightened focus on 
monitoring counterparties 
and limits have been 
changed accordingly.
Mitigation
We mitigate this risk 
through either the effect of 
natural hedges i.e. holding 
financial assets and 
liabilities of equal value in 
the same currency, and by 
limiting the net exposure to 
an individual currency or by 
hedging exposure arising 
from available-for-sale 
securities. A Hedge 
Committee oversees the 
risk and reports to the 
Board monthly. As a result 
of the market conditions 
during 201 1, there has 
been heightened focus  
on monitoring euro 
denominated assets.
Mitigation
We operate competitive 
remuneration structures 
designed to recognise and 
reward performance. We 
also have succession 
planning to ensure that 
there is cover for key roles 
should they become 
vacant. In addition, staff 
surveys identify any issues 
which could adversely 
impact staff retention and 
comprehensive training is 
offered ensuring skills and 
knowledge reside in more 
than one individual.
Mitigation
We manage liquidity on  
a daily basis within the 
Finance function, to ensure 
the Group has sufficient 
cash and/or highly liquid 
assets available to meet its 
liabilities. The Group 
ensures that it has access 
to funds to cover all 
forecast commitments for 
at least the following 12 
months. Henderson does 
not bear any liquidity risk 
associated with our clients’ 
funds and has no 
obligation to provide 
short-term liquidity to  
our clients. 19

Key risks and their mitigation
The key risks faced by the Group fall into a number of distinct  
categories and the means adopted to mitigate them are both  
varied and relevant to the nature of the risk concerned. 
Go online www.henderson.com for the Group’s risk management and capital disclosures in accordance 
with chapter 1 1 of the FSA’s Prudential Sourcebook for Banks, Building Societies and Investment Firms 
(Pillar 3 disclosures).
Investment 
performance
Market Operational Regulatory/
legal
Reputational
Description
The risk that funds fail to 
achieve performance 
hurdles or benchmarks. 
This might cause clients to 
redeem their investments, 
which in turn would result 
in a reduction in revenue 
earned by the Group.  
Poor fund performance  
will also result in lower 
performance fees.
Description
The risk that market 
conditions lead to a decline 
in the value of Group 
available-for-sale financial 
assets and/or a reduction  
in the value of clients’ 
AUM, which would result  
in a reduction in the level  
of the revenue that is 
based on the value of 
clients’ AUM.
Description
The risk that the Group will 
sustain losses through 
inadequate or failed 
internal processes, people, 
systems and external 
events. This includes the 
risk arising from failing to 
manage key outsourced 
service providers properly 
and also the risk arising 
from business disruption 
(the occurrence of events 
which could have a material 
impact on the operations of 
the business).
Description
The risk that a change in 
laws and regulations will 
materially affect the 
Group’s business or 
markets in which it 
operates. The Group’s 
business is subject to many 
regulations in different 
jurisdictions and currently 
the pace of change is 
significant and may affect 
the business either directly 
or indirectly by reducing 
investors’ appetite for our 
products, increasing capital 
requirements or in some 
other way.
Description
The risk that negative 
publicity regarding the 
Group will lead  
to a loss of revenue or 
litigation. The risk of 
damage to the Group’s 
reputation is more likely to 
result from one of the risks 
materialising rather than as 
a standalone risk.
Mitigation
We mitigate this risk 
through a robust 
investment process which 
includes detailed research. 
We also have a clearly 
articulated investment 
philosophy and analyse our 
funds by comparing their 
performance against 
appropriate benchmarks. 
We also have a broad 
range of funds to reduce 
the probability of all funds 
underperforming at the 
same time.
Mitigation
We mitigate the risk on the 
Group’s available-for-sale 
assets by investing in a 
diversified range of assets 
and mitigate a fall in the 
value of clients’ AUM by 
having a broad range of 
clients by distribution 
channel, product, asset 
class and region. In 
addition, the Group actively 
seeks fee bases which are 
not solely related to one 
market value of AUM and 
makes a significant amount 
of its expense base 
variable. As explained more 
fully on page 15 staff costs 
have been reduced in the 
latter part of 201 1 in 
response to reduced 
market levels in order to 
maintain an acceptable 
level of profitability.
Mitigation
We operate a system of 
controls which is designed 
to ensure operational risks 
are mitigated to an 
acceptable level. The 
operation and 
effectiveness of the 
controls are regularly 
assessed and confirmed 
through the work of the 
Group’s assurance 
functions: Risk, 
Compliance and Internal 
Audit. Outsourced service 
providers are overseen by 
the relevant line function 
and, for key relationships, 
their controls are also 
reviewed by the Group’s 
assurance functions. We 
maintain and test business 
continuity plans which are 
designed to ensure that, 
should an event occur 
which disrupts business 
activity, we are able to 
maintain our operations 
without irreparable damage 
being done to the business.
Mitigation
We continuously monitor 
regulatory developments 
and where there is likely to 
be an impact, we have 
working groups in place to 
implement the changes. 
The Compliance team in 
particular monitors ongoing 
regulatory obligations and 
engages in dialogue with 
our main regulator.
Mitigation
We believe that 
reputational risk is 
mitigated through the 
effective mitigation  
of the other key risks. In 
addition, we regularly 
update clients and the 
market and in doing so, 
mitigate the risk of 
reputational damage.

Aims and objectives
We seek to operate high standards of 
corporate governance and aim to take  
an active approach to voting in investee 
companies.
Our adoption of the UN Principles for 
Responsible Investment (PRI) creates a 
framework for considering environment, 
social and governance (ESG) issues that 
have the potential to add value to our 
investment decisions.
As well as managing Sustainable and 
Responsible Investment (SRI) funds where 
ESG issues are proactively considered, we 
have a Responsible Investment Policy that 
outlines our commitment to integrate ESG  
in our non-SRI equity funds. 
Our property assets also have Responsible 
Development and Investment Policies.
Progress in 2011
• 
 Key ESG issues were analysed and 
formed the basis of our engagement on 
matters related to corporate governance, 
climate change and human rights.
• 
 We participated in additional ESG-related 
initiatives, by signing up to the PRI-led 
Sustainable Fisheries Engagement and 
New Analyst Call projects, and becoming 
a member of the Asian Corporate 
Governance Association. Other key ESG 
initiatives we participated in included the 
Carbon Disclosure Project (CDP), the 
Institutional Investor Group on Climate 
Change, Better Building Partnership 
and s-i-r-e (Sustainable Investment in 
Real Estate).
• 
 We ran a Europe-wide programme  
to measure carbon emissions, water 
consumption and waste management 
within the Property business, setting 
targets to improve the environmental  
and social impacts of our assets  
under management.
• 
 We were awarded 4 ‘Green Stars’ in the 
201 1 Global Real Estate Sustainability 
Benchmark for our Shopping Centre 
Fund, Retail Warehouse Fund, Central 
London Office Fund and European Outlet 
Mall Fund.
• 
 We expanded the scope in our 
Investment Management business of 
the Responsible Investment Policy to 
incorporate the fixed income asset class 
and included a representative of fixed 
income on our Responsible Investment 
Committee, which oversees the 
implementation of policy.
2012 plans
• 
 Maintain high standards of customer care 
and explore ways to integrate ESG factors 
across all our asset classes.
• 
 Further develop our internal systems used 
for capturing and reporting our 
engagement with companies we invest in, 
as part of our commitment to the UK 
Stewardship Code.
• 
 Analyse compliance with the core 
elements of the Global Compact, a 
strategic policy intiative designed for 
businesses that are committed to aligning 
their operations and strategies with 10 
universally accepted principles. We will 
cover all our major equity holdings, and 
seek to engage with non-compliant 
companies to improve their performance.
• 
 Report in line with new property specific 
industry guidance including the Global 
Reporting Initiative Construction and Real 
Estate Sector Supplement and 
Sustainability Reporting 
Recommendations.

 We continued to roll out a new learning 
and development platform with 33% of 
staff attending one session or more.
• 
 Since its inception in June 2010, we have 
taken on 49 trainees onto our trainee 
programme. 75% of those who have 
completed the scheme have gained 
permanent employment with the Group. 
A sustainable approach to business
We are committed to interacting responsibly with all of our stakeholders and have 
built our corporate responsibility around four main pillars as summarised below. 
Our commitment and efforts in these areas have been recognised externally 
through continued inclusion in the FTSE4Good UK Index. We also comply with 
the principles of the UK Stewardship Code.

Business 
Review
• 
 We made our share schemes available  
to all staff in all locations.
• 
 88% of employees contributed to  
share schemes. 
• 
 We won two Shareplan Awards for most 
effective communication and best overall 
performance in fostering employee  
share ownership.
• 
 We actively promote vacancies on our 
intranet site to encourage employees  
to consider other opportunities within  
the Group, thereby potentially filling 
vacancies internally.
2012 plans
• 
 Use staff survey results to identify areas 
for potential improvement. 
• 
 Encourage employees to make further 
use of our learning and development 
courses.
• 
 Promote staff share schemes, especially 
for non-UK employees.
• 
 Build on the success of our trainee 
programme and encourage more 
apprenticeships.
Environment
Aims and objectives
We follow responsible environmental 
practices for all Group operations and  
aim to minimise any adverse impact on  
the environment. 
We continue to measure our emissions and 
carbon footprint for all energy consumption, 
business travel and waste generation and 
aim to retain our status as a CarbonNeutral 
Company by procuring credits through 
verified carbon offset schemes.
Progress in 2011
• 
 We maintained our status as a 
CarbonNeutral Company by becoming 
more efficient and offsetting our net 
emissions of 2,918 tonnes CO2e.
• 
 We sourced a carbon offset portfolio of 
emission reduction projects including: 
wind power, methane capture and forestry 
located across Asia and the US.
• 
 Despite growing global headcount by 1 1% 
in 201 1, the carbon footprint of the 
business increased by just 1%.

  Based on CDP analysis prepared by 
The CarbonNeutral Company, we ranked 
sixth out of 24 based on emissions per 
employee within the capital markets 
sector. Our global emissions per employee 
were 4.0 tonnes CO2e (4.3 in 2010).
• 
 We procured energy from renewable 
sources at our London office and offset 
our residual carbon footprint.
• 
 The energy monitoring system introduced 
in the London office in 2010, helped 
deliver a 5% energy reduction in 201 1.
• 
 All waste reduction, re-use and recycle 
schemes operated effectively. From the 
London office, 72.6 tonnes of paper was 
recycled and 72.5 tonnes of general 
waste incinerated. Nothing was sent  
to landfill.
• 
 We received a Platinum Award for our 
submission to the Corporation of London 
Clean City Awards Scheme.
• 
 An additional 27 staff joined the cycle to 
work scheme and we now have 10% of 
UK employees participating in the 
scheme which was introduced in 2009.
• 
 We are members of the Broadgate 
Environmental Working Group and the 
City Environmental Forum to share our 
best practice and environmental 
initiatives.
2012 plans
• 
 Maintain our status as a CarbonNeutral 
Company and focus on our energy 
reduction programme in our London office.
• 
 Maintain and develop our waste 
management, re-use and recycling 
programme.
• 
 Engage in a government backed scheme 
to perform a third party building survey on 
the London office to monitor whether the 
building has met design specification and 
therefore whether energy usage has 
been efficient.
Community and 
supply chain
Aims and objectives
We aim to foster positive relationships with 
the local London community, as this is 
where the majority of our staff work. 
Activities focus on employee involvement 
and charitable donations, and we encourage 
staff participation by matching money 
raised, pound for pound.
We also aim to ensure that our suppliers and 
service providers operate responsible labour 
and environmental practices, and have 
practices in line with our Corporate 
Responsibility Policy. 
Progress in 2011
• 
 We continued our support of Community 
Links, our preferred charity since 1987. 
This is an inner city charity running 
community based projects in East 
London, close to the London office. 
• 
 We donated a total of £149,532 to 
community and charitable purposes, 
compared with £35,938 in 2010. In 
addition to staff related fund raising of 
£74,532, we donated £50,000 to the 
Isaac Newton Institute, a leading 
mathematics institute, and £25,000 to 
The Carers Resource, a charity providing 
support to carers throughout the UK. 
• 
 Employee matching grants made in  
201 1 were £45,247, an increase of  
131% from 2010.
2012 plans
• 
 Continue to promote staff involvement  
in the local community and encourage 
further participation in our Give As You 
Earn scheme.
• 
 Review corporate procurement so that 
good sustainability practices can continue 
to be incorporated.
 
Andrew Formica presented Geraldine Blake,  
the Chief Executive of Community Links with  
a cheque for £14,765 which was raised from  
the fund raising events over Christmas 2011. 22

The City of London Investment Trust plc 
(City of London) is Henderson’s biggest 
investment trust client with over £700m 
AUM and a share register consisting 
mostly of wealth managers and  
private investors. 
In 201 1, the City of London board was 
keen to learn how the trust could meet 
investors’ needs, and open up new  
sources of demand for shares in the  
trust, once the Retail Distribution Review 
(RDR) was implemented.
Our investment trust team shared the 
board’s enthusiasm for providing the  
IFA market with alternative solutions  
in a post-RDR world. We saw the  
potential for the City of London to  
be a key product offering in the UK 
Growth and Income space. 
As such, marketing and client 
communications on the City of London 
were tailored specifically for the IFA 
community, and promoting the trust 
remains a key objective for our sales  
and marketing team.
Our People
Culture
At Henderson, we aim to create a culture 
that has our clients’ interests at the heart of 
every action we take. Our employment 
practices are designed to help us create a 
workplace in which all employees are 
respected, valued by and engaged with the 
organisation. We invest in our employees’ 
careers, providing learning and development 
opportunities to improve their performance 
and progression. Our reward strategy not 
only helps create a winning culture but is 
aligned with the interests of our clients  
and shareholders.
Diversity
As a global organisation, Henderson 
employs around 1,000 staff across 19 
countries, represented by over 40 
nationalities. 38% of our workforce are 
women and the proportion of women in senior 
roles has also remained broadly consistent 
during 201 1.
Engagement
We believe that an engaged workforce 
delivers outstanding client service and helps 
drive business performance. In our most 
recent confidential staff survey we achieved 
a 78% response rate. In general the results 
were substantially ahead of the industry 
benchmark. Results in 201 1 showed a small 
improvement in the areas of Customer 
Focus and Commitment/Engagement. 
Results were broadly flat in My Line 
Manager and Reward and slightly down  
in My Job. 
We aim to provide a working environment 
where staff are encouraged to develop their 
professional skills. We believe that 
developing and nurturing talent remains 
critical to our success and helps contribute 
towards our high staff retention rates, as 
reflected in the chart below.

Henderson Group 
Annual Report 201 1
Principal activities
The principal activity of the Group was the 
provision of investment management services.
Future developments and  
business review
The Group’s results for the year are shown 
in the Consolidated Income Statement on 
page 52. The Business Review, which is set 
out on pages 2 to 22, is incorporated into 
and forms part of this Directors’ Report. 
Future developments are included in the 
Chairman’s Statement on page 7 and the 
Chief Executive’s Review on pages 8 to 10. 
The Financial Review and KPIs are set out 
on pages 14 to 17.
Corporate governance
The Corporate Governance Statement 
appears on pages 29 to 38 and forms part 
of this Directors’ Report.
Branches
The Group continues to operate a number of 
overseas branches.
Reporting
Shares in Henderson Group plc are listed on 
both the LSE and the ASX (in the form of 
CHESS Depositary Interests (CDIs)) and 
therefore the Company is required to comply 
with both sets of disclosure requirements.
Events after the reporting date
The Board has not received, as at 28 
February 2012, being the date on which  
the Annual Report and Accounts were 
approved, any information concerning 
significant conditions in existence at the 
reporting date which have not been 
reflected in the Consolidated Financial 
Statements as presented. 
Directors
Details of the Board members who served 
during the year and at the date of this report 
are set out on pages 24 and 25.
In accordance with the Company’s Articles 
of Association, one third of the Directors of 
the Company are required to retire by 
rotation at each AGM. The retiring Directors 
are eligible to stand for reappointment by 
shareholders. The Board may appoint 
Directors to the Board without shareholder 
approval. Any Director so appointed must 
stand for reappointment by the shareholders 
at the next AGM in accordance with the 
Articles of Association. In accordance with 
the UK Corporate Governance Code, all 
Directors will offer themselves for 
reappointment at the AGM on 2 May 2012, 
except for Mr Aherne who is standing down 
at the AGM.
Pursuant to the Articles of Association, 
shareholders may remove a Director before 
the end of his or her term by passing an 
ordinary resolution at a meeting. An ordinary 
resolution is passed if more than 50% of the 
votes cast, in person or by proxy, are in 
favour of the resolution.
Directors’ remuneration and interests
A report on Directors’ remuneration appears 
on pages 39 to 48, including details of 
Directors’ interests in shares and share 
options or any right to subscribe for shares 
in the Company.
Conflicts of interest
The Directors have put in place procedures 
to deal with conflicts of interest and these 
have operated effectively throughout 201 1. 
A Register of Conflicts of Interest is 
maintained by the Company and reviewed by 
the Board on an annual basis. Any Director 
who is considering accepting a new external 
appointment must provide full details of the 
appointment to the Chairman and Company 
Secretary. In some cases, the interest or 
duty of someone who is connected with a 
Director may give rise to a potential conflict 
of interest and details of that must also be 
provided to the Chairman and Company 
Secretary. The Chairman will then decide 
whether the relevant appointment causes a 
conflict or potential conflict of interest and 
should therefore be considered by the 
Board. If it is considered and approved  
by the Board, such interest or potential 
interest is added to the Register of  
Conflicts of Interest.
Indemnification and insurance of 
Directors and Officers
The Company provides an Instrument of 
Indemnity to Directors to the extent 
permitted by Jersey law, including (i) 
indemnification against any liabilities 
incurred in defending any proceedings in 
which judgment is given in that Director’s 
favour or the Director is acquitted; (ii) 
against liabilities incurred otherwise than to 
the Company, if the Director acted in good 
faith with a view to the best interests of the 
Company; and (iii) against any liabilities 
incurred in successfully applying to the Court 
for relief where the Director acted honestly.
In addition, the Instrument of Indemnity 
provides that Directors will have access  
to Board and Committee papers of the 
Company for the period of their office  
and for seven years after ceasing to be a 
Director for the purpose of defending legal 
proceedings, and that the Company will 
maintain Directors’ and Officers’ liability 
insurance cover for the Directors to the 
extent permitted by law for the period of 
their office.
During, or since the end of the financial year, 
the Company has paid or agreed to pay 
premiums in respect of a contract insuring 
all of the Officers (including all Directors) of 
the Group against certain liabilities. The 
insurance policy prohibits disclosure of the 
nature of the liability, the amount of the 
premium and the limit of liability.
Financial instruments
Information regarding the risk management 
objectives, policies and related matters in 
respect of the use of financial instruments, 
including policies for hedging and the 
exposure to price, interest rate, liquidity, 
foreign currency and credit risks, can be 
found in note 28 to the Financial Statements.
Political donations
The Group made no UK political donations, 
incurred no European Union political 
expenditure and made no contributions to 
non-European Union political parties during 
the year.
Charitable donations
Donations by the Group during the year 
towards community and charitable causes 
amounted to £149,532 (2010: £35,938), 
which comprised social and welfare 
£27,920 (2010: £7,61 1), education and 
non-UK £13,530 (2010: £6,845), and 
medical and other projects £108,082  
(2010: £21,482).
Supplier payment policy
The Company has no trade creditors. It  
is the Group’s policy that payments to 
suppliers are made in accordance with  
the terms and conditions agreed between 
Group companies and their suppliers, 
provided that all trading terms and 
conditions have been complied with. In 
respect of the Group’s activities, the 
amounts due to trade creditors as at  
31 December 201 1 represent approximately 
30 days of average daily purchases 
throughout the year (2010: 30 days).
Rounding
In accordance with the Australian Securities 
and Investments Commission Class Order 
98/100, amounts in this Directors’ Report 
and other sections of this Annual Report 
and Accounts have been rounded to the 
nearest £0.1m, unless stated otherwise.

A separate document, the Notice of Annual 
General Meeting 2012, covering the AGM of 
the Company to be held on 2 May 2012, will

business before that meeting.

shares of 12.5 pence each. Each share 
ranks equally and carries the same right to 
receive dividends and other distributions 
declared, made or paid by the Company. No 
restrictions exist on the transfer or holding 
of securities in the Company under its 
Articles of Association and there are no 
shares carrying special rights with regard to 
the control of the Company.
Substantial shareholdings
At 28 February 2012, in accordance with 
the provisions of Rule 5 of the Disclosure 
and Transparency Rules, the Company had 
received notification of direct and indirect 
holdings in the Company’s issued share 
capital as set out in the table below.
Employee share schemes
The Company has a number of employee 
share schemes. The rights attached to the 
shares of several of the share schemes are 
not exercisable directly by employees. The 
trustees of such share schemes have an 
obligation to act in the best interests of the 
beneficiaries of the share schemes and, 
although the trustees may consider any 
recommendations made by the Company, 
where applicable, the discretion to vote 
remains with the trustees with two 
exceptions: firstly, in cases of takeover or 
reconstruction, the employees do have a 
right to vote via the trustees and secondly, 
the trustee of the Henderson Group plc  
Buy As You Earn Share Plan, and its 
international equivalent, does not have 
discretion on how to vote. For these  
plans, the trustee seeks instructions  
from the employees beneficially entitled  
to the shares.
Restrictions on voting rights
All shareholders entitled to attend and vote 
at Company meetings are also entitled to 
appoint a proxy to attend, speak and vote on 
their behalf. A member may appoint more 
than one proxy. Proxy forms must be 
received not less than 48 hours before the 
time appointed for holding a meeting, as set 
out in any notices concerning a general 
meeting or in any proxy form sent by or on 
behalf of the Company in relation to a 
meeting. In addition, the Companies 
(Uncertificated Securities) (Jersey) Order 
1999 provides for a time to be specified in 
the notice of meeting for determining 
attendance and voting entitlements. This 
time may not be more than 48 hours before 
the meeting. Further details are set out in 
any Notice of Meeting issued by the 
Company from time to time.
Amendment to the Articles of 
Association of the Company
Under the Companies (Jersey) Law 1991, 
the Company may only amend its Articles of 
Association if its shareholders pass a 
special resolution to that effect. A special 
resolution is passed if two thirds or more of 
the votes cast, in person or by proxy, are in 
favour of the resolution.
New issues of share capital and 
disapplication of pre-emption rights
Under the Company’s Articles of 
Association, the Directors of the Company 
are, with certain exceptions, unable to allot 
any ordinary shares without express 
authorisation which cannot last more than 
five years. The Company follows best 
practice and asks shareholders to grant 
such authority on an annual basis. Under the 
Company’s Articles of Association, the 
Board may not allot ordinary shares for cash, 
other than pursuant to an employee share 
scheme, without first making an offer to 
existing shareholders to allot such shares to 
them on the same or more favourable terms 
in proportion to their respective 
shareholdings, unless this requirement is 
waived by a resolution of the shareholders 
passed by a majority of at least three 
quarters of the holders of the shares who 
vote in person or by proxy in favour of the 
resolution.
The Directors have been authorised by 
shareholders to allot the Company’s 
unissued shares up to an aggregate nominal 
amount of £34,000,000, or £68,000,000 
when in connection with an offer of equity 
securities by way of a rights issue to 
shareholders in proportion to their existing 
holdings. The former amount represented 
less than one third of the Company’s issued 
ordinary share capital as at 31 December 
201 1. As at 28 February 2012, the Company 
has authority to allot shares up to a nominal 
value of £33,922,249.50, or 
£67,922,249.50 when in connection with an 
offer of equity securities by way of a rights 
issue to shareholders in proportion to their 
existing holdings. Shareholders will be asked 
to renew this authority up to a limit of 
£45,800,000, or £91,600,000 when in 
connection with an offer of equity securities 
by way of a rights issue to shareholders in 
proportion to their existing holdings, at the 
AGM on 2 May 2012. The latter allotment 
ceiling of up to two thirds of the nominal 
value of the issued shares is in accordance 
with guidelines issued by the Association of 
British Insurers.
The Directors have authority to allot equity 
securities for cash or sell ordinary shares 
held in treasury (treasury shares) for cash on 
a non-pre-emptive basis: (a) pursuant to a 
rights issue; or (b) up to an aggregate 
nominal amount of £5,000,000. This 
empowers the Company to make limited 
allotments of unissued equity shares of the 
Company or certain rights to acquire such 
shares (equity securities) and to sell treasury 
shares for cash other than in accordance 
with the pre-emption rights in the Articles of 
Association. This amount represents less 
than 5% of the Company’s issued share 
capital. Shareholders will be asked to renew 
this authority up to a limit of £6,875,000 at 
the AGM on 2 May 2012.
Purchase of own share capital
Subject to authorisation by a special 
resolution passed by shareholders, the 
Company may purchase its own shares in 
accordance with the Companies (Jersey) 
Law 1991. Any shares which have been 
bought back may be held as treasury shares 
or, if not so held, would be cancelled, thereby 
reducing the amount of issued share capital. 
The Directors have shareholder authority to 
buy back up to 80,000,000 ordinary shares 
during the period up to the forthcoming 
AGM. The maximum number of ordinary 
shares authorised to be purchased is 
80,000,000 minus the number of shares 
purchased pursuant to any purchases of 
CDIs made under a Contingent Purchase 
Contract (CP Contract). The minimum price 
(exclusive of expenses) which may be paid 
for an ordinary share is 12.5 pence (being 
the nominal value of an ordinary share). The 
maximum price (exclusive of expenses) 
which may be paid for each ordinary share is 
the higher of: (a) an amount equal to 105% 
of the average of the middle market 
quotations for an ordinary share as derived 
from the LSE Daily Official List for the five 
business days immediately preceding the 
day on which the share is contracted to be 
purchased; and (b) an amount equal to the 
higher of the price of the last independent 
trade of an ordinary share and the highest 
current independent bid for an ordinary

share as derived from the LSE Trading 
System. No ordinary shares were bought 
back by the Company during 201 1.
The Directors consider that it may be 
advantageous for the Company to buy back 
interests in its own CDIs in certain 
circumstances. However, because CDIs are 
interests in shares, rather than shares 
themselves, the Companies (Jersey) Law 
1991 provisions which provide for a buy 
back of shares do not apply to CDIs. The 
Company, therefore, cannot buy CDIs 
pursuant to the above authority.
The Company achieves a similar result by 
entering into a CP Contract with Credit 
Suisse (Australia) Limited and certain of its 
affiliates (Credit Suisse) as identified in the 
CP Contract. Credit Suisse would buy the 
CDIs in Australia and then convert the CDIs 
into shares (Converted Shares). The 
Company would then have an obligation to 
buy any Converted Shares from Credit 
Suisse up to a maximum amount.
The Companies (Jersey) Law 1991 provides 
that a CP Contract must be approved by 
shareholders by special resolution. No 
Converted Shares were bought back by the 
Company during 201 1.
The maximum number of Converted Shares 
which could be bought back by the 
Company, together with the number of 
shares bought back by the Company under 
the authority to purchase its own shares set 
out above, is limited to 80,000,000, which 
represented under 10% of the Company’s 
issued share capital at 28 February 2012. 
Shareholders will be asked to renew these 
authorities up to a limit of 1 10,000,000 
ordinary shares at the AGM on 2 May 2012.

Directors’ statement as to disclosure of 
information to auditors
The Directors who were members of the 
Board at the time of approving this Directors’ 
Report are listed on pages 24 and 25. 
Having made enquiries of fellow Directors 
and of the Company’s auditors, each of 
these Directors confirms that:
• 
 so far as the Director is aware, there is no 
relevant audit information needed by the 
Company’s auditors in connection with 
preparing their report of which the 
Company’s auditors are unaware; and
• 
 the Director has taken all the steps that 
he or she ought to have taken as a 
Director in order to make themselves 
aware of any relevant audit information 
needed by the Company’s auditors in 
connection with preparing their report and 
to establish that the Company’s auditors 
are aware of that information.

diversity are fundamental to our success 
and how we attract and retain high potential 
employees and to the operation of our 
business. Our policies, employee benefits 
and business practices support a diverse 
workforce. There is more information about 
diversity at Henderson elsewhere in this 
statement on page 31. 
A description of our business model and our 
strategy for achieving our goals is set out on 
pages 2 and 3.
In the future as in the past, macroeconomic 
conditions and regulation will test our 
corporate governance and keep us all on  
our toes.
UK Corporate Governance Code and 
ASX Principles
The Directors embrace, and are subject to, 
the high standards of corporate governance 
contained in the UK Corporate Governance 
Code issued by the Financial Reporting 
Council (FRC) in June 2010 (UK Code) and 
the Corporate Governance Principles and 
Recommendations with 2010 Amendments 
issued by the ASX Corporate Governance 
Council in June 2010 (ASX Principles). The 
UK Code and the ASX Principles can be 
found on the websites of their respective 
organisations at www.frc.org.uk and  
www.asx.com.au. The Company’s corporate 
governance policies can be found at  
www.henderson.com (our website). 
The Company complied with the UK Code 
and the ASX Principles in 201 1 except in 
regard to the setting and disclosure of 
gender diversity targets. We welcome the 
recent initiatives on diversity, including the 
focus on gender diversity on boards and in 
senior management. However, we believe 
that the setting of meaningful, achievable 
targets along with the associated review of 
selection criteria and procedures is a 
considerable task for any organisation, and 
throughout the last 12-18 months the major 
focus of the Board and management has 
been the acquisition and integration of the 
Gartmore business and managing the 
combined business as effectively as 
possible in volatile and depressed 
investment markets. This statement, 
together with the Report on Directors’ 
Remuneration, describes how we applied 
the ‘main principles’ set out in the UK Code 
and complied with the ASX Principles. 
Further details can be found in the corporate 
governance section of our website. The ASX 
Principles also encourage companies that 
are not subject to the Australian 
Corporations Act 2001 to adopt practices 
and make disclosures to achieve the aims of 
the provisions contained in certain sections 
 We embrace and are 
subject to high standards

Chairman’s introduction 
Last year was a busy time for the Board 
particularly because of the Gartmore 
acquisition: my thanks to the Non-Executive 
Directors for providing invaluable support 
and time, including attending additional 
meetings at short notice.
To strengthen our governance and support 
the growth of our business, we appointed 
Kevin Dolan as a Non-Executive Director 
with effect from 26 September 201 1 and 
James Darkins and David Jacob as 
Executive Directors with effect from  
4 May 201 1. Mr Dolan brings additional 
international experience to the Board and 
the appointment of Messrs Darkins and 
Jacob strengthens the links between the 
Board and the business and the speed and 
quality of decision making. We also 
refreshed the membership of our Board 
Committees in line with good practice.
We welcome the recent recommendations 
and proposals on diversity. Currently, women 
make up 10% of the Board, 20% of our 
senior management and 38% of our total 
2011 was a busy year for the 
Board especially as a result

of that Act. We achieved the aims of some of 
those provisions, although not fully on senior 
executives’ remuneration, as the disclosures 
of individuals’ remuneration is limited to the 
four executives who are members of the 
Board. Disclosure of the remuneration of 
non-directors is not a  requirement in the UK 
and we consider this information to be 
commercially sensitive. However, we have 
disclosed the aggregate annual 
remuneration of Code Staff (as defined on 
page 47 in the Report on Directors’ 
Remuneration) on page 48. 
The Board’s structure
The Board comprises a Non-Executive 
Chairman, four Executive Directors and five 
other Non-Executive Directors. Biographical 
details of the Directors are set out on pages 
24 and 25.
Although the Chairman, Rupert Pennant-
Rea, met the independence criteria on 
appointment, the UK Code provides that the 
test of independence is not appropriate 
thereafter. We consider all the other 
Non-Executive Directors – Gerald Aherne, 
Kevin Dolan, Duncan Ferguson, Tim How 
and Robert Jeens – to be independent, as 
they do not have any interest or business or 
other relationship which could, or could 
reasonably be perceived to, interfere 
materially with their ability to act in the best 
interests of the Company. We have 
considered the criteria proposed by the UK 
Code and the ASX Principles in assessing 
the independence of the Directors. 
Materiality, as referred to in the ASX 
Principles, has been assessed on a 
case-by-case basis by reference to each 
Director’s individual circumstances rather 
than general materiality thresholds. We are 
satisfied that the independent Directors 
meet a quantitative materiality threshold for 
independence, which is that no Director has 
a relationship with the Group which 
generates or accounts for more than 5% of 
the Group’s revenue or expenses. 
Accordingly, the Board (excluding the 
Chairman) has a majority of Directors who 
are independent. Tim How is the Senior 
Independent Director.
There is a division of responsibility between 
the Chairman, who is responsible for leading 
the Board and ensuring its effectiveness, and 
the Chief Executive who is responsible to the 
Board for the overall management and 
performance of the Group. The Chairman’s 
other significant commitments, and changes 
to them during 201 1, are shown in the Board 
of Directors section on page 24.
Non-Executive Directors are initially 
appointed for a fixed term, normally of three 
years, and any subsequent terms are 
considered by the Board. If a Non-Executive 
Director is reappointed after having served 
six years, such reappointment, and any 
subsequent reappointment, will normally be 
for a period of 12 months. The remuneration 
of the Non-Executive Directors is shown on 
page 44. The terms and conditions of their 
appointment are on our website, as is the 
process for their appointment and 
reappointment.
At our Annual General Meeting (AGM) held 
on 4 May 201 1, shareholders reappointed 
Gerald Aherne, Duncan Ferguson, Andrew 
Formica, Shirley Garrood, Tim How, Robert 
Jeens and Rupert Pennant-Rea as 
Directors. Our next AGM is due to take 
place on 2 May 2012, when all Directors will 
be seeking reappointment in accordance 
with the recommendations of the UK Code. 
The one exception is Gerald Aherne, who 
will be standing down as a Non-Executive 
Director at that time.

Annual Report 201 1
Governance
Diversity
Our human resource policies and staff 
benefits aim to attract and retain a diverse 
and flexible workforce. In order to assist us 
in monitoring our progress on gender 
diversity, senior management review 
statistics on numbers and proportions of 
men and women in the workplace generally 
and broken down by: working patterns; 
status; length of service; turnover; region; 
division; and salary band.
We apply the same principles at Board level. 
Candidates for appointment to the Board 
are identified taking into account:
• 
 the current composition of the Board, with 
due regard for the benefits of diversity on 
the Board, including gender;
• 
the need for independence, if necessary;
• 
 the strategic direction and progress of the 
business; and
• 
 the geographic spread and diversity of  
the Group. 
Responsibilities and 
operation of the Board
The Board met 17 times in 201 1, of which 
seven were scheduled meetings. The Board 
and the Remuneration Committee met in 
Paris in January 201 1 and the Board, 
Remuneration Committee and Board Risk 
Committee met in Chicago in October. All 
other Board and standing Board Committee 
meetings were held in Ireland. The number 
of meetings held by the standing 
Committees during the year are set out 
elsewhere in this statement. 
We are scheduled to meet at least seven 
times in 2012. Additional meetings will be 
held as required, or at the request of a 
Director. During 201 1, the other Non-
Executive Directors met the Chairman 
without the Executive Directors being 
present and this practice will continue  
in 2012.
We are responsible for making all key 
strategic, management and commercial 
decisions. During each meeting, Directors 
are given the opportunity to question and 
challenge any initiatives and proposals from 
management. The Board held two meetings 
dedicated to strategy, in addition to 
considering regular strategy updates from 
management during the year. Most 
members of the Board also attended the 
senior management conference held in  
May 201 1.
To enable us, as a Board, to perform our role 
effectively, we are provided with the means 
and information necessary for us to make 
Gender diversity

informed decisions and to follow best 
corporate governance practices. In addition, 
the Chairman, Chief Executive and Chief 
Financial Officer hold agenda-setting 
meetings before each Board meeting to 
review the items of business, the likely time 
to be spent on each agenda item, who 
should present particular items and to 
ensure that appropriate papers are provided 
to us. 
We receive detailed reports on the various 
aspects of the business and of any major 
issues affecting it, which includes a monthly 
performance report. An overview of the 
matters considered by the Board in 201 1  
is outlined on page 33.
We reviewed and approved our corporate 
governance policies and manual in 201 1. 
These include, but are not limited to, an 
overview of the Company’s corporate 
governance procedures, a policy on trading 
in the shares of the Company by Directors 
and employees and the Code of Conduct 
which sets out our values and standards.  
We have a Market Disclosure and 
Communication Policy designed to ensure 
compliance with our disclosure obligations 
and a Chief Disclosure Officer to oversee 
this. Together, these corporate governance 
policies set a framework within which the 
Directors and other employees are expected 
to protect the interests of shareholders, 
clients, employees and suppliers. These 
policies and other corporate governance 
documents are on our website.
All Directors have access to the advice and 
services of both of the Company Secretary 
and the General Counsel. The Company 
Secretary can be appointed or removed only 
with the approval of the Board. The 
Directors are entitled to seek independent 
professional advice, at the Company’s 
expense, where they judge it necessary for 
them to discharge their responsibilities.
Training
To ensure that the Directors continually 
update their skills and knowledge, all 
Directors receive regular presentations on 
different aspects of the Group’s business 
and on financial, legal and regulatory 
matters affecting our sector. For example, 
during 201 1, the Directors received 
presentations which included the use of 
derivatives, the Bribery Act 2010, current 
and future trends in fund management and 
competitor analysis. At our meeting in 
Chicago, we received presentations on the 
US asset management landscape and key 
trends in the US registered funds market.
Evaluation of the Board’s performance
We decided to have an external evaluation 
for 201 1. Three candidates were selected 
from a number of companies. They were 
then invited to make presentations to the 
Chairman and the Senior Independent 
Director, following which Independent Board 
Evaluation (IBE) were engaged to conduct 
the process described below. IBE has no 
other connections with the Company.
IBE held interviews with each of the 
Directors and attended one of the 
scheduled Board and Committee meetings. 
IBE subsequently held discussions with the 
Board and Committee Chairmen to discuss 
the results and presented its 
recommendations to the Board. 
The results of the evaluation will be 
considered further by the Board and  
the implementation of any actions will  
be monitored.
The performance of Andrew Formica, Chief 
Executive, was evaluated by the Chairman 
and the Remuneraton Committee. The 
evaluation of the members of the Executive 
Committee (ExCo) was undertaken by the 
Chief Executive and the Remuneration 
Committee. 
Treating Customers Fairly
We believe that Treating Customers Fairly (TCF), promoted by FSA is embedded within the 
culture and procedures of the Group. TCF, amongst other priorities, is intended to promote fair 
treatment of customers by regulated firms throughout the product life cycle, from design to 
post-sales support. We always aim to:
• 
treat our clients fairly;
• 
 ensure that any information provided in respect of a product is clear,  
fair and not misleading; and
• 
align our interests with those of our clients.

Delegations of authority
A schedule of matters reserved for approval 
by the Board is reviewed annually and is also 
on our website. The Board has granted 
specific delegated authorities (with financial 
limits approved by the Board) to the Chief 
Executive, the Chief Financial Officer, the 
other Executive Directors and senior 
executives in respect of financial, 
accounting, treasury, regulatory and other 
matters relating to the Group’s business  
and these were reviewed and updated 
during 201 1. 
The delegations of authority are based on 
the Chief Executive’s authority from the 
Board. The delegations cover three levels: 
the Chief Executive’s delegations (level one), 
the delegations of the Chief Executive’s 
direct reports (level two), and the 
delegations of matters to senior executives 
(level three). A list of persons to whom these 
three levels of delegations apply and the 
authority to sub-delegate is set out in  
these delegations. 
During 201 1, the Chief Executive reviewed 
and restructured the management team and  
reporting lines and created a new ExCo, 
consisting of his direct reports, to oversee 
the Group business areas.

and reviewed arrangements for whistleblowing 
should an employee wish to raise concerns, in 
confidence, about any possible improprieties.
Internal audit
The Audit Committee reviewed the status of 
of actions from the external effectiveness 
review of Internal Audit by Deloitte and 
Touche, along with an update on the 
completion of recommendations and 
agreeing the procedure for Internal Audit’s 
involvement in corporate activity, such 
as acquisitions. 
Audit Committee
Membership
Robert Jeens is the Chairman of the Audit 
Committee. The other current members are 
Duncan Ferguson and Tim How. All 
members of the Committee are independent 
and have “recent and relevant financial 
experience” and “financial expertise” as 
recommended by the UK Code and the ASX 
Principles. Robert Jeens has competence in 
accounting and auditing as required by the 
Disclosure and Transparency Rules. The 
details of the Audit Committee members are 
set out on pages 24 and 25. The Audit 
Committee met five times in 201 1, all of 
which were scheduled meetings. 
Responsibilities
The Audit Committee is responsible for 
overseeing the reliability and 
appropriateness of the Group’s financial 
reporting, overseeing the effectiveness of 
the Group’s system of internal controls, 
assessing the effectiveness of the Internal 
Audit function, reviewing the performance 
and independence of the external auditors 
(as well as being responsible for 
recommending their appointment, 
reappointment and removal) and reviewing 
the Group’s arrangements in respect of 
whistleblowing. However, ultimate 
responsibility for reviewing and approving 
the Annual Report and Accounts and other 
public reports, declarations and statements 
remains with the Board. A description of 
how the Audit Committee spent its time 
discharging its responsibilities during 201 1 
is set out below.
Audit Committee’s principal activities 
during 2011 
Reliability and appropriateness of the 
Group’s financial reporting
As part of the oversight of the reliability and 
appropriateness of the Group’s financial 
reporting, the Audit Committee received and 
reviewed reports from management and the 
external auditors relating to the Annual 
Report and Accounts of the Group and the 
Company as well as the Interim Report and 
Accounts, interim management statements, 
related disclosures and the financial reporting 
process. This included the review and 
approval of the timetable and deliverables for 
both the full and half-year reporting. In 
addition, it involved a consideration of the 
consolidated income statement, balance 
sheet, statement of comprehensive income, 
statement of changes in equity and statement 
of cash flows with changes in the status of 
significant financial matters being highlighted.
The Audit Committee also considered and 
approved the methodology for determining 
Henderson AUM, fund flow and average net 
management fee rate disclosures as well as 
corporate tax management and effective tax 
rates for the Group.
As part of the Gartmore acquisition, a paper 
was presented which set out the accounting 
treatment for the Gartmore acquisition, the 
judgements exercised in arriving at the 
treatment and the disclosures required.
Internal controls 
The Audit Committee received an internal 
controls report each quarter which contained 
an update from each of the Internal Audit, 
Legal and Compliance functions.

External auditors and auditor 
independence
The external auditors are Ernst & Young LLP. 
The Audit Committee reviewed and approved 
the external auditors’ remuneration and 
engagement letter and reviewed the 
effectiveness of the external auditors during 
201 1 and agreed that the services provided 
by the external auditors were satisfactory.  
The audit engagement partner and senior 
audit team members are rotated every five 
years and no contractual obligations exist to 
restrict the choice of auditors of the Group 
and the Company.
The Charter of Statutory Auditor 
Independence was also reviewed, which 
requires both the Company and the external 
auditors to take measures to safeguard the 
objectivity and independence of the external 
auditors. The Charter takes into account the 
FRC Guidance on Audit Committees and was 
amended to take into account the changes to 
the Guidance which related to the provision of 
non-audit services. The policy includes those 
services which are deemed to be pre-
approved, those which need prior approval and 
those which are prohibited. These measures 
include a prohibition regarding any non-audit 
services in respect of specific areas (e.g. 
secondments to management positions) or 
which could create a conflict or perceived 
conflict. It also includes information on the 
procedures for the selection, appointment and 
rotation of the external audit engagement 
partner. The Charter is on our website.
The Audit Committee reviewed and 
authorised details of the non-audit services 
provided by the external auditors during the 
year (refer to note 4.2 to the Financial 
Statements for a summary of the fees paid) 
and agreed that the provision of non-audit 
services by the external auditors did not 
compromise their objectivity or independence. 
The Audit Committee considered the risk and 
contingency plan in the event of the 
withdrawal of the external auditors from  
the market. 
The external auditors will be asked to attend 
the Company’s AGM on 2 May 2012 and 
will be available to answer questions from 
shareholders about the conduct of the audit 
and the preparation and content of the 
Independent Auditors’ Report as shown 
on page 50.
The internal and external auditors attended all 
Audit Committee meetings during the year 
and, on one occasion, met the Non-Executive 
Directors without the Executive Directors 
being present.
Outside the framework of formal meetings, 
Robert Jeens meets and has regular contact 
with the Chief Financial Officer, the Head of 
Finance, Head of Internal Audit, Head of 
Compliance and the senior engagement 
partner of our external auditors.

Rupert Pennant-Rea is the Chairman of  
the Nomination Committee. All the other 
Non-Executive Directors are members of 
the Nomination Committee. The Nomination 
Committee met twice in 201 1. 
Responsibilities
The Nomination Committee has 
responsibility for considering the size, 
composition, expertise and experience and 
balance of the Board, and the appointment 
and retirement of Directors and making 
recommendations to the Board on these 
matters. 
Nomination Committee’s principal 
activities during 2011
In 201 1, the Nomination Committee 
instructed an external search consultancy to 
identify suitable candidates for an additional 
Non-Executive Director. A list of proposed 
candidates was provided to the Chairman 
and circulated to all the Directors for 
comment. The Chairman and the Senior 
Independent Director then reviewed the list 
and identified a short list of candidates, 
comprising two women and two men, who 
possessed the necessary technical skills 
and international experience. Following an 
interview process, the Chairman and the 
Senior Independent Director agreed that 
Kevin Dolan was the most suitable 
candidate. The Chief Executive also met 
Kevin Dolan and concurred with the 
Chairman’s and Senior Independent 
Director’s assessments. The Committee 
considered the assessments and then 
recommended to the Board that Kevin 
Dolan be appointed as a Non-Executive 
Director. The Nomination Committee also 
considered the proposed appointments of 
Rupert Pennant-Rea
Chairman 
Nomination Committee
James Darkins and David Jacob. Meetings 
were held with the Chairman and the Senior 
Independent Director, following which a 
recommendation was made to appoint them 
to the Board as Executive Directors.
Induction programmes were arranged and 
held for each of the new Directors appointed 
to the Board in 201 1. For Kevin Dolan in 
particular, this included receiving 
presentations from the business areas and 
meeting key individuals within the Group to

and responsibilities of Directors of 
companies listed on the LSE and ASX.
The Nomination Committee also reviewed 
the mix of diversity, skills and experience on 
the Board and succession planning for both 
the Board and senior executives. 36

Remuneration Committee. The other current 
members are Kevin Dolan and Tim How. 
The  Remuneration Committee met seven 
times in 201 1. 
Responsibilities
The Remuneration Committee has 
responsibility for making recommendations 
to the Board on the Group’s remuneration

the ExCo should be provided with incentives 
to encourage superior performance and 
should, in a fair and responsible manner, be 
rewarded for their individual contributions to 
the success of the Group. The Remuneration 
Committee also agrees, maintains and

Membership
Duncan Ferguson is the Chairman of the 
Board Risk Committee. The other current 
members are Gerald Aherne, Kevin Dolan 
and Robert Jeens. The Board Risk 
Committee met four times in 201 1.
Responsibilities
The Board Risk Committee is responsible 
for overseeing, managing and assessing the 
Group’s key risks through a mixture of 
qualitative guidance and quantifiable limits. 
The Board Risk Committee is forward-
looking and advises the Board on the 
Group’s risk profile and risk appetite in 
setting its future strategy. It also advises the 
Board on the amount of surplus regulatory 
capital that should be held and oversees the 
effectiveness of the risk management 
framework and procedures. Responsibilities 
include the monitoring of both regulatory 
compliance and the principal risks and 
uncertainties relating to the Group. It 
reviews the work and reports prepared by 
the Chief Risk Officer (CRO) and oversees 
the effectiveness of the CRO’s role.
Board Risk Committee’s principal 
activities during 2011
The Board Risk Committee received regular 
risk management reports which addressed 
both significant strategic and operational 
issues which occurred during the year and 
emerging risks. Reports on aggregated 
credit risk were provided to each meeting 
which included matters such as 
counterparty risks and the monitoring of 
credit risks related to countries within the 
eurozone. Updates were also received 
regarding correspondence with the FSA on 
risk related matters. 
Other matters considered included issues 
relating to the derivative risk management 
framework and investment risks, as well as a 
report on information security. An overview 
of the structure and operation of the 
Investment Risk team and, separately, 
the US Risk management process, was 
provided to and considered by the Board 
Risk Committee. The Board Risk Committee 
also approved the updated CRO’s and Risk 
function’s priorities and objectives for 201 1.

Governance
Regular updates regarding the potential 
risks relating to the Gartmore acquisition 
were provided and discussed which included 
potential risks relating to regulatory matters, 
asset retention, human resources, 
management stretch and integration. The 
Board Risk Committee now considers the 
acquisition to be complete and all Gartmore 
business risks are managed through the 
existing business under the usual risk 
management framework.
The Board Risk Committee also reviewed 
and updated the Group’s risk appetite 
statement and recommended its approval to 
the Board. Amendments were made by the 
Board Risk Committee to reflect the 
increased size, complexity and risk profile of 
the Group following the Gartmore 
acquisition. The principal risks to which we 
are exposed are outlined on pages 18 and 
19. Monitoring of the key strategic risks was 
carried out via strategic risk reports which 
were prepared by the CRO and presented to 
both the ExCo and Board Risk Committee.
A reverse stress test was undertaken which 
required the Group to identify explicitly the 
scenarios most likely to render the business 
unviable and then assess them. As part of 
this exercise, an overview of possible 
significant events and mitigating 
management actions were considered. 
Semi-annually, the ICAAP document is 
updated by the Risk function in conjunction 
with the relevant business areas. The Board 
Risk Committee then reviewed and 
recommended its approval to the Board 
following approval by the ExCo.
Further information on the Board Risk 
Committee’s role in monitoring and 
assessing the Group’s management of risk 
is set out in the risk management and 
oversight of internal controls sections below.
Risk management
The Board considers risk assessment and 
the existence of effective controls to be 
fundamental to achieving the Group’s 
corporate objectives within an acceptable 
risk and reward profile. During 201 1 and up 
to 28 February 2012, being the date on 
which the Annual Report and Accounts 
were approved, there has been in place an 
ongoing process for identifying, evaluating, 
managing and mitigating risks within the 
Group’s control which accords with the 
guidance set out in the “Turnbull Report – 
Internal Control: Revised Guidance for 
Directors on the Combined Code – October 
2005”. No significant failings or weaknesses 
were identified during this period by this 
process. A summary of the Group’s risk 
policy can be found on our website and the 
key risks and their mitigation are outlined 
under Risk Management on pages 18  
and 19.
The responsibility for managing risk lies with 
the ExCo. There are also a number of 
management committees chaired by, and 
consisting of, senior managers that have 
responsibility for specific areas of risk. 
These provide a forum for resolving and 
managing risk and regulatory issues. 
Day-to-day responsibility for the 
management of risk is delegated to line 
management who work closely with the Risk 
function to maintain an effective system of 
control and oversight.
Our framework utilises a ‘three lines of 
defence’ approach to managing risk: the first 
line is represented by business management 
managing risk and having in place effective 
controls; the second line comprises an 
independent Risk function which monitors 
the operation of those controls and ensuring 
risks are not overlooked and by the 
Compliance team which monitors regulatory 
risks. The third line is provided by Internal 
Audit, which operates and reports, 
independently of management, to the Audit 
Committee and is responsible for assessing 
the effectiveness of controls and, where 
necessary, making recommendations for 
improvements and monitoring management 
action plans to implement such 
improvements.
Quarterly risk reports are provided to the 
Board Risk Committee which include 
material business risks such as credit, 
market and operational risks and the CRO 
provides regular reports to the Board Risk 
Committee on these topics. The Risk 
function also maintains an incident 
management process and reports regularly 
to the ExCo.
The Board considers the scope of the 
activities of the Board Risk Committee and 
the reporting framework set out above, gives 
it sufficient information upon which to 
assess the effectiveness of the Group’s 
system of internal controls and to assess the 
actual and potential risks facing the Group.
Oversight of internal controls
The Board has overall responsibility for the 
Group’s system of internal controls and for 
reviewing its effectiveness. The system of 
internal controls is designed to manage, 
rather than eliminate, the risk of failure to 
achieve business objectives and can provide 
only reasonable, and not absolute, 
assurance against material misstatement  
or loss.
The effectiveness of the Group’s system of 
internal controls is reviewed at least annually 
by the Board in order to safeguard the 
Group’s assets as well as clients’ and 
shareholders’ interests. For 201 1, this review 
covered all material controls including 
financial, operational, compliance controls 
and risk management systems. As part of its 
review, the Board received assurances from 
the Chief Executive, the Chief Financial 
Officer and the other Executive Directors 
that the statement provided on page 49 is 
founded on a sound system of risk 
management and internal controls and that 
the system is operating effectively in all 
material respects in relation to financial 
reporting risks. In addition, the ExCo 
reported positively to the Board on the 
effectiveness of the Group’s system of 
internal controls and the mitigation of any 
material business risks.
The Board has delegated certain 
responsibilities to the Audit and Board Risk 
Committees (refer to pages 34 and 36 for a 
summary of the responsibilities of these 
Committees). Terms of reference for these 
Committees are available on our website. 
Our system of internal controls requires line 
managers to confirm regularly that controls 
in their respective areas have operated 
effectively. These controls, and the risks 
which they are designed to mitigate, are 
maintained within the Group’s operational 
risk database, which in turn reflects the risk 
profiles of each part of the Group’s business. 
Internal controls over financial 
reporting
Our financial reporting process has been 
designed to provide reasonable assurance 
regarding the reliability of the financial 
reporting and preparation of financial 
statements, including consolidated financial 
statements, for external purposes, in 
accordance with IFRS. This process is under 
the supervision of the Chief Executive and 
the Chief Financial Officer and has 
appropriate internal controls to ensure its 
effectiveness. The internal controls include 
policies and procedures that: 
• 
 relate to the maintenance of records that, 
in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly 
reflect the transactions and disposals of 
the Group’s assets; 
• 
 provide reasonable assurance that  38
Henderson Group 
Annual Report 201 1
transactions are recorded as necessary to 
permit preparation of financial statements, 
and that the receipts and expenditures of 
the Group are being made only in 
accordance with authorisations of 
management and Directors; and 
• 
 provide reasonable assurance regarding 
prevention or timely detection of 
unauthorised acquisition, use or disposal 
of Group assets that could have a material 
effect on the Group’s financial 
statements.
Financial reporting and going concern
The Directors have acknowledged their 
responsibilities in the Directors’ 
Responsibilities Statement in relation to the 
Consolidated Financial Statements for the 
year ended 31 December 201 1 (refer to  
page 49).
Our business activities, together with the 
factors likely to affect its future development, 
performance and position are set out in the 
Chief Executive’s Review on pages 8 to 10. 
The financial position of the Group, and its 
cash flow and liquidity position are described 
in the Consolidated Financial Statements and 
notes. In particular, note 28 to the Financial 
Statements summarises the Group’s 
objectives, policies and processes for 
managing its financial risk management 
objectives, details of financial instruments 
used and hedging activities and its exposures 
to market, liquidity and credit risks.
The Group has sufficient financial resources 
together with diverse revenue streams. As a 
consequence, the Directors believe that the 
Group is well placed to manage its business 
risks successfully.
The Directors closely monitored the material 
uncertainties inherent in current and 
expected market conditions, the trading 
performance of the Group and the debt 
instruments issued by the Group in 2007  
and 201 1. Furthermore, the Directors have 
considered the guidance published by the 
FRC in October 2009 entitled “Going 
Concern and Liquidity Risk: Guidance for 
Directors of UK Companies 2009” and the 
key questions for boards contained within  
that guidance. 
The Directors reviewed the points raised in  
an update published by the FRC in 2012, 
‘Responding to increased country and 
currency risk in financial reports’ and, as a 
result, increased the Group’s disclosure 
regarding foreign currency risk in note 28.4  
to the Financial Statements.
After thorough examination, the Directors are 
satisfied that the Company has and will 
maintain sufficient financial resources to 
enable it to continue operating in the 
foreseeable future, and therefore, continue to 
adopt the going concern basis in preparing 
the Annual Report and Accounts.
Investor relations
We actively engage with investors and 
investor bodies and welcome the 
opportunity to discuss their views on 
relevant issues. The Board also receives 
regular feedback from the Investor Relations 
team and the ExCo about investors’ and 
analysts’ views on the Group and also wider 
industry matters. A monthly report provides 
a summary of our largest shareholders, 
significant movements in the share register 
and reviews share price performance and 
key market and sector developments.
Our website provides online services to help 
shareholders manage their holding and 
engage with the Investor Relations team and 
Share Registry. To assist shareholders in 
accessing up-to-date information on the 
Group, market briefings and other Company 
announcements and presentations are 
available on our website. The Company’s 
Market Disclosure and Communication and 
Shareholder Communication Policies, which

Certain members of the ExCo, in particular 
the Chief Executive and Chief Financial 
Officer, meet with institutional shareholders 
and equity analysts regularly. The largest 
shareholders are offered meetings with 
Non-Executive Directors and the Chairman 
met a number of them during 201 1. 
All shareholders were invited to the General 
Meeting held on 22 March 201 1 where the 
acquisition of Gartmore was approved. Other 
than Gerald Aherne, all Directors were in 
attendance. A Circular and Notice of 
General Meeting (Circular) contained the 
formal notice of meeting and included 
information to assist shareholders in 
understanding the rationale and details of 
the acquisition. Both the Circular and a 
Prospectus relating to the issue of new 
shares in connection with the acquisition are 
on our website. 
All shareholders were invited to the AGM 
held on 4 May 201 1, held in Dublin and 
simultaneously broadcast to a venue in 
Sydney. All Directors attended the AGM. 
Notice of the AGM was given to 
shareholders and a summary of the 
questions asked at the AGM and the 
answers given, together with the results of 
resolutions put to the AGM, is on the Group

Report on Directors’  
Remuneration
Introduction
This Report on Directors’ Remuneration 
(Report) contains the following information:
• 
a description of the membership and  
role of the Group’s Remuneration 
Committee; 
• 
a summary of the remuneration policy of 
the Group including a statement of the 
Group’s policy on Directors’ remuneration; 
• 
details of the terms of the service 
agreements and the remuneration of each 
Director for the preceding financial year; 
• 
details of the share options and awards 
under long-term incentive schemes, held 
by the Directors; and 
• 
details of each Director’s interest  
in shares.
Henderson Group plc is a Jersey 
incorporated company and therefore has no 
statutory requirement to prepare a Report on 
Directors’ Remuneration. Nevertheless, we 
have voluntarily taken into account the 
requirements of the UK Companies Act in 
preparing this Report. The Report also 
meets the requirements of the Listing Rules 
of the UK Listing Authority. It sets out how 
the principles of the UK Corporate 
Governance Code and the ASX Principles 
relating to Directors’ remuneration are 
applied by the Group. In addition, it outlines 
our alignment with the FSA Code on 
Remuneration.
A resolution will be put to the AGM on  
2 May 2012 inviting shareholders to 
consider and vote on this Report.
Role, membership and responsibilities 
of the Remuneration Committee
Role of the Remuneration Committee
The Remuneration Committee reviews and 
approves, where appropriate, the Group’s 
remuneration plans and overall HR policies 
and practices. Its duties are to:
• 
review and recommend to the Board the 
Group’s remuneration protocols and HR 
practices, which are performance based 
and aligned with the Group’s strategy and 
overall business objectives; 
• 
determine annually the remuneration of 
the Chairman, the Chief Executive and  
the ExCo; 
• 
approve the policy and terms of the 
Group’s employee and executive share 
incentive schemes; 
• 
approve the Group’s Remuneration Policy 
Statement and the remuneration terms 
and arrangements for Code Staff in 
accordance with the FSA Code on 
Remuneration; and 
• 
consider pay levels and employment 
conditions for all employees. 
The full terms of reference of the 
Remuneration Committee are available  
on the Group’s website. 
No Director or member of the ExCo is 
involved in any decision on their own 
remuneration.
Membership 
The Remuneration Committee consists 
entirely of independent Non-Executive 
Directors. At the start of 201 1, it consisted  
of Gerald Aherne (Committee Chairman), 
Duncan Ferguson, Tim How and Robert 
Jeens. Kevin Dolan joined the Committee 
with effect from 26 September 201 1. In 
October 201 1, as part of a broader review of 
the Board Committees, the composition of 
the Committee was changed to Gerald 
Aherne (Committee Chairman), Kevin Dolan 
and Tim How.
The Chairman and the Chief Executive may 
attend Committee meetings, save that they 
may not attend if their own remuneration is 
under consideration.
Meetings
The Remuneration Committee meets 
regularly and takes advice on a range of 
matters, including the scale and composition 
of the total remuneration package payable in 
comparable financial institutions to people 
with similar qualifications, skills and 
experience. In 201 1, the Committee 
prepared for the compliance with the FSA 
Code on Remuneration and other regulatory 
developments in remuneration policies  
and practices. 
The Committee is supported by the Chief 
Financial Officer, the General Counsel, the 
Managing Director, Corporate Services and 
the CRO. The Managing Director, Corporate 
Services is invited to attend meetings, 
except when his own remuneration is  
under consideration.
The Remuneration Committee Chairman 
and the Chief Executive make remuneration 
recommendations for the ExCo which 
reports to the Chief Executive. The 
Chairman is also consulted about the 
remuneration of the Executive Directors.
The Remuneration Committee met seven 
times in 201 1.
Advisers
During 201 1, the Remuneration Committee 
received advice from external, specialist 
consultants (Towers Watson, 
PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) and Lane 
Clark & Peacock LLP) on technical aspects 
of remuneration. Towers Watson and PwC 
provided advice on a variety of remuneration 
matters and in particular the FSA Code on 
Remuneration. In addition, McLagan 
Partners also provide remuneration data  
and advice.
None of Towers Watson, Lane Clark & 
Peacock LLP or McLagan Partners has  
any connection with the Group other  
than to provide data and information on 
remuneration and on pension matters  
and developments. PwC provide other 
consultancy or specialist advice and 
services to the Group on an ad hoc basis 
and act as auditors to certain Henderson 
funds but have no other connection with  
the Group.

Policy statement
Remuneration policy
The Committee views a successful 
remuneration policy as one that is 
sufficiently flexible to take account of  
future changes in the Group’s business 
environment and remuneration practice and, 
therefore, the Group’s policy is also subject 
to change.
We have established a remuneration 
framework, which is designed to be market 
competitive and motivate employees to 
improve individual and business 
performance, retain key employees and 
align employee actions with the interests of 
shareholders and clients. Our remuneration 
policies are also designed to address risk 
management and compliance issues. The 
Remuneration Committee has discretion 
and authority to make recommendations  
on matters of remuneration where they 
consider it appropriate to do so especially 
relating to Code Staff. 
Our remuneration framework is based on a 
total reward approach designed to deliver 
top quartile pay for top performance. There 
are three key components:
• 
basic salary – paid within appropriate 
market range; 
• 
annual bonus – paid under a short-term 
incentive plan where individuals have the 
opportunity to receive a bonus (of which a 
substantial portion above a specified 
threshold is deferred over three years) 
based on business and individual 
performance against targets; and
• 
long-term incentive plans – performance-
based for senior executives and certain 
professionals such as senior fund 
managers and key distribution personnel 
which typically vest over five years.
We also considered guidelines from the 
regulators and government on executive pay 
and remuneration and HR practices 
including diversity and gender. As a result, 
the Group has implemented several changes 
that strengthen the link between its 
remuneration policies and HR practice and 
the increased focus on corporate 
remuneration governance, these being:
• 
a Group Remuneration Policy Statement 
that sets out the Group’s remuneration 
policies and practice;
• 
the introduction of risk assessment 
factors into our key reward processes 
through liaison with the CRO, the Board 
Risk Committee and the Remuneration 
Committee when awards are made and 
vest; 
• 
new rules for the Group’s share plans to 
provide the Remuneration Committee 
with the authority to vary or lapse 
individual unvested awards in cases of 
poor risk management or where results 
have been misstated or where there has 
been serious misconduct. The Committee 
also has the ability to claw back shares 
vested under long-term incentives plans 
e.g. in the case of serious personal 
misconduct; and
• 
the introduction of non-financial 
objectives and risk measures into the key 
remuneration policies and the annual 
employee appraisal processes. In 
particular in future the Long-Term 
Incentive Plans (LTIPs) will contain a risk 
and sustainability measure alongside 
relative TSR and processes which will 
enable the Remuneration Committee to 
identify and regularly monitor all Code 
Staff in respect of reward, risk 
management, compulsory deferral and 
annual appraisals.
Total shareholder return performance
The graphs below show the Company’s 
share price performance compared to the 
movement in the FTSE 250 Index and the 
FTSE 350 General Financial Services Index. 
These two indices were selected as the 
most appropriate indices for the Group. The 
share price in 201 1 ranged from a low of 
95.05 pence on 4 October 201 1, a peak of 
173.10 pence on 1 April 201 1 and closed at 
102.40 pence on 31 December 201 1.

Executive Directors’ remuneration: 
individual elements
Overall structure
Executive Directors’ remuneration 
comprises:
• 
basic salary; 
• 
annual bonus; 
• 
pension benefits; 
• 
benefits in kind; and 
• 
participation in certain Group-wide 
incentive schemes, such as LTIP, the 
Restricted Share Plan (RSP), the 
Sharesave scheme (SAYE), the Employee 
Share Ownership Plan (ESOP), the Buy 
As You Earn Share Plan (BAYE) and the 
Deferred Equity Plan (DEP).
The LTIP and the annual bonus are 
performance related and these are key 
elements in the Executive Directors’ 
remuneration packages. The SAYE is 
available to all UK and US employees and  
is not performance related. Awards to 
Executive Directors can be made under the 
RSP and may be subject to performance 
conditions. The ESOP is a performance-
driven voluntary deferral plan available to all 
employees but is not operated every year.
For target levels of performance, at least 
60% of total remuneration (excluding 
pension) should be performance related. 
The expected value of awards made under 
the LTIP was calculated by Towers Watson, 
using a proprietary methodology. Its 
methodology considers TSR rank at which 
payment begins, the payment level at this 
threshold, the maximum payment under the 
plan and the rank at which this maximum is 
achieved. The methodology also takes into 
account the correlation of the Company’s 
share price with those companies in its peer 
group, starting from the premise that the 
value of the shares awarded at the end of 
the performance period is correlated with 
the TSR ranking. The Committee is satisfied 
that the overall structure is a well-
considered set of arrangements for the 
Executive Directors’ remuneration. It is kept 
under review to take account of changing 
circumstances. Incentive payments are not 
taken into account for pension purposes.
Basic salary
Salaries are reviewed annually for each 
Executive Director. In 201 1, the salaries of 
the Chief Executive and the Chief Financial 
Officer remained unchanged at £350,000 
per annum and £300,000 per annum 
respectively. The salaries of the two newly 
appointed Executive Directors’, James 
Darkins and David Jacob were £234,100 
and £250,000 per annum respectively.  41
Henderson Group  
Annual Report 201 1
Governance
Annual bonus
At the discretion of the Committee, each 
Executive Director may receive a cash 
bonus subject to achieving performance 
targets set by the Committee. Payment of 
bonuses (if any) will be made to the 
Executive Directors annually, in February, on 
condition that performance targets were 
met in the preceding calendar year. The 
Committee has the flexibility to take into 
account other factors in determining any 
bonus. The bonus range is zero to a 
specified maximum. The maximum bonus 
entitlement is based on a percentage of 
annual basic salary. The maximum 
entitlements for 201 1 performance were 
600% of salary for the Chief Executive 
(2010: 600%) and 200% of salary for the 
Chief Financial Officer (2010: 200%). The 
maximum bonus entitlement for the 
Managing Director, Property and the 
Managing Director Henderson Investment 
Management and Chief Investment Officer, 
were 300% and 500% respectively. 
Each element of the Executive Directors’ 
reward package supports the achievement 
of key business measures and rewards 
outperformance as illustrated in the  
table below:
Element Structure Purpose Performance measure
Basic salary Fixed Reflects the competitive 
market rate for the role,

Notes 
In 201 1, the Committee agreed to consider, in particular, certain non-financial measures:
• 
potential external and/or reputational issues arising from regulatory issues, including an adverse report from, or financial 
penalty imposed by, the FSA, Securities and Exchange Commission, Monetary Authority of Singapore or other 
regulator, an adverse report from Ernst & Young relating to the Group’s Annual Audit Faculty or reputational risk, other 
than those included above; and 
• 
operational risk and internal controls: the cost of any error deals in the year, together with a failure to satisfactorily close 
actions relating to any incidents; the number of serious issues identified by Internal Audit, combined with a failure to 
close related actions within agreed timescales or non-adherence to internal procedures i.e. Group-wide compulsory 
training (such as TCF and market abuse) or control sign-offs not completed on time.
For the Executive Directors, the corporate 
performance targets relate to Group 
performance measures as set out in the 
table. The Group’s performance measure in 
201 1 was predominantly underlying pre-tax 
profit. However, operating margins, net fund 
flows, return on equity and investment 
performance were also factored in. Also 
considered were a number of non-financial 
measures as set out in the note to the table 
and a report from the CRO on risk 
management. The Committee and the 
Board review the performance of each 
Executive Director on an annual basis 
against these targets and guidance from the 
FSA in its Code of Remuneration. The 
Committee determined that annual bonuses 
for Executive Directors should continue to 
be subject to substantial deferral (which also 
applies to all Code Staff).
Long-term incentives
Under the LTIP, the Committee may make 
awards to Executive Directors up to a 
maximum number of ordinary shares 
determined by the Committee at the date of 
grant. Full vesting of awards is over a three 
to five year period and is conditional upon 
the achievement of a performance target 
measured over a three year period and the 
Executive Director’s continued employment 
during the performance period. The primary 
performance measure is relative TSR 
against a comparator group and the 
Committee must be satisfied that the 
Company’s TSR performance reasonably 
reflects its underlying financial performance 
over the performance period. In addition, the 
Committee has the power to vary or lapse 
individual unvested awards in cases of poor 
risk management or where results have 
been misstated or where there has been 
serious misconduct. The Committee also 
has the ability in certain cases to claw back 
vested awards. 
The Group made awards under the LTIP to 
Andrew Formica, Shirley Garrood, James 
Darkins and David Jacob on 4 May 201 1. 
The aggregate market value of the ordinary 
shares capable of being acquired under 
these awards at the date of award was 
equivalent to 460%, 215%, 206% and 
242% of salary respectively.
The Committee will consider awards under 
the LTIP to the Executive Directors in 2012. 
The Committee also intends to change the 
LTIP performance metrics from 100% 
relative TSR to 95% relative TSR and 5% on 
risk and sustainability metrics. In 
determining the 5%, the Committee will take 
account of the non-financial metrics in the 
annual bonus scheme along with a report 
from the CRO which will cover an 
assessment of risk awareness and culture in 
the Company over the LTIP period. 
2011 LTIP award
The proportion of the 201 1 LTIP awards that 
will vest will be determined by reference to 
the Company’s TSR over the three year 
period commencing 1 January 201 1, 
compared to that achieved over the same 
period by the companies in the FTSE 350 
General Financial Services Index. If the 
Group’s TSR performance is below the 50th 
percentile, none of the shares awarded will 
vest. If the Group’s TSR performance is at 
the 50th percentile, 25% of the shares  
will vest and if it is at or above the 75th 
percentile, 100% of the shares awarded  
will vest. Vesting between these latter  
two points will be calculated on a  
straight-line basis. 
Following changes approved by 
shareholders to the LTIP at the AGM in 
201 1, the 201 1 LTIP award will vest from 
March 2014 to March 2016 with a dividend 
equivalent payment in respect of 201 1 to 
2014 being paid in two equal tranches on 
the first and second anniversary of the date 
of vesting in 2015 and 2016.  42

2010 LTIP award
The awards made in 2010 continue to be 
held, subject to the same TSR performance 
condition as the 201 1 LTIP, over the three 
year period to 31 December 2012. The 
awards will vest in March 2013 subject to 
achievement of performance conditions.
2009 LTIP award
Awards made in 2009 will vest in April 2012. 
Based on a TSR of 107.12% over the three 
years 2009 to 201 1 which ranked the 
Company fifth in the list of comparator 
companies and at the 84th percentile, 
100% of the shares will be capable  
of exercise.
2008 LTIP award
2008 LTIP awards vested in February 201 1. 
Based on a TSR of 38.68% over the prior 
three calendar years which ranked the 
Company eighth in the list of comparator 
companies and at the 79th percentile, 
100% of the shares in the award were 
capable of exercise.
Shareholding requirement
The Committee has also determined that, 
over time, each Executive Director should be 
required to maintain a target shareholding in 
the Company, equivalent to 100% of basic 
salary, in order to align the interests of 
Executive Directors more closely with those 
of shareholders. Each of the Executive 
Directors met this requirement in 201 1. 
All-employee Group share schemes
The SAYE, a savings related share option 
scheme, is available to all UK employees. It 
operates within specific UK tax legislation 
(including a requirement to finance exercise 
of the option using the proceeds of a 
monthly savings contract) and exercise of 
the option is not subject to satisfaction of a 
performance target since this is an 
all-employee scheme. Executive Directors 
are eligible to participate in the SAYE on the 
same terms as other employees. There is a 
similar plan for US employees.
The BAYE, available to all UK employees, is 
a scheme that operates within specific UK 
tax legislation. The BAYE represents a 
further opportunity for employees to 
increase their share ownership in the 
Company, which is an important tool in 
attracting and retaining staff in the asset 
management industry. The BAYE enables 
participants to acquire shares via deductions 
from gross salary, for which the Company 
provides two free matching shares for every 
one purchased. The BAYE also allows for 
limited annual awards of free shares up to 
HM Revenue & Customs (HMRC) (UK tax 
authority) limits. Executive Directors are 
eligible to participate in the BAYE. There are 
similar plans for employees outside the UK 
(except for China and India).
The ESOP, offered in February 201 1, 
provided an opportunity for eligible 
employees to increase their ownership in the 
Group. Employees were able to purchase 
Company shares up to a set limit through 
the DEP and, subject to achievement of 
prescribed TSR and Company share price 
performance hurdles and continued 
employment over a specified period, the 
Company will provide matching shares for 
each share purchased. The Company does 
not intend to offer the plan in 2012. 
Where employees are subject to the 
mandatory deferral of a portion of their 
annual bonus, the deferred amount is used 
to purchase the Company’s shares or 
products in the DEP. The deferred shares/
products are held in trust during the deferral 
period, three years, and are subject to 
forfeiture conditions. 
The Company Share Option Plan (CSOP) is 
a global plan that provides employees with 
an opportunity to buy shares after three 
years at an option price fixed at the start of 
the scheme. Under the CSOP, an employee 
may receive one or several awards of stock 
options. As a global plan, the tax treatment 
for this plan can vary by country and tax 
jurisdiction but in the UK an employee’s 
CSOP is limited to £30,000 in aggregate of 
all unexercised options. Executive Directors 
are not eligible to participate in the CSOP, 
but can retain any awards made before  
their appointment.
The Executive Shared Ownership Plan 
(ExSOP) encourages employee share 
ownership at middle management level. 
Under the ExSOP, selected employees are 
invited to acquire, jointly with an employee 
benefit trust (Co-Owner) and upon the terms 
of a joint ownership agreement, a restricted 
beneficial interest in a given number of 
shares in the Company. When the jointly 
owned shares are sold, after at least three 
years, the participant receives the growth in 
the value of the shares and the Co-Owner 
retains the original value of the shares. 
Executive Directors are excluded from 
participating in the ExSOP. 
All Group share awards can be funded by 
share issuance except for an element of  
the BAYE and DEP which is made through 
on-market purchases. All awards to 
Executive Directors are satisfied by 
on-market purchases.
The Group’s share plans rules currently 
restrict the level of shares that may be 
issued to satisfy share plan vestings to 10% 
of the issued share capital of the Group over 
a 10 year rolling period. Executive plans are 
restricted to 5%. At the 201 1 AGM, 
shareholders approved that up to 16m 
matching shares from the ESOP would not 
count toward the calculation of this  
dilution limit.
Pensions
Retirement benefits are designed to be both 
market competitive and cost effective. HGI 
Group Limited is the sponsoring employer  
of HGPS, which has both a defined benefit 
section (closed to new members) and a 
defined contribution section. No active 
members of the defined benefit section of 
HGPS receive unapproved pension benefits 
in addition to their normal scheme benefits. 
In the UK scheme, the Group replaced the 
statutory earnings cap which was abolished 
on 6 April 2006 by the Finance Act 2004 
with an internal scheme earnings cap, which 
is broadly the same as the previous statutory 
figure adjusted for inflation. The annual 
scheme earnings cap in 201 1 was £128,412 
(2010: £122,760).
The Executive Directors participate in the 
non-contributory section of HGPS providing 
benefits on a defined contribution basis on 
the same age related basis as other 
employees. The Chief Executive receives a 
Group contribution, currently 10.5% of basic 
salary, into the pension plan limited by the 
operation of the scheme earnings cap and 
the Chief Financial Officer, the Managing 
Director, Property and the Managing 
Director, Henderson Investment 
Management and Chief Investment Officer, 
each receive 1 1.5%, again limited by the 
operation of the scheme earnings cap. 
In 2007, the Group introduced a Self 
Invested Personal Pension (SIPP) that 
allowed UK employees to make voluntary 
contributions into a wide range of funds as 
well as giving them the ability to transfer 
Company shares from maturing share  
plans into the SIPP in a tax effective 
manner. The Group rebates some of the 
national insurance savings to employees’  
SIPP accounts. 
The Group also has pension arrangements 
in place for its non-UK-based employees, 
which are in line with local market practice. 43

Benefits and benefits in kind
The Executive Directors are contractually 
entitled to a lump-sum life assurance benefit 
of four times basic salary and private 
healthcare medical insurance. In addition, 
the Chief Executive and Chief Financial 
Officer are entitled to permanent  
health insurance.
The Executive Directors also benefit from 
indemnity arrangements in respect of their 
services as Directors, and Directors’ and 
Officers’ liability insurance, under separate 
Deeds of Indemnity. Further details can be 
found in the Directors’ Report. 
Contracts and termination provisions
The Group’s policy is to employ Executive 
Directors on annual rolling contracts 
although, in exceptional circumstances  
on recruitment, longer initial terms may  
be approved by the Committee. To date,  
it has not exercised this power. The 
Committee will, consistent with the best 
interests of the Group, seek to minimise 
termination payments.
The Executive Directors have service 
agreements terminable on not less than 12 
months’ written notice by the Group or on 
not less than six months’ written notice by 
the relevant Executive Director.
The service agreements allow the Group to 
suspend the Executive Directors from their 
duties at any time after notice has been 
given by either party, provided they continue 
to receive full pay. Under certain 
circumstances (such as serious misconduct), 
the Group may terminate employment 
immediately with no liability to make any 
further payment (other than amounts 
accrued to the date of termination).
The Executive Directors’ service 
agreements have no provisions for 
remuneration payable on early termination.  
In relation to their participation in long-term 
incentive related pay, Executive Directors 
are subject to the same LTIP rules as  
other participants. 
Toby Hiscock, former Chief Financial Officer, 
received 208,333 shares in February 201 1 
in respect of a prorated award from the 
2008 LTIP as part of his contractual 
post-termination arrangements and his 
adherence to restrictions post-termination 
agreed at the time of his departure from the 
Group in 2009. No further awards are due.
Chairman and other  
Non-Executive Directors
The remuneration of the Chairman is 
determined by the Chairman of the 
Remuneration Committee and the other 
Non-Executive Directors and, for other 
Non-Executive Directors, is determined by 
the Chairman and the Executive Directors, 
both on the basis of external independent 
advice. The Chairman and other Non-
Executive Directors serve the Company 
under letters of appointment that are 
terminable by the Company on one month’s 
written notice without liability for 
remuneration; they do not have service 
agreements. It is the Company’s policy that 
the Chairman and other Non-Executive 
Directors do not participate in any of the 
Group’s bonus, incentive or pension 
schemes, nor are they entitled to any 
retirement benefits. Under their respective 
letters of appointment:
• 
the annual fee payable to each Non-
Executive Director (other than the 
Chairman and the Audit, Remuneration 
and Board Risk Committee Chairmen) is 
£55,000, of which £5,000 is paid in the 
form of Company shares; 
• 
the annual additional fee payable to the 
Audit, Remuneration and Board Risk 
Committee Chairmen is £20,000, of 
which £5,000 is paid in the form of 
Company shares; 
• 
Rupert Pennant-Rea is Non-Executive 
Chairman of the Group. His fees are 
£180,000 per annum, of which £20,000 
is paid in the form of Company shares; 
and
• 
Tim How, the Senior Independent 
Director, is entitled to additional fees of 
£5,000 per annum.
The Chairman, together with the Executive 
Directors, has reviewed the basic fees paid 
to other Non-Executive Directors and 
determined that they would rise by £5,000 
to £60,000 per annum with effect from  
1 January 2012. The fees will next be 
reviewed in 2013. The additional fees for the 
Senior Independent Director will also 
increase by £5,000 to £10,000 per annum 
with effect from 1 January 2012. The 
additional fees for the Audit, Remuneration 
and Board Risk Committee Chairmen will 
remain unchanged. 
The Chairman of the Remuneration 
Committee and the other Non-Executive 
Directors (excluding the Chairman) also 
reviewed the fees payable to the Chairman 
and determined that they would remain 
unchanged at £180,000 per annum.

Notes
• 
  Annual bonus awards paid to the Executive Directors are subject to the same Company mandatory deferral terms that apply to other employees.  In respect of the Executive Directors, 
this is approximately 40% of the annual bonus award and performance fee award. The annual bonus shown above is the amount before deferral. The annual bonus and performance 
fee awards for James Darkins and David Jacob are prorated annual amounts to reflect their period of Executive Director office.
• 
There were no amounts paid to the Executive Directors in respect of their qualifying services by way of expenses allowance that was chargeable to UK income tax.
• 
 Remuneration of Executive Directors is for the calendar year 201 1 or from date of appointment if after 1 January. James Darkins’ and David Jacob’s remuneration reflects their 
remuneration from their date of appointment, 4 May 201 1. 
• 
 The non-cash elements of the Executive Directors’ remuneration packages (disclosed in the table above as Benefits in kind) consist of the provision of life assurance and private 
medical insurance based on the taxable value for the 2010/201 1 tax year.
• 
The payment under Other in the table above relates to pension contribution including any employer contribution in respect of a SIPP.
• 
The Share Plan vesting figures in the table above relate to the 2008 Sharesave scheme, the second tranche of the Chief Executive 2008 RSP award, the vesting of mandatory (DEP) 
and voluntary (ESOP) deferred matching shares and the gross value of dividends paid on company share plans eligible for dividend payment. The figures for Andrew Formica and 
Shirley Garrood exclude the 2008 LTIP vesting because they have not exercised the vested award. In respect of James Darkins and David Jacob, the 2008 LTIP vested prior to their 
Executive Director appointment. David Jacob’s award vested automatically. James Darkins has not exercised the vested award. 
• 
  Remuneration of Non-Executive Directors is for the calendar year 201 1 or from date of appointment if after 1 January. Kevin Dolan’s remuneration reflects his remuneration from his 
date of appointment, 26 September 201 1. It also includes £22,153 paid by way of consultancy fees for the period from 1 May 201 1 to 25 September 201 1.

Notes
• 
 Under the SAYE, after 36 monthly contributions of up to £250, SAYE participants may exercise their options to acquire Company shares at a pre-defined issue price set at a 20% 
discount to the closing mid-market value on a pre-defined date. The vested SAYE relates to the 2008 SAYE.
• 
The 2008 LTIP vested in February 201 1. The awards for Andrew Formica (175,000) and Shirley Garrood (175,000) vested but were not exercised and remain under trust. The award for 
James Darkins (175,000) vested prior to his appointment as an Executive Director but was not exercised and remains in trust. The award for David Jacob (175,000 shares) vested 
automatically prior to his appointment as an Executive Director. 
• 
Maximum LTIP award – this number reflects the number of shares that could vest in the future plus awards that have vested but have not been exercised. However, the expected level  
of achievement of the TSR performance target at the time of award is 40.6% of the maximum award. 
• 
The CSOP awards to Shirley Garrood, James Darkins and David Jacob were in respect of previous roles prior to their appointment as Executive Directors.
FSA Code on Remuneration 
The FSA implemented its new Code on Remuneration (Code) with effect from 1 January 201 1. 
Under the Code, the Remuneration Committee must report annually on the remuneration policy and practice for employees termed Code 
Staff. Code Staff are “employees who perform a significant influence function, senior management and risk takers whose professional 
activities could have a material impact on a firm’s risk profile”. 
Code Staff are defined with reference to managerial responsibility to influence the firm’s overall risk profile. At the discretion of the Committee, 
other employees may be included as Code Staff if they consider that their role has a material impact on the firm’s risk profile. An annual review 
of the firm’s risk profile is conducted in order to allow the Remuneration Committee to determine the Code Staff population and a record is 
kept by HR. The Committee also takes advice from the CRO and Chairman of the Board Risk Committee.
Henderson Group’s Code Staff are defined as the Executive Directors, other members of the ExCo and other employees performing FSA 
Significant Influence Functions (SIFs).  48
Henderson Group  
Annual Report 201 1
As at 31 December 201 1, 20 employees were identified as being Code Staff whose roles are:
• 
 Executive Directors (Chief Executive, Chief Financial Officer, Managing Director, Property and Managing Director, Henderson Investment 
Management and Chief Investment Officer);
• 
ExCo members (Managing Director, Corporate Services and Chief Risk Officer); and
• 
SIFs (General Counsel, Chief Operating Officer, Managing Director and Chief Investment Officer, Property, Managing Director, Private 
Equity and the Heads of Equities, Fixed Income, Distribution, Internal Audit, Compliance, Asia, North America and Group Finance).
The aggregate annual remuneration of the Code Staff in respect of 201 1 was £20.2m. This is made up of fixed pay, variable pay,  
non-contributory pension and benefits in kind and share plan related remuneration. 
The structure of the remuneration packages for Code Staff is designed to support the achievement of the same key measures as for 
Executive Directors (as set out on page 41) and to ensure that Code Staff pay complies with the Board’s remuneration policy (as described on 
pages 39 and 40).
The chart below gives more detail on the aggregate remuneration. Fixed pay comprises annual basic salary and car allowance. Variable pay 
comprises discretionary gross annual bonus, performance fees, transaction fees and project bonuses. Pension and benefits comprises 
company employer pension contribution and benefits in kind. Shares comprise the gross gain (before tax and social security) on executive and 
employee share plans awarded in previous years that vested and were exercised in 201 1 and in addition, the value of dividends paid on share 
plans whilst under trust. A fuller description of annual remuneration is shown on pages 41 and 42.

In line with the Company’s mandatory deferral policy approximately one third of the aggregate short-term incentive awards i.e. annual bonus 
awards and performance fee awards, is deferred for three years. Henderson’s Group’s deferral policy on short and long-term incentives fully 
complies with the requirements for Tier four firms as set out in the Code.
Executive long-term incentive awards in the form of shares and options made to Code Staff in 201 1 totalled £2.9m. This represents the 
expected value of awards at vesting, over the next three to five years, dependent upon the achievement of performance hurdles. 
Code Staff can elect within the scheme rules to defer the exercise of executive share plan awards once they have vested. This means that the 
share related element of their aggregate remuneration could vary year by year.
The Report on Directors’ Remuneration sets out the Remuneration Committee’s responsibilities and our remuneration policy in respect of  
Code Staff. 
Additionally, the remuneration of the CRO and the Head of Internal Audit is determined by the Chairman of the Board Risk and  
Audit Committees respectively. These Committees also review and oversee remuneration paid to other senior employees in risk  
and assurance functions.

Governance
The Directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report and Accounts. The Directors are required to prepare financial statements in 
accordance with Jersey law which show a true and fair view in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. The Directors have 
elected to prepare the Group and Company financial statements in accordance with IFRS.
IAS 1 Presentation of Financial Statements requires that financial statements present fairly for each financial year the Group’s and Company’s 
financial position, financial performance and cash flows. In preparing the Group and Company financial statements, the Directors are also 
required to:
• 
select suitable accounting policies in accordance with IAS 8 Accounting Policies, Changes in Accounting Estimates and Errors and then 
apply them consistently;
• 
present information, including accounting policies, in a manner that provides relevant, reliable, comparable and understandable information;
• 
provide additional disclosures when compliance with the specific requirements of IFRS is insufficient to enable users to understand  
the impact of particular transactions, other events and conditions on the Group’s and Company’s financial position and financial 
performance; and
• 
state that the Group and Company have complied with IFRS, subject to any material departures disclosed and explained in the  
financial statements.
The Directors are responsible for keeping proper accounting records which disclose with reasonable accuracy, at any time, the  
financial position of the Group, for safeguarding the assets, and for taking reasonable steps for the prevention and detection of fraud  
and other irregularities.
The Directors confirm that to the best of their knowledge:
• 
the financial statements have been prepared in accordance with IFRS and give a true and fair view of the assets, liabilities, financial position 
and profit or loss of the Group and Company for the year ended 31 December 201 1;
• 
the Directors’ Report includes a fair review of the development and performance of the business and the position of the Group for the year 
ended 31 December 201 1 and a description of the principal risks and uncertainties faced by the Group; and
• 
the accounting records have been properly maintained.

Annual Report 201 1
Independent Auditors’ Report 
to the members of Henderson Group plc 
We have audited the Consolidated and Company financial statements of Henderson Group plc for the year ended 31 December 201 1,  
which comprise the Consolidated Income Statement, the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income, the Consolidated Statement of 
Financial Position, the Consolidated Statement of Changes in Equity, the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows (the Group), the Company 
Income Statement, the Company Statement of Comprehensive Income, the Company Statement of Financial Position, the Company 
Statement of Changes in Equity, the Company Statement of Cash Flows and the related notes 1 to 35 (the financial statements).  
The financial reporting framework that has been applied in their preparation is applicable law and International Financial Reporting  
Standards (IFRS) as adopted by the European Union. 
This report is made solely to the Company’s members, as a body, in accordance with Article 1 13A of the Companies (Jersey) Law 1991.  
Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might state to the Company’s members those matters we are required to state to them in  
an auditors’ report and for no other purpose. To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility to anyone  
other than the Company and the Company’s members as a body, for our audit work, for this report, or for the opinions we have formed.
Respective responsibilities of directors and auditors
As explained more fully in the Directors’ Responsibilities Statement set out on page 49, the Directors are responsible for the preparation of  
the financial statements and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view. Our responsibility is to audit and express an opinion on the 
financial statements in accordance with applicable law and International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland). Those standards require us 
to comply with the Auditing Practices Board’s Ethical Standards for Auditors.
Scope of the audit of the financial statements
An audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements sufficient to give reasonable assurance 
that the financial statements are free from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or error. This includes an assessment of: whether 
the accounting policies are appropriate to the Group and Company’s circumstances and have been consistently applied and adequately 
disclosed; the reasonableness of significant accounting estimates made by the Directors; and the overall presentation of the financial 
statements. In addition, we read all the financial and non-financial information in the annual report to identify material inconsistencies with  
the audited financial statements. If we become aware of any apparent material misstatements or inconsistencies we consider the implications 
for our report.
Opinion on financial statements
In our opinion the financial statements:
• 
give a true and fair view of the state of the Group’s and of the Company’s affairs as at 31 December 201 1 and of the Group’s profit and the 
Company’s loss for the year then ended; 
• 
have been properly prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the European Union; and
• 
have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies (Jersey) Law 1991.
Matters on which we are required to report by exception
We have nothing to report in respect of the following:
Under the Companies (Jersey) Law 1991 we are required to report to you if, in our opinion:
• 
proper accounting records have not been kept, or proper returns adequate for our audit have not been received from branches not visited by 
us; or
• 
the financial statements are not in agreement with the accounting records and returns; or
• 
we have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit.
Under the Listing Rules we are required to review:
• 
the part of the Corporate Governance Statement relating to the Company’s compliance with the nine provisions of the UK Corporate 
Governance Code for our review.

Notes to the Financial Statements  
Group and Company
1.  Authorisation of financial 
statements and statement of 
compliance with IFRS
The Group and Company financial 
statements for the year ended 31 December 
201 1 were authorised for issue by the Board 
of Directors on 28 February 2012 and the 
respective Statements of Financial Position 
were signed on the Board’s behalf by the 
Chairman, Rupert Pennant-Rea. Henderson 
Group plc is a public limited company 
incorporated in Jersey and tax resident in 
the Republic of Ireland. The Company’s 
ordinary shares are traded on the LSE and 
CDIs are traded on the ASX. 
The Group and Company financial 
statements have been prepared in 
accordance with IFRS and the provisions of 
the Companies (Jersey) Law 1991. 
The significant accounting policies adopted 
by the Group and by the Company are set 
out in note 2.1.
2. Accounting policies 
2.1 Significant accounting policies
Basis of preparation
The Group and Company financial 
statements have been prepared on a going 
concern basis and on the historical cost 
basis, except for certain financial 
instruments that have been measured  
at fair value. 
The Group and Company financial 
statements are presented in GBP and  
all values are rounded to the nearest one 
hundred thousand pounds (£0.1m),  
except when otherwise indicated.
Basis of consolidation
The consolidated financial statements of the 
Group comprise the financial statements of 
Henderson Group plc and its subsidiaries as 
at 31 December each year. 
The financial statements of all the Group’s 
significant subsidiaries are prepared to the 
same year end date as that of the Company. 
The accounts of all material subsidiaries are 
prepared under either IFRS or UK GAAP. 
Where prepared under UK GAAP, balances 
reported by subsidiaries are adjusted to 
meet IFRS requirements for the purpose of 
the consolidated financial statements.
The results of subsidiaries acquired or 
disposed of during the year are included in 
the Consolidated Income Statement from 
the effective date of acquisition, being the 
date on which the Group obtains control, 
and continue to be consolidated until the 
date that the control ceases. Non-controlling 
interests represent the equity interests in 
subsidiaries not wholly held by the Group.
Interests in property closed-ended funds, 
private equity infrastructure funds, Open-
Ended Investment Companies (OEICs) and 
unit trusts are accounted for as subsidiaries, 
associates, joint ventures or other financial 
investments depending on the holdings of 
the Group and on the level of influence and 
control that the Group exercises. The 
Group’s investment in associates, where the 
Group has the ability to exercise significant 
influence as well as joint ventures where 
there is joint control, are accounted for using 
the equity method of accounting.
Income recognition
Fee income and commission receivable
Fee income includes management fees, 
transaction fees and performance fees 
(including earned carried interest). 
Management fees and transaction fees are 
recognised in the accounting period in which 
the associated investment management or 
transaction services are provided. 
Performance fees are recognised when the 
prescribed performance hurdles have been 
achieved and it is probable that the fee will 
crystallise as a result. The Group accrues 
95% of the expected fee on satisfaction 
that the recognition criteria have established 
a performance fee is due, with the balance 
recognised on cash settlement. Initial fees 
and commission receivable are deferred and 
amortised over the anticipated period in 
which services will be provided, determined 
by reference to the average term of 
investment in each product on which initial 
fees and commissions are earned. Other 
income is recognised in the accounting 
period in which services are rendered.
Carried interest
The Group is entitled to receive a share of 
profits (carried interest) from certain private 
equity funds it manages, once the funds 
meet certain performance conditions. 
Where the funds’ investments constitute 
large volumes in relatively illiquid markets, 
the Group does not deem it appropriate to 
recognise unearned carried interest based 
on current fair values. However, where the 
value of the carried interest will be 
determined by the future disposal of 
investments which are quoted on a 
recognised exchange, then the Group will 
recognise carried interest to the extent 
deemed prudent. Carried interest for all 
other types of investments is only 
recognised when investments are disposed 
of and performance conditions are met.
Finance income
Interest income is recognised as it accrues 
using the effective interest rate method. 
Dividend income from investments is 
recognised on the date that the right to 
receive payment has been established.
Realised and unrealised gains and losses 
on financial assets
See the policy set out under financial 
instruments on page 61.
Operating leases
All leases are classified as operating leases. 
Operating lease payments are recognised 
as an expense in the Consolidated Income 
Statement on a straight-line basis over the 
lease term. Benefits received and receivable 
as an incentive to enter into an operating 
lease are also spread on a straight-line basis 
over the lease term.
Post-employment benefits
The Group provides employees with 
retirement benefits through both defined 
benefit and defined contribution schemes. 
The assets of these schemes are held 
separately from the Group’s general assets 
in trustee administered funds. 
Defined benefit obligations and the cost of 
providing benefits are determined annually 
by independent qualified actuaries using the 
projected unit credit method. The obligation 
is measured as the present value of the 
estimated future cash outflows using a 
discount rate based on AA rated corporate 
bond yields of appropriate duration. The 
resulting surplus or deficit of defined benefit 
assets less liabilities is recognised in the 
Consolidated Statement of Financial 
Position, net of any taxes that would be 
deducted at source. The Group’s expense 
related to these schemes is accrued over 
the employees’ service lives, based upon the 
actuarial cost for the accounting period, 
having considered interest costs and the 
expected return on assets. Actuarial gains 
and losses, to the extent these are 
recognised, are included in the Consolidated 
Statement of Comprehensive Income in the 
accounting period in which they occur, net of 
any taxes that would be deducted at source. 
Normal contributions to the defined 
contribution scheme are expensed in the 
Consolidated Income Statement as they 
become payable in accordance with the 
rules of the scheme.
Other post-employment benefits, such as 
medical care and life insurance, are also 
provided for certain employees. The costs  
of such benefits are accrued over the 
employees’ service lives, based upon the 
actuarial cost for the accounting period 
using a methodology similar to that for 
defined benefit pension schemes. 60

Annual Report 201 1
2. Accounting policies continued
Share-based payment transactions
The Group issues equity-settled and 
cash-settled share-based payments to 
certain employees. The valuation 
methodology, assumptions and schemes  
are disclosed in note 10.
Equity-settled share-based payments are 
measured at the fair value of the equity 
instruments at the grant date. The awards 
are expensed, with a corresponding 
increase in reserves, on either a straight-
line basis or a graded basis (depending on 
vesting conditions) over the vesting period, 
based on the Group’s estimate of shares 
that will eventually vest. Based on the 
Group’s estimate, the expected life of the 
awards used in the determination of fair 
value is adjusted for the effects of 
non-transferability, exercise restrictions, 
market performance and behavioural 
considerations.
The cost of cash-settled transactions is 
measured initially at fair value at the grant 
date. The fair value is expensed over the 
period until vesting, with recognition of a 
corresponding liability. The liability is 
remeasured at each reporting date up to 
and including the settlement date, with 
changes in fair value recognised in the 
Consolidated Income Statement.
Income taxes
The Group provides for current tax expense 
according to the tax laws of each jurisdiction in 
which it operates, using tax rates that have 
been enacted or substantively enacted by the 
reporting date.
Deferred tax is provided, using the liability 
method, on temporary differences at the 
reporting date between the tax bases of 
assets and liabilities and their carrying 
amounts for financial reporting purposes. 
Deferred tax liabilities are generally 
recognised for all taxable temporary 
differences and deferred tax assets are 
recognised to the extent that it is probable 
that taxable profits will be available against 
which deductible temporary differences can 
be utilised. Deferred tax assets or liabilities 
are not recognised if they arise from 
goodwill, however, they are recognised on 
separately identified intangible assets. If the 
deferred tax arises from the initial 
recognition of an asset or liability in a 
transaction, other than a business 
combination, that at the time of the 
transaction affects neither the accounting 
nor taxable profit or loss, it is not accounted 
for. The carrying amount of deferred tax 
assets is reviewed at each reporting date 
and reduced to the extent that it is no longer 
probable that sufficient taxable profits will 
be available to allow all or part of the asset 
to be recovered.
Deferred tax liabilities are not recognised for 
taxable differences arising on investments 
in subsidiaries, branches, associates and 
joint ventures where the Group controls the 
timing of the reversal of the temporary 
differences and where the reversal of the 
temporary differences is not anticipated in 
the foreseeable future. 
Deferred tax is calculated at the tax rates 
that are expected to apply in the period 
when the liability is settled or the asset is 
realised, based on tax rates and tax laws 
that have been enacted or substantively 
enacted by the reporting date.
Income tax relating to items recognised in 
the Consolidated Statement of 
Comprehensive Income is also recognised in 
that statement and not in the Consolidated 
Income Statement. 
Sales taxes
Expenses and assets are recognised net of 
the amount of sales tax, except where the 
sales tax is not recoverable, in which case 
the sales tax is recognised as part of the 
cost of acquisition of the asset or as part of 
expenses. Receivables and payables are 
stated with the amount of sales tax included. 
The net amount of sales tax recoverable 
from, or payable, to the tax authority, 
is included separately in receivables or 
payables in the Consolidated Statement 
of Financial Position.
Business combinations
Under the requirements of IFRS 3 Business 
Combinations, all business combinations are 
accounted for using the purchase method 
(acquisition accounting). The cost of a 
business combination is the aggregate of 
the fair values, at the date of exchange, of 
assets given, liabilities incurred or assumed 
and equity instruments issued by the 
acquirer. The fair value of a business 
combination is calculated at the acquisition 
date by recognising the acquiree’s 
identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent 
liabilities that satisfy the recognition criteria, 
at their fair values at that date. The 
acquisition date is the date on which the 
acquirer effectively obtains control of the 
acquiree. The cost of a business 
combination in excess of fair value of net 
identifiable assets or liabilities acquired, 
including intangible assets identified, is 
recognised as goodwill. Any costs incurred 
in relation to a business combination after 1 
July 2009 are expensed when the services 
are received.
Goodwill
Goodwill arising on acquisitions is 
capitalised in the Consolidated Statement of 
Financial Position. Goodwill on acquisitions 
prior to 1 January 2004 is carried at its 
value on 1 January 2004 less any 
subsequent impairments. 
Goodwill arising on investments in associates 
and joint ventures is included within the 
carrying value of the equity accounted 
investments.
Impairment of goodwill
Goodwill is reviewed for impairment annually 
or more frequently if changes in 
circumstances indicate that the carrying 
value may be impaired. For this purpose, 
management prepares a valuation for each 
cash generating unit based on value in use. 
This valuation is based on the approved 
forecasts for future years, extrapolated for 
expected future growth rates and 
discounted at a risk adjusted discount rate 
based on the Group’s post-tax weighted 
average cost of capital. Where the value in 
use is less than the carrying amount, an 
impairment is recognised. Where goodwill 
forms part of an entity or sub-group and the 
entity or sub-group or part thereof is 
disposed of, the goodwill associated with the 
entity or sub-group disposed of is included 
in the carrying amount of the operation 
when determining the gain or loss on 
disposal. Any impairment is recognised 
immediately through the Consolidated 
Income Statement and cannot subsequently 
be reversed.
Investment management contracts
Investment management contracts have 
been identified as a separately identifiable 
intangible asset arising on the acquisition of 
subsidiaries. Intangible assets are 
recognised at the present value of the 
expected future cash flows of the 
investment management contracts acquired. 
The intangible asset is amortised on a 
straight-line basis over the expected life of 
the investment management contracts, 
currently estimated at between three and 
eight years. 
Computer software
The costs of purchasing and developing 
computer software, together with associated 
relevant expenditure, are capitalised where it 
is probable that future economic benefits 
that are attributable to the assets will flow to 
the Group and the cost of the assets can be 
measured reliably. Computer software is 
included in the Consolidated Statement of 
Financial Position as an intangible asset and 
is recorded initially at cost and then 
amortised over its expected useful life, of 
between three and five years, on a 
straight-line basis. 
Notes to the Financial Statements  
Group and Company continued 61
Henderson Group  
Annual Report 201 1
Financials
Plant and equipment
Plant and equipment is valued at cost and 
depreciated on a straight-line basis over its 
useful economic life of between two and  
20 years.
An item of plant and equipment is removed 
upon disposal or when no future economic 
benefits are expected to arise from the 
continued use of the asset. Any gain or loss 
arising on the disposal of the asset, 
calculated as the difference between the 
net disposal proceeds and the carrying 
amount of the asset, is included in the 
Consolidated Income Statement in the year 
the item is sold or retired.
Investments in subsidiaries
Investments by the Company in subsidiary 
undertakings are held at cost less any 
impairment where circumstances indicate 
that the carrying value may not be 
recoverable.
Equity accounted investments
Equity accounted investments comprise 
investments in associates and joint ventures 
held by the Group. Investments are recognised 
initially at cost. The investments are 
subsequently carried at cost adjusted for the 
Group’s share of profits or losses and other 
changes in comprehensive income of the 
associate or joint venture, less any dividends or 
distributions received by the Group. The 
Consolidated Income Statement includes the 
Group’s share of profits or losses for the year 
or period of ownership, if shorter. 
Deferred acquisition and  
commission costs
Incremental acquisition costs incurred in 
obtaining investment management business 
are deferred to the extent that they are 
recoverable out of future income. This 
includes initial commission paid by the 
Group in respect of certain investment 
products. These costs are amortised over 
the period in which they are expected to be 
recovered from matching revenues from 
related contracts. At the end of each 
accounting period, deferred acquisition and 
commission costs are reviewed for 
recoverability against future revenues from 
the related contracts in force at the 
reporting date.
Placement fees are deferred and amortised 
over the expected investment period of the 
fund. Where the actual investment period is 
significantly shorter than expected, the 
amortisation rate is accelerated accordingly.
Impairment of assets (excluding 
goodwill and financial assets)
At each reporting date, the Group assesses 
whether there is any indication that an asset 
may be impaired. Where an indicator of 
impairment exists, the Group makes an 
estimate of the recoverable amount, being the 
higher of an asset’s fair value less cost to sell, 
and its value in use. In assessing value in use, 
the estimated future cash flows are 
discounted to their net present value using a 
risk adjusted discount rate based on the 
Group’s post-tax weighted average cost  
of capital.
Where the carrying amount of an asset 
exceeds its recoverable amount, the asset is 
considered to be impaired and is written 
down to its recoverable amount. An 
impairment loss is recognised in the 
Consolidated Income Statement.
Financial instruments
Financial assets and liabilities are 
recognised in the Consolidated Statement 
of Financial Position when the Group 
becomes party to the contractual provisions 
of an instrument, at fair value adjusted for 
transaction costs except for financial assets 
classified at fair value through profit or loss, 
where transaction costs are immediately 
recognised in the Consolidated Income 
Statement. Financial assets are 
derecognised when the rights to receive 
cash flows from the investments have 
expired or where they have been transferred 
and the Group has also transferred 
substantially all risks and rewards of 
ownership. Financial liabilities cease to be 
recognised when the obligation under the 
liability has been discharged, cancelled or  
has expired.
Financial assets
Purchases and sales of financial assets  
are recognised at the trade date, being the 
date when the purchase or sale becomes 
contractually due for settlement. Delivery  
and settlement terms are usually  
determined by established practices  
in the market concerned.
Debt securities, equity securities and 
holdings in authorised collective investment 
schemes are designated as either fair value 
through profit or loss, or available-for-sale, 
and are measured at subsequent reporting 
dates at fair value. The Group determines 
the classification of its financial assets on 
initial recognition. Financial assets classified 
as fair value through profit or loss comprise 
the Group’s manager box positions in OEICs 
and unit trusts and investments in the 
Group’s fund products on behalf of 
employee benefit trusts, which are recorded 
on a fair value basis. Where securities are 
designated as fair value through profit or 
loss, gains and losses arising from changes 
in fair value are included in the Consolidated 
Income Statement.
For available-for-sale financial assets, gains 
and losses arising from changes in fair value 
which are not part of a designated hedge 
relationship are recognised in the 
Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive 
Income. When an asset is disposed of, the 
cumulative changes in fair value, previously 
recognised in the Consolidated Statement 
of Comprehensive Income, are taken to the 
Consolidated Income Statement in the 
current accounting period.
Unrealised gains and losses on financial 
assets represent the difference between the 
fair value of financial assets at the reporting 
date and cost or, if these have been 
previously revalued, the fair value at the last 
reporting date. Realised gains and losses 
on financial assets are calculated as the 
difference between the net sale proceeds 
and cost or amortised cost. 
Where a fall in the value of an investment is 
prolonged or significant, this is considered an 
indication of impairment. In such an event, the 
investment is written down to fair value and the 
amounts previously recognised in the 
Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive 
Income in respect of cumulative changes in 
fair value, are taken to the Consolidated 
Income Statement as an impairment charge.
Trade receivables, which generally have 
30-90 day payment terms, are initially 
recognised at fair value, normally equivalent 
to the invoice amount. When the time value 
of money is material, the fair value is 
discounted. Provision for specific doubtful 
debts is made when there is evidence that 
the Group will not be able to recover 
balances in full. Balances are written off 
when the receivable amount is deemed 
irrecoverable.
Cash amounts represent cash in hand and 
on-demand deposits. Cash equivalents are 
short-term highly liquid government 
securities or investments in money market 
instruments with a maturity date of three 
months or less.
Financial liabilities
Financial liabilities are stated at amortised 
cost using the effective interest rate 
method. Amortised cost is calculated by 
taking into account any issue costs and any 
discount or premium on settlement. A 
financial liability ceases to be recognised 
when the obligation under the liability has 
been discharged, cancelled or has expired.
Derivative financial instruments  
and hedging
The Group may, from time to time, use 
derivative financial instruments to hedge 
against price, interest rate, foreign currency 
and credit risk. Derivative financial 
instruments are classified as financial 
assets when the fair value is positive or as 
financial liabilities when the fair value is 
negative. 
At the inception of a hedge, the Group 
formally designates and documents the 
hedge relationship to which the Group 
wishes to apply hedge accounting and the 
risk management objective and strategy for 
undertaking the hedge. Such hedges are 
expected to be effective in achieving 
offsetting changes in fair value and are 
assessed on an ongoing basis to determine 
that they have been effective throughout 
the reporting periods for which they were 
designated and are expected to remain 
effective over the remaining hedge period. 62
Henderson Group  
Annual Report 201 1
2. Accounting policies continued
Currency hedges
Forward currency contracts are used to 
hedge the currency nominal value of certain 
euro and US dollar denominated available-
for-sale financial assets and are classified 
as fair value hedges. The change in the fair 
value of a hedging instrument is recognised 
in the Consolidated Income Statement. The 
change in the fair value of the hedged item, 
attributable to the risk being hedged, is also 
recognised in the Consolidated Income 
Statement, offsetting the fair value changes 
arising on the designated hedge instrument.
Fair value estimation
The fair value of financial instruments traded 
in active markets (such as publicly traded 
securities and derivatives) is based on 
quoted market prices at the reporting date. 
The quoted market price used for financial 
instruments is the current bid price. The fair 
value of financial instruments that are not 
traded in an active market is determined 
using valuation techniques commonly used 
by market participants, including the use of 
comparable recent arm’s length 
transactions, discounted cash flow analysis 
and option pricing models.
Provisions
Provisions which are liabilities of uncertain 
timing or amount, are recognised when: the 
Group has a present obligation, legal or 
constructive, as a result of a past event; it is 
probable that an outflow of resources 
embodying economic benefits will be required 
to settle the obligation; and a reliable estimate 
can be made of the amount of the obligation. 
In the event that the time value of money is 
material, provisions are determined by 
discounting the expected future cash flows at 
a discount rate that reflects a current market 
assessment of the time value of money and, 
where appropriate, the risks specific to the 
liability. When discounting, the increase in the 
provision due to the passage of time is 
recognised as a finance charge.
Foreign currencies
The functional currency of the Company is 
GBP. Transactions in foreign currencies are 
recorded at the appropriate exchange rate 
prevailing at the date of the transaction. 
Foreign currency monetary balances at the 
reporting date are converted at the 
prevailing exchange rate. Foreign currency 
non-monetary balances carried at fair value 
or cost are translated at the rates prevailing 
at the date when the fair value or cost is 
determined. Gains and losses arising on 
retranslation are taken to the Consolidated 
Income Statement, except for available-for-
sale financial assets where the unhedged 
changes in fair value are recognised in  
the Consolidated Statement of 
Comprehensive Income.
On consolidation, the assets and liabilities of 
the Group’s overseas operations whose 
functional currency is not GBP are 
translated at exchange rates prevailing at 
the reporting date. Income and expense 
items are translated at average exchange 
rates for the accounting period. Exchange 
differences arising, if any, are taken through 
the Consolidated Statement of 
Comprehensive Income to the translation 
reserve. In the period in which the operation 
is disposed of, these translation differences 
are then recognised in the Consolidated 
Income Statement.
Equity shares
The Company’s ordinary equity shares of 
12.5 pence each are classified as equity 
instruments. Equity shares issued by the 
Company are recorded at the fair value of 
the proceeds received or the market price 
on the day of issue. Direct issue costs, net of 
tax, are deducted from equity through share 
premium. When share capital is 
repurchased, the amount of consideration 
paid, including directly attributable costs, is 
recognised as a change in equity.
Own shares held
Own shares held are equity shares of the 
Company acquired by or issued to employee 
benefit trusts. Own shares held are recorded 
at cost and are deducted from equity. No 
gain or loss is recognised in the 
Consolidated Income Statement on the 
purchase, issue, sale or cancellation of the 
Company’s own equity shares. 
Dividend recognition
Dividend distributions to the Company’s 
shareholders are recognised in the 
accounting period in which the dividends are 
paid and, in the case of final dividends, when 
these are approved by the Company’s 
shareholders at the AGM. Dividend 
distributions are recognised in equity.
2.2  Significant accounting 
judgements, estimates 
and assumptions
In the process of applying the Group’s 
accounting policies, management has made 
significant judgements involving estimations 
and assumptions which are summarised 
below:
Impairment of goodwill
As explained on page 60, goodwill is 
reviewed for impairment annually or more 
frequently if changes in circumstances 
indicate that the carrying value may be 
impaired.
The judgement exercised by management in 
arriving at this valuation includes the 
selection of market growth rates, fund 
flow assumptions, expected margins and 
costs. Further details are given in note 13.
Share-based payment transactions
The Group measures the cost of equity-
settled share schemes at fair value at the date 
of grant and expenses them over the vesting 
period based on the Group’s estimate of 
shares that will eventually vest.
The liability for cash-settled share schemes 
represents the estimated transaction cost 
up to the settlement date, taking into 
account historical experience of good and 
bad leavers. 
Impairment of available-for-sale 
financial assets
Available-for-sale financial assets are 
reviewed for impairment at each reporting 
date or more frequently as required. In 
specific cases, where a quoted market price 
or fair value is not available, significant 
judgement is exercised by management in 
determining the extent of impairment, taking 
into account other available market data. 
Management also exercises judgement in 
determining whether a decrease in the value 
of an asset meets the prolonged or 
significant tests.
Pension and other post-employment 
benefits
The costs of and period end obligations 
under defined benefit pension schemes are 
determined using actuarial valuations. The 
actuarial valuation involves making 
assumptions about discount rates, expected 
rates of return on assets, future salary 
increases, mortality rates and future pension 
increases. Due to the long-term nature of 
these schemes, such estimates are subject 
to significant uncertainty. Further details are 
given in note 21.
Deferred tax assets
Deferred tax assets are recognised for 
unused tax losses to the extent that it is 
probable that future taxable profits will be 
available against which the losses can be 
utilised. Significant judgement is required by 
management in determining the amount of 
deferred tax assets that can be recognised, 
based upon the likely timing and level of 
future taxable profits together with future tax 
planning strategies.
Provisions
By their nature, provisions often reflect 
significant levels of judgement by 
management. The nature and amount of the 
provisions included in the Consolidated 
Statement of Financial Position are detailed 
in note 22 and contingencies not provided 
for are disclosed in note 32.
Accrued income
Accrued income is based on latest available 
information and involves a degree of 
estimation. The most significant estimation 
relates to the accrual of performance fees as 
described on page 59.
Notes to the Financial Statements  
Group and Company continued 63
Henderson Group  
Annual Report 201 1
Financials
Consolidation of seed investments
From time to time, the Group provides seed 
capital on the launch of its products, such as 
UCITSs, SICAVs, hedge funds and other 
investment vehicles. The seed capital 
investments vary in duration depending on 
the nature of the investment, with a typical 
range of less than one year for Investment 
Management products and between three 
and seven years for Private Equity and 
Property funds. Given the limited size and 
nature of these investments, the Group does 
not consider itself to have significant 
influence or control over the underlying 
funds to warrant accounting for them using 
the equity method or consolidating them in 
the Group’s financial statements. 
2.3 Changes in accounting policies
The accounting policies adopted in this 
Annual Report and Accounts are consistent 
with those of the previous financial year. The 
Group has also adopted any IFRS or IFRIC 
interpretations that are effective for the first 
time for the financial year beginning on or 
after 1 January 201 1. There were no new 
standards effective for the current year 
which had a material impact on the Group.
2.4  Future changes in accounting 
policies
During the course of the year, the IASB and 
the IFRIC issued a number of new 
accounting standards, amendments to 
existing standards and interpretations. The 
following new standards are not applicable 
to these financial statements but are 
expected to have an impact when they 
become effective. The Group plans to apply 
these standards in the reporting period in 
which they become effective. 
IFRS 10 Consolidated Financial Statements 
defines the principle of control, and 
establishes control as the basis for 
consolidation in the preparation of 
consolidated financial statements. This 
standard has a mandatory effective date  
in 2013. 
IFRS 1 1 Joint Arrangements states that 
when deciding how to account for joint 
ventures, the focus is on rights and 
obligations. This standard has a mandatory 
effective date in 2013.
IFRS 12 Disclosure of Involvement with 
Interests in Other Entities includes the 
disclosure requirements for all forms of 
interests in other entities, such as joint 
arrangements, associates and other off 
balance sheet vehicles. This standard has  
a mandatory effective date in 2013.
IFRS 9 Financial Instruments proposes 
revised measurement and classification 
criteria for financial assets. This standard 
has a mandatory effective date in 2015. 
The Group is assessing the impact of the 
above standards on the Group’s future 
financial statements. 64

An interest rate swap was entered into at the time of issuing the 2012 Notes in May 2007, to swap the fixed coupon of 6.5% per annum into 
six month sterling LIBOR plus 85.75bps per annum. The swap was unwound on 9 December 2008 and the cumulative fair value adjustment 
to the debt carrying value, attributable to the hedged interest rate risk up to the date of unwinding, £10.5m, is being amortised over the 
remaining term of the debt to maturity on 2 May 2012. In 201 1, the impact of the amortisation of the profit on unwinding the swap is a 
reduction in finance expenses of £2.7m (2010: £3.1m).

Gartmore integration costs
On 4 April 201 1, the Group’s acquisition of Gartmore was completed. In relation to the acquisition and integration of Gartmore, costs of 
£69.7m before tax have been incurred during the period. These costs mainly relate to staff related expenses, legal and professional fees, 
transition of outsourced retail and investment operations, office relocation and reorganisation and fund mergers.
Restructuring costs
In response to the market downturn in the second half of 201 1, the Group has restructured certain parts of its business, incurring staff related 
costs of £6.0m. 
New Star void property provision release
A void property provision recognised on the acquisition of New Star in 2009 has been reassessed resulting in a release of £6.5m.
Non-recurring tax
Following the acquisition of Gartmore, the Group reassessed the potential utilisation of previously unrecognised tax assets and tax liabilities 
recognised by Gartmore in the first quarter of 201 1. Consequently a deferred tax asset of £14.8m has been recognised in respect of the 
expected utilisation of these assets against future taxable profits and £4.1m of Gartmore tax liabilities have been released.
2010
FSCS interim levy
In November 2010, the FSCS indicated that it would raise an interim levy on investment managers in respect of claims received primarily from 
investors in Keydata Investment Services Limited (in administration). The Group provided for this levy in full during 2010. 
Goodwill impairment
The goodwill allocated to the NSIM cash generating unit, (a specialised segregated company formerly part of New Star), as a result of an earn 
out deal in respect of that company, was impaired in full as a result of a 50% decline in AUM.
Towry Law International provision release
During the second half of 2010, the majority of a previously recognised product mis-selling provision, relating to legacy Towry Law 
International products, was deemed no longer required and was released. This resulted in a £5.8m credit in 2010.
Non-recurring tax
During the second half of 2010, HMRC closed enquiries into certain prior year tax filings, resulting in the Group releasing tax provisions  
of £16.4m.

Group
10.1 Share-based compensation plans
The following share-based compensation plans were in operation during 201 1:
Restricted Share Plan (RSP)
The RSP is a scheme that allows employees to receive shares in the Company for £nil consideration at a future point, usually after three years. 
The awards are made typically for staff recruitment and retention purposes and generally, the larger awards have a performance hurdle. The 
Remuneration Committee must approve all awards and the vesting of awards over £50,000. On vesting, in order to obtain the shares, the 
employee must satisfy any employee tax and social security obligations. 
Employee Share Ownership Plan (ESOP)
The 2008 ESOP enabled all staff, excluding Executive Directors, to defer part of their annual bonus into the ESOP, up to a specified limit, 
through the purchase of Company shares. The 2008 ESOP awarded one free matching share for every share purchased. To receive the 
matching shares, employees had to remain in the plan for three years. Matching shares for the 2008 ESOP vested in June 201 1. Forfeiture 
conditions apply in the case of approved and unapproved leavers. No plan was offered in 2009 or 2010.
The 201 1 ESOP enabled all staff, including the Executive Directors, to defer part of their annual bonus into the plan up to a specified limit 
through the purchase of Company shares. The 201 1 ESOP awards up to three matching shares for every share purchased depending on the 
achievement of the Henderson Group TSR and Company share price performance. The plan is a five year plan with one third of the matching 
shares vesting on the third, fourth and fifth anniversary of the plan, if the conditions have been met on these anniversaries. 
Long-Term Incentive Plan (LTIP)
The LTIP is a scheme that grants selected employees restricted shares or nil cost options that have employment conditions and performance 
conditions attached as shown below. Employees who have been awarded nil cost options have five years to exercise their options following the 
three year vesting period:
 
Criteria
Amount vesting 
2008 to 2011 plans
Henderson Group TSR less than the 50th percentile of the FTSE 350 General Financial Services companies nil%
Henderson Group TSR at the 50th percentile of the FTSE 350 General Financial Services companies 25%
Henderson Group TSR at or above the 75th percentile of the FTSE 350 General Financial Services companies 100%
For a Henderson Group TSR between the 50th and 75th percentiles, the amount vesting will increase on a linear basis. In addition, the 
Remuneration Committee must be satisfied the Henderson Group TSR reflects the underlying performance of the Group.
For the 201 1 LTIP, employees who are US citizens have been awarded performance shares as opposed to nil cost options but the vesting and 
forfeiture criteria remain the same. The Henderson Risk team, because of the nature of their role, have different corporate risk related 
performance and vesting conditions that must be approved by the Board Risk Committee. 
Employees are entitled to dividend equivalents. Dividend equivalents are paid based on the dividends declared during the three year vesting 
period in respect of the shares that vest at the end of the three year period. The dividend equivalents are payable in two equal tranches, at the 
end of years four and five. 
The employees are not entitled to vote or receive dividends in respect of these awards until the vesting conditions are met, nor are they 
allowed to pledge, hedge or assign the expected awards in any way.
In accordance with the scheme terms, the 2008 LTIP met its vesting conditions on 31 December 2010 and the awards vested in February 
201 1. The TSR performance condition resulted in 100% of the award being capable of exercise. The 2009 LTIP met its vesting conditions  
on 31 December 201 1 and the awards will vest in April 2012. The TSR performance condition resulted in 100% of the award being capable  
of exercise. 70

10.1 Share-based compensation plans continued
Deferred Equity Plan (DEP)
Under the Group’s remuneration policy, for employees who receive cash-based incentive awards, over a preset threshold, an element of their 
award is deferred. The majority of deferrals are deferred into the Company’s shares, with some deferrals into Group managed funds when 
deemed appropriate. The deferred monies are paid to the DEP trustee, who purchases shares or units or shares in Group products and holds 
them in trust subject to employment conditions. In 2008, these shares attracted one free matching share for every four shares awarded by  
the trustee. Since 2008, there has been no matching share element.
Hedge fund performance fee deferrals into hedge funds are held in trust for two years on a fully restricted basis and have no matching elements.
Forfeiture conditions apply in the case of approved and unapproved leavers. 
Deferrals relating to 2009 awards were deferred into the Company’s shares for up to two years and vest in two equal tranches. Deferrals 
relating to 2010 and 201 1 awards were deferred for up to three years and vest in three equal tranches. For those employees who elected to 
participate in the 201 1 ESOP, their restricted shares upon vesting (three equal tranches in 2012, 2013 and 2014) automatically transfer into 
the 201 1 ESOP as bonus shares and in order to obtain matching shares become subject to the performance and employment conditions of 
that plan.
The expense of deferred short-term incentive awards is recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement over the period of deferral. As at 31 
December 201 1, £21.1m (2010: £14.1m) of deferred awards are to be recognised in future periods.
Buy As You Earn Share Plan (BAYE)
The BAYE is a HMRC approved plan. Eligible employees who wish to purchase shares in the Company invest a monthly amount up to a 
maximum of £125, which is deducted from their gross salary. Each participating employee receives, for no additional payment, two free 
matching shares for each share purchased (partnership shares). Partnership shares will be forfeited if purchased shares are withdrawn from 
the trust within one year.
The Group introduced an international version of the BAYE during 2010. It operates on a similar basis to the UK version, the principal 
differences are that there is no forfeiture of shares awarded and that each participating employee receives one free matching share for each 
share purchased.
Company Share Option Plan (CSOP)
The CSOP is a HMRC approved share option plan and the maximum value of unvested options at any time is limited to £30,000 for UK employees. No 
such restrictions apply for overseas employees. It is a global plan that provides employees with an opportunity to buy shares after a three year vesting 
period at an option price fixed at the start of the scheme. There are no Group performance conditions attached to the options. At vesting, the employee 
must choose whether or not to exercise the options within two years of the vesting date. Executive Directors are not eligible to participate in the CSOP 
because it has no Group performance conditions although they may hold awards made prior to their executive appointment. 
Executive Shared Ownership Plan (ExSOP)
The ExSOP is an employee shared ownership plan and is aimed at encouraging employee share ownership at middle management level. 
Executive Directors do not participate in the ExSOP. 
Under the terms of the ExSOP, certain employees may be invited to acquire jointly with an employee benefit trust, the beneficial interest in a 
number of shares under the terms of a joint ownership agreement (JOA). Under a JOA, the employee will benefit from any growth in value of 
the jointly owned shares from the time of the award in excess of a hurdle amount fixed by the Board in respect of each award. 
For the 201 1 ExSOP, the market price at grant was £1.61 (2010: £1.24) per share. The hurdle price including the 9% carry charge was set at 
£1.76 (2010: £1.35) per share. The shares have a vesting period of three years. The employees then have a further two years to take their 
portion of the jointly owned shares.
Sharesave scheme (SAYE)
The SAYE is a HMRC approved plan. UK employees may participate in more than one scheme but only up to a maximum of £250 per month 
across all schemes. Eligible employees who participate in the SAYE contribute a monthly amount from their net salary to a savings account. 
The SAYE vesting period is three years for UK employees.
A 201 1 SAYE offering was made during the year. At the end of a three year period, the employees in the 201 1 SAYE can choose to exercise 
their share options using the funds in their account, together with a bonus equivalent to 0.1 (2009 SAYE: 0.6 and 2010 SAYE: 0.3) times the 
monthly saving amount, to subscribe for shares at a preset price. This was £1.31 (2009 SAYE: £0.58 and 2010 SAYE: £1.00) per share, a 
20% discount to the share price on the average share price of 7 to 1 1 March 201 1 (2009 SAYE: 4 March 2009 and 2010 SAYE: average of 
first five working days of March 2010). Employees have up to six months after the three year period to exercise their options and subscribe for 
shares. Forfeiture provisions apply in the case of approved and unapproved leavers. The 2008 SAYE vested in 201 1.
In 2006, the Group launched the USA Employee Share Purchase Plan (ESPP). The ESPP works broadly on the same principles as the UK 
SAYE but has a two year savings period, a lower discount level at 15% and no bonus element. In 201 1, the preset option price was USD2.19 
(2009 ESPP: USD0.88 and 2010 ESPP: USD1.62). Employees may participate in more than one plan but only up to a plan maximum of 
USD312.50 per month across all sharesave plans.
Gartmore plans
The Gartmore plans are schemes that allow employees to receive shares in the Company for £nil consideration at a future point, usually after 
three years. The awards were made by Gartmore, prior to the Group’s acquisition, typically for staff retention purposes. On vesting, in order to 
obtain the shares, the employee must still be in employment and must satisfy any employee tax and social security obligations. These awards 
are now governed by the rules covering the Group’s DEP and RSP awards.

Final dividend for 2H11 (2H10) 55.4 5.05 38.8 4.65
The Board is recommending a final dividend for 2H1 1 of 5.05 pence per share which, when added to the interim 1H1 1 dividend of 1.95 pence 
per share, results in a total dividend for 201 1 of 7.0 pence per share. 
The dividend proposed in respect of 2H1 1 of £55.4m is based on the total number of ordinary shares in issue at 31 December 201 1. 
There is an increase of £9.8m between the proposed dividends (2H10 final: £38.8m, 1H1 1 interim: £21.3m), as reported in the 2010 Annual 
Report and Accounts and the Interim Results for the six months to 30 June 201 1, versus the dividends paid out during the year (2H10 final: 
£49.2m, 1H1 1 interim: £20.7m). This represents an additional £1 1.3m of dividends paid as a result of the Gartmore acquisition offset by a 
decrease of £1.5m in relation to dividends waived by employee benefit trust trustees on shares held in trust on behalf of Group employees. 
The amount waived in respect of the final dividend declared for 201 1 will be established by the employee benefit trust trustees on 4 May 
2012, being the dividend record date.
Pursuant to the Income Access Share arrangements, shareholders in the Company are able to elect to receive their dividends from 
a UK source. Shareholders will be deemed to have elected to receive their dividends under the Income Access Share arrangements unless 
they have elected to receive them directly from the Company. All elections remain in force indefinitely unless revoked. Shareholders who have 
opted out of the Income Access Share arrangements will receive dividends from an Irish source and will be taxed accordingly. 74

The Group considers itself to have one cash generating unit to which goodwill is allocated. 
The recoverable amount of goodwill for the Group at 31 December 201 1 has been determined from a value in use calculation, using the 
budgets and forecasts approved by the Board and a terminal value for the period thereafter. The key growth assumptions used in the budgets 
and forecasts include assumptions in line with the Group’s accounting policy. The terminal value has been calculated assuming a long-term 
growth rate of 2% per annum in perpetuity, based on the Group’s view of long-term nominal growth. A pre-tax risk adjusted discount rate of 
1 1.6% per annum has been applied.
The resultant value in use calculation has been compared with the carrying amount of goodwill to determine if any goodwill impairment arises. 
The calculation shows significant headroom in the recoverable amount of goodwill. 
The value in use calculation has been flexed for a 40% drop in markets in 2012 and a comparable decrease in costs. This calculation also 
shows headroom in the recoverable amount of goodwill. 
Recent market transactions and the Group’s current market capitalisation provide additional evidence that the recoverable amount of goodwill 
is in excess of the carrying amount. 76

Other investments consist of investments in the Group’s fund products which are held, in employee benefit trusts, against outstanding 
deferred compensation arrangements. Any movement in fair value of the assets is offset by a corresponding movement in the deferred 
compensation liability in the Consolidated Income Statement.
The Group enters into forward foreign exchange contracts to hedge various financial assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currency 
and therefore applies fair value hedge accounting. In 2008, an interest rate swap held on the 2012 Notes was unwound and the cumulative 
fair value adjustment to the carrying value of the 2012 Notes up to the date of unwinding, is being amortised and the credit is recognised in 
the Consolidated Income Statement over the remaining term of the debt, which matures on 2 May 2012 (refer to note 20).
Debtor and creditor balances, included in the tables above, represent balances mainly settling in a short time frame, and accordingly, the fair 
value of these assets and liabilities is considered to be materially equal to their carrying value after taking into account any impairment.
Company
In 201 1, the Company classified other investments as financial assets at fair value through profit or loss with a carrying value and fair value of 
£7.4m (2010: £nil). These investments are disclosed as Level 1 and Level 2 using the hierarchy set out on the following page. During 201 1, 
there were no transfers in or out of Level 1, Level 2 and Level 3 (2010: £nil).

Fair value hierarchy
The Group uses the following hierarchy for determining and disclosing the fair value of financial assets and liabilities by valuation 
technique:
Level 1: quoted (unadjusted) prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities;
Level 2: other techniques where all inputs, which have a significant effect on the recorded fair value, are observable, either directly 
or indirectly; and
Level 3: techniques where inputs which have a significant effect on the recorded fair value that are not based on observable 
market data.

As the fair value measurement of the financial assets included in Level 3 is based on both observable and non-observable inputs, a 
change in one or more underlying assumptions could result in a significant change in fair value. However, due to the numerous different 
factors affecting the assets, the impact cannot be quantified.  80

The debt instruments in issue represent, at par, £142.6m 2012 Notes and £150.0m 2016 Notes listed on the LSE. 
The 2012 Notes are unsecured, unrated and repayable in full on 2 May 2012 and bear interest at a fixed rate of 6.5% per annum payable six 
monthly. On 24 March 201 1, the Group extinguished £32.4m of the 2012 Notes and exchanged them into the 2016 Notes. The fair value of 
the 2012 Notes is £145.1m (2010: £179.2m).
The Group swapped the fixed interest coupon on the 2012 Notes into a floating rate on issue of the notes. The swap was unwound on 
9 December 2008. The fair value adjustment to the debt carrying value, attributable to the hedged interest rate risk up to the date of 
unwinding the swap, £10.5m, is being amortised over the remaining term of the notes. 
On 24 March 201 1, the Group issued £150.0m of 2016 Notes which are unsecured, unrated and repayable in full on 24 March 2016 and bear 
interest at a fixed rate of 7.25% per annum payable six monthly. The fair value of the 2016 Notes is £157.3m.

The expected return on assets assumption is the weighted average of the expected returns from each of the portfolios as shown above. The 
expected rate of return on assets is based on long-term expectations as at 31 December 201 1. The expected rate of return on bonds, 
constituting the risk reducing portfolio, has been set by reference to current market yields on long-dated government bonds. The rates of 
return for the equities, property and cash asset classes, constituting the return seeking and cash portfolios, have been based on the Group’s 
expectations of investment returns over the longer term.

On 8 July 2010, the UK Government announced its intention that statutory minimum pension indexation for private sector UK pension 
schemes would, in future, be linked to the Consumer Price Index (CPI) rather than RPI. This was enacted in April 201 1 and as a result in 201 1, 
the Group has moved from RPI to CPI as the basis for revaluation of certain obligations.
(b) Demographic assumptions
The demographic assumptions used as at 31 December 201 1 are consistent with those underlying the last actuarial valuation of HGPS in 
2008. Post-retirement mortality assumptions follow 100% of the SAPS ‘S1 Light’ tables and improvements from 2002 in line with the 
‘medium cohort’ projections with an underpin of 1% per annum. The table below illustrates the implied life expectancies as at 31 December

21.2 Gartmore Pension Scheme – Final Salary Scheme
As part of the acquisition of Gartmore in April 201 1, the Group acquired the assets and liabilities of the Gartmore Pension Scheme (GPS). 
GPS was closed to new entrants and future accrual for existing members in 2006. The sponsor and participating company is Gartmore 
Investment Management Limited. The actuarial advisers to GPS are Lane Clark & Peacock LLP.
The 201 1 GPS accounting valuation under IAS 19, Employee Benefits, is based on full membership data as at 31 December 2008 and 
adjusted for movements in membership data until 31 December 201 1. The GPS assets are stated at their fair values as at 31 December 201 1. 
The next triennial valuation will take place during 2012 based on 31 December 201 1 membership data.

21.3 Henderson Group unapproved pension schemes
The Group operates three unapproved pension schemes, the details of which are provided below:
Pearl Executive Scheme. Members of this scheme are also members of HGPS. However, pensionable earnings under HGPS are limited to 
1/60th for each year of service and the earnings cap. The Pearl Executive Scheme provides benefits at 1/30th for each year of service with  
a maximum of two thirds of salary after 20 years’ service based on pensionable earnings above the earnings cap, on an unfunded basis;
Henderson Top Up Scheme. Members of this scheme are also members of HGPS. However, pensionable earnings under HGPS are limited to 
the earnings cap, and the Henderson Top Up Scheme enables benefits to be based on pensionable earnings without restriction of the 
earnings cap. These additional uncapped benefits are provided on an unfunded basis; and 
there is also an unfunded liability in respect of one member, to whom the Group has made a contractual promise to pay a fixed pension from 
age 60.

The change in the UK corporation tax rate from 27% to 25% with effect from 1 April 2012 resulted in a reduction of £3.2m in the net 
deferred tax liablity of the Group. Proposed further reductions of the UK corporation tax rate of 1% per annum to 23% by 1 April 2014 are 
anticipated to be enacted separately each year. The Group estimates the aggregate impact of the proposed reductions from 25% to 23% may 
reduce the deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities by approximately £2.3m and £4.9m respectively.
At the reporting date, the Group has unused tax losses in respect of which no deferred tax has been recognised as utilisation of the losses is 
dependent on future profits. The unrecognised deferred tax asset in respect of trading losses carried forward is £13.5m (2010: £29.7m). The 
unrecognised deferred tax asset in respect of capital losses carried forward is £14.6m (2010: £16.1m). The losses have no expiry date.
Consistent with prior years, deferred tax is not recognised in respect of taxable timing differences associated with the Group’s investments in 
subsidiaries, branches, associates and joint ventures where the Group controls the timing of the reversal of the temporary differences and 
where the reversal of the temporary differences is not anticipated in the foreseeable future (2010: £nil). 90

28.  Financial risk management
Financial risk management objectives and policies
Financial assets principally comprise investments in equity securities, short-term investments, trade and other receivables, and cash and cash 
equivalents. Financial liabilities comprise borrowings for financing purposes, certain provisions and trade and other payables. The main risks 
arising from financial instruments are price risk, interest rate risk, liquidity risk, foreign currency risk and credit risk. Each of these risks is 
examined in detail below. The Group monitors financial risks on a consolidated basis and intra-Group balances are settled when it is deemed 
appropriate for both parties to the transaction. The Company is not exposed to material financial risk and separate disclosures for the 
Company have not been included.
The Group has designed a framework to manage the risks of its business and to ensure that the Directors have in place risk management 
practices appropriate for a listed company. The management of risk within the Group is governed by the Board and overseen by the Board 
Risk Committee.
28.1 Price risk
Price risk is the risk that a decline in the value of assets adversely impacts on the profitability of the Group.
The Group is exposed to price risk in respect of seed capital investments in Group funds (available-for-sale financial assets). Seed capital 
investments vary in duration, depending on the nature of the investment, with a typical range of less than one year for Investment Management 
products and between three and seven years for Private Equity and Property funds. The total market value of seed capital investments at  
31 December 201 1 was £54.3m (2010: £46.6m). 
Management monitors exposures to price risk on an ongoing basis. Significant movements in investment values are monitored on a daily basis. 
Where appropriate, management will hedge price risk. At 31 December 201 1, investments with a carrying value of £1.4m (2010: £2.9m) were 
hedged against price risk through the use of contracts for difference (CFDs).
A fall in the value of an investment which is prolonged or significant is considered to be objective evidence of impairment under IAS 39 
Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement. In such an event, an investment is written down to its fair value and cumulative amounts 
previously recognised in equity, in respect of market value and unhedged foreign exchange movements on the investment, are recognised in 
the Consolidated Income Statement as an impairment charge.

28.2 Interest rate risk
Interest rate risk is the risk that the Group will sustain losses from adverse movements in interest rates, either through a mismatch of interest-
bearing assets and liabilities, or through the effect such movements have on the value of interest-bearing assets. The Group is exposed to 
interest rates on banking deposits held in the ordinary course of business. Available-for-sale financial assets are not currently exposed to 
interest rate risk. This exposure is monitored by management on a continuing basis.

Interest on financial instruments classified as floating rate are repriced at intervals of less than one year. Interest on financial instruments 
classified as fixed rate are fixed until the maturity of the instrument. Asset and liabilities categorised as fixed rate or other are not exposed to 
interest rate risk.
Interest rate risk sensitivity analysis
Interest rate risk sensitivity analysis on the Consolidated Income Statement has been performed on the basis of a 50bps per annum fall in 
interest rates at the beginning of the year. The impact of such a decrease would reduce finance income by approximately £1.4m per annum in 
the Consolidated Income Statement. 94

28.3 Liquidity risk
Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group may be unable to meet its payment obligations as they fall due.
Group liquidity is managed on a daily basis by Group Finance, to ensure that the Group always has sufficient cash or highly liquid assets 
available to meet its liabilities. Group Finance also controls and monitors the use of the Group’s non-operating capital resources. It is the 
Group’s policy to ensure that it has access to funds to cover all forecast commitments for at least the next 12 months.

28.4 Foreign currency risk
Foreign currency risk is the risk that the Group will sustain losses through adverse movements in currency exchange rates.
The Group is exposed to foreign currency risk through its exposure to non-GBP income, expenses, assets and liabilities of its overseas 
subsidiaries as well as net assets and liabilities denominated in a currency other than GBP. The currency exposure is managed by closely 
monitoring foreign currency positions. The Group also uses foreign currency contracts to reduce or eliminate the currency exposure on certain 
individual transactions. The Group also seeks to use natural hedges to reduce exposure. Where there is a mismatch on material currency flows 
and the timing is reasonably certain, they are actively hedged. Where there is insufficient certainty, the currency is translated back into GBP 
on receipt. In addition, the Group carries a small foreign exchange position as principal, to facilitate the smooth conduct of its client business.
Foreign currency risk management is overseen by the Hedge Committee and hedge effectiveness is reported to the Board monthly.
A rolling programme of forward currency contracts has been implemented to hedge the currency exposures arising from certain available-for-
sale financial assets, with a year end notional value of USD43.7m and EUR7.8m (2010: USD44.7m and EUR7.8m) (refer to note 28.6).
Foreign currency risk sensitivity analysis
Available-for-sale financial assets are either denominated in GBP or hedged back to GBP using foreign currency forward contracts based on 
the Group’s hedging policy. However, there remain some available-for-sale financial assets which are not fully hedged as they fall below the 
policy level for implementing hedging arrangements. In addition, there are unhedged foreign currency cash balances and net trading receipts 
in subsidiaries of the Group.

28.5 Credit risk
Credit risk is the risk of a counterparty of the Group defaulting on funds deposited with it or the non-receipt of a trade debt. 
The Group has an established credit policy to ensure that it only transacts with counterparties that are able to meet satisfactory rating 
requirements. Counterparty limits are reviewed and set centrally by the Credit Risk Committee. Management is responsible for ensuring that it 
remains within these limits and the risk management function monitors and reports any exceptions to policy. The Group has not suffered any 
losses as a result of trade debtor or counterparty defaults during the year.
The Risk Management function is also responsible for reporting credit exposures to the Board Risk Committee on a quarterly basis and for 
ensuring that any credit concerns are raised and actions taken to mitigate risks.

28.6 Hedging activities
At 31 December 201 1, the Group held CFDs to hedge the price risk arising from certain available-for-sale financial assets. These have been 
assessed as effective fair value hedges. The net realised and unrealised loss arising on these and other instruments entered into throughout 
the year amounted to £0.4m (2010: £0.4m) and has been offset in the Consolidated Income Statement by £0.4m (2010: £0.5m), being the 
net realised and unrealised gain on available-for-sale financial assets in designated hedging relationships during the year. At 31 December 
201 1, the fair value and notional amount of the CFDs was £nil (2010: £nil).
At 31 December 201 1, the Group held forward exchange contracts to hedge the foreign currency risk arising from available-for-sale financial 
assets denominated in euro and US dollars (refer to note 28.4).
These forward exchange contracts have been assessed as effective fair value hedges. The net realised and unrealised loss arising on these 
and other instruments entered into throughout the year amounted to £0.4m (2010: £0.7m) and has been offset in the Consolidated Income 
Statement by £0.4m (2010: £0.6m), being the net realised and unrealised foreign exchange gain on available-for-sale financial assets in 
designated hedging relationships during the year. The fair value of these hedges is set out in the table below:

Operating leases
The Group is party to four material property leases. A 20.5 year operating lease was entered into during 2008 on 201 Bishopsgate, London 
which provides for reviews to open market rent on every fifth anniversary of the lease and provided an initial rent-free period of 30 months. 
The rental expense on this lease is being recognised on a straight-line basis over the lease period.
On acquisition of New Star and Gartmore, the Group became party to three further material operating leases. These are in relation to 1 
Knightsbridge Green, London, 8 Lancelot Place, London and Rex House, Queen Street, London. At the reporting date, the leases run for a 
period of five, 1 1 and 14 years respectively. A void properties provision has been recognised for these leases at the net present value of the 
net expected future cash outflows (refer to note 22). 
The future minimum lease payments under the four non-cancellable operating leases fall due as follows:
 
2011 
£m

33.1  Acquisitions 
Subsequent to the provisional accounting for the acquisition, the fair value of the investments accounted for using the equity method has been 
updated to reflect the value at the time of acquisition. In addition, the Group has recognised the retirement benefit asset relating to GPS, net of 
tax at source and a further adjustment relating to trade and other payables. Goodwill has been adjusted by £51.0m accordingly and results in 
£238.3m being recognised by the Group. The acquisition accounting has now been finalised. 
The business acquired is now integrated within the Group’s existing businesses and functions and therefore a separate identification of 
revenue and results after the acquisition date is impracticable.
The goodwill recognised above is attributable to the expected synergies and other benefits from combining the activities of Gartmore and 
those of the Group. The intangible assets represent the fair value of investment management contracts acquired, which are being amortised 
over periods of between four and six years. The trade and other receivables were not impaired at acquisition.
33.2  Disposals
On 1 July 201 1, the Group disposed of its investment in WorldInvest Management Ltd., New Star Institutional Managers Limited and New Star 
Canada Inc. and on 16 December 201 1, its investment in Gartmore JV Limited and Hermes GPE LLP. 100

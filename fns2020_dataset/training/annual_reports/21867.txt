STRATEGIC REPORT
Overview
We are a market-leading global specialty 
insurer and the largest business that 
trades solely on the Lloyd’s of London 
platform, the world’s leading specialist 
commercial insurance market. 
We provide highly specialised insurance 
products to support our clients across  
a broad range of complex risks, with  
a strong focus on property, energy and 
casualty business. 
We operate globally via our own 
international distribution network that 
benefits from Lloyd’s global licences. 
Our underwriting capabilities are 
underpinned by strong financials and 
our commitment to deliver superior 
returns to our shareholders.
We consider asset management as  
a core competency and integral  
part of our business. We seek to 
optimize the risk-adjusted return on  
our asset portfolio while never losing  
sight of our ongoing obligations to 
policyholders. 
Underwriting
Brit predominantly underwrites complex, 
high value insurance and reinsurance 
business. Insurance forms in excess of 
80% of our GWP . Our largest source  
of business is the US excess and  
surplus lines market and the majority  
of our premium income is denominated 
in US dollars, although the risks 
underwritten are distributed globally. 
We complement our core classes with 
highly specialised niche lines which 
provide diversification and the potential 
for high returns.
We underwrite primarily in London, but 
have developed an extensive network 
of local offices in the US, Bermuda, 
Japan and China to access business 
that does not usually reach Lloyd’s. We 
lead or are second agreement party 
on approximately 70% of the business 
we write, underlining our underwriting 
strength and expertise.
We source our business from a range 
of producers including the three largest 
brokers and also from a wide range of 
middle tier intermediaries. The majority 
of reinsurance business is sourced 
through the global reinsurance brokers.
Our platform and operations
We operate a strong and efficient capital 
model, with significant capital strength 
(as demonstrated by our 150.4% capital 
ratio), combined with capital efficiency 
resulting from our focus on the Lloyd’s 
platform.
Our underwriting and investment teams 
are supported by an efficient, flexible 
and scalable operating platform.  
We believe that the platform provides 
a stable foundation that enables us 
to pursue our strategy of focusing 
on maximising profitability of the 
underwriting business and extending  
our global distribution network.
Investment Management
At Brit we have a significant investment 
portfolio comprising financial invest-
ments, investment-related derivatives 
and cash. The value of our invested 
assets at 31 December 2014 was 
£2.6bn. The principal focus is on a 
portfolio of income-generating assets 
across a range of sectors to balance 
risk and return, complemented by 
an allocation to growth assets. The 
investment portfolio is managed for the 
most part by external asset managers 
under the direction of an experienced 
in-house team. Despite the low rate and 
challenging investment environment, 
our portfolio has generated favourable 
returns net of investment management 
fees in recent years (2014: 2.9%; 2013: 
2.1%; 2012: 2.9%).
Our culture and values
We are passionate about our business, 
our people and our customers and we 
have focused on cultivating a franchise 
that is built on delivering exceptional 
service. Our culture is centred on 
achievement and we have established 
a framework that identifies and rewards 
strong performance. Our objectives are 
aligned to those of our departments and 
employees, so that all of our employees 
understand the vital part they play in  
our success.

OUR TRACK RECORD 
AND FINANCIAL 
STRENGTH
OUR CAPABILITIES AND AMBITION ARE  
UNDERPINNED BY OUR STRONG FINANCIAL  
POSITION. OUR BUSINESS IS UNDERWRITTEN  
EXCLUSIVELY THROUGH OUR WHOLLY-
ALIGNED LLOYD’S SYNDICATE 2987, WHICH 
BENEFITS FROM LLOYD’S RATINGS OF  
A (EXCELLENT) FROM A.M. BEST, AA- (VERY 
STRONG) FROM FITCH RATINGS AND A+ 
(STRONG) FROM STANDARD & POOR’S. 
Track record  
Over the past six years, we have success-
fully transformed Brit into a simpler, more 
focused, more profitable, more efficient 
and more dynamic business, driven by 
some of the industry’s best talent. We 
have been proactive in delivering the 
best service for our clients and attractive 
returns to shareholders.
Over this six-year period Brit has 
demonstrated a strong track record 
of profitable underwriting, strong net 
investment returns and growth in core 
business lines.
We have also demonstrated disciplined 
capital management, with paid or 
recommended distributions totalling 
87.7% of total value created over the 
period 2011 to 2014. In addition the 
Group released a further £270m of 
capital to shareholders following the 
successful sale of the UK Insurance 
company in 2012. Over the same 
period, we have grown our surplus 
capital adjusted for the recommended 
2014 dividends, to £251.7m.
In 2014, we continued to build on this 
track record with 9.8% growth in gross 
written premium (GWP) to £1.3bn, 
profit after tax of £139.0m and return 
on adjusted net tangible assets before 
foreign exchange movements and IPO 
costs (RoNTA) of 20.7%.
Financial strength
At 31 December 2014 we had capital 
resources equal to 150.4% of the 
management capital requirements 
needed to support our business. Our 
capital strength provides flexibility to 
allow us to cope with major losses while 
not deviating from our commitment 
to fund profitable expansion and to 
provide an attractive dividend for 
shareholders.

STRATEGIC REPORT
In 2011, Brit was acquired by Achilles 
Netherlands Holdings B.V , a member of 
a Luxembourg-based group backed by  
a number of investment funds managed 
by Apollo and CVC private equity houses. 
Brit subsequently delisted from the 
London Stock Exchange and embarked 
on a major restructuring programme. 
Successful transformation 
Over the period from 2008 to 2012, we 
carried out a significant transformation, 
refocusing our strategy as set out on 
pages 10 and 11. In 2008, following the 
global financial crises, we commenced  
re-underwriting significant portions of 
the portfolio and then continued in 2011 
with the streamlining of our business 
model under new ownership and new 
management. There were five key themes 
to this transformation:
• Focus on the Lloyd’s platform and 
disposal of non-core businesses;
• Focus on underwriting shorter tail 
more profitable business lines;
• Improvement of investment 
capability, performance and controls;
• Expense efficiency and operational 
scalability; and
• Strong capital management.
 
This major programme of change delivered  
excellent and improving results in 2011, 
2012 and 2013 and we successfully 
executed an Initial Public Offering (IPO) of 
25% of Brit PLC and were admitted to the 
London Stock Exchange on 2 April 2014. 
Brit PLC is now a member of the FTSE 
250. With the formation of this new UK 
incorporated parent company, we moved 
the domicile of the Group back to the UK. 
The move affirms our commitment to the 
UK and its supportive business, political 
and regulatory regimes.

STRATEGY, KEY  
OBJECTIVE AND  
STRATEGIC PRIORITIES
WE HAVE REPOSITIONED BRIT TO 
PUT OUR LLOYD’S PLATFORM AT THE 
CENTRE OF WHAT WE DO AND SET OUR 
UNDERWRITING STRATEGY ACCORDINGLY 
TO FOCUS ON COMPLEX, SPECIALTY LINES 
OF INSURANCE – LINES IN WHICH WE 
BELIEVE OUR EXPERTISE ENABLES US TO 
SEE THE DIFFERENCE. 
OPERATING PLATFORM
Our efficient, flexible and scaleable  
operating platform
Related KPIs: Ratio of front office employees to back  
 office employees 159.8% 
Our operating platform, comprising both our underwriting 
platform and our operational infrastructure, is one of our 
key differentiators. We intend to preserve this advantage by 
maintaining the simplicity and efficiency of our platform and 
this remains at the core of our strategy. 
Our Lloyd’s underwriting platform gives us a significant 
operational advantage through premium and asset 
leverage. Our premium and asset leverage is driven by 
our focus on specialty insurance and our decision to return 
to writing solely on the highly capital efficient Lloyd’s 
platform. This means we can sustain strong returns on 
NTA, despite the current challenging rate and the low 
yield environments, while still maintaining prudent capital 
buffers. This also allows us to compete with new forms 
of capital and more traditional capacity while producing 
sector-leading returns.
Our underwriting platform is supported by an operational 
infrastructure where rigorous cost discipline is enforced. 
The scalability of our business is supported by the use 
of outsourcing for a number of business processing, 
support services and IT functions. This strategy allows us to 
distribute our products globally, through a mixture of open 
market business and delegated underwriting, in a more 
cost and capital-efficient manner, as we source business in 
Lloyd’s directly as well as via our local service companies in 
the US and Bermuda.
GROUP RETURN
Value creation and shareholder return

Our key objective is to deliver attractive long-term

differentiating Lloyd’s platform and leading global 
specialty franchise to deliver the best products and 
service to our clients.
Underpinning our key objective to deliver value creation and 
shareholder return is a focus on five strategic priorities that 
are central to our business: 
1. an efficient, flexible and scalable platform; 
2. profitable underwriting; 
3. opportunity-driven growth; 
4. diversified and dynamic investment management; 
5. proactive capital management.
We measure our progress against our strategic priorities by

Achieve long-term and sustainable  
profitable underwriting
Related KPIs: Combined ratio 89.5%
We are six years into a strategy to develop a leading global 
specialty franchise. The results of our efforts are clearly 
demonstrated in our improved attritional loss ratio while 
the repositioning initiatives have demonstrated our focus 
on international specialty insurance. In the longer-term 
we believe the core skill sets of specialist underwriting 
knowledge and claims expertise which we have attracted 
into our business will deliver value to clients and allow us to 
deliver strong underwriting results for shareholders.
We manage the dynamics of the insurance cycle by operating 
a balanced and diverse mix of specialty insurance and reinsurance 
classes, which are reviewed regularly against prevailing market 
conditions and to identify new opportunities. We insure highly 
complex risks and our leadership positions in key Lloyd’s 
classes, experienced underwriters and long-term broker and 
client relationships will enable us to continue to offer innovative 
products in core and niche lines, increase our global relevance 
and provide a platform for product innovation going forward.
While the current market conditions are challenging, 
the direct specialty business on which we focus our 
underwriting, has been more resilient. Alongside our 
strong risk management of catastrophe exposures, we will 
continue to deliver our objective of strong underwriting 
profitability with controlled volatility.

profitable growth
Related KPIs: Combined ratio 89.5% 
We aim to capitalise on attractive growth opportunities as 
they arise but will only do so if we are convinced they will 
be profitable for the Group and if they are complementary 
to our existing portfolio and platform. As a specialty insurer 
we aim to grow in the specialty classes in which Lloyd’s and 
the London market have major or leading positions globally 
and we expect to achieve this by continuing to attract top 
talent and supporting innovation of new products. 
We also look to grow our specialty offering internationally 
through our international service company distribution 
network in mature markets such as the US and Bermuda 
and in emerging economies such as Asia and Latin 
America. These growth opportunities will inevitably depend 
on market conditions and will be opportunity-driven in 
nature, but the majority will continue to be aligned to our 
specialty products in property, energy and casualty.
INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT
Diversified and dynamic investment  
management
Related KPIs: Investment return 2.9% 
We proactively manage our investment portfolio to 
generate attractive risk adjusted returns.
Proactive asset allocation, both strategic and tactical, 
enables us to optimise the risk-adjusted return on our 
portfolio. Our investment strategy differentiates us because 
we take a more balanced approach to generate yield by 
investing across a diverse mix of asset classes with the focus 
predominantly on income-generating assets, from which 
we aim to deliver a stable underlying earnings stream. Our 
in-house investment team proactively manage duration, 
liquidity and foreign exchange exposures to maximise risk-
adjusted returns. Our investment performance produces a 
compelling contribution to our overall RoNTA. 
CAPITAL MANAGEMENT
Proactive capital management
Related KPIs: Capital ratio 150.4%
We aim to maintain a strong capital position while 
delivering a sustainable and regular dividend.
We will achieve this by actively managing risk and allocation 
of capital within the Group and we are committed to 
maximising returns for shareholders over the long-term, 
while maintaining a strong balance sheet and capital 
position. We believe carrying a healthy capital buffer is 
appropriate in our business as it allows us both to absorb 
losses and to pursue profitable growth opportunities while 
underpinning an attractive and consistent dividend for 
shareholders. We believe that any excess capital in the 
business should be returned to shareholders if no attractive 
opportunities to deploy that capital are available. 12     Brit PLC  Annual Report 2014
BUSINESS MODEL
FOLLOWING OUR TRANSFORMATION OF 
THE BUSINESS OVER THE LAST SIX YEARS, 
WE NOW OPERATE A SIMPLIFIED AND 
HIGHLY EFFICIENT BUSINESS MODEL, 
WHICH WE BELIEVE IS BEST PLACED TO 
DELIVER OUR STRATEGIC PRIORITIES. 
OUR OPERATING PLATFORM
AT BRIT OUR OPERATING PLATFORM AND CAPITAL 
MANAGEMENT PHILOSOPHY IS A KEY DIFFERENTIATOR.
Our decision to focus on specialty lines and to trade solely on 
the Lloyd’s platform give us a significant advantage in terms 
of premium leverage and maintaining our capital strength by 
benefiting from the strong Lloyd’s rating.
Our head office is in London. We have service company 
operations in the US and Bermuda and have a representative 
office in Japan. Our syndicate is also represented on the 
Lloyd’s China platform. The key to our efficiency is that all 
premiums are written into Syndicate 2987 while we also benefit 
from further efficiencies afforded by our captive reinsurer in 
Gibraltar. 
Our focus on Lloyd’s and our utilisation of the service 
company model enables us to operate cost efficiently and 
with significant flexibility. Our back office is operated out of 
our London corporate headquarters with support from our 
outsourcing partner, offering scalable IT and operational 
capability. This model means we do not have to recreate 
finance, actuarial and risk capabilities in every jurisdiction in 
which we operate and that we do not have to hold capital 
locally. In 2014, these efficiencies are illustrated by 
our premium leverage described above and the premium per 
head we achieved in London (£3.1m) and in our local offices 
(£2.1m).
The combination of these factors means we can operate  
with flexibility, enabling genuine portfolio management 
unhindered by expense drag or trapped capital. The business 
is run how a specialty insurer fundamentally should be: able 
to quickly respond to market conditions to generate strong 
returns across differing pricing and market conditions.
Our 466 talented and experienced employees have built 
strong and significant long-term relationships with our clients, 
brokers and service providers over time, that allow us access 
to attractive opportunities for profitable growth. Our nimble 
and flexible structure allows us to move quickly to capitalise 
on these opportunities, as we seek to maximise value creation 
for all our stakeholders.
We have actively repositioned our business model to put our 
Lloyd’s platform at the centre of what we do and we are proud 
to be the largest insurance group trading solely on the Lloyd’s 
of London platform. This structure provides us with a capital 
efficient model, a significant operational advantage, financial 
strength, funding flexibility and enhanced distribution.  
Our underwriting approach is focused on a diverse mix  
of complex, high-value specialty insurance business mainly 
across property, energy and casualty lines while we have 
a differentiating and dynamic investment management 
approach that enables us to optimise the risk-adjusted  
return on our assets.  Brit PLC  Annual Report 2014     13     
STRATEGIC REPORT
UNDERWRITING  
WE WRITE £1.3BN OF SPECIALTY INSURANCE AND 
REINSURANCE PREMIUMS. OUR UNDERWRITING  
BUSINESS MODEL IS CENTRED ON OUR LLOYD’S 
PLATFORM AND OUR INTERNATIONAL DISTRIBUTION 
NETWORK WHICH HAS PRODUCED STRONG UNDER-
WRITING PROFITABILITY FOR THE LAST FIVE YEARS. 
We distribute our products globally through brokers and 
place significant emphasis on maintaining strong, open 
and supportive long-term relationships with them. Our 
international network of service companies also allows us to 
increase client engagement and access business which would 
not usually be underwritten at Lloyd’s, while maintaining the 
capital efficiencies of a Lloyd’s platform. Over the past few 
years our focus has been on expanding our international 
footprint, particularly in the US.
The bulk of our underwriting portfolio (81.2% in 2014) is 
specialty insurance, where we provide specialist, complex 
products and support to clients. Our reinsurance portfolio 
complements this with a more opportunity-driven strategy 
dependent on market conditions. We believe this balance 
of insurance versus reinsurance gives us greater exposure 
to lines where technical knowledge and underwriting 
experience are most highly valued and therefore where we 
can offer maximum value to clients and shareholders. Brit has 
a strong reputation within the Lloyd’s market for providing a 
leading underwriting capability that allows us to access the 
best opportunities available across the market and continue 
to strengthen our franchise.
We manage our overall net exposures to catastrophes and 
man-made risks actively through the purchase of various 
forms of reinsurance on quota share, excess of loss and 
aggregate bases. Combined with our diverse portfolio of 
underwriting risks and our prudent approach to line size 
management, this approach has resulted in reduced volatility 
in our underwriting profitability in recent years. 
Our claims service is an integral part of the overall 
underwriting offering and one of the key market-facing parts 
of our business. We write a broad range of complex risks 
and we recognise that brokers and clients require efficient 
settlement of claims, clear communication and expert 
support through the settlement process. Our reputation for 
the way in which we handle often very complex claims can be 
a key factor in attracting and retaining business. 
Our claims team works closely with our underwriters,  
in-house legal function and external service providers and 
experts through the life cycle of a claim to provide the best 
possible service. The use of outsourced service providers 
is an important component of our claims operating model. 
We manage these arrangements through a well-defined 
governance model that includes clear service standards and 
limits of authority, supported by a structured programme of 
review and independent third-party audit. 
We aim to process and pay claims promptly, professionally 
and with integrity, keeping customers well informed and 
treating them fairly at all times.
INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT
OUR INVESTED ASSETS OF £2.6BN ARE OVERSEEN  
BY AN EXPERIENCED INTERNAL TEAM AND APART FROM 
A SMALL SELF-MANAGED PORTFOLIO, ARE MANAGED 
BY HIGH-QUALITY EXTERNAL MANAGERS. THIS ALLOWS 
US TO DRAW ON A BROAD RANGE OF EXPERTISE 
ACROSS A NUMBER OF ASSET CLASSES AND SECTORS. 
THESE MANAGERS ACT WITHIN A WELL-DEFINED RISK 
FRAMEWORK AND CONTROL ENVIRONMENT THAT 
CONTAINS INVESTMENT GUIDELINES DETERMINED BY 
ASSET CLASS.
Our asset portfolio targets a core of income generating 
investments (88.2% at 31 December 2014), supplemented 
by an allocation to growth assets across a range of sectors 
to balance risk and yield. We seek to achieve this mix while 
remaining broadly matched to currency exposure and with 
sufficient liquidity even in extreme stress scenarios. 
The combination of our focus on specialty lines insurance 
and our utilisation of the efficient Lloyd’s capital structure 
gives us significant asset leverage equivalent to 3.7 times our 
adjusted net tangible assets at 31 December 2014, after our 
recommended dividends. 14     Brit PLC  Annual Report 2014
BUSINESS MODEL
THE ADVANTAGES OF OPERATING  
A LLOYD’S-BASED PLATFORM 
Efficient platform
The Lloyd’s capital model affords all members, including Brit, 
the benefit of favourable capital requirements compared to 
similarly rated non-Lloyd’s entities. As such, we are able to 
maintain a strong capital surplus and write a higher volume 
of premium relative to that capital base compared to non-
Lloyd’s market participants, allowing us to generate a higher 
return on capital. 
Financial backing and rating strength
Lloyd’s financial security and strong ratings (A+ (strong) from 
Standard & Poor’ s; A (excellent) from A.M. Best; and AA- (very 
strong) from Fitch Ratings) enable the Lloyd’ s market to attract 
diverse and specialist insurance business on a global basis.
Distribution capability
Lloyd’ s has global distribution reach with direct or reinsurance 
licensing in over 200 territories and operational hubs in key 
international markets. This provides us with low-cost access 
to new business opportunities in international mature and 
emerging markets. 
Brand strength
Lloyd’s has an established global brand and is a leading 
participant in global specialty insurance and reinsurance. 
In particular, Lloyd’s has the largest share of the $38bn US 
surplus lines market. 
Funding flexibility
Lloyd’s affords greater flexibility in funding capital 
requirements compared to stand-alone insurance companies 
as Lloyd’ s members can support their underwriting capacity 
using letters of credit and/or bank guarantees. Brit uses 
letters of credit prudently to meet part of its funding 
requirement. 
Infrastructure and service support
Lloyd’s provides members with various central services, 
including the infrastructure supporting the subscription 
market, tax and regulatory reporting. 
Barriers to entry
Lloyd’s, through its membership-based participation model, 
has higher barriers to entry than the broader non-life property 
and casualty insurance market. Memberships are approved 
by the Council of Lloyd’s and applicants are required to 
satisfy a range of admission criteria before such membership 
is granted. This includes business plans being subjected to 
scrutiny and approval by Lloyd’s. 
Further details of the Lloyd’s market and how it operates can 
be found at www.Lloyds.com.
MARKET CONDITIONS
CHALLENGING MARKET CONDITIONS PERSIST 
Their impact has been felt by all participants as a number of factors have led to pressure on insurance rates and investment 
performance. These include increasing levels of new capital in the insurance and reinsurance markets from traditional and 
non-traditional participants as well as increasingly unpredictable global geopolitical environment, a record low investment 
yield environment and uncertain economic prospects. Like all (re)insurers, we are impacted by market conditions but we 
believe our specialty strategy makes our business more resilient to such pressures and enables us to continue to generate 
attractive returns for our shareholders.
Brit is in a unique position as the largest Lloyd’s-only insurance business, with a proven track record over the past four years of 
delivering sector-leading returns through our strong underwriting, differentiating investment strategy and efficient platform. 
In the event of more difficult claims or investment environments, Brit has the capital strength and the strong risk management 
capability to navigate these conditions. As a result we are confident that our strategy and business model are well-positioned 
to create long-term value for our clients and shareholders. PRODUCT INNOVATION
Cyber attack cover
In response to the rising cyber threat, we have developed a unique and innovative insurance 
service to protect companies operating critical infrastructure and industrial machinery from 
terrorist and other malicious attacks, such as sabotage, espionage and theft. The cyber attack 
cover brings to the market a unique product offering that has been developed by a highly 
experienced team at Brit in partnership with Coalfire (an independent expert in cyber risk). 
Alongside the support of our consortium partners we have capacity of US$350.0m per risk, 
offering significant new protection and support to clients in this complex area of emerging risk..

KEY PERFORMANCE 
INDICATORS
AT BRIT WE MONITOR AND MEASURE 
OUR PERFORMANCE BY REFERENCE TO 
CERTAIN KEY PERFORMANCE INDICATORS 
(KPIs). THESE KPIs ARE USED BY US TO 
MANAGE OUR BUSINESS AND ALLOW 
OUR STAKEHOLDERS TO SEE AT A GLANCE 
HOW WE ARE PERFORMING AGAINST OUR 
OBJECTIVES AND OUR COMPETITORS.
Our six KPIs are linked to our strategic priorities and show 
the returns that we are generating for our stakeholders, the 
performance of our underwriting activities, the performance 
of our investment portfolio, our financial strength and our 
efficient, flexible and scalable platform.
In 2011, we initiated a major repositioning of our business, 
refocusing on a simpler and more efficient model. We believe 
that our four-year track record is a strong indicator of the 
progress we have made so far.
Definitions of each of our KPIs 
are included in the Glossary 
starting on page 219. 
Performance-related 
remuneration, which includes  
the Group bonus plan and  
share incentive plans, is

RETURN ON NET TANGIBLE ASSETS BEFORE FX MOVEMENTS AND IPO COSTS (RoNTA)
Strategic priority: deliver long-term value creation and shareholder return 
Return on net tangible assets before 
foreign exchange movements and 
IPO costs (RoNTA) shows the return 
being generated by our operations 
compared to the adjusted net tangible 
assets deployed in our business. 
In a year with average levels of major 
claims we target a RoNTA in the mid-
teens range.
In 2014 we delivered a RoNTA of 
20.7% driven by excellent performance 
across all areas of the business. 
Strong underlying underwriting results 
were supported by limited losses 
from natural catastrophes and our 
investment return (net of fees) of 2.9%. 
Our track record over the past four 
years has been very strong with 
significant outperformance of our 
global peers in both severe and benign 
catastrophe years.

The total value created measures the 
increase in adjusted NTA (including 
distributions) in a year. It reflects 
the after tax result recorded in the 
income statement and all other value 
movements.
In 2014 value creation was £139.2m 
or 21.1% of opening adjusted NTA. 
The company has now generated a 
total value of £451.2m over the past 
four years, an average of £112.8m per 
annum.

STRATEGIC REPORT
COMBINED RATIO
Strategic priorities: profitable underwriting; opportunity-driven profitable growth
The combined ratio is our key 
underwriting metric and measures 
the profitability of our underwriting. 
It shows how much of every £1 of 
premium is spent in the total costs of 
sourcing and underwriting the business 
and settling claims. A combined ratio 
under 100% indicates underwriting 
profitability.
In a year with average levels of major 
claims, we target a combined ratio in 
the low to mid 90% range. In a year 
with low levels of major claims, the 
ratio would be expected to fall to the 
high 80% range.
In line with our guidance, our 
combined ratio in 2014 was 89.5%, 
reflecting excellent underwriting 
performance in difficult market 
conditions. We have consistently 
delivered combined ratios below  
100% over the past four years and  
an average ratio of 91.5% over  
that period.

RATIO OF FRONT OFFICE EMPLOYEES TO BACK OFFICE EMPLOYEES
Strategic priority: efficient flexible and scalable operating platform
This measure monitors the efficiency 
of our business model by comparing 
the number of front office client-facing 
revenue generators and service 
providers to the number of back office 
employees. An increase in the ratio 
would suggest that the back office is 
becoming more efficient in supporting 
the client-facing activities of the front 
office. 
We have monitored this ratio since 
2013 following the restructuring of the 
Group. At 31 December 2014, the ratio 
was 159.8%, reflecting that we had  
1.6 front office employees for every 
one back office employee.

CAPITAL RATIO

The capital ratio measures the strength

the capital we need to hold to meet 
our management entity capital 
requirements.
We target a capital ratio within a range 
of 120% to 140%.
At 31 December 2014, the ratio was 
150.4% and as such, the Board is 
recommending a special dividend 
of £50.1m. Adjusted for this special 
dividend and the recommended final 
ordinary dividend of £50.1m, the ratio 
reduces to 136.0%.

CHAIRMAN’S 
STATEMENT
Dr Richard Ward
Chairman
2014 HAS BEEN A SIGNIFICANT YEAR FOR BRIT. 
STRATEGICALLY WE HAVE MADE ENCOURAGING 
PROGRESS IN DELIVERING OUR AMBITION TO BECOME 
THE LEADING GLOBAL SPECIALTY INSURER. FINANCIALLY, 
OUR UNDERWRITING, INVESTMENT AND OPERATIONAL 
PERFORMANCE ALL CONTRIBUTED TO AN EXCELLENT 
RONTA OF 20.7%. MOST IMPORTANTLY, 2014 SAW BRIT’S 
SUCCESSFUL RETURN TO THE MARKET FOLLOWING OUR 
INITIAL PUBLIC OFFERING (IPO) OF 25% OF THE COMPANY 
IN APRIL. 
Our return to the market was met with significant investor 
interest and I see this as pleasing recognition of the major 
transformation our business has achieved over the past six 
years and the strong track record of professionalism and 
performance that we have built over that time. This is thanks 
to the hard work and dedication of our employees and the 
support and trust of our clients and shareholders. Having been 
CEO of Lloyd’s for eight years, until the end of 2013, I have 
seen from a distance how much commitment this repositioning 
has taken from all areas of the business and my first-hand 
experience over the 12 months since I joined the Board as 
Chairman has further demonstrated what an exceptional job 
the management team has done. I am confident this is the 
best team to lead the business forward for you. 
Offer from Fairfax
On 17 February 2015, we announced an offer for Brit  
from Fairfax. Brit’s Board was pleased to recommend  
this combination with Fairfax, which I believe will greatly  
assist us in delivering our strategy of building the leading  
global speciality (re)insurer. The proposed deal provides an  
exciting opportunity to deliver our growth ambitions. Our  
simple and capital-efficient Lloyd’s focused platform make  
us an attractive partner for Fairfax and our shared values in  
underwriting discipline, speciality lines focus, operational 
rigour and meticulous claims management make this 
transaction a compelling proposition for all stakeholders.  
The offer represents a strong result for all our shareholders  
and produces attractive financial returns following our 
successful IPO in April 2014. 
Performance 
Our key differentiators are our focused Lloyd’s platform, our 
underwriting strategy and our investment strategy. We have 
made good progress against all of our strategic priorities in 
2014 and delivered the targets we set at the time of the IPO. 
In underwriting, we have reported an excellent combined 
ratio of 89.5% underpinned by another year of attractive 
attritional loss ratio performance. We have also developed our 
international capabilities by delivering profitable growth in  
our US platform, which is now reaching significant scale, as 
well as our specialist Bermudian operations. In investments, 
our dynamic and active strategy continues to set us apart 
from our peers, with a decision to focus on income generating 
assets across a broad range of asset classes, generating 
another year of outperformance, with a return of 2.9%, well 
above investment benchmarks.
Capital advantages
The Brit business model remains simple but very effective. 
Our decision to focus our capital solely on the Lloyd’s platform 
creates excellent capital efficiency, and our strict approach to 
cost control allows us to operate a flexible and scalable model  Brit PLC  Annual Report 2014     19     
STRATEGIC REPORT
across the business. This platform has enabled us to deliver 
attractive returns (20.7% in 2014) despite challenging market 
conditions and to maintain a strong balance sheet, pursue 
growth opportunities and to support a consistent dividend 
for shareholders. I am delighted that we have delivered an 
ordinary dividend of 18.75p per share for 2014 and a further 
special dividend of 12.5p, driven by this year’s excellent result 
and our rigorous capital management strategy. 
Brit strategy and outlook
Looking forward, the financial landscape in which the 
insurance industry operates continues to offer material 
challenges. Exceptionally low interest rates, geopolitical 
uncertainty, global growth concerns and market volatility mean 
that the industry continues to face a testing back drop. For 
the insurance industry capital availability is increasing from 
both traditional and non-traditional sources and we expect 
this to create further competition and pressure on pricing and 
conditions in 2015. These new forms of capital, along with 
evolving distribution channels and constant improvements 
in technology continue to challenge industry norms and as 
a Board we will be mindful as to how we can react to this 
landscape quickly and drive the Brit and industry agenda. 
I absolutely believe that we have the right platform and 
business mix to deliver sector-leading returns for shareholders 
in this challenging insurance rate and low yield environment. 
However, to maintain strong profitability, we must focus more 
than ever on our underwriting discipline, risk selection and 
capital management. Integral to this is maintaining good 
relationships with brokers, clients, cover holders and most 
importantly our regulators. 
Brit is in a unique position as the largest Lloyd’s-only insurance 
business and we plan to develop this business by continuing 
to invest in our people, by attracting top talent and by 
supporting the innovation of new products to meet our clients’ 
needs. We also plan to build out our global distribution 
capability selectively, with significant opportunities to grow 
in mature markets such as the US and Bermuda, where we 
have achieved critical mass and expect to capitalise further 
on our investments in 2015. We also see opportunities in key 
growth markets over the longer-term such as building on the 
capability of our Latin America team in Miami and growing our 
presence in China.
We expect 2015 to be another difficult year for the insurance 
industry but we remain committed to delivering our goal of 
mid-teen RoNTA for our shareholders. We have the capital 
strength and exceptional talent within our business to navigate 
these demanding conditions and to continue to innovate and 
take advantage of opportunities for incremental growth as 
and when they arise. I look back at 2014 with immense pride 
at what has been achieved and I look forward with confidence 
and realism that we have the platform and the people to 
deliver strong returns for shareholders.
Finally, I express my sincere appreciation to the Board, the 
executive and all the staff at Brit for their contribution and for 
their ongoing commitment to delivering our strategy and for 
helping the business take another significant step forward to 
becoming the leading global specialty insurer.

CHIEF EXECUTIVE  
OFFICER’S REPORT
Mark Cloutier 
Chief Executive Officer
2014 HAS BEEN A LANDMARK YEAR FOR BRIT, MARKING 
OUR RETURN AS A PUBLICLY LISTED COMPANY AND 
DELIVERING ANOTHER STRONG SET OF RESULTS,  
A SIGNIFICANT ACHIEVEMENT GIVEN THE SHIFTING 
MARKET DYNAMICS. SINCE OUR DECISION TO 
REPOSITION THE BUSINESS, WE HAVE RELENTLESSLY 
FOCUSED ON DEVELOPING A PLATFORM THAT IS 
ALIGNED WITH OUR KEY OBJECTIVE OF LONG-
TERM VALUE CREATION WHILE RETAINING A HIGHLY 
DISCIPLINED APPROACH TO THE BUSINESS WE CHOOSE 
TO UNDERWRITE IN THE SHORT -TERM. 
Our model allows us to ‘see the difference’ and our recent 
track record is a strong vindication of what we have set out 
to achieve. It also gives us a clear path to deliver our key 
business objective: to maximise long-term value creation for 
shareholders by leveraging our differentiating Lloyd’s-only 
platform and leading global specialty franchise to deliver the 
best insurance solutions to complex risks faced by our clients.
We closed the year with healthy growth in our business and 
delivered very strong total value creation of £139.2m with a 
20.7% return on net tangible assets (excluding FX and IPO 
costs); our third year in a row of sector-leading returns in 
excess of 18.5%. The results discussed in this, our first annual 
report since our IPO, are a credit to the entire Brit team. They 
have worked tirelessly throughout the year, staying focused  
on the fundamentals that we consider key to generating long-
term shareholder value and ensuring that our clients always 
see the difference in partnering with Brit.
We were very pleased to announce on 17 February 2015 
an offer for the business from Fairfax. Our business is 
complementary to the Fairfax group’s current offering and 
the deal represents an exciting opportunity for us to continue 
our story on an even stronger footing, for the benefit of both 
companies, our employees, customers and trading partners. 
It will give Brit access to Fairfax’s existing relationships and 
expertise in the international insurance and reinsurance 
markets, allowing us to enhance our global product offering. 
Financial highlights 
In 2014, we delivered against the targets set out at the time 
of the IPO and continue to capitalise on profitable growth 
opportunities.
• We continue to create value for our stakeholders. In spite 
of challenging market conditions we have produced 
a RoNTA of 20.7% and the total value we created was 
£139.2m. Underwriting and investment performance both 
contributed to this result;
• Our underwriting operations generated a profit of £102.0m 
and produced a combined ratio of 89.5%.
 – Our premium growth of 9.8% (15.0% at constant rates 
of exchange), is driven by new business from the new 
teams and initiatives put in place from 2012 to 2014.  
We have also seen organic growth in a few selected  
lines where rating conditions remain attractive such as 
US binder business and some other specialty classes;
 – The overall risk-adjusted trend in pricing is a decrease of 
2.9%, which is in line with our projection at the time of 
the IPO and our guidance repeated at half year. The price 
falls in treaty reinsurance were marked and occurred early 
in the year as the bulk of our reinsurance book renews in 
the first six months. The insurance business pricing was 
more resilient with an overall decrease in rates of 1.6%, 
justifying our strategy to focus on insurance business 
where our expertise is highly valued. While we are not 
alone in experiencing rating declines, we are happy with 
the rating adequacy of our overall portfolio;
 – Our claims experience has been in line with expectation 
and, while we have sustained some losses from natural 
catastrophes (e.g. Hurricane Odile) and man-made events 
(e.g. the Tripoli airport attack), the claims environment has 
been benign. Our attritional claims experience and the 
development of our prior year reserves have been in line 
with the guidance offered at the time of our IPO. Brit PLC  Annual Report 2014     21     
STRATEGIC REPORT
• We have generated investment return net of fees ahead 
of our guidance at 2.9% and have benefited from falling 
yields and the tightening of credit spreads that have driven 
unrealised gains in our government and corporate credit 
weighted portfolios. We have shortened the duration of  
our portfolio in a defensive move against expected interest 
rate rises and we therefore believe we are well-positioned 
for 2015;
• We are well capitalised with resources amounting to 
150.4% of the capital we need to meet regulatory 
requirements. As indicated at the time of our IPO, we are 
and will continue to be active managers of our capital and, 
in line with our guidance, will make a special dividend of 
£50.1m to bring our surplus position back to the upper end  
of the 120% to 140% range;
• In 2014, we successfully completed the commutation 
of a portfolio reinsurance transaction relating to the 
restructuring of the Group in 2012. We are pleased to 
have commuted on favourable terms, bringing closure 
on a portfolio of long-tail liability reserves including those 
related to the financial crisis. This transaction marked the 
final element of the major restructuring of the business 
undertaken since 2011 by Brit’s new management. 
Focus on the fundamentals
At Brit we focus on five core fundamentals that drive 
our overarching business objective: continuing to take 
advantage of our differentiating Lloyd’s-only operating 
platform; delivering sustainable and profitable underwriting 
performance (which includes the claims component of our 
business); focused growth; dynamic asset management; and 
strong capital management. While we discuss all of these in 
some detail elsewhere in this Strategic Report, I will provide 
some additional perspective here.
Underwriting
Underwriting profitability lies at the heart of our strategy. 
Evidence of that commitment is seen not only in this year’ s very 
strong claims ratio but in the reduction in our attritional loss 
ratio over the last five years, as shown in the graph above.
Under Matthew Wilson’s leadership, in what can best be 
described as a challenging environment, underwriting 
performance of £1,302.1m premium income and a claims 
ratio of 50.0% again proved the wisdom of writing a 
diversified portfolio of specialty classes. We saw good 
top line growth in 2014, predominantly from new teams 
and initiatives, however we continue to maintain a highly 
disciplined approach to organic growth, particularly given 
market conditions and outlook. 
In volatile market conditions, the ability to draw on underwriting 
experience, sophisticated technical pricing tools and long-term 
trading relationships to grow or reduce exposures depending 
upon terms and conditions available by business class, is critical 
to optimising shareholder returns. Over the past six years we 
have consistently enhanced our product set, as well as the skills 
of our underwriting community. As a result, we were very well 
positioned to meet the challenges of the market conditions 
we faced in 2014 – and will continue to see going forward. 
Matthew goes into more detail on performance and outlook in 
our underwriting review on page 26.
The London market should be a centre of innovation: offering 
products that are responsive to new and emerging forms of 
risk. We believe the best response to excess capacity is to 
create demand through the development of new products for 
emerging needs, rather than allowing that excess capacity to 
cause us to give away our margins. 
Brit set an excellent example of such innovation in 2014 with 
the roll-out of our new cyber-attack cover – targeted at first 
party physical damage and business interruption loss arising

In spite of the challenging

’ 22     Brit PLC  Annual Report 2014
from a cyber-attack. We are proud of this development for 
several reasons:
• For 325 years the London market has been a place of 
innovation in the specialty insurance sector. As a firm that 
sells itself as a Lloyd’s-based specialty insurance business, 
this major innovation from Brit makes a clear statement 
about the continued relevance and importance of the 
London market;
• The success of this initiative will again prove the need  
for – and importance of – a syndicated market for the  
placement of complex and new forms of risk, whereby 
products can be developed and enhanced through a 
broad distribution of those risks across different forms  
of capacity providers;
• The product development work by the Brit team is 
tangible evidence of our talent, collaboration and intent. 
Furthermore, the support of the market resulting in excess 
of US$350m of consortia capacity clearly reinforces Brit as  
a leader in the development of specialty products.
In tandem with our underwriting performance, delivery of  
a first class accurate claims service to our clients is key to our 
success. During the year we continued to strengthen our  
claims offering with a number of new hires, deepening our skill 
set and expanding the experience base in support of the new 
initiatives we implemented. We have also led innovation within 
the claim side of the business through the introduction of a 
fast track arbitration clause that will greatly enhance the client’s 
experience on complex issues, with a more cost effective and 
robust solution to potential conflict points. This is unique to 
Brit and has been well received in the market.
Looking ahead, we expect that trading conditions in some 
classes will continue to be challenging. However, we believe  
we have the diversity in our portfolio, the cross-class expertise, 
the discipline and the trading relationships that will enable us to 
continue driving strong returns through shifting market cycles.
Focused growth
As a specialty (re)insurer we look to grow in two principal  
ways. First, in the specialty classes in which Lloyd’ s and the 
London market have a major and or leading presence. Secondly, 
through opportunity-driven geographic growth in specialty 
classes where we have expertise – in both mature and 
emerging markets including the US, China and Latin America.
2014 saw 15.0% growth in our top line GWP at constant  
FX rates. This was driven by our specialty insurance 
business which grew by 22.4%, while we chose to shrink our 
reinsurance portfolio by 8.1% in response to difficult market 
conditions. The growth we achieved in our book was driven 
predominantly by new underwriting initiatives implemented 
in 2013 and 2014, which included the addition of property 
and public entity specialty teams in the US, a casualty and 
property treaty team in Bermuda and a number of specialist 
class teams in London (high value homeowners, aviation, 
political  and credit risks, and fine art and specie). Growth in 
our existing business was limited as we remained disciplined. 
This growth was focused on areas where rates have been most 
resilient and specifically our US property binder business and 
US specialty classes.
Our growth has been described as being ‘opportunistic’ and 
we agree with that view. Our approach is first to consider any 
opportunity within the context of our overall strategy and our 
basic understanding of the product offering to ensure it fits 
with our longer-term plan. We then examine historical results 
very closely and model the business in our own structure. 
This ensures we fully understand the capital implications, 
aggregation and correlation issues and expense impact. We 
only proceed if we fully understand the class and the business 
meets all our criteria – including a very high probability of 
achieving a profitable run rate within its first 12 months. 
CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER’S REPORT Brit PLC  Annual Report 2014     23     
STRATEGIC REPORT
This disciplined approach means we turn away many more 
‘opportunities’ than we actually take on. Matthew provides 
more detail on specific initiatives in the Underwriting Review.
Given our capital structure and highly competitive expense 
model, it is important to remember that we are under no 
pressure to write new or unfamiliar premium (exposure);  
this is particularly important given the current challenging 
market conditions.
Given current market conditions and the effect of rate 
movements, we expect the impact of the various initiatives to 
deliver a low to mid-single digit growth rate for Brit over the 
next few years.
Investment management 
An important part of our strategy is to optimise the risk-
adjusted return on our asset portfolio within the context of the 
responsibilities of a property and casualty insurance business. 
Under John Stratton’s leadership our result in 2014 is a good 
example of the effectiveness of that strategy.
Invested assets under management amounted to £2.6bn at 
the end of 2014 (2013: £2.6bn), with investment return net  
of fees for the year ahead of expectations at 2.9%, or £75.7m 
(2013: 2.1%, or £54.7m).
At 31 December 2014, 88.2% of the Group’s investment 
portfolio was invested in cash and income generating 
assets. Over 70.0% of our invested assets corresponded 
to cash, government bonds and investment grade credit. 
A small proportion (11.8%) of the portfolio is allocated to 
growth assets where investment is targeted at lower volatility 
alternative and equity strategies.
During 2014, the duration and credit risk in the portfolio  
was actively managed through portfolio rebalancing. This, 
together with the ability of our growth strategies to manage 
periods of market volatility enhanced our performance and,  
in particular, risk-adjusted returns over the year. 
While the macro-economic environment remains challenging, 
we believe our investment portfolio is appropriately  
positioned for a persistently slow global recovery and the 
prospect of changing monetary policy in different regions. 
With our established and flexible operating platform we 
remain well placed to actively manage our duration and  
sector profile as the market backdrop develops, accessing 
attractive investments as risk/reward opportunities arise.
Operating platform
A key element in long-term value creation is to position  
the Company with an efficient and scalable operating platform. 
Over the past four years we have developed a model that 
enables us to operate on a very competitive operating 
expense ratio. In 2014 our operating expense ratio was 
stable at 12.0% (2013: 12.0%). We monitor controllable 
expenses closely and work hard to ensure that discretionary 
spending is targeted at improving business performance, 
both for our shareholders and our trading partners.
While we manage expenses carefully, we recognise that 
both people and systems are critical to maintaining a 
competitive advantage for a specialty business. In 2014 we:
• Rolled-out major upgrades to our core underwriting system 
and financial ledger system;
• Significantly enhanced our technical pricing tools and 
made major improvements to our data warehouse and 
management information capabilities;
• Committed substantial resources to enhancing the skills of 
our people. Nearly 300 members of our team participated 
in more than 580 days of educational and training time.  
Our objective is simple: to have the most qualified and 
skilled people working with the best technical tools available.
‘
The product development work by 
the Brit team is tangible evidence of our 
talent, collaboration and intent.
’ 24     Brit PLC  Annual Report 2014
These investments help empower us with a highly flexible 
business model. Operating an expense-efficient, scalable 
platform gives us greater ability to manage effectively 
through the challenges of market cycles.
Capital management 
Our Lloyd’s-focused business allows us to maintain a  
very strong capital position, while still achieving operating 
ratios that enable us to produce sector-leading returns for our 
shareholders. The capital efficiency embedded in the Lloyd’s 
model – and the operating efficiency we achieve there –  
also enhances our flexibility when dealing with competitive 
pricing pressures and the market impact of lower-cost forms  
of capital. 
We seek to hold actual capital in a range of 120% to 140% 
of our capital requirement and believe holding capital at 
this level enhances our ability to manage our approach to 
opportunity-driven growth, take advantage of positive market 
circumstances arising following major industry losses, and 
support our attractive dividend. Notwithstanding the prudent 
holding of that excess capital, we achieved a 20.7% return 
on net tangible assets for our shareholders this year and 
were able to recommend a final dividend of 12.5p per share 
(£50.1m) taking the total ordinary dividend for the year to 
18.75p per share (£75.1m).
As excess capital builds above our expected range we will 
look for ways to deploy it through growth in the business. As 
we committed to at the time of the IPO, if market conditions 
or a lack of good opportunities suggest growth is not right 
for us, we will return that excess (above our prudent range) to 
our shareholders. This was the case in 2014 where our strong 
results have afforded us additional capital headroom and after 
consideration of the potential capital requirements for 2015 
and growth opportunities we have proposed to pay a special 
dividend of a further 12.5p per share (£50.1m). This takes the 
total payout for the full year to £125.2m/31.25p per share or 
90.1% of 2014 earnings. Our capital buffer at the end of 2014, 
adjusted for these recommended dividends, was 36.0% or 
£251.7m above requirements. Having slightly reduced both 
our maximum catastrophe realistic disaster scenario exposure 
and some of our credit exposures on the investment portfolio 
in the second half of 2014, we believe this is a prudent and 
appropriate level of capital buffer for our business to carry.  
I expect to continue this rigorous capital management policy 
in the future. 
Brit has operated its governance and capital resources on a 
‘Solvency II’ standard internal model for some years and we 
therefore believe we are well positioned to comply with full 
requirements when they become effective from 1 January 2016.
Conclusion and outlook
The results we have achieved this year and the strength of our 
business model is a credit to the entire Brit team. Our people 
are our core asset and everything we achieve is through their 
talent, experience, hard work and commitment. At Brit we 
operate a culture of achievement and involvement where 
we encourage our associates to excel in every aspect of our 
business through experience, training, natural talents and 
importantly, collaboration across business activities.
In each of the past two years we have performed engagement 
surveys to help us understand how our team members view 
our Company, the corporate environment and the behaviour 
of management. I am very happy to report extremely high 
participation levels in both of those surveys with 2014 
participation at 89%.
The surveys provide invaluable feedback on what we are 
doing well and where we have room for improvement. 
Management takes that feedback very seriously and takes 
every effort to continuously improve our work environment 
and culture. I am delighted to report this year we scored very 
well in some key measures or statements. For example, 86%

of employees would recommend Brit as a great place to work 
and 85% of employees are proud to work here.
We believe having a workforce which is very engaged in 
the future of the business sets our Group on a course for 
continued outperformance for many years ahead.
Trading conditions are certainly not getting any easier with 
a continued flow of capital to our market place, a generally 
softening rate environment, and a continuing low yield 
investment environment. Nonetheless we believe we are 
well positioned to face the challenging days ahead with the 
flexibility we have built into our business model through our 
low cost scalable operating platform, our strong yet efficient 
capital structure, our dynamic approach to asset management 
and our opportunity-driven growth strategy. In addition, and 
very importantly given current market trends, we have over the 
past four years shown clear underwriting discipline; it is that 
which has enabled us to reach this stage and we will continue 
to focus on this fundamental which is so core to our business.
I would like to thank every member of the Brit team for their 
commitment and efforts over the past year and congratulate 
them on a great result. My thanks also go to our trading 
partners, brokers, agents, policyholders and cedants for their 
support and friendship as we have continued to develop the 
Brit story together.
Finally, I would like to extend my appreciation to our Board 
of Directors for their encouragement, advice, direction and 
support through what has been a very exciting and successful 
year for our Group.

UNDERWRITING MANAGEMENT AND CULTURE
A culture of underwriting discipline and a robust and 
appropriate underwriting governance framework is at the 
heart of everything we do. Our non-renewal of around 
half of our underwriting portfolio from 2008 to 2012 is 
testament to this approach. 
Our portfolio directors, each of whom is a key component 
of our underwriting management structure, are each 
responsible for a book of business of a size and scale that 
includes business lines at different stages of the insurance 
cycle. This provides the flexibility to move capital between 
business lines to give the best prospect of exploiting any 
market opportunity quickly and efficiently. The management 
structure has been strengthened during 2014, with the appoint-
ment of a deputy active underwriter who is responsible for 
underwriting discipline and performance management.
Underpinning our underwriting culture is the professionalism 
of our staff. Brit Syndicates Limited has Chartered Insurer 
status through the Chartered Insurance Institute (CII) and we 
are committed to continually expanding and supporting our 
staff’s development. Our underwriters are incentivised to 
write for sustainable profit rather than volume, reinforcing 
discipline without excessive risk taking and aligning our 
underwriters’ interests to those of our shareholders. Our 
culture also emphasises placing client interests at the heart 
of our underwriting, paying particular regard to the FCA’s 
six consumer outcomes which focus on the fair treatment  
of customers.
BUSINESS MIX
Portfolio management of pricing cycles and subsequent 
business mix adjustments are central to our underwriting 
philosophy and at Brit we seek to have a balanced, diverse 
portfolio with a focus on our core book, supplemented by 
our diversifying insurance classes and reinsurance.
The mix of business is continually adjusted based on 
market conditions and we seek to optimise our underwriting 
portfolio via a combination of organic growth in profitable 
areas; adding new product lines in profitable niche areas;  
taking defensive positions in sectors where trading conditions 
are not favourable; and maintaining the flexibility to execute  
opportunity-driven growth as prospects present themselves.
Supporting both underwriting discipline and governance 
is a robust pricing framework consisting of an appropriate 
experience rating or predictive modelling tool for each line 
of business, with all risks above certain referral points being 
subject to actuarial review.
UNDERWRITING PHILOSOPHY
Our underwriting philosophy is simple: we have 
developed a best in class specialty underwriting 
team wholly focused on writing a broad mix of 
profitable business. Our Lloyd’s platform gives 
us a significant advantage as the Lloyd’s market 
is a specialist in and leader of complex, short- 
tail property and energy business. We have 
also maintained our position in a broad mix of 
casualty lines and our casualty treaty account 
has consistently outperformed those of our 
peers. In addition, we have enhanced our global 
distribution channel through Lloyd’s, launched  
a number of innovative products and developed 
our professional, customer focused claims 
function.

Underwriting profitability lies at 
the heart of our strategy. Evidence of 
that commitment is seen not only in 
this year’s very strong 50.0% claims

’ Brit PLC  Annual Report 2014     27     
STRATEGIC REPORT
DISTRIBUTION
Our approach to distribution is integral to our underwriting 
strategy and is based on a mixture of open market business, 
delegated underwriting and an established international 
network. 
Open market underwriting 
This has been the principal area of investment in London 
since 2009, through the addition of new underwriting and 
claims teams. Open market business allows our underwriters 
to use their expertise directly in the assessment and 
underwriting of individual risks, enabling careful risk selection 
to target leading profitability.
Delegated underwriting 
We are one of the leading writers of delegated business 
within Lloyd’s. This method of distribution accounted for 
38.0% of our 2014 GWP and provides a cost-efficient way to 
access small to medium-sized risks. We work with selected 
coverholders worldwide to access a spread of business 
in both our short-tail and long-tail portfolios. We have a 
comprehensive governance framework in place including 
a specialist team (Delegated Underwriting Management 
Unit) and a separate oversight committee (Delegated 
Underwriting Management Committee) to ensure that the 
extensive processes and controls are effectively administered 
and adhered to before, during and after the life cycle of a 
contract.
International distribution
We have established a presence in the key (re)insurance 
markets of US, Bermuda, Japan and China to access 
business that would not normally be placed in the London 
market and form closer relationships with a broader range  
of clients and brokers.
Where possible, we have adopted an expense and capital 
efficient service company model to operate in these 
jurisdictions which importantly allows us to maintain all of  
the benefits from operating on the Lloyd’s capital structure, 
while utilising our head office support functions to help 
manage costs.
Our longest established overseas presence is in the US, 
headquartered in Chicago, with nine offices nationwide. 
Since commencing underwriting in 2009, Brit Global 
Specialty USA has delivered measured and profitable growth 
both organically and by adding a number of complementary 
product lines including direct property and package business 
for public entities and criminal justice service organisations.
Our approach to international distribution is built upon 
a philosophy that any new product or office should be 
accretive in the near term. This is demonstrated through  
the recent initiative in Bermuda that contributed £22.0m 
of premiums and £1.6m of underwriting profit in 2014, 
following its establishment in November 2013.
CLAIMS MANAGEMENT
Our claims function is one of the key ‘market facing’ parts  
of our business, with its professionalism and complex  
claims handling experience building a leading reputation. 
The way in which claims are handled by an insurer or 
reinsurer will often determine whether business will be 
renewed and the reputation of the claims function often 
assists in the underwriting of new business. A professional 
claims function will also drive value for the business in its 
handling of claims which in the specialty business will often 
be complex.
In recent years we have made considerable investment in 
enhancing our claims service and have attracted a number 
of experienced new hires into key claims management 
positions. Our claims service has also benefited from the 
upgrade of our core underwriting platform in early 2014  
and from specific investment in technology such as the CTIS-
TRAX system from Charles T aylor Insurance Service Ltd 
which has enhanced our claims workflow processes and 
management information.
Our efficient and professional approach to claims handling 
has been recognised during 2014, with improvements in a 
number of the key Lloyd’s metrics and in external industry 
surveys such as the ‘Gracechurch London Insurers Report’.
Matthew Wilson 
Chief Underwriting Officer 28     Brit PLC  Annual Report 2014
2014 HAS BEEN ANOTHER CHALLENGING YEAR, WITH THE 
(RE)INSURANCE INDUSTRY CONTINUING TO EXPERIENCE  
A SOFTENING CYCLE ACROSS MANY CLASSES OF BUSINESS. 
PREMIUM RATE REDUCTIONS HAVE BEEN BROUGHT 
ABOUT BY LOW LEVELS OF CATASTROPHE ACTIVITY AND 
INCREASED COMPETITION FROM NEW SOURCES OF 
CAPACITY, AS PENSION FUNDS AND MUTUAL FUNDS SEEK 
EXPOSURE TO NON-CORRELATING INVESTMENTS TO 
DIVERSIFY THEIR TRADITIONAL PORTFOLIOS. 
This recent rate pressure has been most severe in our property 
treaty reinsurance business, with rate-reductions in 2014 of 
10.6%, and in property and energy direct open market classes. 
Overall reductions in direct insurance have been much less 
severe than in reinsurance at around 1.6%, with the pressure 
in property and energy offset by resilience in casualty, marine 
and delegated underwriting. Overall rates reduced by 2.9% in 
2014; critically, we are still seeing rate adequacy in many lines 
which should allow target returns on capital to be met. 
In response to these conditions, we have taken a defensive 
position, particularly in our property treaty reinsurance book. 
We have reduced our reinsurance volumes and have focused 
on increasing our specialty business; our portfolio continues 
to re-balance towards short-tail specialty business where we 
believe there is greater rating adequacy.
While our underwriters have displayed excellent discipline 
in the more challenging classes, we still achieved premium 
growth of 9.8% to £1,302.1m in 2014 (15.0% at constant FX 
rates), with weaker lines being offset by growth in our fledgling 
international platforms and business generated by our new 
initiatives and team hires. 
We have also seen a number of opportunities in 2014 for organic 
growth in delegated underwriting, particularly in US property, as 
a more stable rating environment combined with our recognised 
expertise in this area presented several attractive prospects. 
A significant factor in our 2014 growth was the contribution 
from our overseas offices, which have delivered business that 
cannot typically be accessed in London. Brit Global Specialty 
USA (BGSU) has continued to see both organic growth in its 
core product lines and growth in new product lines which 
have been added over the last two years. These new product 
lines include package policies for public non-profit making 
organisations, package policies for adjudicated care providers 
and direct property cover (following the acquisition of renewal 
rights and underwriting staff from Maiden Holdings Ltd in 
2013). BGSU’s strong performance included premium growth 
of 52.2% and an improved CoR of 89.2%. 
2014 was also the first full year for our Bermuda operation 
which has selectively written reinsurance business in lines and 
markets that we believe remain well rated, particularly casualty 
treaty. Premiums generated by our Bermuda office in 2014 
amounted to £22.0m and this office returned an underwriting 
profit in its first full year.
New initiatives that we launched in 2013 have started to 
mature during 2014, with growth in lines such as high value 
homeowners, political and credit risks, and fine art and 
specie. These niche areas currently offer attractive returns and 
complement our existing insurance portfolio. We anticipate 
that these initiatives will continue to grow in 2015.
In June, we demonstrated our appetite for opportunity-
driven growth with the acquisition of the underwriting team 
and renewal rights of QBE’s Lloyd’s based aviation book. By 
acquiring the renewal rights we have been able to bring this 
book to scale immediately and establish a lead position in 
the Lloyd’s market. Similarly in January 2014, we hired a UK 
property team to write a predominantly commercial book that 
will complement our US and international property business. 
Our business is built on our talented underwriting 
professionals and our strong relationships with brokers and 
UNDERWRITING REVIEW Brit PLC  Annual Report 2014     29     
STRATEGIC REPORT
policyholders. During 2014, we have retained our underwriting 
talent and have continued to attract new hires. Our ability 
to lead business, combined with our innovative approach 
to underwriting, supports our success in building long-term 
and dependable market relationships. This is reflected in our 
retention rate, which has increased to 83% from 70% in 2009 
and by us leading, or being second agreement party, on 
approximately 70% of the business we write. This helps us to 
secure favourable rates. 
Our underwriting growth has been supported by investment 
in our claims service, with the number of claims personnel 
increasing by 54.3% since 2009. This ensures a strong service 
to brokers and policyholders, both when underwriting business 
and when processing claims.
During 2014, to further protect the business from the current 
premium rate challenges, we completed a major overhaul of 
our outwards reinsurance protections and took advantage of 
the opportunities presented to a reinsurance purchaser by the 
softening reinsurance market. The significant restructure of our 
catastrophe reinsurance protections, including the purchase 
of a new aggregate protection, has strengthened the level of 
cover at a materially lower risk-adjusted price. This will further 
help us manage the impact of weaker pricing on our inwards 
book, while affording our balance sheet increased protection. 
Additionally, our Lloyd’s syndicate increased the business it 
placed with our Gibraltar-based captive which was in turn 
protected by a new aggregate reinsurance cover.
Overall, the combination of strong portfolio management, 
underwriting discipline and opportunity-driven growth has 
led to us achieving an excellent 89.5% CoR in 2014. While 
catastrophe losses have been low, our attritional loss ratio 
of 51.0% is a testament to the strength of our underwriting 
franchise in the face of competitive pressures. 
Looking ahead to 2015, the market is undoubtedly 
challenging. However, our business model, balanced portfolio, 
growing distribution reach and specialist underwriting 
approach leave us well placed to tackle the headwinds of the 
market rationally and confidently. We expect to continue to 
rebalance our underwriting portfolio in favour of insurance 
and are not afraid to step away from business which does 
not support our target of mid-teen RoNTA in a year with an 
average level of major claims.
We continue to look to enhance our own reinsurance 
protections and for 2015 have secured US$75m of new 
capacity from the capital markets through Versutus Limited,  
a Bermuda based reinsurance vehicle. 
Finally, the new strategic initiatives executed in the last two 
years will continue to bear fruit and our underwriting teams will 
continue to take advantage of opportunities that are aligned 
to our overall Group strategy.

ORGANIC GROWTH & STRATEGIC DEVELOPMENT
Brit Global Specialty USA
Brit Global Specialty USA (BGSU) is one of the fastest-growing areas for Brit, albeit with a 
focus on growing profitably and in niche areas where we already have significant expertise 
and experience. Brit PLC  Annual Report 2014     31     
STRATEGIC REPORT
BRIT GLOBAL SPECIALTY USA 
Market position
Since its inception, BGSU has delivered strong organic 
growth. Over the last two years, a significant strategic 
investment has been made by adding market leading teams 
specialising in packages for public and non-profit entities 
written on a first dollar basis, packages for adjudicated 
care providers and property direct business. In 2014 
premiums have grown 52.2% to £102.0m which equates to 
a compound annual growth rate of 47.1% over the past four 
years. 
We opened an office in Miami during 2014, which is an 
important hub for Latin American business. The Miami office 
will target facultative reinsurance in both Latin America and 
the Caribbean.
At 31 December 2014, BGSU had 61 employees and income 
per head of £1.7m. The combined ratio of BGSU in the 
past four years has been consistently in the low 90% range 
highlighting our focus on making all organic growth and new 
initiatives within the Group accretive in the near term.
Market commentary
The main market of BGSU is specialty package products 
consisting of combined property and casualty lines, for a 
range of public and non-profit entities and adjudicated care 
providers. While competition in both the US excess and 
surplus (E&S) and admitted markets for these classes has 
increased, the expertise required to underwrite this business 
coupled with the budgetary certainty required by many of 
our policyholders, moderates new market entrants and rate 
volatility. Our pricing and retention ratios remain strong.
BGSU also writes a mix of property business in the E&S and 
facultative reinsurance market. Compounded by another 
benign Atlantic hurricane season, greater competition 
has put continued pressure on US property rates, terms 
and conditions. The restructuring of the Maiden specialty 
business acquired in our 2013 renewal rights transaction has 
left our US E&S business well placed to respond to these 
headwinds. We have developed a more focused distribution 
strategy, recalibrated underwriting appetite and imposed 
consistent pricing discipline across this business. 32     Brit PLC  Annual Report 2014
In 2014 this was illustrated by 17.0% growth in our GWP 
(22.4% at constant FX rates). The benefits of organic growth  
in more resilient lines such as property binders, US specialty 
and the income from new initiatives such as aviation,  
more than offset our underwriting discipline of reducing  
our energy account. 
Brit Global Specialty Direct’s CoR was 96.0%, driven by a 
particularly pleasing attritional loss ratio of 51.3%.

STRATEGIC REPORT
Market position
Our core lines:
• Property – We underwrite, on both an open market 
and a binding authority basis, a portfolio of commercial, 
residential and high net worth homeowner risks. We have  
a long-standing leadership position in the binding authority 
market and, in recent years, have focused successfully on 
increasing our profile and leadership capabilities in the 
open market. 
• Energy – Our energy account is focused on upstream and 
midstream business, following our withdrawal from the 
poorly performing downstream market in 2012. We both 
lead and follow on risks we write, and work with national oil 
companies and major integrated energy companies. We 
also insure independent operators in the oil and gas sector.
• Casualty – We have an established strong lead capability 
in our core competencies of professional indemnity (PI), 
financial institutions (FI), directors and officers (D&O) and 
legal expenses. Our PI account is well positioned within 
Lloyd’s, reflecting strength in both US and international 
business. We have a clearly defined risk appetite and have 
no material exposure to the systemic risk areas of IFAs, UK 
solicitors and UK surveyors. We have demonstrated strong 
portfolio management by actively managing our exposures 
in response to the decline in the global economy, while 
retaining our expertise for when the outlook improves. 
Our diversifying lines:
• Marine – Our marine account was one of the key areas of 
focus during our re-underwriting from 2008 to 2012 and the 
profitability of this account has been transformed over the 
last three years. Our marine book is now a balanced account 
of cargo (including fine art and specie), hull (including yachts 
and war) and marine liability, with a particular focus on 
higher-margin niche areas such as yacht, war and cargo. It is 
now positioned for growth when market conditions allow.
• Terrorism, political and aerospace – Our underwriting 
expertise combined with the use of market leading risk 
assessment tools has resulted in terrorism being a highly 
profitable class. We launched our new cyber-attack product 
in 2014, after working with cyber security experts and 
clients to develop an innovative solution tailored to their 
needs. Political and credit insurance is a niche market within 
Lloyd’s where service and expertise are key to attracting 
the best business. In the second half of 2013, we recruited 
specialist political and credit underwriters and anticipate 
that premium from these risks will increase during 2015,  
as the team builds on a successful first full year.
We set up our aviation division in June 2014, following 
our acquisition of the renewal rights to QBE’s London-
based dedicated Lloyd’s aviation business, together with 
its associated underwriting and claims teams. The team 
underwrites a diverse book of general aviation, airlines and 
products liability and is one of the lead participants in  
the Lloyd’s aviation market. The aviation book also includes 
space where we lead the Brit Space Consortium.
• Accident and health – Our accident and health account 
is a diverse portfolio of personal accident, contingency 
and bloodstock business. These classes are niche profitable 
business lines where we have a strong market profile and 
leadership position within Lloyd’ s. Our business is generated 
from a broad range of sources, on both open market and 
binding authority bases.  34     Brit PLC  Annual Report 2014
UNDERWRITING REVIEW – DIVISIONAL PERFORMANCE
• Specialist liability – Our specialist liability book contains  
UK employer’ s liability, UK public liability and an international 
non-US general liability book. In 2014 we started underwriting 
environmental impairment liability risks on a claims made 
basis. Historically, our specialist liability account has been 
weighted towards higher hazard business in which the Lloyd’ s  
market specialises. However , following changes to our underwriting 
personnel, we are rebalancing this account to complement  
the relatively volatile higher hazard business with the  
more predictable standard business which is experiencing 
rising rates.
Market commentary 
Trends in pricing, competition and terms of business differ 
significantly between the broad range of classes within our 
direct book. Excess supply of capital is a common theme in 
most areas. We continue to see more pressure in open market 
business, particularly in property and energy business, while 
the greatest resilience is seen in more specialty lines such as 
casualty, US specialty and marine. 
Our core lines:
• Property – While the market has seen some loss activity 
such as Hurricane Odile and the Nebraska Floods, the 
relative low level of major losses will result in continued 
downwards pressure on open market rates in 2015. Our 
binding authority book is experiencing a more stable 
rating environment and we targeted a number of profitable 
growth opportunities in 2014. We will continue to seek 
such opportunities in 2015. Having established a UK 
property team in 2014, we view this as an area for future 
development that is both complementary and diversifying 
to our existing book. The combination of binder growth 
and our new UK property team led to a 23.7% growth in 
property premium in 2014.
• Energy – Recent positive claims experience, together 
with the benign Gulf of Mexico hurricane season, have 
contributed to a good performance in 2014. However, this 
in turn has led to rating pressure and during 2014 we have 
reduced volumes by 22.4% to £82.4m. We would expect  
to demonstrate further discipline in 2015 as rates continue 
to experience pressure. 
• Casualty – D&O, FI and PI are the casualty classes most 
exposed to economic volatility and, due to their long-
tail nature, are also adversely affected by the current 
low interest rate environment. In general, the insurance 
market has not experienced material losses from recent 
headline events such as PPI, LIBOR and forex. However, 
the emergence of these events validates our decision 
to maintain our defensive stance to economic related 
exposures. In 2014 our premium levels increased marginally 
to £239.0m and we are continuing to see resilience in 
pricing into 2015.
Our diversifying lines: 
• Marine – While there were no major market losses in 2014, 
the deterioration in the 2012 Costa Concordia loss has 
sustained increased rating levels in marine liability. Our 
marine liability book has also grown as the increased market 
pricing levels have improved rate adequacy. Following the 
addition of new underwriters in open market cargo, we have 
experienced growth in 2014; this has been in conjunction 
with the recruitment of a team to write fine art and specie, 
changing this profitable niche area from an incidental part 
of our portfolio to an area of specialism. Overall the marine 
book grew by 9.7% in 2014. 
• Terrorism, political and aerospace – The market has been 
affected by the political situation in Russia and Ukraine  
and the extent of current market losses remains uncertain.  Brit PLC  Annual Report 2014     35     
STRATEGIC REPORT
As we only commenced underwriting in 2014, our exposure 
to these events is very limited.
The aviation market experienced a number of high profile 
losses in 2014, particularly the two Malaysian Airliners, 
Air Asia and the Tripoli airport attacks. The market has 
responded to these events, albeit in a rather muted way with 
marginally increased rates in aviation war and airlines. Our 
team has made a successful start since they joined in June 
2014, and in response to the changing market dynamics 
exceeded our plan for the second half of the year by writing 
£29.7m of GWP .
• Accident and health – All product lines have seen high 
levels of competition over recent years as a number of new 
market entrants, particularly within Lloyd’s, have increased 
the available capacity. These lines are attractive to start-ups 
as they have relatively modest capital requirements and 
are largely free from natural catastrophe exposure. Some 
market areas have seen a number of risk losses, such as 
contingency relating to cancellation and non-appearance, 
which have served to moderate premium rate reductions. 
• Specialist liability – The UK employer’s liability and UK 
public liability markets have seen an increase in loss activity 
following a prolonged period of profitability and benign 
loss experience. We were exposed to some of these one-
off losses in 2014. As a result, the market is experiencing 
positive rate changes and a number of insurers are 
redefining their risk appetite.  36     Brit PLC  Annual Report 2014
OPPORTUNITY-DRIVEN GROWTH
Acquisition of market-leading  
aviation team
In July 2014, we acquired the renewal rights to QBE’s London-based dedicated Lloyd’s aviation 
business, and acquired the associated underwriting and claims teams. This represented a 
unique opportunity for us to assume a market leading team of highly experienced underwriters 
in a business line where Lloyd’s has significant scale and global relevance. Our aviation 
team writes across all major lines of the aviation market and management expect that the 
assimilation into our efficient cost and capital platform will lead to this team contributing to 
Group profitability immediately. This type of transaction highlights our commitment to move 
decisively when opportunities arise. Brit PLC  Annual Report 2014     37

Market position
Our short-tail reinsurance business focuses on property 
treaty, both in the US and internationally. Our target business 
emanates from territories with established catastrophe 
models, including the US, Canada, Europe, Japan, Australia 
and New Zealand. Our account also contains an element of 
excess of loss treaties, which normally exclude catastrophe 
perils. This offers some spread of risk within this catastrophe 
driven book and allows us to offer a complete product suite 
to our policyholders. This book has been significantly re-
underwritten since 2011 under the guidance of a new portfolio 
director. The volume of premium written has reduced by 
32.6% over the last five years due to our focus on pricing 
adequacy and profitability, while the attritional loss ratio and 
CoR have improved significantly.
Our long-tail reinsurance business has been one of our most 
consistently successful business lines over the past 14 years. 
The portfolio contains a diverse book of casualty and specialist 
treaties, a rare business mix within the Lloyd’s market. It also 
contains a broad range of products, including whole account 
casualty clash reinsurance covers, professional indemnity 
risk placements, together with niche areas in which we have 
expertise such as terrorism, contingency, personal accident, 
political risks and kidnap and ransom. The portfolio has an 
excellent long-term track record of profitability and we are a 
recognised market leader with strong long-term relationships 
with cedants. This has been illustrated in 2014 as, even 
though policyholders have been buying less cover, we have 
maintained our position through leadership and increased 
distribution capability.
Market commentary 
While the property treaty market has experienced some 
smaller events during 2014 such as the Nordic spring storms, 
Hurricane Odile and Nebraska floods, its overall catastrophe 
experience has been relatively benign. With pricing down 
around 15% to 20% from the 2012 highs and alternative 
capital sources continuing to enter the market, we continue to 
expect further pressure on pricing and terms in 2015. For the 
1 January 2015 US property treaty renewals, rates decreased 
by 10.9%; this represented a slowing of recent rate decreases 
which suggests that rating levels are beginning to stabilise as 
technical pricing levels are reached. 
We expect to maintain pricing discipline and as a result would 
expect premium volume to reduce further. Despite the level 
of capacity within the market, our property treaty underwriters 
continued to maintain a good profile and remain focused 
on maintaining service levels and building relationships 
with cedants who want continuity from long-term capacity 
providers, such as ourselves. 
For 2015 we have taken advantage of current conditions 
to broaden our outwards property treaty retrocessional 
protections by placing a US$75m fully collateralised quota 
share with Versutus Limited, a Bermuda based reinsurance 
vehicle. This allows us to build relationships with newer 
providers of alternative capacity within the market. 
The long-tail reinsurance market has seen increased 
competition as competitors seek diversity and, as cedants,  
re-evaluate their coverage requirements. Pricing however is 
still attractive and our portfolio has an excellent long-term 
track record of profitability and we are a recognised market 
leader with strong long-term cedent relationships. We feel 
we are well positioned to protect our current market-leading 
position, while maintaining strong profitability in order to 
respond to a market turn.

INVESTMENT 
MANAGEMENT REVIEW
WE HAVE A DIVERSIFIED AND DYNAMIC APPROACH TO 
INVESTMENT STRATEGY. INVESTMENT RETURN IS A KEY 
COMPONENT OF BRIT’S EARNINGS AND A STRATEGIC  
PRIORITY FOR US. 
The recent low interest rate environment and weak global 
economic performance has presented a challenging 
environment for insurers for a number of years. We have 
realigned our investment strategy and have transitioned 
to a broader mix of asset classes in order to deliver a 
more balanced and consistent risk adjusted return for 
our shareholders. We have also invested in our in-house 
capabilities that allow us to be more proactive in tactical 
decision-making within asset classes, which we feel is 
necessary in what remain challenging investment markets.
Performance and approach
2014 has produced a strong investment performance, driven 
by two aspects of our strategy – the focus on generating a 
higher running yield and our broader exposure to credit  
markets. Our 2014 investment return of 2.9% was a combination  
of 2.2% of investment income and 0.9% of mark-to-market 
gains on the portfolio, less fees equivalent to 0.2%.
Our investment strategy has taken a more balanced approach 
to generating income, with a longer duration of around two 
years maintained for most of 2014 and a broader exposure to 
credit resulting in a higher running yield. 
We continue to review our asset mix and have tactically moved to 
a slightly more defensive credit positioning in late 2014. In addition 
we have rebalanced some assets into our growth/diversifying 
portfolio. Both of these changes are intended to reduce the impact 
of any ‘surprise’ negative data, while broadly maintaining the 
potential returns in a strong economic environment. 
As 2014 developed, we reviewed the positioning of the 
portfolio and responded to reflect our view of the relative risk 
adjusted value in the market. The key change was to tactically 
shorten the duration of the asset portfolio. Our view is that 
there is a higher chance of an increase in yields anticipating 
rate rises during the first half of 2015, following strong 
economic data in the US. This positioning protects the income 
statement against shock increases in the yield curve in return for 
a modest reduction in our running yield. 
During 2015, we will continue to keep our asset mix and 
positioning of our portfolio under review.
Overall, our annual running yield remains strong at 2.2% based 
on the portfolio at 31 December 2014. We continue to actively 
monitor our duration position and seek to manage this to 
optimise our investment return. In the longer-term our strategy 
remains to match the duration of our assets to liabilities and 
we would expect this to begin to be implemented early in 
2015 as yields begin to rise.
We retain a strong liquidity position and a healthy cash and 
cash equivalents allocation, which on occasions during the year 
has been above our appetite as a consequence of managers 
holding cash due to their views of the markets. We are 
comfortable that our liquidity needs are more than adequately 
met by the assets held and even in a severe insurance and 
investment stressed scenario, we have surplus liquidity.
The investment return is an important focus for Brit, given 
the asset leverage our business mix affords us. After allowing 
for the recommended final and special 2014 dividends, our 
invested assets were approximately 3.7 times our adjusted 
NTA, so every 1% of investment return contributes almost  
3.7 percentage points to our RoNTA. This highlights why we 
have invested considerable time and resource in building 
a strong investment management platform, defining clear 
investment guidelines and selecting the highest quality third 
party managers for our funds.
Our proactive approach to asset allocation and management 
has resulted in resilience to the volatile market conditions.  
This proactive approach positions us well both to react quickly 
to fluctuations in the financial markets and changes in macro- 
economic conditions and to achieve relative risk-adjusted returns.

Our investments in specialised investment funds account for 
41.7% of our invested assets and the investments within these 
funds are analysed in the tables on page 41. We use these 
fund structures as vehicles for investment as we believe they 
deliver a number of advantages:
• Group structure: Where a number of Group entities hold 
similar investments, it is significantly more efficient for these 
entities to invest via a fund structure, rather than having 
separate segregated mandates; 
• Investment strategy: Where a Group entity wishes to make 
a small investment in a niche strategy or specialist manager 
a separate managed account would often not be viable.  
A fund structure facilitates such an investment;
• Operational complexity: Some of the investment strategies 
are complex. By investing through a fund that complexity 
is centralised within the fund and is the responsibility of the 
fund manager; and
• Admissibility: A fund structure simplifies the regulatory 
admissibility assessment, especially when the structure 
meets the requirement for ‘undertakings for collective 
investment in transferable securities’ (UCITS). 
At 31 December 2014, cash and cash equivalents accounted

INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT REVIEW EXTENDING DISTRIBUTION CAPABILITY
Latin America
A strategic expansion into Latin America was initiated through 
the hiring of an experienced underwriting team in Miami in 
June 2014. The office will focus on expanding Brit Global 
Specialty USA’s successful US facultative property platform into 
the Latin American and Caribbean markets, in line with our 
strategy of growing efficiently and profitably into international 
markets. Latin America is a natural evolution of our 
international strategy and Miami is an increasingly important 
hub in the placement of Latin American business.

Financial position
At 31 December 2014 our adjusted net tangible assets 
totalled £775.4m or 194.0pps (2013: £661.2m/168.6pps),  
an increase of 17.3% in the year. 
In addition to the profit recognised through the consolidated 
income statement, the other movements in our net assets 
related to:
• Defined benefit pension scheme related gains (£0.3m);
• Share transactions related gains (£1.8m);
• Share-based payment charges (£0.6m); and
• The interim dividend (£25.0m) paid in September 2014.
Our increase in GWP of 9.8%, which is explained further on 
page 50, has resulted in increases in both our ‘reinsurance 
contracts’ balance and our ‘insurance and other receivables’ 
balance. The growth in our ‘reinsurance contracts’ balance was 
also influenced by a one-off reinsurance contract explained on 
page 53.
Further analysis of our financial investments, cash and 
investment related derivatives are set out in the Investment 
Management Review on page 40.
Approximately half of our net assets are held in US dollars,

Capital strength
At Brit we carry capital resources significantly in excess of our 
management capital requirements and seek to hold capital 
resources in a range of 120% to 140% of our requirement. We 
believe this is an appropriate level of capital for the business 
and provides management with:
• The flexibility to absorb major losses while still being 
in a position to take advantage of subsequent market 
dislocations;
• The ability to pursue opportunity-driven growth in our core 
business; and 
• The support to provide continuity in regular dividend 
payments to shareholders.
As shown in the table below, our statement of financial 
position remains strong, with capital resources equivalent to 
150.4% of requirements (2013: 141.0%). Following approval 
and payment of the recommended final ordinary and special 
dividends, the 31 December 2014 capital ratio will reduce  
to 136.0%.
Total value created for shareholders in 2014 was £139.2m. 
We have recommended a final ordinary dividend of £50.1m 
(12.5pps) for 2014. As stated at the time of the IPO, in the 
event that our capital position is in excess of requirements and 
we do not need this for growth opportunities, we will return 
it to our shareholders. After allowing for an increase in our 
capital requirements for 2015, driven by the growth of our 
business and overall pressure on market conditions, the capital 
buffer remained above our target level of 140%. Therefore, 
we have also recommended a special dividend of £50.1m 
(12.5pps) taking total dividends paid or recommended since 
the IPO in April 2014 to £125.2m (31.25pps). 
We remain committed to proactive capital and risk management. 
After allowing for these dividends, our excess of capital 
resources over management entity capital requirements of 
£251.7m, a capital ratio of 136.0%, remains at the high end of 
our target range of 120% to 140% and is still comfortably in 
excess of our maximum RDS event on a net basis of £113m. 
Operational advantage
We have repositioned our business around the Lloyd’s 
platform because we believe that, as currently structured and 
operating, it represents the most efficient platform available 
from which to underwrite specialty business globally. It also 
means that we do not dissipate our capital by supporting 
separately regulated insurance entities in other jurisdictions. 
Through our Syndicate 2987, backed 100% by our own capital 
and benefiting from the Lloyd’s rating, we can write most 
classes of business in over 200 countries, making use of the 
comprehensive set of licences that Lloyd’s has secured.
The key metrics we use to demonstrate our operational 
advantage are our premium leverage of 1.9 times adjusted 
NTA which is a direct benefit of the Lloyd’s only platform 
and asset leverage of 3.7 times adjusted NTA (post year end 
recommended dividends) due to our specialty insurance focus. 
This drives the efficiency of our business model, whereby  46     Brit PLC  Annual Report 2014
1% of underwriting profit translates to 1.5 percentage points 
RoNTA and 1% return on invested assets translates to 3.7 
percentage points of pre-tax RoNTA.
This highlights how Brit can continue to generate attractive 
mid to high teens RoNTA (even higher in years such as 2013 
and 2014 with low natural catastrophe activity) while still 
maintaining very strong capital resources as demonstrated by 
the capital buffer. 
Gearing
At 31 December 2014 our gearing ratio was 13.8% (2013: 
21.9%). The reduction in the ratio reflects the collateralisation 
of the US$80.0m letter of credit in April 2014.
We have successfully renegotiated our revolving credit facility. 
The facility limit remains at £225.0m and has been extended 
by one year to 31 December 2018. Under our capital policy 
we have identified a maximum of US$235.0m (2013: £125.0m) 
of the facility to form part of our capital resources, with the 
balance available for liquidity funding. At 31 December 2014  
a fully collateralised US$80.0m letter of credit was in place  
(31 December 2013: US$80.0m/uncollateralised) to support 
our underwriting activities. At 31 December 2014 and at  
31 December 2013 no other drawings were outstanding on 
the facility. 
In addition, we have in issue £135.0m of 6.625% Lower Tier 
Two subordinated debt with a carrying value of £124.5m  
(31 December 2013: £123.2m). This instrument, which is listed 
on the London Stock Exchange, was issued in December 
2005, is callable in whole by Brit on 9 December 2020 and 
matures in 2030. 
Reserving policy
Preserving a strong statement of financial position is critical 
to the long-term success of an insurance business. The Group 
maintains appropriate loss reserves to cover its estimated 
future liabilities. Reserves are estimates that involve actuarial 
and statistical projections of the expected cost of the ultimate 
settlement and administration of claims. The reserving process 
is robust and managed by the Chief Actuary and under the 
oversight of the Reserving Committee. Reserving estimates are 
prepared quarterly and are based on facts and circumstances 
then known, predictions of future developments, estimates 
of future trends in claims frequency and severity and other 
variable factors such as inflation. Movement in these reserves 
forms an integral element of our operating result. 
Our reserving policy is to reserve to a ‘conservative best estimate’ 
and carry an explicit risk margin above that ‘conservative 
best estimate’. This policy has led to a track record of modest 
annual reserve releases. In 2014 this trend continued with net 
releases of £32.1m (2013: £57.3m). Maintaining reserves is 
critical to safeguard future obligations to policyholders and 
the ‘conservative best estimate’ approach provides a secure 
foundation. It also provides a secure foundation for the pricing 
of new business which is particularly critical in a softening 
rating environment.
Foreign exchange management
The reporting currency for the Group’s consolidated  
financial statements is Sterling, which is also the functional 
currency for all of our material subsidiaries. Substantial 
portions of our revenues and expenses, and assets and 
liabilities are denominated in currencies other than Sterling. 
We are therefore exposed to fluctuations in the values of those 
currencies against Sterling and these fluctuations impact our 
reported operating results and our assets and liabilities.
We have sought to immunise our stakeholders from the effects 
of movements in foreign exchange rates by matching the 
currencies of our liabilities and capital requirements with the 
assets we hold. As a consequence of this, because we report 
our results in Sterling, we import some exchange rate volatility 
into the income statement through the revaluation of our net

tangible assets. This income statement movement is, however, 
matching the movement in our capital requirement, so we are 
‘solvency matched’, thereby protecting the position of our 
shareholders. 
In the first half of 2014, Sterling strengthened against most  
of the other key currencies to which we had exposure.  
At 30 June 2014, the revaluation of our net tangible assets 
resulted in the foreign exchange losses we reported at that 
date. This strengthening was followed by a weakening in 
Sterling and a material strengthening of the US dollar against 
most other currencies. While these currency movements 
import volatility into the reported result, the movements are 
broadly matching the currency driven movement in the capital 
requirement thereby protecting our solvency position.
The regulatory environment
The conduct of insurance and reinsurance business is 
subject to significant and increasing legal and regulatory 
requirements. Any future legislative or regulatory changes in 
the EU (in particular, the UK and Gibraltar), the US, Bermuda 
and elsewhere may potentially affect our businesses. 
Over the last six years, like our peers in the London market, 
we have been preparing for the planned introduction from 
1 January 2016 of a risk-based prudential regime in the 
European Union known as ‘Solvency II’. We have made 
significant investment to ensure we are prepared for Solvency 
II and our Syndicate is rated ‘green’ by Lloyd’s for its Solvency 
II readiness.
Operating efficiency and cost control
Since 2011, we have focused on expense efficiency and 
we have significantly reduced our expense base as part of 
our transformation programme. We have disposed of our 
insurance company and have partnered with outsourcing 
specialist Infosys who provides much of our IT and operational 
support.
From a headcount of around 750 in 2010, we had by 2012 
reduced the number of employees to 339, creating a lean and 
efficient back office where the focus is on scalability. At  
31 December 2014 our headcount, excluding all non-
executive directors, was 466, reflecting the Group’s initiatives 
over the last two years such as targeted growth in our US 
operations and the acquisition of QBE’s aviation book.
We have also made, and continue to make, selective 
investments in our operating platform. These investment 
actions have included the upgrade to our core IT infrastructure, 
underwriting systems and back office capability in the areas  
of risk, investments, claims handling, finance and performance 
reporting. This investment has enhanced our operational 
and management capability, enabling improved support of, 
and control over, our key revenue generating platforms of 
underwriting and investment management.
We look at three key metrics in this area.
• The ratio of front office staff to back office staff. In 2014, 
this ratio has improved from 149.7% to 159.8%;  
• The premiums per head in all our operations. In London we 
think that it should be possible to achieve around £2.5m 
per person. In the US we believe that it is possible to target 
£1.5m per member of staff; and 
• The operating expense ratio, seeking to achieve what we 
believe is a class leading 11% to 12% ratio. In 2014, we 
have maintained our operating ratio at 12.0% (2013: 12.0%).

Group performance and total value added
We have delivered a strong performance in our first period as a re-listed Group. Underwriting return was healthy, benefiting from 
targeted premium growth, a low attritional loss ratio, an absence of large losses and favourable reserve development. This was 
supported by a very competitive investment return net of fees of 2.9%. Our result for the year also included costs incurred in 
relation to the IPO.
Profit before tax for the year was £149.1m (2013: £107.4m) and profit after tax was £139.0m (2013: £99.5m). Return on adjusted 
net tangible assets excluding the effects of FX on monetary items and IPO costs (RoNTA), decreased to 20.7% (2013: 24.2%).  
Basic EPS was 34.8 pence per share (pps) (2013: 24.1pps). Total value created for the year was £139.2m (2013: £91.3m). 
Our adjusted net tangible assets increased to £775.4m or 194.0pps (2013: £661.2m/168.6pps), after payment in September  
of an interim dividend of £25.0m.   Brit PLC Annual Report 2014 49
STRATEGIC REPORT
Dividends
The Board declared and paid an interim dividend of 6.25pps. The Board has also recommended a final ordinary dividend of

STRATEGIC REPORT
These drivers are explained further below:
• The Group’s underwriting initiatives, launched in both  
2013 and 2014 resulted in a £93.4m increase in GWP .  
The main contributors were aviation, Bermuda, high value 
homeowners, BGSU and political and credit.
• The Group’s organic growth of £32.3m was driven by 
growth in classes experiencing favourable rate increases 
including the property binder book, specialist liability and 
marine. These growth areas were partly offset by premium 
reductions in classes experiencing falling rates including 
reinsurance and energy.
• The favourable development on prior years of £44.6m 
has resulted from a review of premium estimates, 
predominantly from our casualty book. This business was 
originally written in a stronger rating environment.
• These growth areas were offset by the impact of foreign 
exchange (£53.9m), which reflects the movements during 
2014 of Sterling against a number of currencies in which  
the Group writes business including the US dollar.
An increasing proportion of our GWP is US dollar-denominated, 
reflecting the expansion of our US operations. Our GWP 
analysed by currency is set out below.

influenced by reinsurance business which experienced rate reductions of 7.4%, driven by a 10.6% rate reduction in property

Our retention rate for the period was 83.0% (2013: 83.0%). The retention rates we achieved in 2013 and 2014 reflect the 
successful renewal of a profitable book of business, following the re-underwriting of the book that occurred between 2008 and 
2012, through which we rebalanced our book and non-renewed around half of our underwriting portfolio.    Brit PLC Annual Report 2014 53
STRATEGIC REPORT
Outwards reinsurance
Our reinsurance expenditure in 2014 was £277.2m or 21.3% of GWP (2013: £229.4m/19.3%), an increase of £47.8m (20.8%).  
At constant exchange rates the overall increase was 26.3% (2013: 7.0%).
Included within our 2014 reinsurance expenditure was £42.9m in respect of a specific one-off reinsurance contract, entered  
into to provide adverse development cover for a discontinued professional lines account with exposure to Italian medical 
malpractice. This contract has provided the Group with significantly greater certainty over a poorly performing legacy account. 
Under the terms of this contract, £40.3m of reserves transferred to the reinsurer, resulting in a net cost to the Group of £2.6m. 
An effect of this contract was to reduce our attritional ratio by 1.9 percentage points and increase our underwriting expense ratio 
by 1.7 percentage points. It did not materially impact our combined ratio. 
During 2014, we also took advantage of reinsurance market conditions to strengthen significantly our catastrophe cover. These 
additional protections include a Group-wide property aggregate catastrophe cover and some additional variable quota share 
protections. As a result, the expected recoveries against a number of our realistic disaster scenarios (RDS) have increased, 
thereby reducing our net exposure to such events. Our largest net exposure under the Lloyd’s-defined RDSs has fallen to £113m 
(2013: £149m).
Net earned premium
Net earned premium in 2014, excluding the effects of foreign exchange on non-monetary items, increased by 2.4% to £970.4m 
(2013: £947.7m/0.5%). This growth was impacted by the £42.9m reinsurance premium paid in respect of the specific one-off 
reinsurance contract referred to in the outwards reinsurance section. 
Direct business increased by 7.2% to £756.4m (2013: £705.7m/2.3%), while reinsurance decreased by 15.5% to £201.2m (2013: 
£238.1m/3.6%).
At constant exchange rates the overall increase was 7.4% (2013: decrease of 1.2%).

reserves
This measure shows the percentage of opening 
reserves that are released to the income 
statement during the year.
Our claims experience in 2014 was in line with expectations. 
Our 51.0% attritional ratio has benefited by 1.9 percentage points from the one-off reinsurance contract as described above. 
This has offset deterioration arising from rating pressures and a change in business mix resulting from a reduction in short-tail 
reinsurance and an increase in lines such as specialist liability, the property binders book and marine.
2014 saw limited natural catastrophe activity, the only event being Hurricane Odile which resulted in incurred net losses of £8.8m. 
We had immaterial exposure to the losses of Malaysian Airlines’ MH370 and MH17, the Korean ferry (SEWOL) and Air Asia, but 
we did incur net losses of £12.9m from the Tripoli airport attack.
As part of our quarterly reserving process, we released £32.1m of claims reserves established for prior year claims, the equivalent 
of a combined ratio reduction of 3.3% (2013: £57.3m/6.0%). Of this reserve release, 87.9% was derived from the 2011 and prior 
underwriting years (2013: 88.5% from the 2010 and prior underwriting years).The main drivers of this release were casualty treaty, 
property treaty and marine. Our statement of financial position remains strong and we continue to operate a robust reserving process.

Commission costs were £269.9m and the commission expense ratio was 27.5% (2013: £235.8m/24.9%). In addition to the effects 
of the one-off reinsurance, the ratio was affected by changes in business mix, including increased binder business. We wrote 
more business through cover-holders as, in the current softening conditions, the rating of this business tends to be better than 
open market business.

FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE REVIEW
Our income producing assets performed well and we generated income of £57.9m during the year, representing a running yield 
of 2.2% (2013: £57.5m/2.2%). Our total return in 2014 of £75.7m (2013: £54.7m) was influenced by falling bond yields and a 
contraction in credit spreads across the US and European markets which led to gains on our fixed income and credit portfolios. 
Our growth assets showed gains as equity markets and alternatives rose.
Within our unrealised gains for the year there are £15.1m of gains made within fund investments (2013: £8.3m). Of these gains, 
£9.1m was distributed on scheduled distribution dates in January 2015 (January 2014: £nil), thereby converting unrealised gains 
into income.
Further discussion of our investment performance and portfolio is included in the Investment Management Review section of 
this Strategic Report, commencing on page 40.
Expenses
Our operating expense ratio was unchanged at 12.0% (2013: 12.0%) and includes 0.6 percentage points resulting from the  
one-off reinsurance contract mentioned above. Operating expenses for the period were as follows:

Underlying operating expenses during 2014 increased by 6.6% to £138.0m (2013: £129.5m). This increase related to an increase 
in bonus costs, targeted expansion and investment in growth areas such as our US specialty business (BGSU) and aviation, 
together with increased costs reflecting the Company’s listed status.

STRATEGIC REPORT
Foreign exchange
As explained on page 46, we manage our currency exposures to mitigate its impact on solvency rather than to achieve  
a short-term impact on earnings. We experienced a total foreign exchange gain of £21.6m in 2014 (2013: loss of £58.2m).  
This total foreign exchange related gain comprised:
• An unrealised revaluation loss of £0.4m (2013: loss of £65.4m), primarily relating to the mark to market of the capital we hold 
in non-Sterling currencies to match our risk exposures. The loss comprises a gain of £20.6m resulting from the weakening 
of Sterling against the US dollar, offset by losses of £21.0m resulting from the strengthening of Sterling against a number of 
other currencies, primarily the Euro, Australian dollar and the Canadian dollar;
• Gains of £1.7m (2013: gain of £13.2m) on derivative contracts which were entered into to help manage our FX exposures; and
• An accounting gain of £20.3m (2013: loss of £6.0m), as a result of the IFRS requirement to recognise non-monetary assets 
and liabilities at historic exchange rates.
The allocation of the FX result within the consolidated income statement is as follows:
         2014 2013
Foreign exchange gains and (losses)        £m £m
Net change in unearned premium provision – non-monetary FX effect     9.3 (2.2)

Tax
The Group is liable to taxes on its corporate income in a number of jurisdictions, in particular the UK, Gibraltar and the US, 
where its companies carry on business. Our effective tax rate for the period was 6.8% (2013: 6.1%), which is a composite tax rate 
reflecting the mix of the tax rates charged in those jurisdictions.

MANAGEMENT
60 Brit PLC Annual Report 2014
2014 in focus
In 2014 the risk management team at Brit continued to 
operate an embedded risk management framework which 
was coordinated around all key initiatives undertaken during 
the year. Some of the key reviews performed included:
• New business initiatives such as the acquisition of the 
renewal rights of QBE’s Lloyd’s aviation portfolio;
• Commutation of a reinsurance contract relating to the 
restructuring of the Group in 2012 (see page 21);
• Optimisation of the outwards reinsurance programme; and
• Assessment of the hedging options to mitigate foreign 
exchange and interest rate risks.
These reviews included qualitative risk assessments, risk 
appetite and capital implications using our internal model 
which continued to be developed in 2014 to ensure that it 
meets both regulatory and business use requirements. 
The quarterly ‘own risk and solvency assessment’ (ORSA) 
process continues to be used to communicate the risks across 
our Group and is seen as a valuable tool by management in 
understanding the risks that the Group faces. 
The risk management team has also been instrumental in 
the continued delivery of our Solvency II implementation. In 
particular, significant improvements were made around the 
internal model approval such as further enhancements in the 
modelling and validation to support the use of the model 
in our business. There has been an increased regulatory 
focus on Solvency II in 2014 and we have continued to make 
significant progress with the Syndicate, which is now close 
to full compliance, and in Gibraltar, where implementation 
is well under way. The risk management team played an 
instrumental role in continuing to build strong relationships 
with regulators and engaging in on-going communication as 
part of the regulatory review.
Risk Governance
The Board is responsible for overseeing our risk management 
and internal control systems, which management is 
responsible for implementing. 
We maintain a strong risk governance framework using Risk 
Oversight Committees and Audit Committees consisting of 
independent Non-Executive Directors. The Risk Oversight 
Committees monitor and review the risk profile and the 
effectiveness of all risk management activities and, in 
particular, monitor adherence to agreed risk limits. Our 
internal audit function provides assurance to the Risk 
Oversight Committees, Audit Committees and Boards, 
while external audits are regularly used for independent 
assessments. 
This governance structure is applicable at the Group and 
entity level and represents the three lines of defence 
operating at Brit. Within the first line of defence individual 
risk committees monitor day-to-day risk control activities.

STRATEGIC REPORT
The risk management function, as a second line of defence, 
provides oversight over business processes and sets out 
policies and procedures. The Audit Committee, as a third line 
of defence, provides independent assurance and monitors 
the effectiveness of the risk management processes.
Enterprise risk management framework
At Brit we deliver shareholder value by actively seeking and 
accepting risk within agreed limits. Our risk management 
policy highlights the importance of managing the impact of 
risk on the economic value of our Group. This is achieved by 
appropriately managing and controlling all risk exposures 
through the enterprise risk management framework (ERMF). 
This framework sets out a transparent process to identify, 
assess and manage risk and deploy risk appetite utilising 
an economic capital approach. This process enables us to 
protect policyholders and maximise shareholder value by 
ensuring the risk and capital implications of business strategy 
are well understood. 
Under this framework the risk management team with the 
guidance of the Chief Risk Officer (CRO) ensures that our 
Group operates within the risk tolerance level approved by 
the Board. This includes the assessment of the new strategic 
initiatives and principal risks and uncertainties faced by the 
business as detailed below.
Our ERMF was designed to enable the Boards to set an 
appropriate risk strategy for the business and ensure that risk 
is managed throughout the organisation. The development 
of our ERMF ensures a strong culture of risk control and risk 
management continues to be embedded across our Group. 
Risk appetite is set by the Board and cascaded throughout 
the organisation. We monitor the aggregation of risk across 
the business and have overarching limits in place to manage 
this. In addition to the overarching limits, the ERMF clearly 
identifies the key risk categories and risk tolerances set for 
each risk category.
Principal risks and uncertainties
The Board monitors the key risks that the company is 
exposed to against its tolerance level through the quarterly 
ORSA. This includes both the qualitative assessment of the 
risk control environment and capital assessment using  
a stochastic model. 
The key categories of risk include:
• Overarching risk: earnings, solvency and liquidity; and
• Individual risk categories: insurance, market, credit and 
operational, and group.
Insurance risk is the key driver of our Group capital 
requirements.

AND ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS
66 Brit PLC Annual Report 2014
Introduction
In order to generate value for our investors, we recognise 
that our people, culture, social, community, human rights 
and environmental strategies must be both sustainable and 
aligned to the long-term interests of all our stakeholders. We 
seek to make both a positive contribution to society and to be 
aware of the long-term consequences of our actions. 
The responsibility to build a sustainable business means 
recognising and respecting the connections between 
customers, investors, business partners, the marketplace, the 
workplace, the environment and society at large. Sustainability 
means we seek to generate new commercial opportunities by 
developing strong stakeholder relationships and by recruiting 
and retaining a highly skilled, engaged and motivated 
workforce. 
Our people and culture
Our people are our greatest asset and managing our talent 
appropriately contributes significantly to our success. 
During 2014 we continued to strengthen our highly committed 
team. Through the attraction and recruitment of new talent and 
the ongoing development of existing expertise, we continued 
to embed a culture of achievement in the organisation. This has 
resulted in employees feeling valued for their contribution as 
part of a team working towards the same goals. 
As part of this, over the past two years we have performed 
engagement surveys to help us understand how our 
employees view our company, the corporate environment and 
the behaviour of management. We had an extremely high 
participation in both of those surveys with 2014 participation 
at 89%, up 4% on last year. 
The survey is a powerful tool which provides a significant 
amount of invaluable feedback on what we are doing well 
and where we have room for improvement. We take the 
feedback very seriously and make every effort to continuously 
improve our work environment and culture. This year we 
scored very well in most of the key measures or statements. 
For example our overall engagement score increased by 8%, 
and 77% of our employees who responded were extremely 
satisfied to work at Brit. Advocacy is an important measure for 
engagement and 86% of employees who responded would 
now recommend Brit as a great place to work, with 85% being 
proud to work here. 
Our culture is communicated and lived through an established 
framework that identifies and rewards strong performance. 
Business plan goals are aligned to our Group vision and used to 
determine individuals’ objectives, ensuring that all employees 
understand the part they play in the Group’ s success. 
We are committed to developing the technical, behavioural, 
management and leadership skills required for our teams 
to outperform – both individually and collectively. During 
2014 senior managers (including the Executive Management 
Committee (EMC)) received 360 degree feedback to further 
develop self-awareness and leadership skills. We are also 
investing in the future of Brit through our graduate and intern 
programmes and our bi-annual succession and talent mapping 
exercise, all of which aim to grow expertise from within and 
ensure robust succession plans.
We have attained Chartered Insurer status for Brit Syndicates 
Limited through the Chartered Insurance Institute. This prestigious 
designation signifies to our customers – and the market – that 
we are committed to the pursuit of the highest standards and 
demonstrates our adherence to ethical good practice.
In 2014 we continued to focus on our employees’ work/
life balance. Initiatives to support this include increasing the 
standard annual holiday allowance from 25 to 27 days and 
giving employees the option of purchasing additional holiday. 
We also enhanced our maternity and paternity packages, 
introduced dental cover for UK-based employees and ran  
a series of healthcare presentations. 
At the beginning of 2014 we established a social committee. 
This cross-functional group organised a range of social, 
community and charitable events for employees during the 
year. In addition to the Social Committee events, employees 
were also invited to participate in sailing events in the Solent 
during which more than 60 employees from around the 
world learned how to sail and race against each other. This    Brit PLC Annual Report 2014 67
STRATEGIC REPORT
developed their team and communication skills and was a 
fantastic opportunity for employees to mix together and meet 
people from other offices.
The 2014 staff turnover rate excluding retirements and 
redundancies was 6.8% (2013: 10.9%).
At 31 December 2014, 33.9% (2013: 36.8%) of staff had 
completed at least five years of service and 11.6% (2013: 
12.1%) had served at least ten years.
Employee gender diversity
We consider Brit an equal opportunities employer with policies 
and procedures that are free from discrimination in relation to 
all employment matters. Our equal opportunities policy aims 
to ensure that no employee, or potential employee, receives 
less favourable treatment because of his or her gender 
(including gender reassignment). The gender diversity of our 
employees at 31 December, including non-executive directors 
of all Group companies, is detailed in the table below.
Social, community and human rights
We are committed to supporting the communities in which we 
operate and charities that are meaningful to employees. Our 
objective is to select charitable giving and community projects 
based on three criteria: projects should be for a good cause 
and operate in an area relevant to us, financial involvement 
should be for the benefit of the good cause, and projects 
should offer alignment with our strategic priorities. 
During 2014 we supported ten charities (nine UK-based and 
one US-based) chosen by employees.  We donated a sum of 
money to each charity at the start of the year and continued 
with fund raising activities through the year, including a well-
attended quiz night. Our Social Committee also organised 
a number of volunteering days in the local community. We 
further promote staff involvement in the community by 
granting every employee two additional days of paid leave  
a year to volunteer their time to a registered local charity.
We also run a payroll giving scheme and match any money 
raised by employees participating in charitable events.

OUR PEOPLE, CULTURE, SOCIAL, COMMUNITY,  
HUMAN RIGHTS AND ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS
We support and operate our business in accordance with the 
Universal Declaration of Human Rights and take account of 
other internationally recognised and accepted human rights 
standards. This support is expressed through a number of our 
Group policies. 
Distributors, partners and suppliers
We distribute our products through a carefully selected 
group of brokers and intermediaries. We also outsource 
some of our claims handling operations. These relationships 
are managed by each of the underwriting business units to 
ensure that development and performance objectives are 
met. This approach helps to ensure that the needs of the 
ultimate customer are consistently met, enabling us to achieve 
sustainable and profitable growth. 
Our procurement team seeks to establish professional third 
party agreements that recognise and value the contribution 
made by our suppliers. Our procurement team is also involved 
in all major purchasing and contract decisions to ensure 
positive supplier relationship management throughout the life 
of the contract. We seek to pay all valid supplier invoices in a 
timely manner. 
Environmental responsibility 
During 2014 we recycled 26.0 tonnes of paper waste  
(2013: 30.0 tonnes). We sent approximately 158.3 tonnes of 
general waste to energy recycling (2013: 72 tonnes), recycled  
8.2 tonnes of glass (2013: 3.6 tonnes), 25.8 tonnes of 
cardboard (2013: 20.4 tonnes) and 3.3 tonnes of food waste 
(2013: 2.4 tonnes). In 2014, in conjunction with our building 
managers, we continued to work hard to eliminate the waste 
sent to landfill. 
We continue to use a business dining and internal hospitality 
provider that is committed to the principles of sustainable 
food procurement. It recognises that it is important to the 
future wellbeing of the UK that farming communities are 
supported and able to contribute to its supply chains.
During 2014 we have made significantly greater use of the 
video conference facilities resulting in 455 tonnes of travel 
carbon avoided and on average 423 travel man hours avoided 
each month. Following the installation of LED lighting, longer-
lasting and more efficient bulbs together with motion sensors 
in the 2012 refurbishment of our London office, our electricity 
consumption has reduced by 9%.
We measure and monitor our carbon footprint. In 2014 our 
carbon emissions per employee reduced by 12.7% to  
4.1 tonnes (2013: 4.7 tonnes). This reduction was driven by 
both increased employees and a reduced carbon footprint. 
The sources of these emissions were as follows:
   2014 2013

Gas  5 1

CORPORATE GOVERNANCE REPORT
CHAIRMAN’S OVERVIEW 
Dear shareholder
On behalf of the Board, I am pleased to introduce the first 
Corporate Governance Report of the Company. It has been a 
significant year for the Company coming to the market via its 
IPO in April 2014. The report covers the period from 2 April 
2014 when the Company was admitted to the official list, 
through to the end of the financial year.
As a Board we are committed to high standards of corporate 
governance and to maintaining a strong framework for 
the control and management of the business. The Group’s 
insurance business is regulated by the Prudential Regulation 
Authority (PRA) and the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA). 
Accordingly, many of the corporate governance structures 
required of a public company were already well established 
within the Group at the time of the IPO. 
The Board takes seriously its commitment to corporate 
governance, as laid down in the UK Corporate Governance 
Code (the Code), but we are mindful that there are two major 
shareholders, Apollo and CVC, who own 39.7% and 33.6% of 
the Company respectively. 
The Board has recognised that the Company is not fully 
compliant with all the provisions of the Code, as further 
discussed on page 73 (Compliance with the Code) but the 
Board was mindful that the views of both Apollo and CVC 
needed to be taken into consideration when drawing up the 
Company’s own governance plans that were discussed in 
detail by the Board at the time of the IPO. 
Over time we expect the Company to undergo a change in 
its ownership structure and, as the position evolves, the Board 
will keep its governance codes under review with the intention 
of becoming fully compliant with the Code. 
Details of the activities of the Board and its committees are set 
out on page 73.
Dr Richard Ward
Chairman
24 February 2015 Brit PLC  Annual Report 2014     73     
GOVERNANCE
COMPLIANCE WITH THE CODE
The Financial Conduct Authority requires listed companies to 
disclose whether they have complied with the provisions of the 
Code throughout the year. 
Other than as set out in the following two paragraphs, from 
admission the Company has complied with the requirements 
of the Code, which sets out standards of good practice in 
relation to board leadership and effectiveness, remuneration, 
accountability and relations with shareholders.
The Code recommends, in the case of a FTSE 350 company, 
that at least half of the board of directors (excluding the 
chairman) should comprise ‘Independent’ non-executive 
directors, being individuals determined by the board to 
be independent in character and judgement and free from 
relationships or circumstances which may affect, or could 
appear to affect, their objectivity. From admission, the 
Company did not comply with this aspect of the Code, 
because out of its nine Directors (being the Board excluding 
the Chairman), only four non-executive Directors are  
deemed by the Board to be independent. The Board expects 
this position to change over time either by virtue of new 
appointments or if the major shareholders sell down their 
interests below the prevailing thresholds.
The PLC Audit, Remuneration and Nomination Committees 
were not fully compliant with the Code due to the number 
of shareholder representative non-executive Directors who 
are members of these committees. The Board have noted 
that both Apollo and CVC, as joint shareholders of the 
Company prior to its IPO, were responsible in helping the 
Company’s restructuring and return to sustained profitability 
that ultimately led to the Company’s successful return to the 
London Stock Exchange in April 2014. The Board believes that 
the shareholder representative Directors continue to add value 
to the Company and the deliberations of the Board and that, 
while they continue as shareholders of the Company,  
they should be represented on the Board and its committees.
BOARD OF DIRECTORS
Introduction
The Board of Directors currently comprises ten Directors; 
a non-executive Chairman, one executive Director, four 
independent non–executive Directors and four shareholder 
representative Directors. All of the Directors were appointed 
to the Board prior to the Company’s IPO and had all previously 
been board members of one of the Group’s intermediate 
holding companies, Brit Insurance Holdings B.V ., a company 
incorporated in the Netherlands. The Board meet on a regular 
basis and meetings include a private session with only the 
Chairman and the non-executive Directors present.
The biography of each Director is set out on pages 70 and 71. 
Independence of Directors
The Board considers that Ipe Jacob, Hans-Peter Gerhardt, 
Maarten Hulshoff and Willem Stevens are independent non-
executive Directors of the Company, within the meaning of the 
Code. None of the independent non-executive Directors has 
any executive or other role or relationship with the Company 
or management that would affect their objectivity and all have 
proven to be independent in character and judgement.
On an annual basis, each Board member receives for 
completion a questionnaire to determine factors that may 
affect independence according to best practice statements 
laid out in the Code. The responses to the questionnaires 
assist the Board in ascertaining whether a Director is 
independent in character and judgement and whether there 
are any relationships or circumstances, which are likely to 
affect, or could appear to affect, the Director’s judgement.
The independent non-executive Directors bring a wide range 
of experience and expertise both in the insurance and financial 
services industries. The independent non-executive Directors 
are encouraged to challenge management and help develop 
proposals on strategy. 
Ipe Jacob also serves as an independent non-executive 
director on the board of Brit Syndicates Limited and as 
chairman of the BIG and UK audit committees. Mr Jacob is 
also chairman of the BIG Risk Oversight Committee and a 
member of the UK Risk Oversight Committee.
Dr Richard Ward, non-executive Chairman, was independent 
on his appointment as a Director of the Company in March 
2014 and he remains non-executive. 
The Chairman is also the non-executive chairman of BSL.  
The contributions of both the Chairman and Ipe Jacob at 
these regulated insurance companies are of significant benefit 
to the Group.
The Board considers that Jonathan Feuer, Sachin Khajuria, 
Gernot Lohr and Kamil Salame are not independent 
non-executive Directors as a consequence of their being 
representative Directors of the major shareholders.
The Chairman 
The Chairman is responsible for leadership of the Board ensuring 
its effectiveness on all aspects of its role and setting its agenda. 
The Chairman is responsible for setting the agenda for Board 
deliberations, with the help of the executive Directors and 
the Company Secretary, to be primarily focused on strategy, 
performance, value creation and accountability, and ensure that 
issues relevant to these areas are reserved for Board decision.
The Chief Executive Officer
The Chief Executive Officer is responsible for implementing 
and executing the strategy of the Group and for generally 
running the Group’s business. The Chief Executive Officer also 
chairs the Executive Management Committee.
Senior independent non-executive Director
The Board has appointed Ipe Jacob as the senior independent 
non-executive Director of the Company. The role of the senior 
independent non-executive Director is to provide a conduit 
through which shareholders can express concerns where 
contact through normal channels of the Chairman and of 
the Chief Executive Officer may not have been appropriate 
or failed to resolve any of those concerns. The senior 
independent Director was also responsible for carrying out the 
evaluation of the role of the Chairman during the year. 74     Brit PLC  Annual Report 2014
Non-executive Directors 
The non-executive Directors are encouraged to challenge 
management, provide insight and help develop proposals  
on strategy.

Company Secretary
All the Directors have access to the services of the Company 
Secretary. The appointment and the removal of the Company 
Secretary is a matter for the Board as a whole under the 
direction of the Chairman. The Company Secretary is 
responsible for:
• Ensuring good information flows within the Board,  
its Committees and between senior management and  
non-executive Directors;
• Facilitating the induction programme for non-executive 
Directors of the Company and assisting with professional 
development;
• Advising the Board or a committee of the Board on 
corporate governance matters; and
• Ensuring that Board procedures are complied with.
Independent advice
After consulting with the Chairman, acting individually or 
jointly and at the Company’s expense, all Directors are 
authorised to obtain external legal or professional advice 
on any matter, where they judge such advice necessary to 
discharge their responsibilities as Directors.
Directors’ reappointment
In accordance with Code provision B7.2. all executive and non-
executive Directors will retire and offer themselves for reappoint-
ment at the 2015 annual general meeting of the Company.
Information provided to the Directors
Each Director is provided with tailored packs for all Board 
or committee meetings which they are required to attend. 
Board packs are delivered at least one week prior to each 
meeting. The Company has adopted an electronic system 
whereby Directors’ packs are accessible and available via a 
secure online tool. Directors regularly receive information 
between Board meetings, including the monthly management 
information pack. Where a Director was unable to attend 
a meeting, they were provided with all the papers and 
information relating to that meeting and were able to discuss 
issues arising directly with the Chairman.
Conflicts of interest
Under the Companies Act 2006, all Directors must seek 
authorisation before taking up any position with another 
company that conflicts or may possibly conflict with the 
Company’s interests. The Company’s Articles of Association 
contain provisions that allow the Directors to authorise 
situations of potential conflicts of interest, so that a Director is 
not in breach of his duty under company law. The Directors are 
required to notify the Company of any conflicts so that they 
can be considered and if appropriate authorised by the Board. 
The Board carries out an annual review of conflicts of interest 
and each authorisation is set out in the conflicts register.
During the year the Chairman was appointed as the executive 
chairman of Cunningham Lindsey Group, an insurance services 
provider. Prior to his appointment, the Board concluded that he 
would remain able to devote sufficient time and commitment to 
his role with the Company, whilst serving as executive chairman 
of Cunningham Lindsey Group and that no conflict arose from 
this position. The Board still considers that to be the case.
Directors’ and officers’ insurance and indemnity
The Company maintains a Directors’ and Officers’ liability 
insurance policy which meets defence costs on behalf of a 
Director and Officer, when they are found not to have acted 
fraudulently.

GOVERNANCE
In addition, to the Company’s governance structure, the Group 
also has structures in place for its UK and Gibraltar based 
regulated entities.
• UK 
UK underwriting and investment operations are subject 
to governance provided by the board of Brit Syndicates 
Limited, the managing agent for Lloyd’s Syndicate 2987, 
and a number of committees. The BSL board consists of ten 
directors, three of whom are non-executive, and is chaired 
by the Chairman of the Company. The UK also operates an 
Audit Committee, Risk Oversight Committee, Underwriting 
Committee and Investment Committee. 
• Gibraltar 
Brit Insurance (Gibraltar) PCC Limited (BIG) is a captive 
insurance company based in Gibraltar and regulated 
by the Gibraltar Financial Services Commission (FSC). 
Its only activities are providing reinsurance to Syndicate 
2987 and Brit UW Limited, and the management of its 
own investment portfolios. In addition to its own board, 
it operates three board committees: the BIG Audit 
Committee, the BIG Risk Oversight Committee and the  
BIG Investment Committee. 
The committees within the UK and Gibraltar report to their 
PLC counterparties on a regular basis.
BOARD INTERNAL CONTROL STATEMENT
The Board recognises its responsibility for the Group’s risk 
management and internal control systems. It has complied 
with principle C.2 of the Code by establishing a continuous 
process for identifying, evaluating and managing the principal 
risks facing the Group. This also includes risks arising from 
social, environmental and ethical matters, in accordance with 
the Turnbull Report.
Directors are aware that any internal control system is 
designed to manage, rather than eliminate, the risk of failure 
to achieve business objectives. They understand that the 
systems can only provide reasonable, and not absolute, 
assurance against material misstatement or financial loss. In 
the Strategic Report, the principal risks to which the business 
is exposed, are set out on pages 60 to 65 and further 
information is provided on how the Company has maintained 
a sound system of internal controls to safeguard shareholders’ 
investment and the Company’s assets.
The PLC Risk Oversight Committee regularly reviews the 
effectiveness of the Group’s risk management system on the 
Board’s behalf. The PLC Audit Committee regularly reviews 
the Group’s financial reports, financial reporting process, 
regulatory and compliance matters. If significant control 
failings or weaknesses are identified, they are reported by 
management, via risk management, the compliance function 
or internal audit to the relevant committee. The relevant 
committee also receives regular reports on remediation 
work and discussions with other interested parties, such as 
regulators.
RISK MANAGEMENT
Managed by the Chief Risk Officer and Director of Strategy, 
our risk management function oversees the management 
of risk, ensuring each operating entity manages its risk in 
accordance with Group policies and allocated risk tolerances 
and appetites. The PLC Risk Oversight Committee reviews 
reports from the risk management function and considers 
appropriate executive actions. Additionally, each regulated 
subsidiary’s board is responsible for overseeing its risk, 
supported by its own risk oversight committee.
RISK ASSESSMENT
The Group’s risk assessment process includes using an 
enterprise risk management (ERM) system. The ERM system 
reports on every significant identified risk to achieving 
Group objectives, the nature and effectiveness of controls, 
and other management processes to manage these risks. 
The Company sets risk tolerances for key risk categories, for 
example, catastrophe, reserving, investment and operational 
risk. The risk management framework encompasses self-
assessment of controls by risk owners throughout the 
business, which go through various levels of review, at which 
their assertions are independently challenged. The internal 
audit function regularly reviews the risks identified by risk 
owners and the effectiveness of their controls and operation.
The Own Risk and Solvency Assessment (ORSA) processes 
cover the Group’s risk and solvency performance. The 
Group operates an Internal Model that captures the key 
economic and risk factors that could impact the Group’s 
performance. The ORSA process runs quarterly and is used 
to escalate significant risks, their potential impact on the 
Group’s financial position, any variations from the agreed 
risk appetites, and the actions to manage those risks. The 
Group Executive Management Committee and the PLC Risk 
Oversight Committee review the output from the ORSA 
processes.
 
INTERNAL AUDIT AND COMPLIANCE
The Group’s internal audit and compliance departments 
perform our internal audits and compliance monitoring 
respectively. Both departments have a reporting line to the 
PLC Audit Committee. Internal audit also reports to the 
Chief Executive Officer, while the compliance department 
reports to the Group Director of Legal and Compliance. 
The Group has established risk-based audit and compliance 
programmes for reviewing and evaluating the internal 
controls and compliance procedures used to manage risk. 78     Brit PLC  Annual Report 2014
NOMINATIONS COMMITTEE REPORT
CHAIRMAN’S OVERVIEW
Dear shareholder
The Nominations Committee was formed following the IPO of 
the Company in April 2014 and I am delighted to present this 
report to you. 
As noted earlier in this section the Committee is aware that 
the Company does not currently comply with the Code 
provision B.1.2 for half the Board, excluding the Chairman, to 
comprise non-executive Directors determined by the Board to 
be independent. The Board currently comprises ten Directors; 
myself as Chairman; one executive Director; four independent 
non-executive Directors; and four non-executive shareholder 
representative Directors.
The Committee has evaluated the balance of skills, 
experience, independence and knowledge of the current 
Board of Directors. The Committee considers that the 
Company has a diverse board, with a mix of broad business 
and geographical experience, but is aware of the need 
to develop its gender diversity. With this in mind we have 
identified and commenced a recruitment exercise to appoint 
two non-executive Directors to the Board, one of whom, or 
preferably both should be female.
In order to assist the Committee with its search, the 
Committee contacted a number of external search consultants 
who were invited to provide a specification and brief for 
the project under consideration. These proposals were then 
considered by the Committee and The Miles Partnership was 
appointed to assist the Company in its search for independent 
non-executive directors to be appointed to the Board. 
The Miles Partnership have no other relationship with the 
Company. 
Although the Company is only in its infancy as a public listed 
entity, a Board evaluation was conducted in the year. All of 
the Directors of the Company were sent a questionnaire to 
complete and then one to one meetings were held between 
myself and each Director of the Company. In respect of my 
own evaluation, this took place at the end of a Board meeting 
at which I was not present and was led by Ipe Jacob as senior 
independent non-executive Director.
During the evaluation, consideration was given to the extent 
to which there may be an overlap in review and challenge of 
performance of the parent Company Board and the board of 
BSL, and it was recommended that there should be a review 
of the reports presented to each Board and their various 
committees to ensure that they were clear, concise, consistent 
and specifically relevant to the bodies terms of reference.
The Board considered that it and the Board committees 
were effective and had a sufficient balance of skills and 
experience to enable them to discharge their responsibilities 
appropriately. It also concluded that there was an appropriate 
level of challenge and discussion to enable the Board and its 
committees to work effectively as a unit.
As a Committee we will continue to focus on the structure of 
the Board and focus on executive succession planning in 2015.

Area Comment
Board induction The Committee reviewed the induction programme developed for non-executive directors that 
are appointed to the Board. The induction programme sets out detailed information that a  
non-executive Director should receive on his/her appointment to the Company and identifies 
those senior executives within the Company with whom the Director should meet, to gain a 
better understanding of the business and its operations.
Board recruitment The Committee considered the balance of skills on the Board, the Company’s commitment to 
comply with the Code and recognised the need to appoint two Independent non-executive 
Directors to the Board. The Committee identified areas where the Board may be lacking in 
particular skill sets and agreed a specification for each of the non-executive Directors that the 
Board was looking to recruit. The Miles Partnership were selected to support the Committee in 
its search.
Diversity The Committee noted that the members of the Board have a mix of broad business and 
geographical experience and the skills and knowledge that they bring to the deliberations of the 
Board make for a diverse board. 
Board evaluation The Committee concluded that as the Company had only recently undergone an IPO that an 
internal review should be conducted in 2014 and would give consideration to an external review 
in 2015. The results of the 2014 evaluation concluded that the Board was performing well and 
discussions at Board meetings were positive. Points for future consideration have been discussed 
earlier in the report.
The Chief Executive Officer attends every meeting of the 
Nomination Committee and other members of the executive 
team are invited to provide technical input when required.
The role of the Committee
The Chairman reports regularly to the Board on its activities. 
The Committee’s responsibilities are set out in the main 
terms of reference which are available for shareholders on the 
Company’s website. Its main duties include:
• Regularly review the structure, size and composition 
(including the skills, knowledge, independence, experience 
and diversity) required of the Board compared with its 
current position and make recommendations to the Board 
with regard to any changes; 
• Give full consideration to succession planning for Directors 
and other senior executives in the course of the work of the 
Nomination Committee, taking into account the challenges 
and opportunities facing the Company, and the skills and 
expertise that will, therefore, be needed on the Board in 
the future; 
• Any matters relating to the continuation in office of any 
Director at any time including the suspension or termination 
of service of an executive Director as an employee of the 
Company subject to the provisions of the law and their 
service contract;
• The appointment of any Director to executive or other 
office; and
• Ensuring that the evaluation of the Board is externally 
facilitated at least every three years and reviewing the 
results of the Board performance evaluation process that 
relate to the composition of the Board.

AUDIT COMMITTEE REPORT
CHAIRMAN’S OVERVIEW
Dear Shareholder
Following Brit PLC’s IPO in April 2014, I was delighted to 
be appointed Chairman of the Audit Committee. I have 
been associated with the Brit Group since 2012, both as a 
non-executive director of Brit Insurance Holdings B.V . and 
as chairman of its audit committee. As part of my ongoing 
responsibilities, I also chair the audit committees of Brit’s two 
main sub-groups, focusing on the Group’s UK and Gibraltar 
based regulated entities.
The Committee’s focus in 2014 has been on sound financial 
reporting, underpinned by a strong control environment. To 
support this focus we:
• Considered and provided challenge around significant 
financial reporting issues;
• Reviewed the effectiveness of the Group’s current internal 
control regimes;
• Reviewed the Company’s interim management statements, 
interim report, and Annual Report and recommended their 
approval to the Board; 
• Monitored progress against the internal audit plan for 2014;
• Reviewed and approved the internal audit plan for 2015; 
and
• Conducted internal and external audit effectiveness 
reviews. 
In addition to these activities, the Committee recommend 
the appointment of auditors and the approval of their audit 
fees. We also took the decision to embark on an audit tender 
process during 2015. 
As part of our review of the Annual Report and Accounts we 
have, at the request of the Board, considered whether the 
document as a whole is fair, balanced and understandable and 
provides the information necessary for shareholders to assess 
the Company’s performance, business model and strategy. 
Following our review, we have concluded that the Annual 
Report and Accounts does meet these criteria and we have 
provided positive assurance to the Board in this regard.
I believe an ongoing dialogue with all key parties is important 
to help me and the Committee maintain an awareness and 
understanding of the organisation, the risks and challenges 
it faces, and the environment in which it operates. To help 
achieve this, in addition to the formal private meetings with 
our external auditors, the Head of Internal Audit and Brit’s 
executives, I also meet with each of them informally on a 
regular basis. To facilitate full and open discussion, these 
informal meetings take place away from Brit’s offices and 
without the rigidity of a formal agenda.
I also believe that the culture of an organisation is important 
and that the right culture helps embed the principles of 
ownership, accountability and openness. The Committee 
members and I have spent time understanding and assessing 
the culture of the organisation and we believe that these 
principles are embedded in the way Brit operates, thereby 
helping to maintain an effective control environment. 
In the report below, you can read more about the Committee, 
our work in 2014 and our areas of focus for 2015. 
During the year we have also assessed the effectiveness of our 
Committee. I am pleased to report that this evaluation process 
concluded that the Committee was operating effectively. More 
details can be found in 78.

2014 focus
Financial reporting
The Committee’s main financial reporting focus was on the 
integrity of the Company’s Annual Report, its interim report 
and its interim management statements. The Committee 
receives a twice-yearly ‘Key Accounting Judgements’ report 
from the Group Financial Controller setting out the significant 
assumptions, judgements and estimates supporting the 
Company’s reported figures.  82     Brit PLC  Annual Report 2014
These areas of judgement are discussed both with management and the external auditor and are challenged where appropriate. 
The Committee also considers whether such key judgements are satisfactorily disclosed in the Annual Report and Accounts. 
In addition, the Committee receives a twice-yearly report from the external auditor which presents its key audit findings. 
The Committee pays particular attention to the issues raised in these reports, discusses and challenges them to ensure the 
assumptions, judgements and estimates used are appropriate and justified. It also ensures that appropriate disclosure is made.
The significant issues considered for 2014 were: 
Risk Details
Income 
estimation
Please see page 133 (accounting policy), page 142 (critical accounting estimates) and page 178 (disclosures).
The Group applies certain assumptions and estimation techniques in the earnings patterns of premiums and 
the setting of premium estimates. These assumptions are particularly relevant for business written through 
delegated authorities. There is a risk that the estimate and actual premiums realised are materially different.
The Group also assesses whether there are adequate levels of risk transfer in the insurance contracts it writes.
The Committee has:
• Reviewed the controls operated in this area and the income recognition judgements made; and
• Reviewed the findings arising from the work performed by the external auditors.
Following these reviews, the Committee has concluded that the recognition of premiums in the Financial 
Statements is appropriate.
Reserving 
risk
Please see page 134 (accounting policy), page 141 (critical accounting estimates) and page 178 (disclosures).
The Group has exposure to liabilities arising from risks written which can be difficult to estimate due to the 
level of subjectivity and uncertainty involved. As a result, there is a risk that the ultimate outcome could be 
materially different from the claims reserves carried. 
Brit’s reserving process is robust and managed by the Chief Actuary, under the oversight of the Executive 
Management Committee and the boards of the two regulated entities of the Group. In considering whether 
the level of reserves resulting from this process is appropriate, the Committee has:
• Considered the Chief Actuary’s reserving report;
• Reviewed and challenged key reserving judgements;
• Reviewed the findings of the work performed by the external auditors, including their testing of the key 
controls, their evaluation of management’s methodology, key assumptions and major sensitivities and the 
outcome of their re-projection of the reserves; and
• Considered the appropriateness of the explicit risk margin.
As a result of this work, the Committee is satisfied that the level of reserves determined by management 
is appropriate. The Committee has also reviewed related disclosures as set out in Note 21 of the Financial 
Statements and has concluded that they are also appropriate.
Investment 
valuation
Please see page 135 (accounting policy), page 142 (critical accounting estimates) and page 186 (disclosures).
Brit has realigned its investment strategy and has transitioned to a broader mix of asset classes. This has 
resulted in the Group increasing its holdings in instruments such as structured products, loan portfolios and 
investment funds. Quoted prices may not always be available for these instruments therefore alternative 
valuation techniques may need to be applied.
The Committee has:
• Evaluated and challenged the process used by management in valuing these investments; and 
• Reviewed the findings of the work performed by the external auditors, including their testing of the key 
controls around management’s valuation process and controls over information provided by investment 
managers. 
As a result of this work, the Committee is satisfied that the valuation of the Group’s investments as 
determined by management is appropriate. The Committee has also reviewed the related disclosures in  
the Annual Report and has concluded that they are also appropriate.
AUDIT COMMITTEE REPORT  Brit PLC  Annual Report 2014     83     
GOVERNANCE
Annual Report and Accounts 
The Committee has also devoted significant time to reviewing 
the Company’s Annual Report and Accounts, the first since the 
Company listed on the London Stock Exchange. In late 2014 
and early 2015 additional Audit Committee meetings were 
convened to review a number of working drafts and to allow 
its challenge and feedback to be considered at appropriate 
stages of the report’s development. The Committee also 
received briefings on the relevant statutory requirements 
and current best practice guidelines, and solicited the 
views of the external auditor. Following this process, the 
Committee concluded that the Annual Report and Accounts 
as a whole is fair, balanced and understandable and provides 
the information necessary for shareholders to assess the 
Company’s performance, business model and strategy. 
Internal control and compliance 
The Committee believes an effective control environment is 
important to help manage the Group’s risk, particularly with 
respect to misstatement or loss, and to support true and fair 
financial reporting. 
The Committee reviews the effectiveness of the Group’s 
financial controls. It receives and debates a quarterly report 
on the performance of financial controls and an annual 
report on their effectiveness. It also discusses any control 
issues highlighted in internal audit reports and in any reports 
presented by the external auditor, and then monitors the 
remedying of any such issues. Following its review, the 
Committee has concluded that the Group maintains a 
comprehensive and effective financial control framework which 
supports approval of the 2014 Financial Statements.
The Committee reviews and monitors the work of compliance. 
A written report from the Head of Compliance is received 
quarterly, which the Committee reviews, discusses and 
challenges as appropriate. This report includes an update on 
all key compliance risks. It also includes an update on relevant 
issues arising in each of the Group’s regulatory jurisdictions 
including the UK, the US and Gibraltar. 
During the period, in addition to reviewing the Head of 
Compliance’s report, the Committee:
• Reviewed and challenged the Group’s sanctions monitoring 
procedures; and 
• Examined and approved the Group financial crime policy; 
and
• Reviewed and agreed the Group’s whistleblowing process.
Internal Audit
The Committee reviews and monitors the work of internal 
audit. A written report from the Head of Internal Audit is 
discussed at each meeting. This report includes an update on 
the current audit plan, the findings and actions arising from 
completed reports, an update on the completion of actions 
and an update on all ongoing audits. The Committee also 
holds regular private sessions with the Head of Internal Audit.
During the period, the Committee:
• Reviewed, debated and approved the internal audit charter, 
a new risk-based internal audit planning methodology and 
revisions to the internal audit methodology;
• Monitored progress against the 2014 internal audit plan 
and discussed and approved amendments to the plan;
• Reviewed and discussed all internal audit reports and 
monitored progress of addressing issues arising from those 
reports; 
• Reviewed, discussed, challenged and approved the 2015 
internal audit plan; and
• Reviewed the effectiveness of internal audit and concluded 
that it was operating effectively. In addition to this internal 
performance evaluation, an external assessment of internal 
audit will be conducted at least once every five years 
by a qualified independent assessor from outside of the 
organisation.
External audit
Assessing the effectiveness of the audit
The Committee is committed to ensuring the external audit 
process is effective and independent and uses an audit 
quality framework assessment to help achieve this. The 
Committee reviews the effectiveness of the external audit 
process throughout the year and has also undertaken a formal 
assessment. This assessment involved:
• Canvassing and analysing the views of the Committee 
and senior management by way of a comprehensive 
questionnaire;
• Reviewing the quality and scope of the audit planning 
document and subsequent planning updates;
• Reviewed reports and other documents presented by the 
auditor to the Committee;
• Monitoring the auditor’s independence; and
• Discussing with EY the report published by the FRC on its 
2013/14 inspection of Ernst & Young LLP .
The observations and findings of the assessment were 
presented to and discussed by the Committee who concluded 
that the external audit process was effective. 
Auditor appointment
The current EY group engagement partner is signing the audit 
report of Brit PLC for the first time for the 2014 year end. 
However, as he has previously held partner responsibilities 
in respect of a sub-section of the Group, consistent with the 
provisions in Ethical Standard 3 he will rotate off the account 
when the 2014 audit process is complete. This will help 
maintain auditor independence. A new engagement partner 
has been proposed by EY and has been approved by the 
Audit Committee. Monitoring the transition to the new partner 
is a key objective for 2015 and, to help facilitate a smooth 
transition, the new proposed partner has attended Audit 
Committee meetings during 2014 at the chairman’s invitation.
In accordance with section 489 of the Companies Act 2006, 
a resolution proposing the re-appointment of Ernst & Young 
LLP (EY) as Group auditor will be put to the shareholders at the 
2015 annual general meeting. 84     Brit PLC  Annual Report 2014
EY was appointed Brit PLC’s external auditor on 3 March 2014. 
We are mindful and supportive of the new requirements on 
auditor appointment from the EU which requires Brit PLC 
to rotate its auditor every ten years. However, as EY have 
performed the audit of Brit PLC’s predecessor companies since 
2005, the Audit Committee intends to commence a qualifying 
audit tender process in 2015 for the appointment of the Group 
auditor for the 2016 year.
Non-audit services
The Audit Committee monitors the use of the external 
auditors for non-audit services to ensure compliance with our 
policy, which details the circumstances in which the auditors 
may be permitted to undertake non-audit work for the Group. 
Non-audit services permitted in the policy include transaction 
due diligence, tax advice, actuarial review, accountancy 
training and accounting advice. Services prohibited in 
the policy include preparing statutory accounts, selecting 
accounting policies, designing and implementing internal 
controls, process and financial information systems, and 
valuation services.
The authorisation limits for non-audit services allowed by  
the policy are:
Once non-audit services in any one year exceed £500,000,  
all further non-audit services need to be approved by the 
Audit Committee.
This policy aims to ensure that the independence of the 
external auditors is maintained and that we comply with all 
relevant legislation relating to non-audit services.
The fees paid to our auditors are set out in Note 13 to the 
accounts. Non-audit fees amounted to £3.4m, of which 
£2.9m related to our IPO in April 2014. The Committee 
approved these IPO related transaction services in advance 
after considering the impact of this work on the auditor’s 
independence, its level of expertise and understanding of the 
Group, and its ability to provide these services on a timely and 
cost effective basis.

AUDIT COMMITTEE REPORT
During the year, the auditors undertook the following 
significant non-audit work: Brit PLC  Annual Report 2014     85     
GOVERNANCE
Dear Shareholder
The Brit PLC Risk Oversight Committee was formally 
established as a result of the Company’ s listing in April 2014. 
While the PLC committee is newly established, a separate Risk 
Committee has been in place at Brit since 2012 and has played 
a key part of the risk governance at Brit. The risk oversight 
committee meets at least four times a year and reports directly 
to the PLC Board.
I have been a member of the Brit Group risk committees since 
2012, serving as a member or chairman on the Syndicate, 
Gibraltar and Group Risk Oversight Committees. The risk 
committees benefit from experienced non-executive directors 
with a broad base of knowledge and experience at both a 
Group and a regulated entity level. The Chief Risk Officer 
attends the committee and other relevant experts attend to 
provide technical input as required.
Overview
Brit’ s risk governance is well embedded in the business, with 
established committees and a strong Risk Management 
Framework. The Chief Risk Officer provides an independent 
quarterly report to the Risk Oversight Committee, while other 
members of the management and risk team regularly present 
on topical issues and when requested by the committee. The 
Chief Risk Officer’ s report sets out the risk profile of the Group 
and include a risk dashboard showing exposure compared to 
Board-approved tolerance. The Committee has used Brit’s 
established processes to effectively discharge its duties balancing 
ongoing risk management and compliance-related activity.
As I mentioned in my introduction to the Audit Committee 
Report, I believe an ongoing dialogue with all relevant parties 
is important to maintain an awareness and understanding of 
the organisation, the risks and challenges it faces, and the 
environment in which it operates. T o help achieve this I hold 
both regular formal private meetings and regular informal 
off-site meetings with each relevant party including the Chief 
Risk Officer, other members of the Brit executive and senior 
management team and the Group’ s external auditor. 
2014 activities and focus 
The key areas of focus for the committee in 2014 have been:
• Implementation of Solvency II: The Committee continued 
to oversee the implementation of Solvency II across the 
Group with the deadline of 1 January 2016 approaching. The 
preparations for the Syndicate are now close to completion 
in line with the Lloyd’ s deadline for compliance with full tests 
and standards. Implementation in Gibraltar is well advanced 
and on track to meet the full Solvency II requirements in 
2015. The Group overall has made a significant investment in 
the implementation of Solvency II over recent years and the 
benefits can now be clearly seen through a much improved 
risk management framework and transparent risk reporting 
throughout the organisation. The Syndicate is rated ‘green’ 
by Lloyd’ s for Solvency II preparedness.
• Development and oversight of the internal model 
process: The Internal Model is used throughout the Group 
as part of the management capital setting, risk monitoring, 
strategic analysis and assessing the assumptions used in 
the business plan. Brit now uses an internal model in both 
the Syndicate and Gibraltar to set its entity management 
capital. The Committee takes an active part in challenging 
the model parameters through the validation process and 
receives a quarterly report summarising any model uses  
and changes.
• Operating and improving the risk management 
framework: The Committee reviews the risk management 
framework regularly. The risk appetite framework was 
improved in 2014 for insurance and credit risk which 
included the introduction of additional earnings metrics and 
modification of the metrics already in place. The Group has 
also continued to improve the processes supporting the 
risk management framework such as the management of 
the operational risk around the investment and catastrophe 
modelling capabilities. We believe we are now well positioned 
and have fully embedded the principles and practices of risk 
management in the business. The processes are now business 
as usual as the Syndicate has been running its ORSA and SCR 
processes under the risk management framework since 2012.
• Challenging the management team across all areas of 
the business: A major role of the Committee is to monitor 
and challenge the executive management’ s approach to 
managing the current and emerging risk profile of the 
business. The Committee has dedicated time to reviewing 
all areas of the business, with a particular focus in 2014 on 
catastrophe risk, investment risk and the market outlook, 
including challenging the business plan.
• Monitoring the response to new and emerging risks 
within the business: The Committee also monitors the use 
of the risk and solvency processes and in 2014 there was 
strong evidence that these are well embedded at Brit. In 
particular, assessments were completed for a number of the 
initiatives undertaken during the year including:
 – New business initiatives such as the acquisition of the  
renewal rights of QBE’ s Lloyd’ s aviation portfolio;
 – Commutation of the reinsurance contract with RiverStone 
Insurance Limited;
 – Optimisation of the outwards reinsurance programme; 
and
 – Assessment of options to manage foreign exchange and 
interest rate risks.
In the current regulatory and market environment I believe the 
Risk Oversight Committee has an increasingly important role 
to play in maintaining discipline and focus on the principal and 
emerging risks facing the business both in the short and longer 
term. It is critical that Brit maintains its focus on compliance and 
Solvency II and these will continue to be priorities for the Committee. 
The Group has invested significantly in its risk framework and 
processes over the past three years and under this Committee’ s 
guidance we believe is well prepared for the future.

Solvency II compliance 
and development of 
capital requirements
As a critical deliverable for the Group, the Committee received regular updates on progress 
against the implementation plan and interactions with regulators. The process was well managed 
and Brit is in a good position to fully comply with the new regulations.
Use of the Internal 
Model and ORSA 
processes in the review

The ORSA processes were applied to strategic initiatives including the acquisition of the QBE 
aviation portfolio and a review of outwards reinsurance. The Committee monitored the use of the 
ORSA processes and Internal Model throughout the year.
Market conditions and 
business outlook
Market conditions are challenging in a number of areas. The Committee prioritised its review of 
the business plan and reviewed analysis from the Internal Model to understand the risk profile. 
In addition, stress and scenario and reverse stress tests were performed to understand potential 
risks to the plan. 88     Brit PLC  Annual Report 2014
Dear shareholder
I am pleased to present the first report of the Underwriting 
Committee. 
The role of the Underwriting Committee is to review, advise 
and make recommendations to the Board and management to 
inform the setting of strategy with a view to optimising Group 
underwriting performance.
The Committee is scheduled to meet five times a year but has 
met three times since the IPO of the Company in April. The 
attendance of the members of the Committee at meetings is 
set out in the table later in this report.
In addition to these three meetings, the Committee members 
were present at a Board underwriting strategy day in May 
2014. The Group’ s underwriting strategy was discussed in detail 
and the Committee members were given the opportunity to 
question and challenge the senior underwriters of the Group. 
The Committee is supported in its deliberations by the 
Chief Executive Officer of Brit Global Specialty who has 
responsibility for the underwriting business of the Company. 
I also meet regularly with portfolio directors to discuss their 
particular lines of business and issues that are effecting them. 
At its meetings the Committee reviews the underwriting 
KPIs that include volume measures such as premium and 
retention; distribution measures such as volumes and signing 
levels with key broking partners; pricing metrics such as rate 
change and pricing strength; and performance metrics such 
as loss ratios and cash flow. The Committee also reviews the 
key Underwriting Risk Metrics in particular the comparison of 
the Company’s exposure to natural catastrophe losses to the 
Board’s Risk Appetite. Complementing the KPI reviews, in line 
with the Group’s quarterly management reporting cycles, the 
Committee reviews the financial underwriting results of each 
business line including combined ratios and return on equity 
and monitors reserving developments. The Committee also 
reviews the Company’s underwriting performance relative to 
its peers.
In addition to the review of the activities of the incoming 
portfolios, the Committee also reviews the outwards 
reinsurance strategy to ensure that all classes are effectively 
protected. 
The Company carries out an annual underwriting business 
planning exercise which the Committee reviews, providing 
appropriate challenge around the underwriting plans in 
particular assumptions for premium volumes, rates and loss 
ratios.
The Company writes a broad range of products which due to 
market conditions will be at different stages in the insurance 
cycle. Where underwriting action has been instigated to 
improve the performance of a segment the Committee will ask 
for a detailed product line review and follow-up to ensure that 
the action has been effective.
The Committee is kept abreast of all new major products 
launched by the Company. For example, during the course 
of the year a cyber terrorism product was launched providing 
cover for industrial clients who face vulnerability to first party 
property damage as a result of having automated industrial 
control systems. The product was reviewed by the Committee 
with regards to the nature of the coverage, the intended 
customers, the Group’s risk appetite and the suitability of the 
associated outwards reinsurance protections.
The Committee also monitors the position of the Group’s 
major losses both in respect of the development of historic 
losses and also new events such as the Tripoli aviation war loss 
in 2014.
The Company has also established an underwriting committee 
for the Lloyd’s platform. This is a management committee that 
meets on a monthly basis and is responsible for reviewing the 
underwriting activities of Syndicate 2987. From time to time 
I attend these meetings, which provide valuable insight to 
the underwriting activities of the Syndicate. This committee 
reports to the Executive Management Committee and its 
minutes are tabled at meetings of the PLC Underwriting 
Committee.

The attendance of the Committee’s Chairman and members was as follows:
The Chief Investment Officer attends every meeting and other 
relevant experts attend to provide technical input as required. 
For example, members of the investment team attend the 
meetings. The Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer 
and Chief Risk Officer are regular attendees and other members 
of executive management regularly present on topical issues.
The Committee met three times in the year and the 
Committee Chairman also meets with the Chief Investment 
Officer without executive management being present.
The role of the Committee
The Chairman reports quarterly to the Board on the activities 
of the Committee. The Committee’s responsibilities are set out 
in its terms of reference which are available for shareholders 
on the Company’s website. They include:
• Review, advise and make recommendations to the Board 
and management to inform the setting of strategy with a 
view to optimising Group investment performance;
• Receive and review reports from, and the minutes of,  
the UK and BIG investment Committees; 
• Review quarterly investment results;
• Review quarterly investment risk tolerance and risk appetite 
metrics; and
• Enquire into any issue relating to the Group’s investment 
activities that it sees fit.
2014 activities and focus
The key areas of focus for the Committee in 2014 are set  
out below.
Area Comment
Strategy and 
performance
Reviewing the strategy and performance of the Group investment portfolio through the year. 
Providing challenge to the Chief Investment Officer and oversight of the strategic and tactical 
asset allocations and relative performance of our external investment managers.
Risk and ALM Independent risk reporting from the risk management department on the risk profile of the 
investment portfolio was presented at each meeting. The reports included the level of risk to 
reported earnings and the solvency position (both on a modelled and event basis), liquidity 
and where there were any material mismatches in the ALM profile. The Committee used these 
reports to gain assurance that the investment portfolio was being managed in line with the risk 
appetite and ALM guidelines prescribed in the Board approved investment policy.
Investment manager 
presentations
At each meeting one of our external managers was invited to present to the Committee. These 
presentations provided the Committee with both invaluable insight into the investment strategies 
employed by our managers and the opportunity to question them directly on both strategy and 
performance.
Interest rate duration The Committee was requested to consider a change in the duration of the investment portfolio. 
During the year the investment performance had been very strong and the Chief Investment 
Officer proposed shortening the asset duration down to around 1.25 years, thereby locking 
in some of the outperformance by de-risking the investment portfolio, should interest rates 
rise unexpectedly over the remainder of 2014. These changes, which included a change to 
the ALM guidelines as set out in the Investment Policy, were approved by the Committee and 
subsequently the Board. 92     Brit PLC  Annual Report 2014
DEAR SHAREHOLDER
On behalf of the Remuneration Committee, it gives me great 
pleasure to present our first Directors’ Remuneration Report 
following Brit’s return to the listed market. 
In accordance with the UK disclosure regime, this report 
comprises our Remuneration Policy and Annual Report on 
Remuneration. The remuneration policy sets out our forward 
looking policy on pay for directors, and will be put forward to 
shareholders for a binding vote at the 2015 annual general 
meeting. The Annual Report on Remuneration details 
payments made to directors during the last year, and how 
we will apply our policy in 2015. Shareholders will have the 
opportunity of an advisory vote on this report at the annual 
general meeting.
Details of the remuneration structure were set out in our 
prospectus prior to admission to the London Stock Exchange. 
The structure implemented was intended to be aligned 
with evolving market and best practice. During the year the 
Committee has given further consideration to how these 
arrangements will be operated in practice, and further details 
are set out in this Remuneration Report. 
The overall remuneration structure is weighted towards 
performance-related variable pay especially at the Company’s 
senior management levels. The objectives are closely aligned 
with our strategic financial priorities and reward for creation 
of shareholder value. A large proportion of variable pay 
is delivered in shares. Consistent principles apply to the 
remuneration structure for all senior executives. We have also 
rolled out operation of a global all-employee Share Incentive 
Plan to facilitate a culture of share ownership across the entire 
organisation. 
Remuneration outcomes in respect of 2014
This has been a landmark year for Brit. As well as returning to 
the listed market, we have continued the process of strategic 
transformation undertaken over the last four years and 
delivered another strong set of results. 
In 2014, the Company achieved profit after tax of £139.0m 
and a return on adjusted net tangible assets excluding FX and 
IPO costs (RoNTA) of 20.7%. This is a very strong result, and 
towards the top-end of the stretching targets set for the year. 
The Committee considered this performance in the context 
of both challenging market dynamics and the successful 
admission. The Chief Executive Officer’s bonus is 200% of 
salary and the Committee are of the view that this fairly reflects 
performance relative to our peers in what has been a very 
strong year. 
REMUNERATION REPORT
ANNUAL STATEMENT FROM THE REMUNERATION COMMITTEE CHAIRMAN
During the year, the Committee granted its first round of 
awards under the new PSP . These awards are earned based 
on an average RoNTA, the key financial metric for the Group, 
and relative total shareholder return (TSR) performance targets 
which are measured over three years. If these stretching 
targets are achieved, shares will vest over a period of three to 
five years. 
Consistent with best practice, malus and clawback provisions 
are in place. 
Further detail on Directors’ remuneration during the year is 
provided in the Annual Report on Remuneration below. 
Remuneration in 2015
As shareholders will be aware, in light of the offer from 
Fairfax (see page 18 above), there may be changes to the 
remuneration structure for 2015, depending on if and when 
the acquisition is completed. In the event that the acquisition 
is completed, then, pursuant to the rules of the relevant share 
plan, awards may vest at this time. Further details will be set 
out in the offer document. 
The Committee has made the following decisions in relation to 
the Chief Executive Officer’s remuneration for 2015 to reflect 
the nature of his role, his continued strong performance since 
appointment and the value created for shreholders since IPO.
• Annual bonus will continue to be predominantly based on 
RoNTA performance. The maximum opportunity for 2015 
will be 300% of salary; and
• If PSP awards are granted in 2015, then the intention is that 
performance targets will continue to be based on RoNTA 
and relative TSR. 
The Committee will be carefully monitoring the Company’s 
performance against the achievement of financial and strategic 
goals, in order to ensure that our remuneration arrangements 
continue to support the long-term interests of the Company 
and its shareholders, also bearing in mind evolving regulation 
that will apply to the Company. 
We wish to be transparent and open about our remuneration 
for senior management at Brit. We hope shareholders are 
comfortable with the decisions we have made and will 
support the two resolutions relating to remuneration at the 
forthcoming annual general meeting.
I would also like to take the opportunity to thank Shareholders, 
the Board, management and employees for their support in 
what has been a busy and very successful year.

Membership and attendance 
The Chief Executive Officer and HR Director are usually invited to attend all or part of Committee meetings, but are excluded 
from any discussions of their own remuneration.  
Remuneration principles 
As part of the process of admission in April 2014, the Company implemented a framework for remuneration that would operate 
in the listed environment. Much of the content was articulated in the prospectus. This Annual Report provides further detail. 
Brit’s overarching objective is to maximise returns and deliver value for our shareholders by focusing on key fundamentals  
of the specialty insurance business:
In order to support the above strategy, the Company’s approach to remuneration is to provide overall pay packages that:
• Recognise the strong link between variable compensation and performance at Company, business unit and individual levels;
• Reward employees for delivering the Group’s business plan and key strategic goals;
• Reward superior performance through incentive compensation;
• Appropriately reflect the risk appetite incorporated into the business strategy, as well as being balanced against the Group’s 
audit and compliance obligations; and
• Align employees’ interests with the interests of shareholders and other external stakeholders.

REMUNERATION REPORT
REMUNERATION POLICY REPORT
This section sets out the Company’s Remuneration Policy (the ‘Policy’), which will be put to shareholders for approval at the 
annual general meeting on 21 April 2015. Subject to shareholder approval, the Policy will take effect from 1 January 2016. 
Future remuneration policy for executive Directors
The table below summarises each element of the Policy for executive Directors, with further details set out after the table.
Base salary
Purpose and link  
to strategy
The Group’s aim is to attract the best talent and strengthen a highly committed team to allow the 
Group to achieve its business goals. 
Operation Salaries are reviewed taking into account various internal and external factors including size and 
scope of the role, individual and business performance, and practices both at industry peers and 
across the FTSE 250 more generally. Due regard is also taken of the pay and conditions of the wider 
workforce. Salaries are normally reviewed annually.
Maximum 
opportunity
Salary increases will be based on a range of factors based on individual circumstances. There is no 
maximum opportunity. The Committee will take into account pay conditions in the Group when 
determining any increases.
Performance metrics n/a
Benefits
Purpose and link  
to strategy
To provide a standard package comparable with practice in the markets in which we operate.
Operation Benefits include (but are not limited to) private medical care, life assurance, income protection and 
employee assistance. Further benefits may also be provided where the Committee considers this 
appropriate (e.g. on relocation).
Maximum 
opportunity
The value of benefits provided will be, in the Committee’s opinion, reasonable in the context of 
relevant market practice for comparable roles, taking into account any individual circumstances  
(e.g. relocation). There is no maximum monetary value.
Performance metrics n/a
Retirement benefits
Purpose and link  
to strategy
To provide market-competitive retirement benefits.
Operation Benefits are normally provided under the Group Personal Pension Plan (GPPP). The GPPP is a 
defined contribution pension arrangement, with benefits entirely based on contributions made to 
the plan and the investment returns on those contributions. Alternatively, the Company may pay a 
cash allowance in lieu of participation in the GPPP .
Where appropriate, more bespoke arrangements may be considered (e.g. for non-UK participants). 
In such circumstances, the Committee will give appropriate consideration to relevant local market 
practices and the overall cost of the arrangement.
Maximum 
opportunity
The current Chief Executive Officer receives a cash allowance equivalent to 25% of salary per annum.
For new hires the nature and value of any retirement benefit provided will be, in the Committee’s 
opinion, reasonable in the context of market practice for comparable roles and take account of both 
the individual’s circumstances and the cost to the Company.
Performance metrics n/a Brit PLC  Annual Report 2014     95     
GOVERNANCE
Annual bonus
Purpose and link  
to strategy
To provide a short-term incentive based on financial and non-financial performance over one 
financial year. 
Operation The Group Bonus Plan is a discretionary annual bonus arrangement. Under the Group Bonus Plan, 
all awards are subject to the achievement of performance targets.
A proportion of any annual bonus earned in respect of each financial year may be deferred into 
awards over shares normally vesting after a three-year deferral period, unless the Committee 
considers an alternative deferral period is appropriate. This deferral is facilitated by the Deferred 
Share Plan (DSP). 
Dividends (or equivalents) may accrue on any DSP awards shares that vest.
Maximum 
opportunity
Maximum annual opportunity up to 300% of salary. 
Performance metrics Bonuses are subject to the achievement of Group and individual performance objectives. Where 
relevant, business unit performance may also be considered. Performance conditions are normally 
set by the Remuneration Committee at the beginning of each financial year.
The overall incentive pool is normally based on Group returns and profitability. The incentive pool 
begins to accrue once a threshold performance hurdle is delivered. There are no payments for 
performance below this level.
Individual pay-outs to Executive Directors are discretionary, taking into account various factors 
including achievement of individual performance objectives relevant to the executive Director’ s roles.
In respect of 2015, the overall incentive pool will be linked to Group return on net tangible assets.
Performance share plan
Purpose and link  
to strategy
To provide rewards linked to Company performance and shareholder value over the longer-term, 
while facilitating share ownership and aligning the interests of executive Directors and shareholders.
Operation Awards normally vest dependent on performance measured over a period of at least three years. 
The Committee reviews the metrics, targets and weightings prior to each grant to ensure they 
remain appropriate.
Dividends (or equivalents) may accrue in respect of any shares that vest.
Maximum 
opportunity
Maximum award of up to 225% of salary in respect of any financial year. 
Performance metrics Vesting is based on performance against financial/operational and shareholder return measures.  
At least 25% of an award will be based on total shareholder return.
The Committee determines targets each year to ensure that targets are stretching and represent value 
creation for shareholders, while remaining motivational for management. No more than 25% of each 
element will vest for performance at the threshold level set. There will normally be proportionate 
vesting for performance between the threshold target and performance required for full vesting.
Prior to granting awards, the Committee will review the performance conditions and may opt to 
vary the metrics and weightings to ensure targets and measures remain aligned with the corporate 
strategy. The Committee will consult as appropriate with its major shareholders regarding any 
material changes. 96     Brit PLC  Annual Report 2014
Other HMRC all-employee approved plans
Purpose and link  
to strategy
To create staff alignment with the Company and promote a sense of ownership.
Operation Executive Directors may participate in any all-employee share plans operated by the Company or  
its subsidiaries.
Executive Directors would participate on the same terms as all employees of the Group.
Brit currently operates a share incentive plan (SIP).
Maximum 
opportunity
Participation in any HMRC-approved all-employee share plan (e.g. the SIP) is limited to the 
maximum award levels permitted by the relevant legislation from time-to-time.
Performance metrics n/a
Share ownership guidelines
Operation Share ownership guidelines are operated to encourage senior executives to build and/or maintain 
a material shareholding in the Company. The relevant threshold is expected to be reached and 
maintained within five years from admission or, if later, from the date the individual became subject 
to the share ownership guidelines.
The Chief Executive Officer is required to build up and maintain a holding equivalent to 200% of his 
base salary.
Notes to the future remuneration policy table
Selection of performance measures for incentives
It is intended that the performance measures and targets for 
incentives are closely aligned with the Company’s short-term 
and long-term objectives. The intention is to provide a direct 
link between reward levels, performance and delivery of the 
Group strategy, and the shareholder experience. 
The incentive plan incorporates measures which focus on 
delivery of long-term value creation and shareholder returns. 
RoNTA is a measure of efficient profitability and is a key 
indicator of how well we execute the Group’s strategy. This is 
the primary KPI used in the business. Relative total shareholder 
return targets measure the value generated for shareholders 
and provide a direct comparison against our key sector peers.
The Committee may vary or rebalance the weighting of the 
performance metrics for future incentives, to ensure that they 
remain aligned with the Company’s strategic objectives. The 
Committee may also adjust the calculation of performance 
measures and vesting outcomes (e.g. for material acquisitions 
or disposals and events not foreseen at the time the targets 
were set) to ensure they remain a fair reflection of performance 
over the relevant period.
Malus and clawback
Malus and clawback provisions may be operated at the 
discretion of the Committee in respect of awards granted 
under the DSP and the PSP . Malus (under which awards may 
be reduced or made subject to additional conditions) may be 
applied prior to the satisfaction of the award, while clawback 
(requiring a repayment of cash or some or all of the shares 
which have been delivered) may be operated up to three 
years following satisfaction of the award. Circumstances in 
which the operation of these provisions may be considered 
include a material misstatement of the Company’s financial 
results, a material failure of risk management by any member 
of the Group or a relevant business unit, material reputational 
damage to any member of the Group or relevant business 
unit, or if the participant’s employment is terminated for gross 
misconduct.
The Committee is satisfied that the above provisions are 
suitably aligned with good market practice and provide 
appropriate safeguards against payments for failure.

Recruitment policy
Brit operates in a highly competitive and specialised sector. The Company competes for talent in both the UK and international 
markets and therefore needs to remain cognisant of remuneration practices in this wider context. While aiming to remain 
competitive when recruiting talent of an appropriate calibre, the Committee will seek to avoid paying more than is necessary.
On recruitment of a new executive Director, the Committee will initially seek to align the remuneration package with the policy 
described above. The overall limits are consistent with the Policy Table.
Executive Director service contracts and payment for loss of office
Recruitment policy 
Fixed pay Salary and benefits (including retirement benefits) will normally be determined in accordance 
with the Policy Table above. 
In certain cases, the initial salary for a new appointment may be set at a lower level, with the 
intention of increasing the salary over time as the executive Directors gain experience in the role.
An alternative fixed pay package may be necessary where an individual fulfils an executive role 
on an interim basis. Benefits may also need to be tailored based on the individual circumstances 
(e.g. relocation, housing or travel allowances may be required).
Variable pay The maximum variable remuneration that may be offered to an executive Director in respect of 
recruitment will be no more than 525% of salary (excluding any buy-out arrangements). This limit 
is consistent with the overall maximum set out in the Policy Table.
Within these limits (and where appropriate) the Committee may tailor the award (e.g. timeframe, 
form, performance criteria) based on the commercial circumstances. Shareholders will be 
informed of the terms for any such arrangements.
Buyouts Where there is a need to ‘buyout’ remuneration terms forfeited on joining the Company, the 
Committee will seek to ensure any buyout is of comparable commercial value and capped as 
appropriate. 
The quantum, form and structure of any buyout arrangement will be determined by the 
Committee taking into account the terms of the arrangement being forfeited (e.g. form 
and structure of award, timeframe, performance criteria, likelihood of vesting, etc.). Where 
appropriate the Committee may seek to deliver any buyout under one of Brit’s existing incentive 
plans. Where appropriate, the Committee will normally seek to clawback any buyouts if the 
individual departs within two years of joining.
Where an executive Director is appointed from either within the Company or following corporate 
activity/reorganisation (e.g. acquisition of another company), the normal policy will be to honour 
any legacy arrangements in line with the original terms and conditions.
Non-executive Directors On the appointment of a new Chairman or non-executive Director, the terms and fees will 
normally be consistent with the fee policy outlined later in the Policy. Fees to non-executive 
Directors will not include share options or performance-related elements.
Service contracts
General policy The Company’s policy is for executive Directors’ service contracts to normally be terminable on six 
months’ notice by either party. Where appropriate, consideration may be given to a longer notice period 
of up to 12 months. The Company may terminate an individual’s service agreement at an earlier date by 
making a payment in lieu of notice in respect of salary and benefits for the outstanding period of notice. 
Consideration will be given to appropriate mitigation terms to reduce payments in lieu of notice made 
on termination in the event of the executive Director commencing alternative employment within the 
relevant period. Benefits payable on termination may include certain one-off benefits in connection with 
termination, such as legal costs and the costs of meeting any settlement agreement.

GOVERNANCE
Incentive arrangements
Annual bonus Payment of any bonus is at the discretion of the Committee taking into account the circumstances of 
leaving and performance over the relevant period. Usual policy is not to pay any bonus. 
DSP Good leaver (e.g. cessation due to ill-health)
Any outstanding awards will ordinarily vest on the normal vesting date. The extent to which awards vest will 
be determined by the Committee based on the period that has elapsed between the grant of the award 
and cessation. The Committee can alternatively decide that awards may vest early at the time of cessation 
(or on such other date prior to the original vesting date as the Committee may determine). 
If a participant dies, his award will vest immediately (unless the Committee determines otherwise, on the 
same basis as referred to above). 
Other leavers (e.g. termination for cause) 
Any unvested awards lapse on cessation. Vested but unexercised awards may be exercised for a period  
of 12 months following cessation (or such period as the Committee may determine), except in the case  
of summary dismissal where all awards lapse.
PSP Good leaver (e.g. cessation due to ill-health)
Any outstanding awards will ordinarily vest on the normal vesting date as determined by the Committee, 
based on the extent that any applicable performance conditions measured over the original performance 
period have been satisfied and the period of time elapsed between the grant of the award and cessation. 
Alternatively, the Committee can decide that awards may vest early at the time of cessation (or on such 
other date prior to the original vesting date as the Committee may determine) but with any vesting subject 
to performance measured up to cessation and time prorating (on the basis referred to above).
If a participant dies, his award will vest immediately (unless the committee decides otherwise) with any 
vesting subject to performance and prorating for time on the same basis as referred to above.
Other leavers (e.g. termination for cause) 
Any unvested awards lapse on cessation. Vested but unexercised awards may be exercised for a period  
of 12 months following cessation (or such period as the Committee may determine), except in the case  
of summary dismissal where all awards lapse.
The service contract of the Chief Executive Officer, Mark Cloutier, is terminable on six months’ notice by either party. During 
the notice period the individual may be placed on garden leave. During this period he remains an employee of the Group and 
is subject to certain restrictions. The Company may elect to terminate Mark Cloutier’s employment immediately by making a 
payment in lieu of notice equivalent to his basic salary for the notice period. This would typically be paid in monthly instalments, 
which continue until the expiry of the notice period or the date on which the individual obtains alternative employment. 
The service agreement also contains post-termination restrictions. For a period of six months after termination (less any period 
spent on garden leave), he may not be concerned (in a similar role) in any competing business without the Board’s written 
concent. For a period of 12 months after termination (less any period spent on garden leave) he may not solicit or employ any 
senior employees from the Company in connection with any competing business.
Incentive plans
The Committee retains discretion to determine the exact termination terms of any executive Director, having regard to all the 
relevant facts and circumstances available to them at the time, subject to the terms of the relevant incentive plan rules. The table 
below sets out the general position and range of approaches in respect of incentive arrangements.  100     Brit PLC  Annual Report 2014
Future remuneration policy table for non-executive Directors
Remuneration of independent non-executive Directors, with the exception of the Chairman, is determined by the Chairman 
and the executive Directors. The remuneration of the Chairman is determined by the Committee. Directors are not involved in 
any decisions as to their own remuneration. The current non-independent non-executive Directors are not entitled to any fee in 
respect of their appointments.
The table below sets out the policy with respect to non-executive Directors. Non-executive Directors do not participate in the 
Company’s bonus arrangements, share incentive plans or pension-benefit plans. Any new independent non-executive Director 
will be treated in accordance with the policy.
The appointment of the Chairman and each independent non-executive Director is terminable by either party, giving not less 
than three months’ written notice. 
The appointment of any non-independent non-executive Director will terminate on the individual resigning from his or her office 
with the Company and on termination of the applicable relationship deed. 
Detailed provisions
All incentive awards are subject to the terms of the relevant plan rules under which the award was granted. The Committee may 
adjust or amend awards only in accordance with the provisions of the plan rules. This includes making adjustments to awards to 
reflect corporate events, such as a change in the Company’s capital structure. In accordance with the plan rules, awards may be 
settled in cash.
The Committee may amend any performance condition applicable to incentive awards in certain circumstances (e.g. significant 
acquisition or disposal) if the Committee considers it appropriate and the amended performance condition would be fair, 
reasonable and not materially less challenging than the original performance condition would have been in the absence of such 
circumstances. 
If the Company undergoes a change of control, then awards will vest to the extent determined by the Committee based on 
the period of time elapsed between the date on which the award was granted and the change of control and, in the case of 
PSP awards, the extent to which any relevant performance conditions have been satisfied after taking into account all factors 
it considers relevant (including its assessment of likely future performance). The Committee (with the consent of the acquiring 
company) may allow or require awards to be exchanged for equivalent new awards in the acquiring company in the event of an 
internal reorganisation of the Group or if the participant agrees to the exchange. 
The Committee may make any remuneration payments (including vesting of incentives) and payments for loss of office 
notwithstanding that they are not in line with the policy set out above, where the terms of that payment were agreed before this 
Policy came into effect; or at a time when the relevant individual was not a Director of the Company and, in the opinion of the 
Committee, the payment was not in consideration for the individual becoming a Director of the Company. 
Fees
Approach to setting 
remuneration
Fees are set at appropriate levels to ensure non-executive Directors are paid to reflect the 
individual responsibility taken. Fees are reviewed periodically. 
When setting fee levels, consideration is given to a number of internal and external factors 
including responsibilities, market positioning, inflation and colleague pay increases. 
Where appropriate, benefits appropriate to the role may be provided. Travel and other 
reasonable expenses (including fees incurred in obtaining professional advice in the furtherance 
of their duties and any associated taxes) incurred in the course of performing their duties may 
be paid by the Company or reimbursed to independent and non-independent non-executive 
Directors.
Opportunity The total fees paid to non-executive Directors will remain within the limit stated in the Articles  
of Association.
Individual fees reflect responsibility and time commitment. Additional fees are paid for further 
responsibilities, such as chairmanship of committees, or duties related to subsidiary boards.
Benefits provided will be reasonable, in the Committee’s opinion, in the market context and take 
account of the individual circumstances and benefits provided to comparable roles.
REMUNERATION POLICY REPORT Brit PLC  Annual Report 2014     101     
GOVERNANCE
The Committee may make minor amendments to the remuneration policy to aid its operation or implementation without 
seeking shareholder approvals (e.g. for regulatory, exchange control, tax or administrative purposes). 
Consideration of employment conditions elsewhere at Brit
Remuneration across the Company is based on similar principles. When considering remuneration arrangements for senior 
executives the Committee takes into account pay and conditions across the Group. 
Incentive plans are operated across the Group to ensure remuneration is linked to performance. Incentive opportunities are 
based on the nature and seniority of the relevant role. Annual bonus plans are operated across the Group, with arrangements 
tailored to the nature of the role where appropriate. Participation in DSP and PSP is generally limited to senior management, 
usually on similar terms to the Chief Executive Officer.
All employees (including the Chief Executive Officer) participate in the same retirement and benefits schemes, albeit the Chief 
Executive Officer has a cash allowance in lieu of participation in the GPPP . Brit also operates an all-employee share incentive 
plan to create staff alignment and promote a sense of ownership in the Company.
The Committee does not formally consult with colleagues on the setting of the Policy but as a result of the Company’s all-
employee share plans, colleagues are able to become shareholders in the Company and can comment on the Policy in the same 
way as other shareholders.
Consideration of shareholder views
The Committee recognises the importance of engaging with key shareholders regarding the Company’s approach to pay for 
executive Directors. An overview of remuneration arrangements for senior executives was disclosed in the admission prospectus. 102     Brit PLC  Annual Report 2014

ANNUAL REPORT ON REMUNERATION
This Annual Report on Remuneration explains how Directors have been paid in relation to the year ended 31 December 2014 
and provides detailed disclosure on how the Remuneration Policy will be implemented in 2015.
This report will be put to an advisory shareholder vote at the 2015 annual general meeting held on 21 April 2015. Where 
information has been subject to audit this has been stated.
Brit’s shares were admitted onto the London Stock Exchange on 2 April 2014 (‘admission’). As such, there are a number of 
disclosures for which we are only required to report ‘part-year’ numbers. However, in the spirit of transparency embodied in the 
new directors’ remuneration disclosure regulations we have reported full-year figures wherever possible or appropriate to do so.
Single total figure of remuneration for the Chief Executive Officer (audited)
The table below sets out the remuneration received by the Chief Executive Officer for the financial years ending 31 December 
2014 and 31 December 2013.
Notes to the Chief Executive Officer Remuneration table
Salary
The CEO’s salary in 2014 was £450,000. 
The Committee is mindful that the Chief Executive Officer’s salary has not been increased since April 2012. Given the 
exceptional circumstances, the Committee has not made a decision in respect of the Chief Executive Officer’s salary for 2015. 
Any increase would look to take into account the nature of his role and contribution, as well as practise amongst comparable 
companies. Details of any salary review undertaken in due course will be disclosed in subsequent reports as appropriate. 
Benefits
Benefits provided included private health cover, permanent health cover and life assurance cover in 2014. As disclosed in the 
prospectus, prior to admission, a loan was made by Achilles Holdings 1, S.à.r.l.  to the Chief Executive Officer. The taxable 
benefit associated with this loan was £8,584. This loan has now been repaid in full. 
Pension
The Chief Executive Officer received a pension allowance of 25% of salary (inclusive of employer national insurance 
contributions) in lieu of contributions under the Brit Group Personal Pension Plan. He received no other retirement benefits from 
the Group.
Annual bonus
The annual bonus plan is designed to reward and incentivise performance over the financial year. The bonus framework 
uses a range of performance measures, linked to Group, business unit (where relevant) and individual performance. Prior to 
determining the final bonus outcomes, the Committee considers performance in the round to ensure that actual bonuses are 
appropriate.
The maximum bonus for the Chief Executive Officer in 2014 was 200% of base salary, as disclosed in the prospectus. The 
whole of his 2014 annual bonus was dependent on performance against Group profit targets and assessment of individual 
performance. 
The table below sets out the committee’s assessment of performance achieved in respect of the 2014 annual bonus. The 
Remuneration Committee and the Board have given careful consideration to the retrospective disclosure of targets and 
has disclosed targets where not considered to be commercially sensitive. Where details of any performance conditions are 
considered to be commercially sensitive disclosure will be considered in future remuneration reports where appropriate.

The Company’s RoNTA performance creates a bonus pool. An individual’s performance then determines the value of the bonus 
payable to him. For 2014, the target RoNTA was 18.0% with a range created around this level. Actual RoNTA achieved was 20.7%.
When considering the Chief Executive’s bonus, the Committee noted his role and contribution played in the successful return 
to the listed market; growth in premiums and strong underwriting performance notwithstanding challenging market conditions 
and ongoing progress in developing platforms in line with our long-term strategy. The RoNTA outcomes represents a third year 
of sector leading returns. On the basis of these factors and taking into account overall performance, the Committee determined 
that the bonus for the Chief Executive Officer would be 200% of base salary. 
For 2015, the maximum bonus opportunity for the Chief Executive Officer will be 300% of base salary which is aligned with 
sector practice. The Committee has agreed the performance measures and targets against which any annual bonus will be 
assessed. The targets have not been disclosed prospectively as the Board considers this commercially sensitive information.  
The 2015 bonus will have a broadly similar structure to the award in 2014. 
Long-term incentives
During 2014 the Company granted the first set of PSP awards. The key terms of the award granted during 2014 are as follows:
• Award subject to TSR and RoNTA targets
• Three-year performance period
• Awards vest in tranches over three to five years following grant.
The performance targets for the 2014 award are as follows:
1 The constituents of this group are: Ace, Amlin, Arch, Argo, Aspen, Axis, Beazley, Catlin, Endurance, HCC Insurance, Hiscox, Lancashire Holdings, Markel, Novae 
Group, QBE Insurance, Validus, W R Berkley, XL Group. Total shareholder return performance will be measured from the date of admission on 2 April 2014.
2 The level of vesting for performance between threshold and superior performance will be determined on a straight-line basis. For performance below threshold 
for either element of the award, vesting will be nil for that element.
Vesting of each element of the award will take place in three tranches.  Subject to performance, the first tranche (50% of the 
total award) will normally vest and become exercisable on the third anniversary of grant. The remaining tranches of the award 
will vest on the fourth (25% of total award) and fifth anniversaries (25% of total award) of grant. 104     Brit PLC  Annual Report 2014
In respect of 2014, the Chief Executive Officer was granted an award equivalent to 120% of salary. The table below sets out 
further details of the award.

Under the rules of the PSP , the award will be subject to malus and clawback provisions, as summarised in the Policy Report. 
If awards are granted in 2015 (in the context of the offer from Fairfax to acquire the Company), then details will be disclosed,  
as appropriate, in our 2015 annual report on remuneration.
All-employee share plan

to reward them on the occasion of the admission. Following admission, awards were made on similar terms under the

holders of three-quarters in nominal value of the issued shares of the class or with the sanction of a special resolution passed at  
a separate general meeting of the shareholders.

arrangements.
The CVC-affiliated funds and the Apollo entities agreed that, subject to certain exceptions, during the period of 180 days from  
2 April 2014, the date of admission of the Company’s ordinary shares to the Official List, they would not directly or indirectly 
effect the disposal of, or interest in, any ordinary shares of the Company. The lock up arrangements in respect of the CVC-
affiliated funds and the Apollo entities are no longer applicable.
Each of the Directors and certain of the management employees who held shares at the time of the IPO agreed that, subject to 
certain exceptions, during the period of 365 days from the 2 April 2014, the date of admission of the Company’s ordinary shares

Power of Directors to issue shares
The Directors require express authorisation from shareholders to allot new shares. This authority can be granted for a period of 
five years, however, we will follow best practice and seek shareholder approval annually. It will be proposed at the 2015 AGM 
that the Directors be granted authority to allot new shares.

Directors’ responsibility statement
The Directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report and the Financial Statements in accordance with applicable law 
and regulations.
Company law requires the Directors to prepare Financial Statements for each financial year. Under that law the Directors have 
prepared the Group Financial Statements in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by 
the European Union. 
Under company law the Directors must not approve the Financial Statements unless they are satisfied that they give a true and 
fair view of the state of affairs of the Group and the Company and of the profit or loss of the Group for that period. In preparing 
these Financial Statements, the Directors are required to:
• Select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently;
• Make judgements and accounting estimates that are reasonable and prudent;
• State whether applicable IFRSs as adopted by the European Union have been followed, subject to any material departures 
disclosed and explained in the Financial Statements; and
• Prepare the Financial Statements on the going concern basis unless it is inappropriate to presume that the Company will 
continue in business. 112     Brit PLC  Annual Report 2014
The Directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting records that are sufficient to show and explain the Company’s 
transactions and disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position of the Company and the Group and enable 
them to ensure that the Financial Statements and the Directors’ Remuneration Report comply with the Companies Act 2006 and, 
as regards the Group Financial Statements, Article 4 of the IAS Regulation. They are also responsible for safeguarding the assets 
of the Company and the Group and hence for taking reasonable steps for the prevention and detection of fraud and other 
irregularities.
Having taken advice from the Audit Committee on the process, all the Directors consider that the Annual Report, taken as a 
whole, is fair, balanced and understandable and provides the information necessary for shareholders to assess the Company’s 
performance, business model and strategy.
Pursuant to the Disclosure and Transparency Rule 4, the Directors confirm that, to the best of their knowledge:
• The Consolidated Financial Statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally 
accepted in the United Kingdom, give a true and fair view of the assets, liabilities, financial position, and profit or loss of the 
Group; and 
• The Strategic Report includes a fair review of the development and performance of the business and the position of the 
Group, together with a description of the principal risks and uncertainties that it faces. 
Going concern 
A review of the financial performance of the Group is set out on pages 48 to 59. The financial position of the Group, its cash 
flows and borrowing facilities are set out on pages 40 to 47. After reviewing the Group’s budgets and medium term plans, the 
Directors have a reasonable expectation that the Group has adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the 
foreseeable future. For this reason they continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the accounts.
Political donations
Neither the Company nor any of its subsidiaries made any political donations during the year.
Disclosure of information to the Company’s auditor
In accordance with the provisions of section 418 of the Companies Act 2006, each of the persons who are Directors of the 
Company at the date of approval of this report confirms that:
• So far as the Director is aware, there is no relevant audit information (as defined in the Companies Act 2006) of which the 
Company’s auditor is unaware; and
• The Director has taken all the steps that he ought to have taken as a Director to make himself aware of any relevant audit 
information (as defined) and to establish that the Company’s auditor is aware of that information.
Auditor
Ernst & Young LLP (EY), the auditor of the Company, has expressed willingness to continue in office. A resolution to reappoint 
them as the Company’s auditor and to authorise the Directors to determine EY’s remuneration will be proposed at the 
forthcoming AGM.
The Audit Committee has made the decision to commence a qualifying audit tender process in 2015 for the appointment of the 
Group auditor for 2016.
Annual general meeting
The venue and timing of the Company’s 2015 annual general meeting is detailed in the notice convening the meeting which will 
be available for download from the Company’s corporate website at: www.britinsurance.com/ir.
Offer from Fairfax 
On 17 February 2015, the boards of Fairfax Financial Holdings Limited (Fairfax) and the Company announced that they had 
reached agreement regarding the terms of a recommended cash offer through which the entire issued and to be issued ordinary 
share capital of the Company would be acquired by FFHL Group Ltd, an entity wholly-owned by Fairfax. 
Under the terms of this offer, shareholders of the Company would be entitled to receive 305 pence in cash for each Brit Share,

Opinion on Financial Statements
In our opinion:
• The Financial Statements give a true and fair view of the 
state of the Group’s and of the parent Company’s affairs as 
at 31 December 2014 and of the Group’s profit for the year 
then ended;
• The Group Financial Statements have been properly 
prepared in accordance with International Financial 
Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the European 
Union;
• The parent Company Financial Statements have been 
properly prepared in accordance with United Kingdom 
Generally Accepted Accounting Practice; and
• The Financial Statements have been prepared in 
accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 
2006 and, as regards the Group Financial Statements, 
Article 4 of the IAS Regulation.
What we have audited
We have audited the Group and parent Company Financial 
Statements of Brit PLC for the year ended 31 December 2014 
which comprise:
• the consolidated income statement;
• the consolidated statement of comprehensive income;
• the consolidated statement of financial position;
• the consolidated statement of cash flows;
• the consolidated statement of changes in equity;
• the related notes 1 to 43 to the Consolidated Financial 
Statements;
• the parent Company statement of financial position;
• the parent Company statement of cash flows (for the 
period from 19 December 2013 to 31 December 2014);
• the parent Company statement of changes in 
equity (for the period from 19 December 2013 to 
31 December 2014); and
• the related notes 1 to 14 to the parent Company Financial 
Statements.
The financial reporting framework that has been applied 
in the preparation of the Group Financial Statements 
is applicable law and International Financial Reporting 
Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the European Union.
The financial reporting framework that has been applied in 
the preparation of the parent Company Financial Statements 
is applicable law and United Kingdom Accounting Standards 
(United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice).
This report is made solely to the Company’s members, 
as a body, in accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the 
Companies Act 2006. Our audit work has been undertaken so 
that we might state to the Company’s members those matters 
we are required to state to them in an auditor’s report and 
for no other purpose. To the fullest extent permitted by law, 
we do not accept or assume responsibility to anyone other 
than the Company and the Company’s members as a body, 
for our audit work, for this report, or for the opinions we have 
formed.
Our assessment of the risks of material 
misstatement and responses to those risks
We identified the following risks that have had the greatest 
effect on the overall audit strategy, the allocation of resources 
in the audit, and directing the efforts of the engagement 
team together with our audit responses to those risks:
• Valuation of insurance liabilities
• Valuation of investments
• Revenue recognition   Brit PLC Annual Report 2014 117
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Valuation of insurance liabilities
Refer to page 82 (Audit Committee report), page 134 (accounting policy), page 141 (critical accounting estimates) 
and page 178 (disclosures)
Risk Response
The valuation of the insurance liabilities, or claims reserves, 
held by the Group is an area of risk due to the level of 
subjectivity in estimating the ultimate cost of the settlement 
of claims that have occurred but for which the eventual 
outcome remains uncertain.
In particular, judgement is required when estimating the value 
of amounts that should be provided for claims that have been 
incurred at the reporting date but have not yet been reported 
to the Group.
In determining the claims reserves, management include an 
additional margin above the actuarial best estimate to take 
account of estimation uncertainty.
The key risk is the use of inappropriate assumptions resulting 
in reported claims reserves not falling within a reasonable 
range of possible estimates, meaning insurance liabilities 
could be materially misstated.
These judgements and uncertainties are significant to the 
earnings of the Group.
We understood, assessed and tested the design and 
operational effectiveness of key controls over the Brit PLC 
reserving process, which included controls over the extraction 
of data from the underlying systems and the review and 
approval of the reserves.
We used our own actuarial specialists to support us in our 
evaluation of management’s methodology against market 
practice, and challenged management’s assumptions and 
their assessment of major sensitivities based on our market 
knowledge and industry data where available.
Using management data we re-projected the claims reserves 
on both a gross and net basis and investigated further where 
there were significant differences between our projections 
and management’s reported claims reserves.
Using our re-projections we then evaluated whether the 
reported claims reserves at the year-end fall within an 
acceptable range, and also compared for consistency 
with the position in the range in prior years. This included 
consideration of the consistency of the basis for the margin 
applied to the actuarial best estimate.
In light of our work outlined above we also considered the 
adequacy of disclosures of the judgements and uncertainties 
being made by the directors in the insurance risk note 
starting on page 143, and Note 21 related to insurance and 
reinsurance contracts. 118 Brit PLC Annual Report 2014
INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORT TO THE MEMBERS OF BRIT PLC
Valuation of investments
Refer to page 82 (Audit Committee report), page 135 (accounting policy), page 142 (critical accounting estimates) 
and page 186 (disclosures)
Risk Response
The Group’s financial investments represent 59% of total 
assets.
The investment strategy adopted by management includes 
holdings in instruments such as structured products, loan 
portfolios and investment funds.
These investments are not always valued using quoted 
prices based on observable market information. As a result 
significant judgement is inherent in the methodologies 
and assumptions used by management in determining the 
fair value of these investments and preparing the required 
disclosures in the notes to the Financial Statements.
We understood, assessed and tested the design and 
operating effectiveness of the key controls over the 
investment valuation process, including management’s 
process for estimating the fair value of investments held 
and controls over information provided by the investment 
managers.
We used our valuation experts to support the audit team in 
challenging the valuation methodologies and assumptions 
being used by management to price these investments. 
Where model inputs and assumptions were not observable 
in the market, our valuation experts have critically assessed 
whether these management valuations fell within an 
acceptable range based on relevant knowledge and 
experience of the market.
We also considered the investments disclosures for 
compliance with IFRS, with particular focus on the fair 
value hierarchy and related disclosures for Level 2 and 3 
investments.   Brit PLC Annual Report 2014 119
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Revenue Recognition
Refer to page 82 (Audit Committee report), page 133 (accounting policy), page 142 (critical accounting estimates) 
and page 178 (disclosures)
Risk Response
For certain contracts written, premium is initially recognised 
based on estimates of ultimate premiums. Estimation occurs 
for contracts where pricing is based on variables which are 
not known with certainty at the point of binding the contract 
or where contracts have been entered into but not processed 
on the system by 31 December 2014.
These estimates are judgemental and therefore could result 
in misstatements of revenue recognised in the Financial 
Statements.
There is also a risk that earnings patterns applied to written 
premiums are inappropriate or inaccurate and that insufficient 
risk transfer is present within policies to categorise as 
insurance contracts.
We evaluated and tested the key controls over the premium 
process, which included the data reconciliations over the flow 
of premium balances from initiation on underlying systems 
through to the general ledger.
We used actuarial specialists to support the audit team 
in performing a consistency check of premium income 
estimates to identify over or under estimation, which was 
supplemented by detailed tests of certain transactions and 
balances relating to premiums.
We have recalculated a sample of earning patterns and 
considered by class of business whether earning patterns 
are consistent with the prior year, our expectations and our 
understanding of the business. We have also completed 
analytical review procedures on premium balances.
We reviewed a sample of policies to ensure appropriate 
transfer of risk has taken place and premium has been 
recognised in accordance with the Company’s policy and 
applicable accounting framework.
The Audit Committee’s consideration of these judgements is set out on page 82.
Our application of materiality
We apply the concept of materiality both in planning 
and performing our audit, and in evaluating the effect of 
identified misstatements on our audit and of uncorrected 
misstatements, if any, on the Financial Statements and in 
forming our opinion in the Audit Report. When establishing 
our overall audit strategy, we determined a magnitude of 
uncorrected misstatements that we judged would be material 
for the Financial Statements as a whole.
We determined planning materiality for the Group to be 
£5.3m, which was based on 5% of prior year profit on ordinary 
activities before tax taking into account current year forecasts. 
This provided a basis for determining the nature, timing 
and extent of risk assessment procedures, identifying and 
assessing the risk of material misstatement and determining 
the nature, timing and extent of further audit procedures.
On the basis of our risk assessments, together with our 
assessment of the Group’s overall control environment,  
our judgement is that overall performance materiality  
(i.e. our tolerance for misstatement in an individual account  
or balance) for the Group should be 50% of materiality, 
namely £2.7m. Our objective in adopting this approach 
was to ensure that total uncorrected and undetected audit 
differences in all accounts did not exceed our materiality 
level.
At year end we have revised our materiality based on 5% 
of actual profit on ordinary activities before tax of £149.1m 
(2013: PBT of £107.4m) to £7.5m (2013 final: £5.3m). As a 
result we have also revised our performance materiality to 
£3.8m (2013 final: £2.7m).
We agreed with the Audit Committee that we would report 
to the Committee all audit differences in excess of £0.3m, 
as well as differences below that threshold that, in our view, 
warranted reporting on qualitative grounds.
We evaluate any uncorrected misstatements against both the 
quantitative measures of materiality discussed above and in 
the light of other relevant qualitative considerations. 120 Brit PLC Annual Report 2014
INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORT TO THE MEMBERS OF BRIT PLC
An overview of the scope of our audit
Following our assessment of the risk of material misstatement 
to the Group Financial Statements, we performed the audit in 
order to obtain assurance that the Financial Statements give 
a true and fair view and cover the risks identified above. The 
work performed enabled us to provide an audit opinion on 
the Group Financial Statements as a whole.
Whilst the Group has operations in locations other than 
the United Kingdom, we have performed an assessment of 
these other Group locations and do not consider them to be 
significant enough to warrant an audit by a local audit team 
for group reporting purposes. In completing our procedures, 
we have therefore audited all material overseas balances. The 
audit work performed by the team covered 100% of each of 
the Group’s insurance liabilities, investments and revenue.
Respective responsibilities of directors and auditor
As explained more fully in the Directors’ Responsibilities 
Statement set out on page 111 the directors are responsible 
for the preparation of the Financial Statements and for being 
satisfied that they give a true and fair view. Our responsibility 
is to audit and express an opinion on the Financial Statements 
in accordance with applicable law and International Standards 
on Auditing (UK and Ireland). Those standards require us to 
comply with the Auditing Practices Board’s Ethical Standards 
for Auditors.
Scope of the audit of the Financial Statements
An audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts 
and disclosures in the Financial Statements sufficient to give 
reasonable assurance that the Financial Statements are free 
from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or 
error. This includes an assessment of: whether the accounting 
policies are appropriate to the Group’s and the parent 
Company’s circumstances and have been consistently applied 
and adequately disclosed; the reasonableness of significant 
accounting estimates made by the directors; and the overall 
presentation of the Financial Statements.
In addition, we read all the financial and non-financial 
information in the Annual Report to identify material 
inconsistencies with the audited Financial Statements and to 
identify any information that is apparently materially incorrect 
based on, or materially inconsistent with, the knowledge 
acquired by us in the course of performing the audit. If we 
become aware of any apparent material misstatements or 
inconsistencies we consider the implications for our report.
Opinion on other matters prescribed by the 
Companies Act 2006
In our opinion:
• the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be 
audited has been properly prepared in accordance with 
the Companies Act 2006; and
• the information given in the Strategic Report and the 
Directors’ Report for the financial year for which the 
Financial Statements are prepared is consistent with the 
Financial Statements.
Matters on which we are required to report by 
exception
We have nothing to report in respect of the following:
Under the ISAs (UK and Ireland), we are required to report to 
you if, in our opinion, information in the annual report is:
• materially inconsistent with the information in the audited 
Financial Statements; or
• apparently materially incorrect based on, or materially 
inconsistent with, our knowledge of the Group acquired in 
the course of performing our audit; or
• is otherwise misleading.
In particular, we are required to consider whether we have 
identified any inconsistencies between our knowledge 
acquired during the audit and the directors’ statement 
that they consider the annual report is fair, balanced and 
understandable and whether the annual report appropriately 
discloses those matters that we communicated to the audit 
committee which we consider should have been disclosed.   Brit PLC Annual Report 2014 121
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Under the Companies Act 2006 we are required to report to 
you if, in our opinion:
• adequate accounting records have not been kept by the 
parent Company, or returns adequate for our audit have 
not been received from branches not visited by us; or
• the parent Company Financial Statements and the part of 
the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited are not 
in agreement with the accounting records and returns; or
• certain disclosures of directors’ remuneration specified by 
law are not made; or
• we have not received all the information and explanations 
we require for our audit.
Under the Listing Rules we are required to review:
• the Directors’ statement, set out on page 112, in relation 
to going concern; and
• the part of the Corporate Governance Statement relating 
to the Company’s compliance with the nine provisions 
of the UK Corporate Governance Code specified for our 
review.

Notes:
1.  The maintenance and integrity of the Brit PLC web site 
is the responsibility of the directors; the work carried 
out by the auditors does not involve consideration of 
these matters and, accordingly, the auditors accept no 
responsibility for any changes that may have occurred to 
the Financial Statements since they were initially presented 
on the web site.
2.  Legislation in the United Kingdom governing the 
preparation and dissemination of Financial Statements may 
differ from legislation in other jurisdictions. CONTENTS

INTRODUCTION TO THE PRIMARY STATEMENTS
Consolidated income statement
The consolidated income statement shows income earned and expenses incurred by all the companies of Brit. Other items are 
shown in the statement of comprehensive income. The numbers in brackets are costs or losses incurred. The earnings per share 
is the profit for the year divided by the number of shares.
Consolidated statement of comprehensive income
As well as the profit or loss reported in the consolidated income statement, there are a number of other items not reported in 
the consolidated income statement which are instead shown here. These are gains and losses in the Group’s pension scheme 
and any tax associated with these gains or losses. The statement starts from profit or loss reported in the income statement and 
adjusts for any gains and losses arising as a result of the pension scheme to show the overall result. 
Consolidated statement of financial position
The consolidated statement of financial position is a summary of assets and how the assets have been funded through liabilities 
and equity investment by shareholders. 
Consolidated statement of cash flows
The consolidated statement of cash flows shows how we generate cash through our operating activities, how we have spent 
cash (investing activities) and how we have borrowed or spent cash to fund our business for all the companies in the Group.
Consolidated statement of changes in equity
The consolidated statement of changes in equity shows how the various lines in the equity section of the Group’s statement of 
financial position have moved during the year. The main changes are due to corporate reorganisation and listing of the Group 
on the London Stock Exchange along with profit for the year shown in the ‘Total comprehensive income recognised’ line.  CONTENTS

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED 
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
The first three Notes provide details of the corporate reorganisation, basis of preparation and accounting policies applied in 
producing these Financial Statements and the critical accounting estimates and judgements therein.
1 GENERAL INFORMATION
The Consolidated Financial Statements of Brit PLC and its subsidiaries (collectively, the Group) for the year ended 
31 December 2014 were authorised for issue in accordance with a resolution of the Directors on 24 February 2015.
Brit PLC (the Company) is a limited company, incorporated and domiciled in England and Wales, whose shares are publicly 
traded. The Group’s principal activity is the underwriting of general insurance and reinsurance business.
2 ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND BASIS OF PREPARATION
2.1 Corporate reorganisation
Brit PLC was incorporated as a limited company on 19 December 2013 and was subsequently re-registered as a public limited 
company on 24 March 2014.
On 28 March 2014, Brit PLC acquired the entire share capital of the former ultimate holding company of the Group, Achilles 
Holdings 1 S.à.r.l. Brit PLC was introduced as a new parent to the Achilles Insurance Group by the principal investors who were 
the same before and after the reorganisation.
Brit PLC’s ordinary shares were admitted to trading on the London Stock Exchange on 2 April 2014.
On the basis that the transaction was effected by creating a new parent that is itself not a business, the transaction is considered 
to be outside the scope of IFRS 3 Business Combinations. It has therefore been accounted for using the pooling of interest 
method as a continuation of the existing Group. The result is that the Consolidated Financial Statements of Brit PLC are the 
same as those previously presented by Achilles Holdings 1 S.à.r.l., except for the share capital being that of Brit PLC.
2.2 Basis of preparation
The Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended 31 December 2014 have been prepared in accordance with 
International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as adopted by the European Union (EU).
The Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared on a historical cost basis, except for financial investments and 
derivative contracts which have been measured at fair value. The Consolidated Financial Statements are presented in Sterling 
and all values are rounded to the nearest £0.1m except where otherwise indicated.
Certain amounts recorded in the financial information include estimates and assumptions made by management, particularly 
about insurance liability reserves, investment valuations, interest rates and other factors. Actual results may differ from the 
estimates made.
The Consolidated Financial Statements include the results of the Company and all its subsidiary undertakings (collectively, the 
Group) made up to the same accounting date. NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
132 Brit PLC Annual Report 2014
2 ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND BASIS OF PREPARATION (continued)
The Group has adopted the following new standards and amendments to standards with a date of initial application of 
1 January 2014:
(a) Offsetting Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities – Amendments to IAS 32
These amendments clarify the meaning of ‘currently has a legally enforceable right to set-off’ and also clarify the criteria for 
non-simultaneous settlement mechanisms of clearing houses to qualify for offsetting. These amendments have no impact  
on the Group.
(b) Recoverable Amount Disclosures for Non‑Financial Assets – Amendments to IAS 36
These amendments remove the unintended consequences of IFRS 13 ‘Fair Value Measurement’ on the disclosures required 
under IAS 36 ‘Impairment of Assets’. In addition, these amendments require disclosure of the recoverable amounts for the 
assets or cash-generating units (CGUs) for which an impairment loss has been recognised or reversed during the period. 
These amendments have no impact on the Group.
(c) Novation of Derivatives and Continuation of Hedge Accounting – Amendments to IAS 39
These amendments provide relief from discontinuing hedge accounting when novation of a derivative designated as a hedging 
instrument meets certain criteria. These amendments have no impact on the Group.
(d) IFRIC 21 – Levies
IFRIC 21 was endorsed by the EU for periods commencing on or after 17 June 2014. Earlier application was permitted and 
hence the Group has early adopted the IFRIC in accordance with the IASB effective date of 1 January 2014. It is applicable 
to all levies imposed by governments under legislation, other than outflows that are within the scope of other standards. The 
interpretation clarifies that an entity recognises a liability for a levy no earlier than when the activity that triggers payment, as 
identified by the relevant legislation, occurs. It also clarifies that a levy liability is accrued progressively only if the activity that 
triggers payment occurs over a period of time, in accordance with the relevant legislation. IFRIC 21 has no impact on the Group.
At the date of authorisation of these Financial Statements, the following standards which have not been applied in these 
Financial Statements were in issue but not yet effective:
Standard  Effective
IFRS 14 Regulatory Deferral Accounts (2014) Periods commencing on or after 1 January 2016
IFRS 15 Revenue From Contracts With Customers (2014) Periods commencing on or after 1 January 2017
IFRS 9 Financial Instruments (2013) Periods commencing on or after 1 January 2018
In November 2009, as part of the phased project to replace IAS 39 ‘Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement’, the 
IASB issued IFRS 9 ‘Financial Instruments’ which reconsiders the classification and measurement of financial assets. This standard 
has not yet been endorsed by the EU. The Group plans to assess the impact of this standard on its Financial Statements in 
conjunction with the revised standard on IFRS 4 ‘Insurance Contracts’ which is expected to be effective from no earlier than 
2018. The Directors anticipate that the adoption of the other standards in future periods will have no material impact on the 
Financial Statements of the Group.   Brit PLC Annual Report 2014 133
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
2.3 Basis of consolidation
The consolidated accounts include the accounts of the Company, its subsidiaries and the Group’s participation in Lloyd’s 
syndicates’ assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses. Subsidiaries are those entities (including structured entities) that an investor  
controls, when it is exposed, or has rights, to variable returns from its involvement with the investee and has the ability 
to affect those returns through its power over the investee. The Financial Statements of subsidiaries are prepared up to 
31 December each year. Consolidation adjustments are made to convert subsidiary accounts from local GAAP into IFRS so as to 
remove any dissimilar accounting policies that may exist. Subsidiaries are consolidated from the date control is transferred to the 
Group and cease to be consolidated from the date control is transferred from the Group. All inter-company balances, profits and 
transactions are eliminated.
2.4 Product classification
Insurance contracts are those contracts that transfer significant insurance risk. The significance of insurance risk is dependent on 
both the probability of an insured event and the magnitude of its potential effect to the policyholder.
Once a contract has been classified as an insurance contract, it remains an insurance contract for the remainder of its lifetime, 
even if the insurance risk reduces significantly during this period.
Where the Group has issued financial guarantee contracts these have been regarded as insurance contracts and have been 
accounted for in accordance with IFRS 4 ‘Insurance Contracts’.
2.5 Other accounting policies
2.5.1 Insurance contracts
(a) Premiums
Premiums written relate to business incepted during the year, together with any differences between booked premiums for prior 
years and those previously accrued, and include estimates of premiums due but not yet receivable or notified, less an allowance 
for cancellations. Premiums are accreted to the income statement on a pro rata basis over the term of the related policy, except 
for those contracts where the period of risk differs significantly from the contract period. In these circumstances, premiums are 
recognised over the period of risk in proportion to the amount of insurance protection provided. Reinstatement premiums are 
accreted to the income statement on a pro rata basis over the term of the original policy to which it relates. Premiums are shown 
net of premium taxes and other levies on premiums. Pipeline premium estimates are typically based on using standard actuarial 
projection techniques (e.g. Basic Chain Ladder) on the key assumption that historical development of premiums is representative 
of future development.
(b) Profit commissions and overriding commissions receivable
Profit commission income arising from whole account quota share contracts is recognised when the economic benefits are 
highly probable. Profit commissions and overrider commissions are netted off commission costs which are included within the 
‘acquisition cost’ line in the income statement.
(c) Deferred acquisition costs
Commission and other acquisition costs incurred during the financial period that are related to securing new insurance contracts 
and/or renewing existing insurance contracts, but which relate to subsequent financial periods, are deferred to the extent that 
they are recoverable out of future revenue margins. Deferred acquisition costs are capitalised and amortised over the life of the 
policy to which they relate on a basis consistent with the earnings pattern of that policy.
(d) Claims incurred
Claims incurred comprise claims and claims handling costs paid in the year and changes in the outstanding claims provisions, 
including provisions for claims incurred but not reported and related expenses, together with any adjustments to claims from 
prior years. Claims handling costs are mainly those external costs related to the negotiation and settlement of claims. NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
134 Brit PLC Annual Report 2014
2 ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND BASIS OF PREPARATION (continued)
(e) Outstanding claims provisions
Outstanding claims represent the estimated ultimate cost of settling all claims (including direct and indirect claims settlement 
costs) arising from events which have occurred up to the date of the statement of financial position, including provision for 
claims incurred but not reported, less any amounts paid in respect of those claims. The Group does not discount its liabilities for 
unpaid claims, the ultimate cost of which cannot be known with certainty at the date of the statement of financial position.
(f) Provision for unearned premiums
The proportion of written premiums that relate to unexpired terms of policies in force at the date of the statement of financial 
position is deferred as a provision for unearned premiums, generally calculated on a time apportioned basis. The movement in 
the provision is taken to the income statement in order that revenue is recognised over the period of the risk.
(g) Liability adequacy tests
At the date of each statement of financial position, liability adequacy tests are performed, to ensure the adequacy of unearned 
premiums net of related deferred acquisition costs, employing the current estimates of future cash flows under its insurance 
contracts. If, as a result of these tests, the carrying amount of the Group’s insurance liabilities is found to be inadequate in 
comparison to the value of these future cash flows, the deficiency is charged to the income statement for the period by 
establishing an unexpired risk provision. The tests are performed at a whole account and portfolio level at the statement of 
financial position date to ensure the estimated costs of future claims and related deferred acquisition costs do not exceed the 
unearned premium provision.
(h) Reinsurance
The Group assumes and cedes reinsurance in the normal course of business. Premiums and claims on reinsurance assumed 
are recognised in the income statement along the same basis as direct business, taking into account the product classification. 
Reinsurance premiums ceded and reinsurance recoveries on claims incurred are included in the respective expense and income 
accounts. Reinsurance outwards premiums are earned according to the nature of the cover. ‘Losses occurring during’ policies are 
earned evenly over the policy period. ‘Risks attaching’ policies are expensed on the same basis as the inwards business being 
protected. Reinstatement premiums on both inwards and outwards business are accreted to the income statement on a pro rata 
basis over the term of the original policy to which they relate.
Reinsurance assets include amounts recoverable from reinsurance companies for paid and unpaid losses and loss adjustment 
expenses, and ceded unearned premiums. Amounts recoverable from reinsurers are calculated with reference to the claims 
liability associated with the reinsured risks. Revenues and expenses arising from reinsurance agreements are therefore 
recognised in accordance with the underlying risk of the business reinsured.
Gains or losses on buying reinsurance are recognised immediately in the income statement.
If a reinsurance asset is impaired, the Group reduces its carrying amount accordingly, and will immediately recognise the 
impairment loss in the income statement. A reinsurance asset will be deemed to be impaired if there is objective evidence, as a 
result of an event that occurred after initial recognition of the asset, that the Group may not receive all amounts due to it under 
the terms of the contract, and that the event has a reliably measurable impact on the amounts that the Group will receive from 
the reinsurer.
Gains or losses on buying retroactive reinsurance are recognised immediately in the income statement and are not amortised. 
Premiums ceded and claims reimbursed are presented on a gross basis in the consolidated income statement and statement of 
financial position as appropriate.   Brit PLC Annual Report 2014 135
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
(i) Syndicate assets and liabilities
For each managed syndicate on which the Group participates, the Group’s proportion of the syndicate’s assets and liabilities has 
been reflected in its consolidated statement of financial position. Syndicate assets are held subject to trust deeds for the benefit 
of the syndicate’s insurance creditors.
2.5.2 Revenue recognition
(a) Fee and commission income
Fee and commission income consists mainly of administration and broking fees charged to third parties. It is recognised in the 
accounting period in which the service is rendered by reference to completion of the specific transaction, assessed on the basis 
of the actual service provided as a proportion of the total services to be provided.
(b) Investment return
Investment income comprises all interest and dividend income and realised and unrealised gains and losses less investment 
management fees. Interest income is recognised using the effective interest method. Dividend income is recognised when the 
shareholders’ right to receive the payment is established.
Realised gains and losses on investments are calculated as the difference between net sales proceeds and cost and are 
recognised when the sale transaction occurs.
Unrealised gains and losses on investments are calculated as the difference between the valuation at the date of the statement 
of financial position and the valuation at the last statement of financial position or purchase price, if acquired during the year. 
Unrealised investment gains and losses include adjustments in respect of unrealised gains and losses recorded in prior years 
which have been realised during the year and are reported as realised gains and losses in the current year’s income statement.
2.5.3 Recognition and derecognition of financial assets and financial liabilities
Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognised when the Group becomes a party to the contractual provisions  
of the contract.
A financial asset is derecognised when either the contractual rights to the asset’s cash flows expire, or the asset is transferred  
and the transfer qualifies for derecognition under a combination of risks and rewards and control tests.
A financial liability is derecognised when it is extinguished which is when the obligation in the contract is discharged,  
cancelled or expired.
All ‘regular way purchases and sales’ of financial assets are recognised on the trade date, i.e. the date that the Group commits  
to purchase or sell the asset. Regular way purchases and sales are purchases and sales of financial assets that require delivery  
of assets within the time frame generally established by regulation or convention in the marketplace.
2.5.4 Investments
The Group has designated on initial recognition its financial assets held for investment purposes (investments) at fair value 
through profit or loss (FVTPL). This is in accordance with the Group’s documented investment strategy and consistent with 
investment risk being assessed on a portfolio basis. Information relating to investments is provided internally to the Group’s 
Directors and key managers on a fair value basis.
Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between 
market participants at the measurement date. The fair value of financial assets and liabilities traded in active markets (which 
are the principal markets or the most advantageous markets that maximise the amount that would be received to sell the asset 
or minimises the amount that would be paid to transfer the liability) are based on quoted market bid and ask price for both 
financial assets and financial liabilities respectively. NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
136 Brit PLC Annual Report 2014
2 ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND BASIS OF PREPARATION (continued)
The fair value of financial assets and liabilities that are not traded in an active market, including over-the-counter derivatives, is 
determined using valuation techniques. The Group uses a variety of methods and makes assumptions that are based on market 
conditions existing at each reporting date. Valuation techniques include the use of comparable recent arm’s length transactions, 
reference to other instruments that are substantially the same, discounted cash flow analysis, option pricing models and others 
commonly used by market participants and which make the maximum use of observable inputs.
Gains and losses on investments designated as FVTPL are recognised through the income statement. Interest income from 
investments in bonds and short-term investments is recognised at the effective interest rate. Interest receivable is shown 
separately in the statement of financial position based on the debt instruments’ stated rates of interest.
2.5.5 Derivatives
Derivative financial instruments include foreign exchange contracts, forward rate agreements, interest rate futures, currency and 
interest rate swaps and other financial instruments that derive their value mainly from underlying interest rates, foreign exchange 
rates, credit indices, commodity values or equity instruments. All derivatives are initially recognised in the statement of financial 
position at their fair value, which represents their cost. They are subsequently remeasured at their fair value, with the method of 
recognising movements in this value in the income statement. Fair values are obtained from quoted market prices or, if these are 
not available, by using valuation techniques such as discounted cash flow models or option pricing models.
All derivatives are carried as assets when the fair values are positive and as liabilities when the fair values are negative. Derivative 
contracts may be traded on an exchange or over-the-counter (OTC). Exchange-traded derivatives are standardised and include 
certain futures and option contracts. OTC derivative contracts are individually negotiated between contracting parties and 
include forwards and swaps.
Derivatives are subject to various risks including market, liquidity and credit risk, similar to those related to the underlying 
financial instruments. Many OTC transactions are contracted and documented under International Swaps and Derivatives 
Association (ISDA) master agreements or their equivalent, which are designed to provide legally enforceable set-off in the event 
of default, reducing the Group’s exposure to credit risk. The notional or contractual amounts associated with derivative financial 
instruments are not recorded as assets or liabilities on the statement of financial position as they do not represent the fair value 
of these transactions.
2.5.6 Intangible assets
(a) Syndicate participation rights
Lloyd’s syndicate participation rights that have been acquired on acquisition of a subsidiary are initially recognised at fair value. 
They are considered to have an indefinite useful life as they will provide benefits over an indefinite future period and are 
therefore not subject to an annual amortisation charge. The continuing value of the capacity is reviewed for impairment annually 
by reference to the expected future profit streams to be earned from the respective syndicate, with any impairment in value 
being charged to the income statement.
(b) Computer software
Acquired computer software licences are capitalised on the basis of the costs incurred to acquire and bring into use the specific 
software. Internal development costs that are directly associated with the production of identifiable and unique software 
products controlled by the Group are also capitalised where the cost can be measured reliably, the Group intends to and has 
adequate resources to complete development and the computer software will generate future economic benefits.
All computer software costs are finite life assets and amortised on a straight-line basis over their expected useful lives, not 
exceeding a period of five years.   Brit PLC Annual Report 2014 137
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
(c) Trade names and distribution channels
Trade names and distribution channels that have been acquired on acquisition of a subsidiary are initially recognised at fair 
value. They are deemed to be finite life assets and amortised on a straight-line basis over their expected useful economic  
lives, as follows:
Trade names         5 years
Distribution channels         15 years
(d) Renewal rights
Renewal rights are recognised at fair value upon acquisition and amortised straight line over their expected useful lives which 
varies between two and four years.
2.5.7 Property, plant and equipment
Property, plant and equipment are carried at cost, less accumulated depreciation and any impairment in value. Depreciation 
is calculated so as to write-off the cost over their estimated useful economic lives on a straight-line basis having regard to the 
residual value of each asset, as follows:
Office refurbishment costs, office machinery, furniture and equipment      5 years
Computers, servers, data storage devices, networks and other IT infrastructure     3 years
The assets’ residual values and useful lives are reviewed at the date of each statement of financial position and adjusted  
if appropriate.
An item of property, plant and equipment is derecognised upon disposal or when no future economic benefits are expected to 
arise from the continued use of the asset. Gains and losses on the disposal of property, plant and equipment are determined 
by comparing proceeds with the carrying amount of the asset and are included in the income statement. Costs for repairs and 
maintenance are expensed as incurred.
2.5.8 Impairment
Syndicate participation rights are not subjected to amortisation but are tested annually for impairment as they are an asset with 
an indefinite useful life. Other assets, except for assets arising from insurance contracts, are tested for impairment whenever 
events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable.
If the carrying value of an asset is impaired, it is reduced to the recoverable amount by an immediate charge to the income 
statement. The recoverable amount is the higher of an asset’s fair value less costs to sell and value in use.
Value in use is based on discounting cash flows at the Group’s weighted average cost of capital which is loaded where  
significant uncertainties exist. Assets are grouped at the lowest levels for which there are separately identifiable cash flows 
(cash-generating units).
Impairment reviews are made by comparing carrying value to recoverable amount.
2.5.9 Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents in the statement of financial position include cash in hand, deposits held at call with banks and  
other short-term highly liquid investments with a maturity of three months or less at the date of acquisition. NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
138 Brit PLC Annual Report 2014
2 ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND BASIS OF PREPARATION (continued)
2.5.10 Income taxes
Income tax comprises current and deferred tax. Income tax is recognised in the income statement except where it relates  
to an item which is recognised in equity.
(a) Current income tax
Current income tax is the expected tax payable on the taxable profit for the period using tax rates (and laws) enacted or 
substantively enacted at the date of the statement of financial position and any adjustment to the tax payable in respect of 
previous periods. The Group calculates current income tax using current income tax rates.
(b) Deferred income tax
Deferred income tax is provided in full, using the liability method, on temporary differences arising between the tax bases of 
assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts in the Consolidated Financial Statements. However, if the deferred income tax 
arises from initial recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction other than a business combination that at the time of the 
transaction affects neither accounting nor taxable profit or loss, it is not recognised.
Deferred income tax is determined using tax rates (and laws) that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the date of the 
statement of financial position and are expected to apply when the related deferred income tax asset is realised or the deferred 
income tax liability is settled.
Deferred income tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profit will be available against 
which the temporary differences can be utilised.
Deferred income tax relating to items recognised in other comprehensive income is also recognised in other  
comprehensive income.
Deferred income tax is provided on temporary differences arising on investments in subsidiaries and associates, except where 
the Group controls the timing of the reversal of the temporary difference and it is probable that the temporary difference will  
not reverse in the foreseeable future.
Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to offset current tax assets against 
current tax liabilities and when the deferred income taxes relate to the same fiscal authority.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are not discounted.
2.5.11 Employee benefits
The Group operates a defined contribution group personal pension plan and several other defined contribution schemes.  
It also makes payments into a number of personal money purchase pension plans. Contributions in respect of these schemes  
are charged to the income statement in the period to which they relate.
The Group also operates a defined benefit pension scheme. The asset recognised in the statement of financial position in 
respect of the defined benefit scheme is the fair value of the scheme assets less the present value of the defined benefit 
obligation which is determined by discounting the estimated future cash outflows. The discount rate is based on market yields 
at the reporting date of high-quality corporate bonds that have terms to maturity which approximate to those of the related 
pension liability.
Actuarial gains and losses are recognised immediately through other comprehensive income.   Brit PLC Annual Report 2014 139
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
The Group determines the net interest expense/income on the net defined benefit liability/asset for the period by applying the 
discount rate used to measure the defined benefit obligation at the beginning of the annual period to the net defined benefit 
liability/asset.
Past service costs arising in the period are recognised as an expense at the earlier of the date when the plan amendment or 
curtailment occurs and the date when the Group recognises related restructuring costs or termination benefits.
The Group recognises an accrual in respect of profit-sharing and bonus plans where a contractual obligation to employees exists 
or where there is a past practice that has created a constructive obligation.
2.5.12 Share‑based payments
The fair value of equity instruments granted under share-based payment plans are recognised as an expense and spread over 
the vesting period of the instrument. The total amount to be expensed is determined by reference to the fair value of the 
awards made at the grant date, excluding the impact of any non-market vesting conditions. At the date of each statement of 
financial position, the Group revises its estimate of the number of equity instruments that are expected to become exercisable. 
It recognises the impact of the revision of original estimates, if any, in the income statement, and a corresponding adjustment 
is made to equity over the remaining vesting period. The fair value of the awards and ultimate expense are not adjusted on a 
change in market vesting conditions during the vesting period.
2.5.13 Earnings per share
Basic earnings per share are calculated by dividing profit after tax attributable to equity shareholders of the parent company by 
the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue during the period.
Diluted earnings per share requires that the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue is adjusted to assume 
conversion of all dilutive potential ordinary shares. These arise from awards made under share-based incentive schemes. Share 
awards with performance conditions attaching to them are not considered to be dilutive unless these conditions have been met 
at the reporting date. 
Shares held in employee share trusts are excluded from the weighted average number of shares in issue until they have vested 
unconditionally with the employees. 
2.5.14 Own shares
Where the Company purchases its own share capital, the consideration paid is shown as a deduction from total shareholders’ 
equity. No gain or loss is recognised in the income statement on the purchase, sale, issue or cancellation of own shares and any 
consideration paid or received is recognised directly in equity.
2.5.15 Provisions and contingencies
Provisions are liabilities with uncertainties in the amount or timing of payments. Provisions are recognised if there is a present 
obligation as a result of past events, it is probable that an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits will be required 
to settle the obligation, and a reliable estimate of the amount of the obligation can be made at the date of the statement of 
financial position.
A contingent liability is a possible obligation that arises from past events or a present obligation that is not recognised as it is not 
probable that an outflow of resources will be required to settle the obligation or the amount of obligation cannot be measured 
with sufficient reliability. A contingent liability is disclosed but not recognised.
2.5.16 Leased assets
Where the Group enters into an operating lease, the payments (net of any incentives received from the lessor) are charged to 
the income statement on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
An operating lease is one in which the risks and rewards remain with the lessor. NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

2 ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND BASIS OF PREPARATION (continued)
2.5.17 Foreign currency translation
Items included in the Financial Statements of the parent and subsidiaries are measured using the functional currency which is 
the primary economic environment in which the entity operates. The Group presents its Consolidated Financial Statements in 
Sterling which is the functional currency of the parent.
Foreign currency transactions are recorded in the functional currency for each entity using the exchange rates prevailing at the 
dates of the transactions or at the average rate for the period when this is a reasonable approximation. Substantially all of the 
Group’s operations have Sterling as their functional currency. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies 
are translated at period end exchange rates. The resulting exchange differences on translation are recorded in the income 
statement. Non-monetary assets and liabilities that are measured at historical cost denominated in a foreign currency are not 
retranslated.
2.5.18 Borrowings
Borrowings are initially recognised at fair value, net of transaction costs incurred and subsequently stated at amortised cost. Fair 
value is normally determined by reference to the fair value of the proceeds received. Any difference between the initial carrying 
amount and the redemption value is recognised in the income statement over the period of the borrowings using the effective 
interest rate method.
2.5.19 Segmental reporting
An operating segment is a component of an entity that engages in business activities from which it may earn revenues and incur 
expenses, whose operating results are regularly reviewed by the entity’s chief operating decision-maker and for which discrete 
financial information is available.
2.5.20 Loans and receivables
Loans and receivables are financial assets with fixed or determinable payments. Loans and receivables are measured at 
amortised cost, using the effective interest rate method.
2.5.21 Offsetting of financial instruments
Financial assets and liabilities are offset and the net amount reported in the statement of financial position only when there is 
a legally enforceable right to offset the recognised amounts and there is an intention to settle on a net basis, or to realise the 
assets and settle the liability simultaneously.
2.5.22 Dividend and capital distributions
Dividend and capital distributions to the Company’s shareholders are recognised in the Group’s Financial Statements in the 
period in which they are declared and appropriately approved.
2.5.23 Collateral
The Group receives collateral from certain reinsurers and pledges collateral where required for regulatory purposes.
Collateral received in the form of cash is recognised as an asset on the statement of financial position with a corresponding 
liability for the repayment. Non-cash collateral received is not recognised on the statement of financial position.
Collateral pledged is not derecognised from the statement of financial position unless the Group defaults on its obligations 
under the relevant agreement.   Brit PLC Annual Report 2014 141

3  CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES AND JUDGEMENTS IN APPLYING  
ACCOUNTING POLICIES
3.1 Introduction
The Group makes various assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities. Estimates and judgements are 
regularly re-evaluated and are based on a combination of historical experience and other factors, including exposure analysis, 
expectations of future experience and expert judgement.
3.2 The ultimate liability arising from claims made under insurance contracts
The estimation of the ultimate liability arising from claims made under insurance contracts is the Group’s most critical accounting 
estimate. There are several sources of uncertainty that need to be considered in the estimate of the amounts that the Group will 
ultimately pay to settle such claims. Significant areas requiring estimation and judgement include:
• Estimates of the amount of any liability in respect of claims notified but not settled and incurred but not reported claims 
(IBNR) to be included within provisions for inwards insurance and reinsurance contracts;
• The corresponding estimate of the amount of outwards reinsurance recoveries which will become due as a result of the 
estimated claims on inwards business;
• The recoverability of amounts due from reinsurers; and
• Estimates of the proportion of exposure which has expired in the period as represented by the earned proportion of 
premiums written.
The assumptions used and the manner in which these estimates and judgements are made are set out below, including the 
reserving process for the estimation of gross, and net of reinsurance, ultimate premiums and claims:
• Quarterly statistical data is produced in respect of gross and net premiums and claims (paid and incurred);
• Projections of ultimate premiums, reinstatement premiums and claims are produced by the internal actuarial department 
using standard actuarial projection techniques (e.g. Basic Chain Ladder, Bornhuetter-Ferguson, Initial Expected Loss Ratio). 
The Basic Chain Ladder and Bornhuetter-Ferguson projection methods are based on the key assumption that historical 
development of premiums and claims is representative of future development. Claims inflation is taken into account in the 
initial expected loss ratio selections but is otherwise assumed to be in line with historical inflation trends, unless explicit 
adjustments for other drivers of inflation such as legislative developments are deemed appropriate.
• Some classes of business have characteristics which do not necessarily lend themselves easily to statistical estimation 
techniques, e.g. due to low data volumes. In such cases, for example, a policy-by-policy review may also be carried out to 
supplement statistical estimates;
• In the event of catastrophe losses, and prior to detailed claims information becoming available, claims provision estimates 
are compiled using a combination of output from specific recognised modelling software and detailed reviews of contracts 
exposed to the event in question;
• The initial ultimate selections derived by the actuarial department, along with the underlying key assumptions and 
methodology, are discussed with class underwriters, divisional underwriting directors and the claims team at ‘Pre-Committee’ 
meetings. The actuarial department may make adjustments to the initial ultimates following these meetings;
• Following the completion of the ‘Pre-Committee’ meetings and peer review process within the actuarial department, 
the ultimate selections (actuarial estimate), assumptions, methodology and uncertainties are presented to the Reserving 
Committee, chaired by the Chief Financial Officer and reporting to the Executive Management Committee, for discussion 
and debate;
• Following review of the actuarial estimate, the Reserving Committee recommends the Committee estimate to be adopted in 
the Financial Statements; and
• Claims provisions are subject to independent external actuarial review at least annually. NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
142 Brit PLC Annual Report 2014
3  CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES AND JUDGEMENTS IN APPLYING  
ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued)
The results of the independent external actuarial review are presented to both the Reserving Committee and the Audit 
Committee with key assumptions, methodologies and uncertainties highlighted. The purpose of the external review is  
to provide both committees with an independent actuarial view of reserve requirements compared to the recommendations  
of the internal actuarial department and provide additional information on which to base the establishment of the reserves  
for the Group.
The estimates and judgements are applied in line with the overall reserving philosophy and seek to state the claims provisions 
on a best estimate, undiscounted basis. A management risk margin is also applied over and above the actuarial best estimate to 
allow for the inherent uncertainty within the best estimate reserve position.
In addition to claims provisions, the reserve for future loss adjustment expenses is also subject to estimation with consideration 
being given to the level of internal and third-party loss adjustment expenses incurred annually. The estimated loss adjustment 
expenses are expressed as a percentage of gross claims reserves and the reasonableness of the estimate is assessed through 
benchmarking. Further judgements are made as to the recoverability of amounts due from reinsurers. Provisions for bad debts 
are made specifically, based on the solvency of reinsurers, internal and external ratings, payment experience with them and any 
disputes of which the Group is aware.
The carrying value at the date of the statement of financial position of gross claims reported and loss adjustment expenses 
and claims incurred but not reported were £2,057.9m (2013: £2,097.7m) as set out in Note 21 to the accounts. The amount of 
reinsurance recoveries estimated at that date is £445.4m (2013: £374.0m).
3.3 Pipeline premiums
Written premiums include pipeline premiums of £292.2m (2013: £234.4m) which represent future premiums receivable in respect 
of in-force insurance contracts. Pipeline premium estimates are typically based on standard actuarial projection techniques  
(e.g. Basic Chain Ladder) on the key assumption that historical development of premiums is representative of future 
development.
3.4 Intangible assets
Intangible assets with indefinite useful lives are tested for impairment on an annual basis in accordance with IAS 36 ‘Impairment 
of Assets’. Determining the assumptions used in the test requires estimation. The indefinite useful life intangible assets of the 
Group consist of syndicate participation rights and their carrying amount at the date of the statement of financial position was 
£45.4m (2013: £45.4m). For further information, refer to Note 17.
3.5 Financial investments
Financial investments are carried in the statement of financial position at fair value. The carrying amount of financial investments 
at the date of the statement of financial position was £2,259.8m (2013: £2,275.9m). Determining the fair value of certain 
investments requires estimation.
The Group values investments using designated methodologies, estimations and assumptions. These securities, which are 
reported at fair value on the consolidated statement of financial position, represent the majority of the invested assets. The 
measurement basis for assets carried at fair value is categorised into a ‘fair value hierarchy’ in accordance with the valuation 
inputs and consistent with IFRS 13 ‘Fair Value Measurement’. The fair value hierarchy gives the highest priority to quoted prices 
in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (level one); the middle priority to fair values other than quoted prices based 
on observable market information (level two); and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs that reflect the assumptions that 
we consider market participants would normally use (level three). At 31 December 2014, financial investments amounting to 
£202.6m (2013: £331.7m) were classified as level three.
The classification within the fair value hierarchy is based on the lowest level of significant input to its valuation. Any change to 
investment valuations may affect our results of operations and reported financial condition. For further information, refer to Note 23.   Brit PLC Annual Report 2014 143
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
4 RISK MANAGEMENT POLICIES
This Note provides details of key risks that the Group is exposed to and explains the Group’s strategies and the role of 
management in mitigating these risks. 
4.1 Insurance risk
Insurance risk arises from the possibility of an adverse financial result due to actual experience being different from that 
expected when an insurance product was designed and priced. The actual performance of insurance contracts is subject to the 
inherent uncertainty in the occurrence, timing and amount of the final insurance liabilities. This is the principal risk the Group is 
exposed to as the Group’s primary function is to underwrite insurance contracts. The risk arises due to the possibility of insurance 
contracts being underpriced, under-reserved or subject to unforeseen catastrophe claims.
The areas of insurance risk discussed below include underwriting (including aggregate exposure management), reinsurance  
and reserving.
4.1.1 Underwriting risk
(a) Introduction
This is the risk that insurance premiums will not be sufficient to cover the future losses and associated expenses. It arises from 
the fluctuations in the frequency and severity of financial losses incurred through the underwriting process by the Group as a 
result of unpredictable events.
The Group is also exposed to the risks resulting from its underwriters accepting risks for premiums which are insufficient to 
cover the ultimate claims which result from such policies. This risk is considered to be heightened in the current competitive 
underwriting environment which is resulting in significant downwards pressure on premium rates. This trend in premium rates has 
been factored into the Group’s pricing models and risk management tools and is continually monitored to assess whether any 
corrective action is required. Additional controls over the underwriting strategy are described in the section below.
The Group writes all of its business through Lloyd’s and therefore can take advantage of Lloyd’s centralised infrastructure and 
service support. Lloyd’s also has an established global distribution framework, with extensive licensing agreements providing 
the Group access to over 200 territories. Exclusively using the Lloyd’s platform subjects the Group to a number of resulting 
underwriting risks. The Group relies on the efficient functioning of the Lloyd’s market and if for any reason, Brit Syndicates Ltd 
is restricted or otherwise unable to write insurance through the Lloyd’s market, this would have a material adverse effect on the 
Group’s business and results of operations. In particular, any damage to the brand or reputation of Lloyd’s, increase in tax levies 
imposed on Lloyd’s participants or deterioration in Lloyd’s asset base when compared with its liabilities may have a material 
adverse effect on the Group’s ability to write new business.
BSL also benefits from the ability to write business based on the Lloyd’s financial rating, which allows the Group to write  
more business as part of the Lloyd’s platform. A downgrade in Lloyd’s financial strength ratings may have an adverse effect  
on the Group.
(b) Controls over underwriting strategy
The Board sets the Group’s underwriting strategy for accepting and managing underwriting risk. The PLC Underwriting 
Committee chaired by an independent non-executive Director, meets quarterly and is responsible for the management of 
underwriting risk in line with the RMF using specific measurable targets/actions and any breaches are reported to Executive 
Management, the Risk Oversight Committee and the Board. 
The UK Underwriting Committee meets monthly to drive the underwriting strategy and to monitor performance against the 
plans. The assessment of underwriting performance is all-encompassing applying underwriting KPIs, technical pricing MI, 
premium monitoring, delegated underwriting operations and claims MI. The risks are managed by the committee in line with 
the underwriting risk policy and within the risk tolerance set by the Board. The underwriting risk policy also sets out a number of 
controls, which are summarised below.  NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
144 Brit PLC Annual Report 2014
4 RISK MANAGEMENT POLICIES (continued)
The Group carries out a detailed annual business planning process for each of its underwriting units. The resulting plans set 
out premium, territorial and aggregate limits and reinsurance protection thresholds for all classes of business and represent 
a key tool in managing concentration risk. Performance against the plans is monitored on a regular basis by the Underwriting 
Committee as well as by the Boards of the regulated entities. A dedicated exposure management team also performs Realistic 
Disaster Scenario (RDS) analysis on a regular basis to ensure that the Group’s net losses remain within its risk appetite.
The Group has developed underwriting guidelines, limits of authority and business plans which are binding upon all staff 
authorised to underwrite. These are detailed and specific to underwriters and classes of business. Gross and net line size limits 
are in place for each class of business with additional restrictions in place on catastrophe exposed business.
A proportion of the Group’s insurance risks are written by third parties under delegated underwriting authorities, with the 
remaining being written through individual risk acceptances or through reinsurance treaties. The third parties are closely vetted 
in advance and are subject to tight reporting requirements. In addition, the performance of these contracts is closely monitored 
by underwriters and regular audits are carried out.
The technical pricing framework ensures that the pricing process in the Group is appropriate. It ensures pricing methodologies 
are demonstrable and transparent and that technical (or benchmark) prices are assessed for each risk. The underwriting and 
actuarial functions work together to maintain the pricing models and assess the difference between technical price and actual 
price. The framework also ensures that sufficient data is recorded and checked by underwriters to enable the Group to maintain 
an effective rate monitoring process.
Compliance is checked through both a peer review process and, periodically, by the Group’s Internal Audit department, which is 
entirely independent of the underwriting units.
In order to limit risk, the number of reinstatements per policy is limited, deductibles are imposed, policy exclusions are applied 
and whenever allowed by statute, maximum indemnity limits are put in place per insured event.
(c) Underwriting risk profile
The core insurance portfolio of property, energy and casualty covers a variety of largely uncorrelated events and also provides 
some protection against the underwriting cycle as different classes are at different points in the underwriting cycle. The 
underwriting portfolio is managed to target top quartile underwriting performance and the mix of business is continually 
adjusted based on the current environment (including the current pricing strength of each class). This assessment is conducted 
as part of the business planning and strategy process which operates annually and uses inputs from the technical pricing 
framework. The business plan is approved by the Board and is monitored monthly.
The Group underwrites a well-diversified portfolio across multiple regions and classes. While underlying risk and the policyholder 
may be situated anywhere in the world, more than 90% of the GWP of the Group in 2014 was sourced in London. The other 
business written by the syndicate is sourced through a wholly-owned service company in the United States, which accounted 
for 7.8% of the Group’s annual GWP in 2014. The Group has also recently started writing business through the Lloyd’s China 
Platform and from its office in Bermuda (which opened in September 2013). In 2014, 21.3% of the Group’s GWP was reinsured 
to third parties.   Brit PLC Annual Report 2014 145
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
(d) Geographical concentration of premium
The Group enters into policies with policyholders from all over the world, with the underlying risk relating to premiums spread 
worldwide. This allows the Group to benefit from a wide geographic diversification of risk. The three principal locations of the 
Group’s policyholders are the United States, UK and Ireland and mainland Europe. The concentration of insurance premium 
before and after reinsurance by the location of the underlying risk is summarised below:
          Gross Net 
         premiums premiums 
         written written 
         £m £m
2014
United States        501.4 401.9
United Kingdom        96.7 72.6
Europe (excluding UK)        84.0 51.9
Other (including worldwide)        620.0 498.5
Total        1,302.1 1,024.9

Europe (excluding UK)        61.8 41.8
Other (including worldwide)        609.4 509.6
Total        1,185.7 956.3
The nature of the London Market business is such that the insureds and reinsureds are often operating on a multi-territory or 
worldwide basis and hence coverage is often provided on a worldwide basis. Premiums written on a multi-territory or worldwide 
basis are included in ‘Other’ in the table above.
(e) Portfolio mix
The Group’s third party underwriting takes place through the syndicate underwriting business in a wide variety of business lines. 
The business lines can be broken down into four principal categories: (i) short-tail direct insurance; (ii) long-tail direct insurance; 
(iii) short-tail reinsurance; and (iv) long-tail reinsurance.
The breakdown of premium before reinsurance by principal lines of business is summarised below:
          2014  2013 
         gross  gross 
         premiums  premiums

Long-tail direct insurance Professional lines, specialty lines, specialist liability  339.2 26% 303.9 26%
Short-tail reinsurance Property treaty     109.6 8% 139.6 12%
Long-tail reinsurance Casualty treaty     135.7 10% 141.4 12%
Other Other underwriting and other corporate   – <1% 1.6 <1%
Total       1,302.1 100% 1,185.7 100%
The Group underwrites a business mix of both insurance and reinsurance, long and short-tail business across a number of 
geographic areas which results in a diversification of the Group’s portfolio. The business mix is monitored on an ongoing basis 
with particular focus on the short-tail vs. long-tail split and the proportion of delegated underwriting business. Long-tail business 
makes up 36.5% of the portfolio at 31 December 2014 (2013: 37.4%) and delegated underwriting represents 38.0% (2013: 
41.8%). Underwriting risk is mainly driven by the syndicate’s US catastrophe exposure. Casualty Treaty is also a driver due to its 
long-tail exposure. NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
146 Brit PLC Annual Report 2014
4 RISK MANAGEMENT POLICIES (continued)
(i) Short‑tail direct insurance
Short-tail insurance generally refers to lines of business where the claims are typically settled within a short time of the claim 
being made; therefore, they are typically classes where a large element of the claims is property damage.
The Group’s short-tail business consists of six principal lines of business:
Property  Property coverage including business interruption on a worldwide basis and delegated 
underwriting business predominantly in North America.
Marine  Coverage for cargo (including specie and fine art), hull (including yacht) and marine liability.
Energy  Coverage for upstream (offshore) and midstream activities related to oil and 
gas production.
US specialty  Public and non-profit package on both a self-insured retention (SIR) and first dollar basis; 
property and liability package business for US criminal justice service operations; property 
direct and facultative reinsurance.
Accident and health  Coverage for personal accident (including kidnap and ransom), bloodstock and 
contingency.
Terrorism, political and aerospace  Coverage for terrorism (including aviation war), political and credit risks, and satellites 
at both launch and in-orbit.
The key risks on short-tail business are exposures to catastrophe claims, particularly US windstorms, earthquakes and  
terrorist events.
The property lines are also exposed to an increased frequency of fire and weather-related events. Coverage on energy is 
provided in respect of physical damage and business interruption/loss of income and would be exposed to large individual 
claims and extreme catastrophe losses. Within US specialty, the syndicate writes business in property direct and facultative 
reinsurance exposed to wind, earthquake and flood catastrophe claims as well as expanding in a number of niche casualty 
lines. Accident and health offers further diversification due to low correlation with other business lines. Personal accident has 
the potential to suffer from large losses due to a high concentration of multiple deaths from a catastrophe or large claims from 
highly valued insured individuals. Medical expense claims are subject to high inflationary costs and may experience a high claim 
frequency. Both bloodstock and contingency classes have exposure to multiple claims from a single event/location. Terrorism, 
aerospace and political classes have key exposures to single catastrophe events and terrorist events or a series of losses.
(ii) Long‑tail direct insurance
Long-tail insurance refers to insurance where on average the claims are not settled for several years after the expiry of the policy. 
The long-tail direct insurance business can be categorised into two principal lines of business:
Casualty  Includes cover for financial institutions, legal expenses, directors’ and officers’, and professional lines.
Specialist liability  Cover for employers’ liability and public liability both in the UK and internationally but excluding the US.
Key exposures on casualty lines lie with increasing claim frequency due to global recessionary events or international systemic 
malpractice. The specialist liability portfolio is subject to large losses resulting in bodily injury claims. This portfolio is also 
exposed to the risk of latent claims arising from risks which were not envisaged at the time of writing the policy.
(iii) Short‑tail reinsurance
The Group’s short-tail reinsurance business centres around property treaty. This typically covers catastrophic loss accumulation  
or individual large loss ceded by insurance and reinsurance company clients. The key exposures which property treaty is 
exposed to are US windstorms and Californian earthquakes. Property treaty also has exposures to Japanese earthquakes and 
European windstorms.   Brit PLC Annual Report 2014 147
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Property treaty Catastrophe excess of loss and risk excess of loss reinsurance.
(iv) Long‑tail reinsurance
Introduction
The Group’s long-tail reinsurance business centres around casualty treaty. Core lines of business include Genral Liability, 
Professional Indemnity/Financial Institutions/Directors and Officers’, Workers’ Compensation, Medical Malpractice, Accident & 
Health, and other accident classes including Property Terror.
Casualty treaty  Casualty and accident treaty reinsurance. Worldwide portfolio, written on excess of loss basis (currently only 
one specialist quota share contract written). The largest regional block is the US and Canada. The account is 
a mix of risk, catastrophe and clash business.
The key risks this division is exposed to include exposure to man-made catastrophe claims such as terrorism, increased claim 
activity in the event of an economic downturn and the potential for latent claims which were not foreseen at the time the policies 
were underwritten. This division contains the longest tailed liabilities the Group holds, i.e. there can be a significant delay 
between the notification and final settlement of a claim. This delay can result in the final settlement being subject to significant 
claims inflation.
Aggregate exposure management
The Group is exposed to the potential of large claims from natural catastrophe events. The Group’s catastrophe risk appetite 
is set by the Board who may adjust limits to reflect market conditions. Overall, the Group has a maximum catastrophe risk 
tolerance for major catastrophe events as measured through RDS losses (such as a Florida Miami windstorm) of 30% of 
Brit PLC Group level net tangible assets. This equates to a maximum acceptable loss (after all reinsurance) of £229.7m at 
31 December 2014.
The Group closely monitors aggregation of exposure to natural catastrophe events against agreed risk appetites using stochastic 
catastrophe modelling tools, along with knowledge of the business, historical loss information and geographical accumulations. 
Analysis and monitoring also measures the effectiveness of the Group’s reinsurance programmes. Stress and scenario tests are 
also run, such as Lloyd’s and internally developed Realistic Disaster Scenarios (RDS). The selection of the RDS is adjusted with 
development of the business. Below are the key RDS losses to the Group for all classes combined (unaudited):

4 RISK MANAGEMENT POLICIES (continued)
Actual results may differ materially from the losses above given the significant uncertainties within model assumptions, 
techniques and simulations applied to calculate these event loss estimates. There could also be unmodelled losses which result 
in actual losses exceeding these figures. Moreover, the portfolio of insured risks changes dynamically over time.
Sensitivity to changes in net claims ratio
The Group profit on ordinary activities before tax is sensitive to an independent 1% change in the net claims ratio (excluding the 
effect of foreign exchange on non-monetary items) for each class of business as follows:
        Movement in profit Movement in profit
        year ended year ended
        31 December 2014 31 December 2013
        £m % £m %
Short-tail direct insurance      5.1 52% 5.0 52%
Long-tail direct insurance      2.5 26% 2.1 22%
Short-tail reinsurance      0.7 8% 0.9 10%
Long-tail reinsurance      1.3 13% 1.4 15%
Other      0.1 1% 0.1 1%
Total      9.7 100% 9.5 100%
Subject to taxation, the impact on shareholders’ equity would be the same as that on profit following a change in the  
net claims ratio.
4.1.2 Reinsurance
The Group purchases reinsurance to manage its exposure to individual risks and aggregation of risks arising from individual  
large claims and catastrophe events. This allows the Group to mitigate exposure to insurance losses against the risk appetite, 
reduce volatility of reported results and protect capital.
Proportional quota share reinsurance is purchased to provide protection against claims arising either from individual large claims 
or aggregation of losses. Quota share reinsurance is also used to manage the Group‘s net exposure to classes of business where 
the Group’s risk appetite is lower than the efficient operating scale of the class of business on a gross of reinsurance basis. These 
placements are reviewed on the basis of market conditions.
The Group also has in place a comprehensive programme of excess of loss reinsurances to protect itself from severe size or 
frequency of losses:
• Facultative reinsurance is used to reduce risk relating to individual contracts. The amount of cover bought varies by class of 
business. Facultative reinsurance is also used as a tool to manage the net line size on individual risks to within tolerance.
• Risk excess of loss reinsurance is used to protect a range of individual inwards contracts which could give rise to individual 
large claims. The optimal net retention per risk is assessed for each class of business given the Group’s risk appetite during 
the business planning exercise.
• An aggregate catastrophe excess of loss cover is in place to protect the Group against combined property claims from 
multiple policies resulting from catastrophe events. This is supplemented by specific covers for peril regions, catastrophe 
swaps and industry loss warrantees where they are a cost-efficient means to ensure that the Group remains within its 
catastrophe risk appetite.   Brit PLC Annual Report 2014 149
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Given the fundamental importance of reinsurance protection to the Group’s risk management, the Group has in place internal 
controls and processes to ensure that the reinsurance arrangements provide appropriate protection of capital and maintain our 
ability to meet policyholder obligations. The Head of Outwards Reinsurance, the CEO of Brit Global Specialty and Chief Risk 
Officer propose external reinsurance arrangements with input from class underwriters for class level reinsurance. The CEO of 
Brit Global Specialty proposes reinsurance arrangements with BIG. All reinsurance purchases must be signed off by the Group’s 
Underwriting Committee. The Head of Outwards Reinsurance monitors and reports on the placement of reinsurance protections.
The Group remains exposed to a number of risks relating to its reinsurance programme:
• It is possible for extremely severe catastrophe losses to exhaust the reinsurance purchased. Any losses exceeding the 
reinsurance protection would be borne by the Group.
• Some parts of the programme have limited reinstatements which limit the amount that may be recovered from second or 
subsequent claims. If the entirety of the cover is exhausted, it may not be possible to purchase additional reinsurance at a 
reasonable price.
• A dispute may arise with a reinsurer which may mean the recoveries received are lower than anticipated.
These risks are managed through a combination of techniques and controls including exposure management, capital modelling 
and internal actuarial review of outward reinsurance costs. The counterparty risk in relation to reinsurance purchased is managed 
by the Group’s Credit Committee. This is further discussed in the credit risk section below.
4.1.3 Reserving risk
Reserving risk arises as the actual cost of losses for policyholder obligations incurred before 31 December 2014 will differ from 
the established reserves due to inaccurate assumptions or unforeseen circumstances. This is a key risk for the Group as the 
reserves for unpaid losses represent the largest component of the Group’s liabilities and are inherently uncertain. The Reserving 
Committee is responsible for the management of Syndicate 2987’s reserving risk, and the BIG Management Committee 
performs a similar function for BIG.
The Group has a rigorous process for establishing reserves for insurance claim liabilities and a number of controls are used to 
mitigate reserving risk. The reserving process starts with controls over claims data which ensure complete and accurate recording 
of all paid and notified claims. Claims staff validate policy terms and conditions, adjust claims and investigate suspicious or 
disputed claims in accordance with the Group’s claims policy. Case reserves are set for notified claims using the experience of 
specialist claims staff, underwriters and external experts where necessary.
While the case reserve is expected to be sufficient to meet the claims amount when it is settled, incurred but not reported (IBNR) 
claims require additional reserves. This is particularly the case for the longest tailed classes of business where the final settlement 
can occur several years after the claim occurred. Actuarial triangulation techniques are employed by the Group’s experienced 
actuaries to establish the IBNR reserve. These techniques project IBNR reserves based on historical development of paid and 
incurred claims by underwriting year. For the most uncertain claims, the triangulation techniques are supplemented by additional 
methods to ensure the established reserve is appropriate. The actuarial team work closely with other business functions such 
as underwriting, claims and exposure management to ensure that they have a full understanding of the emerging claims 
experience across the Group. Further details on the actuarial methods used can be found in Note 21.
The Group’s reserving policy sets out the approach to estimating claims provisions and is designed to produce accurate 
and reliable estimates that are consistent over time and across classes of business. The actuarial best estimate set out in the 
policy is subject to sign-off by the Reserving Committee, chaired by the Chief Financial Officer and reporting to the Executive 
Management Committee, as part of the formal governance arrangements for the Group. The estimate agreed by the 
committees is used as a basis for the Group Financial Statements. A management risk margin is also applied over and above 
the actuarial best estimate to allow for the inherent uncertainty within the best estimate reserve position and wider inherent 
uncertainty across the economic and insurance environment. This margin increases the reserves reflected in the Group Financial 
Statements above the mean expectation. Finally, the reserves in the Financial Statements are presented to the Audit Committee 
for recommendation to the Board who are responsible for the final sign-off. The reserves are subject to an independent external 
actuarial review at least annually. NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
150 Brit PLC Annual Report 2014
4 RISK MANAGEMENT POLICIES (continued)
The reserves can be more or less than is required to meet the claims arising from earned business. The level of uncertainty 
varies significantly between the classes written by the Group but typically is highest for those classes where there are significant 
delays in the settlement of the final claim amount. More specifically, the key areas of uncertainty within the Group’s reserves 
are considered to be claims from the casualty treaty and specialty liability classes. The issues contributing to this heightened 
uncertainty are common to all entities which write such business.
Further details on the reserve profile and claims development tables can be found in Note 21.
4.2 Investment risk management
4.2.1 Introduction
This section describes the Group’s approach to managing its investment risk, from both a quantitative and a qualitative 
perspective. Investment risk includes market risk (which is covered in section 4.3), investment credit risk (which is covered in 
section 4.4) and liquidity risk (which is covered in section 4.5).
4.2.2 Investment governance framework
Investment risk is managed in line with the elements of the Group Risk Management Framework (RMF) – identification, 
measurement and management. The Board has overall responsibility for determining the investment strategy, including defining 
the amount of risk tolerance. This is achieved through investment policies, guidelines and the Group’s strategic asset allocation, 
by which the assets are managed, which reflect the risk appetite and the business strategy of the Group. The Group’s strategic 
asset allocation is discussed is section 4.2.4 below.
The Investment Committee has been mandated to review, advise and make recommendations to the Board on investment 
strategy with a view to optimising the Group’s investment performance. The Investment Committee can assign the management 
of these assets to external investment and fund managers as well as to the internal investment team.
The Risk Oversight Committee ensures that the investment risk is managed within the framework and also reports to the Board. 
An Operational Risk Working Group oversees the operational risk that is relevant to the investment management function.
Monthly information is provided covering portfolio composition, performance, forecasting and the results of stress and scenario 
tests. Any operational issues and breaches to the Risk Appetite Framework are reported to the Risk Oversight Committee and 
the Board quarterly.
4.2.3 Risk tolerance
Investment risk tolerances are set by the Board, defining the Group’s appetite to investments earnings risk, solvency risk due 
purely to investment, currency risk and liquidity risk. The appetite to these elements of investment risk is derived from the overall 
risk appetite and business strategy of the Group and reflects a number of factors, including the current and expected economic 
climate, capital management strategy, liquidity needs and asset liability matching (ALM) policy. The investment risk tolerance 
helps determine the strategic asset allocation.
Risk metrics are monitored and reported on regularly to ensure that performance is within the Board-approved levels, and limits 
continue to remain appropriate, within the governance framework highlighted above.
4.2.4 Strategic asset allocation
The strategic asset allocation represents the medium-term target asset allocation across the economic cycle with the aim to 
optimise risk-adjusted returns. Funds are allocated across various asset classes defined by type or risk reflecting entity-level 
considerations and governance matters. Tactical ranges (known as the tactical asset allocation) around the asset allocation in the 
strategic asset allocation provide flexibility to optimise the balance between risk and return.   Brit PLC Annual Report 2014 151
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
The strategic asset allocation has been designed and is managed within the constraints of the Group’s Credit, Foreign Exchange, 
Liquidity, and ALM Policies and Guidelines. The strategic asset allocation, the tactical asset allocation and the investment 
guidelines form part of the guidelines framework that is set by the Investment Committee and approved by the Board, in line 
with the Group’s risk appetite and business strategy.
4.2.5 Solvency matching
Assets are considered by both currency and duration profile in relation to the liabilities thereby managing the impact of foreign 
exchange and interest rate risk on the solvency position.
Under this strategy, the total assets of each Group underwriting entity are sought to be held in currencies in proportion to the 
currencies in that entity’s technical provisions. The Group seeks to implement this through the use of cash, investments and 
foreign exchange forward contracts in the respective currencies.
For each Group underwriting entity, a solvency matched duration target is calculated that seeks to minimise the sensitivity of the 
Group to changes in interest rates impacting its solvency position. Within the investment guidelines for each entity, limits above 
and below this solvency matched position are stipulated. Cash, investments and interest rate derivatives are structured to target 
appropriate positioning within this range recognising the current yield curve.
4.2.6 Investment management
The Group outsources investment management where it is believed to be in its best interest. Where the Group sees fit, 
investment activities will also be carried out, analysed and monitored by the investment department.
The Group aims to appoint ‘best-in-class’ managers, targeting their specific area of expertise. The managers are subject to a 
rigorous manager selection process. The Group also monitors and controls its third-party investment managers on an ongoing 
basis. Investment management agreements with each internal and external manager document the relevant guidelines and 
procedures in place to deal with monitoring of performance and controls.
The investment guidelines specify the allowable strategic asset allocations for each investing entity along with the detailed 
concentration limits surrounding each of the investment portfolios. The tactical ranges around the asset allocation provide 
flexibility to optimise the balance between risk and return. Investment manager agreements are constructed so that in aggregate 
the investment portfolios are consistent with the parameters set out in the investment guidelines.
The investment guidelines, derived from the strategic asset allocation and tactical asset allocation, issued to fund managers 
stipulate exposure limits for counterparties, credit quality and subordination levels to help control credit risk.
4.3 Market risk
4.3.1 Introduction
Market risk is the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of changes in market 
prices. Market risk comprises three types of risk: interest rate risk, currency risk and other price risk. Credit risk on financial 
investments and cash is covered in the credit risk section.
4.3.2 Interest rate risk
Introduction
Interest rate risk is the risk that the fair value and/or future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of changes 
in interest rates. The Group is exposed to interest rate risk through its investment portfolio, borrowings and cash and cash 
equivalents. The sensitivity of the price of these financial exposures is indicated by their respective durations. This is defined as 
the modified duration which is the change in the price of the security subject to a 100 basis points parallel shift in interest rates. 
The greater the duration of a security, the greater the possible price volatility. NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Total    1,371.4 415.3 251.5 505.8 47.6 2,591.6
The Group takes into account the duration of its required capital, targeting an investment portfolio duration that, under a 
variation in interest rates, preserves the solvency ratio of the Group. The duration of the investment portfolio is then set within an 
allowable range relative to the targeted duration. This is achieved by the use of interest rate derivatives.
As the claims liabilities are measured on an undiscounted basis, the reported liabilities are not sensitive to changes in interest 
rates. This leads to the conflict between targeting a longer duration to protect the solvency position against movements in 
interest rates, while a shorter duration for the assets will reduce the possible volatility around the income statement.

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
4.3.3 Currency risk
Introduction
Currency risk is the risk that the fair value of assets and liabilities or future cash flows will fluctuate as a result of movements in 
the rates of foreign exchange. As the Group reporting currency is Sterling it is exposed to currency risk because it underwrites 
insurance business internationally, dealing in five main currencies: US dollars, Sterling, Canadian dollars, Euros and Australian 
dollars. All other currencies are included as Sterling.
The split of assets and liabilities for each of the Group’s main currencies, converted to Sterling, is set out in the table below:
      GBP US $ conv. CAD $ conv. EUR € conv. AUS $ conv. Total conv.
At 31 December 2014    £m £m £m £m £m £m
Total assets    779.1 2,221.6 330.4 374.5 102.0 3,807.6
Total liabilities    701.6 1,819.4 167.8 222.9 68.2 2,979.9
Net assets    77.5 402.2 162.6 151.6 33.8 827.7

Total assets    813.3 2,013.7 294.7 378.1 156.8 3,656.6
Total liabilities    786.7 1,615.0 163.8 288.2 91.9 2,945.6
Net assets    26.6 398.7 130.9 89.9 64.9 711.0
The non-Sterling denominated net assets of the Group may lead to a reported loss (depending on the mix relative to the 
liabilities), should Sterling strengthen against these currencies. Conversely, reported gains may arise should Sterling weaken.
The Group matches its currency position so holds net assets across a number of currencies. The Group takes into consideration 
the underlying currency of its required capital and invests its assets proportionately across these currencies so as to protect the 
solvency of the Group, and hence capital available for distribution to shareholders, against variation in foreign exchange rates. 
As a result, the Group holds a significant proportion of its assets in foreign currency investments.
In part, foreign currency forward contracts are used to achieve the desired exposure to each currency. From time to time the 
Group may also choose to utilise options on foreign currency derivatives to mitigate the risk of reported losses due to changes in 
foreign exchange rates. The degree to which options are used is dependent on the prevailing cost versus the perceived benefit 
to shareholder value from reducing the chance of a reported loss due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates. The details 
of all foreign currency derivatives contracts entered into are given in Note 24.
As a result of the accounting treatment for non-monetary items, the Group may also experience volatility in its income statement 
due to fluctuations in exchange rates. In accordance with IFRS, non-monetary items are recorded at original transaction rates 
and are not revalued at the reporting date. These items include unearned premiums, deferred acquisition costs and reinsurers’ 
share of unearned premiums. Consequently, a mismatch arises in the income statement between the amount of premium 
recognised at historical transaction rates, and the related claims that are valued using foreign exchange rates in force at the 
reporting date. The Group considers this to be a timing issue which can cause volatility in the income statement. NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

4.3.4 Other price risk
Introduction
This is the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of changes in market prices 
(other than those arising from interest rate risk or currency risk), whether those changes are caused by factors specific to the 
individual financial instrument or its issuer, or factors affecting all similar financial instruments traded in the market.
Financial assets and derivatives that are recognised at their fair value are susceptible to losses due to adverse changes in their 
prices. This is known as price risk.
Listed investments are recognised in the Financial Statements at quoted bid price. If the market for the investment is not 
considered to be active, then the Group establishes fair valuation techniques. This includes using recent arm’s length 
transactions, reference to current fair value of other similar investments, discounted cash flow models and other valuation 
techniques that are commonly used by market participants.
The prices of fixed and floating rate income securities are predominantly impacted by currency, interest rate and credit risks. 
Credit risk on investments is discussed in the following section of this Note.   Brit PLC Annual Report 2014 155
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
The Group invests a proportion of its assets in equities and hedge funds. These investments are limited within the investment 
guidelines to a diverse, small and manageable part of the Group investment portfolio.

Subject to taxation, the effect on shareholders’ equity would be the same as the effect on profit.
4.4 Credit risk
This is the risk that one party to a financial instrument will cause a financial loss for the other party by failing to discharge an 
obligation. The main sources of credit risk relate to:
• Reinsurers: through the failure to pay valid claims against a reinsurance contract held by the Group.
• Brokers and coverholders: where counterparties fail to pass on premiums or claims collected or paid on behalf of the Group.
• Investments, through the issuer default of all or part of the value of a financial instrument or the market value of that 
instrument.
• Cash and cash equivalents: through the default of the banks holding the cash and cash equivalents.
The insurance and non-insurance related counterparty credit risks are managed separately by the Group.
4.4.1 Investment credit risk
Investment credit risk management process
The Investment Committee chaired by the Group CEO is responsible for the management of investment credit risk. 
The investment guidelines and investment policy set out clear limits and controls around the level of investment credit risk. 
The Group has established concentration guidelines that restrict the exposure to any individual counterparty. The investment 
guidelines further limit the type, credit quality and maturity profile of both the Group’s cash and investments. In addition, the 
investment risk framework further limits potential exposure to credit risk through aggregate investment risk limits. NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

4.4.2 Insurance credit risk
Insurance credit risk management process
The Credit Committee chaired by the Chief Financial Officer and reporting to the Executive Management Committee, is 
responsible for the management of credit risk arising from insurance activities. Some responsibilities for reinsurance related 
credit decisions have been delegated to the Reinsurance Security Committee chaired by the Head of Group Financial 
Performance.
Reinsurer credit risk is managed by transacting only with reinsurance counterparties that satisfy a minimum level of financial 
strength or provide appropriate levels of collateral, and have been approved for use by the Reinsurance Security Committee. 
The reinsurer security list, which sets out the list of approved reinsurance counterparties, is reviewed at least annually and 
following any significant change in risk profile, which includes any changes to reinsurers’ financial ratings. Credit risk appetite 
limits are set for reinsurance entities and groups to limit accumulations of risk. These positions are monitored quarterly against 
current balance sheet exposures and in relation to a number of extreme loss scenarios.
Reinsurance aged debt is monitored and managed against tolerance limits set by the Board. A bad debt provision is held 
against all non-rated reinsurers or any reinsurer where there is deemed to be a specific risk of non-payment.
Any breaches of credit risk appetite are reported to the Risk Oversight Committee and the Board on at least a quarterly basis.

Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group may encounter difficulty in meeting obligations associated with financial liabilities that 
are settled by delivering cash or another financial asset. The predominant liquidity risk the Group faces is the daily calls on its 
available cash resources in respect of claims arising from insurance contracts.
The Group monitors the levels of cash and cash equivalents on a daily basis, ensuring adequate liquidity to meet the expected 
cash flow requirements due over the short-term.
The Group also limits the amount of investment in illiquid securities in line with the liquidity policy set by the Board. This 
involves ensuring sufficient liquidity to withstand claim scenarios at the extreme end of business plan projections, by reference to 
modelled realistic disaster scenarios. Contingent liquidity also exists in the form of a Group revolving credit facility.   Brit PLC Annual Report 2014 159

4 RISK MANAGEMENT POLICIES (continued)
4.6 Operational risk
Operational risk is the potential for loss arising from the failure of people, process or technology or the impact of external 
events. The nature of operational risk means that it is dispersed across all functional areas of Brit. Operational risk exposures are 
managed through a consistent set of management processes that drive risk identification, assessment, control and monitoring.
The Chief Operating Officer chairs the Operational Risk Working Group (ORWG) that provides a dedicated forum for managing 
operational risk in line with the operational risk policy and appetite limits set by the Board. This group reports to the EMC where 
it is augmented by operational risk owners within executive management who actively manage operational risk within their 
respective areas (such as underwriting, claims, investments and finance).
An operational risk management framework is in place to ensure an appropriate standard approach is taken to managing 
operational risk across the Group. The key elements of this framework are:
• Allocation of responsibility for the identification and assessment of operational risk. Standard tools are used to facilitate 
these assessments;
• Definition of standard elements of sound operating controls that are expected to be in place to address all  
identified operational risks;
• A process that integrates with Brit’s internal model to support the setting and monitoring of operational risk  
appetite and tolerances;
• Governance, reporting and escalation for operational risk;
• Infrastructure supporting the operational risk management framework; and
• Operational risk management training and awareness.
4.7 Capital management
The Group’s capital policy is to hold management capital at an entity level and surplus capital resources at both entity and 
Group level. Management capital is the capital required by each entity for current trading purposes based on our business 
strategy and regulatory requirements. The level of the surplus capital held at Group level is based on our risk appetite and 
provides flexibility, allowing the Group to deal with shock events and to take advantage of opportunities as they arise.
The capital policy is set by the Board and is based on the output of the internal model which reflects the risk profile of the 
business. The policy requires capital to be held well in excess of regulatory minimum requirements and underpins the Group’s 
statement of financial position strength. The policy ensures the capital adequacy of the Group, and each entity, through an 
efficient capital structure. The Group proactively responds to developments in the financial environment to ensure its capital 
strength is maintained while optimising risk-adjusted returns.
At Brit we seek to hold capital resources in a range of 120% to 140% of our requirement. We believe this is an appropriate level 
of capital for the business and provides management with:
• The flexibility to absorb major losses while still being in a position to take advantage of subsequent market dislocations;
• The ability to pursue opportunity-driven growth in our core business; and 
• The support to provide continuity in regular dividend payments to shareholders.   Brit PLC Annual Report 2014 161
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
The Group manages Adjusted net tangible assets, Subordinated debt, Letters of credit and Contingent funding as capital which 
amounted to £1,050.5m as at 31 December 2014 (31 December 2013: £909.4m). All external capital requirements have been 
complied with during the year by the Company as well as its individual insurance subsidiaries.
The Lloyd’s market is subject to the solvency and capital adequacy requirements of the Prudential Regulation Authority (PRA), as 
a result of which the Group may be adversely affected. The PRA may impose more stringent requirements on Lloyd’s which may 
result in higher capital requirements or a restriction on trading activities for entities within the Group. If Lloyd’s fails to satisfy its 
solvency test in any year, the PRA may require Lloyd’s to cease trading and/or its members to cease or reduce their underwriting 
exposure, which may result in a material adverse effect to the Group’s reputation, financial condition and results of operations.
Brit Global Specialty solely underwrites through the Group’s wholly-aligned Lloyd’s Syndicate 2987 which benefits from the 
Lloyd’s credit ratings of A (Excellent) from A.M. Best, AA – (Very Strong) from Fitch and A+ (Strong) from Standard & Poor’s. 
A downgrade in Lloyd’s financial strength ratings may have an adverse effect on the Group.
The Group’s business plan and underwriting capacity for the syndicate may be affected by a decrease in the value of the Group’s 
Funds at Lloyd’s or by recommendations from the Lloyd’s Franchise Board. The Group is also reliant upon the compliance of 
Lloyd’s with US regulations, including the maintenance by Lloyd’s of its trading licences and approvals in the US. NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

5 SEGMENTAL INFORMATION
This Note breaks down the operating results summarised in the income statement and the assets and liabilities in the statement 
of financial position into the main business areas of the Group. It also shows how our revenue is split globally. This analysis 
is designed to help you understand how each segment of our business has performed and how we have allocated our 
shareholders’ capital. 
As at 31 December 2014, the reportable segments identified were as follows:
• ‘Brit Global Specialty Direct’, which underwrites the Group’s international and US business, other than reinsurance. In the 
main, Brit Global Specialty Direct deals with wholesale buyers of insurance, rather than individuals. Risks are large and usually 
syndicated by several underwriters by means of the subscription market.
• ‘Brit Global Specialty Reinsurance’, which underwrites reinsurance business (essentially the insurance of insurance and 
reinsurance companies) and includes writing non-proportional cover for major events such as earthquakes or hurricanes. 
These insurance and reinsurance companies calculate how much risk they want to retain and then pass on their remaining 
exposure to reinsurers in return for a premium.
• ‘Other underwriting’, which comprises excess of loss reinsurance ceded from the strategic business units to a cell of Brit 
Insurance (Gibraltar) PCC Limited and life Syndicate 389.
• ‘Other corporate’, which is made up of residual income and expenditure not allocated to other segments.
Foreign exchange differences on non-monetary items are separately disclosed. This provides a fairer representation of the claims 
ratios and financial performance of the strategic business units (SBUs) which would otherwise be distorted by the mismatch 
arising from IFRSs whereby unearned premium, reinsurer’s share of unearned premium and deferred acquisition costs are treated 
as non-monetary items and the majority of other assets and liabilities are treated as monetary items. Non-monetary items are 
carried at historic exchange rates, while monetary items are translated at closing rates.
The Group investment return is managed centrally and an allocation is made to each of the strategic business units based 
on the average risk-free interest rate for the period being applied to the opening insurance funds of each strategic business 
unit. The annualised average risk-free rate applied to insurance funds was 1.5% for the year ended 31 December 2014 
(31 December 2013: 1.5%).
The ratios set out in the segmental analysis are calculated as follows:
• The claims ratio is calculated as claims incurred, net of reinsurance divided by earned premiums, net of reinsurance.
• The expense ratio is calculated as acquisition costs and other insurance-related expenses divided by earned premiums,  
net of reinsurance.
• The combined ratio is the sum of the claims and expense ratios.   Brit PLC Annual Report 2014 163

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
8 NET FOREIGN EXCHANGE GAINS/(LOSSES)
The Group operates in multiple countries and currencies and is exposed to gains and losses arising as a result of movement in 
various foreign currency exchange rates. This Note explains the foreign exchange gains or losses as a result of converting the 
income, expenses, assets and liabilities from foreign currencies to Sterling.
The Group recognised foreign exchange gains of £12.9m (31 December 2013: losses of £69.6m) in the income statement  
in the period.
Foreign exchange gains and losses result from the translation of the statement of financial position to closing exchange rates 
and the income statement to average exchange rates. However, as an exception to this, IAS 21 ‘The Effects of Changes in 
Foreign Exchange Rates’ requires that net unearned premiums and deferred acquisition costs (UPR/DAC), being non-monetary 
items, remain at historic exchange rates. This creates a foreign exchange mismatch, the financial effects of which are shown in 
the table below.

Earnings per share shows the profit for each share our shareholders own. We have also provided information to show the 
amount of net assets (both tangible assets and tangible and intangible assets combined) attributable to each share. 
The numbers of shares used for calculating the earnings per share and net assets per share are those of Brit PLC. The number of 
Achilles Holdings 1 S.à.r.l. shares in the comparative periods have been converted into the equivalent number of Brit PLC shares 
to reflect the corporate reorganisation on 28 March 2014. For further information refer to Note 2.

14 PROFIT ON DISPOSAL OF ASSET HELD FOR SALE
This Note sets out the details of and financial effect of the disposal of assets held for sale. It also gives an update on the 
contingent consideration receivable in respect of one of these disposals. 
Year ended 31 December 2014
On 20 May 2014, Avoca Loan Fund 1, a qualifying investment fund treated as a consolidated structured entity at 
31 December 2013 was categorised as an asset held for sale following a decision by management to dispose of this fund. 
The disposal was made in stages during the remainder of the year and all consideration received was equal to the fair value 
of the underlying assets.

Year ended 31 December 2013
On 10 August 2012, the Group entered into various contracts with the other owners of Verex Limited and Jardine Estates 
Limited. These contracts effectively converted £6.0m of Verex loan notes and accumulated interest previously held by the  
Group into 250,000 B shares and a put option whereby Jardine Estates Limited are required to buy the B shares for the higher 
of 10% of the aggregate value of Verex and £3.5m at any time after 10 August 2016. The contracts also committed the Group 
to sell its 35.3% of the ordinary share capital of Verex Limited at par to Jardine Estates Ltd. On 8 May 2013, following Financial 
Conduct Authority approval, the disposal was completed and the carrying value was transferred from asset held for sale to 
derivative contracts.
On 20 April 2013, the Group entered into a contract to dispose of its equity holding in Xbridge Limited to Intercede Limited. 
This disposal received the approval of the Financial Conduct Authority on 24 June 2013 and completed on 17 July 2013.

The range of the undiscounted contingent consideration receivable from the disposal of Xbridge Limited is £nil to £5.3m. 
The outcome will depend on the performance of Xbridge Limited during the three years commencing 1 January 2013 and 
on distributions and proceeds that the purchaser receives up to and including their ultimate exit from Xbridge Limited. The 
contingent consideration of £1.8m has been derived from a probability weighted model of possible outcomes on a discounted 
basis and had not been adjusted by 31 December 2014 except for the unwinding of the discount. NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

17 INTANGIBLE ASSETS
An intangible asset is an asset without any physical substance but which has long-term value to our business. Brit’s intangible 
assets relate to contracts to sell our products through independent brokers and agents (distribution channels) our brand names 
(trade names), our relationship with our customer base (renewal rights), our rights to underwrite policies at Lloyd’s (syndicate 
participations) and our internally developed software.
With the exception of our syndicate participation rights at Lloyd’s, which we classify as an indefinite life asset, we reduce 
the value of these assets according to their useful life by way of amortisation. Amortisation is included as an expense in the 
income statement. We also carry out our annual assessment of the carrying value of these assets and, if necessary, make an 
impairment charge to the income statement.

Additional information
The gross cost of software fully amortised but still in use is £6.1m (2013: £8.7m).
All software additions in 2014 and 2013 were internally developed.
The software amortisation charge for the year of £2.2m (2013: £2.3m) is included in the ‘other operating expenses’ line in the 
income statement.
There were impairments to intangible assets of £0.2m in 2013 which have been included in the other operating expenses’ line in

Impairment tests for syndicate participations
Syndicate participations are indefinite life intangible assets and are therefore reviewed annually for impairment. They have been 
allocated to cash-generating units (CGUs) as follows:
          31 December 31 December
          2014 2013
          £m £m
Global Specialty Direct        33.8 33.8
Global Specialty Reinsurance        11.6 11.6
          45.4 45.4
The recoverable amounts of the CGUs have been determined using a value in use calculation.
Each value in use calculation uses cash flow projections based on business plans approved by senior management covering  
a three year period and subsequent cash flows which assume a nil growth rate. These cash flows have been discounted  
using a risk-adjusted discount rate of 9.1% (2013: 8.7%). In each syndicate participation impairment review, the recoverable 
amount significantly exceeds the carrying value of the CGU including its associated syndicate participations, and it is  
considered that a reasonably possible change in key assumptions will not cause the carrying value of the CGU to exceed its 
recoverable amount.
The key assumptions used for the impairment calculations were that cash flows and profit levels will mainly depend on the level 
of premiums written by each strategic business unit, the rates at which these premiums are written and the claims activity on 
both prior and future underwriting years. The business plans reflect senior management’s best estimates based on historical 
experience, growth rates for the respective insurance industry sector, the insurance pricing cycle and expected results from 
ongoing and future strategic business unit product and distribution strategies.
Commissions and other insurance-related expenses are assumed to remain materially in line with current amounts relative to 
premium levels. NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Deferred tax has not been set up in respect of losses carried forward of £61.8m (2013: £60.3m) as it is not considered probable 
that they can be utilised in the foreseeable future.
Deferred tax has not been provided in respect of the profits of subsidiaries in the Group as tax exemptions, for example the 
participation exemption, are expected to apply.
Deferred tax assets arising on decelerated capital allowances of £11.1m (2013: £5.0m) have not been provided for due 
to uncertainty over the timing of their utilisation. NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

21 INSURANCE AND REINSURANCE CONTRACTS
This Note deals with balances carried in respect of insurance contracts (liabilities) and reinsurance contracts (assets). It examines 
the statement of financial position, splitting both insurance and reinsurance balances into their component parts, and explains 
the assumptions applied in arriving at these figures. The Note also shows how our claims have developed (before and after 
the effects of reinsurance) over a period of time by setting out the cumulative development at the end of each calendar year in 
respect of claims arising from business written in a particular underwriting year. It ends by analysing the movements in insurance 
and reinsurance contracts during the year.

Insurance contracts – assumptions and changes in assumptions
Process used to decide on assumptions required
The risks associated with these insurance liabilities are complex and subject to a number of variables that complicate 
quantitative analysis, particularly with casualty insurance liabilities.
The Group uses several statistical methods to incorporate the various assumptions made in order to estimate the ultimate costs 
of claims. The two methods more commonly used are the chain-ladder and the Bornhuetter-Ferguson methods.
Chain-ladder methods may be applied to premiums, paid claims or incurred claims (i.e. paid claims plus case estimates). The 
basic technique involves the analysis of historical claims development factors and the selection of estimated development 
factors based on these historical patterns. The selected development factors are then applied to cumulative claims data for each 
underwriting year that is not yet fully developed to produce an estimated ultimate claims cost for each underwriting year.
Chain-ladder techniques are most appropriate for mature classes of business that have a relatively stable development pattern. 
Chain-ladder techniques are less suitable in cases in which the insurer does not have a developed claims history for a particular 
class of business or for underwriting years at early stages of development where the outcome is still highly uncertain.   Brit PLC Annual Report 2014 179
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
The Bornhuetter-Ferguson method uses a combination of a benchmark or market-based estimate and an estimate based on 
claims experience. The former is based on a measure of exposure such as premiums; the latter is based on the paid or incurred 
claims to date. The two estimates are combined using a formula that gives more weight to the experience-based estimate 
as time passes. This technique is used in situations in which developed claims experience are not available for the projection 
(recent underwriting years or new classes of business).
The choice of selected results for each year of each class of business depends on an assessment of the technique that has 
been most appropriate to observed historical developments. In certain instances, this has meant that different techniques or 
combinations of techniques have been selected for the individual underwriting year or groups of underwriting years within the 
same class of business.
Standard statistical techniques may not be solely appropriate for assessing ultimate claims for a number of classes of business 
(e.g. Casualty Treaty) and particular events (e.g. natural catastrophes) and therefore alternative methodologies may be employed 
to add additional rigour to the process. Examples include reviewing potential exposure on a policy by policy basis and taking 
account of market intelligence to determine Brit’s share of the loss.
In addition to the estimation of claims reserves, certain estimates are produced for unearned premiums. For open market 
business, earned premium is calculated at policy level. However, premium derived from delegated underwriting authorities is 
calculated by applying the 1/144ths method to estimated premiums applied to the master policy. This assumes that attachments 
to master policies arise evenly throughout the period of that master policy.
Reinsurance outwards premiums are earned according to the nature of the cover. ‘Losses occurring during’ policies are earned 
evenly over the policy period. ‘Risks attaching’ policies are earned on the same basis as the inwards business being protected.
Changes in assumptions
The Group did not change its estimation techniques for the insurance contracts disclosed in this Note during the year.
Claims development tables
The tables below show the development of claims over a period of time on a gross and net of reinsurance basis.
The claims development tables have been presented on an underwriting year basis.
The tables show the cumulative incurred claims, including both notified and IBNR claims, for each successive underwriting year 
at the end of each year, together with cumulative paid claims at the end of the current year.
The claims have been adjusted to make them comparable on a year-by-year basis.
They have been grossed up to include 100% of the managed syndicate claims rather than the claims that reflects the Group 
percentage ownership of each syndicate’s capacity during the respective underwriting years. In addition, claims in currencies 
other than Sterling have been retranslated at 31 December 2014 exchange rates. NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

The percentages in the gross and net triangles are shown on an ultimate loss basis inclusive of catastrophe losses by year of 
account. The development patterns reflect our conservative reserving philosophy where positive development from the initial 
reserving position is slowly recognised as experience begins to emerge. 
The development of the 2007 and 2008 years of account was impacted by exposure to the financial crisis which resulted in 
reserving action which has subsequently led to stability in the ratios for a number of years. The 2010 year of account includes the 
impact of natural catastrophes occurring in 2011 which attached back to policies incepting in the 2010 year of account.
During 2014, the net aggregate reserve releases from prior years amounted to £32.1m, of which 87.9% was derived from the 
2011 and prior underwriting years (2013: £57.3m/88.5% from the 2010 and prior underwriting years). Reserves in Brit Global 
Specialty Direct and Brit Global Specialty Reinsurance experienced releases of £3.4m (2013: releases of £13.0m) and £29.2m 
(2013: releases of £45.3m) respectively with a strengthening of £0.5m (2013: strengthening of £1.0m) within Other Underwriting. NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

22 EMPLOYEE BENEFITS
This Note explains the pension schemes operated by the Group for its employees. For the Group’s defined benefit scheme (in 
which no further benefits are being accrued), it sets out the amount carried on the Group statement of financial position, gains 
and losses incurred during the year, amounts paid into the scheme, together with further information about the scheme. For the 
Group’s two defined contribution schemes, it sets out the costs incurred during the year.
(a) Brit Group Services Limited – Defined Benefit Pension Scheme
Through Brit Group Services Limited, the Group operates a funded defined benefit pension scheme providing pensions and 
death benefits to its members. The scheme closed to new entrants on 4 October 2001 and closed to future accrual of benefits 
on 31 December 2011. All active members of the defined benefit scheme joined the defined contribution plan for future service. 
Following closure to future accruals, benefits now increase broadly in line with inflation. The weighted average duration to 
payment of the scheme’s expected cash flows is 18 years (2013: 18 years).
The scheme is approved by HMRC for tax purposes, and is operated separately from the Group and managed by an 
independent Trustee. The Trustee is responsible for payment of the benefits and management of the plan’s assets. The scheme 
is subject to UK regulations overseen by the Pensions Regulator, which require the Group and Trustee to agree a funding 
strategy and contribution schedule for the scheme every three years. The most recent triennial review of the scheme was 
undertaken at 31 July 2012 and identified a funding deficit of £11.6m. The Group agreed to pay three contributions of £4.5m 
on each subsequent 31 July and a final contribution of £1.6m on 31 July 2016 to remove this deficit by 31 July 2016. The Group 
expects to contribute £4.5m to the scheme in 2015.
The Group has also committed to pay further contributions to the scheme of at least £2.0m a year from 1 January 2017 to 
31 July 2024, while the scheme remains in deficit when calculated on a ‘buyout’ basis. These contributions are payable by Brit 
Group Services Limited and backed-up by a cross-company guarantee from Brit Insurance Holdings Limited and Brit Overseas 
Holdings S.à.r.l.   Brit PLC Annual Report 2014 183

Investment strategy
The Trustee determines the scheme’s investment strategy after taking appropriate advice from its investment consultants. 
The management of the assets is delegated to State Street Global Advisors and Ruffer LLP . The Trustee’s investment objective 
is to ensure that the scheme has adequate resources to meet its liabilities and thereafter to maximise the long-term total rate 
of return on the assets. Investment risk is managed by diversifying the assets across asset classes whose return patterns are not 
highly correlated and by periodically rebalancing asset classes. The assets include a portfolio of UK index-linked government 
bonds which aim to match a significant part of the scheme’s inflation-linked benefits and therefore help to reduce the Group’s 
exposure to investment and inflation risks.

changes in assumptions could produce a different result.
Risks
The Group is exposed to a number of risks in relation to its defined benefit scheme, the most significant of which  
are detailed below:
Risk
Investment strategy  Changes in asset values are not matched by changes in the scheme’s defined benefit 
obligations. For example, if equity values fall with no changes in corporate bond yields,  
the net pension asset would reduce.
Investment returns  Future investment returns are lower than anticipated and so additional contributions are 
required from the Group to pay all the benefits promised.
Improvements in life expectancy  Scheme members live longer and so benefits are payable for longer than anticipated.
Inflation  Actual inflation is higher and so benefit payments are higher than anticipated.
Regulatory  In future the Scheme may have backdated claims or liabilities arising from future legislation, 
emerging practice or court judgments.
(b) Brit Group Services Limited – Defined Contribution Personal Pension Plan
Brit Group Services Limited operates a defined contribution group personal pension plan. The assets of the scheme are held 
separately from those of the Group in an independently administered fund.
The pension charge to the income statement represents contributions payable by Brit Group Services Limited to the fund and 
amounted to £4.6m (2013: £4.4m).
At 31 December 2014, no contributions were payable to the fund (2013: £nil).
(c) Brit Insurance Services USA Inc. – 401(k) Safe Harbor Plan
Brit Insurance Services USA Inc. operates a ‘401(k) Safe Harbor Plan’. The assets of the scheme are held separately from those  
of the Group in an independently administered fund.
The pension charge to the income statement represents contributions payable by Brit Insurance Services USA Inc. to the fund 
and amounted to £0.2m (2013: £0.3m).
At 31 December 2014, no contributions were payable to the fund (2013: £nil). NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Basis for determining the fair value hierarchy of financial instruments
The Group has classified the fair value measurements using a fair value hierarchy that reflects the significance of the inputs used 
in making those measurements. The fair value hierarchy comprises the following levels:
(a)  Level one – quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets;
(b)  Level two – inputs other than quoted prices included within level one that are observable for the asset, either directly  
(i.e. as prices) or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices); and
(c)  Level three – inputs for the assets that are not based on observable market data (unobservable inputs).
The level in the fair value hierarchy within which the fair value measurement is categorised in its entirety is determined on the 
basis of the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement. The significance of an input is assessed against 
the fair value measurement in its entirety.
Assets are categorised as level one where fair values are determined in whole directly by reference to an active market relate to 
prices which are readily and regularly available from an exchange, dealer, broker, industry group, pricing service or regulatory 
agency and those prices represent actual and regularly occurring market transactions on an arm’s length basis, i.e. the market 
is still active.
For assets and liabilities that are recognised at fair value on a recurring basis, the Group determines whether transfers have 
occurred between levels in the hierarchy by reassessing categorisation (based on the lowest level of input that is significant 
to the fair value measurement as a whole) at the end of each reporting period.   Brit PLC Annual Report 2014 187
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Fair values for level two and level three assets include:
• Values provided at the request of the Group by pricing services and which are not publicly available or values provided by 
external parties which are readily available but relate to assets for which the market is not always active; and
• Assets measured on the basis of valuation techniques including a varying degree of assumptions supported by market 
transactions and observable data.
For all assets not quoted in an active market or for which there is no active market, the availability of financial data can vary and 
is affected by a wide variety of factors, including the type of financial instrument, whether it is new and not yet established in the 
marketplace, and other characteristics specific to each transaction. To the extent that valuation is based on the models or inputs 
that are unobservable in the market, the determination of fair value requires additional judgement. Accordingly, the degree of 
judgement exercised is higher for instruments classified in level three and the classification between level two and level three 
depends highly on the proportion of assumptions used, supported by market transactions and observable data.
Valuation techniques
Level one
Assets included in level one are government bonds, treasury bills, exchange-traded equities and exchange-traded funds which 
are measured based on quoted prices.
Level two
Level two securities contain certain investments in US and non-US government agency securities, US and non-US Corporate 
debt securities, loan instruments, structured products (Asset Backed Securities (ABSs), Collateralised Mortgage Obligations 
(CMOs), Commercial Mortgage Backed Securities (CMBSs), Collateralised Loan Obligations (CLOs), Mortgage Backed Securities 
(MBSs) and Residential Mortgage Backed Securities (RMBSs)) and specialised investment funds.
US and non-US government agency securities are priced using valuations from independent pricing vendors who use discounted 
cash flow models supplemented with market and credit research to gather specific information. US and non-US corporate debt 
securities are investment grade and the information collected during pricing of these instruments includes credit data as well 
as other observations from the market and the particular sector. Prices for all these securities are based on a limited number of 
transactions so they are derived indirectly using inputs that can be corroborated by observable market data.
Level two loan instruments consist primarily of below investment-grade debt of a wide variety of corporate issuers and 
industries. These instruments are mostly over the counter (OTC) traded. These instruments are priced using pricing models 
whose inputs are derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data through correlation or other means for 
substantially the full term of the asset or liability.
Level two structured products include certain ABSs, CMOs, CMBSs, CLOs, MBSs and RMBSs. These structured products 
include pools of assets with a variety of underlying collateral. During pricing, the prepayment models might be adjusted for the 
underlying collateral and current price data, treasury curve, swap curve as well as the cash settlement.
Level two specialised investment funds contain alternative and credit opportunities funds that are valued based on the 
underlying assets in the fund on a security by security basis. A number of direct and indirect inputs such as benchmark yield 
curves, credit spreads, estimated default rates, anticipated market interest rate volatility, coupon rates and anticipated timing  
of principal repayments are considered during their valuation.
Level three
Level three securities contain certain investments in ABSs, CMOs, CMBSs and RMBSs as well as investments in Insurance-Linked 
Securities (ILS), loan instruments and specialised investment funds.
Level three ABSs, MBSs and CMBSs include debt securities backed by pools of loans with a variety of underlying collateral. 
These instruments are priced using unobservable inputs. NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
188 Brit PLC Annual Report 2014
23 FINANCIAL INVESTMENTS (continued)
Level three CMOs are non-agency mortgage backed securities that are valued using unobservable data at the time of valuation. 
Level three RMBSs include non-agency RMBS backed by non-conforming residential mortgages. Pricing models factor in interest 
rates, bond or credit swap spreads and volatility.
ILSs are financial instruments whose performance is primarily driven by insurance and/or reinsurance loss events. Instead of 
an active market, there is a secondary market existing for ILS contracts. Valuations of these securities require mark-to-market 
considerations when evaluating risk/return and pricing models use at least one significant input not being based on observable 
market data.
Level three loan instruments consist primarily of below investment-grade debt of a wide variety of corporate issuers and 
industries. These instruments are mostly over the counter (OTC) traded. These instruments are priced using unobservable inputs.
Level three specialised investment funds include securities that are valued using techniques appropriate to each specific 
investment. The valuation techniques include fair value by reference to Net Asset Values (NAVs) adjusted and issued by fund 
managers based on their knowledge of underlying investments and credit spreads of counterparties.

Fair values are classified as level one when the financial instrument or derivative is actively traded and a quoted price is available. 
In accordance with the Group’s policy if an instrument classified as level one subsequently ceases to be actively traded, it 
is immediately transferred out of level one. In such cases, instruments are classified into level two, unless the measurement 
of its fair value requires the use of significant unobservable inputs, in which case it is classified as level three. All fair value 
measurements above are recurring as they are required to be measured and recognised at the end of each reporting period.
All unrealised gains of £5.6m (31 December 2013: £4.1m) and realised gains of £12.7m (31 December 2013: £1.2m) on financial 
investments held during the period, are presented in investment return in the consolidated income statement.
Transfers from level one to level two
A total of £190.4m of funds were transferred from level one to level two during 2014 (2013: £nil). Additional information was 
obtained in 2014 from one fund manager relating to the underlying assets within their specialised investment funds which 
identified that the majority of the underlying assets were level two.    Brit PLC Annual Report 2014 189

Total Total net gains recognised in the income statement under ‘investment return’ in respect of level three financial investments 
for the period amounted to £2.9m (31 December 2013: £6.3m). Included in this balance are £0.7m of unrealised gains  
(31 December 2013: £0.9m) attributable to assets still held at the end of the year.
During the year ended 31 December 2014 the transfers of financial assets between fair value hierarchy level two and level three 
is as follows:
Transfers from level two to level three
A loan of £0.2m (2013:£nil) was transferred from level two to level three due to its inputs becoming unobservable during 2014.
Transfers from level three to level two
There were transfers amounting to £105.1m (2013:£nil), which comprised the following:

Other financial assets        3.2 –
          105.1 –
The availability of financial data for structured products such as ABSs, CMOs, RMBSs and CMBSs can vary and is affected 
by a wide variety of factors, including the type of financial instrument, whether it is established in the marketplace and other 
characteristics specific to each transaction. At the time the 2014 levelling exercise was performed, there was an increase in the 
availability of indirect observable market inputs (e.g. interest rates, yield curves, volatilities, prepayment speeds, credit risk, 
default rates) over those inputs available at the time of the 2013 levelling exercise. This increase in the availability of inputs was 
driven by an increase in trading of the instruments held by the Group or through an increase in trading of similar instruments.  
These factors, together with the pricing validation exercise conducted on a regular basis throughout 2014, has given 
management comfort and allowed it to reassess certain structured products as level two in the fair value hierarchy.
A total of £22.1m of funds were transferred from level three to level two during 2014 (2013: £nil). Additional information was 
obtained in 2014 from fund managers relating to the underlying assets within their specialised investment funds which identified 
that the majority of the underlying assets were level two. NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

In order to determine reasonably possible alternative assumptions, the Group adjusted key unobservable model inputs 
as follows:
• For debt securities, the Group adjusted, dependent on the type and valuation methodology of the investment, key variables 
including the probability of spread movements, leverage ratio changes and changes in mortgage default rates used in the 
models.
• For specialised investment funds, the assumptions have been adjusted by between 5% and 8% as determined by historic 
movements in volatility of valuations or price changes in the underlying investments.
24 DERIVATIVE CONTRACTS
This Note summarises the total value of the derivative contracts of the Group. It also explains how each derivative contract is 
categorised under three different levels of hierarchy, the valuation methods used to value derivative contracts and amounts 
transferred between levels. At 31 December 2014 and 31 December 2013, the options and interest rate swaps formed part of 
our investment management strategy, while the currency forwards formed part of our foreign exchange management strategy.

Valuation techniques
Level one
Futures contracts are ‘forward-based’ derivative contracts that are standardised, transferable and exchange-traded, and 
therefore quoted prices are available in an active market.
Level two
The fair value of the interest rate swaps are determined using pricing models based on observable market data such as prices of 
instruments with similar maturities and characteristics, interest rate yield curves and measures of interest rate volatility. The value 
is adjusted to reflect the credit risk of the counterparty.
The valuation technique used to determine the fair value of forward contracts is derived from observable inputs such as active 
foreign exchange and interest rate markets that may require adjustments for certain unobservable inputs.
Level three
The valuation technique to measure the fair value of put options is to use pricing models which require market-based inputs 
such as expected volatility, expected dividend yield and the risk-free rate of interest. NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

As at 31 December 2014, the fair value of the lower tier two subordinated debt was determined by reference to trading 
market values on recognised exchanges and was therefore categorised as a level one in the fair value hierarchy. As at 
31 December 2013, the fair value of the lower tier two subordinated debt was determined by reference to a portfolio of 
securities with similar characteristics with a discount applied to allow for illiquidity and was therefore categorised as a level two 
measurement in the fair value hierarchy. For further information relating to the fair value hierarchy, refer to Note 23.
Lower tier two subordinated debt
The lower tier two subordinated debt has a nominal value of £135.0m and interest is payable annually at a rate of 6.625%. It is 
listed and callable in whole by the Group on 9 December 2020 and following this date the interest rate resets to the higher of:
(i)  3.4% above the gross redemption yield of the 4.75% Treasury Gilt due 2030 quoted on the Reset Date; or
(ii)  3.4% above the gross redemption yield of the 8% Treasury Gilt due 2021 quoted on the Reset Date.
The effective interest rate method of accounting has been applied over the term up to the call date. NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Revolving credit facility
During 2014, the Group renegotiated its £225m revolving credit facility with its existing banking partners, with certain 
amendments taking effect on the date of the corporate reorganisation. The main changes were to reduce the margin from 3.0% 
to 2.3% and to extend the expiry date from 31 December 2017 to 31 December 2018.
At 31 December 2014, a US$80.0m (£51.3m) (2013: US$80.0m/£48.2m), letter of credit had been put in place under the facility 
while the remainder was undrawn. At 31 December 2014, the US$80.0m was fully collateralised (2013: uncollateralised).
28 PROVISIONS
A provision is recognised instead of an amount payable when there is uncertainty over the amount and timing of any future 
payment. The Group maintains two types of provisions, one related to leased properties which are currently unoccupied and 
one relating to dilapidation costs which we will have to pay when we vacate leasehold properties.

holding them.
At 31 December 2014, the number of own shares held in trust amounted to 829,913 (2013: 874,399 Brit PLC shares after 
reflecting the corporate reorganisation on 28 March 2014) with a value of £0.9m (2013: £1.6m). The purpose of the own shares is 
to satisfy awards under the share-based payment schemes.
33 RESERVES
This Note gives information about the reserves carried on the Group’s statement of financial position at 31 December 2013. 
Following the reorganisation in 2014, the balance at 31 December 2014 was nil.
The reserve balance of £94.4m at 31 December 2013 was a reserve of Achilles Holdings 1 S.à.r.l. which mainly resulted from 
a share cancellation made by that company during 2013. Following the corporate reorganisation on 28 March 2014 and the 
introduction of Brit PLC as the new ultimate holding company, the amount was no longer recognised in the consolidated 
statement of financial position.
34 COMMITMENTS
The Group has various financial commitments resulting from lease arrangements it has entered into. These amounts, which are 
not provided for on the consolidated statement of financial position, are set out in this Note.
Operating lease commitments
The Group has entered into a number of operating lease arrangements to lease properties and office equipment.
Property leases typically have rent reviews every five years where the lease payments could be increased to reflect market rates.
Operating lease payments recognised in the consolidated income statement during 2014 were £3.3m (2013: £3.1m).
The future minimum lease payments under non-cancellable operating leases were as follows:

36 NON‑CONTROLLING INTERESTS
During 2013 and 2014, the Group has bought out a number of minority shareholders who had interests in Group subsidiary 
companies. Following this, all of the Group’s subsidiary companies are now fully owned by the ultimate parent company, 
Brit PLC.
On 15 March 2013, the Group completed the buy-out of the non-controlling interests in Brit Insurance Holdings B.V . remaining 
from its acquisition on 9 March 2011. On 28 March 2014, as part of the corporate reorganisation, the Group exchanged the 
non-controlling shares in Achilles Holdings 2 S.à.r.l. for shares in Achilles Holdings 1 S.à.r.l. which in turn were exchanged for 
shares in Brit PLC. NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

(a) Retention Partnership Plan (RPP)
During 2011, selected employees in the senior management team were invited to buy a number of shares in Achilles Holdings 1 
S.à.r.l. under the RPP . For each share bought, the participant was granted five nil-cost options over shares in Achilles Holdings 1 
S.à.r.l.. As a result of the corporate reorganisation, the outstanding RPP awards were exercised with an effective date of  
28 March 2014.

(b)  Performance Share Plan (PSP)
During 2014 selected employees were awarded the right to acquire a defined number of Brit PLC shares at no cost to the 
employee. Subject to continued service and the satisfaction of the performance conditions, the right to acquire shares may be 
exercised in differing proportions with effect from the third, fourth and fifth anniversaries of the grant date. These proportions 
are 50%, 25% and 25% respectively.   Brit PLC Annual Report 2014 199
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
The performance conditions are:
• 75% of each award is subject to achieving specific targets for average annual Return on Net Tangible Assets (RoNTA) over  
a fixed three-year performance period; and
• 25% of each award is subject to the Group’s total shareholder return (TSR) achieving specific targets relative to a bespoke 
industry comparator group over a fixed three-year performance period.
Participants do not receive any dividends until after the shares have been received. A payment may be made at the time of 
vesting to reflect the dividend that would have accrued on vested shares between the date of grant and vesting.
The fair value of the PSP share awards with a TSR performance condition is calculated at the date of grant using a Monte Carlo 
simulation. This valuation process simulates the future TSRs for the Group and each stock in the comparator group over the 
three performance periods. The TSR for each stock is simulated by assuming a log-normal model of share returns. The inputs to 
that model are: the risk-free interest rate, expected future dividends, the expected volatility of share returns over the life of the 
awards and the historical correlation matrix of returns between companies. Expected dividends are deducted in the calculation 
of fair value because any dividends accrued over the vesting period are expected to be paid separately in cash.
The fair value of the PSP share awards with a RoNTA performance condition is equal to the share price on date of grant less the 
value of expected dividends in respect of the shares. The value of expected dividends is excluded because it is anticipated, as 
for the PSP awards with vesting based on TSR, that they will be paid separately in cash.
For PSP share awards granted during the year, the following key assumptions have been made:
        Year ended  Year ended
        31 December  31 December
        2014  2013
Risk-free interest rate (3-5 year terms)      1.3%  ‑1.8% pa  –
Expected volatility      22.0% pa  –
Expected dividend yield      7.7% pa  –
The risk-free rate is equal to the yields available on zero-coupon UK government bonds at the date of grant with terms equal to 
the expected lives of the awards. Expected volatility is based on the historic volatility of the Group’s share returns since the IPO 
and the historic volatility of the comparator group companies over periods commensurate with the expected term of the awards. 
The expected dividend yield is based on declared dividends and the Group’s dividend policy as at the date of grant and the 
share price on the date of grant.
The calculation of the compensation cost recognised in the income statement in respect of these awards assumes forfeitures 
due to employee turnover of 5% per annum prior to vesting, with subsequent adjustments to reflect actual experience.

37 SHARE‑BASED PAYMENTS (continued)
The weighted average remaining contractual life at the end of the year was 3.5 years.
(c)  Brit All‑Employee Share Plan
The Brit All-Employee Share Plan (comprising the Share Incentive Plan (SIP) for UK employees and the International Share 
Incentive Plan for overseas employees) provides for the award of Brit PLC Free Shares, Partnership Shares, Matching Shares and 
Dividend Shares. In 2014, Free Share awards were granted with a vesting period of three years from the Award Date. Vesting is 
unconditional for participants still in-service at the vesting date. Participants will also receive Dividend Shares which represent 
the value of reinvested dividends that would have accrued over the vesting period on the shares in the Free Share award. No 
Partnership or Matching shares had been awarded by 31 December 2014.
The fair value of the Brit All-Employee Share Plan awards is equal to the share price on date of grant. Dividends are not 
deducted in the calculation of fair value because dividends will be accumulated over the vesting period and repaid in equivalent 
dividend shares.
The calculation of the compensation cost recognised in the income statement in respect of these awards assumes forfeitures 
due to employee turnover of 10% per annum prior to vesting, with subsequent adjustments to reflect actual experience.

The weighted average fair value at date of grant for awards granted during 2014 was 239p.
The weighted average remaining contractual life at the end of the year was 2.5 years.
Employee share trusts and award settlement
Awards under the RPP were settled by the transfer of shares from an independent trust. New Brit PLC shares have been issued 
to an independent trust in order to settle awards as they vest under the Share Incentive Plan (SIP) for UK employees.
38 ACQUISITIONS
Acquisitions made by the Group in 2013 and 2014 are described below, including the nature of the acquisition, the cost of the 
acquisition and the accounting treatment adopted.
On 1 June 2014, the Group acquired an aviation underwriting and claims team from QBE Underwriting Limited. The Group 
purchased this team and the renewal rights to their London-based dedicated Lloyd’s aviation business through a cash payment 
of £1.2m and a further £0.9m of estimated contingent consideration. This has been recognised as a renewal right intangible 
asset of £2.1m.   Brit PLC Annual Report 2014 201
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
On 15 March 2013, the Group reached an agreement to acquire a portion of the formerly exclusive wholesale broker, Protected 
Self Insurance Manager from Risk Placement Services, Inc. The Group purchased this team and access to renewal rights through 
a cash payment of £0.3m. This has been recognised as a renewal right intangible asset.
The Group reached agreement on 1 May 2013 to acquire Maiden Specialty from Maiden Re Insurance Company. The Group 
purchased this team and access to renewal rights and certain items of office equipment through a cash payment of £0.9m and a 
further £0.4m of estimated contingent consideration. This has been recognised as a renewal right intangible asset of £1.2m and 
property, plant and equipment of £0.1m.
39 INTERESTS IN STRUCTURED ENTITIES
This Note defines a structured entity and sets out the Group’s interests in such vehicles and how we account for them.
A structured entity is defined as an entity that has been designed so that voting or similar rights are not the dominant factor in 
deciding who controls the entity, such as when any voting rights relate to administrative tasks only, or when the relevant activities 
are directed by means of contractual arrangements.
(a) Interests in consolidated structured entities
During 2013, the Group invested in a Qualifying Investment Fund (QIF), Avoca Loan Fund 1, which was a sub-fund of Avoca 
Capital Investments plc, the purpose of which was to invest in fixed income securities. By 31 December 2014, the Group had 
sold its investment in the sub-fund.
In determining whether the Group controlled the sub-fund, it considered how sub-fund investment decisions were made, voting 
or other rights and the design of the sub-fund. Based on these criteria, Avoca Loan Fund 1 was considered to be a consolidated 
structured entity.
The carrying value of the Group’s investment in Avoca Loan Fund 1 represented the Group’s maximum exposure to loss from 
the sub-fund and the Group provided no financial or other support to Avoca Loan Fund 1 during its ownership outside of any 
contractual arrangements in place.
(b) Interests in unconsolidated structured entities
As part of its investment activities, the Group has the following interests in unconsolidated structured entities:
          Year ended Year ended
          31 December 31 December
          2014 2013
          £m £m
Undertakings for Collective Investments in Transferable Securities     831.4 651.3
Mortgage-backed securities        128.5 85.4
Commercial Mortgage-backed securities        11.9 13.3
Other asset-backed structures        124.5 133.0
Total        1,096.3 883.0
These assets are included within the debt securities and specialised investment funds classification in Note 23 and form part of 
financial investments on the Group statement of financial position. They are carried at fair value.
The risk that the Group faces in respect of the investments in structured entities is similar to the risk it faces in respect of other 
financial investments held on the statement of financial position in that the fair value is determined by market supply and 
demand. This is in turn driven by investor evaluation of the credit risk of the structure and changes in the term structure of 
interest rates which might change investor expectation of the cash flows associated with the instrument and therefore its value in 
the market. NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
202 Brit PLC Annual Report 2014
39 INTERESTS IN STRUCTURED ENTITIES (continued)
The maximum exposure to loss in respect of these structured entities would be the carrying value of the instruments that the 
Group holds. Generally, default rates would have to increase substantially from their current level before the Group would suffer 
a loss and this assessment is made prior to investing and continually through the holding period for the security. The Group 
does not invest in securities which have a contingent liability to the borrowers or structures that provide any type of guarantee, 
revolving credit facility, callable loans or liquidity arrangement facilities to third parties such as overdrafts.
The Group has received investment returns from UCITS funds during 2014 amounting to £35.7m (2013: £11.2m) comprised of 
dividend income £19.0m (2013: £3.5m) and capital gains of £16.7m (2013: £7.7m). The Group has also received investment 
returns from structured products (mortgage backed securities, commercial mortgage backed securities and other asset backed 
securities) during 2014 amounting to £6.1m (2013: £5.9m) comprised of interest £5.0m (2013: £7.7m) and capital gains of £1.1m 
(2013: losses of £1.8m).
The Group has provided no financial or other support, other than through the normal purchase of tradable securities, to 
structured entities either held at the date of the statement of financial position or held during 2013 or 2014 and has no current 
intention to do so.

41 RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS (continued)
(ii) Loans
On 27 March 2014, certain key managers and certain other employees of the Group entered into loan agreements with Achilles 
Holdings 1 S.à.r.l., pursuant to which they borrowed £1.4m from Achilles Holdings 1 S.à.r.l. for the purpose of funding their 
acquisition of additional shares in Achilles Holdings 2 S.à.r.l., a Group company. The loans are interest free and are repayable in 
full on 28 February 2015 or, if earlier, the date on which the borrower ceases to be employed by a Group company. As part of 
the corporate reorganisation, the relevant shares in Achilles Holdings 2 S.à.r.l. were exchanged for shares in Achilles Holdings 
1 S.à.r.l., which in turn were exchanged for shares in Brit PLC. Each key manager and employee has been required to sell 25% 
of all of their shares in Brit PLC resulting from the corporate reorganisation and use 50% of the post-tax consideration for full or 
partial repayment of their respective loan. As at 31 December 2014, the total amount of such loans outstanding was £0.2m.
One of the loans referred to above was made to a Director, Mark Cloutier. The initial loan was £0.5m and the amount 
outstanding at 31 December 2014 was £0.2m.
(iii) Other transactions with Directors
Certain Directors are also directors of other companies as set out in the Governance section of this Annual Report. Some of 
these companies are their subsidiaries made with companies within the Brit Group. All such trading is carried out on arms-length 
commercial terms.
42 GUARANTEES AND CONTINGENT LIABILITIES
This Note explains guarantees issued by Group companies and any contingent liabilities they may be exposed to.
(a) Lloyd’s
Assets have been pledged, as Funds at Lloyd’ s, by way of deposits and fixed and floating charges for Brit UW Limited, the corporate 
member of the Group. As at 31 December 2014, the Funds at Lloyd’s requirement amounted to £490.9m (2013: £551.2m).
(b) Revolving credit facility
The Group has access to a £225.0m revolving credit facility. For further information, refer to Note 27. Guarantees have been 
made by Brit PLC and Brit Insurance Holdings Limited to the syndicated banks providing the facility.
As at 31 December 2014, a US$80m (£51.3m) letter of credit had been provided to Lloyd’s (2013: US$80.0m/£48.2m). 
At 31 December 2014, this letter of credit was fully collateralised with USD cash held in a charged bank account 
(31 December 2013: uncollateralised).
(c) Collateral pledged
As part of its reinsurance arrangements, a subsidiary company entered into a collateralised reinsurance arrangement with a 
counterparty and the fair value of the assets held to support this liability as at 31 December 2013 was £428.1m. The reinsurance 
arrangements ceased on 18 August 2014 and the collateral pledged was withdrawn on that date.
A Group company, Brit Syndicates Limited, has a letter of credit facility with Citibank PLC. Letters of credit to the value of US$14.6m 
(£9.3m) were in issuance at 31 December 2014 (31 December 2013: US$3.3m (£2.0m)) and were fully collateralised in cash.
(d) Taxation
The Group operates in a wide variety of jurisdictions around the world through its Lloyd’s syndicate and uncertainties therefore 
exist with respect to the interpretation of complex tax laws and practices of those territories. The Group establishes provisions 
for taxes other than current and deferred income taxes, based upon various factors which are continually evaluated, if there is 
a present obligation as a result of past events, it is probable that an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits will be 
required to settle the obligation, and a reliable estimate of the amount of the obligation can be made.
Income taxes are provided for as set out in accounting policy Note 2.5.10.   Brit PLC Annual Report 2014 205

NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL  
STATEMENTS
1 ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND BASIS OF PREPARATION
This Note provides details of the basis of preparation and accounting policies applied in producing these parent company 
Financial Statements.
1.1 Basis of preparation
The Company Financial Statements present the information about the Company as a separate entity. The Company was 
incorporated as a private limited company on 19 December 2013 and subsequently re-registered as a public company under the 
name Brit PLC on 3 March 2014. The Company was incorporated and registered in England and Wales with registration number 
8821629. The registered office of the Company is 55 Bishopsgate London EC2N 3AS. Brit PLC’s ordinary shares were admitted 
to trading on the London Stock Exchange on 2 April 2014.
These statutory accounts cover the period from 19 December 2013 to 31 December 2014 and have been prepared accordingly.
The Company has elected to prepare its Financial Statements in accordance with Financial Reporting Standard ‘FRS 102’, the 
Financial Reporting Standard applicable in the United Kingdom and Republic of Ireland and provisions of Section 396 of the 
Companies Act 2006. The Company has adopted FRS 102 early as permitted by the standard. 
No individual income statement is presented for the Company, as permitted by Section 408 of the Act. The loss dealt with in the 
accounts of the parent Company was £9.2m.
1.2 Accounting policies 
(a) Investments
Investments in subsidiary undertakings are stated at cost less provisions for any impairment.
(b) Income from fixed asset investments
Dividend income is recognised when the shareholders’ right to receive the payment is established.
(c) Long‑term debt
Long-term debt is recognised initially at transaction price which is the fair value. In accordance with Section 11 of FRS 102 Basic 
Financial Instruments, it is subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method, which is the future 
cash flows discounted at the effective interest rate.  
(d) Loans to group undertakings
Loans to group undertakings are recognised initially at transaction price which is the fair value, (including transaction costs 
incurred except in the initial measurement of financial liabilities that are measured at fair value through profit or loss) less 
amortised cost using the effective interest rate method, in accordance with Section 11 of FRS 102 Basic Financial Instruments.
Interest receivable is recognised using the effective rate interest method.
(e) Expenses
All expenses are accounted for on an accruals basis.
(f) Foreign currencies
The functional currency of the Company is Sterling which is the currency of the primary economic environment in which it 
operates.
Transactions in foreign currencies other than Sterling are converted at the rate of exchange ruling at the date the transaction 
is processed. Unless otherwise stated, transactions are converted at the average rates of exchange for the period. Assets and 
liabilities in currencies other than Sterling are converted at the rates of exchange ruling at 31 December of each year. Exchange 
differences arising on conversion are dealt with in the income statement. NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
212 Brit PLC Annual Report 2014
1 ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND BASIS OF PREPARATION  (continued)
(g) Deferred taxation
Deferred tax is recognised in respect of all timing differences which are differences between taxable profits and total 
comprehensive income that arise from the inclusion of income and expenses in tax assessments in periods different from those 
in which they are recognised in the Financial Statements, except that: 
• Provision is made for deferred tax that would arise on remittance of the retained earnings of overseas subsidiaries, associates 
and joint ventures only to the extent that, at the statement of financial position date, dividends have been accrued as 
receivable;
• Where there are differences between amounts that can be deducted for tax for assets (other than goodwill) and liabilities 
compared with the amounts that are recognised for those assets and liabilities in a business combination a deferred tax 
liability/(asset) shall be recognised. The amount attributed to goodwill is adjusted by the amount of the deferred tax 
recognised; and 
• Unrelieved tax losses and other deferred tax assets are recognised only to the extent that the directors consider that it 
probable that they will be recovered against the reversal of deferred tax liabilities or other future taxable profits. 
Deferred tax is measured on an undiscounted basis at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the periods in which timing 
differences reverse, based on tax rates and laws enacted or substantively enacted at the statement of financial position date.
(h) Share‑based payments
The fair value of equity instruments granted under share-based payment plans are recognised as an expense and spread over 
the vesting period of the instrument. The total amount to be expensed is determined by reference to the fair value of the awards 
made at the grant date, excluding the impact of any non-market vesting conditions. At the date of each statement of financial 
position, the Company revises its estimate of the number of equity instruments that are expected to become exercisable. It 
recognises the impact of the revision of original estimates, if any, in the income statement, and a corresponding adjustment 
is made to equity over the remaining vesting period. The fair value of the awards and ultimate expense are not adjusted on a 
change in market vesting conditions during the vesting period.
2 AUDITOR’S REMUNERATION

The audit fees of the Company have been borne by a related Group company and amounted to £10,000.

13 SHARE‑BASED PAYMENTS
The Company rewards its employees through various share-based incentive schemes. This Note explains the different schemes 
used to facilitate those share-based payments.
A number of long-term employee incentive schemes are settled with Brit PLC shares. These schemes are described below and 
further information is available in the Remuneration Committee Report.
The compensation cost under Section 3 of Financial Reporting Standard 103 in respect of these schemes is shown below:
          Period from

Brit All Employee Share plan         0.1
Cash-settled plans:
PSP dividend equivalents settled in cash         0.1
Total         0.4
The cost has been recognised in the financial statements of the subsidiary companies where the staff are employed.
(a) Performance Share Plan (PSP)
During 2014 selected employees were awarded the right to acquire a defined number of Brit PLC shares at no cost to the 
employee. Subject to continued service and the satisfaction of the performance conditions, the right to acquire shares may be 
exercised in differing proportions with effect from the third, fourth and fifth anniversaries of the grant date. These proportions 
are 50%, 25% and 25% respectively. 
The performance conditions are:
• 75% of each award is subject to achieving specific targets for average annual Return on Net Tangible Assets (RoNTA) over  
a fixed three-year performance period; and
• 25% of each award is subject to the Group’s total shareholder return (TSR) achieving specific targets relative to a bespoke 
industry comparator group over a three-year performance period.
Participants do not receive any dividends until after the shares have been received. A payment may be made at the time of 
vesting to reflect the dividend that would have accrued on vested shares between the date of grant and vesting.
The fair value of the PSP share awards with a TSR performance condition is calculated at the date of grant using a Monte Carlo 
simulation. This valuation process simulates the future TSRs for the Group and each stock in the comparator group over the 
three-year performance period. The TSR for each stock is simulated by assuming a log-normal model of share returns. The 
inputs to that model are: the risk-free interest rate, expected future dividends, the expected volatility of share returns over the 
life of the awards and the historical correlation matrix of returns between companies. Expected dividends are deducted in the 
calculation of fair value because any dividends accrued over the vesting period are expected to be paid separately in cash.
The fair value of the PSP share awards with a RoNTA performance condition is equal to the share price on date of grant less the 
value of expected dividends in respect of the shares. The value of expected dividends is excluded because it is anticipated, as 
for the PSP awards with vesting based on TSR, that they will be paid separately in cash.     Brit PLC Annual Report 2014 217
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
13 SHARE–BASED PAYMENTS (continued)
For PSP share awards granted during the year, the following key assumptions have been made:
          Period from
          19 December 2013 to 
          31 December 2014
Risk-free interest rate (3-5 year terms)        1.3% ‑1.8% pa
Expected volatility        22.0% pa
Expected dividend yield        7.7% pa
The risk-free rate is equal to the yields available on zero-coupon UK government bonds at the date of grant with terms equal to 
the expected lives of the awards. Expected volatility is based on the historic volatility of the Group’s share returns since the IPO 
and the historic volatility of the comparator group companies over periods commensurate with the expected term of the awards. 
The expected dividend yield is based on declared dividends and the Group’s dividend policy as at the date of grant divided by 
the share price on the date of grant.
The calculation of the compensation cost recognised in the income statement in respect of these awards assumes forfeitures 
due to employee turnover of 5% per annum prior to vesting, with subsequent adjustments to reflect actual experience.
Reconciliation of movement in the number of PSP awards

Outstanding at 31 December        2,596,365
There were no awards exercisable at the end of the year.
The weighted average fair value at date of grant for equity-settled awards granted during 2014 was 158p.
The weighted average remaining contractual life at the end of the year was 3.7 years.
(b)  Brit All‑Employee Share Plan
The Brit All-Employee Share Plan (comprising the Share Incentive Plan (SIP) for UK employees and the International Share 
Incentive Plan for overseas employees) provides for the award of Free Shares, Partnership Shares, Matching Shares and 
Dividend Shares. In 2014, Free Share awards were granted with a vesting period of three years from the Award Date. Vesting 
is unconditional for participants still in-service at the vesting date. Participants will receive further shares (Dividend Shares) 
representing the value of reinvested dividends that would have accrued over the vesting period on the shares in the Free 
Share award.
The fair value of the Brit All-Employee Share Plan awards is equal to the share price on date of grant. Dividends are not 
deducted in the calculation of fair value because it is assumed that any dividends will be accumulated over the vesting period 
and repaid in equivalent shares.
The calculation of the compensation cost recognised in the income statement in respect of these awards assumes forfeitures 
due to employee turnover of 10% per annum prior to vesting, with subsequent adjustments to reflect actual experience. NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

14 SUBSEQUENT EVENTS
This Note explains any events which have occurred between the date to which these statements are prepared 
(31 December 2014) and to the date of this report (24 February 2015). Such events can be categorised as adjusting or  
non-adjusting depending on whether the condition existed in 2014. If non-adjusting events after the year end are material,  
non-disclosure could influence the economic decisions that users make on the basis of the Financial Statements. Therefore,  
in this section we disclose details of any material non-adjusting events after the reporting period.
On 17 February 2015, the boards of Fairfax Financial Holdings Limited (Fairfax) and the Company announced that they had 
reached agreement regarding the terms of a recommended cash offer through which the entire issued and to be issued ordinary 
share capital of the Company would be acquired by FFHL Group Ltd, an entity wholly–owned by Fairfax.  
Under the terms of this offer, shareholders of the Company would be entitled to receive 305 pence in cash for each Brit share, 
comprising 280 pence in cash and 25 pence by way of the 2014 final ordinary and special dividends recommended by the Board 
of the Company.   COMPANY INFORMATION

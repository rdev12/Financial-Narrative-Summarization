elcome to Essar Energy’s  
first annual report as a publicly 
listed company. Despite listing in 
volatile market conditions against 
a backdrop of a challenging global 
economic and financial environment, 
we are pleased to report that your 
Company has performed well. At 
the end of 2010 our share price had 
risen 38.1% from the listing price of 
420 pence, compared with a rise of 
6.2% for the FTSE 100 over the same 
period – a creditable performance.
The global economic outlook is 
improving even though the recovery in 
the developed world remains fragile. 
India however, continues to stand apart, 
along with other emerging economies, 
and deliver solid growth due to its 
high domestic consumption demand. 
As demand in India grows, so will its 
energy needs and we are creating 
energy assets that are critical to the 
economic development of India. We 
believe that the fundamentals driving 
Indian growth are robust and as a result, 
it is clear that the long term outlook 
for Essar Energy remains strong. 
Government projections indicate that 
the Indian economy is set to grow at 
over 8% this financial year. All policies 
of the Government rest on the premise 
that the domestic economy will see a 
high demand for goods and services 
as India modernises and industrialises 
further. While there is some concern 
regarding inflation, the Indian Chief 
Economic Advisor recently made a 
statement that food inflation will come 
down to 7% from the present 10%. 
Most macroeconomic analysts continue 
to believe the India growth story is 
intact and the only possible threat is an 
uncontrolled increase in global oil prices.
strategy
Our strategy is clear; to create a 
world-class, low-cost, integrated 
energy company focused on India 
and positioned to capitalise on India’s 
rapidly growing energy demand. While 
the focus is on India, Essar Energy will 
also pursue opportunities overseas 
which support our strategy and deliver 
value to our shareholders. To deliver 
our strategy we will; optimise the 
performance of all our existing assets; 
deliver growth through a variety of 
green-field and brown-field power and 
oil and gas projects; leverage our skills 
and Indian asset base to identify further 
growth opportunities; and, act as a 
good corporate citizen with respect to 
the health and safety of our employees, 
the communities in which we operate, 
and the environment. The delivery 
against this strategy will provide a more 
predictable business performance 
over time which in turn, underpins the 
creation of value for our shareholders, 
customers, employees and, importantly, 
the communities around our operations. 
We are happy to inform you that during 
the year, your Chief Executive, Naresh 
Nayyar, and his team have successfully 
focused on delivering in line with 
the above stated strategy. This has 
resulted in a strong production and cost 
performance as well as progress on our 
significant pipeline of growth projects.
We are also happy to share that as 
a part of seeking opportunities in 
c hairman and vice c hairman’s statement
“We are creating 
energy assets 
that are critical 
to the economic 
development 
of India.”

overseas markets, we announced an 
exclusivity agreement with Shell UK 
Limited in February 2011 in relation to 
an offer for the proposed purchase of 
the oil refinery and other associated 
assets at Stanlow, near Ellesmere Port, 
Cheshire, for a cash consideration of 
US$350 million. The acquisition of the 
high complexity Stanlow refinery, which 
is the second largest refinery in the UK, 
will give Essar Energy direct access 
to the UK market, is aligned with the 
Company’s strategy to provide options 
for the export of refined products 
from the Vadinar refinery in India, and 
is being acquired at a competitive 
price when compared to other recent 
comparable refinery transactions. 
The acquisition will be conditional on, 
amongst other items, the approval 
of Essar Energy’s shareholders at a 
general meeting and is expected to be 
completed in the second half of 2011. 
While we continue to deliver well against 
our plans, we are seeing some delays 
in certain regulatory approvals that 
could impact the financial and operating 
performance of the Company. However, 
timely receipt of approvals is a key risk 
for all companies operating in India, 
and other developing economies. 
More details on some of these items 
are given in the Principal Risks and 
Uncertainties section of this report. 
While the health and safety 
performance at our operational plants 
was satisfactory, our overall progress 
in this critical area can be further 
improved. 2010 was declared as the 
Year of Safety and during this period 
the Vadinar refinery achieved more 
than 1,000 days and over 18 million 
man hours without a lost time incident. 
While the Board is pleased with these 
results at our operating plants, our 
progress in the area of health and 
safety, in particular, remains a focus at 
both our construction and operating 
sites, and we remain committed to 
improving our performance in this area. 
board governance
Essar Energy’s Board is committed 
to the highest standards of corporate 
governance and advancing the interests 
of all shareholders equally. The Directors 
of Essar Energy were all appointed 
ahead of our Listing on 7 May 2010. 
The Board is comprised of four 
independent directors and three 
non-independent directors, including 
your Chief Executive who is the 
sole Executive Director. The Board 
is committed to having a majority 
of independent directors who will 
bring relevant knowledge and 
experience to the Company. 
In line with the principles of the 
Combined Code, the Board has 
established an Audit Committee, 
a Remuneration Committee, a 
Nominations and Governance 
Committee, a Health, Safety and 
Environment Committee and the first 
report on these Committees is provided 
in the Corporate Governance report.
people
One thing that always impresses us is 
the quality of the people throughout 
Essar. Our strategy is built upon 
creating world class assets, but our 
results will be a function of the quality 
of the people constructing, operating 
and managing these assets.
Naresh Nayyar is a talented and 
experienced Chief Executive and he 
has developed a strong and diverse 
team with a depth of talent to support 
him. On your behalf, the Board would 
like to thank Naresh and everyone 
involved with our Company for the 
contribution they have made in making 
our first year as a ‘plc’ so successful.

2010 
was a year that presented 
a mix of challenges 
and achievements. Despite ongoing 
uncertainty across the global economy, 
Essar Energy, with its focus on 
India, was able to deliver a strong 
operating and financial performance.
f inancial results
Our continuing focus on the stated 
strategy has resulted in a profit before 
tax for the year of US$365.5 million 
and operating cash flow of US$652.7 
million. We remain on track to have in 
place 11,470 MW of power generation 
capacity by the end of 2014, subject 
to securing fuel for the projects under 
development, and to upgrade our 
refinery to 20 million tonnes per annum 
capacity with a complexity of 11.8 by 
September 2012. This is in line with 
the plans that we announced at the 
time of our initial public offering. 
o perations
Across the portfolio we saw a 
strong operating performance with 
good availability from our power 
plants and another year of record 
production from our Vadinar refinery.
Despite strong power plant availability, 
our generation was lower than 
planned due to high rainfall during 
the monsoon season and high gas 
prices. However, the financial impact 
of this lower generation is largely 
mitigated by the structure of our power 
purchase agreements where payments 
are primarily based on availability. In 
October, the first unit of our 380 MW, 
Vadinar P1 gas fired power plant 
synchronised with the grid, the first to 
do so since our Listing in May 2010.
The Vadinar refinery continues to 
perform well and set records for 
production and throughput in each 
quarter of the year. Total throughput 
for the year was 14.7 million tonnes of 
crude, well above the refinery’s name 
plate capacity of 10.5 million tonnes 
per annum. In total, we processed 
20 different crudes during the year 
including Mangala, our first domestic 
crude, being delivered through a 
590km heated pipeline from Rajasthan, 
which is in the north of India.
June saw the de-regulation of gasoline 
prices in India which enabled us to 
compete on a level playing field with 
the public sector retailers. The result 
was an increase in the sales and 
profitability of gasoline from our near 
1,400 retail fuel outlets across India. 
Despite this, increasing oil prices 
have pushed up the price of gasoil, 
delaying the government’s plans to 
de-regulate gasoil which accounts 
for around 80% of our retail sales. 
We continue to plan for 1,700 retail 
fuel outlets across India by April 2011, 
but are likely to slow down our plans 
beyond this time until the path to the 
de-regulation of gasoil becomes clear.
Growth projects
We continue to execute well against our 
significant pipeline of growth projects. 
In total we invested US$2,957 .9 
million across our power and oil 
and gas projects during the year.
In Power, we are currently investing 
in ten power projects and one 
transmission project with a combined 
capital cost of US$2,856.2 million. 
Six of these projects were under 
construction at the time of the IPO, 
but proceeds from the Listing have 
facilitated the movement of four 
projects with a combined capacity

execute well against 
our significant pipeline

of 3,570 MW from the development 
to the construction phase.
2011 is a critical year for our power 
business as 2,910 MW of new capacity 
is planned to enter commercial 
operations during the year. This new 
capacity will significantly increase 
the cash flow and profitability of the 
business and remove the construction 
risk from these projects. One 
downside risk continues to be the 
delay in receipt of forest approvals 
for coal mines which is holding up 
our captive mine development.
In our Exploration and Production 
business, we are extremely pleased 
with progress at our Raniganj Coal 
Bed Methane project. At the end of 
the year we had drilled 49 production 
wells with 19 producing gas. As each 
new well is drilled, our knowledge of 
the field improves and we are confident 
of reaching our peak production of 
3.5 mmscm/day by 2014. However 
progress on the production sharing 
contract for our Ratna/R Series field 
has been slower than expected.
In Refining, the phase 1 of our Vadinar 
expansion is progressing well and 
is more than 84% complete as of 
end February 2011. We expect the 
expansion to reach mechanical 
completion by the middle of 2011 and 
enter commercial production during the 
second half of 2011. The importance 
of this expansion is the increase in 
complexity from 6.1 to 11.8. This will 
allow us to process a higher proportion 
of heavy and ultra-heavy crudes and 
produce more high value products. 
We expect this to result in an increase 
in the profitability of the refinery.
During the year we also identified 
an opportunity to further increase 
the capacity of the refinery to 20 
mmtpa at a very competitive capital 
cost. This optimisation project has 
already commenced and is on track 
to complete by September 2012. Post 
our expansion, Essar Energy will be in 
a situation where it will need to export 
a higher proportion of high value 
products in the short to medium term, 
particularly gasoline and gasoil. The 
natural markets for these products are 
Europe and the US and, in line with 
this, we announced in February an 
offer to purchase the Stanlow refinery 
in the UK for US$350 million. The 
European refining industry is facing 
a number of challenges as existing 
facilities age and need to be upgraded 
to meet new fuel specifications. Given 
Stanlow’s scale and high complexity, 
we believe that Stanlow will be a 
survivor in this market and under the 
right ownership it will thrive and prosper. 
We believe that Stanlow will be a 
valuable addition to the Essar Energy 
portfolio and that this acquisition is 
fully aligned with our stated strategy.
Health and safety
A true measure of success is enabling 
our employees to operate in a healthy 
and safe working environment. I 
am pleased with the way that our 
employees have embraced our values in 
this area and our performance has been 
recognised externally with the award for 
the Vadinar refinery of the Gujarat Safety 
Council’s winner’s shield for the lowest 
disability injury index in 2009. Also, the 
Vadinar refinery and the Bhander Power 
plant at Hazira have received Integrated 
Management systems certifications 
from the British Standards Institution 
after earning both ISO9001/14001 
and OHSAS 18001 certification. 
Unfortunately, the performance at our 
under construction projects has been 
below expectations and is an area of 
particular focus for improvement. The 
health and safety of our employees and 
the communities where we operate 
is a priority for our Company and is 
important to me personally as well as 
the whole senior management team.
Looking forward, our Company has a 
clear strategy for creating value, using 
prudent decision making and focused 
on the Indian energy growth story. At 
Essar Energy, we have had a good 
first year and I hope to build on our 
achievements to deliver our full potential.

essar energy at a glance
2010 saw the creation 
of Essar Energy as the 
holding company for the 
Essar Group’s power and 
oil and gas interests. 
Essar Energy was listed on the 
main market of the London Stock 
Exchange through an initial public 
offering which raised US$1.9 billion 
gross proceeds (US$1.8 billion 
net proceeds) and at that time 
was the largest primary offering in 
the London market since 2007 . 
Subsequent to the Listing, Essar 
Energy entered the FTSE 100 on 
21 June 2010. Essar Energy also 
entered the MSCI UK index on 30 
November 2010 and on 1 December 
2010, Futures and options contracts 
were made available for trading 
on LIFFE CONNECT
®
 and within 
Bclear. These events have created 
additional interest in the shares of 
Essar Energy and we have seen 
an increase in the liquidity of the 
Company’s shares since Listing.
The Company’s strategy is clear; 
to create a world-class, low cost 
Indian energy company, positioned 
to capitalise on India’s rapidly 
growing energy demand. While the 
focus is on India, Essar Energy will 
also pursue opportunities overseas 
which support our strategy and 
deliver value to its shareholders.

Essar Energy’s refining business primarily 
consists of the Vadinar refinery, the 
second largest private sector refinery 
in India, a 50% interest in the Kenya 
Petroleum Refinery Limited and 1,385 
retail fuel outlets across India.
The Vadinar refinery in Gujarat processed a record 14.7 mmtpa 
of crude oil in 2010. Construction is now under way to 
extend the refinery’s throughput capacity to 20 mmtpa by 
September 2012. This expansion will increase the complexity 
from the current 6. 1 to 1 1.8, allowing the refinery to process 
a higher proportion of heavy and ultra-heavy crudes and 
produce a higher proportion of middle and light distillates. 
Subject to market conditions, the refinery has the potential to 
be further expanded to 38 mmtpa. Post this expansion, the 
refinery will have a complexity of 12.8 and will be able to refine 
all varieties of crude and produce Euro V grade fuels, making 
it one of the largest single-location refineries in the world. 
Essar Energy also holds a 50% interest in Kenya Petroleum 
Refineries Ltd, Mombassa, a tolling refinery with a current 
throughput of 1.6 mmtpa.
Essar Energy serves retail customers in India through a

market overview continued
economic outlook
India has seen a swift and solid 
economic recovery over the last 
year, contrasting positively with many 
developed economies. GDP growth 
is on track to be 8.6% for the fiscal 
year 2010-11, one of the highest rates 
among the world’s major economies. 
With nominal GDP forecast at US$1.73 
trillion, India will make the transition 
from a low income country to a middle 
income country as per capita income 
crosses US$1,200. High inflation, 
double-digit for food, remains a concern 
as it erodes real income. This risk to 
growth remains a priority for the Indian 
Government as can be seen from the 
RBI’s continued monetary tightening 
through increases in interest rates.
High rates of growth however, are 
improving the fiscal position of the 
economy and it is anticipated that 
the fiscal deficit will be better than 
the target of 5.5% for this year. This 
will give the Indian Government more 
scope to spend, with an expected 
focus on welfare and infrastructure. In 
the most recent budget, infrastructure 
spending was increased by 23% 
in 2011-12 to US$48 billion. This 
should offset any dampening of 
investment from higher interest rates.
Increasing economic growth is 
positively impacting India’s energy 
demand growth. Energy usage is 
both broadening in the economy 
and deepening as income levels 
rise. This will result in increased 
levels of energy intensity.
It is estimated that India’s total primary 
energy consumption will grow by 39% 
in the 10 year period from 1995 to 2015 
and increase a further 55% by 2035 
(International Energy Outlook, 2010 – 
US Energy Information Authority). This 
increasing trend of energy consumption 
supports our strategy to focus on the 
energy demand growth in India.
business outlook
The second half of 2010 saw heavy 
rains during the monsoon season 
in India reducing peak power 
requirements in the country. November 
2010 saw a reduction in demand 
and merchant power prices fell as 
State Electricity Boards reduced their 
power requirements to avoid paying 
high prices in the merchant market. 
January 2011 saw a sharp rebound in 
merchant prices due to an increase in 
demand as a result of state elections 
and an increase in the penalties 
payable by the State Electricity Boards 
for reducing system frequency.
Despite this short term volatility, the 
fundamental drivers of power demand 
remain robust; increased economic 
activity across both the retail and 
industrial sectors. The supply of new 
capacity has been unable to keep 
up with demand, meaning that India 
continues to experience large and 
consistent power deficits which are 
set to continue for the foreseeable 
future. This lack of reliable power 
supply, particularly to industry, will 
have a negative impact on growth.
High raw material and energy costs, 
particularly gas and coal, will continue 
to put upward pressure on long term 
power prices. This is of particular 
concern given India’s reliance on 
imported coal and gas for power. 
The use of domestic resources has 
the potential to reduce these risks, 
but progress on the development of 
domestic resources remains slow.
The Government of India has put in 
place a regulatory environment to 
encourage private sector participation 
in the power generation sector, 
but still the process of receiving 
regulatory approvals and delays to the 
access of fuel supplies means that 
progress is slower than expected. 
The current five year plan has forecast 
growth in generation capacity of 
150 GW over the plan period, but 
this target looks challenging. Essar Energy plc Annual report + accounts 2010
23
company overview business review Governance financial statements
Petroleum product demand in India 
continues to demonstrate strong 
growth supported by growth in the 
Indian economy, increases in per capita 
income, growth in vehicle ownership 
and the focus on infrastructure 
spending. India will remain the anchor 
market for Essar Energy’s expanded 
refinery capacity albeit that export 
sales in the medium term are likely 
to increase to around 40% of sales 
due to new capacity additions by the 
public sector refiners. The planned 
acquisition of the Stanlow refinery in 
the UK will increase the sales options 
available for the export of high value 
products produced from Vadinar.
Deregulation of gasoline prices in 
India in June 2010 increased the 
competitiveness of our retail fuel 
outlets. However, increasing oil prices 
with a resultant impact on gasoil 
prices has adversely impacted the 
Government of India’s roadmap 
toward gasoil deregulation. 
A rebound in global demand in 2010 
had a clear impact on oil prices. Current 
events in the Middle East and North 
Africa have the potential to impact oil 
supplies putting further pressure on 
prices. This is of particular concern for 
India which imports around 80-85% 
of its crude oil needs. This situation is 
expected to continue despite significant 
discoveries of both oil and gas in India 
in recent years. The Company has 11 
of its 17 oil and gas and CBM blocks 
located in India and given the domestic 
demand scenario, commercialisation 
of these assets represents a significant 
opportunity for Essar Energy.

o ur strategy and performance
stated strategy performance
 Optimise  
performance of all  
existing assets
Essar Energy intends to capitalise on 
the existing assets by drawing on the 
Essar Group’s significant experience 
and expertise to carry out a number of 
optimisation projects that will consolidate 
Essar Energy’s position as one of 
India’s largest energy groups. This will 
be achieved through a combination of 
debottlenecking operating plants, further 
improving efficiency, expanding output 
and increasing economies of scale.
2010 has seen a record operating performance from the power 
plants as well as the Vadinar refinery. Operationally, all plants 
have performed well with availability between 94% and 99% 
and 2010 has seen an 8.5% increase in overall generation over 
2009. The Vadinar refinery witnessed a record throughput of 
14.7 mmtpa in 2010 and a 57% increase in CP GRM in 2010.
Deliver growth  
through a variety of  
power and oil and  
gas projects
Essar Energy plans to pursue further 
growth through both green-field and 
brown-field energy projects in the areas 
of exploration and production, refining, 
marketing, power generation, raw material 
acquisition, transmission and distribution.
Unit #1 of the Vadinar P1 380 MW gas fired power station 
synchronised with the grid in October 2010, the first one to do 
so since our IPO. Essar Energy also moved four of its power 
projects into the construction phase taking the capacity under 
construction to 8,070 MW. The Refinery Phase 1 expansion is 
now more than 84% complete as of end February 2011 and 
the expansion of the refining capacity to 20 mmtpa is expected 
by September 2012, at a very competitive capital cost.
Leverage skills and  
Indian asset base  
to identify growth 
opportunities
Essar Energy intends to leverage its 
established skills and Indian asset

Essar Energy acquired coal mines in Indonesia and Mozambique 
in 2010 comprising 100 mmt of mineable reserves. These 
mines are currently progressing through the approval process 
and will supply coal to the upcoming power plants of Essar 
Energy. In June 2010, Essar Energy was declared the winner 
of four CBM exploration blocks, which will give Essar Energy 
additional in place prospective resources of over 7 .6 tcf 
of CBM gas. In July 2010, Essar Energy announced the 
acquisition of Navabharat Power Pvt. Limited, a company 
setting up a 2,250 MW coal fired power station in Orissa, India, 
including allocation of the Rampia coal block of 112 mmt. In 
November 2010, Essar Energy announced a project to further 
enhance the capacity of the Vadinar refinery by 2 mmtpa to 
take the total capacity to 20 mmtpa by September 2012.
Be a good

Essar Energy will continue to act as a 
good corporate citizen with respect to 
the health and safety of its employees 
and the communities in which it 
operates. The maintenance of high 
environmental performance standards 
are significant responsibilities within the 
conduct of Essar Energy’s operations 
and the aim of the Company is to be 
recognised as a leader in health, safety 
and environmental management.
Essar Energy’s strong focus on health, safety and environment 
has been instrumental in the Vadinar refinery completing 1,000 
days of refinery operations without any lost-time incident, 
thus achieving over 18 million man hours without a lost time 
incident as of 31 December 2010. The Refinery also received 
the Gujarat Safety’s winner shield for the Lowest Disability 
Injury Index in 2009, thus reinforcing Essar Energy’s focus on 
health and safety. The Vadinar refinery and the Bhander Power 
plant at Hazira have received Integrated Management Systems 
(‘IMS’) certification from the British Standards Institution after 
earning both ISO9001/14001 and OHSAS 18001 certification. Essar Energy plc Annual report + accounts 2010

stated strategy performance
 Optimise  
performance of all  
existing assets
Essar Energy intends to capitalise on 
the existing assets by drawing on the 
Essar Group’s significant experience 
and expertise to carry out a number of 
optimisation projects that will consolidate 
Essar Energy’s position as one of 
India’s largest energy groups. This will 
be achieved through a combination of 
debottlenecking operating plants, further 
improving efficiency, expanding output 
and increasing economies of scale.
2010 has seen a record operating performance from the power 
plants as well as the Vadinar refinery. Operationally, all plants 
have performed well with availability between 94% and 99% 
and 2010 has seen an 8.5% increase in overall generation over 
2009. The Vadinar refinery witnessed a record throughput of 
14.7 mmtpa in 2010 and a 57% increase in CP GRM in 2010.
Deliver growth  
through a variety of  
power and oil and  
gas projects
Essar Energy plans to pursue further 
growth through both green-field and 
brown-field energy projects in the areas 
of exploration and production, refining, 
marketing, power generation, raw material 
acquisition, transmission and distribution.
Unit #1 of the Vadinar P1 380 MW gas fired power station 
synchronised with the grid in October 2010, the first one to do 
so since our IPO. Essar Energy also moved four of its power 
projects into the construction phase taking the capacity under 
construction to 8,070 MW. The Refinery Phase 1 expansion is 
now more than 84% complete as of end February 2011 and 
the expansion of the refining capacity to 20 mmtpa is expected 
by September 2012, at a very competitive capital cost.
Leverage skills and  
Indian asset base

power Generation and Transmission
O 
perationally, all plants performed 
well with availability between 
94% and 99%. Overall generation 
was 8.5% higher than 2009, but 
lower than planned due to heavy 
rains during the monsoon season in 
India, which affected domestic and 
agricultural power demand, as well 
as the impact of higher gas prices.
In October 2010, the first unit of the 
380 MW Vadinar P1 gas fired power 
station was synchronised with the grid. 
The second unit’s synchronisation was 
delayed to January 2011 due to a faulty 
starter motor that had to be sent back 
to the manufacturers for repair. Dispatch 
from this plant is expected to remain 
low until the Vadinar phase 1 refinery 
expansion is complete, when demand 
for power and steam should increase. 
In addition to completing the Vadinar 
P1 power station, the Company 
continued to make significant progress 
with its other power projects and in 
November 2010 moved four power 
plants with a combined capacity 
of 3,570 MW into the construction 
phase. We now have 8,070 MW of 
capacity under construction with 
2,910 MW due to enter commercial 
operations during 2011. 
Whilst there are some delays to the 
projects scheduled to come in to 
operation in 2011, primarily due to heavy 
rains during the monsoon season in 
India, subject to securing fuel for the 
projects under development, we remain 
on track to have 11,470 MW of operating 
power capacity by the end of 2014.
In India, we are still awaiting forest 
clearance for our Mahan, Chakla and 
Ashok Karkata coal blocks which 
will provide fuel for the Mahan I and 
Tori power stations. This clearance is 
delaying the development of a number 
of coal blocks in India and as a result, 
an Empowered Group of Ministers 
was formed by the Prime Minister’s 
Office to resolve all cases where 
significant progress has been made 
on construction of the power plant. 
Despite a visit to our sites in July 2010 
and a favourable recommendation, we 
have not yet received forest clearance. 
While we are optimistic of a favourable 
outcome, we will not be in a position 
to supply coal from our own mines 
ahead of the commissioning of the 
1,200 MW Mahan I coal fired power 
project. The first unit of this power 
plant will commence commissioning 
in September 2011. We have therefore 
applied to Coal India Limited for 
tapering coal linkage until our own 
mines are operating at full capacity. We 
expect to receive this clearance shortly. 
In July 2010, Essar Power Limited 
entered into an agreement for the 
acquisition of a 100% interest in 
Navabharat Power Pvt. Limited 
(‘Navabharat Power’) for a consideration 
of US$50.2 million. Navabharat Power 
is a 2,250 MW coal-fuelled power 
plant being set up in Orissa, India and 
is being implemented in two phases; 
phase one of 1,050 MW and phase 
two of 1,200 MW. The total estimated 
capital cost is US$2 billion. The project 
includes the allocation of the Rampia 
coal block of 112 mmt and a 4.7 mmtpa 
coal linkage with Coal India Limited. 
Phase I of the project progressed to the 
construction phase in November 2010.
2011 is a critical year as we expect 
2,910 MW of installed capacity to 
enter commercial operations from 
our Salaya I, Mahan I and Vadinar P2 
power stations. This new capacity 
will increase the cash flow and 
profitability of the business and also 
take Essar Energy closer to its target 
of 11,470 MW by the end of 2014. 
c oal
Essar Energy has 450 mmt of coal 
reserves in coal mines across India as 
well as Indonesia and Mozambique. In 
India, Essar Energy has four domestic 
coal blocks with coal reserves of 
350 mmt: the Mahan coal block 
in Madhya Pradesh, the Chakla 
and Ashok Karkata coal blocks in 
Jharkhand and the Rampia coal 
block in Orissa. Essar Energy also has 
coal reserves of 64 mmt in Indonesia 
and 35 mmt in Mozambique.
The acquisition of the Aries coal mine 
in Indonesia, comprising 64 mmt of 
mineable reserves, was completed 
in April 2010. The mine will provide 
fuel for the Salaya I power station 
and is currently progressing through 
its approval process ahead of the 
commencement of mining. First 
production is expected in the fourth 
quarter of 2011. In the interim, the 
Salaya I power project will have the 
benefit of its contract with Essar 
Shipping to source coal at a landed 
price of US$55/tonne. Commissioning 
of the first unit of the Salaya I plant 
is due to commence in May 2011.
During the period Essar Power 
also purchased a coal resource 
of approximately 35 mmt in 
Mozambique from an Essar affiliated 
company. Total consideration for 
both mines was US$148 million.
Currently, Essar Energy does not 
have any operating coal mines as it 
is awaiting the final forest clearance 
allowing mining to proceed but is 
optimistic of a favourable outcome. In 
the meantime Essar Energy has applied 
for temporary coal supplies to ensure 
coal availability for the plants and is 
hopeful of receiving these in time.

l imited domestic supply 
of power generation 
equipment is a key 
reason for delays in 
indian power projects. 
Essar Energy has addressed 
this problem by modularising 
the design, engineering and 
construction of its power 
projects using a sister 
company, Essar Projects, as 
the engineering, procurement 
and construction contractor 
and building strong 
relationships with major 
overseas equipment suppliers.
This approach has allowed 
Essar Energy to reduce 
design and construction 
costs, optimise delivery 
timelines and lower 
operating and maintenance 
costs against peers. 
Essar Energy recently received 
an appreciation letter from

o il and Gas Exploration and Production
Largest CBM acreage  
in India
E 
ssar Energy has one producing 
oil field, the CB-ON/3, Mehsana 
field in Gujarat. Total production for 
the year was 9,616 barrels, up from 
2,974 barrels in the prior year.
During 2010, the Company was 
awarded four exploration blocks under 
the Government of India’s CBM-IV 
bid round. The four blocks comprise 
2,233 sq.km of exploration acreage 
with in-place prospective resources of 
over 7 .6 tcf of CBM gas, according to 
documents issued by the Directorate 
General of Hydrocarbons at the time 
of bidding. These blocks, together 
with existing CBM block at Raniganj, 
West Bengal, make Essar Energy the 
Company with the largest CBM acreage 
in India and over 10 tcf of reserves and 
resources. The Company has signed 
the CBM contracts for these blocks 
and is in the process of obtaining 
appropriate licences, including the 
Petroleum Exploration Licences. The 
Company is also planning the initial 
work programme for these blocks.
Raniganj in West Bengal, our first 
CBM block under development, has 
made significant progress during the 
year. Currently 19 wells are producing 
about 30,000 scm/d of gas and an 
additional 30 production wells have 
been drilled. To accelerate our work 
programme we have ten drilling rigs 
of various capacities operating at site 
and one hydrofracturing unit. To date, 
201 bcf of gas has been classified in 
the 2C, contingent resource category 
with another 792 bcf classified as a 
best estimate prospective resource. 
14 wells are currently being drilled with 
a view to migrate more resources to 
the 2C, contingent resource category 
during the second half of 2011.
In December 2010, the Company 
signed an agreement to farm out 
a 37% participating interest in the 
OPL 226 oil and gas block offshore 
Nigeria to Agamore Energy Limited, 
a local Nigerian Company. This 
block was awarded to Essar in 
the 2007 Nigerian bid round and a

Drilling wells at a low cost 
while maintaining well 
integrity is a challenge 
for cbm developments.
Essar Energy has come up 
with an innovative solution 
where two types of rigs are 
used to drill wells. Conventional 
water drilling rigs are used 
initially to depths down to 
the coal formations and then 
subsequently the target depth 
is reached using air drilling rigs.
This practice has various 
benefits such as reduced 
formation damage, faster 
penetration rates and 
reduced drilling costs.
Further, Essar Energy has 
deployed an innovative 
technique for extracting 
gas from the coal seams by 
using a coil tubing unit for 
hydrofracturing. This technology 
allows for multiple coal seams 
to be hydrofractured at a 
time, compared to just one 
coal seam for conventional 
hydrofracturing, thereby 
reducing the time required 
for well completion. Essar Energy plc Annual report + accounts 2010

Operating review
Oil and Gas Refining and Marketing
Record refinery  
throughput
O 
perationally, the Vadinar refinery 
in Gujarat continues to operate 
well above its nameplate capacity 
of 10.5 mmtpa, processing a record 
14.7 mmt of crude oil (107 .2 mmbbl) 
during 2010, 11.3% higher than the 
13.2 mmt of crude oil (96.3 mmbbl) 
processed during 2009. This produced 
a CP GRM
1
, inclusive of sales tax 
benefit, of US$6.6 per barrel for the 
period, which was a 57% improvement 
compared with a CP GRM in 2009 
of US$4.2 per barrel. In June 2010, 
the refinery received its first Mangala 
crude through a dedicated heated and 
insulated pipeline from the oil fields in 
Rajasthan. This low sulphur, heavy and 
high pour crude is an important new 
source of crude for Essar Energy as 
it improves crude oil supply security 
and benefits from lower logistics costs 
and taxes. Exports from the Vadinar 
refinery increased to 31% in 2010 
compared to 23% in 2009. This was 
primarily due to an increase in export 
sales of fuel oil caused by increasing 
displacement of fuel oil in India with gas.
Essar Energy operates, through a 
franchise model, 1,385 retail fuel outlets 
across India selling gasoline and gasoil 
under the Essar brand with a further 
250 under construction. In June 2010, 
the Government of India announced 
plans to fully deregulate retail prices of 
gasoline and to gradually deregulate 
gasoil prices over time. This decision 
supported our plans to increase our 
retail fuel outlets to 1,700 by April 2011, 
which remains on track. However, an 
increasing oil price has put pressure 
on the market price of gasoil, which 
in turn has caused the uncertainty 
regarding Government of India’s plans 
to deregulate retail prices of gasoil. 
As a result, Essar Energy intends to 
slow down its plans to increase retail 
outlets beyond this number until there 
is further clarity on gasoil deregulation. 
Additionally, the Company is increasing 
non-fuel retailing activities in its current 
portfolio of retail outlets to provide 
an additional source of revenue.
The phase 1 refinery expansion 
is scheduled to reach mechanical 
completion mid 2011. This will be 
preceded by a 35 day shut down 
during May/June 2011 to allow for the 
tie-in of the new units and for routine 
maintenance. Ramp up of the new 
units will commence in Q3 2011, 
with the majority of the increased 
production expected from mid Q4 2011. 
Completion of the phase 1 refinery 
expansion will increase production to 
375,000 barrels per stream day from 
300,000 barrels per stream day and 
more importantly, increase complexity 
from 6.1 to 11.8. The increased 
complexity means that the refinery can 
increase the proportion of heavy and 
ultra-heavy crude that it processes 
through the refinery and produce a 
higher proportion of middle and light 
distillates. We expect this to result in a 
positive improvement in GRMs. While 
the construction costs of the Phase 1 
refinery project are within the overall 
budget including the contingency 
utilisation relating to change of scope, 
costs are estimated to increase by 
approximately US$111.6 million, 6.6% of 
the original project cost. This increase 
is mainly due to expected delay in 
commissioning and related interest 
costs and pre-operative expenditures. 
In November 2010, the Company 
announced plans to further increase 
the capacity of the refinery to 20 
mmtpa, or 405,000 barrels per stream 
day. This will be achieved through 
optimisation of some of the refinery 
units at an estimated cost of Rs. 17 
billion (c. US$379 million); the project 
will be completed by September 
2012. The move follows a detailed 
project review that identified several 
opportunities to de-bottleneck the 
refinery and revamp some of the units at 
an extremely competitive capital cost.

With the addition of four crude 
blending facilities, the refinery 
has been able to effectively 
blend various varieties of crude 
in small quantities to saturate 
all sections of the mother

and operations are built around a 
culture of responsible behaviour 
by all our employees, which in turn 
reflects everything we do as we seek 
to create value for our stakeholders.
This applies to the way in which we 
deal with colleagues internally just as 
much as those outside the business 
with whom we come into contact or on 
whom our business has an impact.
Building and operating large scale 
power, oil and gas assets represents 
a challenge. However, our aim is to 
ensure that as far as possible the 
impact on people, on the communities 
in which we operate and on the 
environment is positive, and that any 
risks and consequences from our 
operations are minimised. Within 
this, a key imperative is a concern 
with people’s health and safety.
We are continually seeking to 
benchmark against best practice, 
to embrace change and to improve 
our performance. This report is 
intended to summarise our approach, 
policies and performance across the 
key areas of health and safety, the 
environment and our communities. 
Health and safety
Essar Energy’s business revolves 
around constructing and operating 
very large assets carrying oil, refined 
products, natural gas, high voltage 
electricity and coal. These are potentially 
hazardous by their nature and it is 
therefore critical that we take all steps 
possible to protect our employees and 
others in the vicinity of these assets. 
Such a focus on health and safety 
must be built into the culture of our 
employees from the top downwards, 
thus ensuring that potential problems 
can be dealt with proactively before 
they occur. Indeed, 2010 was 
declared Year of Safety by the Essar 
Group Chairman Shashi Ruia and 
Safety Champions were nominated 
across the business to promote 
the safety message, along with the 
introduction of various safety awards. 
To prevent recurrence of accidents 
during construction activities, ongoing 
measures are being taken to identify 
key areas of risk and ensure that 
appropriate steps are taken with 
staff and contractors to minimise 
accidents and reinforce the need 
for a safe working environment. 
The measures undertaken include; 
carrying out competency assessments 
for contractors carrying out safety 
critical jobs, checking contractor 
equipment for fitness, enhanced 
supervision of contractors work, 
carrying out safety training and briefings 
to contract workers and regular 
safety meetings and discussions.

Essar Energy is determined to continue 
its focus on minimising environmental 
impacts from the construction and 
operation of its assets. Although this is a 
major challenge, it is also an opportunity 
to show how we can make a difference. 
We have achieved ISO 14001 standard 
for some of our sites and our Bhander 
Power plant at Hazira has received 
ISO 14001:2004 certification. There 
is an ongoing focus on ensuring 
that in future all of our other sites are 
also certified to ISO 14001:2004.
The following Essar Energy Sites have 
received the ISO 14001 certification:
Essar Energy Holdings Ltd; ¸ ¸
Essar Oil Ltd., (Vadinar refinery); ¸ ¸
Essar Power Holdings Ltd; and ¸ ¸
Essar Power Hazira Ltd. ¸ ¸
The ISO 14001 certification for Bhander 
Power Ltd is currently in process.
In 2011, one priority is to step up our 
response to climate change. As a key 
player in the energy sector, we know 
that our approach to tackling global 
warming will be important to our 
business competitiveness in the future. 
We are currently going through a carbon 
emissions accounting process at our 
Vadinar refinery, the associated power 
station and other operations on site – 
including indirect and fugitive emissions. 
We will in due course prepare a carbon 
management action plan. We will also 
be fully briefing employees on the 
importance of tackling climate change.

October 2010. The total number of 
CERs for this project are expected 
to be around 257 ,000 per year.
In addition to the above, our refinery 
at Vadinar has also participated in the 
Clean Development Mechanism global 
programme. Various recent technical 
inputs have led to further opportunities 
to reduce carbon emissions being 
identified and these are currently being 
progressed as projects with the aim of 
securing registration with the UNFCCC.
Given the large requirement for water 
as part of our energy production and 
refining processes, our management 
of water resources is critical to the 
environment in which we operate. 
We have taken considerable steps 
to reduce water usage and have 
also started collecting rain water. 
As a result of this, in 2010, none of 
the water sources near our plants 
were significantly affected by the 
withdrawal of water for industrial use.
c ommunity
Essar Energy has a strong focus 
on the developmental needs and 
aspirations of communities near 
its sites. All of our corporate social 
responsibility activities and projects, 
and those of the wider Essar Group, 
are managed through the Essar Family 
Foundation. The EFF focuses on 
education, health, entrepreneurship, 
infrastructure, women’s empowerment, 
child welfare, environment and 
community care. It particularly 
concentrates on families who have 
contributed their land and other 
resources to facilitate development 
of our plants and employees 
who live in surrounding areas.
education
At Vadinar, the Shri. NK Ruia Madhyamik 
Vidalaya School, which was founded 
by Essar in 1993 in Lonavala, has seen 
a huge increase in student enrolment. 
This school, which started with 
six students, now has 177 .
Essar also contributes towards 
upgrading and refurbishing other 
schools in the region around Vadinar, 
for example providing new classrooms, 
new toilet blocks and new computers. 
Particularly able students are given 
financial support to allow them to 
pursue further education. Other 
support includes the organisation 
of English and Computer Studies 
classes in some village schools.
Assistance with vocational training for 
adults and older students has also 
been provided in some locations. 
Near Essar’s Mahan power plant 
site in Madhya Pradesh, a computer 
training centre has been established, 
allowing some successful students to 
find jobs. Others have been provided 
with training as electricians, plumbers, 
welders and fitters at the Industrial 
Training Institute in Pachore. There 
are also adult literacy classes which 
are conducted regularly at Vadinar.
Health
A medical centre has been provided 
by Essar at Nagwa village, near its 
Mahan site. This centre provides free 
medicines, medical checkups and 
ambulance services to villagers.
In 2007 , Essar established a Community 
Health Centre in Jankhar village, near 
Vadinar. This facility treated 30,873 
patients in 2010, with the doctors 
on call including a paediatrician, a 
gynaecologist and an ear, nose and 
throat specialist. There is also an 
ambulance and paramedics available. 
This centre is of particular importance 
given that the other two nearest health 
centres or hospitals are 20km and 
40km away. An associated mobile 
clinic treated a further 19,108 patients 
in 2010, and a mother and child 
care centre treated 1,425 patients.
infrastructure
Essar Energy is actively involved in 
providing infrastructure improvements 
in the villages surrounding its facilities. 
Initiatives include repairing roads, 
particularly during the rainy season 
when roads can quickly erode, 
laying of water supply pipelines 
and associated sump and pump 
house facilities in some villages.
people
Essar Energy views its employees as 
its biggest asset and is therefore highly 
focused on developing people right 
across the business. Essar Energy 
employs over 2,300 people, primarily 
in India and these employees come 
from diverse backgrounds but every 
effort is made to ensure they are 
treated fairly and with respect and given 
equality of opportunity to progress. 
One priority has been to upgrade 
our processes around recruiting 
talent externally and managing talent 
internally to ensure we have the required 
capability as the business grows 
rapidly. This has involved introducing 
more robust recruitment processes, 
with more of the activity conducted 
in-house. In particular, we have a 
series of programmes designed to 
train and develop young professionals 
entering the organisation. We have also 
declared 2011 as the year of Internal 
Talent Management, underlining our 
commitment to identify and develop 
the high potential employees we 
already have. This includes a strong 
focus on succession planning.
Our people priorities for 2011 include 
further building Essar Energy’s 
reputation as an ‘Employer of Choice’ 
which people aspire to work for. This 
is being done partly through improving 
relationships with our people through 
higher levels of engagement, with an 
emphasis on elements including quality 
of life, opportunities and total rewards. 
We are also improving our management 
and motivation of people, helped by 
linkage of reward with business results.

At the Vadinar refinery, we 
supply approximately 24 
million litres of water per year 
to the surrounding villages, 
which is brought in by tankers. 
There were 16,500 tanker 
loads supplied to 12 villages 
in 2010, compared with 
6,544 the previous year. 
We have also developed 
watersheds, deepened village 
ponds and diverted two 
small rivulets to these ponds, 
resulting in village bore wells 
being extremely well supplied. 
We now intend to build a water 
purification plant to supply 
these villages with 20,000 litres

r evenue – Group
Essar Energy revenue increased by US$2,981.8 million over 2010, reflecting a 42% growth year on year, primarily driven by 
increased refined product prices and record refinery throughput and production. Additionally, a full year of operations at the 
Algoma power plant, commissioned in June 2009, has helped increase power revenues. 
r evenue – power
Power revenues improved by US$56.7 million from US$265.1 million in 2009 to US$321.8 million in 2010. This 21% increase was 
primarily as a result of a full year of operation of our Algoma power plant, Canada. Additional revenues were also generated from 
sales under an ABT, a frequency based pricing mechanism, as well as increased recovery of fixed charges in Bhander under the 
related power purchase agreement. The ABT mechanism is an energy policy adopted in India (ABT Order dated January 2000 
issued by the Central Electricity Regulatory Commission) based on pricing bulk power across various stakeholders which is 
designed to bring about more responsibility and accountability in power generation and consumption through a scheme of 
incentives to regulate generation and usage of power across the grid.

Despite strong power plant availability, our generation, whilst overall improved from 2009, was lower than planned due to heavy 
rains during the monsoon season in India which affected both domestic and agricultural demand. However, the structure of our 
power purchase agreements means that the impact of this lower generation on earnings is largely mitigated as payments are 
primarily based on availability, except those in respect of the Hazira power purchase agreement with Gujarat Urja Vikas Nigam 
Limited which are derived on an off-take basis.

r evenue – exploration and production
Production of 9,616 bbls from the CB-ON/3 Mehsana field, Gujarat, contributed US$0.6 million of revenue in the year to 
31 December 2010. A further US$2.6 million was earned by providing Exploration and Production related manpower service  
to other Essar affiliated companies. 
r evenue – r efining and marketing
Refining and Marketing revenues increased by US$2,921.9 million, representing a 43% growth, from US$6,758.7 million in 2009 
to US$9,680.6 million in 2010, primarily as a result of the following:
increased refinery product sale prices of US$2,057 .9 million with average price of US$647/mt during 2010 against US$498/mt ¸ ¸
in 2009;
improved sales quantity of refinery products contributing further revenues of US$733.5 million with 13.8 mmt of petroleum ¸ ¸
product sold in 2010 representing a 12% increase against 12.3 mmt sold in 2009;
rise of average selling price of traded products from US$798/mt in 2009 to US$1,039/mt in 2010 resulting in US$79.9 million ¸ ¸
increase in revenues;
crude oil trading revenue of US$120.5 million over 2010 which were not undertaken in 2009; ¸ ¸
US$72.3 million increase in sales tax benefit mainly due to increase in selling prices and higher quantity of products sold as ¸ ¸
compared to the prior year; and 
US$138.1 million reduction in revenues due to a 34% reduction in the quantity of traded products sold. ¸ ¸
During 2010, the Vadinar refinery processed 14.7 mmt of crude oil against 13.2 mmt in 2009. 2010 recorded the highest yearly 
throughput, with the crude distillation unit operating at 140% of its nameplate capacity. All other refinery units operated well 
beyond their name plate capacity. Furthermore, fuel and loss, which is a measure of effectiveness of energy utilisation and loss 
control by refineries worldwide, improved in 2010 at 5.8% against 6.2% in 2009. In general, fuel and loss indicates how much 
fuel we have used for each ton of crude processed. It is measured as a percentage of crude processed and natural gas 
consumed. Lower fuel and loss indicates higher energy efficiency and better control of losses which in turn positively impacts 
refinery margins. The Company believes its fuel and loss is one of the lowest amongst Indian refineries.

with Gujarat State Petroleum Corporation Limited, Gas Authority of India Limited and Sabarmati Gas Limited for setting up 
compressed natural gas facilities in Essar Oil retail fuel outlets across India. Together with higher production, we had sales of 
13.8 mmt in 2010 against 12.3 mmt in 2009. In 2010, we further consolidated our position in bitumen, having sold 537 .8 kt

Essar Energy’s overall EBITDA increased by US$55.2 million representing a growth of 8% year on year. The business drivers 
behind EBITDA are set out in the following section. 
ebit Da – power 
Power’s EBITDA for 2010 increased by US$57 .3 million to US$213.5 million from US$156.2 million in 2009, an increase of 37%. 
This was primarily due to a full year’s operation of the Algoma power plant, sales under ABT and increased fixed charges in 
Bhander Power under the terms of the power purchase agreement. Essar Energy plc Annual report + accounts 2010
40
ebit Da – exploration and production
Exploration and Production achieved an EBITDA of US$1.1 million in 2010 compared to US$8.0 million loss in 2009 mainly as  
a result of a reduction in foreign exchange losses as well as revenues derived from the provision of manpower services to other 
Essar affiliated companies. 
ebit Da – r efining and marketing 
Refining and Marketing EBITDA for 2010 decreased by US$0.8 million to US$514.7 million from US$515.5 million in 2009.  
This was primarily due to improvements in the GRM year on year by US$161.0 million, offset by an increase of US$17 .5 million  
in operating costs, a decrease in traded margin of US$30.0 million, lower foreign exchange gains in 2010 of US$96.0 million  
and increase in product handling charges of US$14.7 million due to an increase in quantities sold. 
r efining and marketing cp ebit Da and cp G rm
For further understanding of our Refining and Marketing operations we also present its EBITDA on an adjusted internal measure 
using the CP GRM, as defined below. CP GRM is not calculated under IFRS, but management believes that this information 
should be provided as it enables investors to better understand the underlying performance of the Vadinar refinery. 
The differences between CP EBITDA and EBITDA for the Refining and Marketing operations are set out in the table below:
year ended 31 December 
(US$ million) 2010 2009

 Hedging gain (2.0) (8.3)
ebit Da – r efining and marketing (including sales tax benefit) 514.7 515.5
The GRM is calculated as actual sales net of crude costs derived from the accounts. Inventory gains and losses, hedging gains 
and losses and sales tax benefit for the period also form part of the GRM. Based on this method of calculation, Essar Energy’s 
GRMs are not directly comparable to the performance of other refiners, other refining benchmarks and industry as further 
discussed on in Appendix 1 on page 116.
The Refining and Marketing operations’ results (including the impact of sales tax benefit) are as follows:

US$140.6 million from US$358.8 million in 2009 to US$499.4 million in 2010, as a result of additional sales tax benefit due  
to higher sales in Gujarat and higher underlying product prices.

Net finance costs comprise of US$336.6 million (2009: US$309.8 million) of finance costs charged to the income statement and 
finance income of US$49.2 million (2009: US$26.0 million). Net finance costs have remained relatively flat year on year with an 
increase of US$3.6 million as the rise in total finance costs of US$108.3 million mostly negated by an increase in net interest 
income of US$23.2 million, as a result of interest received on IPO net proceeds, as well as the increase in interest capitalised of 
US$92.6 million in respect of costs directly attributed to assets under construction. 
taxation
The income tax charge of US$117 .2 million in 2010 comprises current tax of US$30.6 million (2009: US$2.8 million) and deferred 
tax of US$86.6 million (2009: US$76.1 million). The current tax charge has increased by US$27 .8 million primarily due to an 
increase in profits which are subject to corporate income tax or Minimum Alternative Tax (‘MAT’), as appropriate. The majority of 
profits derived from companies in India are subject to MAT. MAT is charged on book profits in India at a rate of 19.93%, but is 
available as a credit against corporate income tax in the following 10 years. The deferred tax charge of US$86.6 million (2009: 
US$76.1 million) in 2010 is mainly on account of property, plant and equipment and the impact of unabsorbed depreciation.  
The Group’s 2010 effective tax rate was 32% compared with the 2009 rate of 28%. 
n on-operational items
Non-operational gains have increased by US$41.2 million to US$61.0 million in the current period compared to US$19.8 million in 
2009. Further non-operational gains in 2010 are largely driven by a foreign exchange gain of US$41.3 million (2009: nil) from the 
conversion of the IPO proceeds into US dollars, profit on sale of available for sale investments of US$11.2 million (2009: nil) as 
part of the reorganisation of the Group prior to IPO, the gain on settlement of liabilities with third party banks of US$10.1 million 
(2009: nil) and a US$19.1 million reduction as a result of one off gains in the prior year relating to surplus on acquisition of a joint 
controlled entity, Kenya Petroleum Refinery Limited. 
profit after tax
Profit after tax has increased by US$41.5 million, representing a 20% growth, from US$206.8 million in 2009 to US$248.3 million 
in 2010 as a result of improvements in the operations as discussed above. Earnings per share of 17 .1 cents in 2010 is broadly in 
line with the calculated value for 2009 of 17 .0 cents per share despite the increase in earnings as the number of shares have 
increased post IPO. Further information on earnings per shares is included in Note 10.

property, plant and equipment – power
Property, plant and equipment include US$2,856.2 million capitalised in respect of power expansion projects, an increase  
of US$2,017 .8 million against 2009. Power plants under construction also comprise of the acquisition of the Aries coal mine 
(US$118.0 million) in Indonesia, US$155.1 million in respect of the Navabharat Power project (including US$50.2 million 
acquisition consideration) and US$29.9 million acquisition of the Mozambique mine. 
property, plant and equipment – exploration and production
A further US$52.8 million of capital expenditure has been recognised in respect of the Raniganj block, the Ratna fields, and 
various other blocks. Further, foreign exchange translation differences of US$6.0 million have also increased property, plant  
and equipment. There were no impairments of Exploration and Production assets in the period, in line with the prior year. 
property, plant and equipment – r efining and marketing
The Vadinar refinery Phase 1 project resulted in additions of US$725.5 million in 2010, with cumulative assets under construction 
of US$1,338.7 million at 31 December 2010 (2009: US$613.2 million). Additionally, foreign exchange translation differences  
of US$178.0 million (2009: US$140.0 million) have further increased property, plant and equipment as compared to  
31 December 2009. 
o ther non-current assets
Other non-current assets have increased by US$272.4 million year on year primarily as a result of further sales tax assignment 
liability paid and increased arrangement fees for currently unutilised debt facilities for use on our expansion projects. Other 
non-current assets include US$275.1 million (2009: US$121.6 million) which reflects sales tax assignment liability paid to a related 
party. The related party has committed to discharge the sales tax liability as it falls due in accordance with the sales tax incentive 
scheme as detailed in Note 28 of the financial statements.
c urrent assets
Currents assets have increased by US$1,228.1 million to US$3,363.6 million year on year primarily as result of the following: 
increase of US$492.3 million and US$221.8 million in cash and cash equivalents and other financial assets following receipt  ¸ ¸
of IPO funds after partial utilisation to fund expansion projects in 2010; 
increase of US$330.1 million and US$230.1 million in inventories and trade and other receivables due to an increase in crude ¸ ¸
oil prices and value of refinery products as well as record throughput in 2010; and
US$41.3 million reduction in available for sale investment following the disposal of Essar Steel Limited shares and other ¸ ¸
investments during 2010 at fair value. 
c urrent liabilities 
Current liabilities reduced by 20% to US$2,772.0 million year on year partly driven by a reclassification of acceptances from short 
term to long term trade and other payables of US$560.7 million, discussed further below, as well as US$168.9 million reduction 
in short term borrowings in line with the strategy to secure long term borrowings. 
n on-current liabilities
Non-current liabilities have increased by US$2,536.8 million, representing a 100% increase year on year primarily due to  
the following:
US$560.7 million of acceptances were transferred from current to non-current trade and other payables reflecting a change  ¸ ¸

Essar Energy’s operating cash flow increased from US$478.1 million in 2009 to US$652.7 million in 2010, an increase of 
US$174.6 million, or 36%. The increase is primarily driven by an increase in profit before tax and increase in operational  
activity, which has benefited from improved profits from the Power business, record refinery throughput and improved year  
on year GRM. 
Net cash used in investing activities has increased by US$1,972.0 million from US$640.0 million in 2009. This reflects the 
Company’s investment in its Refining and Power expansion projects and expenditures for Exploration and Production activities. 
Additionally interest paid has increased by 35% year on year reflecting the Company’s utilisation of available debt facilities to fund 
expansion projects. 
Equity infusion of US$2,442.5 million represents the promoter investments of US$630.2 million in the Power, Exploration and 
Production and Refining and Marketing businesses prior to the Group’s formation, and IPO net proceeds of US$1.8 billion.
c apital and liquidity
During the year, the Group raised equity of US$1.9 billion through its IPO. Capital of US$717 .2 million, US$55.0 million and 
US$440.0 million was invested in the Power, Exploration and Production and Refining and Marketing business segments during 
the year, respectively. The surplus cash was invested in high rated liquid funds and bank deposits in line with the Group’s 
financial and risk policy as well as the provision of US$225.0 million of trade advances to the Refining and Marketing businesses 
for working capital requirements.

Gearing % (net debt/(net debt + total equity)) 45.9 59.8
The Group has net debt of US$3,933.9 million (2009: US$3,037 .6 million) and gearing of 45.9% (2009: 59.8%). The gearing ratio 
has reduced by 23% year on year largely as a result of an increase in equity and cash and cash equivalents following the IPO. It 
is anticipated that the Group’s gearing will increase in future periods once further financing is drawn to fund capital expenditure 
on expansion projects. 
During the year, the Group raised project financing of US$4,316.3 million, US$127 .9 million and US$252.8 million for the 
expansion projects of the Power, Exploration and Production and Refining and Marketing business segments, respectively. At 31 
December 2010, the Group had US$750.0 million (2009: US$918.9 million) of short term borrowings outstanding. 
The majority of the borrowings are for the Power business and are project financing facilities with limited recourse to the 
Company. Additionally, the majority of the arranged facilities are in Indian rupees to match the revenue streams for the Power 
business thereby reducing exchange rate risk. The Group continues to be able to borrow at competitive rates for working capital 
and expansion projects. 
Post year end, the Group also raised US$550 million through a convertible bond issue which has further strengthened the 
liquidity position of the Group. This demonstrates the Group’s ability to manage its capital and liquidity position and to capitalise 
on market opportunities as they arise. 
Going c oncern
The Group closely monitors and manages its liquidity risk. In assessing the Group’s going concern status, the Directors have 
taken account of financial position of the Group, anticipated future trading performance, its bank and other facilities, its capital 
investment plans, forecast gross refining margins and the likelihood of any material adverse legal judgements. The IPO in 2010 
and our recent convertible bond issue of US$550 million in February 2011 have further strengthened the Group’s financial 
position and ability to meet its financial obligations as they fall due.
The Group’s forecasts and projections, taking account of reasonably possible changes in trading performance, show that the 
Group should be able to operate within the level of its current available funding. As set out in Note 27 to the financial statements, 
the Group believes it has a high likelihood of success in the sales tax litigation but if it were unsuccessful, the Directors are 
confident that the Group can manage its financial affairs, including securing additional funding and reaching agreement with 
lenders, so as to ensure that sufficient funding remains available for the next 12 months.
On this basis, after making appropriate enquiries, the Directors consider that the Group has adequate resources to continue in 
operational existence for the foreseeable future. Accordingly, they continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the 
2010 accounts. Essar Energy plc Annual report + accounts 2010

principal risks and uncertainties
Effective risk management is integral to delivering our 
strategic goals, whilst protecting our reputation and 
shareholder value.
Following the detailed risk review 
undertaken as part of the IPO process, 
the Board has made significant 
progress in implementing a robust 
risk management framework which 
not only serves to identify and monitor 
risks across our business, but also 
to establish specific management 
controls to reduce the incident 
and impact of those risks. 
approach to risk management 
The overall responsibility for risk 
management and determination of 
appetite to undertake activities subject 
to risk and uncertainty resides with the 
Board of Essar Energy. However, given 
the nature of our business, the boards 
of our divisions and key management 
personnel across the Company play 
an important part in managing and 
monitoring risks. The Company has 
established formal policies to promote 
an environment of good governance 
and robust risk management.
The Board has established a risk 
register that identifies strategic risks 
together with financial, operational and 
compliance risks. The register includes 
a description of the nature, extent and 
implication of the risks together with 
the related management controls. The 
effectiveness of management controls 
has been considered in 2010, with 
supporting documentation provided 
by those responsible for monitoring 
specific risks within the business. 
The controls over risk management 
have also been subject to internal 
audit in 2010 with no significant 
weaknesses identified in respect of the 
Company’s policies and procedures. 
o ngoing monitoring of risks
The risk register is formally reviewed 
by the Board on a half yearly basis to 
monitor principal risks and the strategies 
deployed to mitigate them. Ongoing 
monitoring and management of risks 
takes place on a monthly basis at the 
Management Committee meetings 
where the Chief Executive and Chief 
Financial Officer of Essar Energy along 
with divisional senior management 
discuss key developments and new 
risk arising within the underlying 
business divisions. Similarly, the 
developments in risks impacting 
the Company at corporate level are 
discussed at each Board meeting. The 
Audit Committee is also charged with 
monitoring effective implementation 
of controls across the business that 
specifically impact financial risks. 
Further details of the procedures 
undertaken by the Board of Essar 
Energy and its Committees are set out 
in the Corporate Governance report.
There are a number of risks and 
uncertainties which could have an 
impact on the Company’s results and 
operations in light of the nature of the 
industries in which our businesses 
operate. Our principal risks are:
Group-wide risks
ris K ¸ ¸ implication ¸ ¸ miti Gation ¸ ¸
Compliance with 
regulation and obtaining 
licenses and permits
All of the Company’s operations ¸ ¸
are extensively regulated and the 
delivery of our strategy is largely 
dependent on obtaining the 
appropriate permits, approvals 
and licenses to complete our 
expansion projects, complying 
with their conditions and the 
exploration and development 
of oil, gas and coal blocks. The 
failure to obtain or comply with 
the terms of such permits and 
approvals would prevent the Group 
from achieving its growth targets 
and could ultimately lead to the 
impairment of existing assets.
The Company closely monitors ¸ ¸
compliance with regulatory 
requirements across its business 
and heads of each division and 
operations confirm compliance with 
all applicable laws and regulations. 
The need for permits, approvals ¸ ¸
and licenses for expansion 
projects and the exploration 
and development of oil, gas 
and coal blocks is assessed 
prior to undertaking any works 
or investments. The ability to 
obtain the necessary regulatory 
approvals to successfully deliver 
our strategic goals on time is largely 
out of the control of Management. 
However, Essar continues to have 
a successful working relationship 
with national, state and local 
authorities and expects to obtain 
all necessary approvals. Essar Energy plc Annual report + accounts 2010

Our ability to complete 
major projects on time 
and within budget
The Company is reliant on the ¸ ¸
completion of major projects to 
maintain its projected growth 
levels. In particular, there is a 
need to ensure projects are 
managed on time, including 
the delivery by contractors and 
suppliers, and within budget using 
efficient technologies to achieve 
the required specifications. If 
projects are not executed on 
time and to budget, the planned 
growth and profitability of the 
Group will not be achieved.
The Company has outsourced the ¸ ¸
management and construction 
of major projects to specialist 
expert project management and 
EPC contractors who are related 
parties. The risk of overruns is 
further mitigated through entering 
turnkey contracts with these 
contractors and suppliers. 
Progress on all major projects ¸ ¸
is monitored on a monthly basis 
by the relevant project review 
managers who report to the Project 
Management Committee. Key 
concerns are reported to the Essar 
Energy Management Committee 
and ultimately the Board, where 
actions to be undertaken are 
considered and agreed.
Funding requirements 
for future growth
The Company operates in a ¸ ¸
capital intensive industry and has 
significant financing requirements. 
This requires continued access 
to commercial banking facilities, 
capital markets and maintenance of 
short term working capital funding 
as well as continued compliance 
with banking covenants. 
The Company also needs to ¸ ¸
service debt raised on a timely 
basis. The servicing of working 
capital funding is dependent on 
timely payments from customers 
whilst specific debt raised for 
expansion projects largely 
depends on timely completion 
of related projects. If the Group 
does not have access to funds 
or fail to service its debt on a 
timely basis it could put at risk 
its status as a going concern.
The completion of the IPO in 2010 ¸ ¸
as well as the convertible bond 
issue announced in January 2011 
has significantly improved the 
Company’s liquidity position and 
ability to meet equity financing 
requirements. Essar continues 
to have a strong relationship 
with banks putting the business 
in a strong position to raise 
necessary debt financing for 
our projects and operations.
The Company also maintains ¸ ¸
working capital and cash flow 
projections to identify funding 
requirements and ensure facilities 
are available to meet short term 
funding needs. The risk of funding 
shortfalls is further mitigated by 
arranging debt in India where 
standard market practice is to 
automatically roll over facilities 
unless circumstances significantly 
change. The Group has historically 
successfully rolled over facilities 
in line with market practice and 
retains good banking relationships. 
In addition, banking covenants ¸ ¸
are monitored on an ongoing 
basis to ensure compliance. 
Servicing of specific debt raised ¸ ¸
for expansion projects is managed 
through agreeing repayment 
profiles consistent with the timeline 
for completion of related projects. Essar Energy plc Annual report + accounts 2010

Our ability to retain tax 
incentives in the future
The Company currently enjoys, ¸ ¸
in the form of tax holidays, 
exemptions and subsidies, the 
benefit of various tax incentives 
provided by the Indian Federal 
and state authorities designed 
to encourage investment in the 
power and oil and gas sectors. 
These incentives have a material 
impact on the investment returns 
on the Company’s existing and 
planned power plants, exploration 
and production projects, and the 
Vadinar refinery. In addition, the 
Company is currently engaged 
in litigation with the Government 
of Gujarat, which has been 
appealed to the Supreme Court, 
in respect of deferment of 
payment of certain sales taxes. 
The Company’s results and ¸ ¸
financial position would be 
materially adversely affected 
should claims for these 
benefits be disallowed. 
The Company continues to monitor ¸ ¸
changes and developments in 
respect of incentives provided 
by the Indian Federal and state 
authorities. Project investment 
returns are evaluated based on 
the expected incentives available 
to the Company and are revised 
based on the most up to date 
guidance available. In respect 
of the deferment of payments of 
certain tax incentives within the 
State of Gujarat, the Company 
has received a favourable legal 
opinion and judgement at the High 
Court and believes its position 
to be supportable and justified 
within the appeal process. The 
matter continues to be monitored 
closely with appropriate provisions 
being considered at each 
financial reporting period end.
Reliance on Essar 
Global and affiliated 
Essar companies as 
major suppliers and 
customers and 
managing conflicts  
of interest
The Power business, in particular, ¸ ¸
is dependent on Essar Group 
companies as major suppliers 
and customers. The loss of 
this relationship could have a 
significant impact on the Group’s 
continued success. In addition, 
as the controlling shareholder, 
Essar Global may have conflicting 
interests with the Company. This 
could lead to transactions being 
entered into that would not be in 
the best interests of the Group.
The Company has a close ¸ ¸
working relationship with Essar 
Global with representation of 
senior Essar Global members 
on the Board. There are 
also long term contractual 
arrangements with Essar Global 
and other Essar companies 
to ensure the Company’s 
interests remain protected.

The Company is at risk of ¸ ¸
commercial and reputational 
damage as a result of Health, 
Safety or Environmental incidents 
given the nature of its operations. 
Further, relationships built with local 
communities in locations where the 
Company operates needs to be 
maintained to avoid any operational 
disruptions. The loss of confidence 
any incident might create could 
have an adverse effect on the 
overall valuation of the Group and 
its ability to work effectively with 
local and national authorities.
The Company has a formal Health, ¸ ¸
Safety and Environmental policy 
with related HSE management 
systems in place. These are 
communicated to the relevant 
businesses and employees with 
training provided on a regular basis. 
Regular reviews are carried ¸ ¸
out on compliance with the 
HSE policy and related HSEMS 
as well as adherence with 
regulatory requirements. The 
HSE Committee reports directly 
to the Board, which ultimately 
monitors the effectiveness of 
various policies and systems. 
Tools are in place to monitor ¸ ¸
emissions from plants and the 
refinery. Medical expertise and 
support is available at all locations.
The Company works closely with ¸ ¸
local communities to maintain 
relationships and to ensure 
that concerns are heard and 
acted upon on a timely basis.
Fluctuations in foreign 
exchange rates
The price of feedstock, natural ¸ ¸
gas, imported coal and crude oil 
needed to run the Group’s power 
operations and for the production 
of refined petroleum products are 
generally denominated in or tied to 
the US dollar, with other operating 
expenses denominated in rupees.
Additionally, the Company’s ¸ ¸
functional and presentational 
currency is the US dollar. Therefore, 
it also faces translation risk to the 
extent assets, liabilities, revenues 
and expenses of its subsidiaries 
are denominated in currencies 
other than the US dollar. 
Whilst the Company’s results are ¸ ¸
presented in US dollars, dividends 
to shareholders will be paid in 
pound sterling in the future. 
As such changes in the ¸ ¸
exchange rates could significantly 
impact both the operational 
and reported results.
The business enters into forward ¸ ¸
foreign exchange contracts to 
cover foreign currency payments 
and receipts as well as to 
manage foreign exchange risks 
associated with anticipated sales 
and purchase transactions. 
The Management Committee 
monitors the level of exposure to 
foreign exchange rate fluctuations 
across the business and makes 
recommendations in respect of 
future hedging. Formal strategic 
polices are under implementation 
to define the business’ appetite 
for foreign exchange fluctuation, 
which will be rolled out across 
the Company going forward. Essar Energy plc Annual report + accounts 2010

Fluctuation of crude oil 
prices, refined petroleum 
products prices and 
refining margins
The Oil business is dependent ¸ ¸
on the margin between crude 
oil prices and refined petroleum 
product prices to maintain 
profitability. Operating efficiency 
and access to crude oil of the 
required quantity, quality and 
prices has a significant impact 
on the Company’s performance. 
Whilst refined product normally 
tracks changes in feedstock prices, 
there is normally a lag which 
could seriously impact short term 
working capital and profitability.
The Oil business uses long term ¸ ¸
contracts as well open international 
markets to source crude oil at 
competitive prices. Management 
prepare four month rolling plans 
on a weekly basis to identify any 
changes in risk profile and take 
appropriate action on a timely 
basis. The use of commodity 
hedging further reduces fluctuation 
in refining margins. Other methods 
are also used by the Oil business 
to drive down costs such as 
increase in the use of cheaper 
tough crudes and use of blending 
of different grades to improve 
the product slate as well as 
increasing production efficiency 
through technological advances.
Exposure to adverse 
weather conditions and 
natural disasters
The Company has experienced ¸ ¸
delays in both operational activity 
and completing projects as a result 
of adverse weather conditions. The 
locations of the major assets are in 
areas that are subject to adverse 
weather conditions and/or natural 
disaster. The hazardous nature 
of the Company’s operations 
exacerbates the impact of adverse 
weather and natural disaster. This 
could result in the shutting down 
of major assets with consequent 
failure to maintain profitability and 
requiring additional capital to bring 
the asset back into its former state.
Management undertakes a ¸ ¸
detailed risk assessment prior 
to the commencement of major 
projects that considers the 
potential for adverse weather 
and natural disaster.
In addition, business continuity ¸ ¸
measures, in accordance with the 
Business Continuity policy and 
Crisis Management procedures, 
are in place for locations and 
ongoing projects at risk. 
Appropriate insurance is also ¸ ¸
taken to further reduce the

Timely access to coal 
and other fuel supplies 
at appropriate prices
The Company requires access ¸ ¸
to coal and other fuel supplies 
at appropriate prices in order to 
generate profits from its Power 
expansion projects as well as 
its existing power plants. Whilst 
the Power expansion projects 
have captive supplies identified, 
a delay in obtaining permissions 
to extract coal may result in the 
need to purchase temporary 
supplies at regulated or market 
prices. This could have a 
significant impact on profitability.
The Company will be able to ¸ ¸
source coal internally once the 
available 450 tonnes of coal 
resources can be developed. In 
the short term, the Company will 
secure temporary supply through 
tapering coal linkages, third party 
contracts and market purchases.
Power plant availability 
and profitability
The Power business’ profitability ¸ ¸
is largely a function of its ability 
to operate its power plants to 
ensure availability under the 
terms of the Power Purchase 
Agreements. The failure to 
achieve required availability levels 
would have a direct impact on 
profitability and cash flow.
In addition, the Power business ¸ ¸
seeks to expand further into the 
merchant sales market which will 
not provide the Company with 
the same level of protection for 
fixed and variable costs involved 
in generating power, as currently 
received under PPAs, and may 
be subject to seasonality. This 
would result in less certainty when 
projecting profits and cash flow.
The plants’ availability levels ¸ ¸
are continually monitored to 
ensure issues are highlighted 
and addressed with immediate 
effect. The low average age of the 
Company’s plants and regular 
maintenance enhance efficiency 
levels. Costs are also managed 
through fixed supply agreements 
and secured fuel supply. 
The Company intends to supply ¸ ¸
power for merchant sales from the 
lowest cost power stations in order 
to ensure the profitability of these 
plants even at low merchant prices.
Reliance on a few  
major customers 
The Power business supplies to a ¸ ¸
small number of large customers 
under PPAs. In particular, there is a 
significant relationship with GUVNL 
in respect of the provision of power. 
The Company has in the past 
experienced payment difficulties for 
services provided to GUVNL which, 
if continued could have a significant 
impact on the Company’s results. 
There is also an ongoing litigation 
case with GUVNL, which may 
result in financial losses.
The litigation with GUVNL ¸ ¸
continues to be ongoing at the 
date of this report. To date the 
court rulings have been largely 
in favour of the Company and 
Management consider the need 
for appropriate provisions at

Relationship agreement
Prior to Listing, Essar Energy was a wholly owned subsidiary of 
Essar Global. On 30 April 2010 Essar Energy and Essar Global 
entered into a relationship agreement to regulate the ongoing 
relationship between the Company and Essar Global. The 
principal purpose of the Relationship Agreement is to ensure 
that the Group is capable of carrying on its business 
independently of Essar Global and its associates (for the 
purpose of this summary, as defined in the Relationship 
Agreement) and that transactions and relationships are at  
arm’s length and on normal commercial terms (other than 
certain de minimis transactions). 
The Relationship Agreement will continue for so long as the 
ordinary shares are listed on the premium listing segment of 
the Official List and traded on the LSE and Essar Global, 
together with its associates, have an aggregate interest at  
least of 30% in the issued shares of Essar Energy.
The key terms of the Relationship Agreement are set out in 
Appendix 2 of this Report on page 116. 
The Directors believe that the terms of the Relationship 
Agreement will enable the Company to carry on its business 
independently from the Essar Group and its associates.
Directors
The names and biographies of the current Directors of the 
Company are set out on pages 08 to 10.
The Company was incorporated on 18 December 2009.  
Mr Raman Jaggi was appointed as a Director when the 
Company was incorporated and resigned as a Director  
on 6 April 2010 when the current Board was appointed.
Directors’ appointment and retirement
The Directors may from time to time appoint one or more 
Directors. Any such Director shall hold office only until the  
next Annual General Meeting (‘AGM’) and shall then offer 
themselves for election by the Company’s shareholders. In 
accordance with the Company’s articles of association, which 
require the Directors to retire and offer themselves for election 
by shareholders at the first AGM after their appointment, all  
the Directors will be offering themselves for election at the 
forthcoming AGM. This is also in accordance with current best 
practice as outlined in the UK Corporate Governance Code 
which applies to the Company from 1 January 2011 and 
provides for all directors of FTSE 350 companies to be subject 
to election or re-election by their shareholders every year.
Directors’ indemnities and insurance
Directors and officers are indemnified under the articles of 
association of the Company, to the extent permitted by the 
Companies Act 2006. In addition, the Company has entered 
into deeds of indemnity with each Director in respect of 
proceedings brought by third parties, subject to the conditions 
set out in the Companies Act 2006. The Company has also 
purchased Directors’ and Officers’ liability insurance which 
remains in place at the date of this report. Essar Energy plc Annual report + accounts 2010

2 On 18 January 2011, Essar Global acquired an economic interest in a further 16,973,961 
shares pursuant to an equity swap transaction as part of the convertible bond

essential contracts
The Company has entered into long term refined petroleum 
product off-take agreements, which together accounted for 
52% of the Group’s net sales, with the following Indian national 
oil companies: a four year agreement with Bharat Petroleum 
Corporation Limited effective from April 2008, a four year 
agreement with Hindustan Petroleum Corporation Limited 
effective from January 2008 (extendable by one year) and a 
two year agreement with Indian Oil Corporation Limited 
effective from April 2009, the renewal of which is currently 
being negotiated. Under the terms of these agreements, the 
Company is not guaranteed any binding minimum off-take 
quantity from the Indian national oil companies, however,  
due to the pricing terms for sales to the Indian national oil 
companies, the Company is able to generate higher margins 
on sales to these customers than on export sales and the 
Company considers these arrangements are essential to the 
business of the Group within the meaning of Section 417(5)(c) 
of the Companies Act 2006.
amendments to the articles of association
Any amendments to the articles of association of the Company 
may be made by special resolution of the shareholders.
significant agreements
The Companies Act 2006 requires disclosure of significant 
agreements that take effect, alter or terminate on a change  
of control of the Company. These are as set out below:
Convertible bond issue
In February 2011, the Group issued US$500 million 4.25% 
guaranteed senior unsecured convertible bonds due 2016, 
described in more detail in ‘Post balance sheet events’ below. 
The bond issue was subsequently increased to US$550 million 
due to the exercise of an over-allotment option of 
US$50 million.
Pursuant to the final terms attaching to the bonds, the 
bondholders will have the right to require the Group to redeem 
the bonds at a price equal to the principal amount, together 
with accrued and unpaid interest to the date of redemption  
or if there is a change of control of the Company in which any 
person or persons, acting together (other than Essar Global  
or any person(s) controlled by or acting together with Essar 
Global) acquires or becomes entitled to control more than  
50% of the voting rights of the Company.
Relationship agreement
The Relationship agreement between Essar Global and the 
Company (described in detail on page 50) will terminate should 
Essar Global, together with its associates (as defined in the 
Relationship Agreement), cease to have an aggregate interest 
in 30% or more of the issued share capital of the Company.

Responsibility report on page 36.
Creditor payment policy
It is the Group’s payment policy, in respect of all suppliers, to 
settle agreed outstanding accounts in accordance with terms 
and conditions agreed with suppliers when placing orders and 
suppliers are made aware of these payment conditions. The 
Group’s trade creditors as a proportion of amounts invoiced by 
suppliers represented 62 days at 31 December 2010. 
Post balance sheet events
On 18 January 2011, Essar Energy launched an offering of 
US$500 million of convertible bonds due 2016. The bonds 
were successfully priced with a coupon of 4.25% payable 
semi-annually in arrears and a conversion price set at a 
premium of 30% to the reference price of US$8.5277 (c.£5.37) 
per share. The offering size was subsequently increased to 
US$550 million due to the exercise of an over-allotment option 
of US$50 million. The convertible bonds were issued on 
1 February 2011. Essar Global, the majority shareholder of 
Essar Energy, did not participate in the convertible bond 
transaction, but they did enter into an equity swap transaction 
with Standard Chartered Bank whereby EGL acquired an 
additional economic interest of US$144.75 million in Essar 
Energy’s ordinary shares. The swap will last for the life of the 
convertible bonds and may be settled by EGL receiving cash 
or, at EGL ’s option, shares. The result of the equity swap 
transaction is to increase EGL ’s economic interest in Essar 
Energy to 78.02% from 76.72% as at 31 December 2010.

On 18 February 2011, Essar Energy announced that it had 
entered into an exclusivity agreement with Shell UK Limited 
and made an offer to purchase the oil refinery and other 
associated assets at Stanlow, near Ellesmere Port, Cheshire 
for a cash consideration of US$350 million. There will also be  
a separate payment for the crude oil, refined products and 
certain other inventory on the Stanlow refinery site, to be 
valued on completion of the acquisition based on prevailing 
market prices (estimated to be in the region of US$780 million). 
The acquisition of the high complexity Stanlow refinery, which 
is the second largest refinery in the UK, will give Essar Energy 
direct access to the UK market, is aligned with the Company’s 
strategy to provide options for the export of products from the 
Vadinar refinery in India, and is being acquired at a competitive 
price when compared to other recent comparable refinery 
transactions. The acquisition will be conditional, amongst other 
items, on the approval of Essar Energy’s shareholders at a 
general meeting. The acquisition is expected to be completed 
in the second half of 2011.

introduction
The Company is committed to maintaining the highest 
standards of corporate governance both in respect of its 
management of the Group and its businesses and its 
accountability to its shareholders as a whole. This section  
of the annual report sets out the corporate governance 
framework for the Company and how it has evolved since  
the Company listed its shares on the Main Market of the  
LSE on 7 May 2010.
The Combined Code on Corporate Governance, which was 
issued in its amended form in June 2008 by the Financial 
Reporting Council, sets out the standards of good practice  
in relation to corporate governance in the form of a set of 
principles and guidance. In relation to section 1 of the 
Combined Code, the Financial Services Authority requires 
listed companies to disclose how they have applied these 
principles and to explain whether they have complied with the 
provisions of the Combined Code throughout the financial year.
Since Listing, the Company has complied with the Combined 
Code in all respects, save for the following: 
(i) Code Provision A.1.3. the Non-Executive Directors have 
not yet met to appraise the Chairman’s performance; 
(ii) Code Provision A.2.2. the Chairman did not meet the 
independence criteria set out in the Combined Code on 
his appointment, due to his interest in the Company; and 
(iii) Code Provision A. 6. 1. a Board evaluation has not yet 
been undertaken.
In relation to (i) and (iii) above, as the Directors were appointed 
in April 2010 just prior to Listing, the Board is of the view that a 
meaningful evaluation of the Board can only take place once 
the Board has worked together for a full year. The evaluation 
policy will therefore be developed and implemented in 2011. 
Likewise, the Non-Executive Directors will meet to appraise  
the Chairman in 2011. 
In relation to (ii) above, The Chairman was not independent at 
the time of his appointment and remains non-independent as 
he is also Vice Chairman of the Essar Group and is indirectly a 
majority shareholder in the Company. In view of the Chairman’s 
position as one of the founders of the Essar Group and his 
extensive involvement with Essar Oil and Essar Power over a 
period of many years, the Board considers that his knowledge 
of Essar and role in building it into one of India’s premier 
business groups provides significant benefits to Essar Energy, 
outweighing any potential conflicts. The Chairman has made a 
major contribution to the Group’s growth and success and the 
Board is unanimously of the opinion that his continued 
involvement is crucially important to the ongoing success  
of the Company.
t he role and structure of the Board 
The Board consists of seven Directors, made up of the 
Chairman, Vice Chairman and Chief Executive and four 
independent Non-Executive Directors. Biographies of all the 
Board members appear on pages 8 to 10 of this annual report. 
In April 2010, the Chairman, Mr Ravi Ruia; the Vice Chairman, 
Mr Prashant Ruia; the Chief Executive, Mr Naresh Nayyar and 
the four independent Non-Executive Directors; Mr Philip Aiken, 
Mr Sattar Hajee Abdoula, Mr Subhash Lallah and Mr Simon 
Murray, were appointed to the Board.
The Board is collectively responsible for the long term success 
of the Company and has ultimate responsibility for the 
management, direction and performance of the Group and  
its businesses. The Board is required to exercise objective 
judgement on all corporate matters and is accountable  
to shareholders for the proper conduct of the business. 
The day to day management of the Company is delegated  
to and run by the Chief Executive and the Management 
Committee, the role of which is described below. The Board 
has also delegated authority for specific matters to the 
Nominations and Governance Committee, the Remuneration 
Committee, the Audit Committee and the Health and Safety 
and Environment Committee. Further information on each  
of these committees is set out on pages 56 to 58 of this 
Corporate Governance report.
There are, however, a number of matters which are reserved 
for the Board’s decision. These are set out in a formal 
schedule, approved by the Board and include: 
the overall Group strategy and long range plans; ¸ ¸
stewardship of business performance; ¸ ¸
devising and reviewing the corporate governance structure ¸ ¸
of the Group;

the Bombay Stock Exchange and the National Stock Exchange 
of India. Essar Oil has its own board along with a management 
committee and audit committee that undertakes all the 
subsidiary’s corporate governance requirements and complies 
with the Indian listing requirements. Similarly, Essar Power, 
which operates Essar Energy’s power business in India, also 
has its own Board along with a management committee and 
audit committee. The chief executives of these businesses are 
members of the Essar Energy Management Committee.
t he management Committee

The Management Committee meets on a monthly basis. 
Management Committee members generally receive papers  
a week in advance of the meeting. Agenda items for each 
meeting include operations, financial performance and 
management accounts, an update on projects, use of funds 
and funding requirements and legal and corporate governance. 
The agenda will also include, at least twice a year, an item to 
monitor and review the effectiveness of the Group’s risk 
management policy.
Board balance and independence
Mr Ravi Ruia is the Chairman of the Company and is also Vice 
Chairman of the Essar Group, the Company’s controlling 
shareholder and a related party for the purposes of the Listing 
Rules of the UK Listing Authority. Mr Prashant Ruia is Vice 
Chairman of the Company and Chief Executive of the Essar 
Group, Mr Naresh Nayyar is Chief Executive of the Company. 
The majority of the Non-Executive Directors are determined  
by the Board to be independent, in compliance with the 
Combined Code recommendation that at least half the board 
of a UK listed company should comprise independent Non-
Executive Directors. Their independence provides a strong 
foundation for good corporate governance.

Chairman, vice Chairman and Chief executive
There is a clear division between the roles of Chairman, Vice

responsibilities has been approved by the Board. The 
Chairman is responsible for the operation, leadership and 
governance of the Board and for ensuring its effectiveness  
and setting its agenda. The Vice Chairman is responsible for 
leading, developing and managing the executive team and the 
Chief Executive is responsible for guiding the implementation

meetings a year. The Board also meets on an ad hoc basis in 
response to business needs. All the meetings of the Board and 
Board committees were held at the Essar Energy Head Office 
in Mauritius. There have been three scheduled Board meetings 
since Listing and a table of attendance of members of the

1 Board meetings convened at relatively short notice to deal with ad hoc commercial matters. Representation at such meetings reflects the short notice period given. Board members who 
were unable to attend received the briefing papers in advance and had the opportunity to provide their input prior to the meeting. Any such comments received were duly noted at the 
relevant meeting. Essar Energy plc Annual report + accounts 2010
56
The Directors receive appropriate briefing papers on 
substantive items, which are, in general, circulated at least a 
week before the relevant Board meeting to give the Directors 
adequate time to prepare for the meeting and to enable any 
Director who is unable to attend the meeting to have an 
opportunity to review the matters to be discussed and, if 
necessary, to provide comments to the Chairman in advance 
of the meeting. The Directors also receive regular updates on 
financial information between Board meetings. All Directors 
have the right to have their concerns about the running of the 
Company, or a proposed action which cannot be resolved, 
recorded in the minutes. 
Board development
All new Directors receive a comprehensive induction upon 
appointment to the Board. Programmes of continuing 
professional development are arranged as required, taking  
into account the individual qualifications and experience of  
the Directors. The Chairman is responsible for ensuring 
induction and training programmes are provided and the 
Company Secretary is tasked with organising such 
programmes. Individual Directors, with the support of the 
Company Secretary, are also expected to take responsibility  
for identifying their own training needs and to ensure that  
they are adequately informed about the Group and their 
responsibilities as a Director. 
All of the Directors received a comprehensive briefing on their 
duties and responsibilities as Directors of a UK Listed company 
by the Company’s advisors as part of the Listing process. 
Further briefings will take place in 2011 to ensure that the 
Directors are kept informed of relevant developments and that 
updates on the changes and developments to the business are 
provided at Board meetings as appropriate. A number of the 
Directors attended site visits prior to Listing and further site 
visits have taken place in 2011.
Advice
All Directors have access to the advice and services of the 
Company Secretary, who is responsible to the Board for 
ensuring that Board procedures are complied with. Both 
appointment and removal of the Company Secretary are a 
matter for the Board as a whole. All Directors also have access 
to the Group’s professional advisors whom they can consult  
at the Company’s expense should they consider this necessary 
in order to better discharge their responsibilities. 
Conflicts of interest
The Board is required to disclose any actual or potential 
conflicts of interest. The Directors declared any conflicts of 
interest at the time of Listing and a declaration of interests 
forms a standard item on the agenda for each Board meeting. 
A schedule of conflicts or potential conflicts for each Director is 
reviewed at least annually. In accordance with the Company’s 
Articles of Association, the Board is permitted to authorise  
any matter proposed to it which relates to a situation in which  
a Director has, or can have, an interest which conflicts, or 
possibly may conflict, with the interests of the Company.  
The Board may (whether at the time of the authorisation or 
subsequently) make any such authorisation subject to any 
limits or conditions it expressly imposes but such authorisation 
is otherwise given to the fullest extent permitted. The Board 
may vary or terminate any such authorisation at any time. 
Re-election of Directors at the AGM
The articles of association of the Company require that all 
Directors appointed by the Board submit themselves for 
election by shareholders at the first AGM following their 
appointment. As the forthcoming AGM will be the first since 
Listing, all the Directors will submit themselves for election by 
shareholders. This is also in compliance with the provisions of 
the new UK Corporate Governance Code, which will apply to 
the Company for the financial year ending 31 December 2011 
and requires that all Directors be re-elected on an annual basis. 
Going forward it is therefore intended that all Directors will 
stand for annual re-election at future AGMs.
The Directors being proposed for election have only been in 
the post since shortly before Listing and the Board remains 
satisfied that each Director proposed for election continues to 
be fully competent to carry out his responsibilities as a member 
of the Board.
The Board committees
Terms of reference for each of the following committees are 
available on the Company’s website, www.essarenergy.com.
Audit Committee
The Audit Committee is chaired by Mr Sattar Hajee Abdoula, 
an independent Non-Executive Director, who has over 30 years 
experience in accounting, audit and consultancy. The other 
members of the Committee are Mr Simon Murray and 
Mr Subhash Lallah. All of the members are, therefore, 
independent Non-Executive Directors.
Under its terms of reference, the Audit Committee is required 
to meet at least three times a year or more frequently as 
circumstances require. Since the Listing the Audit Committee 
has met four times. The Audit Committee reports on its 
activities to the Board, immediately following its meetings. 
Since Listing the Audit Committee has carried out various 
activities in accordance with the responsibilities set out in its 
terms of reference including the activities described below.
The Audit Committee has reviewed the 2010 annual report 
including the preliminary results before recommending them to 
the Board. In doing so the Committee reviewed and discussed 
the preliminary results and annual financial statements with 
management and the external auditors focusing particularly on:
the quality and acceptability of the accounting policies  ¸ ¸
and practices and financial reporting disclosures and 
changes thereto;
areas involving significant judgement, estimation or ¸ ¸
uncertainty;
the detecting of material misstatements by the auditors that ¸ ¸
individually or in aggregate have not been corrected and 
management’s explanations as to why adjustments have not 
been made;
the basis for the going concern assumption; and ¸ ¸

The Audit Committee oversees the relationship with the 
external auditors, Deloitte LLP, who were appointed auditors at 
the time of the IPO. In managing this relationship a policy on 
the engagement of the external auditors for non-audit services 
has been developed and implemented. When considering the 
reappointment of the Company’s external auditors before 
making a recommendation to the Board to be put to 
shareholders the Committee reviewed and monitored the 
external auditor’s independence and objectivity and the 
effectiveness of the audit process. Accordingly, the Committee 
recommends the reappointment of Deloitte LLP at the 
forthcoming AGM.
The Audit Committee is responsible for monitoring and 
reviewing the effectiveness of the internal audit function or 
considering the need for an internal audit function. The Audit 
Committee has outsourced the internal audit function by 
appointing Ernst & Young Pvt. Limited to undertake the role  
of internal auditor to the Group with effect from 1 November 
2010. Ernst & Young have put forward, and the Audit 
Committee has approved, a risk-based internal audit plan 
based on the business process value chain, the risks identified 
within the financial reporting process at the Listing, past 
internal audit activity carried out by the internal audit function  
of Essar Global and the views of the management. 
Internal audit is an independent review and support function 
whose primary role is to provide an objective evaluation of 
operations, information and control systems that the Company 
has put in place, primarily to the Audit Committee but also  
as a service to management. It provides analysis, 
recommendations, counsel, and information concerning the 
activities examined and provides assurance as well as 
guidance on the development of effective and efficient controls 
with respect to process integrity, accuracy in reporting and 
compliance with policies and regulation. As part of this service 
to management the internal audit meets quarterly with the 
management as part of a Management Audit Committee held 
prior to the Audit Committee meetings. This Committee is 
chaired by the Chief Executive and attended by the Chief 
Financial Officers of the businesses. The meeting provides an 
opportunity for the internal audit to report on their activities 
directly to the management to ensure actions are taking place 
and highlight any remedial actions necessary. 
Remuneration Committee
The members of the Remuneration Committee are Mr Subhash 
Lallah (Chairman of the Committee), Mr Simon Murray and 
Mr Philip Aiken. All of the members are independent 
Non-Executive Directors.
The role of the Remuneration Committee is to determine the 
framework or broad policy for the remuneration of Chairman, 
Vice Chairman, Chief Executive, the Chief Financial Officer the 
Company Secretary and any other members of the Senior 
Management as the Board may determine from time to time. 
Under its terms of reference, the Remuneration Committee is 
required to meet at least twice a year or more frequently as 
circumstances require. Since Listing, the Remuneration 
Committee has met twice. The Remuneration Committee 
reports on its activities to the Board, immediately following  
its meetings.
The Directors’ Remuneration report is set out on pages  
61 to 64. 
n ominations and Governance Committee
The members of the Nominations and Governance Committee 
are Mr Simon Murray (Chairman of the Committee), Mr 
Prashant Ruia and Mr Subhash Lallah. The majority of the 
members are, therefore, independent Non-Executive Directors.
The role of the Nominations and Governance Committee is to 
identify and nominate, for approval of the Board, candidates to 
fill Board vacancies as and when they arise as well as putting in 
place plans for succession for Directors and senior executives, 
in particular with respect to the Chairman, Vice Chairman and 
Chief Executive.
Under its terms of reference, the Nominations and Governance 
Committee is also responsible for reviewing the structure, size 
and composition, including the skills, knowledge and 
experience, of the Board and making recommendations to the 
Board about adjustments. When making an appointment, the 
Committee is required by its terms of reference to evaluate the 
balance of skills, knowledge and experience on the Board and 
consider candidates on merit and against objective criteria, 
taking care that appointees have enough time available to 
devote to the position.
Under its terms of reference, the Nominations and Governance 
Committee is required to meet at least twice a year and at such 
other times as the Chairman of the Committee shall require. 
Given that the Company only listed in May 2010, it has not 
considered it necessary for the Committee to meet during the 
last financial year. The Committee met on 3 March 2011 and 
the discussions included consideration of the forward looking 
agenda which will include a discussion on succession 
planning, a review of the size, structure and composition of the 
Board and the independence of the Non-Executive Directors.
Health, safety and environment Committee
The members of the Health, Safety and Environment 
Committee are independent Non-Executive Director Mr Philip 
Aiken (Chairman of the Committee), Mr Naresh Nayyar and 
Mr KVB Reddy, an Executive Director of the Company’s 
subsidiary, Essar Power.
The Health, Safety and Environment Committee assists the 
Board and the Management Committee in obtaining assurance 
that appropriate systems are in place to deal with the 
management of safety, health and environmental risks. The 
Health, Safety and Environment Committee will meet at least 
twice a year and has met once since Listing. In general the 
Health, Safety and Environment Committee meetings will be 
held in India with each meeting including a site visit.

32 and 37 of this annual report. Essar Energy plc Annual report + accounts 2010

internal Control
The Board has overall responsibility for the Group’s system  
of internal control and risk management and has delegated  
to the Audit Committee its responsibility for reviewing the 
effectiveness of these controls. The system of internal control 
is designed to manage rather than eliminate risk of failure to 
achieve business objectives, and can only provide reasonable 
and not absolute assurance against material misstatement 
or loss.
As part of the Listing process undertaken by the Group  
a comprehensive review was undertaken of the control 
environment. That review confirmed that the controls in 
operation prior to the formation of the Group at the operating 
companies were appropriate and that controls had been 
implemented at the Group level to provide a satisfactory control 
environment. During the year these controls have been refined 
and improved. The Group Internal Audit function has 
undertaken an exercise at the year end to confirm design  
and operating effectiveness of the controls. 
Control structure
The Board sets the policy on internal control that is 
implemented by Management. This is achieved through a 
clearly defined operating structure with lines of responsibility 
and delegated authority. 
The policy set by the Board is formally documented in the 
Group Governance and Administration Manual (the ‘Manual’) 
which clearly defines the limits of delegated authority and 
provides a framework for management to deal with areas  
of significant business risk. 
The Manual confirms a Code of Conduct that applies to all 
areas of the business and covers a requirement for all 
employees to comply with all applicable laws and regulations in 
the territories in which the Group operates. At operational level 
this Code of Conduct is covered through the detailed human 
resource policies that are available on the Group’s intranet.
The Board also approves individual policies covering areas that 
are identified as key for the Board to monitor. For example, a 
policy on the process for entering into and reporting related 
party transactions has been approved and circulated 
throughout the Group with individual briefings to the key 
individuals responsible for managing the process.
These policies and procedures are reviewed and, where 
necessary, updated at Management Committee meetings.
Control environment
The Group’s operating procedures include appropriate systems 
for reporting information to the Directors. These procedures 
are business dependent but all significant operational 
businesses use SAP general ledger systems with automated 
controls and reconciliation processes.
Budgets are prepared by subsidiary management and subject 
to review by the Chief Executive and then the Directors. The 
approved budgets are then used as the basis for controlling 
expenditure, with approval levels varying based on whether  
an item is within or exceeds budget.
The Management Committee and the Board review monthly 
management reports on the financial results and key operating 
statistics, together with a brief written explanation of significant 
variances or operational matters. The management reports are 
presented by the respective accountable individuals who 
provide further explanations as required.
The individual businesses monitor the progress of the 
expansion projects through regular project management review 
meetings to review progress and escalate issues to the Chief 
Executive, with any major issues reported to the Board.
Emphasis is placed on the quality and abilities of the Group’s 
employees, with structured evaluation processes and access 
to a variety of online, internally and externally provided learning 
and development tools. This is provided through a shared 
service agreement with the Essar Global Human Resources 
function that was agreed as part of the Listing process and 
enabled the seamless transition of employee development. The 
Essar Global Human Resources President is invited to attend 
Remuneration Committee meetings.
The acquisition of any business requires a rigorous analysis of 
the financial implications of the acquisition and key 
performance figures. A sensitivity analysis takes place of the 
key assumptions made in the analysis with formal 
presentations to the Board.
The Management Committee and Board have been provided 
with a report detailing any significant legal actions involving 
Group companies, which provides a background to the case 
and its current status within the appropriate legal system.
monitoring and review activities
A number of processes have been instituted for monitoring  
the system of internal control and reporting any significant 
control failings or weaknesses together with details of 
corrective action.
Corporate governance report continued Essar Energy plc Annual report + accounts 2010
59
company overview business review Governance financial statements
A formal annual confirmation has been introduced with the 
directors of each business segment certifying the operation of 
their control systems and highlighting any weaknesses. 
During the year a Group internal audit function was appointed, 
provided through an outsourced relationship with Ernst & 
Young Pvt. Limited. This internal audit function reports directly 
to the Audit Committee and has prepared a risk based audit 
plan agreed with the Audit Committee and undertaken a 
number of audits based on that plan. The Group has also 
formed a Management Audit committee chaired by the Chief 
Executive that reviews the results of internal audit reports to 
ensure any points raised are properly addressed.
A comprehensive and detailed risk register was established  
as part of the Listing process and has been updated and 
refreshed at the half year and year end to ensure all significant 
risks are appropriately managed. Significant risks and their 
mitigating actions along with any remedial actions are 
monitored by the Management Committee and subsequently 
reviewed by the Audit Committee and the Board.
Reports from the external auditors, Deloitte LLP, on certain 
internal controls and relevant financial reporting matters, are 
presented to the Audit Committee and management.
A hotline has been established providing arrangements by 
which staff may, in confidence, raise concerns about possible 
improprieties in matters of financial reporting or other matters. 
Staff may raise concerns in either English or the local language 
using a toll-free hotline phone number or by sending an email 
or letter to addresses especially created for the purpose. This 
policy has been disseminated across the Group.
r eview of effectiveness
The Directors, the Chief Executive and the Chief Financial 
Officer consider that any controls and procedures, no matter 
how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable 
and not absolute assurance of achieving the desired control 
objectives. The Group’s Management is required to apply 
judgement in evaluating the risks facing the Group in achieving 
its objectives, in determining the risks that are considered 
acceptable to bear, in assessing the likelihood of the risks 
concerned materialising, in identifying the Company’s ability to 
reduce the incidence and impact on the business of risks that 
do materialise and in ensuring the costs of operating particular 
controls are proportionate to the benefit.
In reviewing the effectiveness of the Group’s system of internal 
controls the Board has, through the Management Committee 
and the Audit Committee, taken account of the matters 
summarised above. The Board considers that these matters 
provide the key building blocks for an assessment of the 
control environment and that the measures that have been 
implemented both before and after the Listing are appropriate 
to the Group. The Board is committed to building on these 
measures through the execution of the internal audit 
programme and the continued review by the Management  
and Audit Committees.
r elations with investors 
The Company is committed to the promotion of investor 
confidence by ensuring that trade in its securities takes place in 
an efficient, competitive and informed market. The Company 
recognises the importance of forthright communication as key 
to building shareholder value and that, in order to prosper and 
achieve growth, it must (among other things) earn the trust of 
employees, customers, suppliers, communities and security 
holders by communicating openly and consistently delivering 
on its commitments. In doing so, the Company will comply  
with the continuous disclosure obligations relevant to a  
listed company. 
Since Listing, the Company has put in place a comprehensive 
programme of investor communications. This includes:
ensuring that all material information on the Company is ¸ ¸
broadly disseminated to investors, analysts and the media 
and that this information is available on our website at  
www.essarenergy.com. Distribution of information is via  
the UK’s regulatory news service and via email to our 
extensive contact database;
increasing the number of analysts providing investment ¸ ¸
research on Essar Energy. At the time of Listing, four broking 
firms provided research on the Company. This number has 
now increased to eight, with more brokers undertaking 
analysis to initiate coverage;
a programme of direct contact with major investors and ¸ ¸
potential investors including attendance at investor 
conferences and visits by senior management to major 
financial centres. Since Listing, cities visited include; London, 
Edinburgh, New York, Boston, Tokyo, Hong Kong, 
Singapore, Paris and Frankfurt. We intend to continue with 
this programme during 2011; and
ensuring that relevant and up to date information on  ¸ ¸
the Company and its operations is available on the 
Company’s website.

Remuneration report
I am pleased to present the first Remuneration report  
of Essar Energy. The Remuneration Committee’s key objective 
is to determine a remuneration package that reflects our 
performance driven culture and rewards our people 
appropriately. It takes into account the geographical locations 
and markets of our operations and the need to attract, motivate 
and retain our people.
In 2010, the Remuneration Committee undertook the following 
key activities:
agreement of the initial remuneration philosophy for the ¸ ¸
Board and key management personnel;
confirmation of the remuneration package for the Board and ¸ ¸
key management personnel for the Company’s first year of 
operations, following independent advice; and
approval of the Employee Stock Option Plan and granting ¸ ¸
options under that scheme. 
Going forward, we will review our remuneration arrangements 
to ensure that they encourage enhanced performance in a fair 
and responsible manner and reward contributions to the 
continuing success of the Group.

Chairman of the Remuneration Committee
18 March 2011
This report has been prepared in accordance with Schedule 8 
of the Large and Medium-sized Companies and Groups 
(Accounts and Reports) Regulations 2008. It also meets the 
relevant requirements of the Listing Rules of the Financial 
Services Authority and describes how the Board has applied 
the principles of good governance as set out in the Combined 
Code relating to Directors’ remuneration. Further information 
regarding the Company’s Board and its committees can be 
found in the Corporate Governance report. 
The Companies Act 2006 requires the auditors to report to the 
Company’s members on certain parts of this report and to 
state whether in their opinion those parts have been properly 
prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 2006. The 
report has therefore been divided into separate sections for 
unaudited and audited information.
(u naudited information)
Remuneration Committee
The Remuneration Committee is chaired by Mr Subhash 
Lallah, and its other members are Mr Simon Murray and Mr 
Philip Aiken, all of whom are considered by the Board to be 
independent Non-Executive Directors in accordance with the 
recommendation of the Combined Code. Other members of 
the Board or those with responsibilities over Human Resources 
matters may be invited to attend meetings except when their 
own remuneration is discussed. The details of the frequency 
and attendance of Remuneration Committee meetings are set 
out in the Corporate Governance report. 
Responsibilities  
The Remuneration Committee recommends the policy for the 
Executive Director’s remuneration and determines the levels of 
remuneration for the Executive Director, the Chairman and the 
Vice Chairman. Additionally, the Remuneration Committee 
recommends and monitors the level and structure of 
remuneration for members of key management personnel. 
The Remuneration Committee also reviews and approves the 
operation of share and share option schemes and the granting 
of share awards. It also reviews and advises the Board on any 
major changes in wider employee benefits. 
The remuneration of Non-Executive Directors is determined  
by the Board as a whole. No Director participates in the 
determination of his own remuneration.
The terms of reference for the Committee are reviewed 
periodically and are available on the Company’s website.
Deloitte LLP was independently retained by the Committee as 
advisors and have provided information on relevant current 
market practice and developments in best practice guidance. 
Deloitte LLP also provided audit and other services compatible 
with their roles as auditors to the Group, as set out in Note 8 to 
the financial statements and described more fully in the 
Corporate Governance report. 
Remuneration philosophy
Executive remuneration
The Company’s policy is to ensure that the Board and key 
management personnel are fairly rewarded with regard to 
responsibilities undertaken taking into account appropriate 
market practice.
Corporate and individual performance is taken into account in 
setting the pay level for the Chief Executive as the sole 
Executive Director of the Company, and will be reviewed on an 
annual basis to ensure it remains appropriate. In addition, our 
policy is that base pay should represent 50-75% of total 
remuneration and be incremented annually based on 
performance, inflation and market rates. 
Annual Performance Linked Incentive plan
The Remuneration Committee has also put in place an Annual 
Performance Linked Incentive scheme where variable 
remuneration may be paid on fulfilment of a range of individual 
and corporate performance targets up to a maximum of 41.7% 
of base salary. The performance targets are grouped within 
four key performance areas:
managing the financial results and achievement of budgeted ¸ ¸
financial targets;
driving innovative manufacturing operations and marketing ¸ ¸
excellence;
the timely completion of projects and the integration of new ¸ ¸
assets; and 
providing leadership, governance and organisational ¸ ¸
development.
Within each area a number of indicators and metrics have been 
identified that are taken into account by the Remuneration 
Committee when determining the amount of Annual 
Performance Linked Incentive to be awarded. Essar Energy plc Annual report + accounts 2010

will continue until the Company’s first AGM. The details of the 
Board’s re-election are provided in the Directors’ report. The

Company’s registered office during normal business hours and 
at the AGM (for 15 minutes prior to and during the meeting).
The Chairman and the Vice Chairman are entitled to an annual

The Non-Executive Directors are each entitled to an annual fee 
of £60,000 together with an additional fee of £15,000 per 
annum for chairing a Board Committee or alternatively £10,000 
per annum for serving on a Board Committee. 
The Chairman and the Vice Chairman and Non-Executive 
Directors do not receive any additional payments from 
subsidiaries of the Company other than those noted above. 
Chief executive 
Naresh Nayyar is entitled to a salary of £682,870 per annum 
under his service agreement with Essar Energy Services 
(Mauritius) Limited. He is entitled to a cash payment equal to 
10% of his basic salary to provide for long term financial 
planning into retirement and to provide for any dependants  
in the event of his death, and private medical insurance. 
He is eligible to participate in an Annual Performance Linked 
Incentive scheme which provides a payment of up to £284,530 
(at stretch level) subject to the achievement of certain 
performance targets relating to corporate and personal 
performance (with £227,624 for achieving target performance). 
No payments have been made under the Annual Performance 
Linked Incentive scheme in 2010, as the Company has not yet 
completed its first 12 months of operations. In accordance with 
employment laws in Mauritius, Naresh Nayyar has received a 
bonus of £46,948 equivalent to one month of his base salary 
from Essar Energy Services (Mauritius) Limited during the year. 
Mr Nayyar is also eligible to participate in the Essar Energy 
ESOP, for which he has been granted an option to acquire up 
to a maximum of 204,444 shares ordinary shares of 5 pence at 
an exercise price of 523 pence.

As indicated on IPO it was the Remuneration Committee’s 
intention to grant options to key executives under the ESOP 
shortly following IPO at around the Listing price of 420 pence. 
The Remuneration Committee was unable to make these 
option grants until 15 November 2010, but the market price of 
the Company’s shares rose strongly in the intervening period. 
In order to ensure the Chief Executive and key management 
personnel were not disadvantaged by the delay in granting 
options to them, the Remuneration Committee awarded each 
individual concerned an additional cash right. This right is 
exercisable in conjunction with or in place of the share option, 
depending on the share price at exercise. The salary multiple 
used in determining the number of shares under these options 
has been calculated by reference to the 420 pence listing price, 
not the share price shortly before the grant date.
The Remuneration Committee indicated on IPO that the grant 
of options to Mr Nayyar would be based on a value equal to 
100% of his annual base pay under his service agreement with 
Essar Energy Services (Mauritius) Limited (£682,870). However, 
the Remuneration Committee considered his contribution in 
bringing the Company to Listing and determined that the award 
should be based on his total annual base pay under his service 
agreements with both Essar Energy Services (Mauritius) 
Limited and Essar Oil Limited. 
Mr Nayyar’s service agreement is terminable by either party on 
service of six months prior written notice. The Company has 
the ability to terminate the agreement by the payment of a cash 
sum in lieu of notice equal to the salary and other contractual 
benefits, excluding bonus, payable for any unexpired portion  
of the notice period. 
Remuneration report continued
The payment in lieu of notice shall be paid within one month  
of the date of termination of the Executive’s employment or  
in equal instalments from the date of termination of the 
Executive’s employment until the relevant period. The payout 
shall be paid net of tax and subject to such deductions as may 
be required by law. Mr Nayyar is subject to a confidentiality 
undertaking without limitation in time and to non-competition, 
non-solicitation, non-dealing and non-hiring restrictive 
covenants for a period of 12 months after the termination  
of his employment.
In addition to his duties as Chief Executive, Mr Nayyar has 
continued to undertake his role as Managing Director of Essar 
Oil. Under this service agreement he is entitled to fixed pay of 
Rs. 12,840,000 (approximately £184,000) per annum and is 
eligible to receive a payment of up to Rs. 4,012,000 
(approximately £57,502) at 125% stretch level under the Annual 
Performance Linked Incentive Scheme subject to achievement

statement of Directors’ responsibilities
The Directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report 
and the financial statements in accordance with applicable law 
and regulations.
Company law requires the Directors to prepare financial 
statements for each financial year. Under that law the Directors 
are required to prepare the Group financial statements in 
accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards 
(‘IFRS’) as adopted by the European Union and Article 4 of the 
IAS Regulation and have also chosen to prepare the Company 
financial statements under IFRS as adopted by the EU. Under 
Company law the Directors must not approve the accounts 
unless they are satisfied that they give a true and fair view of 
the state of affairs of the Company and of the profit or loss of 
the Company for that period. In preparing these financial 
statements, International Accounting Standard 1 requires that 
Directors:
properly select and apply accounting policies; ¸ ¸
present information, including accounting policies, in a ¸ ¸
manner that provides relevant, reliable, comparable and 
understandable information; 
provide additional disclosures when compliance with the ¸ ¸
specific requirements in IFRSs are insufficient to enable 
users to understand the impact of particular transactions, 
other events and conditions on the entity’s financial position 
and financial performance; and
make an assessment of the Company’s ability to continue as ¸ ¸
a going concern.
The Directors are responsible for keeping adequate  
accounting records that are sufficient to show and explain  
the Company’s transactions and disclose with reasonable 
accuracy at any time the financial position of the Company and 
enable them to ensure that the financial statements comply 
with the Companies Act 2006. They are also responsible for 
safeguarding the assets of the Company and hence for taking 
reasonable steps for the prevention and detection of fraud and 
other irregularities.
The Directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity 
of the corporate and financial information included on the 
Company’s website. Legislation in the United Kingdom 
governing the preparation and dissemination of financial 
statements may differ from legislation in other jurisdictions.
r esponsibility statement 
We confirm that to the best of our knowledge:
the financial statements, prepared in accordance with IFRS, ¸ ¸
give a true and fair view of the assets, liabilities, financial 
position and profit of the Company and the undertakings 
included in the consolidation taken as a whole; and
the management report (entitled ‘Business review’), which is ¸ ¸
incorporated into the Directors’ report, includes a fair review 
of the development and performance of the business and 
the position of the Company and the undertakings included 
in the consolidation taken as a whole, together with a 
description of the principal risks and uncertainties that  
they face.

1. presentation of financial statements
1.1 Corporate information
Essar Energy plc (the ‘Company’) is a public limited Company incorporated in the United Kingdom. The address of the registered 
office is 3rd Floor, Lansdowne House, Berkeley Square, London, W1J 6ER and its head office is 6th Floor, DCDM Building 10, 
Frere Felix Valois Street, Port Louis, Mauritius.
The Company was incorporated in the UK on 18 December 2009 as a wholly owned subsidiary of Essar Global Limited (‘EGL ’ or 
‘Parent Company’). 
Between 18 December 2009 and 7 May 2010, the Company was party to a series of transactions with other EGL group 
companies whereby it acquired control of the Refining and Marketing, Exploration and Production, and Power businesses of EGL 
prior to IPO.
The consolidated financial statements of the Company comprise the Company and its subsidiaries (together referred to as the 
‘Group’) and the Group’s interest in joint ventures and associates.
The nature of the Group’s operations and its principal activities are set out in Note 29.
1.2 basis of preparation
The consolidated financial statements presented in this report have been prepared in accordance with International Financial 
Reporting Standards (‘IFRSs’) as adopted by the European Union, IFRIC interpretations and the Companies Act applicable to 
companies reporting under IFRS. The consolidated financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention 
as modified by the revaluation of available-for-sale assets, and financial assets and liabilities. 
The Group was formed under a series of transactions with entities under the same control as the Company, referred to as 
common control transactions. The Group’s policy is to prepare its consolidated financial statements using merger accounting 
principles, as if the transactions giving rise to the formation of the Group took place at the beginning of the comparative period.
Under these principles, the consolidated financial statements have been prepared as if the Company were the holding Company 
of EGL ’s Refining and Marketing, Exploration and Production, and Power businesses from 1 January 2009, the date of the 
beginning of the comparative period. The Group has consolidated its subsidiaries from this date. Once control was obtained, 
further acquisitions of non-controlling interests have been dealt with through reserves.
Businesses which were transferred out of the ownership of the Group’s subsidiaries to entities held under common control have 
been excluded from the consolidated financial statements.
The assets, liabilities and the profit or loss of the entities comprising the Group have been consolidated and all transactions and 
balances between entities included within the Group consolidation have been eliminated.
Invested capital reflected the aggregated equity of the Refining and Marketing, Exploration and Production, and Power 
businesses, prior to the formation of the Group. At the point at which the Company became the parent company of the Group,  
the Group’s equity reflected the share capital and share premium of the Company, together with other reserves arising on 
consolidation as shown in the statement of changes in equity and Note 21. 
The non-controlling interests in the Group’s subsidiary undertakings reduce throughout the period presented as a result of 
acquisitions by the Group of further investments in these subsidiaries.
Note 10 sets out how the Group has applied these principles in establishing its earnings per share.
EGL remains the ultimate Parent Company of the Group and its controlling party. The ultimate shareholders of EGL are the  
Virgo Trust and the Triton Trust, discretionary trusts whose beneficiaries include, among others, companies whose controlling 
shareholders are Mr Ravi Ruia and Mr Prashant Ruia who are Directors of Essar Energy plc.
The Group’s business activities, together with the factors likely to affect its future development, performance and position are set 
out in the Business review. The Business review also includes a summary of the Group’s financial position, its cash flows and 
borrowing facilities.
1.3 Going concern
The consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis. This is discussed in the Financial review 
section of the annual report.

1.4 Adoption of new and revised standards
In the current year, the following new and revised standards and interpretations have been adopted by the Group, none of which 
had a material impact on the current or prior year reported results and the financial position: 
IAS 1 (amended)/IAS 27 (amended)/IAS 31 (amended), Cost of an Investment in a Subsidiary, Jointly Controlled Entity or ¸ ¸
Associate;
IFRS 2 (amended), Share-based Payment – Vesting Conditions and Cancellations and Group Cash-settled Share-based ¸ ¸
Payment Transactions;
IFRS 3 (revised 2008), Business Combinations; ¸ ¸
IAS 17 (amendment), Leases; ¸ ¸
IAS 27 (revised 2008), Consolidated and Separate Financial Statements; ¸ ¸
IAS 28 (revised 2008), Investments in Associates; ¸ ¸
IAS 39 (amended), Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement: Eligible Hedged Items; ¸ ¸
IAS 39 (amended) and IFRIC 9, Embedded Derivatives; ¸ ¸
IFRIC 17, Distributions of Non-cash Assets to Owners; ¸ ¸
IFRIC 18, Transfer of Assets from Customers; and ¸ ¸
Improvements to IFRSs (April 2009). ¸ ¸
1.5 Standards, interpretations and amendments to published standards that are not yet effective
At the date of authorisation of these financial statements, the following Standards and Interpretations which have not been applied 
in these financial statements were in issue but not yet effective (and in some cases had not yet been adopted by the EU):
IFRS 9, Financial Instruments; ¸ ¸
IAS 24 (amended), Related Party Disclosures; ¸ ¸
IAS 32 (amended), Classification of Rights Issues; ¸ ¸
IFRIC 19, Extinguishing Financial Liabilities with Equity Instruments; ¸ ¸
IFRIC 14 (amended), Repayments of a Minimum Funding Requirement; ¸ ¸
IFRS 7 (amended), Financial Instruments: Disclosures; and ¸ ¸
Improvements to IFRSs (May 2010). ¸ ¸
The adoption of IFRS 9, which the Group expects will be applicable for the year beginning on 1 January 2013, will impact both  
the measurement and disclosure of Financial Instruments. The Directors do not expect that the adoption of other standards listed 
above will have a material impact on the financial statements of the Group in future periods. 
2. Accounting policies and estimates
2.1 Significant accounting policies
2.1.1 Business combinations
The acquisition of subsidiaries and businesses from third parties are accounted for using the purchase method. The cost of 
acquisition is measured at the aggregate value of the identifiable assets, liabilities incurred or assumed and equity instruments 
issued by the Group on the basis of fair value at the date of acquisition in exchange for control of the acquiree, plus cost directly 
attributable to the acquisition, except for a business combination under common control which is described below. The acquiree’s 
identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities that meet the conditions for recognition under IFRS 3 (revised 2008) Business 
Combinations are recognised at their fair value at the date of acquisition, except for non-current assets that are classified as held 
for sale in accordance with IFRS 5 Non-Current Assets held for sale and discontinued operations which are recognised at fair 
value less costs to sell. 
Where it is not possible to complete the determination of fair values by the date on which the first post-acquisition financial 
statements are approved, a provisional assessment of fair values is made and any adjustments required to those provisional fair 
values, and the corresponding adjustments to purchased goodwill, are finalised within twelve months of the acquisition date. 
Goodwill arising on acquisition is recognised as an asset and is initially measured at cost, being the excess of the cost of the 
purchase consideration over the Group’s interest in the net fair value of the identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities 
recognised. If, after reassessment, the fair values of the identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities exceeds the cost of 
acquisition, the excess is recognised immediately in profit or loss. 
Goodwill is subsequently measured at cost less any accumulated impairment losses. Goodwill that is recognised as an asset and 
is initially measured at cost, is reviewed for impairment at least annually. Any impairment is recognised immediately in profit or loss 
and is not subsequently reversed. Internally generated goodwill is not recognised. 
The interest of non-controlling shareholders in the acquiree is initially measured at the non-controlling shareholder’s proportion of 
the net fair value of the assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities recognised and subsequently also includes the non-controlling 
shareholder’s proportion of changes in equity since the date of combination. 
The Group follows the entity concept method of accounting for changes in ownership interest in subsidiaries. In the event of a 
purchase of a minority shareholder’s interest where the Group holds the majority of shares of a subsidiary, any excess over the 
Group’s share of net assets is recorded in retained earnings.

2. Accounting policies and estimates continued
Common control acquisitions
The assets and liabilities of subsidiaries acquired from entities under common control are recorded at the carrying value 
recognised by the transferor. Any differences between the carrying value of the net assets of subsidiaries acquired, and the 
consideration paid by the Group is accounted for as an adjustment to retained earnings. When the transferor contributes the 
subsidiaries to the Group, the original cost paid by the transferor is recorded as capital investment with the differences recorded 
as an increase in retained earnings. The net assets of the subsidiaries and their results are recognised from the date on which 
control of the subsidiaries was obtained by the transferor. 
2.1.2 Goodwill
Goodwill arising on consolidation represents the excess of the cost of acquisition over the Group’s interest in the fair value of the 
identifiable assets and liabilities of a subsidiary, associate or joint controlled entity at the date of acquisition. Goodwill is initially 
recognised as an asset at cost and is subsequently measured at cost less any accumulated impairment losses. Goodwill which is 
recognised as an asset is reviewed for impairment at least annually. Any impairment is recognised immediately in profit or loss and 
is not subsequently reversed. 
For the purpose of impairment testing goodwill is allocated to each of the Group’s cash generating units expected to benefit from 
the synergies of the combination. Cash generating units to which goodwill has been allocated are tested for impairment annually, 
or more frequently when there is an indication that the unit may be impaired. If the recoverable amount of the cash generating unit 
is less than the carrying amount of the unit, the impairment loss is allocated first to reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill 
allocated to the unit and then to the other assets of the unit pro-rata on the basis of the carrying amount of each asset in the unit. 
On disposal of a subsidiary, associate or joint controlled entity, the attributable amount of goodwill is included in the determination 
of the profit or loss on disposal.
2.1.3 Revenue recognition
Revenue from the sale of petroleum products is measured at the fair value of consideration received or receivable, net of trade 
discounts, volume rebates, value added tax, sales taxes and duties. A sale is recognised when economic benefits associated with 
the sale are expected to flow to the Group and the significant risks and rewards of ownership of the goods have passed and can 
be reliably measured. This is usually when title and insurance risk has passed to the customer. 
Revenue from power supply is accounted for on the basis of billings to consumers or unbilled supply of power. Generally all 
consumers are billed on the basis of recording of consumption of electricity by installed meters. Sales of electricity are accounted 
for based on relevant tariff rates approved under the contract with the customer.
Revenue associated with sales tax deferral is recognised in accordance with the Group’s policy for accounting for government 
grants set out in 2.1.4.
2.1.4 Sales tax incentives 
The Group receives the benefit of certain sales tax incentives under the Capital Investment Incentive Premier/Prestigious Units 
Scheme 1995–2000 (the ‘Sales Tax Incentive Scheme’). The benefits under the Sales Tax Incentive Scheme are recognised when 
it is reasonable to expect that the benefit will be received and that all related conditions will be met. The benefit of a sales tax 
deferral with no associated interest outflow is recognised as a liability in accordance with the imputation rule under IAS 20 
Accounting for Government grants and disclosure of Government Assistance. This deferred liability is measured in accordance 
with IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement. The benefit of the effective market rate of interest (or no interest) 
is measured as the difference between initial carrying value of the financial liability as determined in accordance with IAS 39 and 
the sales tax collected.
The benefits under the Sales Tax Incentive Scheme are available only when eligible domestic sales are made from the State of 
Gujarat and the sale is therefore treated as the key condition giving rise to the recognition of the benefit. It is expected that all other 
conditions related to the deferral of sales tax will be met and therefore the benefit is recognised as eligible domestic sales are 
made. The deferred liability to the State is recognised at its net present value, and therefore a finance charge is recorded as the 
discount on this liability unwinds. 
2.1.5 Foreign currency transactions and translation
Each entity in the Group determines its own functional currency and items included in the financial statements of each entity  
are measured using that functional currency. Transactions in currencies other than the functional currency are translated into 
functional currency at the exchange rates at the date of transaction. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in other 
currencies are translated into functional currency at exchange rates at the reporting date and exchange differences are  
recognised in profit or loss.
Non-monetary items that are measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are translated using the exchange rates  
as at the dates of the initial transactions. Essar Energy plc Annual report + accounts 2010

2. Accounting policies and estimates continued
The consolidated financial statements are presented in US dollars. For the purposes of consolidation, the income statement  
items of those entities for which the US dollar is not the functional currency are translated into US dollars at the average rates of 
exchange during the year. The related balance sheets are translated at the rates at the balance sheet date. Exchange differences 
arising on translation are reported in the consolidated statement of changes in equity.
The rates used to translate the consolidated financial statements were as follows:
For the year ended 31 December
2010 
Rs/$
2009 
Rs/$
Opening rates 46.68 48.45
Average rates 45.74 48.35
Closing rates 44.81 46.68
2.1.6 Derivative financial instruments
In order to reduce its exposure to foreign exchange, commodity price and interest rate risk, the Group enters into forward, option 
and swap contracts. The Group also enters into financial instruments to acquire non-controlling stakes of its subsidiaries to 
increase its stake. Additionally the Group provides warrants over stakes held in certain subsidiaries. The Group does not use 
derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes.
A derivative is presented as a non-current asset or liability if the remaining maturity of the instrument is more than 12 months and  
it is not expected to be realised or settled within 12 months. Other derivatives are presented as current assets or current liabilities.
At present, the Group’s derivative arrangements are not designated hedges under the definitions of IAS 39. Consequently, all fair 
value movements in respect of derivative financial instruments are taken to the income statement. Further details of derivative 
financial instruments including fair value measurements are disclosed in Note 20.
2.1.7 Property, plant and equipment
Property, plant and equipment is stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses, if any. The initial cost of  
an asset comprises its purchase price or construction cost, any costs directly attributable to bringing the asset into operation,  
the initial estimate of the decommissioning obligation, and for qualifying assets, borrowing costs if the recognition criteria are met. 
The cost of mining properties and leases, which include the cost of acquiring and developing mining properties and mineral rights, 
are capitalised as property, plant and equipment in the period in which such costs are incurred.
Costs directly related to construction, including costs and revenues arising from testing, specific financing costs and foreign 
exchange losses, are capitalised up to the point where the property, plant and equipment become operational. Property, plant 
and equipment become operational once all testing and trial runs are complete and it is ready for use in the manner management 
intended. Income from the sale of products as a result of testing and trial runs of a new asset are part of the directly attributable 
cost of assets and therefore deducted from the cost of the asset. The purchase price or construction cost is the aggregate 
amount paid and the fair value of any other consideration given to acquire the asset. The capitalised value of a finance lease is  
also included within property, plant and equipment. Likewise, when a major inspection or major maintenance is undertaken, its 
cost is recognised in the carrying amount of the plant and equipment as a replacement if the recognition criteria are satisfied.  
All other repairs and maintenance costs are recognised in the profit or loss as incurred.
Property, plant and equipment in the course of construction is carried at cost, less accumulated impairment losses, if any, and is 
not depreciated. 
An item of property, plant and equipment is derecognised upon disposal or when no future economic benefits are expected from 
its use or disposal. Any gain or loss arising on derecognition of the asset (calculated as the difference between the net disposal 
proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset) is included in profit or loss in the year the asset is derecognised. 
The asset’s residual values, useful lives and methods of depreciation are reviewed, and adjusted if appropriate, at each financial 
year end.
Depreciation of property, plant and equipment other than freehold land and properties under construction is calculated to write  
off the cost of the asset to its residual value using the straight line method or the written down value method or on a unit of 
production basis as appropriate, over its expected useful life. Depreciation begins when the assets become ready for use.

Mining properties Unit of production basis
Office equipment and fixtures Straight line 3-20
Motor vehicles Written down value 9-11
Property, plant and equipment held under finance leases are depreciated over the shorter of lease term and estimated useful life.
2.1.8 Impairment of non-financial assets 
The carrying amounts of property, plant and equipment, including producing properties and leases, intangible asset (excluding 
goodwill) and investments in joint controlled entities are reviewed for impairment at each balance sheet date if events or changes 
in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable. Where it is not possible to estimate the 
recoverable amount of an individual asset, the Group estimates the recoverable amount of the cash generating unit to which  
the asset belongs. If there are indicators of impairment, an assessment is made to determine whether the asset’s carrying value 
exceeds its recoverable amount. Whenever the carrying value of an asset exceeds its recoverable amount, the carrying value  
of the asset or the cash generating unit is reduced to its recoverable amount and impairment loss is recognised in profit or loss. 
An asset’s recoverable amount is the higher of an asset’s or cash generating unit’s fair value less costs to sell and its value in use. 
In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that 
reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset. 
Where an impairment loss subsequently reverses, the carrying amount of the asset (or cash generating unit) is increased to the 
revised estimate of its recoverable amount, but such that the increased carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount 
that would have been determined had no impairment loss been recognised for the asset (or cash generating unit) in prior years.  
A reversal of an impairment loss is recognised immediately in profit or loss.
2.1.9 Borrowing costs
Borrowing costs directly relating to the acquisition, construction or production of qualifying assets are added to the costs of those 
assets during the construction phase on an effective interest basis, until such time as the assets are ready for their intended use or 
sale which, in the case of producing or mining properties, is when saleable material begins to be extracted from such properties. 
Where surplus funds are available for a short term out of money borrowed specifically to finance a qualified asset, the income 
generated from such short term investments is deducted from capitalised borrowing costs. 
All other borrowing costs are recognised in profit or loss in the period in which they are incurred.
2.1.10 Leases
The determination of whether an arrangement is, or contains a lease is based on the substance of the arrangement at inception 
date of whether the fulfilment of the arrangement is dependent on the use of a specific asset or assets or the arrangement 
conveys a right to use the asset.
Assets held under finance leases are initially recognised as assets of the Group at the inception of the lease at the fair value of the 
leased property or, if lower, at the present value of the minimum lease payments. Lease payments are apportioned between the 
finance charges and reduction of the lease liability so as to achieve a constant rate of interest on the remaining balance of the 
liability. Finance charges are recognised in the income statement, unless they are directly attributable to qualifying assets, in which 
case they are capitalised in accordance with the Group’s policy on borrowing costs (see above). 
Capitalised leased assets are depreciated over the shorter of the estimated useful life of the asset and the lease term, if there is no 
reasonable certainty that the Group will obtain ownership by the end of the lease term.
Payments made under operating leases, where the lessors effectively retain substantially all the risk and benefits of ownership of 
the lease property, plant and equipment are recognised in the income statement on a straight line basis over the lease term. Lease 
incentives received are recognised as an integral part of the total lease expense over the term of the lease. Property, plant and 
equipment used by the Group under operating leases are not recognised in the Group’s balance sheet. Essar Energy plc Annual report + accounts 2010

2. Accounting policies and estimates continued
2.1.11 Financial assets
All financial assets are recognised and derecognised on a trade date where the purchase or sale of a financial asset is under a 
contract whose terms require delivery of the financial asset within the timeframe established by the market concerned, and are 
initially measured at fair value, plus transaction costs, except for those financial assets classified as at Fair Value Through Profit  
or Loss (‘FVTPL ’), which are initially measured at fair value. 
The Group classifies its financial assets into the following specified categories; at FVTPL, cash and cash equivalents, loans  
and receivables and Available-for-sale (‘AFS’) financial assets. The classification is dependent on the nature and purpose of the 
financial assets acquired. Management determines the classification of its financial assets at initial recognition. Further details  
on the Group’s financial assets and fair value measurement are disclosed in Note 24.
Financial assets at FVTPL
Financial assets at FVTPL include financial assets held for trading or designated upon initial recognition as at FVTPL. Financial 
assets at FVTPL are stated at fair value, with any resultant gain or loss recognised in profit or loss. 
Financial assets are classified as held for trading if:
acquired principally for the purpose of selling in the near term; ¸ ¸
they are a part of an identified portfolio of financial instruments that the Group manages together and has a recent actual ¸ ¸
pattern of short-term profit-taking; or
they are derivatives unless these are designated as effective hedging instruments. ¸ ¸
A financial asset other than a financial asset held for trading may be designated as at FVTPL upon initial recognition if:
such designation eliminates or significantly reduces a measurement or recognition inconsistency that would otherwise arise; ¸ ¸
the financial asset forms part of a Group of financial assets or financial liabilities or both, which is managed and its performance ¸ ¸
is evaluated on a fair value basis, in accordance with the Group’s documented risk management or investment strategy, and 
information about the Grouping is provided internally on that basis; or
it forms part of a contract containing one or more embedded derivatives, and IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and ¸ ¸
Measurement permits the entire combined contract (asset or liability) to be designated as at FVTPL.
Financial assets at FVTPL are stated at fair value, with any gains or losses arising on remeasurement recognised in profit or loss. 
The net gain or loss recognised in profit or loss incorporates any dividend or interest earned on the financial asset and is included 
in the ‘other gains and losses’ line item in the income statement. Fair value is determined in the manner described in Note 24.
Loans and receivables
Loans and receivables are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an active 
market. After initial measurement loans and receivables are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method less 
any allowance for impairment. Interest income is recognised by applying effective interest rate, except for short term receivables 
when the recognition of interest would be immaterial. Gains and losses are recognised in profit or loss when the loans and 
receivables are derecognised or impaired as well as through the amortisation process.
AFS financial investments 
Listed shares held by the Group that are traded in an active market are classified as being AFS and are stated at fair value.  
The Group invests in unlisted shares that are not traded in an active market but classified as AFS financial investments and  
stated at fair value (because the Directors consider that fair value can be reliably measured). Fair value is determined in the  
manner described in Note 24. Gains and losses arising from changes in fair value are recognised in other comprehensive income 
and accumulated reserves with the exception of impairment losses, interest calculated using the effective interest method and 
foreign exchange gains and losses on monetary assets, which are recognised directly in profit or loss. Where the investment is 
disposed of or is determined to be impaired, the cumulative gain or loss previously recognised in the investments revaluation 
reserve is reclassified to profit or loss.
Dividends on AFS equity instruments are recognised in profit or loss when the Group’s right to receive the dividend is established. 
The fair value of AFS monetary assets denominated in a foreign currency is determined in that foreign currency and translated at 
the spot rate at the balance sheet date. The foreign exchange gains and losses that are recognised in profit or loss are determined 
based on the amortised cost of the monetary asset. Other foreign exchange gains and losses are recognised in other 
comprehensive income.
Impairment of financial assets 
Financial assets, other than those at FVTPL, are assessed for indicators of impairment at each balance sheet date. Financial 
assets are impaired where there is objective evidence that, as a result of one or more events that occurred after the initial 
recognition of the financial asset, the estimated future cash flows of the investment have been affected.
For financial assets carried at amortised cost the Group assesses whether objective evidence of impairment exists for assets that 
are individually significant, or collectively for financial assets that are not individually significant. Objective evidence of impairment 
could include:
significant financial difficulty of the issuer or counterparty; ¸ ¸
default or delinquency in interest or principal payments; or ¸ ¸
it becoming probable that the borrower will enter bankruptcy or financial reorganisation. ¸ ¸

2. Accounting policies and estimates continued
If there is objective evidence that an impairment loss has been incurred, the amount of the loss is measured as the difference 
between the assets carrying amount and the present value of estimated future cash flows (excluding future expected credit losses 
that have not yet been incurred). The present value of the estimated future cash flows is discounted at the financial assets original 
effective interest rate. If a loan has a variable interest rate, the discount rate for measuring any impairment loss is the current 
effective interest rate. The carrying amount of the asset is reduced through the use of an allowance account and the amount  
of the loss is recognised in the income statement.
For AFS financial investments, the Group assesses at each reporting date whether there is objective evidence that an investment 
or a Group of investments is impaired.
In the case of equity investments classified as AFS, objective evidence for impairment would include a significant or prolonged 
decline in the fair value of the investment below its cost. Where there is evidence of impairment, the cumulative loss (measured  
as the difference between the acquisition cost and the current fair value, less any impairment loss on that investment previously 
recognised in the income statement) is removed from other comprehensive income and recognised in the income statement. 
Impairment losses on equity investments are not reversed through the income statement; increases in their fair value after 
impairment are recognised directly in other comprehensive income.
2.1.12 Financial liabilities 
Financial liabilities are classified as financial liabilities at FVTPL or other financial liabilities at initial recognition. The Group’s other 
financial liabilities include borrowings, trade and other payables and finance lease payables. All financial liabilities are recognised 
initially at fair value and in the case of loans and borrowings, include directly attributable transaction costs.
The measurement of financial liabilities depends on their classification as follows:
Financial liabilities at FVTPL
Financial liabilities at FVTPL include those held for trading and financial liabilities designated upon initial recognition as at fair value 
through profit or loss. Financial liabilities are classified as held for trading if they are acquired for the purpose of selling in the near 
term. Gains or losses on liabilities held for trading are recognised in the income statement.
Other financial liabilities
Other financial liabilities, including borrowings, are initially measured at fair value, net of transaction costs. Other financial liabilities 
are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method, with interest expense recognised on an 
effective yield basis. The effective interest method is a method of calculating the amortised cost of a financial liability and of 
allocating interest expense over the relevant period. The effective interest rate is the rate that exactly discounts estimated future 
cash payments through the expected life of the financial liability, or, where appropriate, a shorter period, to the net carrying 
amount on initial recognition. Gains and losses are recognised in the income statement when the liabilities are derecognised as 
well as through the amortisation process.
Financial guarantee contracts
The Group provides certain guarantees in respect of the indebtedness of subsidiary undertakings, claims under contract and 
other arrangements in the ordinary course of business. The Group evaluates each arrangement to determine whether it is an 
insurance or a financial guarantee contract. Financial guarantee contract liabilities are measured initially at their fair values and,  
if not designated as at FVTPL, are subsequently measured at the higher of the amount of the obligation under the contract  
and the amount initially recognised less cumulative amortisation over period of guarantee is provided. 
Once the arrangements are designated as insurance contracts, these are disclosed as contingent liabilities unless the obligations 
under guarantee become probable. 
Derecognition of financial liabilities
The Group derecognises financial liabilities when, and only when, the Group’s obligations are discharged, cancelled or expire.
2.1.13 Provisions and contingencies
Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation, as a result of past events, and it is 
probable that an outflow of resources, that can reliably be estimated, will be required to settle such an obligation. If the effect  
of the time value of money is material, provisions are determined by discounting the expected future cash flows to net present 
value using an appropriate pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and, where 
appropriate, the risks specific to the liability. Unwinding of the discount is recognised in the income statement as a finance cost. 
Provisions are reviewed at each balance sheet date and are adjusted to reflect the current best estimate.
A contingent liability is disclosed where the existence of an obligation will only be confirmed by future events or where the amount 
of the obligation cannot be measured reliably. Contingent assets are not recognised, but are disclosed where an inflow of 
economic benefits is probable.
In normal course of business, contingent liabilities may arise from litigation and other claims against the Group. Essar Energy plc Annual report + accounts 2010

2. Accounting policies and estimates continued
2.1.14 Inventories
Inventories (other than crude oil extracted by the Exploration and Production segment) are valued at lower of cost and net 
realisable value. Crude oil extracted and in saleable condition is valued at net realisable value.
Cost is determined on the following bases:
raw materials and consumables are determined at weighted average cost except crude oil for the refinery which is measured  ¸ ¸
at first-in first-out basis. 
finished products and work in progress are determined at direct material cost, labour cost and a proportion of manufacturing ¸ ¸
overheads based on normal or allocated capacity. 
inventories held for trading purposes are determined at weighted average cost. ¸ ¸
Net realisable value is determined by reference to estimated prices existing at the balance sheet date for inventories less all 
estimated costs of completion and costs necessary to make the sale.
2.1.15 Intangible assets
Intangible assets acquired separately are measured on initial recognition at cost. The cost of intangible assets acquired in a 
business combination is fair value as at the date of acquisition. Following initial recognition, intangible assets are carried at cost 
less accumulated amortisation and accumulated impairment losses, if any.
Intangible assets with finite lives are amortised over their useful lives and assessed for impairment whenever there is an indication 
that an intangible asset may be impaired. The asset’s useful lives and methods of amortisation are reviewed, and adjusted if 
appropriate, at each financial year end.
Gains or losses arising from derecognition of an intangible asset are measured as the difference between the net disposal 
proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset and are recognised in profit or loss when the asset is derecognised.
Intangible assets with finite lives which are subject to amortisation are amortised over their useful lives as mentioned below:
Intangible asset
expected 
useful life 
(years)
Software 3-5
Power sales contract 20
2.1.16 Joint controlled entities
A joint controlled entity is an entity in which the Group shares joint control over the strategic, financial and operating decisions with 
one or more ventures under a contractual arrangement.
Investment in joint controlled entities are accounted for using the equity method of accounting, except when the investment is 
classified as held for sale, which is recognised at fair value less costs to sell. In accordance with the equity method, investments  
in joint controlled entities are measured at cost plus post acquisition changes in the Group’s share of net assets of joint controlled 
entities, less any impairment in the value of individual investments.
Goodwill arising from the excess of the cost of acquisition over the Group’s interest in the net fair value of the identifiable assets, 
liabilities and contingent liabilities recognised of the joint controlled entities is included in the carrying amount of the investment 
and is assessed for impairment as part of that investment. Any excess of the Group’s share of the net fair value of the identifiable 
assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities over the cost of acquisition, after reassessment, is recognised immediately in profit  
or loss. 
The income statement reflects share of results of operations of the joint controlled entities. Where there has been a change 
recognised directly in equity of the joint controlled entities, the Group recognises its share of any changes, when applicable,  
in the statement of changes in equity. Profits and losses resulting from transactions between the Group and the joint controlled 
entities are eliminated to the extent of the Group’s interest in the relevant joint controlled entities.
2.1.17 Exploration and evaluation expenditure
Exploration and evaluation activity involves the search for oil and gas resources, the determination of technical feasibility and the 
assessment of commercial viability of an identified resource.
Exploration and evaluation activity includes:
researching and analysing historical exploration data; ¸ ¸
gathering exploration data through geological and geophysical studies; ¸ ¸
exploratory and appraisal drilling; ¸ ¸
evaluating and testing discoveries; ¸ ¸
determining transportation and infrastructure requirements; and ¸ ¸
conducting market and finance studies. ¸ ¸

2. Accounting policies and estimates continued
Administration costs that are not directly attributable to a specific exploration area are charged to the profit and loss account. 
License costs paid in connection with a right to explore an existing exploration area are capitalised. Exploration and evaluation 
expenditure (including amortisation of capitalised license costs) is charged to the profit and loss account as incurred except in the 
following circumstances:
the exploration and evaluation activity is related to an established discovery for which commercially recoverable reserves have ¸ ¸
already been established; or
at the balance sheet date, exploration and evaluation activity has not reached a stage which permits a reasonable assessment ¸ ¸
of the existence of commercially recoverable reserves.
Capitalised exploration and evaluation expenditure considered to be tangible is recorded as a component of property, plant and 
equipment at cost less impairment losses, if any. All capitalised exploration and evaluation expenditure is monitored for indicators 
of impairment. Where a potential impairment is indicated, an impairment test of the capitalised exploration and evaluation 
expenditure is performed for each area of interest in conjunction with the Group or pool of operating assets (representing a cash 
generating unit) to which the exploration is attributed. To the extent that capitalised expenditure is not expected to be recovered it 
is charged to the profit and loss account. Exploration areas at which reserves have been discovered but that require major capital 
expenditure before production can begin are continually evaluated to ensure that commercial quantities of reserves exist or to 
ensure that additional exploration or evaluation work is under way or planned.
2.1.18 Development expenditure
When commercially recoverable reserves are determined and development is sanctioned, the capitalised exploration and 
evaluation expenditure is transferred to assets under construction after impairment is assessed and any resulting impairment loss 
is recognised. Expenditure on the construction, installation or completion of infrastructure facilities such as platforms, pipelines 
and the drilling of development wells are capitalised as assets under construction. 
On completion of a development, all capitalised exploration and evaluation expenditure together with the subsequent development 
expenditure transferred to producing properties are depreciated using unit of production method. This is carried out with reference 
to quantities, with depletion computed on the basis of the ratio that oil and gas production bears to balance proved and probable 
reserves at commencement of the year.
2.1.19 Tax 
Tax expense represents the sum of current tax and deferred tax.
Current tax is provided on taxable income at amounts expected to be paid or recovered, using the tax rates and laws that have 
been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is provided, using the balance sheet method, on all temporary differences at the balance sheet date between the tax 
bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts for financial reporting purposes.
In India, the current tax payable by a company is charged to the income statement in the applicable period at the corporate tax 
rate computed under the normal provisions of the Indian Income Tax Act or the minimum alternate tax (MAT), whichever is higher. 
Excess paid under MAT can be carried forward for up to 10 years as a credit against corporate income tax in the future. Where 
the MAT credit satisfies the relevant criteria under IAS 12 Income Taxes, it is recognised as a deferred tax asset.
Deferred tax is recognised for all taxable temporary differences, except:
where the deferred tax arises from the initial recognition of goodwill or of an asset or liability in a transaction that is not  ¸ ¸
a business combination and, at the time of the transaction, affects neither the accounting nor taxable profit or loss; and
in respect of taxable temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries and interests in joint controlled entities, ¸ ¸
where the timing of the reversal of the temporary differences can be controlled and it is probable that the temporary differences 
will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
Deferred tax assets are recognised for all deductible temporary differences, unused tax credits carried forward and unused  
tax losses, to the extent that it is probable that sufficient taxable profit will be available to allow all or part of the assets to be 
recovered. The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each balance sheet date and is adjusted to the extent  
that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profit will be available to allow all or part of the asset to be recovered.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured at the tax rates that are expected to apply to the year when the asset will be 
realised or the liability will be settled, based on tax rates and tax laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the 
balance sheet date. Unrecognised deferred income tax assets are reassessed at each balance sheet date and are recognised  
to the extent that it has become probable that future taxable profit will allow the deferred tax asset to be recovered.
Current and deferred tax are recognised as an expense or income in the income statement, except when they relate to items 
credited or debited directly to equity, in which case the tax is also recognised directly in equity, or where they arise from the initial 
accounting for a business combination. In the case of a business combination, the tax effect is taken into account in calculating 
goodwill or in determining the excess of the acquirer’s interest in the net fair value of the acquiree’s identifiable assets, liabilities 
and contingent liabilities over the cost of the business combination. Essar Energy plc Annual report + accounts 2010

2. Accounting policies and estimates continued
Deferred income tax assets and deferred income tax liabilities are offset if a legally enforceable right exists to set off current  
tax assets against current income tax liabilities and the deferred income taxes relate to the same taxable entity and the same  
tax authority.
2.1.20 Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash at bank and in hand, short term deposits with banks with original maturity of less than 
90 days and short term highly liquid investments, that are readily convertible into cash and which are subject to insignificant risk of 
changes in the principal amount. Bank overdrafts, which are repayable on demand and form an integral part of the operations are 
included in cash and cash equivalents.
2.1.21 Retirement benefits
The Group operates both defined benefit and defined contribution schemes for its employees as well as post employment benefit 
plans. For defined contribution schemes the amount charged as expense is the contributions paid or payable when employees 
have rendered services entitling them to the contributions.
For defined benefit pension and post employment benefit plans, full actuarial valuations are carried out every year end using the 
projected unit credit method. Actuarial gains and losses arising during the year are recognised in profit and loss account.
Past service cost is recognised immediately to the extent that the benefits are already vested and otherwise is amortised on a 
straight line basis over the average period until the benefits become vested.
The employee benefit obligation recognised in the balance sheet represents the present value of the defined benefit obligation as 
reduced by the fair value of the related plan assets. Any asset resulting from this calculation is limited to the reductions in future 
contributions to the plan. 
Detailed disclosures are not provided within the financial statements as amounts associated with such schemes are not 
considered to be significant.
2.1.22 Share based payments
The cost of granting share options and other share-based remuneration is recognised in the income statement at their fair value  
at grant date. They are expensed straight-line over the vesting period, based on estimates of the shares or options that will

Black-Scholes model. 
During 2010 the Company granted options to the Executive Director and certain members of the Essar Energy senior management 
team to purchase shares under the Employee Share Option Plan (‘ESOP’). Details of the scheme and its performance criteria are 
set out in the Remuneration report. The total charge in the year relating to the scheme was US$45,506, which is not considered  
to be significant to the Group’s results and therefore no further disclosures have been provided within the financial statements.
2.1.23 IPO costs
Incremental directly attributable costs incurred on issue of equity shares is offset against the share premium account in 
accordance with CA 2006 and IAS 23 Financial Instruments: Presentation.
2.2 Critical accounting judgments and key sources of estimation uncertainty
In the course of applying the policies set out in section 2.1 above, management have made estimations and assumptions that 
impact the amounts recognised in the consolidated financial statements and related disclosures. Several of these estimates and 
judgments are related to matters that are inherently uncertain as they pertain to future events. These estimates and judgments  
are evaluated at each reporting date and are based on historical experience, internal controls, advice from external experts and 
other factors, including expectations of future events that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. The resulting 
accounting estimates may vary from the actual results. The Group believes that the assumptions, judgments and estimations that 
have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial 
period are the following areas:
2.2.1 Sales tax benefit
The Group benefits from certain sales tax incentives given by the State of Gujarat provided if the sales are made from the  
State of Gujarat. Under these incentive schemes, the Group is able to defer the payment of up to approximately Rs. 91 billion 
(US$1.95 billion) collected as sales tax for eligible domestic sales made from the State of Gujarat until the financial year ending  
31 March 2021 (or earlier `if the full eligible limit is exhausted), after which it is required to repay the retained amounts of sales  
tax in six equal annual instalments. There are a number of conditions under which this benefit has been granted including:  
(i) ensuring that certain percentages of the employees are local people; (ii) re-investing certain amounts of the benefit;  
(iii) adhering to specified pollution control measures; and (iv) contributing a certain amount to the prescribed rural development 
scheme in the State of Gujarat. The Group recorded a benefit of US$292.6 million in the year ended 31 December 2010  
(2009: US$220.3 million). The majority of the benefit is expected to be earned over a period of five to seven years from the  
date on which the Vadinar refinery commenced commercial operations in 2008.

2. Accounting policies and estimates continued
The amount of benefit recorded is based on management’s expectation that it will begin repayments in 2021 and that it will 
comply with all the related conditions. This is based on the fact that management intends to comply with all such conditions,  
is able to control its compliance, and intends to monitor the sales to allow the Group to benefit from the maximum deferral  
period. Any change in this assessment would result in a change in the benefit that would be recorded in that period.
The Group has recorded the sales tax benefit as revenue in the period in which the associated eligible domestic sales are made  
to customers. Under IAS 20, the benefit may only be recognised when there is reasonable assurance that the entity will comply 
with the conditions attached to the benefit and must be recognised over the period necessary to match the benefit systematically 
with the related costs which they are intended to compensate. Recognition of the benefit in profit or loss on a receipts basis is 
appropriate only where no suitable basis exists for allocating the benefit to periods other than the one in which it is received.
Management has exercised its judgement in assessing the period over which to recognise the benefit and believes there are  
no significant costs or expenses that the incentive is intended to compensate, as the plant’s location was determined before  
the incentive became available and as this incentive was set up, amongst other things, to improve the economic wellbeing  
of the State of Gujarat. Accordingly, the Group has recognised the benefit in the period of the eligible domestic sales made  
from the State of Gujarat, being the primary condition associated with the benefit. An alternative view would be that the sales  
tax benefit is intended to compensate recipients for the costs of setting up and/or conducting their business in the State of 
Gujarat, in which case the benefit could be recognised over the period necessary to match such costs. For example,  
a differing judgement may be to (a) recognise the benefit during the period in which the Company incurs operating  
expenses whilst it enjoys the benefit (for example, 13 years being the remaining period for which the sales tax payment  
can be deferred) or (b) recognise the benefit over the expected life of the capital asset constructed, namely the Vadinar  
refinery (the depreciation period for which is 40 years) both of which would result in materially different results in the  
periods presented with significantly lower revenue and profit.
Further, the Group’s eligibility to participate in the Scheme is being challenged by the State Government of Gujarat (see Note 27). 
2.2.2 Contingencies and commitments
In the normal course of business, contingent liabilities may arise from litigation and other claims against the Group. Potential 
liabilities that have a low probability of crystallising or are very difficult to quantify reliably, are treated as contingent liabilities. Such 
liabilities are disclosed in the notes but are not provided for in the consolidated financial statements. There can be no assurance 
regarding the final outcome of these legal proceedings, but the Group does not expect them to have a materially adverse impact 
on its financial position or profitability. For further details, refer to Note 27. 
2.2.3 Depreciable lives
The Group’s relevant non-current assets are depreciable over their estimated useful lives as set out in section 2.1 above. Such 
lives are dependent upon an assessment of both the technical lives of the assets and also their likely economic lives based on 
factors including commodity prices, alternative sources of supply, relative efficiency and operating costs. Accordingly depreciable 
lives are reviewed annually using the best information available to management. 
2.2.4 Impairment testing
Goodwill is tested for impairment annually. Other non-current assets are tested for impairment when conditions suggest that there 
is a risk of impairment. Where impairment testing is carried out, management use the best information available to them to assess 
the likely cash flows available to the relevant asset. Key assumptions are inherently uncertain and include commodity prices, 
anticipated production costs, likely asset lives, the timing of granting of licenses and permits and the relevant discount rates. 
2.2.5 Tax
The Group is subject to tax, principally within India. The amount of tax payable in respect of any period is dependent upon the 
interpretation of the relevant tax rules. Whilst an assessment must be made of the deferred tax position of each entity within the 
Group, these matters are inherently uncertain until the position of each entity is agreed with the relevant tax authorities. 
2.2.6 Exploration and evaluation expenditure
Exploration and evaluation expenditure are capitalised in accordance with the accounting policy in Note 2.1.17. In making a 
decision about whether to continue to capitalise exploration and evaluation expenditures, it is necessary to make judgements 
about the satisfaction of, if (a) proved reserves are booked or (b) (i) if they have found commercially producible quantities of 
reserves and (ii) if they are subject to further exploration or appraisal activity in that either drilling of additional exploratory wells is 
under way or firmly planned for the near future or other activities are being undertaken to sufficiently progress the assessing of 
reserves and the economic and operating viability of the project. If there is a change in one of these judgements in a subsequent 
period, then the related capitalised exploration and evaluation expenditures would be expensed in that period resulting in a charge 
to income. For further details, refer to Note 11. Essar Energy plc Annual report + accounts 2010

3. Segment information
Information reported to the Board for the purpose of resource allocation and assessment of performance is primarily determined 
by the nature of the different activities that the Group engages in, rather than the geographical location of these operations.  
This is reflected by the Group’s organisational structure and internal financial reporting systems. The profitability of the segments  
is reviewed based on profit or loss after tax and is based on IFRS. The Group has the following reportable operating segments:
Power: The Group operates gas and liquid fuel based power plants in India and Canada together with a number of mining ¸ ¸
assets. 
Exploration and Production: The Group has a diverse portfolio of 17 blocks for the exploration and production of oil and gas in ¸ ¸
India, Australia, Indonesia, Madagascar, Nigeria and Vietnam.
Refining and Marketing: The Group owns a petroleum refinery on the west coast of India, together with a 50% interest in a ¸ ¸
petroleum refinery in Kenya, and fuel retailing stations on franchise across India. Its main products are gasoil, motor spirit, fuel oil 
and superior kerosene oil. The activities of Refining and Marketing include the refining of crude oil and trading, marketing and 
transportation of finished products and by products. 
Centre: This comprises Essar Energy plc and its subsidiary companies that provides services to the Group as a whole. ¸ ¸

3. Segment information continued
Sales between the segments are made at contractually agreed prices. The segment revenues and segment results include 
transaction between business segments. All inter and intra transactions including all profit or loss made within these segments are 
eliminated on Group combination.
There is no comparative information for the centre as it did not exist in the comparative period. Material non-cash transaction in 
the periods presented include gifting of shares in subsidiaries by the Parent Company on reorganisation of the Group prior to IPO 
as described in Notes 2.1 and 21.
Three customers in the Refining and Marketing segment contributing revenues of US$2,414.5 million, US$1,512.5 million and 
US$1,309.9 million respectively accounted for approximately 52% of the Group’s net sales (2009: Three customers in the Refining 
and Marketing segment contributing revenues of US$1,820.9 million, US$1,152.1 million and US$1,172.8 million respectively 
accounted for approximately 59% of the Group’s net sales).

The sales tax benefit above relates to the benefit recognised on eligible domestic sales within the State of Gujarat from the Vadinar 
refinery. Under the incentive scheme, sales tax collected from customers within Gujarat is deferred for payment to the State of 
Gujarat by up to 17 years. This deferral gives rise to time value benefit as the difference between the cash received and the net 
present value of the liability to the State. The benefit is earned as the eligible domestic sales are made within the State of Gujarat 
as the benefit does not compensate the Group for any particular costs or expenses, and the Group expects all other conditions 
related to the benefit to be met in full. The benefit is included within revenue as it is derived directly from sales made to customers.

Borrowing costs capitalised during the year relate to interest ranging from 1.3% to 13.75% (2009: 1.0% to 14.5%) incurred on 
specific borrowings undertaken to finance construction of assets.
As sales tax is collected from customers, a corresponding liability to the State of Gujarat is recognised at its net present value. 
Accordingly, the discount on the liability unwinds over time resulting in the finance costs as shown above. In a related transaction, 
the Group has deposited amounts based on the net present value of its future sales tax payments with a related party. The 
interest accruing on these deposits of 9.0% (2009: 9.1%) per annum is included in finance income above.

The Group also has not recognised deferred tax assets of US$31.1 million (2009: US$7.1 million) in respect of credits for MAT 
which have not been recognised.
No deferred tax asset has been recognised for the above losses and credits on the grounds that it is not probable that suitable 
taxable profits will arise before the tax losses and credits expire. The recoverability of the unrecognised deferred tax asset will be 
reviewed at future balance sheet dates. 
The deferred tax liabilities for taxes that would be payable on the unremitted earnings of certain of the Group’s subsidiaries or joint 
controlled entities have not been recognised as:
(i) the Group has determined that undistributed profit of its subsidiaries will not be distributed in the foreseeable future, but rather 
tax-free returns of capital may be made if necessary; and
(ii) the Group’s joint controlled entities cannot distribute their profits without consent of all joint controlled entities partners.  
The Group does not foresee giving such consent at the balance sheet date. 
The temporary differences associated with investment in subsidiaries and joint controlled entities, for which deferred tax liabilities 
have not been recognised, as explained above, amount to US$166.0 million (2009: US$151.8 million).
10. earnings per share
Basic earnings per share is calculated by dividing profit after tax for the period attributable to ordinary equity holders of the 
Company by the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the period.
As noted in the basis of preparation in Note 1, the financial statements combine the results, assets and liabilities of the Refining 
and Marketing, Exploration and Production, and Power businesses acquired by the Company under the reorganisation prior to 
IPO. During the period, the holding companies of the Refining and Marketing, Exploration and Production, and Power businesses 
provided cash in exchange for equity in the underlying Group. To reflect this in earnings per share, the weighted average number 
of shares is calculated on the basis that this cash represented the acquisition of shares at the listing price of £4.20 per ordinary 
share throughout both the current and the comparative period presented.
The Company issued 999,999,980 fully paid shares to its Parent Company for a total of US$1,491.1 million in April 2010. At the 
date of Listing (7 May 2010) a further 303,030,302 shares were issued, and as part of the Listing there was a subsequent issue  
of 406,991 shares as an over-allotment option on 4 June 2010.
Since 1 January 2009 the cash and the related equivalent number of shares calculated as though issued at the listing price of 
£4.20 was as follows:
 Shares representing: Shares 
Invested capital as at 1 January 2009 884,541,083
Capital contributed in cash in 2009 of US$150.1 million 23,352,656
Invested capital at 1 January 2009 907,893,739
Capital contributed in cash in 2010 of US$593.2 million 92,106,261
Issued on IPO 303,437,293
Shares capital at 31 December 2010 1,303,437,293
The shares presented above reflect capital contributions made to the Group by its Parent Company prior to IPO in cash and  
are different to the amounts presented in the Consolidated Statement of Changes in Equity, which also include non-cash  
gifted investments.
The options issued as per the ESOP scheme in 2010 did not result in a significant dilutive potential impact.

In assessing whether goodwill has been impaired, the carrying amount of the cash generating unit (including goodwill) is 
compared with the recoverable amount of the cash generating unit. The recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs  
to sell and value in use. In the absence of any information about the fair value of a cash generating unit, the recoverable amount  
is deemed to be the value in use. The Group calculates the recoverable amount as the value in use using a discounted cash  
flow model. The future cash flows are adjusted for risks specific to the cash generating unit and are discounted using a pre-tax 
discount rate. The discount rate is derived from the applicable business segment weighted average cost of capital and is adjusted 
where applicable to take into account any specific risks relating to the country where the cash generating unit is located. 
Petroleum refinery 
The five-year business plans are used together with long term market expectations to estimate gross refining margins and  
other cash flows, which are approved on an annual basis by management, and are the primary source of information for the 
determination of value in use based on a discount factor of 11.43% p.a. (2009: 10.77% p.a.). The three-year business plans contain 
forecasts for refinery throughputs, sales volumes for various types of refined products, revenues, costs and capital expenditure. 
As an initial step in the preparation of these plans, various economic assumptions, such as oil prices, refining margins, refined 
product margins and cost inflation rates, are set by senior management. The estimated recoverable amount for the refinery unit 
exceeds its carrying amount in all periods.

12. Other intangible assets continued
Gross Refining Margin (‘GRM’) is the difference between revenue from refined petroleum products and related cost of crude oil 
used for their production. GRM is calculated based on market information and past experience of management. Prices of the 
petroleum products and crude are exposed to movement in crude prices on the Nymex, International Petroleum Exchange and 
Dubai Mercantile Exchange. If GRM falls by 26% (2009: 35%) compared to what is considered for impairment testing, Refinery 
Project’s recoverable amount would be equal to its carrying amount.
The discount rate is estimated based on the weighted average cost of the capital of Essar Oil Limited (‘EOL ’). If the discount rate 
increases by 42% (2009: 72%) above what is considered for impairment testing, Refinery Project’s recoverable amount would be 
equal to its carrying amount.
Power plants
The Group uses the long term power sale agreements for estimating the cash flows, which are approved based on signed 
contracts in place and are the primary source of information for the determination of value in use based on a discount factor of 
10.60% p.a. (2009: 11.02% p.a). These contain forecasts for plant load factor, generation in Megawatts (‘MW’), fixed and variable 
revenue, operating costs and sustaining capital expenditure. The cash flow projections are based on these forecasts which  
are approved by senior management. The estimated recoverable amount for the power plants significantly exceeds its carrying 
amount in all cases and no impairment is necessary at the end of periods presented. The sensitivity analysis described below  
in respect of key input assumptions used to assess impairment of goodwill is for information purposes only, and variation of  
such factors does not lead to a need for impairment.
Plant load factor is the generation capacity of the plant at a given point in time and is based on the demand from the customer 
with a direct impact on variable revenue. If plant load factor falls by 10%, the recoverable amount will decrease by US$21.0 million 
(2009: US$31.0 million). Similarly if plant load factor increases by 10%, then the recoverable amount of power plans will increase 
by US$14 million (2009: US$16 million). 
Discount rates reflect the current market assessment of the risks specific to each cash generating unit. The discount rate is 
estimated based on the weighted average cost of the capital of power entity. A 1% increase in discount rate reduces the 
recoverable amount by US$18.6 million (2009: US$23.5 million).

The Power business has not yet created a security in favour of certain debenture holders, whose debentures have a carrying value 
of US$44.6 million (2009: nil), in accordance to the related debenture trust deed. This default is not considered to be significant 
and related terms including the maturity profile remain unchanged. These amounts have been classified within current liabilities  
as at 31 December 2010.
bank and financial Institutions 
The Group has borrowings under various loan agreements with a number of banks and financial institutions. These lenders 
provide the Group with term loans, revolving facilities and letters of credit facilities. 
Borrowings from banks and financial institutions of US$1,658.0 million (2009: US$1,659.9 million) are subject to a master 
restructuring agreement (‘MRA’) entered into by EOL with the lenders on 17 December 2004, prior to its acquisition by the Group. 
The MRA provided EOL an option to make early repayments at any time over the term of borrowings. The interest rates ranging 
from 8% to 13% per annum are subject to variation on prepayment of any borrowings. Other loans held by the Group include  
an amount due to American Express Bank Limited (‘Amex’) of nil (2009: US$72.9 million) which were due to be separately 
restructured in line with MRA terms agreed by EOL. The Amex loan was repaid during the year.
Borrowings from banks and financial institutions are generally secured pari passu with other lenders of the borrowing company 
with a first charge on property, plant and equipment, followed by charges over current assets and pledges of certain equity shares 
in subsidiaries held by the Group. Working capital loans are secured by a first charge on the current assets and a second charge 
on property, plant and equipment.
Interest rates on Indian Rupee borrowings range from 8.0% to 14.5% per annum (2009: 8.0% to 14.5%) while the interest rate  
on borrowings in other currencies ranges from 0.9% to 3.3% per annum (2009: 1.0 % to 7.0%).
The Group has undrawn committed facilities as at 31 December 2010 of US$4,046.1 million (2009: US$2,487.1 million) with 
maturities ranging from 1 to 2 years. Details of the maturity and interest profile of the Group’s borrowings are included in Note 23.
Optionally Cumulative Redeemable preference Shares
Optionally Convertible Cumulative Redeemable Preference Shares (‘OCCRPS’) of a nominal value Rs. 3,500 million (US$68.2 million) 
were issued on 18 March 2009 by Essar Power Limited (‘EPOL ’), a subsidiary of the Group. The OCCRPS carry interest rate of 
0.1% and 8.0% per annum for the first two years and subsequent five years, respectively. The OCCRPS are convertible into equity 
shares at the option of the investor in the event of a covenant default or an IPO of Essar Power Limited. The conversion price will 
be determined based on the equity valuation of the subsidiary at the time of conversion. If there is no Qualified offering of EPOL, 
until the final redemption date, then the Preference shares will be redeemed at 14.5% to 20.5% interest per annum at the end of 
the original term based on valuation of EPOL. The Group has accounted the OCCRPS at amortised cost with effective interest rate 
of 20.8%.  Essar Energy plc Annual report + accounts 2010

18. borrowings continued
EPOL has also issued a warrant to the OCCRPS holder for a consideration of Rs. 100, which entitles the holder to subscribe  
to the equivalent of US$15.0 million of equity shares in EPOL at any time before an IPO of EPOL at an exercise price based on  
a predetermined valuation of EPOL. The OCCRPS continues to be held as long term borrowings. Refer to Note 20 for further 
information on the valuation of the warrant provided to the OCCRPS holder.
working Capital loans
The Group has a number of working capital loans which are used in the ordinary course of business which are subject to interest 
rates ranging from 1.0% to 13.75% per annum (2009: 1.0% to 12.25%) and are short term in nature.
bills of exchange
Bills of exchange are accepted by banks towards payment of customer invoices and typically carry an interest rate ranging from 
8.9% to 9.0% per annum (2009: 6.0% to 12.0%) and are settled in a period ranging from 7 to 21 days.
Loans from related parties

The fair values of derivative instruments are calculated using quoted prices. Where such prices are not available, a discounted 
cash flow analysis is performed using the applicable yield curve for the duration of the instruments for non-optional derivatives, 
and option pricing models for optional derivatives. Foreign currency forward contracts are measured using quoted forward 
exchange rates and yield curves derived from quoted interest rates matching maturities of the contracts. Commodity swaps are 
measured using a forward curve based on quoted futures or forward prices and yield curves derived from quoted interest rates 
matching maturities of the contracts. Commodity options are measured using the same data as the commodity swaps, but also 
uses a volatility surface derived from quoted option volatilities interest rate swaps are measured at the present value of future cash 
flows estimated and discounted based on the applicable yield curves derived from quoted interest rates. No derivatives are 
designated as hedges for the purposes of financial reporting. Warrants provided to the holder of the OCCRPS were valued 
through use of a binomial model by reference to forecast performance of the underlying assets.
The principal amount in respect of interest rate swaps held at 31 December 2010 was US$99.5 million carrying an interest rate

23. f inancial risk management objectives and policies
The Group’s principal financial liabilities, other than derivatives, comprise loans and overdrafts, debentures, finance leases and 
trade payables. The main purpose of these financial liabilities is to raise finance for the Group’s operations. The Group has various 
financial assets such as trade receivables, cash, and short term deposits, which arise directly from its operations.
The Group is subject to fluctuations in commodity prices and currency exchange rates due to nature of its operations. The Group 
enters into derivative transactions, primarily in the nature of commodity option and swap contracts and forward currency contracts. 
The purpose is to manage commodity price risk and currency risks arising from the Group’s operations.
The main risks arising from the Group’s financial instruments are interest rate risk, liquidity risk, foreign currency risk, commodity 
price risk and credit risk. The Board of Directors reviews and agrees policies for managing each of these risks which are 
summarised below.
Interest rate risk 
The Group’s exposure to the risk of changes in market interest rates relates primarily to the Group’s long term debt obligations 
with floating interest rates. The Group’s policy is to manage its interest cost using a mix of fixed and floating rate debts.
The following table provides a breakdown of the Group’s fixed and floating rate borrowings:
As at 31 December

$ million
2009 
$ million
Fixed rate borrowings 3,463.8  2,693.8 
Floating rate borrowings 1,033.8  415.2 
The following table demonstrates the sensitivity to a reasonably possible change in interest rates, being a 0.5% increase or 
decrease in interest rate, with all other variables held constant, of the Group’s profit before tax due to the impact on floating  
rate borrowings.

f oreign currency risk
The Group has significant investments and operations in India. Accordingly, its financial state of affairs can be affected significantly 
by movements in the Rs/US dollar exchange rates.
The Group also has transactional currency exposures. Such exposure arises from sales or purchases by an operating unit in 
currencies other than the unit’s functional currency. Foreign currency swaps, options and forward contracts are used to mitigate 
the risk arising from fluctuations in foreign exchange rates.
The carrying amounts of the Group’s financial assets and liabilities denominated in different currencies are as follows:

The Group’s exposure to foreign currency arises in part where a Group company holds financial assets and liabilities denominated 
in a currency different from the functional currency of that entity with US dollar being the major non-functional currency of the 
Group’s main operating subsidiaries. Set out below is the impact of a 10% movement in the US dollar on profit before tax arising 
as a result of the revaluation of the Group’s foreign currency financial assets and liabilities:

Effect of 10% strengthening of US$ against Rs on profit before tax (185.0)  (80.3)
The Group enters into forward foreign exchange contracts to cover foreign currency payments and receipts. The Group also 
enters into forward foreign exchange contracts to manage the risk associated with anticipated sales and purchase transactions.
The Group has taken forward cover of US$910.5 million (2009: US$1,377.3 million) to hedge against currency risk against 
movement in Rs/US dollar. 
The impact of a 10% weakening of the US dollar on profit before tax will be the same as disclosed above except that losses would 
be converted to gains.
Credit risk
The Group is exposed to credit risk in the event of non-payment by customers. The Group is also exposed to credit risk from trade 
receivables, dues from related parties, term deposits, liquid investments and other financial instruments. 
The Group trades with recognised and creditworthy third parties. Cash, liquid investments and term deposits are held and 
derivatives are dealt with in banks either international or domestic with high credit ratings reflecting the needs of the Group to 
operate in territories where international credit ratings are limited by the credit rating of the relevant territory. It is the Group’s policy 
that all customers who wish to trade on credit terms are subject to credit verification procedures. In addition, receivable balances 
are monitored on an on-going basis. For transactions that do not occur in the country of the relevant operating unit, the Group 
does not offer credit terms without the approval of the appropriate authority. The Group does not consider there to be any 
significant credit risks in respect related parties.
The Group is exposed to credit risk in the event of non-payment by customers. The Group establishes an allowance for doubtful 
accounts that represents its estimate of incurred losses in respect of trade and other receivables. Trade receivables disclosed 
above include amounts (see below for aged analysis) which are past due at the reporting date but against which the Group has 
not recognised an allowance for doubtful receivables because there has not been a significant change in credit quality and the 
amounts are still considered recoverable. No allowance for doubtful has been made in the accounts as at 31 December 2010 and 
2009. None of those trade debtors past due or impaired have had their terms renegotiated. The maximum exposure to credit risk 
at the reporting date is the fair value of each class of debtors presented in the financial statement. The Group does not hold any 
collateral or other credit enhancements over balances with third parties nor does it have a legal right of offset against any amounts 
owed by the Group to the counterparty.
The Group has assigned certain amounts in respect of its sales tax obligations to a related party which has been guaranteed by  
a counter party as described in Note 28. Essar Energy plc Annual report + accounts 2010

GUVNL. Payments on ordinary ongoing billings are received from GUVNL regularly and are off set against amounts due. Overdue 
amounts which are five years or greater are in relation to amounts due for construction activities performed which the Group have 
been successful in securing award of payment through arbitration proceedings. The awards have since been challenged by the 
counterparties. The amounts have not been provided for on the basis of the arbitration awards in favour of the Group.
Liquidity risk
Group companies monitor their risk of shortage of funds using cash flow forecasting models. These models consider the maturity 
of their financial investments, committed funding and projected cash flows from operations.
The Group’s objective is to provide financial resources to meet its business objectives in a timely, cost effective and reliable 
manner and to manage its capital structure in line with its two internal debt protection ratios. A balance between continuity of 
funding and flexibility is maintained through the use of bank loans, debentures, preference shares and finance leases. Out of the 
Group’s liabilities, 27.4% will mature in less than one year (2009: 42.5%). The maturity profile of the Group’s recognised financial 
liabilities on a gross basis is given in the table below:

Commodity price risk
The prices of refined petroleum products and crude oil are linked to the international prices. The Group’s revenues, costs and 
inventories are exposed to the risk of fluctuation in prices of crude oil and petroleum products in the international markets. From 
time to time, the Group uses commodity derivative instruments to hedge the price risk of forecasted transactions such as forecast 
crude oil purchases and refined product sales. These derivative instruments are considered economic hedges for which changes 
in their fair value are recorded in the consolidated income statement.
The Group operates a risk management desk that uses hedging instruments to seek to reduce the impact of market volatility  
in crude oil and product prices on the Group’s profitability. To this end, the Group’s risk management desk uses a range of 
conventional oil price-related financial and commodity derivative instruments such as futures, swaps and options that are available 
in the commodity derivative markets. The derivative instruments used for hedging purposes typically do not expose the Group  
to market risk because the change in their market value is usually offset by an equal and opposite change in the market value of 
the underlying asset, liability or transaction being hedged. The Group’s open positions in commodity derivative instruments are 
monitored and managed on a daily basis to ensure compliance with its stated risk management policy which has been approved 
by the management.
Set out below is the impact of 10% increase or decrease in base crude and petroleum product prices on profit before tax as a 
result of change in value of the Group’s commodity derivative instruments:

production.
Capital management
The Group’s objectives while managing capital are to safeguard its ability to continue as a going concern and to provide adequate 
returns for its shareholders and benefits for other stakeholders. The Group’s policy is generally to optimise borrowings at an 
operating company level within an acceptable level of debt. Equity funding for existing operations or new acquisitions is raised 
centrally, first from excess cash and then from new borrowings while retaining on an acceptable level of debt for the consolidated 
Group. The Group’s policy is to borrow using a mixture of long term and short term debts from both local and international 
financial markets together with operating cash generated to meet anticipated funding requirements. 
The Group monitors capital using a gearing ratio, which is net debt divided by total capital plus net debt. The Group includes 
within net debt, interest bearing loans and borrowings less cash and cash equivalents, short term and long term deposits.  
Total Equity includes equity attributable to the equity holders of the Group as well as non-controlling interest.

The fair value of the financial assets and liabilities are estimated at the amount at which the instrument could be exchanged in a 
current transaction between willing parties, other than in a forced or liquidation sale. Other than fair value of derivatives set out in 
Note 20, the following methods and assumptions were used to estimate the fair values:
cash and short term deposits, trade and other receivables, trade and other payables, and other current liabilities approximate ¸ ¸
their carrying amounts largely due to the short term maturities or nature of these instruments.
the fair value of listed investments is determined by reference to market price at the close of business on the balance sheet date. ¸ ¸
The fair value of unlisted investments held by the Group is estimated with reference to the net assets of the underlying 
businesses at each reporting date. 
the fair value of loans from banks and other financial indebtedness as well as other non-current financial liabilities is estimated by ¸ ¸
discounting future cash flows using rates currently available for debt or similar terms and remaining maturities. The discounting 
rate ranges from 11.25% to 12.00%.
The Group financial assets and liabilities that are measured subsequent to initial recognition at fair value are derivatives (Note 20) 
and AFS investments (Note 13). Derivative financial assets and liabilities are classified as Level 2 fair value measurements, as 
defined by IFRS 7, being those derived from inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the assets or liability, either 
directly (i.e. price) or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices). AFS investments are classified as Level 3 fair value measurements, as 
assets held are unquoted. There were no transfers between categories throughout the periods presented. The carrying value  
of all other financial assets and liabilities closely approximate their fair value except for borrowings (Note 18) where fair values  
are estimated to be US$4,295.7 million (2009: US$3,004.1 million).

25a. Acquisition of n avbharat power private Limited
On 12 July 2010, Essar Energy, through its subsidiary EPOL, entered in to a binding agreement for the acquisition of a 100% 
interest in Navabharat Power Private Limited (‘NPPL ’) for a consideration of US$50.2 million. EPOL initially acquired a 76% interest 
for a cash consideration of US$31.2 million with the balance to be acquired upon completion of certain project milestones. After 
acquisition, the Group also infused further project equity of US$21.6 million. The transaction was treated as a 100% acquisition  
on 12 July 2010, as the most significant condition for its completion in respect of obtaining project financing was satisfied with 
remaining project milestones being procedural in nature. 
NPPL is a 2,250 MW coal-fuelled power plant under construction in Orissa, India. The project is estimated to cost a total of 
US$2.0 billion and is being implemented in two phases. The first and second phase are expected to provide capacities of 
1,050 MW and 1,200 MW, respectively. Prior to the acquisition, NPPL had already obtained certain key regulatory approvals for 
the construction project including those in respect of environmental and forest clearance from the Ministry of Environment and 
Forests. By virtue of the acquisition, Group has obtained a 17.39% interest in the allocation of the Rampia coal block of  
112 million tonnes and a 4.7 mmt per annum coal linkage with Coal India Limited. 
The Group has accounted for the acquisition of NPPL as a business combination using the purchase method. The fair value of the

25b. Acquisition of pt b ara pratama Indonesia (‘pt bp I’) 
On April 13, 2010, Essar Energy through its subsidiary Essar Minerals FZE acquired a 99.96% voting interest in PT BPI.  
PT BPI holds a 99.99% stake in PT Manoor Bulatn Lestri which own the exploitation license for a coal mine in West Kutai  
(East Kalimantan) Indonesia (the ‘Aries coal mine’). 
The mine has an area of 5,000 Ha and JORC compliant reserves of approx. 64 mmt with appropriate environmental approvals  
in place. The process for obtaining the necessary forest approvals is currently in progress. 
The Group has accounted for the above transaction as an asset acquisition. The consideration paid in cash for the acquisition  
of PTBPI and PT MBL was US$118.0 million which has been recorded as an addition in the period within property, plant  
and equipment. 
25c. Acquisition of essar Recursos Minerals Mozambique Limitada (‘eRMML’)
Essar Energy acquired ERMML from Essar Minerals Limited, its fellow subsidiary within the EGL group, in April 2010 for a cash 
consideration of US$29.9 million. The transaction was deemed to be at arm’s length.
ERMML holds a coal licence in the Cambulatsitsi, Mozambique and the mine is estimated to have coal resources of approximately 
35 mmt. Essar Energy has accounted for the above transaction as an asset acquisition with the total consideration being included 
as an addition in the period within property, plant and equipment.  Essar Energy plc Annual report + accounts 2010

27a. Contingencies
Contingent liabilities
Contingent liabilities at the balance sheet date, not otherwise provided for in the consolidated financial statements are categorised 
as follows:

Others 13.7  48.6 
t otal 367.6 273.1
1 The Group has assumed that certain facilities will be paid at the earliest redemption date, subject to lenders confirmation and thus interest charge has been based on applicable early 
redemption rates. This amount represents the cumulative additional interest that would have been charged to the income statement in the period if the related debt would not be prepaid  
at the earliest redemption date. Any additional interest payable in the future is secured by a first charge on the current assets and a second charge on property, plant and equipment.
Contingent liabilities relate predominantly to actual or potential litigation of the Group for which amounts are reasonably  
assessable but the liability is not probable and therefore the Group has not provided for such amounts in this consolidated 
financial statements. The amounts relate to a number of actions against the Group, none of which are individually significant. 
Additionally, there are a number of legal claims or potential claims against the Group, the outcome of which cannot be foreseen  
at present, and for which no amounts have been included in the table above.
Sales tax benefit
In relation to benefits under the Sales Tax Incentive Scheme, there is an ongoing dispute surrounding the eligibility of EOL to 
qualify for the Sales Tax Incentive Scheme. An order was issued by the Honourable High Court of Gujarat on 22 April 2008, which 
confirmed, amongst other things, that EOL is eligible for the Sales Tax Incentive Scheme. Subsequently the State Government  
of Gujarat filed a Special Leave Petition in the Honourable Supreme Court, challenging the order of the Honourable High Court.  
The case has not yet been heard by the Honourable Supreme Court but the Group believes it has a high likelihood of success. 
In order to qualify for the Sales Tax Incentive Scheme, various conditions must be met including ensuring certain percentages  
of employees are local, re-investing certain amounts of the benefit, adhering to specified pollution control measures and also 
contributing a certain amount to prescribed rural development scheme in the State of Gujarat by the Group over a period 
estimated to be up to 17 years to ensure that the full benefit of the sales tax deferral which has been recorded can be retained  
by the Group. 
In the event that such conditions are not met, the payment of sales tax including interest to the State of Gujarat will be accelerated, 
and there will be an accounting charge to reflect the fact that the liability is discounted. As a consequence, there may be an 
additional potential liability resulting from a breach of financial covenants as stipulated under the MRA of EOL. Management 
believes there is a high likelihood that these conditions will be met. 
As of 31 December 2010, the Group has collected and retained an amount of US$950.6 million (2009: US$553.5 million)  
with the cumulative effect of discounting (net of the effect of unwinding) being US$698.2 million (2009: US$413.4 million). 
Claim by customer 
On 14 September 2005, GUVNL, an entity controlled by the State of Gujarat, filed a petition against EPOL with the Gujarat 
Electricity Regulatory Commission (the ‘GERC’) alleging that EPOL diverted electricity generated by its Hazira power plant to Essar 
Steel, a related party, in violation of its power purchase agreement (‘PPA’) with the Gujarat Electricity Board, whose assets and 
liabilities were transferred to GUVNL in 2003 and incorrectly claimed certain fuel generation credits from GUVNL between 1996 
and 2006. GUVNL claimed a total of approximately US$353.3 million (2009: US$339.1 million) from the Group.
On 18 February 2009, the GERC ruled in favour of GUVNL for the diversion of electricity by EPOL. The GERC also awarded 
GUVNL a refund for generation incentives incorrectly claimed from 14 September 2002 to 29 May 2006. The GERC, however, 
ruled that recovery of the incorrectly claimed generation incentives and of compensation for the electricity supplied to Essar Steel 
Limited in breach of the PPA prior to September 2002 was barred by the applicable statute of limitation.
Both EPOL and GUVNL appealed the GERC’s ruling to the Appellate Tribunal for Electricity, New Delhi. The Appellate Tribunal held 
on 22 February 2010 that EPOL was not liable to pay compensation for alleged wrongful diversion of power to Essar Steel or for 
the reimbursement of the annual fixed charges. The Appellate Tribunal further held that EPOL was liable to refund to GUVNL the 
deemed generation incentive paid on and after 14 September 2002 which the Group had already provided for.
On 29 January 2010, EPOL filed a petition before the GERC against GUVNL claiming certain payments due to it under the PPA. 
EPOL has made a claim for an aggregate amount of US$87.8 million (2009: US$84.4 million) comprising delayed payment 
charges, depreciation, foreign exchange variation, interest on debentures, bill discounting charges, interest on working capital  
and alleged wrongful deduction of rebate by GUVNL. The matter is pending before the GERC. Essar Energy plc Annual report + accounts 2010

27. Contingencies, commitments and guarantees continued
In respect of the outstanding claims, the Group does not expect to incur costs or loss in excess of amounts provided in defending 
its position and recovering its dues.
In April 2010, GUVNL filed two separate appeals before the Supreme Court against the common judgement of the Appellate 
Tribunal for stay of the implementation of the order of the Appellate Tribunal. The Group has filed caveats against the stay to 
oppose admission of the appeals as well as the grants of stay. The case was heard in May 2010 and after hearing the arguments 
from both parties, the court directed to file written submissions. The written submissions have been filed by both parties. Hearing 
on the admission of the appeal is expected shortly.
Other claims 
There are a number of other claims in connection with the Group. However management believes that the probability of future 
liabilities in respect of such claims is remote and no amounts have been provided or disclosed as contingent liabilities over the 
periods presented.
Contingent assets
In June 1998, a cyclone hit the west coast of India which caused extensive damages to the refinery site leading to delays in the 
construction and completion of the refinery. The insurance company and the Company have since decided to settle the claim by 
arbitration. The Company had filed an initial claim of US$674.0 million (2009: US$647.0 million) before the arbitration panel covering 
loss of profit, material damage and interest. During the arbitration proceedings, the Company had revised its claim. The arbitration 
proceedings are currently at an advanced stage. Pending the outcome of arbitration, the claim amount is not recognised in the 
financial statements. 
27b. Commitments

27. Contingencies, commitments and guarantees continued
Any potential losses incurred in the future by the Group of up to US$197.0 million in respect of these guarantees are indemnified 
by EGL. 
The majority of guarantees provided have been treated as insurance contracts in line with the Group’s accounting policies.
28. Related parties
The Group, as discussed in Note 1, is part of the wider group of companies controlled by EGL and its controlling shareholders and 
as a result has entered into a number of transactions with other wider Essar group entities (the ‘Essar Group’). The Group shares 
many functions and services that are performed by various members of the Essar Group for which costs are allocated across the 
relevant benefiting entities which have benefited. The costs have been historically allocated on a basis which the Essar Group 
believes is a reasonable reflection of the utilisation of each service provided or the benefit received by each Essar Group company. 
The allocated costs, while reasonable, may not necessarily be indicative of the costs that would have been incurred by the 
Company if it had performed these functions or received these services as a stand-alone entity. 
The Company and EGL entered into a Relationship Agreement, the principal purpose of which was to ensure that following listing, 
the Group was capable of carrying on its business independently of EGL and its associates.
Balances and transactions between entities within the Group, which are related parties, have been eliminated and are not 
disclosed in this note.

Essar Power Holding Limited (‘EPH’) entered into a share purchase agreement, governed by Indian law, dated 6 April 2010 with 
Essar Steel Limited, a related party, pursuant to which Essar Steel Limited has agreed to transfer its shareholding of 217,000,000 
equity shares, representing 26% of the issued equity share capital of Essar Power Limited to EPH for a consideration of 
Rs. 4.4 billion (US$98.2 million). Apart from customary conditions precedent, such as the receipt of all regulatory approvals  
in relation to the transfer, the transfer is subject to the commencement of commercial operations in Unit I of the Essar Power 
Gujarat—Salaya project, the Essar Power MP-Mahan project and Phase I and Phase II of the existing power plant of VPCL.  
This condition precedent may be waived by EPH at any time. The sale is also subject to EPH providing Essar Steel Limited an 
indemnity towards reimbursement of any cross subsidy surcharge payable by Essar Steel Limited under applicable law as a result 
of the transfer of its shareholding in Essar Power Limited. However, this requirement may be waived by Essar Steel Limited at its 
discretion. The transfer of Essar Steel Limited’s shareholding in Essar Power Limited to EPH is subject to applicable law and may 
not be given effect to in the event the conditions precedent are not satisfied or waived prior to 30 September 2011. Pending 
completion of such sale, Essar Steel has agreed that the exercise of its voting rights in respect of its shares in Essar Power shall 
be subject to the prior approval of EPH in relation to a number of matters including the following matters: (a) capital expenditures 
or acquisitions of assets, unless already in the annual business plan; (b) all related party transactions including the terms and 
conditions for such transactions; and (c) declaration or payment of any dividend.

Energy Holding (‘EEH’), a subsidiary of the Company, has an option to acquire the shares held by Essar Investments in EOL in  
the period between 1 May 2010 and 31 December 2011 at the higher of: (a) Rs. 153 and (b) the minimum price required to be  
paid under applicable law, which is currently the closing price of the shares of EOL on the relevant stock exchange on the date 
preceding the date of the transfer of the shares. In the event of the option lapsing, holding cost payable is measured as 10% of  
the higher of (a) the average weekly high and low of the closing prices of the share of EOL during the 26 weeks period prior to 
1 January 2012; and (b) the average of the daily high and low of the prices of the shares EOL during the two week period prior  
to 1 January 2012.
The shares held by Essar Investments Limited are presently pledged in favour of various Indian banks and the actual transfer of  
the shares pursuant to the exercise of the call option by EEH will be subject to the release of these pledges by the relevant banks. 
In light of the shares being pledged, the addendum agreement extended the vesting period of the option by a further 12 months. 
Essar Investment Limited has also waived the holding costs payable as the shares cannot be delivered and are encumbered.

Definition and comparability of CP GRM 
GRM is calculated as actual sales net of crude costs derived from the accounts. Inventory gains and losses, hedging gains and 
losses and sales tax benefit for the period also form part of the GRM. Based on this method of calculation, Essar Energy’s 
reported GRMs are not directly comparable to the performance of other refiners, other refining benchmarks and industry reports 
due to following reasons: 
The Vadinar refinery operates in the State of Gujarat and benefits from a Government sales tax incentive, although the validity  ¸ ¸
of this benefit is being contested by the State of Gujarat in Supreme Court of India. 
In India, domestic products are sold based on Government decided formulae known as Refinery Transfer Price, (‘RTP’). RTP of ¸ ¸
LPG and Kerosene are based on the average market price of the previous month, while for other products including gasoil and 
gasoline it is based on the average price of the previous fortnight. As a result the revenues may not match the prevailing product 
prices for the period. 
The Company adopts the first in, first out (FIFO) methodology for crude inventory valuation. As a consequence the cost of crude ¸ ¸
consumed can be crude purchased in earlier periods which may not reflect current prevailing crude prices. For crudes with a 
long voyage time these differences can be more significant. 
Sales quantity does not directly match actual production during the period as there may be inventory movement compared to  ¸ ¸
a previous period. 
Commodity derivative instruments are used to act as an economic hedge against the price risk of forecast crude oil purchases, ¸ ¸
future refined product sales and future product crack margins. These derivative instruments are required to be recorded at fair 
value with gains and losses recognised in income because hedge accounting is not applied. 
The following adjustments are made to the accounting GRM to provide a CP GRM that reflects underlying operational 
performance and better communicates industry comparable performance of the refinery. These adjustments are as follows: 
The sales quantity is taken as actual production during the period. This eliminates the effect of inventory gains and losses in the ¸ ¸
GRM. This sales quantity is allocated into export and domestic sales based on the actual ratio of export and domestic sales for 
the period. 
The cost of crude is taken at the current prices of crude grades actually consumed, net of premium or discounts as applicable. ¸ ¸
Prevailing custom duty is applied on the cost of crude. 
To calculate the revenue from the sales quantity the domestic sales price is valued based on the RTP of the same period rather ¸ ¸
than any other period. Export prices are based on actual realised export prices, as they do not have timing differences. Revenue 
is adjusted for premiums or discounts achieved by the Company. For domestic sales custom duty recovery is built up in RTP 
itself whilst duty benefit for exports is added separately. 
The impact of economic hedging gains or losses is excluded. ¸ ¸
The impact of the Gujarat Government sales tax benefit is separately identified. ¸ ¸

Accounts contain forward-looking information concerning 
the Group’s strategy, operations, financial performance or 
condition, outlook, growth opportunities or circumstances 
in the countries, sectors or markets in which the Group

can be given that such expectations will prove to have been 
correct. Actual results could differ materially from those 
set out in the forward-looking statements. For a detailed 
analysis of the factors that may affect our business, financial 
performance or results of operations, we urge you to look 
at the Principal Risks and Uncertainties included in this 
Annual Report and Accounts. No part of these results 
constitutes, or shall be taken to constitute, an invitation

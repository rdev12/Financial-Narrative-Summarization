CHAIRMAN’S QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS
Q. While the financial performance for 2004 was good, 
do you feel that enough was done to strengthen the
fundamentals of the business?
A. Yes. Our earnings were strong but this was not purely a
function of commodity prices. They reflect, for example, 
the value adding nature of the acquisitions made over the
last four years – especially Minera Sur Andes, Syktyvkar,
Cerrejón – and the De Beers transaction. These have produced
a stronger and more balanced portfolio. Who, in the past,
would have predicted the pre-eminence of Latin America 
in our 2004 earnings? Nor, in a year of ‘plenty’, have we
rested on our laurels. We have realised a further $554 million
in cost savings. Through the merger with Ashanti Goldfields,
AngloGold’s resource base and growth prospects have been
strengthened. Reorganisations within Anglo Platinum and
Paper and Packaging have been carried out. We launched a
drive to encourage innovation and greater entrepreneurialism.
The fundamentals of the business are stronger than they
were 12 months ago. 
Q. Many of the opportunities which Anglo is examining are
in ‘new geographies’. Do you think you are properly
equipped to manage the risks involved?
A. Actually, we have a strong project pipeline in very familiar
regions – southern Africa, South America, eastern Europe
and Australia. We are also looking at new geographies,
chiefly China, Russia and India, since each has the potential
to be a major growth market as well as a significant
commodities producer. Our approach has been to become
involved, initially in a relatively limited way, while we seek
to better understand the risks of doing business in each. 
The board is very supportive of this and believes it is one 
of Anglo’s strengths. When I went to China, for example, 
I visited small Anglo businesses in quarrying and drilling
equipment and was briefed on three other potential
opportunities. Similarly, we held a stake in Syktyvkar in
Russia for five years before taking control. This gradualist
approach gives us a better feel for the operating
environment in new countries. 
Q. There was a controversy about Anglo’s judgement of
political risk in South Africa – where do things now
stand on this?
A. The problem was never our perception of political risk – but
those of some people in the international capital markets.
These concerns are largely the legacy of the leaking of an
early draft of the Mining Empowerment Charter in 2002.
Confidence has been returning as this memory has receded
and this will be given momentum by the successful
conversion of ‘old order’ mineral rights. We remain committed
to South Africa and are strongly supportive of the agreed
scorecard approach in the Mining Act and the need to deliver
on it – hence our big continuing investment programme. 
To an extent I can share the frustration of the South African
government. It has pursued exemplary macro-economic
policies and deserves to have been rewarded with more
foreign direct investment. 
Q. Anglo is used to thinking about physical assets, finance
and technology. Are you as good at nurturing talent?
A. I would like to thank our employees for their commitment in
2004. During my site visits and at the centre I have been
impressed by the calibre of Anglo’s people. I like the fact
that we typically entrust most senior operational posts to
locally recruited managers. We have become much more
strategic and proactive in creating a performance-driven
culture, career and talent management, addressing
shortcomings in our engagement with employees and in
moving to a more diverse workforce. We have been better 
at the traditional ‘hard’ skills, but the board has identified
‘people’ issues as a strategic priority and we are now
definitely moving in the right direction. 
Q. What do you see as the non-financial highlights of 2004?
A. I would highlight four. First, Anglo became a signatory to the
UN Global Compact – the ten principles of which we fully
support – and made all the preparations to become a party 
to the Voluntary Principles on Security and Human Rights.
Secondly, our work on HIV/AIDS continued to progress, 
with some 2,200 employees now on anti-retrovirals and 
an improved uptake of voluntary counselling and testing.
Thirdly, our innovative Socio-Economic Assessment Toolbox
process had an enthusiastic take-up at site level, with some
30 assessments already under way. Fourthly, we reorganised
how we bring the strands of sustainable development
together and instituted a project to improve our calibration 
of sustainable development risk. The benefits of these
changes will come through during 2005. 
Q. Y ou are closely identified with ‘sustainable development’
and ‘corporate responsibility’ – how would you answer
those who say it is a peripheral issue or, as in the
recent Economist article, that business should just
concentrate on profits for shareholders?
A. Sustainable development is absolutely central to the future
acceptability of our business and to its ongoing success and
profitability. Our businesses have high environmental and
social impacts, many deplete a non-renewable (albeit generally
recyclable) resource, and global concerns like climate change
and HIV/AIDS are highly relevant to us. These issues 
reflect upon our licence to operate, our sustainability as an
investment, our ability to attract the most talented recruits
and our acceptability to governments and communities.
Moreover, our ability to understand and address societal
concerns is fundamental to our good name and the value 
of that reputation. 
Q. Are you concerned that other stakeholders, like
governments and more assertive communities, 
want to increase their share of the profits from 
your operations?
A. Every enterprise faces tensions around how rewards are
shared – investors, employees, suppliers and customers all
want their ‘fair share’. In the natural resources business
there are more parties to the process. For much of the last
30 years mining has been a value destroyer for investors.
Governments tend to overlook the lean times when
proposing new or higher taxes in years like this. During
2005, Chile and South Africa are both planning to decide
upon a royalty regime. Such taxes have implications for
competitiveness, investment and employment. Some
communities feel they get a raw deal when fiscal benefits
are often only felt at a national level. We seek to improve
the local development effects of our businesses but it is
important too for national governments to ensure that a
proportion of tax revenues is shared with local people. 
Q. Were there any major disappointments in 2004 – 
if so, how do you intend to rectify them?
A. The increase in fatalities at our managed operations from 
44 to 49 was of course a major disappointment. There was 
a welcome further improvement in the lost time injury
frequency rate of 23%, but we are not prepared to be
philosophical about the death of any employee or contractor.
There is already an emphasis on improving safety at all sites,
but it is evidently not enough. Thus, we must continue to
emphasise visible felt leadership in the field of safety, focus
on safety for contractors – who made up over half the 2004
7878v03_PH_Rp_FC-p27_020305.qxp  4/3/05  2:04 am  Page 02 Anglo American plc Annual Report 2004 03
CHIEF EXECUTIVE’S
STATEMENT
fatalities – and seek to focus on leading indicators such as
‘near hits’ and tackling unsafe behaviour. We have made
good progress over the last four years and we will do our
utmost to return to the path of improvement. 
Q. What changes are planned in the composition 
of the board? 
A. Bill Nairn, our technical director, retired from the board at 
the end of 2004. I am grateful for the experience that he
brought to the Group and especially his relentless focus 
on safety. At the AGM, two non-executive directors will 
be retiring: Sir David Scholey and Göran Lindahl. Sir David
steps down after a long association with the Anglo Group,
including serving as a director since December 1999. Göran
has brought his wide international experience and knowledge
of sustainable development to our deliberations. We shall
miss them.
One new independent non-executive director, Ralph
Alexander, will be proposed at the AGM. He is an American
citizen and is chief executive of BP Petrochemicals. He brings
extensive experience of the energy business and has a
strong international background. Two new executive directors
will also be proposed: David Hathorn and Simon Thompson,
respectively chief executives of the Paper and Packaging and
Base Metals businesses. Both have played a major part in
the international expansion of the Group. In addition, it is
proposed that René Médori be elected a director with effect
from 1 June 2005. René, a French national, who has
extensive experience of UK and US business cultures, 
will be joining us from The BOC Group plc, where he is
finance director. He will succeed Tony Lea as finance director
in September and Tony will leave the board in December.
In relation to the Combined Code requirement to ‘comply 
or explain’ I should mention that we will briefly be 
non-compliant in that from June to December less than 
half the board, excluding myself, will be independent 
non-executive directors. I believe that this is fully justified 
in ensuring continuity and a smooth handover between 
Tony and René. 
Sir Mark Moody-Stuart 
Chairman
One of the dominant features of 2004 was the increased
demand for a range of commodities as China’s industrialising
economy continued to consume more raw materials. Copper,
nickel, zinc, coal and iron ore markets all benefited materially
and a number of these commodities reached their highest price
levels for many years. As a result of these strong conditions as
well as rising platinum, gold and diamond prices, Anglo American
reported record headline earnings of $2.69 billion and headline
earnings per share increased by 57% to $1.88 per share. 
Nonetheless, the year was dominated by two major influences –
volatile global markets, largely because of the uncertain outlook
in the Middle East; and the possibility of a marked slowdown in
China’s economic growth rate. During the second, and again in
the fourth quarter of the year, markets grew concerned that
official Chinese attempts to slow down excessive investment
and growth would result in a ‘hard landing’. During each of these
periods, metals prices responded by dropping sharply and then
rebounding fairly quickly. Chinese GDP growth is now projected
to average around 8% for 2005. 
In line with the board’s policy of progressively increasing
dividends, the board has decided to increase the final dividend
by 12 cents to 51 cents per share, resulting in a total dividend
of 70 cents per share for 2004, up 30%.
STRATEGY
Since our primary London listing in mid-1999, Anglo American
has grown by over 70%, with a present market capitalisation
now approaching $38 billion. Our strong cash generation
has been matched by one of the largest capital expenditure
programmes in the industry. Our existing $4.7 billion project
pipeline and more than $8 billion in unapproved projects, spread
across all our business units and geographies, provide an
excellent platform for growth going forward. We will continue 
to enhance and add value to Anglo’s portfolio of world-class
assets in all areas; in particular, through:
Securing the most competitive cost of capital
Owning world-class assets
Anglo’s high-calibre employees 
Innovation and entrepreneurship
Development of world-class technology
Maintaining high standards of sustainable development
Becoming the business partner of choice to suppliers, 
customers and key stakeholders.
Our strategy for future investment remains focused around the
three key areas that make up our portfolio, namely Precious
Commodities, Metals and Minerals, and Paper and Packaging.
ACQUISITIONS AND ORGANIC GROWTH
Although Anglo American remains cautious about valuations at
this point in the cycle, the Group continues to examine expansion
and acquisition opportunities in all its business sectors.
The following overview of our business units covers key
developments; detailed summaries of operating performances
are contained on pages 7 to 14 of this report.
Platinum
We are actively focusing on achieving further business optimisation 
in Anglo Platinum. The strong level of the South African rand
continues to materially affect the rate of expansion and also
operating costs when translated into US dollars. The projects that
have been earmarked for development will continue to be reviewed
in light of the strong rand.

CHIEF EXECUTIVE’S STATEMENT
CONTINUED
Despite the loss of production due to industrial action during
October, arising out of wage negotiations, Anglo Platinum
achieved its 2004 target of producing 2.45 million ounces 
of refined platinum. The company recently established a 
co-operative joint venture contract with Sichuan Mineral Resource
Company to conduct exploration for platinum group metals in
China's Sichuan Province.
Gold
One of the most significant transactions of the year was the
merger of AngloGold and Ashanti Goldfields, which was completed
in April. The merger has resulted in a substantial increase in gold
reserves against a background of a diminishing global reserve
base. AngloGold Ashanti continues to pursue further growth
opportunities in new frontiers such as Laos, the Philippines 
and Russia, in partnership with junior mining and exploration
companies. AngloGold Ashanti, in which Anglo American holds 
a 51% stake, is the world’s second largest gold mining company
in terms of production. 
Diamonds
De Beers’ strategy of Supplier of Choice, which focuses 
on driving demand in the diamond industry, continues to be
implemented successfully. Central to this has been the realignment
of De Beers’ relationship with its sightholders, a process that 
is now substantially complete and that has brought about
considerable benefits for De Beers and the diamond industry 
as a whole. De Beers’ $180 million a year advertising and
marketing spend has been significantly bolstered by an increase
in advertising programmes by sightholders and their downstream
trade partners. Following years of underperformance in terms of
market share, diamonds are now competing successfully with
other luxury goods. At the retail level, sales of diamonds worldwide
exceeded $60 billion for the first time.
An important breakthrough took place in July when De Beers
announced that it had reached a settlement with the US
Department of Justice for the resolution of a longstanding case
against De Beers in respect of industrial diamonds. The resolution
of the case underscores the company’s commitment to be fully
legally compliant throughout the world.
In December, De Beers announced that it had secured a 25 year
renewal of all four mining leases in Botswana, on a coterminous
basis. De Beers and the European Commission are in the final
stages of a constructive dialogue to address the Commission’s
concerns over aspects of the five year trade agreement between
De Beers and Russian diamond producer Alrosa. 
Base Metals
On the back of high base metals prices and record production 
of copper, nickel, zinc and mineral sands products, Base Metals
achieved record headline earnings of just over $1 billion. 
The acquisition of Minera Sur Andes was a major contributor
to this performance with headline earnings of $430 million. 
A significant achievement during the year was the Skorpion zinc
mine in Namibia commencing commercial production in May and
achieving 95% of design capacity by year end. Commissioning
of the $654 million Collahuasi Rosario Project in Chile commenced
in April, some five weeks ahead of schedule and under budget.
The project rapidly achieved design capacity and will enable
Collahuasi to maintain production of copper in concentrate at 
a long term average rate of 400,000 tonnes per annum. 
Codemin, in Brazil, became a wholly-owned subsidiary following
the purchase of the remaining 10% from the International Finance
Corporation, and the expansion project was completed on time
and on budget and will ramp up to full capacity during the first
quarter of 2005. In line with Base Metals’ strategy of focusing
on fewer, larger, lower cost assets, its 25% stake in Nkomati
Nickel was disposed of in February for $37 million and Hudson
Bay in Canada was sold for $257 million.
Coal
In December, Anglo American and Mitsui announced the
approval of the $653 million Dawson Complex, which will
include the recapitalisation of the existing operation at Moura 
in central Queensland, Australia and the establishment of two
additional operations on adjacent tenures. This will increase
production by 5.7 million tonnes per annum over Moura’s
existing saleable production of 7 million tonnes per annum. 
In October, Anglo American and Kumba signed Heads of
Agreement that could lead to the development of a major 
coking coal mine in central Queensland.
In August, Anglo Coal and Eyesizwe announced that they 
were entering into a 50:50 joint venture to mine the Arnot 
North coal reserves, known as Mafube Colliery, and mining has
commenced. A new opencast operation, the Isibonelo Colliery, is
being developed to provide Sasol with 5 million tonnes of coal per
annum. Production is due to commence in mid-2005. Anglo Coal
and BHP Billiton are jointly investigating the proposed expansion
of coal resources in the Western Complex in South Africa.
In Colombia the approved expansion at Cerrejón from 22 million
to 28 million tonnes per annum is on schedule and should be
achieved by 2007. 
Paper and Packaging
In April, Anglo American’s wholly-owned subsidiary Mondi
acquired the remaining 30% interest in Frantschach for a total
consideration of $390 million. The acquisitions of Copamex’s
industrial packaging businesses (renamed Mondimex) and Roman
Bauernfeind were completed in the first quarter of 2004 and are
performing according to expectations, having strengthened
Mondi’s position in the North American and central European
markets respectively.
In November, Mondi announced a major restructuring focused 
on global product lines, namely Mondi Business Paper and Mondi
Packaging. The reorganisation has streamlined and rebranded the
existing businesses under the Mondi name, allowing the group to
improve its visibility to customers and to reduce its overhead costs.
Industrial Minerals
In the UK, Anglo Industrial Minerals’ new cement plant at Buxton
commenced operating in March and is ramping up to full capacity
of 800,000 tonnes per annum. The project cost of £110 million
was £5 million below budget. In China, the Yang Quarry,
situated 140 kilometres from Shanghai and the closest reserve
of top-quality asphalt aggregates to China’s commercial capital,
commenced production at the end of the year. Production will 
be ramped up during 2005. Following completion of the Goiás
project in 2003, Copebrás almost doubled its contribution on the
back of buoyant Brazilian fertiliser markets. 
Ferrous Metals and Industries
With global steel production surpassing 1 billion tonnes for the
first time, the contribution from Ferrous Metals and Industries’
operations increased more than fourfold. Regarding Kumba's
Hope Downs iron ore project in Australia, which has been the
subject of a dispute with a local partner, Kumba is appealing a
recent arbitration decision. Subject to Kumba’s rights of appeal,
the process for determining a fair value, at which the local
partner can elect to acquire Kumba’s project interest, has
commenced. Until Kumba’s participation in the project is finally
resolved, it continues to perform its contractual obligations in
respect of the project.

SAFETY AND SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT
It is with deep regret that we report the deaths of 28 contractors
and 21 employees in accidents at our operations during the year.
This represented an increase of five deaths compared with 2003,
following four years of consistent decline. Such accidents are
wholly unacceptable and we will be redoubling our efforts to
eliminate them. It was encouraging, however, that the lost time
injury frequency rate improved by 23% – which indicates
success in embedding safer behaviour at site level.
We have made significant progress in addressing the sustainable
development agenda, including launching our Socio-Economic
Assessment Toolbox; making strides in improving local business
development and initiating a pilot sustainable development risk
management process.
SOUTH AFRICA: BLACK ECONOMIC EMPOWERMENT
During the year, several developments took place concerning the
legislative framework governing the transformation process in
South Africa’s mining industry. Most notably, the Mineral and
Petroleum Resources Development Act, which aims to make
transformation effective across a broad front – including human
resources and community development, as well as employment
equity – came into effect on 1 May 2004. All South African
mining operations are focused on the implementation of this Act.
Anglo American has submitted a number of applications to convert
‘old order’ mineral rights into ‘new order’ rights. The Group hopes
to be able to report progress in this regard later in the year. 
During the year the South African government confirmed 
that royalties in terms of the Royalty Bill will become payable
only in 2009; a second draft of the Royalty Bill is expected 
to be unveiled in the future.
We have adopted a comprehensive approach to transformation 
in South Africa, including the establishment of a Transformation
Committee, which has been integrated with all the business units’
activities. Procurement remains an important area of focus: over
the last year we spent the equivalent of $900 million on business
development and the procurement of goods and services from
black-owned businesses, up 62% on the previous year. 
Mondi South Africa concluded two significant empowerment
transactions during 2004. First in June, a joint venture was
formed with Shanduka Resources (formerly MCI Resources) 
in its integrated newsprint business, with Mondi retaining 
a 58% interest and, secondly, Mondi disposed of 42% of its 
$370 million South African packaging businesses to Shanduka,
effective 1 January 2005. These empowerment transactions
allowed for further interests in the newsprint and packaging
businesses to be set aside for broad based participation by 
Mondi South Africa employees and relevant communities.
DISPOSALS
During 2004, a number of disposals were made. These 
included Anglo American’s 20% stake in Gold Fields Limited 
for $1.18 billion, the remaining interest in FirstRand Limited for
$47 million and the Group’s 49% stake in Terra Industries Inc for
$255 million. In line with Base Metals’ strategy of focusing on
fewer, larger, lower cost assets, its 25% stake in Nkomati Nickel
was disposed of in February for $37 million and Hudson Bay in
Canada was sold for $257 million in December. Anglo American
and BHP Billiton have recently announced the sale of their
respective 40% and 60% shareholdings in Samancor Chrome
for an enterprise value of $469 million, the sale will be effective 
1 April 2005, subject to obtaining regulatory approvals.
OUTLOOK
The outlook for the year ahead is very dependent upon growth
prospects for Organisation for Economic Co-operation and
Development (OECD) countries and China. While the leading
indicators for the OECD currently point to some slowing of
industrial output growth during the first half, China continues 
to grow strongly and will remain a vital market for many of our
commodities. On the supply side, global output is generally set
to increase and much will depend on the industry maintaining
capital discipline in the face of higher commodity prices. A key
challenge for the Group will be to continue improving operating
efficiencies and cost control against a background of volatile
currencies and, in particular, a weak US dollar. In the meantime,
Anglo American’s geographic and commodity diversity, its
significant project pipeline, its disciplined acquisition process and
strong cash generation will continue to underpin performance. 
OUR EMPLOYEES
At the end of 2004, Bill Nairn retired as technical director. 
I would like to thank Bill for his long and dedicated service 
to the Group. He has been succeeded as technical director by
Tony Redman, who is also chairman of Anglo Coal, and who 
has been appointed to the Executive Board. In February 2005,
we announced the appointment of Lazarus Zim as chief
executive officer and Godfrey Gomwe as chief operating officer
of Anglo American Corporation of South Africa. Lazarus will 
also chair the South Africa Transformation Committee and has
joined the Executive Board. Finally, my appreciation and thanks
go to all our employees worldwide who, through their hard 
work and dedication, have helped make this a record year for
Anglo American.

FINANCIAL REVIEW
RESULTS SUMMARY
Headline earnings for the year reached record levels at $2,689 million
compared with $1,694 million in 2003 and headline earnings per
share increased by 57% to $1.88 per share. This performance
resulted from a particularly strong contribution from Base Metals
and significant increases from Ferrous Metals and Industries and
Coal. Platinum also increased its contribution. Industrial Minerals
headline earnings were marginally lower than last year. Lower
headline earnings were recorded by Paper and Packaging, reflecting
tougher market conditions. AngloGold Ashanti recorded lower
headline earnings due mainly to the impact of the stronger rand.

Profit for the year increased by 83% to $2,913 million compared
with $1,592 million in the prior year. The increased profit in 2004
was principally due to strong operational results, significant profits
on the sale of the Group’s non-core assets, including its holding in
Gold Fields Limited, and a net reduction in exceptional impairment
charges. These more than compensated for an increased net
interest charge and an increase in the effective tax rate.

The Group’s results are influenced by a variety of currencies due
to its geographic diversity. The South African rand in particular
strengthened considerably against the US dollar during the year
with an average exchange rate of $1:R6.44 compared with R7.55
in 2003. Currency movements adversely impacted headline
earnings by $385 million. This was more than offset by the
positive impact of increased prices amounting to $1,661 million.
EXCEPTIONAL ITEMS
Operating exceptional charges amounted to $92 million. 
These included an impairment of $100 million to the carrying
value of Black Mountain in Base Metals and the Group’s share,
$117 million, of an impairment in Palabora, an associate of Base
Metals. Impairments were partially offset by the $154 million
reversal of a previous impairment of Terra Industries Inc. 
Non-operating exceptional gains amounted to $520 million. 
These included $464 million of profit from the sale of the
Group’s holding in Gold Fields Limited.
INTEREST
The net interest charge increased from $319 million in the prior
year to $359 million in 2004. The increase reflects higher
average net debt levels during 2004 compared with the average
during 2003.
TAXATION 
The effective rate of taxation before exceptional items was
30%, compared to 29% in 2003. This change in the effective
rate was due to a number of one-off tax benefits arising in
2003 and a change in the mix of earnings contributed by the
Group’s businesses.
BALANCE SHEET
Total shareholders’ funds were $24,998 million compared with
$19,772
(1)
million as at 31 December 2003. The increase was
primarily due to retained earnings and the appreciation of the
South African rand and other local currencies against the US dollar.
Net debt was $8,121 million, a decrease of $512 million 
from 2003. Net debt at 31 December 2004 comprised 
$10,782 million of debt, offset by $2,661 million of cash 
and current asset investments. Net debt to total capital as 
at 31 December 2004 was 21.5%, compared with 27.1%
(1)
in 2003. Further information on net debt is given on 
page 15.
CASH FLOW 
Net cash inflow from operations was $4,773 million compared
with $3,184 million in 2003. EBITDA was $7,110 million, 
a substantial increase of 49% from $4,785 million in 2003.
Depreciation and amortisation, which increased by $660 million
to $2,123 million, are analysed opposite.
Acquisitions expenditure accounted for an outflow of 
$1,119 million compared with $1,469 million in 2003. The
Group has increased its interests in Anglo Platinum to 74.8%
and, following the merger of AngloGold and Ashanti Goldfields,
purchased further shares in AngloGold Ashanti to restore 
the Group’s holding to 51%. The Group has also acquired the
remaining 30% minority interest in Frantschach AG.
Proceeds from disposals, excluding sale of other investments,
totalled $1,863 million, with $1,180 million from the sale of 
the Group’s holding in Gold Fields Limited, $246 million cash
consideration from the sale of Hudson Bay Mining and Smelting
Co Ltd and $255 million from the sale of the Group’s interest 
in Terra Industries Inc. Net proceeds from the sale of other
investments totalled $263 million, including the sale of the 
Group’s remaining stake in FirstRand Limited, part disposal 
of the Group’s interest in Western Areas and sale of the 
Group’s interest in Avgold.

Anglo Platinum’s operating profit rose by 24% to $537 million.
This was largely due to improved prices and greater sales volumes,
though partially offset by the strength of the rand, which raised
costs in dollar terms.
Markets
The average dollar price realised for the basket of metals sold
equated to $1,194 per platinum ounce sold, 25.9% greater than
in 2003, with improved platinum, rhodium and nickel prices making
the largest contribution. The average realised price for platinum
of $842 per ounce was $146 higher, while rhodium prices
climbed from $527 to $933 per ounce, with nickel rising from
$4.07 per pound to $5.92.
Operating performance
Refined platinum production increased by 6.3% to 2.45 million
ounces. The increase was due mainly to improved smelting
recoveries, additional production from the mines and the
commencement of the Western Limb Tailings Retreatment 
Plant in January 2004.
Cash operating costs per equivalent refined ounce of platinum
rose to $784 following a 9.2% increase in rand unit costs and
the strength of the rand against the dollar, which raised costs 
in dollar terms. Mining unit costs were adversely affected by
production lost to a wage strike in October, the ongoing
substitution of higher grade Merensky production with UG2
production and difficult geological conditions at Amandelbult 
and Modikwa which, while anticipated, had a greater impact 
than expected. Cost performance at the processing operations
was excellent and the overall smelting and refining unit cost
decreased in rand terms. The restructuring initiative has made
good progress to the stage where sustainable cost savings will
be realised from 2005. During 2004, a total of $80 million 
was achieved in cost saving initiatives.
In May 2004, Anglo Platinum successfully concluded a rights offer
of convertible perpetual cumulative preference shares, which
raised $599 million. Anglo American subscribed for the rights
offer, investing $459 million. The proceeds were used to reduce
short term borrowings. Net debt has decreased from $1,038
million at the end of 2003 to $608 million. Capital expenditure
for 2004 amounted to $633 million (2003: $1,004 million).
Operations at the Anglo Platinum Converting Process were stable
and in line with planned production build-ups, with significantly
reduced sulphur emissions. The Polokwane Smelter recovered
well from the cooler failure and overall performance for the 
year was good. The Western Limb Tailings Retreatment Plant
commissioned at the end of 2003 achieved a rapid build-up 
of tonnage and is continuing towards maximising recoveries. 
The Kroondal Platinum Mine, jointly mined with Aquarius
Platinum, is operating well and made a useful contribution 
to Anglo Platinum’s performance for the year. Negotiations 
in respect of other joint ventures are continuing.
Anglo Platinum continues to work closely with South Africa’s
Department of Minerals and Energy and good progress is being
made towards meeting the requirements of the Mineral and
Petroleum Resources Development Act and the Broad Based
Economic Empowerment Charter. The conversion of ‘old order’
mineral rights to ‘new order’ rights in accordance with the
requirements of the new Act has begun.

FINANCIAL REVIEW
CONTINUED
Outlook 
Anglo Platinum remains confident of the robustness of current
and future demand for platinum and will continue its expansion
programme. In line with its stated policy of implementing only
those projects which meet its investment hurdle rate and, with
the unlikely prospect of higher rand prices in the short term, the
rate of implementation of the expansion programme has been
adjusted. Current plans for 2005 indicate refined platinum
production of 2.6 million ounces. While Anglo Platinum remains
flexible with regard to the rate of expansion, the revised
implementation is expected to result in refined platinum
production in 2006 of between 2.7 and 2.8 million ounces.
Demand for platinum continues to be strong and, given the existing
currency environment and the outlook for supply, is supportive of
a platinum price at levels of $800 per ounce and above.

Total operating profit before exceptional items was 29% lower 
at $263 million (2003: $369 million). The average spot price 
of $409 per ounce for the year was $46 per ounce or 12.7%
stronger than for 2003. However, the South African rand
strengthened against the dollar by some 15% during the year
and the average local price of R84,700 per kilogram was 4%
lower than for 2003. Despite the increase in the average dollar
gold price and a rise in gold output, total cash costs were 
$54 per ounce higher, at $268 per ounce, mainly due to
stronger operating currencies and lower grades. Efficiency
improvements and cost saving initiatives totalled $63 million.
Gold production was 8% higher at 6.05 million ounces, attributable
largely to the merger with Ashanti Goldfields, completed on 
26 April, as well as higher production at Sunrise Dam in Australia
and Cripple Creek & Victor in the US. These increases were
offset by the disposal of Jerritt Canyon in the US and the closure
of Union Reefs in Australia, as well as reduced production from
South Africa. 
Markets
The return of investor interest in gold during the third quarter of
2004 produced a sustained rise in the gold price, and the final
quarter of the year produced a spot gold price of $457 per ounce,
the highest price seen in almost 17 years. The driving influence
on investor sentiment remained the weakening of the US dollar,
particularly against the euro, but also against the Japanese yen.
This has been the case throughout the past three and a half year
rise in the spot price of gold and it underlines the primary influence
of the health of the US currency on the gold price in this current
gold market cycle.
The physical market for gold during 2004 showed some positive
moves. Against the background of a long term downward trend
in the crucial area of demand for gold jewellery, there was
improved offtake in the Middle East and in south east Asia and
sustained demand in India. In China, sales of modern 18 carat gold
jewellery in metropolitan markets grew sharply. 
Operating performance 
The merger with Ashanti Goldfields brought to AngloGold 
a substantial gold ore reserve. The challenge now is to ensure
that these operations, starved of working capital for an extended
period, realise their ore reserve, profit margin potential and
growth potential.
In addition to current growth projects, which will have the effect
of maintaining the AngloGold Ashanti annual production profile of
some 6.5 million ounces through to around 2012, management
is focused on growing the reserve and resource base. This growth
will be achieved through exploration and a disciplined, value
adding mergers and acquisitions programme, concentrating outside
of the world’s mature gold regions. In terms of this new frontiers
policy, joint ventures have been formed in Russia with London
based Trans-Siberian Gold, in the Philippines with Australian
listed company Red 5 and, in Laos, where AngloGold Ashanti
has formed an exploration alliance with Oxiana. In Mongolia, the
company has an exploration team on the ground and is acquiring
land positions in several prospective areas. In the Democratic
Republic of Congo, the company has been active for several
months establishing a base in the north east of the country. 
The company has also established an office in Colombia and other
prospective areas in Central America are under consideration.
Outlook
The weakening of the US currency has been the primary driver of
the gold price rise over the past three and a half years and the
gold price correlation with the dollar remains an important one
for the year ahead. Against this background, the gold price is
expected to trade in the current range or higher in 2005.

De Beers is an independently managed associate of the Group. The Group’s share of 
De Beers’ net assets is disclosed. The figures for the Group’s share of net operating assets
shown for other businesses relate to the Group’s subsidiaries only.
The Group’s share of total operating profit from De Beers
increased by $24 million over the 2003 figure to $586 million.
Diamond stocks at year end were at a similar level to that
reported at the end of 2003.
Markets
Overall, 2004 was another good year for the diamond industry.
Against the background of accelerating economic growth in the
major diamond consuming countries, diamond jewellery sales
performed well. Preliminary indications are that global retail sales
of diamond jewellery for the year as a whole were about 6%
higher than the previous year in local currency and, because of
the continued weakening of the dollar, about 8% higher in
dollars. Strong areas of growth were Asia-Pacific, India and the
Gulf region, with Japan also recording modest growth for the
second year running. The US, accounting for over 50% of world
diamond jewellery sales, had a solid Christmas season overall,
despite concerns over high personal debt levels.
7878v03_PH_Rp_FC-p27_020305.qxp  4/3/05  2:05 am  Page 08 Anglo American plc Annual Report 2004 09
During the year, levels of polished stocks in the cutting centres
declined, but cutting centre bank debt continued to climb in line
with the increase in the volume of trade. However, the lending
banks seem reasonably comfortable with the ability of the trade
to finance the higher level of debt.
There was strong demand for rough diamonds from the cutting
centres throughout the year and full year sales by The Diamond
Trading Company (DTC), the marketing arm of De Beers, were
$5,695 million, 3% higher than in 2003. During the year, the
DTC raised its rough diamond prices on three occasions, the
cumulative effect being that sales by the DTC in 2004 were at
prices, on average, 14% higher than in 2003. The DTC had a
strong first sight in 2005 at which it raised its rough diamond
prices by a further 3% on the evidence of the underlying demand
growth achieved in 2004 and anticipated in 2005.
Operating performance
Despite De Beers group diamond production being significantly
below target in the first half of the year, the deficit was more
than made up in the second six months. Production for the year,
inclusive of its joint ventures in Botswana and Namibia, totalled
47 million carats, 3 million carats (7%) more than in 2003.
Debswana produced a record 31.1 million carats, an increase 
of 2% over 2003, notwithstanding experiencing a number of
operational difficulties and industrial action. Namdeb’s production
of 1.86 million carats was 28% higher and included record marine
production of 865,000 carats.
De Beers’ South African mines produced a total of 13.7 million
carats in 2004, an increase of 1.8 million carats (15%) on
2003. Mainly because of the new Combined Treatment Plant,
Kimberley Mines produced a record 2 million carats, a production
level last achieved 90 years ago, in 1914. Although rand mining
costs per tonne were lower than in 2003, the weakness of the
dollar, the currency in which diamonds are sold, has put 
De Beers’ older and more marginal mines under continued
pressure, with five of its seven mines operating at a loss.
Management continues to focus its efforts on further reducing
costs and driving efficiencies throughout its operations.
De Beers recently reached agreement with the Government of
the Republic of Botswana (GRB) for the renewal of the Jwaneng
mining licence for a further 25 year period from 1 August 2004
and the extension of the Orapa, Damtshaa and Letlhakane
mining licences to the same end date. De Beers and the GRB
have also agreed that the 15% holding in De Beers’ ultimate
holding company, DB Investments, previously owned by
Debswana, be directly owned by GRB. 
De Beers has made a number of commitments to the European
Commission regarding its proposed trade agreement with the
Russian diamond producer, Alrosa. De Beers believes that it has
now addressed the concerns raised by the Commission and looks
forward to having the commitments formally accepted by the
Commission in the near future.
The reorganisation of De Beers’ South African assets is now in the
process of being implemented. Accordingly, De Beers Consolidated
Mines Limited should be in a position to implement a black
economic empowerment transaction during 2005.
Outlook
2005 is likely to be a more challenging year for the diamond
industry. However, with the transformation of the industry that
has taken place over the last few years, there is now growing
evidence that diamonds are competing favourably with other
luxury products.

Anglo Base Metals generated record operating profits before
exceptional items of $1,275 million (2003: $286 million)
following record production of copper, nickel, zinc and mineral
sands products and significantly higher base metals prices. While 
on-mine cost control remained tight, margins were adversely
affected by increased prices in areas such as energy, explosives,
chemicals, freight, insurance and, in the copper concentrate market,
a significant increase in treatment and refining charges. However,
$47 million was realised from efficiency improvements and cost
saving initiatives, partly offsetting the increased operating costs.
Markets
2004 witnessed a record performance on the back of a sustained
rebound in world economic growth. Strong growth in metals
demand, together with relatively constrained supply increases,
resulted in metal market deficits and lower inventories. This,
together with a weakening of the US dollar and significant
speculative fund interest, propelled US dollar base metals prices 
to multi-year highs. 
Operating performance
The copper division’s operating profit before exceptional items
was $1,046 million (2003: $269 million) as a result of its
highest ever attributable copper production of 766,000 tonnes
(2003: 708,800 tonnes) and a higher average copper price
received of 133 US cents/lb (2003: 81 US cents/lb). Los Bronces
produced a record 231,600 tonnes on the back of higher mining
rates and grades and improved metallurgical recoveries. Attributable
production from Collahuasi was a record 211,600 tonnes, mainly
due to higher tonnages treated through the concentrator following
the Rosario project commissioning. 
The Rosario transition project was successfully completed five
weeks ahead of schedule at a capital cost of $627 million
(budget $654 million) and its mill throughput has consistently
exceeded design capacity of 110,000 tonnes per day. The
$80 million El Soldado pit extension project, approved during 
the year, will extend mine life by more than 20 years. The
$21 million Chagres de-bottlenecking project, which increases
production capacity from 162,000 tonnes per annum to
184,000 tonnes per annum of anode/blister, was also approved
during the year and will be built and commissioned during 2005.
The construction of a $47 million molybdenum plant with a
capacity of 6,700 tonnes per annum at Punta Patache was
approved by Collahuasi and will enter production in 2006.
Scoping studies for significant increases in production are 
under way at both Collahuasi and Los Bronces.

FINANCIAL REVIEW
CONTINUED
The Minera Sur Andes operations generated an operating profit of
$511 million. Current indications are that the remaining $86 million
of the contingent purchase price will be paid in May 2005. 
The Group’s share of an impairment of Palabora amounted to
$117 million.
The nickel, niobium and mineral sands division generated an
operating profit of $224 million (2003: $106 million), on the
back of attributable nickel production of 24,000 tonnes and 
an average nickel price received of 617 US cents/lb (2003: 
403 US cents/lb). Production at both Loma de Níquel and
Codemin was essentially unchanged, while niobium production
rose slightly. At Namakwa, rutile and zircon production grew by
16% and 28% respectively as the operation recovered from the
after-effects of the mineral separation plant fire in the second
half of 2003. All operations saw significant upward pressure on
costs due to currency effects, the rising prices of key inputs such
as power, fuel oil, aluminium powder and anthracite, and, in
Brazil, the imposition of new taxes. 
The 25% interest in the Nkomati joint venture was sold for 
$37 million and Codemin became a wholly-owned subsidiary
following the purchase of the outstanding 10% of the company.
The $67 million Codemin 2 project which will increase nickel
production to in excess of 10,000 tonnes per annum, was
commissioned on time and on budget and will ramp up to full
capacity during the first quarter of 2005. The Barro Alto
feasibility study will be completed in 2005.
The zinc division’s operating profit before exceptional items was 
$38 million (2003: $62 million loss) following zinc production
of 410,700 tonnes and an average zinc price received of 
48 US cents/lb (2003: 38 US cents/lb). Skorpion mine entered
commercial production in May 2004. The operation produced
119,200 tonnes of zinc during 2004 and achieved 95% of
capacity by year end. Lisheen saw lower production of zinc and
lead due to lower grades and reduced mining rates ahead of 
the commissioning of the pastefill plant which commenced in
October 2004. Black Mountain continued to experience lack of
mining flexibility ahead of the Deeps orebody entering production.
Mill throughput was maintained and zinc production rose 9% 
but lower grades resulted in lead production of 37,500 tonnes
(2003: 39,600 tonnes). Currency effects at all operations 
placed significant upward pressure on costs.
The sinking of both the main and ventilation shafts at Black
Mountain is complete and hoisting operations commenced in early
2005. The development of the Deeps mine and the ramping up
of zinc production will continue throughout 2005. The final
estimated cost of the project is $125 million, against a budget
of $110 million, as a result of the strength of the rand.
Hudson Bay, which contributed $37 million to operating profit 
in 2004, was sold in December for $257 million, resulting in a 
$42 million loss on the sale. A decision was also made to impair
the carrying value of Black Mountain by $100 million.
Outlook
A weaker dollar and low metal inventories should provide a solid
support to dollar-denominated prices. Nonetheless, some base
metals markets could move towards balance or even into surplus
in the second half as price-induced supply increases gather pace.

Ferrous Metals and Industries lifted operating profit before
exceptional items to record levels in 2004, from $208 million 
to $895 million. The business benefited from improved prices for
iron ore, manganese, ferrochrome, steel and vanadium. In addition,
significant progress was made in efficiency improvements and 
cost saving initiatives which totalled $103 million.
Markets
World crude steel production in 2004 increased by 8.8% over
2003, while China produced 272.5 million tonnes of crude steel,
an increase of 23.2%. The South African steel market was also
characterised by strong local demand, rising by 20%.
In respect of Terra, a previous impairment of $154 million 
was released during the year as an operating exceptional gain.
Anglo American’s entire shareholding in Terra was sold for 
$255 million, resulting in an exceptional gain of $13 million. 
In January 2005, Highveld Steel and Samancor sold half of their
shareholdings in Acerinox. Anglo American’s attributable share of
the proceeds was $69 million. In February 2005, Anglo American
and BHP Billiton announced that they had reached agreement 
for the sale of their respective 40% and 60% shareholdings in
Samancor Chrome for an enterprise value of $469 million.
Operating performance
Kumba’s contribution to Anglo American’s operating profit before
exceptional items was $205 million (as a subsidiary) compared
with $33 million in 2003 (representing a 20.1% attributable
equity interest for ten months and as a subsidiary for one month).
This performance reflected higher commodity prices, solid
operational performances and margin-improvement initiatives,
countered to some extent by the strong rand. The global market
for seaborne iron ore increased by an estimated 95 million tonnes
in 2004. Kumba’s iron ore operations benefited from an average
19% annual increase in dollar denominated prices, with effect
from 1 April 2004, and further significant increases are anticipated
in 2005. Its Sishen and Thabazimbi mines produced a total 
of 30.1 million tonnes of iron ore during the year, of which 
20.9 million tonnes were exported. 
7878v03_PH_Rp_FC-p27_020305.qxp  4/3/05  2:06 am  Page 10 Anglo American plc Annual Report 2004 11
Regarding Kumba's Hope Downs iron ore project in Australia, which
has been the subject of a dispute with a local partner, Kumba is
appealing a recent arbitration decision. Subject to Kumba’s rights
of appeal, the process for determining a fair value, at which the
local partner can elect to acquire Kumba’s project interest, has
commenced. Until Kumba’s participation in the project is finally
resolved, it continues to perform its contractual obligations in
respect of the project.
Scaw Metals’ operating profit was $101 million (2003: 
$70 million). This was achieved against a background of greatly
increased international steelmaking raw material prices and
resulting input cost increases, offset to some extent by high
selling prices. Production was higher, with strong performances
in most divisions. Import competition, however, aided by the
strong rand and weak dollar, continued to have a negative effect
on some of Scaw’s downstream businesses.
The attributable share of Samancor’s operating profit amounted to
$236 million (2003: $41 million). The manganese business had
an outstanding year, benefiting from improved market conditions
as a result of product shortages, driven primarily by Chinese crude
steel production. This led to significantly higher alloy prices being
achieved in 2004. The chrome operations benefited similarly from
higher ferrochrome prices, offset to some extent by the strong rand.
Highveld Steel had a record year with an operating profit of 
$168 million (2003: $11 million). This was largely due to
higher prices for steel, vanadium and manganese alloys,
together with increased volumes sold into the South African
market. Production costs were well controlled and cost savings 
of $38 million were achieved, resulting in substantially higher
operating margins. Ferrovanadium prices rose from historically
low levels in early 2003 of $6/kgV to recent levels of $52/kgV. 
Boart Longyear’s operating profits totalled $67 million (2003:
$33 million). Product and contracting results in the Americas and
Asia-Pacific were substantially better than 2003 owing to much
higher drilling activity, while those in sub-Saharan Africa improved
as a result of increased sales of rockdrills and capital equipment.
The Hardmaterials and Wendt operations benefited from
restructurings undertaken in 2003, and Wendt also profited from
increased machine sales as a result of the improved business
environment. The European business continued to struggle, posting
a loss for the full year.
Tongaat-Hulett’s operating profit was $69 million (2003: 
$10 million). The aluminium division performed well on the back
of increased volumes, an improved product mix and reduced costs,
while the sugar division’s profitability was negatively impacted by
the relatively small South African sugar crop. Import competition
and higher maize input costs adversely affected the starch and
glucose operations. Moreland Properties posted strong results,
capitalising on buoyant demand across all its portfolios. 
Terra generated an attributable operating profit before exceptional
items of $53 million (2003: $14 million), largely reflecting
higher nitrogen margins.
Outlook
Ferrous metals prices may soften in 2005 as anticipated Chinese
demand for steel slows. China’s domestic steel consumption
growth rate has reportedly fallen as the country shifts from being
the world’s biggest steel importer to a net exporter. The persistent
strength of the rand is expected to continue to affect margins
adversely in the coming year. Ferrous Metals and Industries will
continue to reshape its portfolio around core businesses, focusing
on increased iron ore output and improved margins through
greater operating efficiencies and cost saving initiatives.

Operating profit increased by 46% to $487 million, mainly due
to higher export prices and a 3 million tonne (3%) rise in sales. 
Markets
During the year, coal demand was strong and prices increased
markedly. Metallurgical coal prices were driven by robust steel
sector raw material demand, led by sustained Chinese economic
growth and rising imports, a tight supply situation and logistics
chain constraints. Healthy thermal coal offtake in China moderated
the level of Chinese exports. 
Power, oil, gas and thermal coal prices were influenced by
continued inefficiencies in the logistics chain, mainly affecting
South Africa and Australia, coupled with growing global energy
demand and security of supply concerns. Relatively small
imbalances in supply and demand continue to bring significant
price and directional uncertainty to the world’s energy and raw
material markets, especially for thermal coals. Spot South African
steam coal prices increased by 73% during the first six months
and, although they had reduced by 25% at year end, they remain
well above historic average price levels. 
Operating performance
Operating profit for South African sourced coal, at $244 million,
was 83% higher than in 2003 and export prices were up 42%.
The rand continued to strengthen against the dollar, reducing
headline earnings by $17 million.
Production rose by 5% to 54.5 million tonnes. This reflected
strong domestic demand from Eskom, the South African power
utility, which led Kriel and New Vaal collieries to produce at
record levels. Plans are in place to acquire additional mining
equipment for New Denmark, the other colliery serving the
domestic market, so that it can increase output substantially 
in 2005. Production at most of the export mines was slightly
higher, with the exception of Bank and Landau, where difficult
mining conditions affected production.
Capital expenditure in South Africa rose by $27 million, mainly
due to the development of Isibonelo colliery, due to start
production in 2005. Following the signing of a memorandum of
understanding with BHP Billiton relating to the Western Complex
reserves, a feasibility study is investigating the optimal use of
these reserves.
Operating profit for the Australian operations fell by 39% to
$79 million. This was mainly because production ceased at
Moranbah North Mine (MNM) for eight months following a roof
collapse at the tail end of the longwall face in January 2004. The
effects were partly mitigated by an estimated $40 million, the
proceeds from a related insurance claim. Gains from exchange-
rate hedges taken out during the year dampened some of the

CONTINUED
adverse effects of the stronger Australian dollar (up by 11%
against the US currency). Following the roof strata collapse at
MNM, the longwall was relocated. Production resumed in late
August and by year end production rates were reaching targeted
expectations. However, the colliery produced 2.3 million tonnes
less high-margin coking coal than the previous year. At Dartbrook,
output was marginally down and production at Drayton was in
line with the prior year, while Callide, Moura and Capcoal exceeded
previous performances, which together offset MNM's negative
volume impact. Aggregate attributable saleable coal production
was in line with the previous year, at 25.6 million tonnes.
Total attributable sales declined by 4% to 25.5 million tonnes,
though domestic sales increased by 0.7 million tonnes, mainly
driven by generating capacity demand. Export sales were further
limited by port constraints at Dalrymple Bay Coal Terminal,
though a port-allocation system at Newcastle has helped eliminate
ship congestion.
The Moura/Theodore/Dawson project was announced in December,
and is scheduled to commence in early 2005. Work continues 
on the feasibility study for Lake Lindsay, adjacent to the 
Capcoal complex. 
On 18 June, a Supreme Court decision on the Grasstree project’s
compliance with the Coal Mining Safety and Health Regulations
resulted in Grasstree suspending operations. This suspension was
lifted at the beginning of December and Grasstree remains on
schedule to start up during 2006. Dartbrook successfully made
the transition to the Kayuga seam during the first six months. 
Anglo Coal has now acquired all the shares in Australian Power
and Energy Limited (APEL) that it did not previously own. APEL
is conducting a pre-feasibility study into producing liquid fuel
from brown coal in Victoria.
Operating profit at the South American operations rose by 134%
to $164 million, following significantly improved coal prices and
a 9% increase in attributable sales volume, to 9.9 million tonnes.
These gains were partly offset by increases in fuel prices and
royalty payments and the effects of the weakening dollar. 
In addition, equipment availability at Venezuela's Carbones del
Guasare (CDG) was reduced by administration problems with
newly introduced exchange controls, although these appeared 
to be under control by the year end.
Cerrejón continues to expand its operations, with a production goal
of 28 million tonnes per annum by the end of 2006. Feasibility
studies on further expansion opportunities are under way at both
Cerrejón and CDG. 
In 2004, Anglo Coal realised $51 million from efficiency
improvements and cost saving initiatives.
Outlook
With MNM back in operation, improved production is expected 
in 2005. Rand and Australian dollar strength together with coal
prices will continue to be the two main variables. Metallurgical
coal prices have again risen substantially in negotiations for
2005, and high prices for thermal coals – notwithstanding their
reductions in the second half of 2004 – are expected to continue
in the current year.

Operating profit before exceptional items increased by 6% to
$346 million. Tarmac’s operating profit before exceptional items
declined by 3% to $280 million, mainly due to challenging
market conditions in the UK. In contrast, Copebrás benefited
from buoyant local market conditions and increased international
fertiliser prices which, together with the increased production from
the new plant, resulted in an 89% increase in operating profit.
Markets and operating performance
In the UK, markets were disappointing. Following the completion
of work on large projects such as the M6 toll road in 2003, demand
for asphalt was weaker, with little major contract activity during
the year. Aggregates demand was slightly lower, although concrete
volumes increased. Modest price improvements were achieved,
but these were insufficient to offset higher bitumen and fuel costs.
The benefits of Tarmac’s ongoing business improvement and
procurement programmes continued to be felt, with the group
achieving a total of $64 million in cost savings and efficiency
improvements, but these were partially offset by the disappointing
performance of Concrete Products.
By contrast, the cement business had a good year. The new
Buxton plant began operating in March, having been completed
at a cost of £110 million, £5 million below budget. The plant is
performing to expectations, which has resulted in a near-doubling
in contribution from this business. The mortar business also
performed well, assisted by recent investments in dry silo mortar
plants in Leeds, Glasgow and Coventry. As Tarmac continued to
develop its business in the UK, three acquisitions were completed
during the year, including that of David W Gordon Ltd, one of
Scotland’s leading concrete block producers. Significant investments
were also made in new plant, including a new ready-mixed concrete
plant at King’s Cross in London and the replant of a major
limestone quarry in South Yorkshire.
In continental Europe, operating profit grew by 9%. France
benefited from a strong private housing market, although the
public sector was more subdued. The businesses in Poland and
the Czech Republic experienced stronger market conditions. 
The latter also benefited from a first-time contribution from
Bilfinger Berger Baustoffe, which is performing above expectations.
During the year, Wisniowka, a well located high quality sandstone
quarry in central Poland, was acquired. This will enable the business
to benefit from anticipated Polish infrastructure projects. Operating
profit in Spain improved again despite weaker market conditions
in Madrid. The business on the Mediterranean coast, which 
was the main part of the Mavike acquisition in 2002, showed 
a substantial improvement. Weak market conditions, however,
continued in Germany.
7878v03_PH_Rp_FC-p27_020305.qxp  4/3/05  2:06 am  Page 12 Anglo American plc Annual Report 2004 13
The Middle East business experienced another year of substantial
growth. With its local partner, Tarmac is developing a new quarry
in the United Arab Emirates to supply this buoyant market. 
The Far East business continued to improve. At the end of the
year, a new quarry supplying the Shanghai market commenced
operation. Production will be ramped up during 2005.
Copebrás had an excellent year. Operating profit increased by
89%, due to continued strong Brazilian demand for phosphate
based fertilisers and higher international prices. The continuing
recovery of the South American economies also resulted in 
a significant improvement in sales volumes of sodium
tripolyphosphate (STPP), which is used in detergents.
Outlook
Market conditions in the UK are expected to remain extremely
challenging throughout 2005. Volumes are not expected to grow
significantly and the industry is facing cost increases arising mainly
from fossil fuel price rises and legislative compliance. Tarmac has
announced price increases for all its major products with effect
from the beginning of January. In addition, Tarmac’s performance
will be underpinned by continuing cost reductions and initiatives
to improve customer service. 
In continental Europe, healthy market conditions are expected 
in Poland and the Czech Republic as these economies continue
to grow. The short term outlook in Germany remains uncertain,
although in those major cities where the business is active, demand
is expected to remain stable. The run-up to the 2006 soccer
World Cup, which takes place in Germany, may provide a boost.
In Spain, although demand in Madrid may be weaker, continued
growth on the Mediterranean coast is expected. France is expected
to see modest improvement. In all regions, opportunities to invest
in the core product areas will continue to be examined, both in
existing and adjacent countries of focus. 
Local market conditions for fertilisers in Brazil remain buoyant
although there is some concern about lower international prices
for some agricultural commodities. However, the new plant at
Goiás, which is in the country’s interior and away from the threat
of imports, gives Copebrás a strong position in this market.

Headline earnings for Paper and Packaging for the year ended 31 December 2003
have been adjusted as net interest for wholly-owned operations in Paper and
Packaging is now accounted for centrally within Corporate Activities. See note 3
to the financial information.
Operating profit at $559 million was 15% lower than 2003. 
This reflected a significantly tougher trading environment than 
in 2003, particularly in the business paper sector, despite the
positive impact of increased volumes and cost reductions. 
Dollar reported results are improved by the translation impact 
of the stronger euro and rand. 
Operating performance
In November, Mondi announced the restructuring of its operations
into global product groups with the formation of two primary
business units, Mondi Packaging and Mondi Business Paper. 
The rebranding and reorganisation of the existing businesses
under the Mondi name has improved Mondi’s visibility to customers
and reduced its overhead cost structure. Mondi Packaging is a
combination of the Frantschach group, including Swiecie, with the
existing Mondi Packaging Europe group and the containerboard
machines at Syktyvkar and Richards Bay. Mondi Business Paper
incorporates Neusiedler and the South African uncoated woodfree
paper machines in Merebank, the pulp mill in Richards Bay and
the related forest operations. The balance of the Mondi group
consists of the South African packaging businesses, the European
paper merchant group Europapier, and the European and South
African newsprint businesses.
Mondi Packaging’s operating profit of $284 million was 6% below
that of 2003. The adverse impact of soft markets was not fully
offset by the positive impact of substantial cost savings and
profit improvement initiatives achieved in 2004 and the acquisition
of the Roman Bauernfeind business. This acquisition is performing
above expectation. The purchase of the remaining 30% minority
interest in Frantschach AG was completed in April.
Mondi Business Paper’s operating profit of $209 million fell
29% short of the previous year. Total production volumes
increased by 19% to 1,881,851 tonnes, with the PM18 
rebuild at Ruzomberok performing well. Production in South
Africa was affected by the planned March shutdown for the 
mill modernisation and expansion project – RB720. Production
output since the shutdown has been highly satisfactory and 
final commissioning of the pulp mill is currently progressing 
well. Office communication paper prices fell by 9% compared
with 2003, due to competitive markets and the adverse effects
of currency movements. These negative price impacts were,
however, countered by further cost savings and production
efficiency improvements. 
The balance of the Mondi operations performed in line with 2003,
with higher earnings at the paper merchant offset by lower
newsprint earnings, following the part disposal of the South African
newsprint assets in 2004.
Paper and Packaging delivered $144 million in cost savings and
productivity improvements during 2004, offsetting to a large
extent lower prices.
Other developments
The joint venture with Shanduka Resources (formerly MCI
Resources) in Mondi South Africa’s integrated newsprint business
was completed in the first half of 2004. Mondi retained a 58%
interest and this empowerment transaction allows for a further
8% in the newsprint business to be set aside for broad based
participation by Mondi South Africa employees and relevant
communities. Mondi has also sold, with effect from 1 January
2005, a 42% interest in its South African packaging businesses
to Shanduka Resources in an empowerment transaction, which
values the entire business at $370 million. There is a further
earn-out of $35 million in current terms if certain cash flow
projections are achieved over the next four years. A further 3%
will be set aside by Mondi for broad based participation by Mondi
South Africa employees.
In South Africa, the disposal of non-core assets is well advanced,
with a binding offer having been accepted for Mondi’s share 
in surplus plantations in the Eastern Cape. That transaction is
expected to be concluded during early 2005.

CONTINUED
Outlook
In 2005, Mondi will continue its product differentiation strategy,
capitalising on the recent expansion projects and innovation
programmes combined with further aggressive cost reduction
initiatives. If dollar weakness is sustained, this will continue 
to place pressure on European and South African prices. 
The impact on pricing should be largely offset by increased
volume from the Ruzomberok rebuild which will reach full
capacity in 2005 as well as the Richards Bay RB720 project
which is currently commissioning. 
EXPLORATION
The Group spent $120 million on exploration in 2004 – $41 million
on base metals, $9 million on coal, $14 million on ferrous metals,
$43 million at AngloGold Ashanti and $13 million at Anglo
Platinum.
Anglo Base Metals concentrated on brownfield exploration near
its mines in Chile, Brazil, Ireland, South Africa and Namibia. Drilling
identified additional copper resources at El Soldado and Los
Bronces in Chile. Other copper exploration took place in Mexico,
Peru, the Philippines and Brazil, while zinc exploration focused
on India and Australia. Nickel exploration continued around the
West Raglan sulphide discovery in northern Quebec as well 
as in Brazil and Finland. 
Anglo Coal's exploration stayed close to existing operations in
Australia, Colombia and South Africa. Prospecting for coal-bed
methane took place in South Africa and Australia, while the
Xiwan project in China’s Shaanxi province completed an
extensive initial drilling programme.
Anglo Ferrous Metals’ exploration activities all related to Kumba,
with most expenditure incurred on greenfield and brownfield iron
ore exploration in South Africa.
AngloGold Ashanti continued to explore around its mines in
Argentina, Australia, Brazil, Ghana, Guinea, Mali, Namibia,
South Africa, Tanzania and the US. In Asia, the company has an
exploration team on the ground in Mongolia, where it is acquiring
land positions in several prospective areas, and has set up an
exploration office in China. It has also established joint ventures
in the Philippines and Laos. In addition, its investment in Trans-
Siberian Gold provides opportunities for further growth in Russia.
Elsewhere, AngloGold Ashanti is exploring in prospective areas
of Peru, Colombia and Alaska and is establishing an exploration
base in the north east region of the Democratic Republic of Congo.
Anglo Platinum’s efforts focused on exploration in South Africa.
Elsewhere, its partners carried out programmes in Canada and
Russia, while a joint venture began to explore in the Sichuan
province of China. 
TREASURY MANAGEMENT AND HEDGING POLICY
The principal financial risks arising from the Group’s activities
are those related to commodity price risk, currency risk, interest
rate risk, counterparty risk and liquidity risk.
The Group’s principal treasury policies are set by the board. The
Group treasury acts as a service centre and operates within
clearly defined guidelines approved by the board. Anglo
American uses a number of derivative instruments to hedge
these financial risk exposures. The Anglo American accounting
department provides an independent control function to monitor
and report on treasury activities, which are also subject to
regular review by internal and external audit. 
The treasury of the Group’s associate, De Beers, is independently
managed as are those of the non-wholly-owned subsidiaries such
as AngloGold Ashanti and Anglo Platinum.
Commodity risk
Anglo American is exposed to movements in the price of precious
metals, base metals and other commodity products. Strategic
hedging of the price risk is undertaken from time to time and
derivatives are used to optimise the value of Anglo American’s
production of these commodities. Gold hedging is independently
managed by AngloGold Ashanti.
Currency risk
The Group publishes its financial statements in US dollars and 
a substantial proportion of the Group’s sales are denominated 
in US dollars. As a result, a large component of the Group’s net
debt is denominated in US dollars. However, the Group conducts
business in many currencies and, as a result, it is subject to
currency risks owing to exchange rate movements which will
affect the Group’s costs and the translation of the profits of
subsidiaries, joint ventures and associates whose functional
currency is not the US dollar. 
Anglo American retains a significant proportion of its assets within
subsidiaries, joint ventures and associates located in countries,
principally South Africa, where the local currency is treated as
the functional currency and is used for reporting purposes. 
In the consolidated financial statements, the exchange differences
arising on the translation of net assets of these non-dollar
denominated subsidiaries, joint ventures and associates less any
offsetting exchange differences on foreign currency financing 
of these assets, are dealt with in reserves in accordance with
SSAP 20 ‘Foreign currency translation’. Accordingly, the currency
translation differences of $2,512 million recorded in note 25 
have been reported through the consolidated statement of 
total recognised gains and losses on page 50 and appear as an
increase in shareholders’ funds. These differences do not affect
the consolidated profit and loss account or the consolidated 
cash flow statement.
The currency translation differences which have arisen are mainly
attributable to the appreciation of the South African rand against
the US dollar since 1 January 2004, although the appreciation of
the Australian dollar, euro and sterling against the US dollar have
also contributed. If the rand and other currencies appreciate or
depreciate against the US dollar in future reporting periods,
currency translation differences will continue to appear as an
increase or a reduction in shareholders’ funds, respectively.
The non-dollar denominated businesses actually derive the
majority of their revenues in dollars, while the majority of their
costs continue to be incurred in their local currency. To this
extent, the currency appreciation does not impact on the real
underlying value of the non-dollar denominated assets within
these businesses. 
However, although revenues are mainly denominated in US
dollars, operating costs are incurred mainly in local currencies so
the Group profitability and cash flow is exposed to exchange rate
movements between local currencies and the US dollar.

Interest rate risk
The Group is exposed to interest rate risk, in particular to changes
in US dollar, rand, sterling and euro interest rates. Corporate policy
is to maintain a high proportion of floating rate debt, although
strategic hedging using fixed rate debt may be undertaken from
time to time if considered appropriate. At 31 December 2004,
the Group had fixed rate debt of $2,199 million, representing
27.1% of net debt (2003: 28.4%). The policy is to invest cash 
at floating rates of interest and cash reserves are maintained in
relatively short term investments in order to maintain liquidity
while achieving a satisfactory return for shareholders.
Counterparty risk
Cash deposits and other financial instruments give rise to credit
risk on the amounts due from counterparties. The Group controls
and monitors the distribution of these exposures against approved
limits to minimise the risk of loss in the event of non-performance
by a counterparty. The limits involved relate to minimum credit
ratings, exposure limits and shareholders’ equity. The possibility
of material loss arising in the event of non-performance by 
a counterparty is considered unlikely.
Liquidity risk and financing
The Group is assigned short term ratings of P-2 and A-2, and
long term ratings of A3 (stable outlook) and A- (stable outlook)
from Moody’s and Standard and Poor’s respectively. 
The following financing activities were undertaken during 2004:
Anglo American Capital plc and Anglo American Australia Finance
Limited issued a number of small private placements. (All notes
are guaranteed by Anglo American plc).
A $1,000 million European Commercial Paper Programme was
established in October 2004. The programme provides further
funding diversity and flexibility. The European Commercial Paper
Programme is in addition to a $1,300 million Canadian Commercial
Paper Programme established a number of years ago.
In addition to its capital market activities, Anglo American borrows
using short term variable rate instruments such as commercial
paper, bills and money market lines, as well as using committed
medium and short term bank facilities. Anglo American maintains
committed facilities as back up to its commercial paper programmes
and for immediate liquidity needs. An existing $2.25 billion
committed facility was refinanced in 2004. A new $2.5 billion
committed facility was set up, incorporating a $750 million
tranche maturing in July 2005 and a $1,750 million tranche
maturing in July 2009.
Non-wholly-owned subsidiaries in general will arrange and maintain
their own financing and funding requirements. In most cases the
financing will be non-recourse to Anglo American. In addition,
certain projects are financed by means of limited recourse project
finance, if appropriate. 
It is believed that the Group’s net cash flow from operations, 
its holdings of cash and cash equivalents and access to credit
facilities and capital markets will be sufficient to cover the likely
short and long term cash requirements of the Group. At the end
of 2004, net debt was $8,121 million, being gross debt of
$10,782 million offset by $2,661 million of cash and current asset
investments. At 31 December 2004, the Group had available
undrawn, committed borrowing facilities totalling $4,921 million.
The maturity profile for the Group’s available undrawn, committed
borrowing facilities is as follows:

OTHER RISK FACTORS
The risk factors set out below are further uncertainties that the
Group considers could cause the Group’s actual results to differ
materially from expected and historical results:
Economic and political risks
The Group is geographically diverse and encounters different
legal and regulatory requirements in different jurisdictions.
Businesses may be affected by any political, economic or
regulatory developments in any of the countries in which they
operate, including risks such as restrictions on the export of
currency or expropriation of assets. The Group has no control
over changes in local inflation rates or market interest rates.
Acquisitions
The Group has undertaken a number of acquisitions in the past.
With these, as with any such future transaction, there is the risk
that any benefits or synergies identified at acquisition may not
be achieved. Rigorous guidelines are applied to the evaluation
and execution of all acquisitions, which require approval of the
Investment Committee and Executive Board and, in the case of
acquisitions beyond a certain value, the approval of the board.

FINANCIAL REVIEW
CONTINUED
Health, safety and environment
The Group is subject to numerous health, safety and environmental
laws and regulations in each of the jurisdictions in which it
operates. Any changes in laws, regulations or community
expectations can result in increased compliance and remediation
costs. The HIV/AIDS epidemic in sub-Saharan Africa is a significant
threat to economic growth and development. Providing access to
treatment in developing countries has become a humanitarian as
well as an economic and social imperative. In 2002, the Group
announced it would provide anti-retroviral therapy to employees
with HIV/AIDS.
Natural risks
The Group’s operations can be exposed to natural risks such 
as flood, weather or difficult geological conditions. Appropriate
insurance can provide protection from some, but not all, of the
costs that may arise from unforeseen events.
CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES
The Group financial statements are prepared in accordance with
UK GAAP. The Group’s accounting policies are described on
pages 52 to 53 of the financial statements. The application of
certain of these policies requires assumptions or judgements 
by management. Actual results may differ from the estimates
calculated using these assumptions and judgements. Management
believes that the following are the critical policies where the
assumptions and judgements made could have a significant impact
on the consolidated financial statements:
Pensions and post-retirement benefits
The expected costs of providing pensions and post-retirement
benefits under defined benefit arrangements are charged against
profits to spread the expected costs on a straight-line basis over
the service lives of the employees entitled to those benefits.
Assumptions in respect of the expected costs are set after
consultation with qualified actuaries. While management believes
the assumptions used are appropriate, a change in the assumptions
used would impact the earnings of the Group.
Restoration, rehabilitation and environmental costs
Provision is made, based on net present values, for restoration,
rehabilitation and environmental costs as soon as the obligation
arises. Costs incurred at the start of each project are capitalised
and charged to the profit and loss account over the life of the
project through depreciation of the asset and the unwinding of
the discount on the provision. Costs for restoration of subsequent
site damage are provided at net present value and charged against
profits as extraction progresses. Management uses its judgement
and experience to provide for and amortise these estimated costs.
Mining reserves
The Group’s mining properties are depreciated over the life of
the mine using the unit of production method based on proven
and probable reserves. When determining reserves, assumptions
that were valid at the time of estimation may change when new
information becomes available. Any changes could affect
depreciation rates and asset carrying values.
Exceptional items
Operating exceptional items are those that management considers,
by virtue of their size or incidence, should be disclosed separately
to ensure that the financial information also allows an understanding
of the underlying performance of the business. The determination
as to which items should be disclosed separately requires a
degree of judgement.
INTERNATIONAL FINANCIAL REPORTING STANDARDS
The Council of the European Union announced in June 2002 that
listed companies in Europe would be required to adopt International
Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) for accounting periods
beginning on or after 1 January 2005. The adoption of IFRS will
be first reflected in the Group’s financial statements for the half
year ended 30 June 2005 and the year ended 31 December 2005.
The accounting standards to be adopted are subject to ongoing
review and endorsement by the EU and possible amendment by
interpretative guidance from the International Financial Reporting
Interpretations Committee (IFRIC) and the accounting profession.
The information presented below has been prepared on the basis
of current interpretations of standards expected to be applied by
the Group in its 2005 financial statements.
The Group began preparation for the adoption of IFRS in April
2003 when it established a global project team to manage the
convergence to IFRS. The scope of this project included: 
an assessment of the impact from the conversion to IFRS on
the Group’s reported financial results;
a continued assessment of the impact from proposed future
developments to international accounting standards; 
identification of changes required to the Group’s existing
accounting systems and procedures;
targeted training and education of all appropriate employees 
within our businesses; and
the timely communication to internal and external stakeholders
of areas subject to significant change.
The IFRS transition project is well advanced and the Group is 
on track to meet its reporting deadlines. All significant project
milestones, including system changes and targeted IFRS training for
all employees affected by the transition, have now been completed.
The Group has prepared IFRS accounting and treasury policies in
accordance with standards expected to be effective, or available
for early adoption, as at 31 December 2005, the date of the
Group’s first annual IFRS financial statements. 
The Audit Committee has approved the Group’s first time adoption
choices made in accordance with IFRS 1, including the adoption of
International Accounting Standards (IAS) 32 Financial Instruments:
Disclosure and Presentation and IAS 39 Financial Instruments:
Recognition and Measurement prospectively from 1 January 2005.
The UK GAAP balance sheet as at 1 January 2004 and financial
information for the six months ended 30 June 2004 and year
ended 31 December 2004 will be restated in accordance with
these first-time accounting choices and policies (excluding IAS
32 and 39). The 2004 restated financial information at each of
these reporting dates will be published in May 2005. This
publication will include a reconciliation of the Group’s UK GAAP
reported profit and loss account, balance sheet and total equity
to the restated IFRS results, and will provide details of material
policy differences and adjustments arising.
First-time adoption choices
The Group has made the following first-time accounting policy
choices, in accordance with IFRS 1:
business combinations – acquisitions prior to 1 January 2004 will
not be restated;
goodwill – the requirement to retranslate goodwill balances to
the exchange rate at reporting date in accordance with IAS 21
The Effects of Changes in Foreign Exchange Rates will be
applied prospectively to goodwill balances arising on
acquisitions after 1 January 2004 (the transition date); 
7878v03_PH_Rp_FC-p27_020305.qxp  2/3/05  11:52 pm  Page 16 Anglo American plc Annual Report 2004 17
post-retirement benefits – surpluses/deficits of post-retirement
benefits under defined benefit arrangements will be recognised
in full at 1 January 2004. From 1 January 2004, the Group will
apply the full provision accounting method, as permitted in IAS 19
(revised) Employee Benefits, with subsequent actuarial gains
and losses being recorded directly in equity;
currency translation differences – translation differences relating
to foreign currency investments in subsidiaries, associates and
joint ventures are deemed to be zero at the date of transition
and, as such, the gain or loss on subsequent disposal of any
foreign operation will exclude translation differences that arose
before that date;
joint venture entities – these entities will be proportionally
consolidated in accordance with IAS 31 Interests in Joint Ventures;
financial instruments – IAS 32 and 39 will be applied
prospectively from 1 January 2005;
share-based payments – IFRS 2 Share-Based Payment will be
applied to all share-based rewards made after 7 November 2002
that did not vest before 1 January 2005;
disposal groups – IFRS 5 Non-Current Assets Held for Sale and
Discontinued Operations will be applied from 1 January 2005;
exploration for and evaluation of mineral resources – IFRS 6
Exploration for and Evaluation of Mineral Resources will be
applied early, from 1 January 2005.
Key policy impacts
Although the majority of accounting standards to be applied in
the Group’s first full IFRS financial statements have been finalised,
the principles may still be subject to possible amendment as a
result of additional interpretative guidance from IFRIC and the
accounting profession. 
A summary of the more significant accounting policy changes 
we anticipate will arise, based on current interpretations of the
standards within each of these areas, is provided below. Our
assessment may be subject to revision as a result of new
accounting developments and is not a comprehensive list of 
all expected changes. 
Business combinations, intangible assets and goodwill
The more significant policy changes resulting from the transition 
to IFRS include:
the replacement of goodwill amortisation with an annual 
impairment test;
the treatment of goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on
acquisition of foreign operations as assets and liabilities of 
the acquiree, to be retranslated on consolidation in accordance
with IAS 21;
the abolition of merger accounting;
a broader definition of intangible assets to be recognised
at acquisition; and
the reclassification of minority interests from liabilities to equity.
Financial instruments
The adoption of IAS 32 and 39 will require all derivatives, with the
exception of commodity based (normal purchase or normal sale)
contracts, to be recognised on the balance sheet at fair value.
Subsequent changes in fair values are either taken to equity, 
if the criteria for cash flow hedge accounting are met, or to the
income statement. Previously, derivatives qualifying as hedges in
accordance with UK GAAP have been held off balance sheet and
the fair value disclosed within a note to the financial statements.
Any derivatives embedded within the terms of contractual
commitments that are not considered closely related to the
underlying host contract will also be separately identified and
fair valued.
Commodity based (normal purchase or normal sale) contracts
that meet the own use requirements of IAS 39 are recognised in
earnings when they are settled by physical delivery. 
Treasury systems and procedures have been reviewed to ensure
that any hedging undertaken by the Group qualifies for hedge
accounting under IFRS where otherwise the impact would be
considered material to the reported Group results.
Deferred tax
Deferred tax will be provided at the date of acquisition and on
some balances previously excluded from provision under UK
rules such as revaluations and fair value adjustments. 
Unrealised gains
The international accounting framework provides no distinction
between unrealised and realised gains for financial reporting. 
As such, all unrealised gains, with the exception of actuarial
gains/losses on post-retirement schemes and currency translation
differences, will be recorded through the income statement and
not through a statement of total recognised gains and losses, as
was required under UK GAAP.
Proportional consolidation of joint venture entities
Results of joint venture entities will be incorporated on an individual
line-by-line basis in the Group financial statements, in accordance
with proportional consolidation rules set out in IAS 31. 
The accounting policies for Joint Arrangements Not Entities (JANEs)
and joint venture operations are fundamentally the same under
both UK and international policies.
Accounting for dividends proposed
The final dividend proposed will only be recognised in the following
year when it is formally approved for payment. This is in accordance
with IAS 10 Events After the Balance Sheet Date and also with 
the Companies Act 1985 (International Accounting Standards and
Other Accounting Amendments) Regulations 2004, which will be
effective for financial years commencing on or after 1 January 2005.
Employee benefit schemes: post-retirement and share
option remuneration
IAS 19 requires companies to recognise the full deficit (or
surplus, subject to restrictions) of post-retirement benefit
schemes under defined benefit arrangements on the balance
sheet. The Group is expected to adopt IAS 19 (revised) early and
will recognise all actuarial gains or losses directly through equity.
Under IFRS, options granted by the Group to employees, for
example under Employee Share Option Schemes and Save As
You Earn Schemes, are to be fair valued at grant date using an
option pricing model and charged through the income statement
over the vesting period of the options. The nature of Anglo’s
employee remuneration schemes is such that there is not
expected to be a material difference to existing UK GAAP
charges on application of IFRS 2.
Translation of results from foreign currency operations
IFRS requires the currency translation adjustment (CTA) arising
on translation of a foreign operation to be recycled through the
income statement when that operation is disposed of. Currently,
under UK GAAP, the CTA is not included in the gain or loss
calculated if that operation is sold.

FINANCIAL REVIEW
CONTINUED
Presentation and disclosure of financial information
The transition to an international accounting framework will give
rise to an increase in certain disclosures to the financial statements.
There will also be some presentational changes. Financial
statements will disclose a detailed reconciliation of reserve
movements for the current year, with comparatives. A statement
of recognised income and expenses will be presented, as required
by IAS 19 (revised), to report actuarial gains/losses in respect of
post-retirement schemes under defined benefit arrangements.
Exploration for and evaluation of mineral resources 
IFRS 6 was issued in December 2004 as an interim standard in
advance of a more comprehensive review of accounting practices
in the extractive industry. The standard does not impact the
Group’s existing policy for exploration and evaluation expenditure.

PRINCIPAL ACTIVITIES AND BUSINESS REVIEW 
Anglo American, with its subsidiaries, joint ventures and
associates, continues to be a global leader in the mining and
natural resource sectors. It has significant and focused interests
in platinum group metals, gold, diamonds, coal, base metals,
industrial minerals, paper and packaging, and ferrous metals and
industries, as well as financial and technical strength.
The Group’s business is a going concern as interpreted by the
Guidance on Going Concern and Financial Reporting for directors
of listed companies registered in the United Kingdom, published
in November 1994. The net book value of the Group’s tangible
fixed assets at 31 December 2004 was $31,155 million.
DIVIDENDS
An interim dividend of 19 US cents per ordinary share was paid on
21 September 2004. The directors recommend a final dividend
of 51 US cents per ordinary share. This will make a total for the
year to 31 December 2004 of 70 US cents per ordinary share.
Subject to the approval of shareholders at the annual general
meeting (AGM) to be held on Wednesday, 20 April 2005, 
the final dividend will be payable on Friday, 29 April 2005 to
shareholders registered in the books of the Company at the close

SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT
The Report to Society 2004 will be available from the Company in
April. This report focuses on the safety, sustainable development,
health and environmental performance of the Company’s managed
operations, their performance with regard to the Company’s Good
Citizenship: Our Business Principles principles and the operational
dimensions of their social programmes.
PA YMENT OF SUPPLIERS
Anglo American plc is a holding company and, as such, has no
trade creditors.
Businesses across the Group are responsible for agreeing the terms
and conditions, including payment terms, under which business
transactions with their suppliers are conducted. These terms
reflect local and industry norms. The Group values its suppliers
and recognises the benefits to be derived from maintaining 
good relationships with them. Anglo American acknowledges 
the importance of paying invoices, especially those of small
businesses, promptly.
POST BALANCE SHEET EVENTS 
On 1 January 2005, Mondi completed the sale of a 42% equity
stake in a new entity which will own Mondi’s South African
packaging businesses. This transaction values the entire
business at $370 million.
The Company announced on 17 February 2005 that it and 
BHP Billiton had reached agreement to dispose of their interest 
in Samancor Chrome for an enterprise value of $469 million. 
The disposal will be effective 1 April 2005, subject to obtaining
regulatory approvals.
VALUE OF LAND
Land is mainly carried in the financial statements at cost. It is
not practicable to estimate the market value of land and mineral
rights, since these depend on product prices over the next 
20 years or longer, which will vary with market conditions.
EMPLOYMENT AND OTHER POLICIES
The Anglo American Group, which operates throughout the world,
is managed along decentralised lines. Each key operating business
is empowered to manage within the context of its own industry,
and the different legislative and social demands of the diverse
countries in which those businesses operate, subject to the
standards embodied in Anglo American’s Good Citizenship: 
Our Business Principles.
Within all Anglo American’s businesses, the safe and effective
performance of all employees, and the maintenance of positive
employee relationships are of fundamental importance. Managers
of Anglo American’s businesses are charged with ensuring that
the following key principles are upheld:
adherence to national legal standards on employment and
workplace rights at all times;
adoption of fair labour practices;
prohibition of child labour;
prohibition of inhumane treatment of employees and any form
of forced labour, physical punishment or other abuse;
continual promotion of safe and healthy working practices;
promotion of workplace equality and elimination of all forms of
unfair discrimination;
provision of opportunities for employees to enhance their work-
related skills and capabilities;
recognition of the right of our employees to freedom of
association; and
adoption of fair and appropriate procedures for determining
terms and conditions of employment.
Copies of the Good Citizenship: Our Business Principles booklet
which sets out standards of conduct on a range of ethical, human
rights and social policy issues are available from the registered
office of the Company and may be accessed on the Company’s
website – www.angloamerican.co.uk
During 2004, numerous employee communication and education
workshops took place. The aim, which included areas as diverse as
Talent Management, Sustainable Development and Group Strategy,
was to provide employees with information on matters of concern
to them, to consult employees regularly for views on matters
affecting them and to make employees aware of financial and
economic factors affecting the performance of the Company.
In addition, presentations by certain operating divisions took place
and a survey of employee communication was conducted. The chief
executive also gave a presentation on the Company’s strategy.
The Company regularly publishes Optima and AngloWorld which
contain items of news, current affairs and information relevant to
Group employees. Press releases and a news clippings service are
published on the Company’s intranet, keeping employees up to
date with developments in those business sectors in which the
Group is active.

DONATIONS
During the year, Anglo American and its subsidiaries made
donations for charitable purposes totalling $47.4 million. Of that
amount, $1.8 million was donated in the UK, consisting of
payments in respect of education, sport and youth $331,000
(18%); community development $942,000 (53%); health and
HIV/AIDS $200,000 (11%); environment $77,000 (4%); arts,
culture and heritage $49,000 (3%) and other charitable causes
$194,000 (11%). A fuller analysis of Anglo American’s social
investment activities can be found in the Annual Review and the
sustainable development Report to Society.
Although it is the policy of Anglo American plc not to give party
political donations, a policy shared by many multinational
corporations, the Anglo American plc board decided in 2003 that
it should make an exception in relation to South Africa’s democratic
transition. The board concluded that its major South African
operating company, Anglo Operations Limited (AOL), could 
set aside the sum of R6 million for donations to political
parties contesting the 2004 South African general election. 
A sub-committee of the board headed by Sir Mark Moody-Stuart
considered an appropriate allocation of funds and recommended
that the African National Congress, as the ruling party enjoying
the majority electoral support in the country, should receive 
R3 million of the donation; the Democratic Alliance, as the official
opposition and second largest party, R1.5 million; the next three
largest parties – the Inkatha Freedom Party, the New National Party
and the United Democratic Movement – R480,000, R240,000 and
R120,000 respectively; and R60,000 each to the other smaller
parties with representation in the South African parliament. 
These donations were made in February 2004. The Anglo American
Platinum board decided to contribute R1 million of the total of
R6 million donated by AOL.
In December 2003, the board of AngloGold decided to authorise
total donations for the South African political parties, to be paid
in 2004, of R1.6 million according to the formula – 30% each 
to the African National Congress and Democratic Alliance 
and 20% each to the Inkatha Freedom Party and the United
Democratic Movement.
In February 2004, a sub-committee of the board of Kumba
Resources authorised payments of R1 million in support of the
democratic process in South Africa. The money was distributed
to each of the six parties with representation in parliament with
a small upweighting of the share going to opposition parties.
This resulted in the following division: African National Congress
R600,000, Democratic Alliance R200,000, Inkatha Freedom
Party R120,000, the New National Party R50,000 and the
United Democratic Movement R30,000.
In February 2004, the board of Tongaat-Hulett also decided to make
a donation of R500,000 in support of the democratic process in
South Africa. The total grant was divided between the six parties
represented in parliament in proportion to the number of seats
which they hold. 
The Anglo American plc board has reaffirmed the policy of not
making donations to, or incurring expenses for the benefit of, any
UK political party or any other EU political organisation, as defined
in the Political Parties, Elections and Referendums Act 2000.
AUDITORS
Resolutions to reappoint the auditors, Deloitte & Touche LLP, and
to authorise the board to determine their remuneration, will be
proposed at the forthcoming annual general meeting in accordance
with Section 384 of the Companies Act 1985.
ANNUAL GENERAL MEETING
The AGM will be held at 11:00 am on Wednesday, 20 April 2005
at The Conference Centre, Church House, Dean’s Yard, London
SW1P 3NZ. The notice convening the meeting is set out in the
separate booklet enclosed with this report. In addition to the
ordinary business of the meeting (which includes a resolution to
approve the directors’ remuneration report), as special business,
shareholder consent will be sought to renew the directors’ existing
authorities to:
(i) allot relevant securities up to an aggregate nominal amount of
$248,500,000 (equivalent to 497 million ordinary shares 
of $0.50 each). This authority, which the directors have no
present intention of exercising (other than as referred to in
(ii) below) represents 33.3% of the ordinary issued share
capital at 22 February 2005 and is in accordance with the
Association of British Insurers (ABI) guidelines; 
(ii) allot equity securities for cash up to an aggregate nominal
amount of $37,250,000 (equivalent to 74.5 million ordinary
shares of $0.50 each), being 5% of the ordinary issued share
capital in issue at 22 February 2005, which limit complies with
the guidelines of the Pre-Emption Group (set up by the London
Stock Exchange and which includes the National Association
of Pension Fund Managers and the ABI). The directors have no
present intention of exercising this authority except in relation
to the allotment of ordinary shares to certain non-executive
directors by subscription of their after tax directors’ fees; and
(iii) make market purchases of up to a maximum of 149 million
ordinary shares of $0.50 each of the Company, being up to
10% of the ordinary issued share capital at 22 February 2005,
at a price not less than $0.50 and not exceeding 105% of
the average middle market closing price of such shares on the
London Stock Exchange on the five dealing days prior to the
date of repurchase. The directors have no present intention 
of exercising this authority and would only do so if they
considered it was in the best interests of shareholders generally
and if the purchase could be expected to result in an increase
in earnings per share. In exercising this authority, the directors
may treat the shares that have been bought back as either
cancelled or held in treasury (or a combination of both), 
and to the extent that any such shares are held in treasury,
earnings per share will only be increased until such time as
the shares are transferred or re-sold out of treasury. Treating
the bought-back shares as treasury shares gives the Company
the ability to sell or transfer them quickly and cost-effectively
and provides the Company with additional flexibility in the
management of its capital base. The Company may use any
shares repurchased and held in treasury for the purposes of
its employee share schemes. If any such shares are used, the
Company will, so long as required under institutional investor
guidelines, count them towards the limits in the schemes as
if they were newly issued shares. The total number of options
to subscribe for shares outstanding at 22 February 2005,
which could be issued on conversion of the 3.375%
convertible bonds due April 2007, was 47,589,607 ordinary
shares, which represents 3.2% of the issued ordinary share
capital at that date. If the Company were to buy back the
maximum number of shares permitted pursuant to this
resolution, then the total number of options to subscribe for
shares outstanding would represent 3.5% of the reduced
issued share capital.

CORPORATE GOVERNANCE
COMPLIANCE STATEMENT
The Anglo American Group is committed to the highest standards
of business integrity, ethical values and professionalism in all 
its activities. As an essential part of this commitment, the board
supports the highest standards of corporate governance and the
directors are accountable to the shareholders for doing so. The
key principles underpinning the governance of the Group are set
out in this statement. 
An effective system of control aimed at managing business risks
is an integral component of the Group’s governance practices,
details of which are provided in the internal control section below.
Throughout the year ended 31 December 2004 and up to the date
of this report, the Company has been in compliance with the
provisions set out in Section 1 of the Combined Code on Corporate
Governance issued by the Financial Reporting Council. Details of
the application of the principles of Section 1 of the Combined Code
are set out below.
BOARD OF DIRECTORS
The board of directors is responsible to the shareholders for setting
the direction of Anglo American through the establishment of
strategic objectives and key policies. The board meets on a regular
basis, at least six times a year. The board considers issues of
strategic direction, major acquisitions and disposals and approves
major capital expenditure and other matters having a material
effect on Anglo American. Presentations are made to the board
by business management on the activities of operations and both
executive and non-executive directors undertake regular visits 
to operations and projects. During 2004, non-executive directors
visited the following operations: Richards Bay and SilvaCel paper
mills, the Sishen iron ore mine and the Potgietersrust Platinums
mine in South Africa and the Hippo Valley, Unki and Zimbabwe
Alloys operations in Zimbabwe, as well as operations in Canada
and China.
The composition of the board, with a strong independent
element, ensures that no one individual has unfettered powers
of decision and authority. Following the retirement of W A Nairn
on 31 December 2004, the board currently comprises three
executive and eleven non-executive directors, eight of whom are
independent according to the definition contained in the Combined
Code. The independent directors are Sir Mark Moody-Stuart, 
D J Challen, F T M Phaswana, Prof K A L M Van Miert, Dr C E Fay,
G Lindahl, R J Margetts and Dr M S B Marques. R J Margetts is
the senior independent non-executive director.
The other non-executive directors are R M Godsell, N F Oppenheimer
and Sir David Scholey. The terms and conditions of appointment
of non-executive directors are available for inspection upon
request during normal business hours and at the AGM and 
are referred to in the Remuneration Report set out on page 34.
Sir David Scholey and Mr Göran Lindahl have indicated that they
will retire from the board at the AGM in April. The board has
recommended to shareholders the appointment of Mr R C Alexander
as a non-executive director with effect from 20 April 2005. 
The board has also recommended to shareholders that Mr R Médori
be appointed a director with effect from 1 June 2005 with the
intention that he will take over the position of finance director
on 1 September 2005. The board has also recommended 
to shareholders the appointment of Mr D A Hathorn and
Mr S R Thompson as executive directors of the Company.
Biographical details of Messrs Hathorn and Thompson are set 
out on page 14 of the Annual Review. Biographical details of 
Messrs Alexander and Médori are set out in the Notice of Meeting.
The chairman is responsible for leading the board and for its
effectiveness. He sets the agenda for meetings of the board 
in collaboration with the chief executive. The chairman, with 
the assistance of the company secretary, ensures that the
directors receive timely, accurate and clear information before
board meetings and updates of issues arising between meetings. 
The chief executive, together with the other members of the
Executive Board, is responsible for the overall day-to-day
management of the Company.
In the year to 31 December 2004 the board met seven times,
the Audit and Nomination Committees four times and the
Remuneration Committee five times. The attendance at these
meetings was as follows:

Anglo American’s directors have a wide range of expertise as
well as significant experience in financial, commercial and mining
activities. As recommended by the Combined Code, all directors
have full access to internal and external auditors, and are
encouraged to stay fully abreast of the Group’s business through
meetings with senior management and site visits. Training 
and briefings are available to all directors on appointment and
subsequently, as necessary, taking into account existing
qualifications and experience. During the year, directors have
attended, inter alia, workshops and briefings on the following
subjects: the new OFR (operating and financial review)
requirements; board effectiveness; remuneration committees;
the role of the chairman, and corporate social responsibility.
Four of the non-executive directors, Dr Fay and Messrs Godsell,
Margetts and Oppenheimer, will have completed six years as
directors of the Company during the course of 2005. The Combined
Code requires that where non-executive directors remain on 
a board beyond a six-year term, their continuance should be
subject to rigorous review and should take into account the need
for progressive refreshing of the board.
7878v03_PH_Rp_FC-p27_020305.qxp  3/3/05  7:29 pm  Page 22 Anglo American plc Annual Report 2004 23
In October 2004, the board met for its annual three day strategy
session, part of which was devoted to an evaluation of the
performance of the board, its committees and its members. 
The directors (other than Dr Fay and Messrs Godsell, Margetts and
Oppenheimer) confirm that, having reviewed their performance,
they believe that it is in the best interests of the Company for 
Dr Fay and Messrs Godsell, Margetts and Oppenheimer to
continue as directors of the Company beyond their six year terms.
In reaching this conclusion, the board has taken cognisance of
the unique positions of Messrs Godsell and Oppenheimer as,
respectively, the CEO and chairman of AngloGold Ashanti and
De Beers. Their advice and input to the Anglo American plc board
in relation to their respective companies are considered essential.
Dr Fay and Mr Margetts chair the Safety & Sustainable Development
and Remuneration Committees, respectively, and also provide
invaluable input as members of the Audit Committee. Dr Fay has
many years’ experience in the safety, health and environment
field, as well as broad technical and project management experience
and has gained considerable insight into these aspects of the
various Group operations. His continued leadership of the drive
to improve safety and enhance sustainable development at the
Company’s operations is considered most desirable and in the
best interests of the Company and its workforce as well as 
its shareholders. Mr Margetts has broad experience of global
businesses and, in addition to his contribution to strategic issues,
has shown great skill in the complex field of remuneration policy
and in his roles as chairman of the Remuneration Committee, 
a member of the Nomination and Audit Committees and as the
senior independent non-executive director. The board is therefore
of the view that it is also in the interest of the Company for Mr
Margetts to continue in those roles beyond the six-year term.
In addition, the board performance evaluation process confirmed
that those directors due for re-election at the AGM (Messrs Godsell
and Trahar and Professor Van Miert) continue to demonstrate their
commitment and to make valuable and effective contributions 
to the Company and the proposed re-elections are therefore
recommended by the chairman and the board.
In relation to the “progressive refreshing of the board”, 
Dr Marques’ appointment in December 2003, brought new insight
into South American affairs and the intended appointment of
Messrs Hathorn, Médori and Thompson as executive directors and
the intended appointment of Mr Alexander as an independent
non-executive director will bring further invaluable and new
experience to the board. 
The board is confident that it has, therefore, fully complied 
with the requirements of the Combined Code in regard to the
constitution of the board.
As referred to above, a formal evaluation of the performance of
the board, its committees and the directors was carried out in
October 2004 by means of detailed questionnaires and interviews.
This process confirmed that all the directors’ contributions remain
valid. The results of the evaluation were discussed at the October
meeting of the board. The evaluation process also included 
a review, chaired by the senior independent non-executive
director (without the chairman present), of the performance of
the chairman. The board evaluation process resulted in a number
of changes to board agenda items and the conduct of the board
meetings. In addition, a programme of informal meetings of
directors was instituted.
All directors have access to management, and to the advice and
services of the company secretary, and to such information as 
is needed to carry out their duties and responsibilities fully 
and effectively. Furthermore, all directors are entitled to seek
independent professional advice concerning the affairs of Anglo
American at its expense. All directors are subject to election by
shareholders at the first opportunity following their appointment.
In addition, directors retire by rotation and stand for re-election
by shareholders at least once every three years in accordance
with Anglo American’s articles of association.
Subject to specific fundamental, strategic and formal matters
reserved for its decision, the board delegates certain responsibilities
to a number of standing committees, which operate within defined
terms of reference laid down by the board, as referred to below.
The terms of reference of the Audit, Remuneration, Nomination
and Safety & Sustainable Development Committees of the board
are published on the Company’s website.

regularly reviews and updates the succession plans of directors
and senior managers.
During the year the Nomination Committee managed the process
of the selection of René Médori to succeed Tony Lea as finance
director with effect from 1 September 2005 and the proposed

The Nomination Committee presently comprises: F T M Phaswana
(chairman), R J Margetts, Sir Mark Moody-Stuart, N F Oppenheimer,
Sir David Scholey and Prof K A L M Van Miert. 
AUDIT COMMITTEE 
Role and responsibilities
The primary role of the Audit Committee is to ensure the integrity
of financial reporting and the audit process, and that a sound risk
management and internal control system is maintained. In pursuing
these objectives the Audit Committee oversees relations with
the external auditors and reviews the effectiveness of the internal
audit function.
In fulfilling its responsibility of monitoring the integrity of financial
reports to shareholders, the Audit Committee has reviewed
accounting principles, policies and practices adopted in the
preparation of public financial information and has examined
documentation relating to the Annual Report, Annual Review,
Interim Report, preliminary announcements and related public
reports. The clarity of disclosures included in the financial
statements was reviewed by the Audit Committee, as was the
basis for significant estimates and judgements. In assessing the
accounting treatment of major transactions open to different
approaches, the Committee considered written reports by
management and the external auditors. The Committee’s
recommendations are submitted to the board for approval.
The chief financial officers of all operations have provided
confirmation, on a six-monthly basis, that financial and accounting
control frameworks operate satisfactorily. The Audit Committee
considered summaries of the significant risk and control issues
arising from these reports. The Audit Committee also received
regular internal and external audit reports on the results of audits
at various operations. Further information on risk management
processes is provided in the internal control disclosure statement
on page 26.
The Audit Committee has satisfied itself that the United Kingdom
professional and regulatory requirements for audit partner rotation
and employment of former employees of the external auditors
have been complied with.
The Audit Committee considered information pertaining to the
balance between fees for audit and non-audit work for the Group
in 2004 and concluded that the nature and extent of non-audit
fees do not present a threat to the external auditors’ independence.
Furthermore, after reviewing a report from the external auditors
on all relationships between the external auditors and Anglo
American that might reasonably have a bearing on the external
auditors’ independence and the audit engagement partner and
staff’s objectivity, and the related safeguards and procedures,
the Audit Committee has concluded that the external auditors’
independence was not impaired.
The Audit Committee approved the external auditors’ terms of
engagement, scope of work, the process for the 2004 interim
review, the annual audit and the applicable levels of materiality.
Based on written reports submitted, the Audit Committee reviewed,
with the external auditors, the findings of their work and confirmed
that all significant matters have been satisfactorily resolved. 
The Committee’s assessment of the external auditors’ performance
and independence underpins its recommendation to the board to
propose to shareholders the re-appointment of Deloitte & Touche
LLP as auditors until the conclusion of the AGM in 2006.
7878v03_PH_Rp_FC-p27_020305.qxp  2/3/05  11:52 pm  Page 24 Anglo American plc Annual Report 2004 25
Each internal audit function reports directly to an audit committee
at business or listed company level and is accountable for
maintaining Group auditing standards, including risk reporting.
Internal audit functions’ mandates and annual audit coverage plans
were approved by the relevant audit committees, which have
considered reports on the results of internal audit work. A summary
of audit results and risk management information was presented
to the Audit Committee at regular intervals throughout the year.
Also tabled were reports submitted by the Group’s head of
internal audit on internal audit functions’ performance against
Group standards. The effectiveness of the Group’s internal audit
functions is evaluated by means of annual assessments against
predetermined criteria and periodic external peer reviews, the
results of which are reported to the Audit Committee.
During the year the Audit Committee has reviewed the Group’s
progress towards the implementation of the new International
Financial Reporting Standard (IFRS)programme. A special meeting
was called in April 2004 to consider the accounting options for
first time adoption of IFRS.
The Audit Committee also reviewed business units’ audit coverage
plans aimed at providing assurance in respect of mineral resources
and ore reserves.
Composition of the Audit Committee 
The Committee comprises solely independent non-executive
directors. The dates of appointment and names of those who were
members during the year and who currently remain members are:
D J Challen (chairman) 9 September 2002
R J Margetts 19 March 1999
Dr C E Fay 4 June 2001
F T M Phaswana 2 September 2002
Prof K A L M Van Miert 10 May 2002
The board, in consultation with the Audit Committee chairman,
makes appointments to the Audit Committee. The board has
determined that the Committee members have the skills and
experience necessary to contribute meaningfully to the Committees’
deliberations. In addition, the chairman of the Committee has
requisite experience in accounting and financial management.
The Audit Committee met four times during 2004, two meetings
coinciding with key dates within the financial reporting and auditing
cycle. All of the members were present at those meetings, two of
which were followed by discussions, independent of management,
with the external audit partners and the head of internal audit.
Details of remuneration paid to members of the Audit Committee,
including the additional fee paid to the chairman of the Audit
Committee, are set out on page 36.
Policy on external auditors’ independence
Anglo American’s policy on auditors’ independence, which 
came into effect on 1 January 2003, is consistent with the
ethical standards promulgated by the Auditing Practices Board
and published in December 2004.
A key factor that may impair auditors’ independence is a lack of
control over non-audit services provided by the external auditors.
In essence, the external auditors’ independence is deemed to be
impaired if the auditors provide a service which:
results in auditing of own work by the auditors;
results in the auditors acting as a manager or employee 
of the Group;
puts the auditors in the role of advocate for the Group; or
creates a mutuality of interest between the auditors and 
the Group.
Anglo American addresses this issue through three primary
measures, namely disclosure of the extent and nature of non-
audit services, the prohibition of selected services, and prior
approval by the Audit Committee chairman of non-audit services
where the cost of the proposed assignment is likely to exceed a
specified amount. Disclosure entails reporting non-audit services
to the Group’s audit committees and inclusion of prescribed detail
in the Annual Reports of listed entities. The policy’s definition 
of prohibited non-audit services corresponds with the European
Commission’s recommendations on auditors’ independence.
Other safeguards encapsulated in the policy include:
The external auditors are required to adhere to a rotation policy
based on best practice and professional standards in the 
United Kingdom. The standard period for rotation of the audit
engagement partner is five years and for any key audit principal
seven years.
Any partner designated as a key audit principal of Anglo American
will not be employed by Anglo American in a key management
position unless a period of at least two years has elapsed since
the conclusion of the last relevant audit.
The Audit Committee ensures that the scope of the auditors’ work
is sufficient and that the auditors are fairly remunerated.
The Audit Committee has primary responsibility for making
recommendations to the board on the appointment,
reappointment and removal of the external auditors.
The Audit Committee has the authority to engage independent
counsel and other advisors as they determine necessary in order
to resolve issues on auditor independence.
DIRECTORS’ REMUNERATION
The directors’ remuneration report, setting out Anglo American’s
policy on executive directors’ remuneration, benefits, share
schemes, long term incentive and bonus plans and pension
entitlements, is set out on pages 28 to 43 of this Annual Report.
A resolution to approve the remuneration report will be proposed
at the forthcoming AGM.

CORPORATE GOVERNANCE
CONTINUED
RELATIONS WITH SHAREHOLDERS
The Company maintains an active dialogue with its key financial
audiences, including institutional shareholders and sell-side
analysts. The Investor and Corporate Affairs department
manages the ongoing dialogue with these audiences and regular
presentations take place at the time of interim and final results
as well as during the rest of the year. An active programme with
potential shareholders is also maintained.
Any concerns raised by a shareholder in relation to the Company
and its affairs are communicated to the board as a whole. 
The board is briefed on a regular basis by the Investor and
Corporate Affairs department and analysts’ reports are circulated
to the directors.
During the year there have been regular presentations and
meetings with institutional investors in the UK, South Africa,
continental Europe, the USA and Canada to communicate the
strategy and performance of Anglo American. Executive directors
as well as key corporate officers host such presentations and
meetings. The chairman is also available to shareholders to
discuss any matter they wish to raise. The Company’s website
(www.angloamerican.co.uk) provides the latest and historical
financial and other information on Anglo American.
Shareholders will have the opportunity at the forthcoming AGM,
notice of which is contained in the booklet enclosed herewith, 
to put questions to the board, including the chairmen of the
various committees. Facilities have been put in place to enable
shareholders to receive company communications electronically
rather than by mail and, for those unable to attend the meeting,
to cast their AGM votes by telephone or by electronic means
including those shareholders whose shares are held in the 
CREST system.
Voting on each resolution to be proposed at the AGM will 
be conducted on a poll rather than by a show of hands. 
The results of the poll will be announced to the press and 
on the Company’s website.
ACCOUNTABILITY AND AUDIT
The board is required to present a balanced and understandable
assessment of Anglo American’s financial position and
prospects. Such assessment is provided in the chairman’s
questions and answers and the chief executive’s statement set
out on pages 2 to 5 and the financial review set out on pages 
6 to 18 of this Annual Report. The respective responsibilities 
of the directors and external auditors are set out on pages 
44 and 45. As referred to in the directors’ report on page 19,
the directors have expressed their view that Anglo American’s
business is a going concern.
INTERNAL CONTROL DISCLOSURE 
The Executive Board, as mandated by the board, has established
a Group-wide system of internal control to manage significant
Group risks. This system, which has been operating throughout
the year and to the date of this report, supports the board in
discharging its responsibility for ensuring that the wide range of
risks associated with the Group’s diverse international operations
is effectively managed in support of the creation and preservation
of shareholder wealth. The board’s policy on risk management
encompasses all significant business risks to the Group, including
financial, operational and compliance risk, which could undermine
the achievement of business objectives. This system of risk
management is designed so that the different businesses are able
to tailor and adapt their risk management processes to suit their
specific circumstances. This flexible approach has the commitment
of the Group’s senior management. There is clear accountability
for risk management, which is a key performance area of line
managers throughout the Group. The requisite risk and control
capability is assured through board challenge and appropriate
management selection and skills development. Managers are
supported in giving effect to their risk responsibilities through
policies and guidelines on risk and control management. Continuous
monitoring of risk and control processes, across 15 significant
Group-wide risk areas and other business-specific risk areas,
provides the basis for regular and exception reporting to business
management and boards, the Executive Board and the board. 
The risk assessment and reporting criteria are designed to provide
the board with a consistent, Group-wide perspective of the key
risks. The reports to the board, which are submitted at least every
six months, include an assessment of the likelihood and impact
of risks materialising, as well as risk mitigation initiatives and
their effectiveness. 
The system of internal control, which is embedded in all key
operations, provides reasonable rather than absolute assurance
that the Group’s business objectives will be achieved within the
risk tolerance levels defined by the board. Regular management
reporting, which provides a balanced assessment of key risks
and controls, is an important component of board assurance. 
In addition, certain board committees focus on specific risks such
as safety of people and capital investment and provide assurance
to the board on those matters. The chief financial officers provide
confirmation, on a six-monthly basis, that financial and accounting
control frameworks have operated satisfactorily. The board also
receives assurance from the Audit Committee, which derives its
information, in part, from regular internal and external audit reports
on risk and internal control throughout the Group. The Group’s
internal audit functions have a formal collaboration process in
place with the external auditors to ensure efficient coverage of
internal controls. The Anglo American internal audit function is
responsible for providing independent assurance to the Executive
Board and the board on the effectiveness of the risk management
process throughout the Group.
Anglo American seeks to have a sound system of internal control,
based on the Group’s policies and guidelines, in all material
associates and joint ventures. In those companies that are
independently managed, the directors who are represented on
these organisations’ boards seek assurance that significant risks
are being managed. 
7878v03_PH_Rp_FC-p27_020305.qxp  4/3/05  10:16 am  Page 26 Anglo American plc Annual Report 2004 27
In conducting its annual review of the effectiveness of risk
management, the board considers the key findings from the
ongoing monitoring and reporting processes, management
assertions and independent assurance reports. The board 
also takes account of material changes and trends in the risk
profile and considers whether the control system, including
reporting, adequately supports the board in achieving its 
risk management objectives. 
During the course of the year the board considered the Group’s
responsiveness to changes within its business environment. 
The board is satisfied that there is an ongoing process, which has
been operational during the year, and up to the date of approval
of the Annual Report, for identifying, evaluating and managing
the significant risks faced by the Group in accordance with the
Turnbull guidelines. This includes social, environmental and ethical
risks as highlighted in the Disclosure Guidelines on Socially
Responsible Investment issued by the Association of British
Insurers. A detailed report on social, environmental and ethical
issues will be included in the Company’s Report to Society 2004.
WHISTLEBLOWING PROGRAMME
Following adoption in December 2003 of a whistleblowing policy
that is aligned with the Public Interest Disclosure Act 1998, the
Group has implemented a whistleblowing programme in virtually
all of the managed operations. The programme, which is monitored
by the Audit Committee, is aimed at enabling employees,
customers, suppliers, managers or other stakeholders, on a
confidential basis, to raise concerns in cases where conduct is
deemed to be contrary to our values. It may include:
actions that may result in danger to the health and/or safety of
people or damage to the environment;
unethical practice in accounting, internal accounting controls,
financial reporting and auditing matters;
criminal offences, including money laundering, fraud, bribery
and corruption;
failure to comply with any legal obligation;
miscarriage of justice;
any conduct contrary to the ethical principles embraced in our
Good Citizenship: Our Business Principles or any similar policy; 
any other legal or ethical concern; and
concealment of any of the above.
The programme makes available a selection of telephonic, 
e-mail, web-based and surface mail communication channels to
any person in the world who has information about unethical
practice in Anglo American plc and its managed operations. 
The communication facilities are operated by independent service
providers who sanitise information received from callers to remove
all indications as to the identity of the callers before submission
to designated persons in the Group.

REMUNERATION REPORT
REMUNERATION COMMITTEE
Role of the Remuneration Committee and Terms of Reference
The Remuneration Committee (the Committee) is responsible for considering and making recommendations to the board on:
the Company’s general policy on executive and senior management remuneration;
the specific remuneration packages for executive directors of the Company, including basic salary, performance-based short 
and long term incentives, pensions, and other benefits; and
the design and operation of the Company’s share incentive schemes.
The full Terms of Reference of the Committee can be found on the Anglo American website and copies are available on request. 
The Committee met five times during 2004.
Membership of the Committee 
The Committee comprised the following independent non-executive directors during the year ended 31 December 2004: 
R J Margetts (chairman);
D J Challen;
Dr C E Fay; and
F T M Phaswana.
The Company’s chairman and chief executive attend the Committee meetings by invitation and assist the Committee in its
considerations, except when issues relating to their own compensation are discussed. No directors are involved in deciding their 
own remuneration. In 2004 the Committee was advised by R J King and C B Corrin (Group Human Resources), the Company’s
finance function and by Ernst & Young LLP (who were appointed by the Committee to act as independent advisors).
In 2004, the Committee also received advice from:
Monks Partnership (a subsidiary of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP) – appointed by the Company, with the agreement 
of the Committee, to provide market remuneration data; 
PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP – appointed by the Company, with the agreement of the Committee, to provide specialist 
valuation services; and
Hewitt Bacon & Woodrow Limited – appointed by the Company, with the agreement of the Committee, to provide specialist 
actuarial advice.
In addition, Mercer Human Resource Consulting Limited (Mercer) is engaged by the Committee to review the Committee’s processes
on an annual basis in order to provide shareholders with assurance that the remuneration processes that the Company and the
Committee have followed are in line with the stated policy as set out below, and that the Committee has operated within its Terms
of Reference. A summary of the letter from Mercer containing the conclusions of their review of the Committee’s executive
remuneration processes for 2004 can be found on page 43, whilst the full letter can be found on the Company’s website.

Anglo American’s remuneration policy is formulated to attract and retain high calibre executives and motivate them to develop and
implement the Company’s business strategy in order to optimise long term shareholder value creation. It is the intention that this
policy should conform to best practice standards and that it will apply for 2005 and subsequent years, subject to ongoing review 
as appropriate. The policy is framed around the following key principles:
total rewards will be set at levels that are sufficiently competitive to enable the recruitment and retention of high calibre executives;
total incentive-based rewards will be earned through the achievement of demanding performance conditions consistent with 
shareholder interests;
incentive plans, performance measures and targets will be structured to operate soundly throughout the business cycle; 
the design of long term incentives will be prudent and will not expose shareholders to unreasonable financial risk;
in considering the market positioning of reward elements, account will be taken of the performance of the Company 
and of the individual executive director; and
reward practice will conform to best practice standards as far as reasonably practicable. 
Representatives of the Company’s principal investors are consulted on changes to remuneration policy.
Elements of executive director remuneration
Each executive director’s total remuneration consists of salary, annual bonus, long term incentives and benefits. An appropriate
balance is maintained between fixed and performance-related remuneration and between elements linked to short term financial
performance and those linked to longer term shareholder value creation. 
Assuming on-target performance, the Committee’s policy is that at least 50% (60% for the chief executive) or more of total
executive director remuneration is performance-related. In 2004, 67% of the chief executive’s remuneration on an expected value
basis was performance-related; for the other executive directors, on average the figure was 61% (see illustrative charts below). 
Shareholders approved the introduction of the new Bonus Share Plan (BSP) at the AGM in 2004. Taken together, the BSP and the
existing Long Term Incentive Plan (LTIP) are designed to clearly underpin the Company’s existing performance culture by creating 
a better linkage between shareholder value creation and executive reward. The combination of performance measures provides a
thorough assessment of value-driven performance. The Committee monitors closely the relevance and appropriateness of the
performance measures and targets applicable to the BSP and LTIP. These performance conditions may be amended by the Committee
only to the extent that they are a fairer measure of performance, consistent with the original performance conditions and no less
demanding. The level of share-based remuneration within the reward mix will ensure that executive directors and other levels of
management have a meaningful level of exposure to the Company’s share price performance.

Basic salary
The basic salary of the executive directors is reviewed annually and is targeted at the median of companies of comparable size,
market sector, business complexity and international scope. Company performance, individual performance and changes in
responsibilities are also taken into consideration in setting salary levels each year.
Bonus Share Plan
The BSP was operated for the first time during 2004 and all executive directors are eligible to participate in it. 
The BSP requires executive directors to invest a significant proportion of their remuneration in shares, thereby more closely aligning
their interests with those of shareholders, and encourages management at all levels to build up a meaningful personal stake in the
Company. Awards under the BSP are made annually and consist of three elements: a performance-related cash element, an equal
amount, as a conditional award, of Bonus Shares and an additional performance-related element in the form of Enhancement Shares.
These bonus awards are not pensionable. The BSP operates as follows:
the value of the bonus is calculated by reference to achievement against annual performance targets. The performance measures
for the BSP include measures of corporate and, where applicable, business unit performance as well as the achievement of
specific individual objectives. For executive directors, the corporate element is based on stretching Earnings Per Share (EPS)
targets which are calculated using headline earnings (defined in note 12 of the financial statements). In 2004, the EPS targets
were met in full; 
the Committee reviews these measures annually to ensure they remain appropriate and sufficiently stretching in the context 
of the economic and performance expectations for the Company and its operating businesses; 
it is the Committee’s usual policy to base 70% of each annual bonus award on the corporate or business measure and the
remaining 30% on key personal performance measures. The level of bonuses payable will be reduced if certain overall safety
improvement targets are not met. Bonus parameters are set on an individual basis;
in the case of the directors and top tier of management, half of the bonus is paid in cash. The cash element would not normally
exceed 75% of basic salary for the chief executive and 60% of basic salary for the other executive directors. The other half of
the bonus is in the form of a conditional award of Bonus Shares equal in value to the cash element. These Bonus Shares vest 
only if the participant remains in employment with the Group until the end of a three year holding period, or is, in the view of the
Remuneration Committee, deemed to be a ‘good leaver’; and
in order to provide continuing focus on medium term performance, executive directors will also receive an award of conditional
Enhancement Shares at the same time as the award of Bonus Shares. The maximum potential, at face value, of the
Enhancement Shares is 75% of the face value of the Bonus Shares (i.e. in the case of the chief executive a maximum of 56% 
of basic salary). Awards of Enhancement Shares made in 2004 will vest after three years only to the extent that a challenging
performance condition, based on EPS growth against the UK Retail Price Index (RPI), is met, as shown below:
Real EPS has been selected as the most appropriate performance measure for this element of the plan because it is a fundamental
financial performance indicator, both internally and externally, and links directly to Anglo American’s long term objectives of
maintaining and improving earnings. The targets were approved by the Committee after reviewing industry performance over a
number of years and have been set at a level which provides stretching performance levels for management. At the end of each
performance period, the level of performance achieved and the proportion of awards vesting will be published in the subsequent
remuneration report. 
In 2004, only executive directors and the top tier of management worldwide (circa 50 individuals) participated in the BSP. In 2005,
it is intended that participation in the BSP will be extended to other tiers of senior management globally (circa 1,300 individuals)
who will thereafter cease to receive grants under the Company’s Executive Share Option Scheme (ESOS).

Share option and all employee schemes
No share options were granted to executive directors under the ESOS in 2004 and, as noted above, future grants under the ESOS
will be discontinued, other than for use in recruitment or other exceptional circumstances.
Executive directors remain eligible to participate in the Company’s Save As You Earn (SA YE) and Share Incentive Plan (SIP) schemes.
As these schemes are open to all UK employees, performance conditions do not apply.
Long Term Incentive Plan
Grant levels
Conditional LTIP awards continue to be made annually to executive directors. Awards under the LTIP in 2004 were increased from
120% to 160% of basic salary for the chief executive and from 100% to 130% of basic salary for the other executive directors.
Awards were raised in order to maintain market competitiveness and to reflect the rebalanced incentive structure. These awards are
discretionary and are considered on a case-by-case basis. In exceptional circumstances and in order to accommodate changing market
conditions, individual awards may be made up to a maximum of two times’ basic salary per annum.
Performance measures
As in previous years, vesting of LTIP awards made during 2004 is subject to the achievement of stretching performance targets,
relating to Total Shareholder Return (TSR) and to an operating measure, currently Return On Capital Employed (ROCE), over a fixed
three year period. In previous years, executive directors with direct divisional responsibility were measured partially on divisional
ROCE as well as Group ROCE. However, all awards made in 2004 and thereafter will be measured only on Group ROCE, in order to
provide a simpler and more coherent focus on overall Group performance. Half of each award made to a director, therefore, is subject
to a Group TSR measure while the other half of each award is subject to a Group ROCE measure. These performance measures were
selected on the basis that they clearly foster the creation of shareholder value. At the end of each performance period, the level of
ROCE performance achieved and the level of award earned will be published in the subsequent remuneration report. There is no
retesting of performance.
The LTIP closely aligns the interests of shareholders and executive directors by rewarding superior shareholder and financial
performance and by encouraging executives to build up a shareholding in the Company.
Total Shareholder Return
The Committee considers comparative TSR to be a suitable long term performance measure for the Company’s LTIP awards.
Executives benefit only if shareholders have enjoyed returns on their investment which are superior to those that could have been
obtained in other comparable companies. 
The vesting of that part of the LTIP award contingent upon TSR performance varies according to the Company’s TSR over the
performance period, relative to a weighted basket of international natural resource companies (the Index). The Index comprises 
three categories: the first consists of a minimum of five international diversified mining companies, the second a minimum of five
international paper and packaging companies and the third a minimum of four international industrial minerals companies. Each
category is weighted to reflect Anglo American’s business mix. The Committee may amend the list of comparator companies in 
the Index, and the relative weightings, if circumstances make this necessary (for example, as a result of takeovers or mergers 
of comparator companies in the Index). In calculating TSR, it is assumed that all dividends are reinvested.
For awards made in 2004, the companies constituting the Index were as follows:
Mining Paper and Packaging Industrial Minerals
Category weighting 71% 17% 12%
Comparator companies BHP Billiton plc M-real Corporation Aggregate Industries plc
Companhia Vale do Rio Doce Sappi Limited CRH plc

Shares contingent on TSR performance will vest as follows:

Equal to the weighted average TSR of the Index 50
Equal to the weighted average TSR of the top two companies in each category 100
Equal to or greater than the weighted average TSR of the top company in each category 150
Shares will vest on a straight-line basis for performance between 50% and 100% and between 100% and 150% as described above.
A graph showing the Company’s TSR performance against the weighted average of the Index as shown above for the five years from
1 January 2000 to 31 December 2004 can be found on page 35; for the purposes of drawing this graph, Companhia Vale do Rio
Doce and Xstrata plc were excluded as they were not listed at the beginning of the period depicted by the graph.
Return On Capital Employed
Group ROCE is the second performance measure for LTIP grants. The board considers this to be among the most important factors
which drive sustainable improvements in shareholder value in a natural resources business, as well as one of the most important
measures of differentiation in performance in this sector.
The proportion of shares vesting based on Group ROCE will vary according to the degree of improvement in the Group’s average
annualised ROCE over the performance period.
The Committee sets minimum targets for improvement in returns on both capital employed for the financial year preceding the start of
the performance period (existing capital employed) and on the additional capital employed during the performance period (incremental
capital employed). The maximum ROCE targets are based on stretching levels of return on the existing capital employed. 
The targets for each element of the LTIP conditionally awarded in 2004 are shown below. These are adjusted for movements in
commodity prices, certain foreign exchange rate effects, capital in progress and for relevant changes in the composition of the Group.

Shares will vest on a straight-line basis for performance between the minimum target and the maximum target.
Vesting of share incentives in the event of change of control or termination of employment
In the event of a change of control of the Company, the following provisions apply under the Company’s incentive plans:
share options granted under the former ESOS may be exercised irrespective of whether the applicable performance conditions
have been met; 
the number of shares that vest under the LTIP will be calculated by reference to the extent to which the applicable performance
conditions have been met at the time of the change of control;
participants will be entitled to receive their bonus and matching shares under the former Deferred Bonus Plan;
Bonus Shares awarded under the BSP will be released and Enhancement Shares awarded under that plan will vest, only to the
extent that the applicable performance conditions have been satisfied; 
SA YE options may be exercised (to the extent of savings at the date of exercise); and
participants may direct the SIP trustee as to how to deal with their SIP shares (although the Matching Shares may be forfeited 
in some circumstances).
In the event that a director’s employment is terminated, vesting of outstanding share options is dependent upon the reasons the
contract is terminated. Performance conditions fall away in the event of redundancy. However, if the executive resigns voluntarily,
then all options lapse unless the Committee determines otherwise. 
In the case of LTIP interests, if a director resigns voluntarily, then his interests lapse. If he is made redundant, vesting at the end of
the performance period is based on the normal performance criteria and then pro-rated for the proportion of the performance period
for which the director served. 
7878v03_GC_Rp_28-p39_020305.qxp  4/3/05  2:10 am  Page 32 Anglo American plc Annual Report 2004 33
In the case of the BSP, if a director ceases to be employed before the end of the year in respect of which the annual performance
targets apply, then no award will be made unless the Committee determines otherwise (taking into account the proportion of the year
for which the director was an employee of the Group and of performance to date against the annual performance targets at the date 
of cessation). If a director resigns before the end of the three year vesting period, the Bonus Share awards lapse and the Enhancement
Shares are forfeited. If a director is made redundant, Bonus Share awards will be transferred as soon as practicable after the date of
leaving and the Enhancement Shares will vest at the end of the performance period, to the extent that the performance conditions
have been met.
Pensions
Pension and life insurance benefits for executive directors reflect practice in the countries in which they perform their principal duties.
Pension arrangements are tailored to take account of historic obligations and, insofar as agreed by the Committee, the personal
circumstances of each executive. Details of individual pension arrangements are set out on pages 39 and 40.
The Remuneration Committee is considering the impact on UK pension arrangements of the new UK pensions regime which will apply
from April 2006. Further details will be disclosed in the 2005 remuneration report.
Other benefits
Executive directors are entitled to the provision of either a car allowance or a fully expensed car, medical insurance, death and
disability insurance, social club membership (in accordance with local market practice), limited personal taxation/financial advice 
and reimbursement of reasonable business expenses. Directors based in South Africa are eligible to receive housing loan subsidies 
at a preferential interest rate in accordance with local market practice. The provision of these benefits is considered to be market
competitive in the appropriate locality for executive director positions.
Executive shareholding targets
Within five years of their appointment, executive directors are expected to acquire a holding of shares with a value of two times’
basic salary in the case of the chief executive and one times’ basic salary in the case of other executive directors. 
The Remuneration Committee will consider achievement against these targets when making grants under the various long term
incentive plans.
External appointments
Executive directors are not permitted to hold external directorships or offices without the approval of the board; if approved, they
may retain the fees payable from one such appointment. During the year ended 31 December 2004, B E Davison retained fees 
from one appointment amounting to £16,000.
Policy on non-executive directors’ remuneration
Non-executive directors’ remuneration is approved by the board as a whole on the recommendation of the chairman and 
executive directors.
The Company’s policy on non-executive directors’ remuneration is based on the following key principles. Remuneration should be: 
sufficient to attract and retain world-class non-executive talent; 
consistent with recognised best practice standards for non-executive directors’ remuneration;
in the form of cash fees, but with the flexibility to forgo all or part of such fees, to subscribe for shares in the Company 
if the non-executive director so wishes (after deduction of applicable income tax and social security contributions); and 
set by reference to the responsibilities taken on by the non-executives in chairing the board and its committees. 
Non-executive directors may not participate in the Company’s annual bonus plan, share option schemes, Long Term Incentive Plan 
or pension arrangements.
The board reviews non-executive directors’ fees periodically to ensure they remain market competitive. Additional fees are paid 
to the chairmen of board committees and to the senior independent director. Where non-executive directors have executive board
roles within subsidiaries of the Company, then they may also receive additional remuneration on account of these increased
responsibilities. With the exception of R M Godsell, who is remunerated by AngloGold Ashanti Limited in his capacity as its chief
executive, none of the non-executive directors has any such role.
Chairman’s fees
The chairman’s fees are approved by the board (in the absence of the chairman) on the recommendation of the Committee and chief
executive, who take external advice on market comparators.

Directors’ service contracts
It is the Company’s policy that the period of notice for executive directors will not exceed 12 months. 
In order properly to reflect their spread of responsibilities, all the executive directors, with the exception of A W Lea, who is
employed by Anglo American International (BVI) Limited, have contracts with Anglo American International (IOM) Limited and with
Anglo Operations Limited. The salaries under these contracts are payable in sterling and/or South African rand as appropriate. The
employment contracts of all executive directors are terminable at 12 months’ notice by either party.

At each annual general meeting (AGM) all those directors who have been in office for three years or more since their election or last re-election shall retire from office. Details of those retiring by
rotation this year are contained in the Notice of AGM. In addition, a director may at any AGM retire from office and stand for re-election.
The contracts of executive directors contain a provision that sets out the compensation payable in lieu of notice if the Company
terminates the contract (other than for cause) or if the executive director resigns in circumstances where there has been a material
adverse change in role, responsibilities or remuneration. Compensation is based on the value of 12 months’ basic salary, target
annual bonus for 12 months and the annual value of benefits. The Company may choose whether to continue to provide other
benefits during any notice period or to pay an amount equal to the gross value of these benefits over the period. Although the
Committee notes that this policy is no longer in complete compliance with the latest ABI guidelines, it has enabled the Company 
to remain market competitive in an historic context. As market practice has now moved away from the inclusion of liquidated
damages in service contracts, the Committee will review this policy in 2005 for new appointments to the board.
The contracts of executive directors do not provide for any enhanced payments in the event of a change of control of the Company.
All non-executive directors have letters of appointment with the Company for an initial period of three years from their date of
appointment, subject to re-election at the AGM. In addition to his letter of appointment with the Company, R M Godsell has a 
service contract with AngloGold Ashanti Limited, an independently managed subsidiary of the Company, in his capacity as its 
chief executive. Under this contract, his employment may be terminated by either party giving to the other 12 months’ notice.

Historical comparative TSR performance graphs
The graphs below represent the comparative TSR performance of the Company from 1 January 2000 to 31 December 2004. 
In drawing these graphs it has been assumed that all dividends paid have been reinvested.
The first graph shows the Company’s performance against the performance of the FTSE 100 Index, chosen as being a broad equity
market index consisting of companies of comparable size and complexity to Anglo American plc. This graph has been produced in
accordance with the requirements of Schedule 7A to the Companies Act 1985.
The second graph shows the Company’s performance against the weighted comparator group used to measure company performance
for the purposes of the vesting of LTIP interests awarded in 2002. This graph gives an indication of how Anglo American plc is
performing against the targets in place for LTIP interests already granted, although the specifics of the comparator companies for
each year’s interests may vary to reflect changes such as mergers and acquisitions amongst the Company’s competitors or changes
to the Company’s business mix.
The TSR level shown at 31 December each year is calculated in accordance with the LTIP rules. In particular, TSR is calculated in US
dollars, and the TSR level shown at 31 December each year is the average of the closing daily TSR levels for the six month period 
up to and including that date.
REMUNERATION OUTCOMES DURING 2004

Subsequent to their retirement from the board in 2001, L Boyd and M W King continue to hold non-executive directorships with certain listed subsidiaries of the Group. They received fees of
£29,000 (2003: £29,000) and £21,000 (2003: £26,000) respectively, for the provision of these services during the year. 
(2)
As A J Trahar, B E Davison and W A Nairn had no provision for past service in respect of their sterling-denominated pension fund, their employing company has contractually agreed that
supplementary pension contributions should be made to the Anglo American plc International Approved Pension Scheme in return for these executives having given up their right to part of their
future basic salary. The table above includes these amounts, which are £89,000, £47,000 and £42,000 respectively.

The 2004 performance bonus represents the cash element of the Bonus Share Plan payable in 2005. The share elements under this scheme for 2004 will be awarded during 2005.
(4)
Each director received a car allowance or a fully expensed car and a limited amount of personal taxation/financial advice. All directors received death and disability insurance and, with the exception
of W A Nairn, also received medical insurance. A J Trahar, A W Lea and W A Nairn received club membership; in addition, A J Trahar received a housing loan subsidy.
(5)
On retirement at 31 December 2004, W A Nairn received payment for accumulated untaken leave of £19,000 and an award to mark completion of 40 years of service of £2,000.

In light of his retirement on 31 December 2004, W A Nairn was not granted conditional awards under the BSP.
(2)
The BSP was approved by shareholders in 2004, as a replacement for the ESOS and the Deferred Bonus Plan. No BSP interests vested during 2004.
(3)
The value of the bonus under the BSP is calculated by reference to measures of both corporate performance (based on stretching EPS targets) as well as the achievement of specific individual
objectives. Details of the performance conditions applying to bonuses in 2004 are described in further detail on page 30. In 2004, the EPS targets were met in full. Half of the bonus is paid in
cash (which would not normally exceed 75% of basic salary for the chief executive and 60% of basic salary for the other directors) and the other half takes the form of a conditional award of
Bonus Shares equal in value to the cash element. The Bonus Shares vest if the director remains in employment with the Group until the end of a three year holding period. The market price of the
shares at the date of award of Bonus Shares made in 2004, in respect of 2003 performance, was £11.36 per share.
(4)
A conditional award of Enhancement Shares was made at the same time as the award of Bonus Shares (to a maximum of 75% of the face value of the Bonus Shares). Enhancement Shares
awarded in 2004 will only vest to the extent that a challenging performance condition based on EPS growth against the UK Retail Price Index is met. Further details of this performance condition
are provided on page 30. The market value of the shares on the date of award of the Enhancement Shares in 2004 was £11.36 per share.

(1)
The LTIP awards made in 2004 are conditional on two performance conditions as outlined on page 31: the first based on the Company’s TSR relative to a weighted group of international natural
resource companies and the second based on an underlying operating measure which focuses on raising Anglo American’s ROCE in the medium term. Further details on the structure of the LTIP, 
the required level of performance for the 2004 award and how performance against targets is measured can be found on pages 31 and 32. A second award during 2004, included in the table
above, was made to the executive directors subsequent to the AGM at which the BSP was approved (and the consequent rebalancing of the incentive structure as outlined on page 30). 
The market prices of the shares at the dates of award were £12.62 and £12.34 per share respectively.
(2)
The performance period applicable to each award is three years. The performance period relating to the 2001 LTIP awards (which were granted on 26 June 2001) ended on 31 December 2003.
Vesting was subject to two performance conditions: the first based on the Company’s TSR relative to a weighted group of international natural resource companies and the second based on an
underlying operating measure which focused on improvements in the Company’s ROCE in the medium term. Part of each award was based on the TSR measure and part on the operating measure.
The market price of the shares at the date of the first LTIP awards was £10.30 per share. The market price of the shares at the date of vesting of such awards was £13.07 per share.

In the case of the first LTIP awards, granted in 2001, for all executive directors except for B E Davison, the determinants for vesting
were 50% on relative TSR and 50% on meeting specified Group ROCE targets. In the case of B E Davison, to reflect his responsibility
for Anglo Platinum, in 2001 the targets were 50% relative TSR, 30% Group ROCE targets and 20% on Anglo Platinum specific
ROCE targets. The ROCE targets are a function of targeted improvement in returns on existing capital employed at the start of the
performance period and targeted returns in excess of the cost of capital on new capital investment over that period. The entry level
target for any LTIP has been the actual return achieved on the capital employed, excluding capital work in progress, in the year
immediately preceding the commencement of the performance period. In order to maintain the effectiveness of the plan in driving 
long term performance, the actual returns in the final performance year are adjusted for movements in commodity prices, certain
foreign exchange rate effects (e.g. translation windfalls), capital in progress (to reflect the fact that mines under construction absorb
large amounts of capital before producing a return), for relevant changes in the composition of the Group (e.g. significant acquisitions
and disposals) and other one-off factors which would otherwise result in a misleading outcome.
The threshold blended target (i.e. the target on existing and new capital) for the period was 17.4% and the upper blended target
19.4%. The ROCE achieved was 18.6% and the outcome on this element of the LTIP was thus 61.7%. On the TSR measure, 
Anglo American achieved a TSR over the three year performance period of 60% which generated a 54% vesting in terms of the
2001 Comparator Group. The overall vesting level for those directors with a 50% Group ROCE, 50% TSR split was therefore
57.9%. In the case of B E Davison, the ROCE element attributable to Anglo Platinum’s ROCE (20% of the total 2001 LTIP) failed 
to meet the threshold target. The overall outcome in his case therefore was 45.5%.

Certain of the executive directors were granted share options prior to 1 January 1999 under a previous share option scheme operated by Anglo American Corporation of South Africa Limited which
were ‘rolled over’ into Anglo American plc options.
(2)
Share options in respect of shares, the market price for which as at 31 December 2004 is equal to, or exceeds, the option exercise price. As at 31 December 2004, there were no share options
with an exercise price above the market price.
(3)
Options were granted having UK Inland Revenue approval (Approved Options) and without such approval (Unapproved Options). The exercise of these historical options is subject to Anglo
American’s EPS (calculated in accordance with FRS 14, based on the Company’s headline earnings measure) increasing by at least 6% above the UK Retail Price Index over a three year period. 
If the performance condition is not met at the end of the first three year period, then performance is retested each year over the ten year life of the option on a rolling three year basis. 
Options are normally exercisable, subject to satisfaction of the performance condition, between three and ten years from the date of grant. 
(4)
Beneficial holdings include SA YE options held by A J Trahar, A W Lea and W A Nairn of 3,792, 3,480 and 1,029 options respectively, with option prices per share of £4.85, £4.85 and £9.28
respectively. There are no performance conditions attached to these options.

5. Deferred Bonus Plan and Share Incentive Plan
In 2003 and earlier years, executive directors were required to defer 50% of their annual bonus under the Deferred Bonus Plan and
could, at the discretion of the Committee on a year-by-year basis, defer all of their bonus (net of tax) to acquire shares in the
Company. If these shares are held for three years they will be matched by the Company on a one-for-one basis, conditional upon the
executive director’s continued employment. No further awards were made to directors under the Deferred Bonus Plan during 2004.
The directors hold interests in deferred bonus matching shares as follows:

held by each of them at the beginning of the year. If these shares are held for three years, they will be matched by the Company 
on a one-for-one basis, conditional upon the director’s continued employment. Participants in the SIP scheme are entitled to receive
dividends from these matching shares upon vesting. No SIP matching shares vested during 2004.
6. Pensions
Directors’ pension arrangements
Each executive director, other than A W Lea, is a member of the Anglo American plc International Approved Pension Scheme
(the International Scheme), which is a defined contribution pension scheme.
A J Trahar participates in the International Scheme in terms of his contract with Anglo American International (IOM) Limited for
services to be rendered outside South Africa. Normal contributions were made on his behalf into the International Scheme at the rate
of 35% of the basic salary payable under this contract. He also participates in the Anglo American Corporation Pension Fund
(the Pension Fund) in respect of his South African contract, whereby he accrues an annual pension at the rate of 2.2% of
pensionable salary (as defined in the rules of that scheme) for each year of pensionable service. The Pension Fund provides spouse’s
benefits of two-thirds of the member’s pension on the death of a member. It does not have provision for guaranteed pension
increases.
Following previously announced senior management changes in South Africa, A J Trahar will increase the time he devotes to Group
matters globally. Accordingly, the Committee has decided that, with effect from January 2005, the proportion of his overall
remuneration paid under his South African contract will be reduced. The Committee has been advised that, as a consequence, his
pension payable on retirement out of the Pension Fund (his South African final salary defined benefit scheme) will be substantially
less than he would otherwise have accrued. The Committee has also been advised by independent professionally qualified actuaries
that to provide benefits of equivalent value to those forgone would require additional contributions into the International Scheme
amounting to £5.6 million, during 2005, which the Committee has decided should be paid. Normal contributions will continue to be
paid into the International Scheme with effect from January 2005, at the rate of 35% of the basic salary payable under his contract
with Anglo American International (IOM) Limited.
A W Lea participates in the Anglo American plc Approved Pension Scheme (formerly known as the Minorco Executive Directors’
Fund). This scheme is also a defined contribution pension scheme. Prior to the formation of the Company in May 1999, A W Lea
was entitled to employer contributions at a rate of 35% of the basic salary under his contract with Anglo American International
(BVI) Limited, a commitment which continues to be honoured. A W Lea is also entitled to deferred benefits in the Pension Fund in
respect of previous South African service.
B E Davison participates in the International Scheme in terms of his contract with Anglo American International (IOM) Limited; normal
contributions are made on his behalf at the rate of 25% of the basic salary payable under this contract. He also participates in the
Anglo American Corporation Retirement Fund, whereby contributions are made at the rate of 15% of basic salary (plus car allowance
for historical reasons), under his South African contract. He elected to join this scheme when it was established in September 1998
and transferred his accrued benefits from the Pension Fund, of which he was previously a member.
W A Nairn participated until his retirement at 31 December 2004 in the International Scheme in terms of his contract with Anglo
American International (IOM) Limited; normal contributions were made on his behalf at the rate of 25% of the basic salary payable
under this contract. He was also entitled to contributions at the rate of 14% of basic salary (plus car allowance for historical
reasons) to an independent personal retirement plan located in South Africa, under his South African contract. 
No pension costs were incurred in respect of the non-executive directors, with the exception of R M Godsell, who continued to be a
member of the AngloGold Ashanti Pension Fund (a defined benefit pension scheme) in his capacity as chief executive of that company.

Defined contribution pension schemes
The amounts paid into defined contribution pension schemes by the Group in respect of the individual directors were as follows:
Normal contributions

A J Trahar 156 142
B E Davison 97 90
A W Lea 179 166
W A Nairn 89 81
(1)
As Messrs Trahar, Davison and Nairn have no provision for past service in respect of their sterling-denominated pension fund, their employing company has contractually agreed that supplementary
pension contributions should be made to the International Scheme in return for these executives having given up their right to part of their future basic salary. These supplementary contributions,
of £89,000 (2003: £81,000), £47,000 (2003: £43,000) and £42,000 (2003: £38,000) respectively, are disclosed in the directors’ emoluments table on page 35.
Defined benefit pension schemes
A J Trahar and A W Lea are eligible for membership of the Pension Fund in respect of their South African remuneration (or, in the
case of A W Lea, his past service in South Africa). The Pension Fund is a funded final salary occupational pension scheme approved
by the Financial Services Board and the Commissioner of Inland Revenue in South Africa.

and £171,000 respectively. 
(2)
The increase in transfer value above 2003’s figure arises from currency differences, salary increases and, in the case of A J Trahar, 12 months’ additional pensionable service. 
(3)
In his capacity as chief executive of AngloGold Ashanti, R M Godsell is entitled to membership of the AngloGold Ashanti Pension Fund.
The transfer values disclosed above do not represent a sum paid or payable to the individual director; instead, they represent
potential liabilities of the pension schemes.
7. Excess retirement benefits
No person who served as a director of the Company during or before 2004 has been paid or received retirement benefits in excess
of the retirement benefits to which he was entitled on the date on which benefits first became payable (or 31 March 1997,
whichever is later).
8. Sums paid to third parties in respect of a director’s services
No consideration was paid to or became receivable by third parties for making available the services of any person: as a director 
of the Company, or while a director of the Company, as a director of any of the Company’s subsidiary undertakings, or as a director
of any other undertaking of which he was (while a director of the Company) a director by virtue of the Company’s nomination, 
or otherwise in connection with the management of the Company or any undertaking during the year to 31 December 2004.

INDEPENDENT REMUNERATION REPORT REVIEW
This letter reports on the results of the review carried out by Mercer Human Resource Consulting Limited of the processes followed
by the Anglo American Remuneration Committee (the Committee) that support the Remuneration Report for the financial year 2004.
Mercer undertook the review at the request of the chairman of the Committee in order to provide shareholders with assurance
that the remuneration processes followed are appropriate and that the Committee has complied with the policies set out in the
Remuneration Report.
In order to reach our opinion, we reviewed the Committee’s Terms of Reference and the minutes of its meetings held during 
the year as well as material presented to the Committee for its review. We also interviewed the chairman and secretary of 
the Committee. Our review was not intended to audit the compensation data set forth in the Remuneration Report or to evaluate
the merits of Anglo American’s remuneration programme.
Based on our review, Mercer is of the opinion that the process followed by the Committee during 2004 was fully consistent with
its Terms of Reference and that the decisions taken by the Committee were in line with the principles set out in the Remuneration
Report. It continues to be our view that the Committee takes a suitably robust approach to its work. We would note in particular
the changes to long term incentive arrangements which have been proposed in response to dialogue held with institutional
investors.
We note that the Committee has refined its modus operandi each year, taking into account any comments we have made in our
reviews. As a result, we believe that the Anglo American Remuneration Committee is exemplary in its conduct, decision-making
and reporting. 
The members of the Remuneration Committee have received training and are regularly updated on executive compensation 
and corporate governance matters.
Further detail regarding the Mercer review is included in a letter of this date addressed to the Committee chairman, which we
understand will be made available on the Company’s website.

STATEMENT OF DIRECTORS’ 
RESPONSIBILITIES
United Kingdom company law requires the directors to prepare
financial statements for each financial year which give a true
and fair view of the state of affairs of the Company and the
Group as at the end of the financial year and of the profit or 
loss of the Group for that period. In preparing those financial
statements, the directors are required to:
• select suitable accounting policies and then 
apply them consistently;
• make judgements and estimates that are 
reasonable and prudent;
• state whether applicable accounting standards 
have been followed; and
• prepare the financial statements on the going 
concern basis unless it is inappropriate to presume 
that the Group will continue in business.
The directors are responsible for keeping proper accounting
records which disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the
financial position of the Company and the Group and enable
them to ensure that the financial statements comply with the
Companies Act 1985. They are also responsible for the system
of internal control, safeguarding the assets of the Company and
the Group and hence for taking reasonable steps for the
prevention and detection of fraud and other irregularities.

INDEPENDENT AUDITORS’ REPORT TO THE MEMBERS 
OF ANGLO AMERICAN plc
We have audited the financial statements of Anglo American plc
for the year ended 31 December 2004 which comprise the
consolidated profit and loss account, the consolidated balance
sheet, the consolidated cash flow statement, the consolidated
statement of total recognised gains and losses, the Company
balance sheet and the related notes 1 to 38. These financial
statements have been prepared under the accounting policies 
set out therein. We have also audited the information 
specified by the Directors’ Remuneration Report Regulations
2002 to be audited which is set out in sections 1 to 8 of the
remuneration report. 
This report is made solely to the Company’s members, as a
body, in accordance with section 235 of the Companies Act
1985. Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might
state to the Company’s members those matters we are required
to state to them in an auditors’ report and for no other purpose.
To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or
assume responsibility to anyone other than the Company and
the Company’s members as a body, for our audit work, for this
report, or for the opinions we have formed.
RESPECTIVE RESPONSIBILITIES
OF DIRECTORS AND AUDITORS
As described in the statement of directors’ responsibilities, the
Company’s directors are responsible for the preparation of 
the financial statements in accordance with applicable United
Kingdom law and accounting standards. They are also
responsible for the preparation of the other information
contained in the annual report including the directors’
remuneration report. Our responsibility is to audit the financial
statements and the part of the directors’ remuneration report
described as having been audited in accordance with relevant
United Kingdom legal and regulatory requirements and auditing
standards.
We report to you our opinion as to whether the financial
statements give a true and fair view and whether the financial
statements and the part of the directors’ remuneration report
described as having been audited have been properly prepared 
in accordance with the Companies Act 1985. We also report to
you if, in our opinion, the directors’ report is not consistent with
the financial statements, if the Company has not kept proper
accounting records, if we have not received all the information
and explanations we require for our audit, or if information
specified by law regarding directors’ remuneration and
transactions with the Company and other members of the 
Group is not disclosed.
We review whether the corporate governance statement reflects
the Company’s compliance with the nine provisions of the July
2003 FRC Combined Code specified for our review by the Listing
Rules of the Financial Services Authority, and we report if it does
not. We are not required to consider whether the board’s
statements on internal control cover all risks and controls, or
form an opinion on the effectiveness of the Group’s corporate
governance procedures or its risk and control procedures.
We read the directors’ report and the other information contained
in the annual report for the above year as described in the
contents section including the unaudited part of the directors’
remuneration report and consider the implications for our report
if we become aware of any apparent misstatements or material
inconsistencies with the financial statements.
BASIS OF AUDIT OPINION
We conducted our audit in accordance with United Kingdom
auditing standards issued by the Auditing Practices Board. 
An audit includes examination, on a test basis, of evidence
relevant to the amounts and disclosures in the financial
statements and the part of the directors’ remuneration report
described as having been audited. It also includes an assessment
of the significant estimates and judgements made by the
directors in the preparation of the financial statements and 
of whether the accounting policies are appropriate to the
circumstances of the Company and the Group, consistently
applied and adequately disclosed.
We planned and performed our audit so as to obtain all the
information and explanations which we considered necessary in
order to provide us with sufficient evidence to give reasonable
assurance that the financial statements and the part of the
directors’ remuneration report described as having been audited
are free from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud 
or other irregularity or error. In forming our opinion, we also
evaluated the overall adequacy of the presentation of
information in the financial statements and the part of the
directors’ remuneration report described as having been audited.
OPINION
In our opinion:
• the financial statements give a true and fair view of the state
of affairs of the Company and the Group as at 31 December
2004 and of the profit of the Group for the year then ended;
and 
• the financial statements and part of the directors’ remuneration
report described as having been audited have been properly
prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 1985.

AngloGold merged with Ashanti Goldfields Company Limited on 26 April 2004. As a result of this transaction, the Group’s shareholding decreased from 55.8% to 47.2% and the Group has
therefore accounted for a deemed disposal in accordance with FRS 2 ‘Accounting for subsidiary undertakings’. The holding was subsequently increased to 51% through the purchase of additional
shares.
(2)
The Group has adopted UITF abstract 38 ‘Accounting for ESOP trusts’. As required by this abstract, own shares held by employee trusts have been reclassified from other investments and are now
recorded as a reduction in shareholders’ funds. See note 1 to the financial statements. This change has been accounted for as a prior year adjustment and prior year numbers have been restated
accordingly. The impact of adopting this abstract is to reduce net assets and shareholders’ funds by $622 million at 1 January 2004 (1 January 2003: $630 million).

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
1 ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Basis of preparation
The financial statements have been prepared according to the
historical cost convention, and in accordance with accounting
standards applicable in the United Kingdom.
The accounting policies applied in preparing the financial
statements are consistent with those adopted and disclosed 
in the Group’s financial statements for the year ended 
31 December 2003 with the addition of UITF abstract 38
‘Accounting for ESOP trusts’, which has been adopted for the
first time this year. As required by this abstract, own shares 
held by employee trusts have been reclassified from other
investments and are now recorded as a reduction in
shareholders’ funds. This change has been accounted for as a
prior year adjustment and previously reported figures have been
restated accordingly. The impact of adopting this abstract is to
reduce net assets and shareholders’ funds by $622 million at 
1 January 2004 (1 January 2003: $630 million).
Basis of consolidation
The ﬁnancial statements comprise a consolidation of the
ﬁnancial statements of the Company and all its subsidiaries 
and incorporate the results of its share of joint ventures and
associates on a gross equity and equity basis respectively. The
financial statements also include the Group’s share of the results
of joint arrangements that are not entities as set out below.
Revenue recognition
Turnover amounts are measured at the fair value of consideration
received or receivable, after deducting trade discounts, volume
rebates, value added tax, treatment and refining charges where
applicable and other sales taxes. Turnover from metal mining
activities is based on the payable metal sold. 
Acquisitions and goodwill arising thereon
Where an investment in a subsidiary, joint venture or an
associate is made, any difference between the purchase price
and the fair value of the attributable net assets is recognised as
goodwill. Goodwill is amortised over its estimated useful life up
to a maximum of 20 years. Goodwill in respect of subsidiaries is
included within intangible ﬁxed assets. Goodwill relating to joint
ventures and associates is included within the carrying value 
of the joint venture or associate. The unamortised balance is
reviewed on a regular basis and, if an impairment in value has
occurred, it is written off in the period in which the
circumstances are identified.
Joint ventures
A joint venture is an entity in which the Group holds a long term
interest and which is jointly controlled by the Group and one or
more other partner under a contractual arrangement. The Group’s
share of the results of joint ventures is accounted for using the
gross equity method of accounting.
Associates
The equity method of accounting is used for investments over
which the Group exercises signiﬁcant influence. Typically the
Group owns between 20% and 50% of the voting equity of its
associates.
Results of associates are equity accounted from their most
recent audited ﬁnancial statements or unaudited interim
statements. Any losses of associates are accounted for in the
consolidated ﬁnancial statements. 
The carrying values of investments in associates represent the
cost of each investment including unamortised goodwill, the
share of post-acquisition retained earnings and any other
movements in reserves. The carrying value of associates is
reviewed on a regular basis and if an impairment in value has
occurred, it is written off in the period in which those
circumstances are identified.
Joint arrangements
The Group has contractual arrangements with other participants
to engage in joint activities that do not create an entity carrying
on a trade of its own. The Group includes its share of the
assets, liabilities, income, expenditure and cash flows in such
joint arrangements, measured in accordance with the terms of
each arrangement, which is usually pro rata to the Group’s
interest in the joint arrangement.
Investments
Investments, other than investments in subsidiaries, joint
ventures and associates, are included at cost less provision for
any impairment in value.
Tangible fixed assets
Mining properties and leases include the cost of acquiring and
developing mining properties, mineral rights and investments in
and loans to companies holding mineral rights. Mining properties
are depreciated using the unit of production method based on
proven and probable reserves. Depreciation is charged on new
mining ventures from the date when the mining property is
capable of commercial production. When there is little likelihood
of a mineral right being exploited, or the value of the exploitable
mineral right has diminished below cost, a write-down is charged
against proﬁts. Stripping costs incurred during the production
phase to remove additional overburden or waste ore are deferred
and charged to operating costs on the basis of the average life
of mine.
Interest on borrowings relating to the ﬁnancing of major capital
projects under construction is capitalised during the construction
phase as part of the cost of the project. Where funds have been
borrowed speciﬁcally to ﬁnance a project, the amount capitalised
represents the actual borrowing costs incurred. Where the funds
used to ﬁnance a project form part of general borrowings, the
amount capitalised is calculated using a weighted average of
rates applicable to relevant general borrowings during the period.
Land and properties in the course of construction are not
depreciated. Buildings, plant and equipment are depreciated at
varying rates, on the straight-line basis over their estimated
useful lives. Estimated useful lives normally vary up to 20 years
for items of plant and equipment and up to a maximum of 
50 years for buildings.
Assets held under finance leases are depreciated over the
shorter of the lease term and the useful lives of the assets.
Impairments
The carrying values of fixed assets are reviewed for impairment
if events or changes in circumstances indicate that they may not
be recoverable. Any provision for impairment is charged against
profit in the year concerned. In addition, first year impairment
reviews are conducted for acquired goodwill. Impairment is
determined by reference to the higher of net realisable value and
value in use, which is measured by reference to discounted
future cashflows. The discount rate applied is based upon the
Group’s weighted average cost of capital, with adjustment made
for local conditions where appropriate.
7878v04_GC_Rp_p44-89_020305.qxp  3/3/05  8:04 pm  Page 52 Anglo American plc Annual Report 2004 53
Research and exploration expenditure
Research and exploration expenditure is written off in the year 
in which it is incurred. When a decision is taken that a mining
property becomes viable for commercial production, all further
pre-production expenditure is capitalised. Capitalisation of 
pre-production expenditure ceases when the mining property 
is capable of commercial production.
Stocks
Stocks and work in progress are valued at the lower of cost and
net realisable value. The production cost of stocks includes an
appropriate proportion of depreciation and production overheads.
Cost is determined on the following bases:
• raw materials and consumables are valued at cost on a ﬁrst-
in, ﬁrst-out (FIFO) basis;
• metal, coal and coke stocks are valued at average cost; and
• finished products are valued at raw material cost, labour cost
and a proportion of manufacturing overhead expenses.
Current asset investments
Current asset investments consist mainly of bank term deposits
and ﬁxed and floating rate debt securities. Debt securities that are
intended to be held to maturity are recorded on the amortised
cost basis. Debt securities that are not intended to be held to
maturity are recorded at the lower of cost and market value. 
Retirement benefits
The Group operates both defined benefit and defined contribution
schemes for its employees. For defined contribution schemes the
amount charged to the profit and loss account is the
contributions paid during the year. 
The expected costs of providing post-retirement beneﬁts under
deﬁned beneﬁt arrangements are charged against proﬁts to
spread the expected costs on a straight-line basis over the
service lives of employees entitled to those beneﬁts. Costs are
assessed in accordance with the advice of qualiﬁed actuaries
using the projected unit method. Experience adjustments and
prior service costs resulting from plan amendments are
amortised over the expected average remaining service lives of
relevant current employees. The difference between pension
cost and funding is treated as a provision or prepayment.
The Group continues to account for post-retirement benefits
under the transitional arrangements for FRS 17 ‘Retirement
Benefits’.
Restoration, rehabilitation and environmental costs
An obligation to incur restoration, rehabilitation and environmental
costs arises when environmental disturbance is caused by the
development or ongoing production of a mine or quarry. Such costs
arising from the installation of plant and other site preparation
work, discounted to their net present value, are provided for and
capitalised at the start of each project, as soon as the obligation 
to incur such costs arises. These costs are charged against profits
over the life of the operation, through the depreciation of the asset
and the unwinding of the discount on the provision. Costs for
restoration of subsequent site damage which is created on an
ongoing basis during production are provided for at their net
present values and charged against profits as extraction progresses.
Deferred taxation
Deferred taxation is provided in full on all timing differences that
result in an obligation at the balance sheet date to pay more 
tax, or a right to pay less tax, at a future date, subject to the
recoverability of deferred tax assets. Deferred tax assets and
liabilities are not discounted.
Leases 
Rental costs under operating leases are charged to the proﬁt and
loss account in equal annual amounts over the lease term.
Finance lease obligations are recorded at the inception of the
lease as the present value of the minimum lease payments,
derived by discounting at the interest rate implicit in the lease.
The interest element of the rental is charged against profit.
Foreign currency translation
Foreign currency transactions by Group companies are booked 
in local currency at the exchange rate ruling on the date of
transaction, or at the forward rate if hedged by a forward
contract. The proﬁt and loss account of foreign subsidiaries, 
joint ventures and associates as well as the cash flow
statements of foreign subsidiaries are translated at weighted
average rates of exchange, other than material exceptional items
which are translated at the rate on the date of the transaction.
Assets and liabilities are translated at the exchange rate
prevailing at the balance sheet date, or at the forward rate 
if hedged by a forward contract.
Exchange differences on the translation of the net assets of
subsidiaries less offsetting exchange differences on foreign
currency loans ﬁnancing these assets, are recorded as a
movement in reserves and in the consolidated statement of total
recognised gains and losses.
All other exchange gains or losses on settlement of foreign
currency transactions translated at the rate prevailing at the date
of the transactions, or the translation of monetary assets and
liabilities at year-end exchange rates, are recorded in the proﬁt
and loss account.
Hedging transactions
In order to hedge its exposure to foreign exchange, interest rate
and commodity price risks, the Group enters into forward, option
and swap contracts. Gains and losses on these contracts are
recognised in the period to which the gains and losses of the
underlying transactions relate. Net income or expense associated
with interest rate swap agreements is recognised on the accrual
basis over the life of the swap agreements as a component of
interest. Where commodity option contracts hedge anticipated
future production or purchases, the Group amortises the option
premiums paid over the life of the option and recognises any
realised gains and losses on exercise in the period in which the
hedged production is sold or commodity purchases are made.
Employee share awards
The estimated cost of awards made by the Group is charged to
profit over the performance period, as appropriate. Where shares
are held by an employee benefit trust the carrying value of these
shares is recorded as a reduction in shareholders’ funds. The
estimated cost of awards is the market value of shares awarded
or the intrinsic value of the awards (being the difference
between the exercise price of the award and the market price at
the date of grant) adjusted to reflect performance conditions
where applicable. The Group has taken advantage of the
exemption given in Urgent Issues Task Force (UITF) Abstract 17
‘Employee share schemes’, in respect of Save As You Earn
schemes.
Reporting currency
As permitted by UK company law, the Group reports in US
dollars, the currency in which most of its business is conducted.

Turnover is measured at the fair value of consideration received or receivable for all significant products. Where a by-product is not regarded as significant, revenue may be credited against the cost
of sales. The amount credited to cost of sales for the year ended 31 December 2004 was $81 million (2003: $55 million) and relates principally to AngloGold Ashanti which credits uranium and
silver to cost of sales in accordance with the Gold Industry Standard on production costs.

Net operating assets consist of tangible assets, intangible assets, stocks and operating debtors less non-interest bearing current liabilities. See note 35 for the reconciliation of net operating assets
to net assets.

2004 Base Metals’ turnover is stated net of treatment and refining charges on concentrate sales to external parties and refining charges on copper anode sales from Chagres to refineries. On this
basis, 2003 total Base Metals’ turnover would be $1,957 million. There is no impact on operating profit for either 2004 or 2003.

Headline earnings for Paper and Packaging and Corporate Activities have been adjusted for the year ended 31 December 2003, as net interest for the wholly-owned operations in Paper 
and Packaging is now accounted for centrally within Corporate Activities. Net interest payable for the wholly-owned operations in Paper and Packaging was $95 million for the year ended 
31 December 2004 (2003: $57 million). On the former basis headline earnings for Paper and Packaging would have been $286 million for the year ended 31 December 2004 
(2003: $368 million).

Operating exceptional items
A review of the carrying value of Black Mountain Mineral Development has resulted in a $100 million exceptional charge to operating
profit, attributable to Base Metals.
Following a review of operations at Empresa Minera de Mantos Blancos SA, the carrying values of certain dump leach assets were
written down. This has resulted in an exceptional charge to operating profit of $20 million, attributable to Base Metals.
During the year, in light of the prolonged recovery in the company’s markets and share price, Ferrous Metals and Industries reversed
$154 million of the impairment provision held against Terra Industries Inc.
Palabora, an associate within Base Metals, recorded an impairment of $409 million during the year. The Group’s share of this
impairment amounted to $117 million.
Where impairment provisions have been made by subsidiaries, impairment is determined by reference to the higher of net realisable
value and value in use. The relevant review during the year was based on estimated value in use, using pre-tax discount rates
equivalent to a real post-tax discount rate of six per cent.

10 TAX ON PROFIT ON ORDINARY ACTIVITIES CONTINUED
b) Factors affecting current tax charge for the year
The current tax charge assessed for the year is lower than the standard rate of corporation tax in the United Kingdom and South
Africa (30%). The differences are explained below:

Effect of differences between local and UK rates (98) (66)
Other differences (95) (90)
Current tax charge for the year 1,038 564
c) Factors that may affect future tax charges 
The Group anticipates that its effective rate will remain above the statutory rate of 30% as the Group operates in certain countries
where tax rates are higher than the UK rate, including South Africa (effective rate of 37.8% assuming distribution of profits).
Details of the deferred tax provision are given in note 23. In addition to the amounts provided in deferred tax, unrecognised assets
exist in respect of taxable losses. No asset has been recognised in respect of these losses as it is not regarded as more likely than
not that there will be suitable taxable profits against which to offset these losses. Any utilisation of these losses in the future may
lead to a reduction in effective tax rates.
No deferred tax has been provided in respect of accumulated reserves of overseas subsidiaries, associates or joint ventures as future
dividends are expected to be paid out of future earnings.

The market value of the convertible debt at 31 December 2004 was $2,061 million (2003: $1,261 million).
Anglo American Capital plc and Anglo American Australia Finance Limited issued a number of small value bonds through 
reverse enquiries under the $3,000 million Euro Medium Term Note Programme. The total value issued was $550 million 
(2003: $143 million). All notes are guaranteed by Anglo American plc.
A $1,000 million European Commercial Paper Programme was established in October 2004. The programme was established to
provide further funding diversity and flexibility. The European Commercial Paper Programme is in addition to a $1,300 million
Canadian Commercial Paper Programme established a number of years ago.
In April 2002, Anglo American plc issued $1.1 billion 3
3
⁄ 8 per cent convertible bonds, due 17 April 2007, convertible into ordinary
shares of Anglo American plc. The bonds were issued at par and bear a coupon of 3
3
⁄ 8 per cent per annum, payable semi-annually.
The conversion price is £16.13 which represents a premium of 35% over the closing price of the shares in London at the date of
offer. The bonds can be converted by the holder at any time between 28 May 2002 and up to 14 business days prior to 17 April
2007. The total number of ordinary shares of 50 US cents each which could be issued on conversion is 47,589,607. The bonds can
be redeemed by Anglo American plc at their principal amount at any time after 9 May 2005, if the share price is at least 130% of
the conversion price for 20 dealing days within a 30 day dealing period. The bonds can also be redeemed by Anglo American plc at
their principal amount once conversion rights have been exercised in respect of 85% of the principal amount of the bonds. If not
converted or previously redeemed the bonds will be redeemed at par on 17 April 2007.
A Convertible Bond was issued in February 2004 by AngloGold Holdings Plc, a wholly-owned subsidiary of AngloGold Ashanti. 
The Bond is convertible into American Depositary Shares (ADSs) at a price of $65.00 per ADS up to 27 February 2009. The
proceeds of the issue, after payment of expenses, were utilised by AngloGold Ashanti to refinance amounts outstanding under 
credit facilities, to meet transaction costs in connection with the acquisition of Ashanti and for general corporate purposes, 
including planned capital expenditure.

22 DERIVATIVES AND OTHER FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS
Treasury and risk management
A discussion of the objectives, policies and strategies of Group Treasury and Risk Management is given in the financial review on page 14.
Summary of the use of derivative instruments by the Group
The Group utilises derivative and equity instruments to manage its exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates,
interest rates and commodity prices. The use of derivative instruments can give rise to credit and market risk. The Group controls
credit risk by entering into derivative contracts only with counterparties who are rated A1/P1, A or better by external rating agencies
or who have received specific internal corporate credit approval. The use of derivative instruments is subject to limits and the
positions are regularly monitored and reported to senior management. Market risk is the possibility that future changes in foreign
currency exchange rates, interest rates and commodity prices may make a derivative instrument more or less valuable. Since the
Group utilises derivative instruments for risk management, market risk relating to derivative instruments will principally be offset by
changes in the valuation of the underlying assets, liabilities or transactions being hedged.
Foreign exchange risk
The Group uses forward exchange contracts, currency swaps and option contracts to limit the effects of movements in exchange
rates on foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities. The Group also uses these instruments to hedge future transactions 
and cash flows. As at 31 December 2004 the net amount of unrecognised hedging gains on all foreign exchange risk-related
instruments, which had been deferred to a period in respect of which an exposure has been hedged, was $8 million (2003: gain 
$79 million). Any ultimate gain or loss resulting from these contracts will be recognised when the instruments expire.
Interest rate risk
The Group uses interest rate swap and option contracts to manage its exposure to interest rate movements on a portion of its
existing debt and short term investments. The effect of these derivatives is reflected, as appropriate, in interest expense or interest
income. As at 31 December 2004 the net amount of unrecognised hedging gains on all interest rate risk related instruments, which
had been deferred to a period in respect of which an exposure has been hedged, was $1 million (2003: losses $30 million).

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
CONTINUED
22 DERIVATIVES AND OTHER FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS CONTINUED
Commodity price risk
The Group uses forward, spot deferred and option contracts to hedge the price risk of certain commodities that it produces, including
gold and copper, and in respect of heating oil purchases. Gains or losses resulting from these activities are recognised concurrently with
gains and losses associated with underlying transactions. The majority of the deferred gains or losses are unrecognised and the ultimate
amount of gains or losses to be realised will depend on commodity price movements until the end of the hedge contracts concerned.
The net forward position of AngloGold Ashanti was 10.5 million ounces priced forward at 31 December 2004, covering periods up
to December 2014, with a marked to market value of negative $1,161 million at 31 December 2004. The value was based on a
gold price of $435/oz, exchange rates of $/ZAR5.67 and $/AU$1.29 and the prevailing market interest rates and volatilities at the
time. As at 25 January 2005, the marked to market value of the hedge book was a negative $993 million, based on a gold price of
$426/oz, exchange rates of $/ZAR5.93 and $/AU$1.30 and the prevailing market interest rates and volatilities at the time.
Concentration of credit risk
The Group is exposed to credit risk in respect of current asset investments, debtors and derivative financial instruments. Given the
geographical and business diversity of the Group’s debtors, the concentration of credit risk is limited. In respect of current asset
investments and derivative financial instruments, procedures and policies are in place to limit the amount of credit exposure to any
one counterparty. The maximum credit risk exposure is limited to fair value (see note 22(b) below).
Numerical disclosures
The disclosures present information regarding the Group as a whole and therefore exclude any intra-group loan balances. The
disclosure of financial assets and financial liabilities which follows (other than the currency disclosures in note 22(e)) excludes
debtors and other current liabilities, as permitted under FRS 13 ‘Derivatives and other financial instruments: disclosures’.

The following methods were used to estimate the fair value of the financial assets and liabilities:
Long term investments – fair value represents the market value of quoted investments and directors’ valuation of other
investments;
Current asset investments – fair value is based on market prices for quoted short term investments. For non-quoted investments fair
value is based on market prices of similar investments;
Convertible debt – fair value is based on the quoted market value of the convertible bonds;
Short and long term debt – fair value is determined by reference to quoted market prices for similar issues, where applicable,
otherwise carrying value is used as an approximation to fair value; and
Derivative instruments – fair value is determined by reference to market prices where available, otherwise pricing or valuation
models are applied to current market information to estimate their value.

the market value of the 56.7 million shares held by the trust was $1,225 million.

AngloGold merged with Ashanti Goldfields Company Limited on 26 April 2004. As a result of this transaction, the Group’s
shareholding decreased from 55.8% to 47.2% and the Group has therefore had to account for a deemed disposal in accordance with
FRS2 ‘Accounting for subsidiary undertakings’. The holding was subsequently increased to 51% through the purchase of additional
shares. 
As a result of the deemed disposal on the merger of AngloGold with Ashanti Goldfields Company Limited an unrealised profit of
$410 million has been recorded in the Statement of Total Recognised Gains and Losses.
Subsidiaries disposed of in the year principally include Hudson Bay, which was sold in December 2004.
The cash flows of the disposed subsidiaries did not have a material effect on the cash flow statement.

31 CONTINGENT LIABILITIES
Contingent liabilities comprise aggregate amounts of $272 million (2003: $290 million) in respect of loans and performance
guarantees given to banks and other third parties. 
AngloGold North America has $30 million of reclamation bonds with various federal and governmental agencies, to cover potential
environmental obligations. These obligations are guaranteed by AngloGold Ashanti Limited.
There are a number of legal or potential claims against the Group, the outcome of which cannot at present be foreseen. Provision is
made for all liabilities that are expected to materialise.
In addition to the amounts relating to Group companies above, under Chilean law payment of customs duties associated with capital
assets can be deferred for up to seven years. As at 31 December 2004, Collahuasi has potential deferred customs duties of $3 million
(2003: $11 million).

33 RETIREMENT BENEFITS
The Group operates defined contribution and defined benefit pension plans for the majority of its employees. It also operates post-
retirement medical arrangements in southern Africa and North America. The policy for accounting for pensions and post-retirement
benefits is included in note 1.
The assets of the defined contribution plans are held separately in independently administered funds. The charge in respect of these
plans is calculated on the basis of contributions payable by the Group in the financial year. 
The post-retirement medical arrangements provide health benefits to retired employees and certain dependants. Eligibility for cover is
dependent upon certain criteria. The majority of these plans are unfunded. 
The majority of the defined benefit pension plans are funded. The assets of these plans are held separately from those of the Group
in independently administered funds, in accordance with statutory requirements or local practice throughout the world. The unfunded
pension plans are principally in Europe and South America.
The retirement benefit charge for the year is as follows:
US$ million 2004 2003
Defined contribution pension plans 167 131
Defined benefit pension plans 106 108
Post-retirement medical plans 55 54
Defined contribution plans
The defined contribution pension cost represents the actual contributions payable by the Group to the various plans. At 31 December
2004, there were no material outstanding/prepaid contributions and so no prepayment or accrual has been disclosed in the balance
sheet in relation to these plans. 
Defined benefit plans
The above defined benefit pension plan cost consists of a regular cost of $73 million (2003: $63 million) and a variation cost of
$33 million (2003: $45 million). The Group adopts a straight-line method of amortising unrecognised amounts over the future
working lifetimes of active employees.
Post-retirement medical plans
The accumulated benefit obligation and the annual cost of accrual of benefits are assessed by independent qualified actuaries 
using the projected unit method. The accumulated benefit obligation calculated as at 31 December 2004 was $632 million
(2003: $527 million). The provision recorded on the balance sheet as at 31 December 2004 amounted to $529 million
(2003: $465 million).

Defined benefit pension plans
Qualified actuaries carry out full valuations every three years using the projected unit method. The actuaries have updated the
valuations to 31 December 2004. The actuary to the majority of the South African pension plans is an employee of the Group and is
supported by external advisors. The actuaries to the other plans are independent of the Group. 
At 31 December 2004 the estimated market value of the assets of the funded pension plans was $3,479 million (2003: $2,831
million). The market value of assets was used to determine the funding level of the plans. The market value of the assets of the
funded plans was sufficient to cover 91% (2003: 90%) of the benefits that had accrued to members after allowing for expected
increases in future earnings and pensions. In particular, the funding levels of the UK funded pension plans have fallen in the past
year as a result of an increase in the inflation assumption, although this has been offset by increasing asset values. Companies
within the Group are paying contributions as required in accordance with local actuarial advice. 
As the majority of the defined benefit pension plans are closed to new members, it is expected that contributions will increase as 
the members age. The benefit obligations in respect of the unfunded plans at 31 December 2004 were $182 million (2003:
$154 million).
To the extent that there is a difference between pension costs and contributions paid, a prepayment or provision arises. 
The accumulated difference provided in the balance sheet at 31 December 2004 gives rise to a prepayment of $178 million 
(2003: $170 million) and a provision of $224 million (2003: $216 million).
Actuarial assumptions
The principal assumptions used to determine the actuarial present value of benefit obligations and pension costs under SSAP 24 are
detailed below (shown as weighted averages):

FRS 17 background
In November 2000 the Accounting Standards Board issued FRS 17 ‘Retirement Benefits’ replacing SSAP 24 ‘Accounting for Pension
Costs’. The full implementation of FRS 17 has been deferred, though certain disclosures are required in the transition period for
periods ending on or after 22 June 2001. These further disclosures are included below. 
Under SSAP 24, the projected unit method was one of the acceptable valuation methods. Under FRS 17, it is the only acceptable
method of valuation. The pension plans have been valued historically using the projected unit method and so there is no change to
the method of valuation of the defined benefit plans.

FRS 17 balance sheet disclosure
Under FRS 17, the assumption for the average discount rate for plan liabilities is based on AA corporate bonds of a suitable duration
and currency. The discount rate and other actuarial assumptions are generally the same as for SSAP 24 and are given above. As
stated above, the principal funded schemes all relate to defined benefit pension plans. The market value of the assets in these plans
and the long term expected rate of return as at 31 December 2004, 31 December 2003 and 31 December 2002 are detailed below.

The Group is continuing to review the impact of legislation passed in 2001 in South Africa on the useable surpluses in its South
African plans. The actuaries to the Group plans have not yet finalised their calculations in respect of the apportionment of the
surplus from the plans. The liabilities shown above in respect of South Africa have been increased where applicable based on the
actuaries’ current estimates of complying with this new legislation at the relevant date.
The net pension liability comprises $19 million in respect of plans in surplus (2003: $17 million) and $380 million in respect of
plans in deficit (2003: $354 million).

Potential volatility of FRS 17
The method for calculating the net pension asset under FRS 17 would lead to volatility in the amount to be included in the balance
sheet. Pension plan liabilities are measured by reference to long term AA bond yields that can move substantially and rapidly
according to market conditions. The plans’ assets, which principally comprise equities, are also subject to large market swings. 
34 RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS
With effect from 1 June 2001, the cross-holding between Anglo American and De Beers was eliminated and Anglo American now
accounts for its 45% interest in DB Investments (DBI), the new holding company of De Beers Société Anonyme. As a result of 
De Beers’ partial interest in Debswana Diamond Company (Proprietary) Limited (one of the shareholders in DBI), Anglo American
accounted for an additional 3.65% of DBI’s post-tax equity earnings. As part of an agreement to extend a number of mining
licences, this partial interest has been ceded by De Beers to the Government of the Republic of Botswana. Following this
restructuring, Anglo American will account only for its direct 45% interest in DBI. Furthermore, Anglo American accounts for the
dividends attributable to 10% non-cumulative preference shares with a redemption value of $526 million in DBI as part of operating
profit, on the basis that the preference shares are part of Anglo American’s investment in the diamond business.
The Company and its subsidiaries, in the ordinary course of business, enter into various sales, purchase and service transactions
with joint ventures and associates and others in which the Group has a material interest. These transactions are under terms that 
are no less favourable than those arranged with third parties. These transactions, in total, are not considered to be significant.
Amounts owing to the Group by joint ventures are disclosed in note 18. Dividends received from joint ventures and associates
during the year totalled $408 million (2003: $426 million), as disclosed in the consolidated cash flow statement on page 49.

INTRODUCTION
The Ore Reserves and Mineral Resources estimates presented in this report are prepared in accordance with the Anglo American plc
(AA plc) Policy for the Reporting of Ore Reserves and Mineral Resources. This policy requires that the Australasian Code for
Reporting of Exploration Results, Mineral Resources and Ore Reserves 2004 edition (the JORC Code) be used as a minimum
standard. Some AA plc subsidiary companies have a primary listing in South Africa where public reporting is carried out according 
to the ‘South African Code for Reporting of Mineral Resources and Mineral Reserves’ (the SAMREC Code). The SAMREC Code is
similar to the JORC Code and the Ore Reserve and Mineral Resource terminology appearing in this section follows the definitions 
in both the JORC (2004) and SAMREC Codes.
The information on Ore Reserves and Mineral Resources was prepared by or under the supervision of Competent Persons as defined
in the JORC or SAMREC Codes. All Competent Persons have sufficient experience relevant to the style of mineralisation and type 
of deposit under consideration and to the activity which he/she is undertaking. All the Competent Persons consent to the inclusion 
in this report of the matters based on their information in the form and context in which it appears. The names of the Competent
Persons are lodged with the AA plc company secretaries in London and are available on request. 
Anglo American Group Companies are subject to a comprehensive programme of audits aimed at providing assurance in respect of
Ore Reserve and Mineral Resource estimates. The audits are conducted by people who qualify as Competent Persons from within 
a particular division, from another division of the Company or from independent consultants. The frequency and depth of the audits
is a function of the risks/uncertainties associated with the estimates of a particular Ore Reserve and Mineral Resource, the overall
value thereof and the time that has lapsed since an independent third party audit has been conducted. Those operations/projects
subject to recent independent, third party audits are indicated in footnotes to the tables.
The JORC and SAMREC Codes require the use of reasonable economic assumptions. These include long-range commodity price 
and exchange rate forecasts, which are prepared by in-house specialists largely using estimates of future supply and demand and
long-term economic outlooks. Ore Reserves are dynamic and are influenced by changing economic conditions, technical issues,
environmental regulations and additional information and therefore estimates can vary from year to year. Mineral Resource estimates
tend to be influenced mostly by additional information and transfers to Ore Reserves.
The estimates of Ore Reserves and Mineral Resources are as at 31 December 2004. Unless otherwise stated, Mineral Resources 
are additional to Ore Reserves. The figures in the tables have been rounded and, if used to derive totals and averages, could cause
minor computational differences.

(stated as at 31 December 2004). The Group’s Ore Reserve and Mineral Resource estimates were compiled in accordance with the
Australasian Code for Reporting of Mineral Resources and Ore Reserves (The JORC Code, 2004) as a minimum standard. Where
relevant, the estimates were also prepared in compliance with regional codes and requirements (e.g. The South African Code for
Reporting of Mineral Resources and Mineral Reserves, The SAMREC Code, 2000). The Mineral Resources are additional to the Ore
Reserves. 
The figures reported represent 100% of the Mineral Resources and Ore Reserves unless otherwise noted. AA plc’s interest in Anglo
Platinum is 74.84%.

(1)
4E PGE grade: sum of platinum, palladium, rhodium and gold grades in grammes per tonne.
(2)
The global tonnage and grade remain largely unaffected compared with 2003. The proved reserves increased by 28% (20Mt).
(3)
The decrease in the tonnage by 6% (37Mt) is partially due to the reallocation of reserves to resources and the narrower resource widths being modelled in the deeper areas at Union 
and Amandelbult sections.
(4)
Exploration results have generated improved confidence in the reserve. These results account for the substantial increase in Proved Ore Reserves. Finalisation of modelling of reserves 
in the PPL North project has had a major influence on grade estimates. Within the PPRust open pit, material lying between 1.0 g/t and 1.7 g/t will be stockpiled on surface and does not report 
to reserves. The Platreef is mined by open pit.
(5)
Tailings are reported separately as resources and reserves but are not aggregated to the global resource and reserve summation tabulations due to their significantly different 
characteristics and the calculation thereof.
(6)
Total Imperial units: tonnage is reported in million short tons (Mton), grade in troy ounces per short ton (oz/t) and contained metal in million troy ounces (Moz).
During 2004 the geostatistical processes of the South African operations and projects were reviewed by an external third party consulting firm.

(1)
4E PGE grade: sum of platinum, palladium, rhodium and gold grades in grammes per tonne.
(2)
The additional 7% (95Mt) of Merensky resources accrue from exploration results, refinement of modelling techniques, and the addition of various joint venture properties (where 
finalisation of agreements have been concluded) and other properties. Similarly the grade has been positively influenced by the 2004 exploration results.
(3)
The decrease in total UG2 resources by 4% (115Mt) between 2003 and 2004, is ascribed largely to the restatement of the Pandora JV following the conclusion of a joint venture. Anglo
Platinum’s attributable percentage changed from 100% to 42.5%. The balance of the variance is determined by dilution due to other joint ventures and exploration results. The measured and
indicated categories of resources have increased significantly.
(4)
Exploration results have allowed for a deepening of the resource envelope with a significant improvement in the lateral extent of the defined resources as well. This accounts for the substantial
increase in the measured resources. Finalisation of resources in the PPR North project has had a major influence in tonnage and grade estimates. Within the PPRust open pit, material lying between
1 g/t and 1.7 g/t, will be stockpiled on surface and reports to measured and indicated resources. The Platreef is mined by open pit.

AngloGold Ashanti reports Mineral Resources ‘as inclusive of those Mineral Resources modified to produce the Ore Reserve’ figures (JORC).
(2)
The large variance between the 2004 and 2003 figures is the result of economic scoping studies at WUDL, resulting in sub-economic areas being removed from the Mineral Resources.
(3)
The large variance between the 2004 and 2003 figures is due to the fact that AngloGold and Ashanti Goldfields each owned 50% of Geita Mine prior to the merger.

Trade Collieries refers to operations primarily associated with the production of coal for the world export market.
Power Generation Collieries refers to operations that primarily produce coal for domestic power generation requirements.
Other Coal Resources refers to project areas not included in the Trade Collieries or Power Generation Collieries, while Power Generation Collieries refers to operations that primarily produce coal 
for internal power generation requirements.
(1)
Reported and Attributable (%) refers to 2004 only. For the 2003 Reported and Attributable figures, please refer to the previous Annual Report.
(2)
Includes 100% of Coal Reserves and Coal Resources of consolidated entities and the Group’s share of joint ventures and associates where applicable. 
Where the Group’s share is more than 50%, 100% of the Coal Reserves and Coal Resources are reported.
(3)
Coal Reserves are quoted on a run of mine (ROM) reserve tonnage basis, which represents the tonnes delivered to the plant, and on a Saleable reserve tonnage basis, 
which represents the product tonnes produced.
(4)
Yield percentage represents the ratio of Saleable tonnes to ROM tonnes and is quoted on an in situ to in situ basis or on an air dried to air dried basis.
(5)
The coal quality is quoted as a weighted average of the heat content of all Saleable coal products. The coal quality for the Coal Resources is reported on an in situ basis.
(6)
Coal Resources are quoted on a mineable in situ (MTIS) tonnage basis in addition to the ROM reserves.
Coal quality parameters for Coal Reserves for trade collieries meet the contractual specifications for coking coal, metallurgical coal, steam coal and domestic coal.
Coal quality parameters for Coal Reserves for power generation collieries meet the specification of the individual supply contracts.
In Australia, the finalisation of the Dawson Project resources and reserve statement is reflected in a gain in Coal Reserves for the Trade Colliery Reserves (44 million ROM tonnes (51% basis)), 
a change in the Proved and Probable ratio and a reduction in the Trade Colliery Coal Resources and Other Coal Resources (28 million and 108 million MTIS tonnes respectively (51% basis)). 
The reporting of the Lake Lindsay Project Coal Resources reflects a gain of additional Coal Resources for the Trade Collieries (62 million MTIS tonnes (51% basis)).
In Colombia, the change in the Proved to Probable ratio in the Trade Colliery Coal Reserves and the gain of additional Trade Colliery Coal Resources (277 million MTIS tonnes (33% basis)) reflects 
the result of the upgrading of the resource estimate in response to geological drilling at Cerrejón.
In South Africa, the conversion of resources to reserves at Mafube Colliery is reflected in a reduction in Other Coal Resources (68 million MTIS tonnes) and the gain in the Power Generation Collieries
Coal Reserves and Coal Resources (14 million ROM tonnes and 20 million tonnes respectively (50% basis)).
In addition, 99.2 million saleable tonnes were depleted during 2004 by mining operations (reportable basis).
The geological models for the following operations and projects were audited during 2004 by third party, independent auditors: Kriel, Cerrejón, Zondagsfontein, Saddlers Creek and Theodore North.

(2)
Includes 100% of Ore Reserves and Mineral Resources of consolidated entities and the Group’s share of joint ventures and associates where applicable. Where the Group’s share is more than
50%, 100% of the Ore Reserves and Mineral Resources are reported.
(3)
Los Bronces Reserves include 29.7Mt @ 0.97%Cu sulphides (flotation) and 20.2Mt @ 0.48%Cu low grade sulphides (leaching) to be mined from a third party mining property (as an easement 
agreement). The agreement that gives Los Bronces the right to mine and process these Reserves was signed in November of 2003 (Acuerdo MARCO). Sulphide flotation Reserves contain 
0.015%Mo recovered as a by-product. The infill drilling carried out during the year resulted in an upgrade of Probable Reserves to Proved Reserves. The overall decrease in the sulphide flotation 
Reserves is due to a change in the cut-off grade which introduced changes in the geometry of the optimised pit.
(4)
El Soldado Oxide Resources and Reserves included in the mine plan amount to 1.3Mt @ 1.13%Cu.
(5)
Mantos Blancos – loss of more than 10Mt of sulphide Ore Reserves due to reduction in current life of mine. The life of mine is scheduled to end when the oxide plant runs out of material 
(leaving only the sulphide plant). The operation is not economic with just the sulphide plant producing. The remaining material is reported as Mineral Resource.
(6)
ICu = insoluble copper (total copper less acid soluble copper), ASCu = acid soluble copper, TCu = total copper.
(7)
Mantoverde – the dump leach Reserves have decreased due to depletion and transfer to heap leach Reserve as a result of a review of the marginal cut-off grade, and some material 
reclassified as Mineral Resource.
(8)
Collahuasi – only the attributable tonnage and metal tonnes (44%) are reported (in the AA plc 2003 Annual Report 100% was reported). Sulphide Reserves from Rosario deposit include 
1045Mt @ 0.026%Mo to be mined and processed as from 2006. Rosario low grade sulphide Reserves and all Ujina sulphides previously in the Proved category have been downgraded 
to Probable category due to uncertainties in long term modifying factors.
(9)
El Soldado sulphide Resources – near mine exploration has resulted in an increase in the Indicated Mineral Resources.
(10)
Mantos Blancos – the change in Resources is due to the transfer from Reserves to Resources and the lowering of the cut-off grade to the marginal cut-off value. For this year's additional 
Resources, dump leach mineralisation outside pits has been eliminated. This loss is offset by reporting vat leach material at a lower marginal cut-off grade.
(11)
Mantoverde – for this year's additional Resources, dump leach mineralisation outside pits has been eliminated. This loss is offset by reporting heap leach material at a lower marginal cut-off grade,
i.e. transfer of dump leach material to heap leach material.
The Ore Reserves and Mineral Resources of the following operations were audited during 2004 by third party, independent auditors: Mantoverde and Collahuasi.

Increase in Ore Reserves are mainly due to a change in cut-off grade policy. Mamatwan tonnages are stated as Wet Metric Tonnes, while Wessels is Dry Metric Tonnes.
(4)
Grades reported are beneficiated (washed samples) grades, as beneficiated grades are used in mine scheduling, quality control and blending (rather than in situ grades) and as such reflect a mineral
product grade. Yield cut-offs of 30% for massive manganese and 16% for loose pisolitic manganese are used in conjunction with lithology to further differentiate the ore/waste envelope.
(5)
The Ore Reserve grades and tonnages are reported after crushing, washing and screening. Some Probable Ore Reserves were transferred to Mineral Resources as they do not fall within
the current mining authorisation.
(6)
Hotazel Manganese Mines report Measured and Indicated Mineral Resources as ‘inclusive of those Mineral Resources modified to produce the Ore Reserve’ (JORC).
The increase in Mineral Resources is due to a lowering of the cut-off grade. Mamatwan tonnages are stated as Wet Metric Tonnes, while Wessels is Dry Metric Tonnes.
(7)
GEMCO report Measured and Indicated Mineral Resources as ‘inclusive of those Mineral Resources modified to produce the Ore Reserve’ (JORC).
(8)
The increase in Mineral Resources is due to the inclusion of underground resources after further investigation, and the transfer of Ore Reserves. A total of 58 million tons of resources are the subject
of old order unused rights as defined in the Mineral and Petroleum Resources Development Act and will expire with effect from 1 May 2005 and the decision was taken not to convert these rights.

the Ore Reserves. The Indicated Resources include Eluvial Chromite Resources. The 2004 Mineral Resource tonnage does not include 103Mt of low carbon Cr 2 O 3 material. 
The processing plant is optimised for high carbon Cr 2 O 3 . Currently it is not envisaged that ZAL will resume low carbon ferrochrome production.

Reported and Attributable (%) refers to 2004 only. For the 2003 Reported and Attributable figures, please refer to the previous Annual Report.
(2)
Includes 100% of Ore Reserves and Mineral Resources of consolidated entities and the Group’s share of joint ventures and associates where applicable. 
Where the Group’s share is more than 50%, 100% of the Ore Reserves and Mineral Resources are reported.
(3)
Status may change pending Kumba’s appeal regarding arbitration.
(4)
Leeuwpan’s Coal Reserves have increased by just over 18% as a result of an increase in yield made possible by changes in specifications required by clients.
(5)
Kumba reports mineral sands Ore Reserves as the percentage total heavy minerals (% THM) within the Ore Reserves. 
Individual valuable heavy mineral portions are reported as a percentage of the total heavy minerals (except Gravelotte Sand which reports the percentage ilmenite in the Ore Reserve tonnage).
Ilmenite is estimated with more confidence than rutile and zircon in some deposits, which is reflected in the classification.
(6)
Kumba Resources report Mineral Resources ‘as inclusive of those Mineral Resources modified to produce the Ore Reserve’.
(7)
Increase is due to positive exploration drilling results, which led to the updating of Mineral Resource estimates.
(8)
The change in estimated Mineral Resources is the result of additional drilling and subsequent orebody boundary revision.
(9)
Braeburn and Fairbreeze C extension Mineral Resources subject to successful prospecting rights conversion.
(10)
Prospecting rights on the KwaZulu deposits (Red Scar, Anmatikulu and Red Hill) have been relinquished due to disappointing exploration results.
(11)
Plant fines from the production of metallurgical dolomite are sold as aggregate.
The ore reserves and mineral resources of the following operations were audited during 2004 by third party, independent auditors: Sishen and Inyanda.

INDUSTRIAL MINERALS
(stated as at 31 December 2004). The Group’s Ore Reserve and Mineral Resource estimates were compiled in accordance with 
the Australasian Code for Reporting of Mineral Resources and Ore Reserves (The JORC Code, 2004) as a minimum standard. 
Where relevant, the estimates were also prepared in compliance with regional codes and requirements (e.g. The South African Code
for Reporting of Mineral Resources and Mineral Reserves, The SAMREC Code, 2000). The Mineral Resources are additional to the 
Ore Reserves, unless otherwise stated.

Rounding of figures may cause computational discrepancies.
(1)
Reported and Attributable (%) – no change between 2003 and 2004.
(2)
The increase in Ore Reserves and additional Mineral Resources is due to a mining concession being granted for Area 5 during 2004 and the subsequent increase in the pit limits.
(3)
A drilling grid of 50m x 50m is now required to classify reserves as Proved (and resources as Measured). This has resulted in a reduction of the Proved Reserves but the total 
Proved plus Probable Reserves is not affected.

The comparative years have been restated to reflect the adoption of UITF abstract 38 ‘Accounting for ESOP trusts’.
(2)
1999, 2000 and 2001 have been restated for the adoption of FRS 19.
(3)
As first noted in 2002, operating profit for 2000 has been restated for the reclassification of the loss of $167 million arising on the anticipated disposal of Terra Industries Inc. The disposal did not
proceed and the loss has therefore been reclassified into operating exceptional items as an impairment.
(4)
2000 and 1999 have been restated to reflect the three-for-one bonus issue in May 2001.
(5)
EBITDA is operating profit before exceptional items plus depreciation and amortisation in subsidiaries and share of EBITDA of joint ventures and associates.
(6)
EBITDA interest cover is EBITDA divided by net interest expense, excluding other net financial income (2004: $119 million) and exceptional financing charges (2004: nil). EBITDA interest cover for
2002 is annualised to account for acquisitions during the year. The actual EBITDA interest cover for 2002 was 25.5 times. For 2000 and 1999 EBITDA interest cover is not applicable as the Group
was a net interest recipient after adjusting for other net financial income.
(7)
Total capital is the sum of shareholders’ funds, net debt and minority interests.
(8)
Return on capital employed is calculated as total operating profit before impairments for the year divided by the average total capital less other investments and adjusted for impairments.

COVER IMAGE
Rapidly industrialising and urbanising China is fuelling one 
of the greatest resource booms in history. Anglo American’s 
top-performing business units in 2004, Base and Ferrous Metals,
which are growing producers of copper and iron ore, benefited
from China’s burgeoning growth. The Group is also a leading
supplier into China of precious commodities such as platinum
group metals, diamonds and gold. 02 Anglo American plc Annual Review 2004
in Syktyvkar in Russia for five years before taking
control. This gradualist approach gives us a better feel
for the operating environment in new countries. 
Q
There was a controversy about Anglo’s
judgement of political risk in South Africa
– where do things now stand on this?
The problem was never our perception of political risk –
but those of some people in the international capital
markets. These concerns are largely the legacy 
of the leaking of an early draft of the Mining
Empowerment Charter in 2002. Confidence has 
been returning as this memory has receded and this
will be given momentum by the successful conversion
of ‘old order’ mineral rights. We remain committed 
to South Africa and are strongly supportive of the
agreed scorecard approach in the Mining Act and the
need to deliver on it – hence our big continuing
investment programme. To an extent I can share the
frustration of the South African government. It has
pursued exemplary macro-economic policies and
deserves to have been rewarded with more foreign
direct investment. 
Q
Anglo is used to thinking about physical
assets, finance and technology. Are you
as good at nurturing talent?
I would like to thank our employees for their
commitment in 2004. During my site visits and at the
centre I have been impressed by the calibre of Anglo’s
people. I like the fact that we typically entrust most
senior operational posts to locally recruited managers.
We have become much more strategic and proactive
in creating a performance-driven culture, career and
talent management, addressing shortcomings in our
engagement with employees and in moving to a 
more diverse workforce. We have been better at the
traditional ‘hard’ skills, but the board has identified
‘people’ issues as a strategic priority and we are now
definitely moving in the right direction.
Q
While the financial performance for
2004 was good, do you feel that 
enough was done to strengthen the
fundamentals of the business?
Y es. Our earnings were strong but this was not purely a
function of commodity prices. They reflect, for example,
the value adding nature of the acquisitions made over
the last four years – especially Minera Sur Andes,
Syktyvkar, Cerrejón – and the De Beers transaction.
These have produced a stronger and more balanced
portfolio. Who, in the past, would have predicted the
pre-eminence of Latin America in our 2004 earnings?
Nor, in a year of ‘plenty’, have we rested on our
laurels. We have realised a further $554 million in cost
savings. Through the merger with Ashanti Goldfields,
AngloGold’s resource base and growth prospects have
been strengthened. Reorganisations within Anglo
Platinum and Paper and Packaging have been carried
out. We launched a drive to encourage innovation and
greater entrepreneurialism. The fundamentals of the
business are stronger than they were 12 months ago. 
Q
Many of the opportunities which Anglo
is examining are in ‘new geographies’.
Do you think you are properly equipped
to manage the risks involved?
Actually, we have a strong project pipeline in very
familiar regions – southern Africa, South America,
eastern Europe and Australia. We are also looking 
at new geographies, chiefly China, Russia and India,
since each has the potential to be a major growth
market as well as a significant commodities producer.
Our approach has been to become involved, initially
in a relatively limited way, while we seek better 
to understand the risks of doing business in each. 
The board is very supportive of this and believes it is
one of Anglo’s strengths. When I went to China, for
example, I visited small Anglo businesses in quarrying
and drilling equipment and was briefed on three other
potential opportunities. Similarly, we held a stake 
QUESTIONS 
AND ANSWERS 
SIR MARK MOODY-STUART 
CHAIRMAN Anglo American plc Annual Review 2004 03
Q
Were there any major disappointments
in 2004 – if so, how do you intend to
rectify them? 
The increase in fatalities at our managed operations
from 44 to 49 was of course a major disappointment.
There was a welcome further improvement in the lost
time injury frequency rate of 23%, but we are not
prepared to be philosophical about the death of any
employee or contractor. There is already an emphasis
on improving safety at all sites, but it is evidently not
enough. Thus, we must continue to emphasise visible
felt leadership in the field of safety, focus on safety
for contractors – who made up over half the 2004
fatalities – and seek to focus on leading indicators
such as ‘near hits’ and tackling unsafe behaviour. 
We have made good progress over the last four 
years and we will do our utmost to return to the 
path of improvement. 
Q
What changes are planned in the
composition of the board? 
Bill Nairn, our technical director, retired from 
the board at the end of 2004. I am grateful for 
the experience that he brought to the Group 
and especially his relentless focus on safety. 
At the AGM, two non-executive directors will 
be retiring: Sir David Scholey and Göran Lindahl. 
Sir David steps down after a long association with 
the Anglo Group, including serving as a director 
since December 1999. Göran has brought his 
wide international experience and knowledge 
of sustainable development to our deliberations. 
We shall miss them.
One new independent non-executive director, 
Ralph Alexander, will be proposed at the AGM. 
He is an American citizen and is chief executive 
of BP Petrochemicals. He brings extensive experience
of the energy business and has a strong international
background. Two new executive directors will also 
be proposed: David Hathorn and Simon Thompson,
respectively chief executives of the Paper and
Packaging and Base Metals businesses. Both have
played a major part in the international expansion of
the Group. In addition, it is proposed that René Médori
be elected a director with effect from 1 June 2005.
René, a French national, who has extensive experience
of UK and US business cultures, will be joining us
from The BOC Group plc, where he is finance director.
He will succeed Tony Lea as finance director in
September and Tony will leave the board in December.
In relation to the Combined Code requirement 
to ‘comply or explain’ I should mention that we 
will briefly be non-compliant in that from June to
December less than half the board, excluding myself,
will be independent non-executive directors. I believe
that this is fully justified in ensuring continuity and 
a smooth handover between Tony and René. 
Q
What do you see as the non-financial
highlights of 2004?
I would highlight four. First, Anglo became a signatory 
to the UN Global Compact – the ten principles of which
we fully support – and made all the preparations to
become a party to the Voluntary Principles on Security
and Human Rights. Secondly, our work on HIV/AIDS
continued to progress, with some 2,200 employees
now on anti-retrovirals and an improved uptake of
voluntary counselling and testing. Thirdly, our innovative
Socio-Economic Assessment T oolbox process had 
an enthusiastic take-up at site level, with some 30
assessments already under way. Fourthly, we reorganised
how we bring the strands of sustainable development
together and instituted a project to improve our
calibration of sustainable development risk. The benefits
of these changes will come through during 2005. 
Q
Y ou are closely identified with
‘sustainable development’ and ‘corporate
responsibility’ – how would you answer
those who say it is a peripheral issue or,
as in the recent Economist article, that
business should just concentrate on profits
for shareholders?
Sustainable development is absolutely central to the
future acceptability of our business and to its ongoing
success and profitability. Our businesses have high
environmental and social impacts, many deplete a
non-renewable (albeit generally recyclable) resource,
and global concerns like climate change and HIV/AIDS
are highly relevant to us. These issues reflect upon
our licence to operate, our sustainability as an
investment, our ability to attract the most talented
recruits and our acceptability to governments and
communities. Moreover, our ability to understand 
and address societal concerns is fundamental to 
our good name and the value of that reputation. 
Q
Are you concerned that other
stakeholders, like governments 
and more assertive communities, 
want to increase their share of the
profits from your operations? 
Every enterprise faces tensions around how rewards
are shared – investors, employees, suppliers and
customers all want their ‘fair share’. In the natural
resources business there are more parties to the
process. For much of the last 30 years mining has
been a value destroyer for investors. Governments
tend to overlook the lean times when proposing new
or higher taxes in years like this. During 2005, Chile
and South Africa are both planning to decide upon 
a royalty regime. Such taxes have implications for
competitiveness, investment and employment. 
Some communities feel they get a raw deal when
fiscal benefits are often only felt at a national level.
We seek to improve the local development effects 
of our businesses but it is important too for national
governments to ensure that a proportion of tax
revenues is shared with local people.

Platinum group metals (PGMs)
do more to improve our quality
of life and clean up our
environment than simply
reducing vehicle exhaust
emissions. Their unique
physical and chemical
properties make them useful in areas as 
diverse as healthcare and waste reduction. 
Since the 1970s, autocatalysts containing PGMs 
have cut down the pollutants emitted by automobile
engines – carbon monoxide, hydrocarbons and oxides
of nitrogen. The use of PGMs in petroleum refining
has reduced the sulphur content in fuel and the need
for lead additives. 
There is now a strong drive to reduce emissions of
greenhouse gases, such as carbon dioxide, which 
are produced by the burning of fossil and wood fuels.
As that includes traditional electricity generation,
most auto manufacturers are no longer pursuing the
rechargeable electric car of the future. Instead, they
are developing fuel cells that use hydrogen and
oxygen, emission-free and in abundant supply. This
technology will harness PGMs to provide renewable,

sustainable and clean energy for transport, buildings
and the household.
PGMs are stronger and last longer than other 
metals, resisting corrosion and withstanding higher
temperatures. They produce more durable, lasting
products in which little of the metal is lost in use and
a large proportion is recoverable at the end of the
product’s life. That means less waste. Today, about
40% of autocatalyst PGMs are recycled from scrap.
This proportion would grow if legislation was passed
to ensure the collection of scrap from dealers.
These unusual and precious metals also have a role 
in the world of medicine. Platinum is used in catheters
and pacemakers on account of its purity, conductivity,
durability, biological compatibility and resistance to
corrosion. Cancer treatments containing platinum,
such as Cysplatin and Carboplatin, are stepping up 
the war against disease. 
PGMs have enhanced our quality of life by helping 
to clean up and preserve our environment. They will
continue to do so, playing a growing part in the
development of new technologies.   PRECIOUS

Platinum’s operations AngloGold Ashanti is becoming
more active in regions not
normally associated with gold
mining, like Laos, Mongolia 
and the Philippines. This is an
essential way of growing the
reserve base.
The global gold industry faces the likely persistence 
of a weak dollar, with stronger operating currencies
and a stable or improving gold price. New mine gold
production may decline from around 2008 onwards,
at least among Western producers, so staying
competitive will demand contained production costs
and a strong project pipeline.
The first response to these challenges will be to
deliver real, sustained value from existing operations.
That includes ensuring that the former Ashanti
Goldfields’ mines, long starved of working capital,
realise their reserve, margin and growth potential. 
Equally important is the drive to expand AngloGold
Ashanti’s reserve and resource base to ensure
continued growth over the next decade. To do this,
the company has established a ‘new business’ team
that seeks out partnerships with junior exploration
and mining companies in regions outside the world’s
mainstream mining areas. 
In these partnerships, AngloGold Ashanti has the right
to convert its minority stake into a majority holding 
if and when a project reveals the potential to become
a large deposit.  
Over the past year the company has diversified in 
this way into regions such as Laos, Mongolia and 
the Philippines.   AN EXPANDING
INVESTMENT 
SPREADING FRONTIERS
While The Diamond T rading Company (DTC) sorts,
values and then sells rough gemstones, it is also
responsible for driving consumer demand for
diamonds around the world. Every now and 
then one of its regional marketing initiatives 
fires the public imagination so successfully 
that it is then rolled out in other parts of the
globe. The ‘T rilogy’ concept is one of these.
‘Trilogy’ was originally conceived in 2000 for
implementation in the US, a huge market which
accounts for half of all diamond jewellery sales
throughout the world. The underlying idea is 
‘three-stone jewellery’ , with each stone representing
the past, present and future of a couple’s relationship.
A $20 million marketing campaign, using press, 
TV, magazines and outdoor posters was launched
across the country. 
It was an immediate hit. The results were so
encouraging that the DTC has since exported the
concept to Europe, where the ‘Trilogy’ campaign has
been adapted for use in the UK, France and Italy.
Most recently, the campaign has been redrawn for
Japan, where it has led to a resurgence of interest in
diamond jewellery in what is the world’s second most
important diamond market.
After some years of lagging behind in the market 
for luxury goods, diamonds are once again competing
successfully. Retail diamond sales around the world
passed the $60 billion mark for the first time in
2004. It is expected that nearly $6 billion of that 
was for ‘Trilogy’ products – 10%, in other words, 
of the total retail market for diamond jewellery.
Campaigns such as these will help De Beers achieve
its strategic goal of growing global demand for
diamond jewellery by 50% over the next ten years.   Left: In recent years,

Anglo American plc Annual Review 2004 05 06 Anglo American plc Annual Review 2004
In 2003, Anglo American acquired a controlling
interest in Kumba, one of the world’s leading
iron ore producers. The acquisition has opened
up an exciting new area of business, with
significant growth potential.
Demand for iron ore by the world’s steel markets
remains strong, driven chiefly by sustained offtake
from China. Chinese imports absorbed almost 25% 
of global iron ore production in 2004. That could 
grow to 50% over the next 20 years, with much 
of the increase translating directly into growth 
in world demand. 
In order to take advantage of escalating iron ore
demand, Kumba has a vigorous expansion programme
in place. In South Africa, it aims to lift Northern Cape
iron ore production from 27 million tonnes per annum
to 46 million tonnes per annum over the next ten
years, principally from the Sishen Expansion and
Sishen South projects. Elsewhere in Africa, a pre-
feasibility study on the high-grade Faleme iron ore
deposit in Senegal is expected to be completed in 
the coming year.   An entirely new process for extracting zinc 
from basic ore has been developed and put into
commercial operation by Anglo Base Metals at
its Skorpion zinc mine in southern Namibia.
The remote Skorpion deposit is made up of an
unusual combination of zinc oxide minerals, which 
do not lend themselves to extraction by conventional
technology. For Anglo Base Metals to exploit the
deposit’s commercial potential, an alternative form 
of processing had to be found. 
New technology was developed, over an eight-year
period, in partnership with Reunion Mining
(subsequently acquired by Anglo American) and
Spain’s Técnicas Reunidas. It required the integration
of new leaching and neutralisation techniques with a
customised solvent extraction purification process.

the country. Certain other markets, such as the UK,
are more inclined to use asphalt in installations like
car parks. Poland’s severe winters make concrete,
with better resistance to frost and salt, a more
popular choice.
Car parks and shopping centres are typical users 
of concrete paving, but Polish customers range from
road-builders – who use it for peripheral surfaces 
– to individual homeowners.   LIGHTING UP THE WORLD

almost to zero, they also open the way to 
viable hydrogen-based energy – including fuel 
cell technology.
Anglo American plays an important role in this
greening of coal. Anglo Coal’s Roger Wicks serves 
as chairman of the World Coal Institute, which 
has steered much of the debate and subsequent
response. The company itself is engaged in various
collaborative cleaner-coal projects, including one 
in Victoria, Australia, that will convert coal into 
gas and diesel.   As energy demand and prices
continue to rise, coal remains the
world’s most abundant, affordable
and secure fuel source. With the
help of technology, it is also
becoming a cleaner fuel.
Higher prices have moderated the ‘dash for gas’
among some electricity generators and new coal-fired
power stations are proliferating, particularly in 
Asia and the US. Coal produces nearly 40% of 
the world’s electricity. It fuels 70% of global steel
production and is key to other basic industries, 
such as cement manufacture.
Over the next 30 years, world energy demand will
grow by 60%, according to the International Energy
Agency, which believes that fossil fuels will supply
85% of that increase. Developing economies like
China and India will create much of this additional
demand. Their new power stations are mostly 
coal-based, with higher efficiencies and lower
emissions than many plants in the developed world. 
Because they use less fuel, ‘supercritical’ power
plants produce correspondingly fewer harmful
emissions. While new combustion and gasification
techniques will eventually reduce emission levels

CONSTRUCTION
As the Polish economy continues to develop,
Tarmac’s local quarrying operations have
benefited from public spending on road and rail

of private construction.
Like consumers elsewhere in central and eastern
Europe, Poles are becoming more affluent. So new

While the architects originally specified natural stone
for the external paving, they were persuaded that
premium concrete pavers could achieve similar
functional and aesthetic standards.

MINERALS PAPER AND

08 Anglo American plc Annual Review 2004
PAPER AND
PA CKA GING
Innovation plays a role in all Group businesses
in one form or another but nowhere more so
than in Paper and Packaging. The stream of 
new products from this division invariably
offers novel advantages for a specific client
group, or more generic energy-saving and
environmental benefits.
A compelling example is Mondi Packaging’s ONE
Sack, a new one-ply bag for powdered goods of all
types – particularly cement. Large paper bags have
traditionally been made from two, sometimes three,
layers of paper, depending on the weight of the 
goods being packaged. The ONE sack uses one, 
but with the strength and stiffness needed to deliver
top performance.
ONE sack is easily filled, loaded on pallets and stored.
Because it consumes less resources it reduces
packaging costs and is cheaper to transport and
dispose. Customers have been quick to appreciate
these advantages. In Austria, for example, virtually
the entire cement industry has switched over to 
ONE sacks.
Mondi Packaging Coating’s new Direct Lidding
technology also improves on the system it replaces,
while being more environmentally friendly. Glass jars
normally have to be chemically pre-treated before
they are sealed. Direct Lidding allows a secure seal 
to be placed directly on chemically untreated glass or
plastic. The process is easier, more cost-competitive
and, because fewer chemicals are needed, kinder to
the environment. 
INSULAID® multilayer facings, used in foam
insulation products, are another advanced product
from Mondi Packaging Coating. Due to the diffusion
tightness of the facings, these allow the fabrication
of very thin panels with excellent insulation values.
Drastic reduction in energy consumption can be
achieved in accordance with the Kyoto Protocol.
Innovation of a different kind is represented by the
neoSteam™ pouch from Mondi Packaging Flexibles,
which is ‘revolutionary active packaging for
microwave steaming’. The revolution lies in a new
steam valve that can withstand high temperatures,
and allows the contents to steam-cook instead of
boiling. The result is shorter cooking times and
maximum retention of flavour and texture.
As electronic components get faster and smaller, 
they become sensitive to interference damage from
external energy sources. They must be protected
during manufacture, storage and transport or their
performance may be affected. Mondi Packaging
Coating has perfected a form of corrugated board
packaging by offering an Electro Static Discharge liner
– Parastat – which creates a high level of shielding
and dissipates any charge along the packaging
surface. It also offers physical and moisture
protection – and is fully recyclable.   PACKAGED GOODS

NEW IDEAS
Innovation is one of our most 
precious natural resources
Anglo American is renowned for its formidable 
in-house technical capacity. The Anglo T echnical
Division (A TD) and Anglo American Research
Laboratories are a powerful multi-disciplinary
resource enabling Anglo American to operate 
at the forefront of innovation.
Their work enhances the value of the Group’s mining,
metallurgical and industrial businesses and assists
with exploration activities and the management of
mineral reserves and resources. Important areas of
social responsibility like environmental stewardship,
safety and industrial health have all benefited from
their contributions. 
Anglo American strongly encourages the sharing 
of best practice. A good example is the collaborative
development of one of the world’s longest single-drop
rope-hoisting systems to raise ore from ultra-deep
levels. This drew together AngloGold Ashanti, ATD
and Scaw Metals, the Ferrous Metals and Industries
subsidiary that manufactured the rope.
Current research initiatives include how to leach 
gold without using cyanide, new hydrometallurgical
approaches to base metals recovery, and the use 
of microwaves in solid-state reduction processes.
Other work concentrates on combining biological 
and electrochemical processes in water purification
and how to monitor stope stability in open pits.
In exploration, Anglo American carries out significant
research and development in the areas of cryogenic
electromagnetic technology, airborne gravity
gradiometry, radio frequency and radar applications.
An important role was played in the development 
of the super-conducting quantum interference device
(SQUID), which measures minute changes in the
earth’s magnetic field. This offers considerable
advantages over competing systems in finding 
certain buried targets, such as nickel sulphides. 
At the leading edge, Anglo American monitors
developments in nanotechnology, the science of
extremely small particles. Nanotechnology allows
production of new materials with physical and
chemical properties that would not have been 
possible using conventional methods. One application
could be the use of ruthenium, a platinum group metal,
in thin-film photovoltaic cells. Another might see zinc
oxide being used in flat-panel electronic displays.
Promoting innovation is now a strategic business
imperative. Mondi’s internet-based Innovation Zone,
for example, allows employees around the world 
to share ideas about cost savings and market
opportunities. Indeed, all business units have
programmes in place to achieve these goals. Anglo
American has also developed a formal technology
management process. This was pilot-tested in a
recent Group-wide exercise to identify energy
conservation opportunities. A subsequent report
highlighted consumption and conservation targets 
and identified energy generation opportunities. 
One result is a commitment to design in energy-
saving measures at an early stage of new projects.   BREAKING DOWN THE SILOS
GROUP-WIDE KNOWLEDGE SHARING IS ESSENTIAL
Below: The Anglo American Group has a long tradition of research
and technical innovation – often developing ideas in-house and
carrying them right through to commercial application. 
RESEARCH &
DEVELOPMENT 10 Anglo American plc Annual Review 2004
One of the dominant features of 2004 was the
increased demand for a range of commodities as
China’s industrialising economy continued to consume
more raw materials. Copper, nickel, zinc, coal and iron
ore markets all benefited materially and a number 
of these commodities reached their highest price levels
for many years. As a result of these strong conditions,
as well as rising platinum, gold and diamond prices,
Anglo American reported record headline earnings 
of $2.69 billion and headline earnings per share
increased by 57% to $1.88 per share. 
Nonetheless, the year was dominated by two major
influences – volatile global markets, largely because 
of the uncertain outlook in the Middle East; and the
possibility of a marked slowdown in China’s economic
growth rate. During the second, and again in the fourth
quarter of the year, markets grew concerned that
official Chinese attempts to slow down excessive
investment and growth would result in a ‘hard landing’.
During each of these periods, metals prices responded
by dropping sharply and then rebounding fairly quickly.
Chinese GDP growth is now projected to average
around 8% for 2005. 
In line with the board’s policy of progressively
increasing dividends, the board has decided to
increase the final dividend by 12 cents to 51 cents
per share, resulting in a total dividend of 70 cents 
per share for 2004, up 30%.
STRATEGY
Since our primary London listing in mid-1999, Anglo
American has grown by over 70%, with a present
market capitalisation now approaching $38 billion.
Our strong cash generation has been matched by one
of the largest capital expenditure programmes in the
industry. Our existing $4.7 billion project pipeline 
and more than $8 billion in unapproved projects,
spread across all our business units and geographies,
provide an excellent platform for growth going
forward. We will continue to enhance and add value
to Anglo’s portfolio of world-class assets in all areas;
in particular, through:

Our strategy for future investment remains focused

namely Precious Commodities, Metals and Minerals
and Paper and Packaging.
ACQUISITIONS AND ORGANIC GROWTH
Although Anglo American remains cautious about
valuations at this point in the cycle, the Group
continues to examine expansion and acquisition
opportunities in all its business sectors.
The following overview of our business units 
covers key developments; summaries of operating
performances are contained on pages 15 to 17 of 
this review.
Platinum
We are actively focusing on achieving further business
optimisation in Anglo Platinum. The strong level of the
South African rand continues to materially affect the
rate of expansion and also operating costs when
translated into US dollars. The projects that have
been earmarked for development will continue to be
reviewed in light of the strong rand. 
Despite the loss of production due to industrial action
during October, arising out of wage negotiations,
Anglo Platinum achieved its 2004 target of producing
2.45 million ounces of refined platinum. The company
recently established a co-operative joint venture
contract with Sichuan Mineral Resource Company 
to conduct exploration for platinum group metals 
in China's Sichuan Province.
Gold
One of the most significant transactions of the year
was the merger of AngloGold and Ashanti Goldfields,
which was completed in April. The merger has resulted
in a substantial increase in gold reserves against 
a background of a diminishing global reserve base.
AngloGold Ashanti continues to pursue further growth
opportunities in new frontiers such as Laos, the
Philippines and Russia, in partnership with junior
mining and exploration companies. AngloGold Ashanti,
in which Anglo American holds a 51% stake, is the
world’s second largest gold mining company in terms
of production. 
Diamonds
De Beers’ strategy of Supplier of Choice, which
focuses on driving demand in the diamond industry,
continues to be implemented successfully. Central 
to this has been the realignment of De Beers’
relationship with its sightholders, a process that is
now substantially complete and that has brought
about considerable benefits for De Beers and the
diamond industry as a whole. De Beers’ $180 million
a year advertising and marketing spend has been
significantly bolstered by an increase in advertising
programmes by sightholders and their downstream
trade partners. Following years of underperformance
in terms of market share, diamonds are now competing
successfully with other luxury goods. At the retail level,
sales of diamonds worldwide exceeded $60 billion 
for the first time.
An important breakthrough took place in July when 
De Beers announced that it had reached a settlement
with the US Department of Justice for the resolution
of a longstanding case against De Beers in respect 
of industrial diamonds. The resolution of the case
underscores the company’s commitment to be fully
legally compliant throughout the world.
In December, De Beers announced that it had secured
a 25 year renewal of all four mining leases in Botswana,
on a coterminous basis. De Beers and the European
Commission are in the final stages of a constructive
dialogue to address the Commission’s concerns over
aspects of the five year trade agreement between 
De Beers and Russian diamond producer Alrosa. 
Base Metals
On the back of high base metals prices and record
production of copper, nickel, zinc and mineral sands
products, Base Metals achieved record headline
earnings of just over $1 billion. The acquisition of
Minera Sur Andes was a major contributor to this
performance with headline earnings of $430 million.
A significant achievement during the year was the
Skorpion zinc mine in Namibia commencing commercial
production in May and achieving 95% of design
capacity by year end. Commissioning of the
$654 million Collahuasi Rosario Project in Chile
commenced in April, some five weeks ahead of
schedule and under budget. The project rapidly
achieved design capacity and will enable Collahuasi to
maintain production of copper in concentrate at a long
term average rate of 400,000 tonnes per annum. 
Codemin, in Brazil, became a wholly-owned subsidiary
following the purchase of the remaining 10% from the
International Finance Corporation, and the expansion
project was completed on time and on budget and will
ramp up to full capacity during the first quarter of
2005. In line with Base Metals’ strategy of focusing
on fewer, larger, lower cost assets, its 25% stake 
in Nkomati Nickel was disposed of in February for 
$37 million and Hudson Bay in Canada was sold 
for $257 million.

Industrial Minerals
In the UK, Anglo Industrial Minerals’ new cement plant
at Buxton commenced operating in March and is ramping
up to full capacity of 800,000 tonnes per annum. 
The project cost of £110 million was £5 million below
budget. In China, the Y ang Quarry, situated 140
kilometres from Shanghai and the closest reserve of
top-quality asphalt aggregates to China’s commercial
capital, commenced production at the end of the year.
Production will be ramped up during 2005. Following
completion of the Goiás project in 2003, Copebrás
almost doubled its contribution on the back of buoyant
Brazilian fertiliser markets. 
Ferrous Metals and Industries
With global steel production surpassing 1 billion tonnes
for the first time, the contribution from Ferrous Metals
and Industries’ operations increased more than
fourfold. Regarding Kumba’s Hope Downs iron ore
project in Australia, which has been the subject of 
a dispute with a local partner, Kumba is appealing a
recent arbitration decision. Subject to Kumba’s rights
of appeal, the process for determining a fair value, at
which the local partner can elect to acquire Kumba’s
project interest, has commenced. Until Kumba’s
participation in the project is finally resolved, it
continues to perform its contractual obligations in
respect of the project.
SAFETY AND SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT
It is with deep regret that we report the deaths of 
28 contractors and 21 employees in accidents at 
our operations during the year. This represented 
an increase of five deaths compared with 2003,
following four years of consistent decline. Such
accidents are wholly unacceptable and we will be
redoubling our efforts to eliminate them. It was
encouraging, however, that the lost time injury
frequency rate improved by 23% – which indicates
success in embedding safer behaviour at site level.
We have made significant progress in addressing the
sustainable development agenda, including launching
our Socio-Economic Assessment Toolbox, making
strides in improving local business development 
and initiating a pilot sustainable development risk
management process.
Coal
In December, Anglo American and Mitsui announced
the approval of the $653 million Dawson Complex,
which will include the recapitalisation of the existing
operation at Moura in central Queensland, Australia,
and the establishment of two additional operations 
on adjacent tenures. This will increase production by 
5.7 million tonnes per annum over Moura’s existing
saleable production of 7 million tonnes per annum. 
In October, Anglo American and Kumba signed Heads
of Agreement that could lead to the development of 
a major coking coal mine in central Queensland.
In August, Anglo Coal and Eyesizwe announced 
that they were entering into a 50:50 joint venture 
to mine the Arnot North coal reserves, known as
Mafube Colliery, and mining has commenced. A new
opencast operation, the Isibonelo Colliery, is being
developed to provide Sasol with 5 million tonnes 
of coal per annum. Production is due to commence 
in mid-2005. Anglo Coal and BHP Billiton are jointly
investigating the proposed expansion of coal
resources in the Western Complex in South Africa.
In Colombia, the approved expansion at Cerrejón 
from 22 million to 28 million tonnes per annum 
is on schedule and should be achieved by 2007.
Paper and Packaging
In April, Anglo American’s wholly-owned subsidiary
Mondi acquired the remaining 30% interest in
Frantschach for a total consideration of $390 million.
The acquisitions of Copamex’s industrial packaging
businesses (renamed Mondimex) and Roman
Bauernfeind were completed in the first quarter of
2004 and are performing according to expectations,
having strengthened Mondi’s position in the North
American and central European markets respectively.
In November, Mondi announced a major restructuring
focused on global product lines, namely Mondi Business
Paper and Mondi Packaging. The reorganisation has
streamlined and rebranded the existing businesses
under the Mondi name, allowing the group to improve its
visibility to customers and to reduce its overhead costs.

SOUTH AFRICA: 
BLACK ECONOMIC EMPOWERMENT
During the year several developments took place
concerning the legislative framework governing the
transformation process in South Africa’s mining
industry. Most notably, the Mineral and Petroleum
Resources Development Act, which aims to make
transformation effective across a broad front – including
human resources and community development, as well
as employment equity – came into effect on 1 May
2004. All South African mining operations are focused
on the implementation of this Act. Anglo American has
submitted a number of applications to convert ‘old
order’ mineral rights into ‘new order’ rights. The Group
hopes to be able to report progress in this regard later
in the year.
During the year the South African government confirmed
that royalties in terms of the Royalty Bill will become
payable only in 2009; a second draft of the Royalty Bill 
is expected to be unveiled in the future.
We have adopted a comprehensive approach to
transformation in South Africa, including the
establishment of a Transformation Committee, 
which has been integrated with all the business units’
activities. Procurement remains an important area 
of focus: over the last year we spent the equivalent 
of $900 million on business development and the
procurement of goods and services from black-owned
businesses, up 62% on the previous year. 
Mondi South Africa concluded two significant
empowerment transactions during 2004. First, 
in June, a joint venture was formed with Shanduka
Resources (formerly MCI Resources) in its integrated
newsprint business, with Mondi retaining a 58%
interest and, secondly, Mondi disposed of 42% of 
its $370 million South African packaging businesses
to Shanduka, effective 1 January 2005. These
empowerment transactions allowed for further 
interests in the newsprint and packaging businesses
to be set aside for broad based participation by Mondi
South Africa employees and relevant communities.
DISPOSALS
During 2004 a number of disposals were made. These
included Anglo American’s 20% stake in Gold Fields
Limited for $1.18 billion, the remaining interest in
FirstRand Limited for $47 million and the Group’s 
49% stake in Terra Industries Inc for $255 million. 
In line with Base Metals’ strategy of focusing on
fewer, larger, lower cost assets, its 25% stake in
Nkomati Nickel was disposed of in February for 
$37 million and Hudson Bay in Canada was sold for
$257 million in December. Anglo American and BHP
Billiton have recently announced the sale of their
respective 40% and 60% shareholdings in Samancor
Chrome for an enterprise value of $469 million. The
sale will be effective 1 April 2005, subject to
obtaining regulatory approvals.
OUTLOOK
The outlook for the year ahead is very dependent
upon growth prospects for Organisation for Economic
Co-operation and Development (OECD) countries 
and China. While the leading indicators for the OECD
currently point to some slowing of industrial output,
China continues to grow strongly and will remain a
vital market for many of our commodities. On the
supply side, global output is generally set to increase
and much will depend on the industry maintaining
capital discipline in the face of higher commodity
prices. A key challenge for the Group will be to
continue improving operating efficiencies and cost
control against a background of volatile currencies
and, in particular, a weak US dollar. In the meantime,
Anglo American’s geographic and commodity diversity,
its significant project pipeline, its disciplined acquisition
process and strong cash generation will continue 
to underpin performance. 
OUR EMPLOYEES
At the end of 2004, Bill Nairn retired as technical
director. I would like to thank Bill for his long and
dedicated service to the Group. He has been succeeded
as technical director by Tony Redman, who is also
chairman of Anglo Coal, and who has been appointed
to the Executive Board. In February 2005, we announced
the appointment of Lazarus Zim as chief executive
officer and Godfrey Gomwe as chief operating officer
of Anglo American Corporation of South Africa.
Lazarus will also chair the South Africa Transformation
Committee and has joined the Executive Board. Finally,

worldwide who, through their hard work and dedication,
have helped make this a record year for Anglo American.

Anglo Platinum’s operating profit
rose by 24% to $537 million, largely
due to improved prices and higher
sales volumes. The rise was partially
offset by a strong rand, which
increased costs in dollar terms.
The average price for all metals 
sold rose by 25.9% to $1,194 per
platinum ounce equivalent, due
mainly to higher platinum, rhodium
and nickel prices.
Improved smelting recoveries and
additional production from new operations
helped to increase refined platinum
production by 6% to 2.45 million ounces,
in spite of a two week strike in October.
The strike, safety stoppages and non-
achievement of certain efficiency targets
meant Anglo Platinum did not contain
costs as planned, but cost performance
has been encouraging and sustainable
improvements are being realised.
Anglo Platinum is confident that demand
for platinum will remain robust. However,
the continuing strength of the rand may
cause further delays in Anglo Platinum’s
extensive expansion programme.
The platinum price is expected to remain
firm during 2005, supported by strong
demand. The price of palladium will be
determined rather more by Russian supply
patterns, even though demand may
remain firm.
AngloGold Ashanti's operating profit
before exceptional items was 29%
lower at $263 million.
The average spot price was $409 
per ounce, compared with $363 in
2003. The strengthening of the rand
by some 15%, however, meant that
the South African gold price enjoyed
no benefit.
Gold production rose by 8%, to just over 
6 million ounces, reflecting the merger
with Ashanti Goldfields, and higher
production in Australia and the US. This
was offset by the sale of Jerritt Canyon 
in the US, the closure of Australia's 
Union Reefs and reduced South African
production. Cash costs rose by 25% to
$268 per ounce, mainly due to stronger
operating currencies and lower grades.
In addition to current growth projects 
that will maintain AngloGold Ashanti’s
production profile of some 6.5 million
ounces a year through to around 2012,
exploration and acquisition will grow the
reserve and resource base further, not
least in new regions such as Russia, 
Laos, the Philippines, Mongolia and
Central America.
Gold jewellery demand improved in the
Middle East, South East Asia and China
and was sustained in India. In 2005, 
much will depend on the dollar's fortunes,
with expectations that the gold price will
remain around present levels.
DIAMONDS
De Beers managing director: 
Gary Ralfe
Anglo American’s share of De Beers’
operating profit increased by 4%
over 2003 to $586 million.
Global retail sales of diamond
jewellery were about 6% higher than
the previous year in local currency
and, because of the continued
weakening of the dollar, about 8%
higher in dollars. Full year sales 
by The Diamond Trading Company,
the marketing arm of De Beers, were
$5,695 million, 3% higher than in
2003. Rough diamond prices rose 
by an average of 14%.
De Beers group diamond production,
including joint ventures in Botswana and
Namibia, was 47 million carats, 3 million
carats (7%) more than in 2003.
Debswana’s production rose by 2% to
over 31 million carats, a new record. 
At Namdeb, output grew by 28% to
nearly 1.9 million carats, including its
highest ever level of marine production.
The weakness of the dollar, the currency
in which diamonds are sold, has put 
De Beers’ older and more marginal mines
in South Africa under continued pressure. 
This year is likely to be more challenging
for the diamond industry. However, with
the industry transformation that has taken
place over the last few years, there is
growing evidence that diamonds are now
beginning to compete favourably with
other luxury products.

Ferrous Metals and Industries lifted
operating profit before exceptional
items by 330% to a record $895
million, with the help of improved
prices for iron ore, manganese,
ferrochrome, steel and vanadium.
Iron ore producer Kumba, with $205 million
operating profit before exceptional items,
benefited from an average 19% annual
increase in dollar prices from 1 April. Higher
output at Scaw Metals saw its operating
profit increase to $101 million. Samancor
enjoyed improved market conditions and
raised the attributable share of its operating
profit to $236 million. Highveld Steel had a
record year, with an operating profit of
$168 million, mainly due to higher prices
and increased South African sales volumes.
Improved product and contracting results 
in the Americas and Asia Pacific contributed
to Boart Longyear’s operating profit of 
$67 million.
In February 2005, Anglo American and 
BHP Billiton announced that they had
reached agreement for the sale of their
respective 40% and 60% shareholding 
in Samancor Chrome for an enterprise 
value of $469 million.
Ferrous metals prices may soften in the
coming year as Chinese demand for steel
slows, and the persistent strength of 
the rand will continue to affect margins. 
Ferrous Metals and Industries will continue to
reshape its portfolio around core businesses,
while it increases iron ore output and
improves margins through greater operating
efficiencies and cost savings.
FERROUS MET ALS 
AND INDUSTRIES
Business Unit head: 
Philip Baum
Anglo Base Metals raised operating
profits, before exceptional items, by
346% to $1,275 million on the back of
record production of copper, nickel,
zinc and mineral sands products 
and significantly higher base metals
prices. Strong demand growth and 
a weakening US currency propelled
base metals prices to multi-year highs.
The copper division’s operating 
profit before exceptional items was 
$1,046 million following record
attributable copper production and 
a higher average copper price. 
The nickel, niobium and mineral sands
division lifted operating profit to 
$224 million. Rutile and zircon production
grew by 16% and 28% respectively as
Namakwa Sands recovered from the 
after-effects of the mineral separation
plant fire in the second half of 2003.
The zinc division made an operating profit
before exceptional items of $38 million.
During the year, Skorpion mine entered
commercial production, achieving 95% of
design capacity by year end. In December,
Hudson Bay was sold for $257 million.
A weaker dollar and low metals inventories
should provide a solid support to dollar-
denominated prices. Nonetheless, some
base metals markets could move towards
balance or even into surplus in the second
half as price-induced supply increases
gather pace.
BASE MET ALS
Business Unit head: 
Simon Thompson
COAL
Business Unit head: 
John Wallington 
Anglo Coal's operating profit
increased by 46% to $487 million. 
The increase was due mainly to 
higher export prices and a 3%
increase in sales. 
Coal demand was strong during 2004
and prices increased markedly. Higher
prices and increased production at
most mines saw operating profit 
for South African-sourced coal rise 
by 83% to $244 million. 
Operating profit for the Australian
operations fell by 39% to $79 million,
mainly as a result of an eight month
interruption of production at Moranbah
North mine, following a major roof collapse.
Hedging reduced some of the adverse
effects of the stronger Australian dollar. 
Operating profit at the South American
operations rose by 134% to $164 million
on the back of significant price increases
and sales volume growth. Cerrejón
continues to expand its operations, and
feasibility studies on further expansions 
at Cerrejón and Carbones del Guasare 
are under way.
With Moranbah North back in operation,
improved production is expected in 
2005. Metallurgical coal prices have 
risen significantly again in negotiations
for 2005, and high prices for thermal
coals are expected to continue.

PAPER AND PACKAGING
Business Unit head: 
David Hathorn 
Operating profit was 15% lower 
at $559 million. This reflected 
a significantly tougher trading
environment, particularly in the
business paper sector, in spite 
of increased production and cost
savings. Dollar-reported results 
are improved by the translation
impact of the stronger euro and rand.
Mondi has restructured its operations
into two global product groups, Mondi
Packaging and Mondi Business Paper.
The balance of the group consists 
of the South African packaging
businesses, European paper merchant
Europapier, and the European and
South African newsprint businesses.
Mondi achieved $144 million in cost
savings and productivity improvements 
in 2004, offsetting lower prices to a 
large extent.
Mondi Packaging’s operating profit at 
$284 million was 6% below that of 2003.
The adverse impact of stagnant markets
was not fully offset by the positive impact
of substantial cost savings and profit
improvement initiatives achieved in 2004.
Mondi Business Paper’s operating profit 
of $209 million was 29% down on the
previous year, despite an increase in total
production volumes.
The outlook for paper and packaging prices
remains cautious. In 2005, Mondi will
continue to focus on product differentiation,
capitalising on the recent expansion
projects, innovation programmes and 
cost-reduction initiatives. 
The Group spent $120 million on
exploration in 2004 – $41 million 
on base metals, $9 million on coal, 
$14 million on ferrous metals, 
$43 million at AngloGold Ashanti 
and $13 million at Anglo Platinum. 
Anglo Base Metals concentrated on
brownfield exploration near its mines 
in Chile, Brazil, Ireland, South Africa 
and Namibia. Drilling identified additional
copper resources at El Soldado and
Los Bronces in Chile. Other copper
exploration took place in Mexico, Peru,
the Philippines and Brazil, while zinc
exploration focused on India and Australia.
Nickel exploration continued around the
West Raglan sulphide discovery in northern
Quebec as well as in Brazil and Finland. 
Anglo Coal's exploration stayed close to
existing operations in Australia, Colombia
and South Africa. Prospecting for coal-bed
methane took place in South Africa and
Australia, while the Xiwan project in
China’s Shaanxi province completed an
extensive initial drilling programme.
Anglo Ferrous Metals’ exploration 
activities all related to Kumba, with 
most expenditure incurred on greenfield
and brownfield iron ore exploration in
South Africa.
AngloGold Ashanti continued to explore
around its mines in Argentina, Australia,
Brazil, Ghana, Guinea, Mali, Namibia,
South Africa, Tanzania and the US. 
In Asia, the company has an exploration
team on the ground in Mongolia, where 
it is acquiring land positions in several
prospective areas, and has set up an
exploration office in China. It has also
established joint ventures in the Philippines
and Laos. In addition, its investment in
Trans-Siberian Gold provides opportunities
for further growth in Russia. Elsewhere,
AngloGold Ashanti is exploring in
prospective areas of Peru, Colombia and
Alaska and is establishing an exploration
base in the north east region of the
Democratic Republic of Congo.
Anglo Platinum’s efforts focused on
exploration in South Africa. Elsewhere, 
its partners carried out programmes in
Canada and Russia, while a joint venture
began to explore in the Sichuan province
of China. 
EXPLORATION
Operating profit before exceptional
items increased by 6% to $346
million. Tarmac’s operating profit
before exceptional items declined 
by 3% to $280 million due to
challenging market conditions in 
the UK, after the completion of
various large infrastructure projects
in 2003. France benefited from a
strong housing market, while the
Polish and Czech businesses
enjoyed better market conditions.
Operating profit in Spain improved
again, although weak market
conditions continued in Germany. 
The Middle East business enjoyed another
year of substantial growth and the 
Far East business continued to improve. 
Copebrás had an excellent year. Its
operating profit increased by 89% to 
$66 million due to continued strong
Brazilian demand for phosphate based
fertilisers and higher international prices. 
Market conditions in the UK are expected
to remain extremely competitive
throughout 2005. Tarmac’s performance
will be underpinned by continuing cost
reductions and initiatives to improve
customer service. The short term outlook
in Germany remains uncertain, while
elsewhere in continental Europe fair to
healthy market conditions are expected.
The local market for fertilisers in Brazil
remains buoyant, although there is
concern about lower international prices
for some agricultural commodities. The
new Goiás plant has augmented
Copebrás’ strong position in the market.

SUST AINABLE DEVELOPMENT
SKILLS, ENTHUSIASM AND COMMITMENT
SOCIAL INVESTMENT 
In 2004, Anglo American and its subsidiaries
contributed some $47.4 million, 1.1% of pre-tax
profit (2003: $38.3 million, 1.5% of pre-tax
profit) to charitable causes and social
investment, including staff time and gifts 
in kind. Major causes supported included
community development (38%) and education
and youth (26%). 
In the United Kingdom, key causes supported included
higher education, international development charities
(e.g. SightSavers, Care, Leonard Cheshire,
Transparency International and Engineers without
Borders) and environmental initiatives. In South
Africa, the Anglo American Chairman's Fund
continued to be well regarded for the quality of its
programmes, especially in the fields of education 
and HIV/AIDS. In particular, Anglo American has 
been pursuing a Community HIV/AIDS Partnership
aimed at raising awareness amongst young people
and at helping improve public health services in
community clinics at selected locations.
At site level, Anglo American operations continued 
to work closely with local communities on issues 
such as the provision of a new primary health clinic 
at Rosh Pinah (Skorpion mine, Namibia), building
capacities amongst local farmers (Chagres smelter,
Chile), facilitating community access to water 
(Anglo Platinum, Mokopane), supporting HIV
prevention programmes (Boart Longyear, China) 
and training programmes for disadvantaged young
people (Scaw Metals, South Africa).   OUR WIDER
RESPONSIBILITIES
CORPORATE
RESPONSIBILITY
During 2004 Anglo American pursued an active
programme to align the business more closely
with the objective of sustainable development. A
head of sustainable development was appointed
to bring together safety, health and environment,
product stewardship, HIV/AIDS and social issues. 
In September 2004, Anglo American was designated
as mining sector leader in the Dow Jones
Sustainability Index. In May, the Group received the
Global Business Coalition on HIV/AIDS Leadership
Award. Major developments during the year included:
joining the UN Global Compact and playing active
roles in the Extractive Industries Review and the
Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative;
launching the Anglo American Socio-Economic
Assessment Toolbox (SEAT);
piloting a unique Sustainable Development Risks
and Opportunities Assessment methodology;
launching a drive for greater energy efficiency; 
improving participation in HIV voluntary counselling
and testing. Almost 2,200 employees are now on
anti-retroviral treatment;
continuing our work to support grassroots black
economic empowerment, including through
procurement from companies run by historically
disadvantaged South Africans (which rose by 
over 60% compared with 2003) and small
business development. 
Right: Adding economic value to the
societies in which Anglo American
operates is central to the Group’s
approach to sustainable development.
This is not only through the process
of extracting or processing natural
resources but also through the
multiplier effects of wages and taxes,
payments to governments and
suppliers and returns to investors.

ENERGY 
CLIMA TE CHANGE
Anglo American’s operations are intensive
users of energy and major emitters of
greenhouse gases (GHGs). The prospect of
increasing energy prices and of the imposition
of regulatory costs on greenhouse gas
emissions therefore constitute both a major 
risk and a significant opportunity.
Using energy more efficiently is the first step in both
energy and emissions management. During 2004, the
Technical Division, with the Rocky Mountain Institute,
conducted an Energy Technology Pilot Project. This
underlined that many site-local cost-effective energy
efficiency options exist, including co-generation, heat
recovery, motor and pump replacement and improving
or eliminating the use of compressed air. Business
units are now working on engineering proposals for
the most attractive potential projects.
SOCIO-ECONOMIC
IMPACTS
ENERGY
Anglo American is also addressing GHG emissions
through the incorporation of cost of carbon estimates
into the appraisal of new investment proposals. 
The procedure aims to ensure that potential future
carbon costs and benefits are assessed so that
investment proposals recognise the likelihood of
these costs and benefits and to assess the financial
viability of alternative technologies and processes.
The Group is also seeking to reduce emissions at
existing operations. At Anglo Coal Australia, methane
is drained from some mines, obtaining credits from
the New South Wales GHG Abatement Scheme.
Other opportunities exist through the Clean
Development Mechanism (CDM), a Kyoto incentive 
to invest in emissions-reduction technology in
developing countries. To help identify CDM projects,
Anglo American has introduced a CDM Screening
Tool. Existing CDM projects continue to make
progress, including at Codemin in Brazil and, in 
South Africa, the Richards Bay paper plant and
Highveld's TransAlloys subsidiary.   SAFETY
SOCIO-ECONOMIC
IMPACTS IMPROVED 
At the end of 2003, the Anglo American Socio-
Economic Assessment Toolbox (SEAT) was
launched as a unique exercise in building
capacity at site level in the more effective
management of local social and economic
impacts. The SEAT process enables operations
to better understand their existing 'footprint';
suggests the most culturally appropriate 
means of engaging with relevant communities;
and then provides guidance on how to
implement improvements. Among the 22 tools
is guidance on best practice in local business
development, assessing human capital,
establishing partnerships, improving the quality
of community investment and in planning 
for the social dimension of mine closure.
The Toolbox was initially developed through three 
pilot projects at Anglo American operations. During
2004, almost 100 managers were trained in the
implementation of SEAT. Twelve assessments were
completed during 2004 in Chile, Venezuela, South
Africa and Zimbabwe. A further 22 are in train and 
are expected to have been completed during this year. 
At least 12 further assessments are already planned
for 2005. 
The SEAT Assessments are helping to build a greater
understanding of community needs, of potential
sources of friction or distrust, how core business
activities can be improved to maximise community
development and how our operations can partner 
with others to underpin sustainable livelihoods. 
During 2004, a parallel toolbox was developed to 
aid our exploration teams to improve their interactions
with the local communities where they work. This will
be tested in the field during 2005.   SAFETY ZERO TOLERANCE
T ARGET ZERO
Safety has been a clear priority for Anglo
American, especially since the Group adopted its
OTTO – zero tolerance target zero – programme.
Significant progress has been made in embedding
a safety culture and in reducing the level of
injuries at work.
In 2004, tragically, 21 employees and 28 contractors
died in accidents at Anglo’s managed operations – a
total of 49. This was an increase of five over 2003
and follows four years of consistent decline. There
was, however, a significant improvement in the lost
time injury frequency rate, which fell by 23% for the
year and by 71% over the last four years. 
Anglo American has an absolute commitment to the
elimination of injuries through initiatives like the
Safety Golden Rules, the Chief Executive's Safety
Award and emphasis on the importance of 'visible felt
leadership'. The Group is seeking to develop a culture
in which all its workforce work safely and also keep
an eye on their workmates to check that they too are
working safely. The Company intends to increase the
focus on safety standards and training, particularly
amongst contractors and on leading indicators such as
'near hits' as a means of pre-empting unsafe conduct.
The Group’s confidence that safety performance 
can be significantly improved through consistent
management focus and employee involvement is
reinforced by the experience of Tarmac. In 2004, 
its UK operations received the Quarry Products
Association premier safety award. 89% of Tarmac
operations had no lost time injuries (LTIs) during the
year. Across the Tarmac group there were 114 LTIs
for the year compared with 159 in 2003.   Further information on safety and sustainable development

SUMMARY DIRECTORS’ REPORT
FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2004
INTRODUCTION
The directors present to shareholders their summary financial
statements for the year ended 31 December 2004. The summary
financial statements do not constitute the statutory financial
statements as they do not contain sufficient information to allow
as full an understanding of the results of the Group and the state
of affairs of the Company or of the Group, and of its policies and
arrangements concerning directors’ remuneration, as is provided
by the full Annual Report.
The full financial statements, directors’ report and report 
of the auditors (which is unqualified) are included in a separate
document entitled Annual Report 2004, which is available to
shareholders free of charge. Shareholders who wish to obtain 
a copy for this and future years should contact the Company’s
Registrars, Lloyds TSB Registrars or the South African Transfer
Secretaries, Ultra Registrars, as appropriate. The full Annual
Report of Anglo American plc comprises the aforementioned
Annual Report 2004, this Annual Review and the booklet
containing the Notice of Annual General Meeting (AGM) 
and other shareholder information.
BUSINESS ACTIVITIES AND DEVELOPMENT
Reports by the chairman and the chief executive on the
performance for the year and the future development of the
Group’s businesses are included at the beginning of this
document. Events announced after the year end are referred 
to in the Annual Report.
DIVIDENDS
Anglo American paid an interim dividend of 19 US cents per share
on 21 September 2004. The directors recommend a final dividend
of 51 US cents per share. Subject to approval by members at 
the AGM, the final dividend will be paid on 29 April 2005 
to shareholders on the register on 11 March 2005.
ANNUAL GENERAL MEETING
The AGM will be held at The Conference Centre, Church House,
Dean’s Y ard, London SW1P 3NZ at 11:00 am on Wednesday,
20 April 2005. The full notice of AGM is contained in the
enclosed booklet.
As part of the routine AGM business, shareholders will be asked
to approve the directors’ remuneration report and, as special
business, to renew the directors’ existing authorities to allot
ordinary shares and to make market purchases of ordinary shares.
In addition to the re-election of those directors retiring by rotation,
and upon the recommendation of the board, shareholders will 
also be asked to elect Messrs Hathorn, Médori, Thompson and
Alexander as directors as explained in further detail in the
Chairman’s questions and answers on page 3.
SUMMARY CORPORATE GOVERNANCE REPORT
Throughout the year ended 31 December 2004 the Company 
has been in compliance with the provisions set out in Section 1 
of the Combined Code on Corporate Governance issued by the
Financial Reporting Council. The directors are satisfied that 
there is an ongoing process of internal control for identifying,
evaluating and managing the significant risks faced by the Group.
The directors, their responsibilities and the current membership 
of the principal committees of the board are set out on pages 
20 and 21. Following the retirement of W A Nairn as a director 
on 31 December 2004, the board currently comprises three
executive directors and eleven non-executive directors, eight 
of whom are independent according to the definition contained 
in the Combined Code. The independent directors are 
Sir Mark Moody-Stuart, D J Challen, F T M Phaswana, 
Professor K A L M Van Miert, Dr C E Fay, G Lindahl, R J Margetts 
and Dr M S B Marques. R J Margetts is the senior independent 
non-executive director. The other non-executive directors 
are Sir David Scholey, R M Godsell and N F Oppenheimer. 
Sir David Scholey and G Lindahl have indicated that they 
will retire from the board at the AGM in April.
The board has concluded that Dr Fay and Messrs Godsell,
Margetts and Oppenheimer should continue as non-executive
directors, notwithstanding that they have served for six years, 
for the reasons explained in the full Corporate Governance Report
set out in the Annual Report.
During the year the Nomination Committee managed the process
of the selection and appointment of R Médori, with effect from 
1 June 2005, who will succeed A W Lea as Finance Director 
on 1 September 2005, and the proposed elections at the AGM 
of D A Hathorn and S R Thompson as executive directors and 
R C Alexander as a non-executive director.
With effect from 24 February 2004, Dr M S B Marques became 
a member of the Safety & Sustainable Development Committee
(formerly the Safety, Health and Environment Committee).
During the year the Audit Committee, in addition to its review 
of, inter alia, financial statements and related documents,
reviewed the Group’s progress towards the implementation of 
the new International Financial Reporting Standards and also
reviewed the verification methods for calculating ore reserves 
and mineral resources at the Group’s various operations.
Details of the remuneration policy and of the remuneration of 
the directors are given in the remuneration report in the Annual
Report and a summary of this report is set out on pages 25 to 28.
The Company values its dialogue with both institutional and
private investors. For the benefit of private investors in particular,
Anglo American has produced this short-form Annual Review
which contains the information believed to be of most interest 
to them.
The Company has commenced implementation of a whistleblowing
programme throughout its managed operations. The programme 
is in line with the Public Interest Disclosure Act 1998 to enable
employees, customers, suppliers, managers or other stakeholders
on a confidential basis, to raise concerns in cases where they
believe they have discovered malpractice or impropriety. 
The board performance evaluation process resulted in a number
of changes being made to board agenda items and informal
meetings of directors being held.

SUMMARY REMUNERATION REPORT
FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2004
This is a summary of the full remuneration report contained in the
Annual Report, copies of which may be obtained free of charge
from the Company’s Registrars or South African T ransfer Secretaries,
or may be viewed on, or downloaded from, Anglo American’s
website, www.angloamerican.co.uk
REMUNERATION COMMITTEE
Anglo American has a Remuneration Committee (the Committee)
consisting of non-executive directors, chaired by R J Margetts,
which is responsible for considering and making recommendations
to the board on executive and senior management remuneration
policy, specific remuneration packages for executive directors
and the design and operation of the Company’s share 
incentive schemes.
REMUNERATION POLICY FOR EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
Each executive director’s total remuneration consists of salary,
annual bonus, long term incentives and benefits. The basic salary
of the executive directors is reviewed annually and is targeted 
at the median of companies of comparable size, market sector,
business complexity and international scope. Company
performance, individual performance and changes in responsibilities
are also taken into consideration in setting salary levels at the
end of each year. An appropriate balance is maintained between
fixed and performance-related remuneration, and between elements
linked to short term financial performance and those linked to
longer term shareholder value creation. Assuming on-target
performance, the Committee’s policy is that around 50% (around
60% for the CEO) or more of total executive director remuneration
is performance-related. In 2004, on average, 64% of executive
directors’ actual remuneration was performance-related.
BONUS SHARE PLAN
Shareholders approved the introduction of the new Bonus Share
Plan (BSP) at the AGM in 2004 and all executive directors are
eligible to participate in the BSP. The BSP was operated for the
first time during 2004. The BSP requires executives to invest 
a significant proportion of their remuneration in shares, thereby
more closely aligning their interests with those of shareholders,
and encourages management at all levels to build up a meaningful
personal stake in the Company.
Awards under the BSP are made annually and consist of three
elements: a performance-related cash element, an equal amount
as a conditional award of Bonus Shares and an additional
performance-related element in the form of Enhancement Shares.
The value of the bonus is calculated by reference to achievement
against annual performance targets (including measures of
corporate and, where applicable, business unit performance, 
as well as the achievement of specific individual objectives). 
For executive directors, the corporate element is based on
stretching Earnings per Share (EPS) targets. In 2004, the EPS
targets were met in full. It is the Committee’s usual policy 
to base 70% of each annual bonus award on the corporate or
business unit measure, and the remaining 30% on key individual
performance measures. The level of bonuses is reduced if certain
safety improvement targets are not met. 
The Committee will review measures annually to ensure they
remain appropriate and sufficiently stretching in the context of
the economic and performance expectations for the Company
and its operating businesses.
In the case of executive directors and top-tier management, 
half of the bonus will be paid in cash. The cash element would
not normally exceed 75% of salary for the CEO and 60% of
salary for other executive directors. 
The other half of the bonus is in the form of a conditional award
of Bonus Shares equal in value to the cash element. To encourage
retention, these Bonus Shares will only vest if the participant
remains in employment with the Group until the end of a 
three year holding period, or is, in the view of Remuneration
Committee, deemed to be a ‘good leaver’.
In order to provide continuing medium term performance focus,
executive directors will also receive an award of conditional
Enhancement Shares at the same time as the award of Bonus
Shares. The maximum potential value of these Enhancement
Shares is 75% of the face value of the Bonus Shares (i.e. in 
the case of the CEO, a maximum of 56.25% of base salary).
These awards will vest after three years only to the extent that
a challenging performance condition (based on EPS growth) has
been met.
On a change of control of the Company, Bonus Shares will be
released and Enhancement Shares will vest, but only to the extent
that the applicable performance conditions have been satisfied. 
The BSP is not pensionable.
OTHER LONG TERM INCENTIVE PLANS
No awards were made to executive directors under the old deferred
bonus plan during 2004.
No share options were granted to executive directors under 
the Employee Share Option Scheme (ESOS) in 2004. In 2005,
participation in the BSP will be extended to other tiers of
management globally (circa 1,300 individuals), who will
thereafter cease to receive share option grants under the ESOS. 
Conditional Long Term Incentive Plan (LTIP) awards continue 
to be made annually to executive directors. These awards are
discretionary and are considered on a case-by-case basis. Awards
under the LTIP in 2004 were increased from 120% to 160% of
basic salary for the CEO and from 100% to 130% of basic salary
for the other executive directors in order to maintain market
competitiveness and to reflect the rebalanced incentive structure.
Vesting of LTIP awards made during 2004 is subject to the
achievement of two stretching performance measures relating 
to Total Shareholder Return (TSR) and to an operating measure,
Return on Capital Employed (ROCE), over a fixed three year
period. For awards made in 2004 and thereafter, half of each
award made to an executive director is subject to a Group TSR
measure and half is subject to a Group ROCE measure. There
will be no retesting of performance. These performance measures
were chosen on the basis that they clearly foster the creation of
shareholder value. 
The vesting of that part of the LTIP award contingent upon TSR
performance varies according to the Company’s TSR over the
performance period, relative to a weighted basket of international
natural resource companies (the Index). For awards made in 2004,
the companies constituting the Index were as follows: 26 Anglo American plc Annual Review 2004

The LTIP closely aligns the interests of shareholders and
executive directors by rewarding superior shareholder and
financial performance and by encouraging executives to build 
up a shareholding in Anglo American plc. 
In the event of a change of control of the Company, the number
of shares that vest under the LTIP will be calculated by reference
to the extent to which the applicable performance conditions
have been met at the time of the change of control.
Within five years of their appointment, executive directors are
expected to acquire a holding of shares with a value of two
times’ basic salary in the case of the chief executive and one
times’ basic salary in the case of other executive directors.
PERFORMANCE GRAPH
The graph shows the Company’s TSR performance from 
1 January 2000, against the TSR performance of the 
FTSE 100 Index, chosen as being a broad equity market index
consisting of companies of comparable size and complexity 
to Anglo American plc. In drawing this graph, it has been assumed
that all dividends paid have been re-invested. This graph has been
produced in accordance with the requirements of Schedule 7A to
the Companies Act 1985.
PENSIONS
The amounts paid into defined contribution pension schemes 
by Anglo American plc in respect of the directors who served 
during 2004 totalled £521,000 (2003: £479,000), excluding
supplementary voluntary pension contributions. Two of the
executive directors are members of defined benefit pension
schemes. The Remuneration Committee is considering UK
pension arrangements in light of the new UK pensions regime
which will apply from April 2006. Further details will be 
disclosed in the 2005 remuneration report.
EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS’ SERVICE CONTRACTS
In order properly to reflect their spread of responsibilities, 
all the executive directors, with the exception of A W Lea, 
who is employed by Anglo American International (BVI) Limited,
have contracts with Anglo American International (IOM) Limited
and with Anglo Operations Limited. The salaries under these
contracts are payable in sterling and/or South African rand as
appropriate. The employment contracts of all executive directors
are terminable at 12 months’ notice by either party and each
contains a provision that sets out the compensation payable 
in lieu of notice if the Company terminates the contract (other
than for cause) or the director resigns in circumstances where
there has been a material adverse change in role, responsibilities
or remuneration. Compensation is based on the value of 
12 months’ basic salary, target annual bonus for 12 months 
and the annual value of benefits. In light of current best practice
guidelines, the Committee has determined that liquidated damages
clauses will not be included in service contracts for new
appointments to the board. The service contracts of executive
directors do not provide for any enhanced payments in the 
event of a change of control of the Company.
NON-EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS’ REMUNERATION AND
SERVICE CONTRACTS
Non-executive director remuneration is set at a level which is
sufficient to attract and retain world-class non-executive talent
and which is consistent with recognised best practice. Non-
executive directors may not participate in the Company’s Bonus
Share Plan, share option schemes, LTIP or pension arrangements.
The board reviews non-executive directors’ fees periodically 
to ensure they remain market-competitive. All non-executive
directors have letters of appointment with Anglo American plc
for an initial period of three years from their date of appointment,
subject to re-election at the AGM.

Subsequent to their retirement from the board, L Boyd and M W King continue to hold non-executive directorships with certain listed subsidiaries of the Group. They received fees of £29,000 
and £21,000 respectively for the provision of these services during the year.
(2)
Since A J Trahar, B E Davison and W A Nairn had no provision for past service in respect of their sterling-denominated pension fund, their employing company has contractually agreed that
supplementary pension contributions should be made to the Anglo American plc International Approved Pension Scheme in return for these executives giving up their right to part of their 
future basic salary. The table above shows these amounts, which are £89,000, £47,000 and £42,000 respectively.
(3)
Each director received a car allowance or a fully expensed car and a limited amount of personal taxation/financial advice. All directors, with the exception of W A Nairn, also received medical
insurance and death and disability insurance. A J Trahar, A W Lea and W A Nairn received club membership; in addition, A J Trahar received a housing loan subsidy.
(4)
The 2004 bonus represents the cash element of the Bonus Share Plan payable in 2005. The share elements under this scheme for 2004 will be awarded during 2005.
(5)
The value of the bonus under the Bonus Share Plan is calculated by reference to measures of both corporate performance (based on stretching EPS targets) as well as the achievement of specific
individual objectives. In 2004, the EPS targets were met in full. Half of the bonus is paid in cash and the other half takes the form of a conditional award of Bonus Shares equal in value to the
cash element (see footnote 11 below).
(6)
On retirement at 31 December 2004, W A Nairn received payment for accumulated untaken leave of £19,000 and an award to mark completion of 40 years of service of £2,000 . 
(7)
No share options were granted to executive directors during the year, although 100,828 options were exercised by executive directors in 2004. B E Davison exercised his remaining 38,325 
Anglo Platinum share options during the year. R M Godsell also has 224,300 share options in AngloGold Ashanti.
(8)
The exercise of options under the ESOS is subject to Anglo American’s EPS (based on the Company’s headline earnings measure) increasing by at least 6% above the UK Retail Price Index 
over a three-year period. The EPS growth requirement takes account of the cyclical nature of the natural resources business.
(9)
In addition, at 31 December 2004, A J Trahar and W A Nairn held 5,000 and 82,000 roll-over options respectively.
(10)
211,254 conditional awards of shares were made to executive directors under the LTIP during the year. The vesting of those LTIP awards is subject to the achievement of stretching performance
measures relating to TSR and ROCE. In 2004, 99,773 awards vested to executive directors under the first LTIP scheme. The outcome on the Group ROCE element of the 2001 LTIP was 61.7%
and on the TSR element 54%. Thus the average vesting level for those directors with a 50% Group ROCE, 50% TSR split was 57.9%.
(11)
79,189 Bonus Shares and 59,393 Enhancement Shares were conditionally awarded to executive directors under the Bonus Share Plan during 2004 (in respect of 2003 performance). 
Bonus Shares vest if the executive director remains in employment with the Group until the end of the three-year holding period. The Enhancement Shares will vest to the extent that 
challenging EPS performance conditions are met.
(12)
No further awards were made to executive directors under the Deferred Bonus Plan during the year. 29,284 awards vested to the executive directors during the year. 28 Anglo American plc Annual Review 2004

INDEPENDENT REMUNERATION REPORT REVIEW
This letter reports on the results of the review carried out by
Mercer Human Resource Consulting Limited of the processes
followed by the Anglo American Remuneration Committee (the
Committee) that support the Remuneration Report for the financial
year 2004. Mercer undertook the review at the request of the
Chairman of the Committee in order to provide shareholders with
assurance that the remuneration processes followed are appropriate
and that the Committee has complied with the policies set out in
the Remuneration Report.
In order to reach our opinion, we reviewed the Committee’s Terms
of Reference and the minutes of its meetings held during the year
as well as material presented to the Committee for its review.
We also interviewed the Chairman and Secretary of the Committee.
Our review was not intended to audit the compensation data set
forth in the Remuneration Report or to evaluate the merits of
Anglo American’s remuneration programme.
Based on our review, Mercer is of the opinion that the process
followed by the Committee during 2004 was fully consistent
with its Terms of Reference and that the decisions taken by 
the Committee were in line with the principles set out in the
Remuneration Report. It continues to be our view that the
Committee takes a suitably robust approach to its work. We would
note in particular the changes to long term incentive arrangements
which have been proposed in response to dialogue held with
institutional investors.
We note that the Committee has refined its modus operandi 
each year, taking into account any comments we have made 
in our reviews. As a result, we believe that the Committee 
is exemplary in its conduct, decision-making and reporting. 
The members of the Committee are regularly updated on executive
compensation and corporate governance matters.
Further detail regarding the Mercer review is included in a letter
of this date addressed to the Committee’s chairman, which we
understand will be made available on the Company’s website.

The comparative years have been restated to reflect the adoption of UITF abstract 38 ‘Accounting for ESOP trusts’.
(2)
1999, 2000 and 2001 have been restated for the adoption of FRS 19.
(3)
As first noted in 2002, operating profit for 2000 has been restated for the reclassification of the loss of $167 million arising on the anticipated disposal of Terra Industries Inc. The disposal did not
proceed and the loss has therefore been reclassified into operating exceptional items as an impairment.
(4)
2000 and 1999 have been restated to reflect the three-for-one bonus issue in May 2001.
(5)
EBITDA is operating profit before exceptional items plus depreciation and amortisation in subsidiaries and share of EBITDA of joint ventures and associates.
(6)
EBITDA interest cover is EBITDA divided by net interest expense, excluding other net financial income (2004: $119 million) and exceptional financing charges (2004: nil). EBITDA interest cover for
2002 is annualised to account for acquisitions during the year. The actual EBITDA interest cover for 2002 was 25.5 times. For 2000 and 1999 EBITDA interest cover is not applicable as the Group
was a net interest recipient after adjusting for other net financial income.
(7)
Total capital is the sum of shareholders’ funds, net debt and minority interests.
(8)
Return on capital employed is calculated as total operating profit before impairments for the year divided by the average total capital less other investments and adjusted for impairments. 30 Anglo American plc Annual Review 2004

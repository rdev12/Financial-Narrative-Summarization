The structure of our business
We are the largest healthcare services provider in the fast-growing, predominantly privately-owned, Georgian healthcare services market. We lead 
the market by offering the most comprehensive range of inpatient and outpatient services and by targeting the mass market segment through our 
vertically integrated network of 35 hospitals and ten ambulatory clusters, as at 31 December 2016.
GHG’s market leading position, its unique business model with significant growth potential, and its experienced management team make it a 
compelling investment story. Furthermore, the first class leaders of our medical team are driving the improvement of service quality and access  
to healthcare across the organisation. These factors, together with the improved access to healthcare services through the Universal Healthcare 
Programme (“UHC”) financing, enable us to capitalise on existing service gaps and the overall lower quality of medical care in the country.
 Largest healthcare service provider in Georgia: 23.4% 
market share by number of beds (2,557), which is expected 
to grow to c.29% as a result of the renovation of two major 
hospital facilities, scheduled for completion in 2017 (additional 
c.600 beds)
1
 Largest pharmaceuticals retailer and wholesaler in 
Georgia: After completing the acquisition of ABC pharmacy, 
in January 2017 , we have merged it with our existing pharma 
business, GPC. The combined pharma business has 29% 
market share by sales, over two million client interactions per 
month, with 0.5 million loyalty card members. We started 
consolidating ABC’s financial results from January 2017
 Largest medical insurer in Georgia: c.211,000 persons 
insured and 35.3% market share

 Widest Population Coverage: coverage of over 3/4 of 
Georgia’s 3.7 million population

 with 35 high-quality 
hospitals, 13 district and 28 express ambulatory clinics and 
243 pharmacies
4
 (including ABC’s pharmacies) 
 Institutionalising the industry: Strong corporate 
governance; standardised processes; improving safety and 
quality by implementing Joint Commission International 
(“JCI”) benchmarked standards; own personnel training centre
 The single largest integrated player in the Georgia 
Healthcare ecosystem of GEL 3.4 billion aggregated  
value with cost advantage through scale: purchasing, 
centralisation of administrative functions
 – Next healthcare services competitor has only 4% market 
share by beds 
 – Largest purchaser of pharmaceutical products in Georgia
 Better access to professional management and high 
calibre talent
 – One of the largest employers in the country: c.12,811 
full-time employees, including 3,218 physicians, 2,869 
nurses and 721 pharmacists

 Referral system & synergies with insurance and  
pharma business:
 – Presence along the patient pathway and referral synergies
 – Insurance activities provide steady revenue stream for our 
ambulatory clinics and bolster hospital patient referrals
 – 0.5 million loyal customers at our pharma business with 
upside to cross-sell
 Very low base: healthcare services spending per capita only 
US$217 , outpatient encounters are only 4.0 per capita 
annually
5
, GHG revenue per hospital bed is only US$34,000

, with real GDP growth 
averaged 4.5% annually during 2007-2016. Only 5.8% of GDP 
is spent on healthcare services and spending at healthcare 
services growing at 9% CAGR 2008-2013; Government 
spending nearly doubled between 2011-2015
8
 Implying long-term, high-growth expansion that is driven by: 
 – Universal Healthcare Programme covering Georgia’s 
population driving utilisation of basic healthcare services 
nationwide, primarily inpatient (inpatient market was GEL 
1,075 million in 2014)
 – Pick-up in ambulatory growth (outpatient market was  
only GEL 802 million in 2014) driven by newly introduced 
prescription policy and improved quality in supply
9
 – The medical equipment market is expected to grow due 
to historical underinvestment
 Strong business management team – increased market 
share by beds from under 1% in 2009 to 23.4% currently, 
with built-in additional development capacity
 Achieved our target of c.30% EBITDA margin ahead of 
time, delivering 31.9% healthcare services EBITDA margin 
in 4Q16 and 30.2% in 2016
 Robust corporate governance: leader in Georgia’s 
healthcare sector, as the only Premium listed company in the 
industry (LSE:GHG LN)

Georgia Healthcare Group PLC  Annual Report 2016  Strategic report
GHG delivered an excellent  
year in 2016 in a number  
of important areas
Chairman’s statement
• GHG’s management team is growing 
stronger than ever.
The key drivers of GHG’s growth 
in 2017 and beyond
We will continue the development of 
new, high-quality medical services in 
Georgia, particularly focusing on elective 
care, to cover existing service gaps. 
Despite significant recent reforms in the 
Georgian healthcare system, there are still 
many service gaps in Georgia which, as the 
largest provider of healthcare services in 
the country, GHG is focused on covering. 
These are services which either do not 
exist or are currently of low quality. Patients 
often bridge this gap by travelling to 
hospitals abroad, the spending on which  
is estimated at approximately US$100 
million. Covering medical service gaps in 
Georgia by developing new services and 
institutionalising improved quality makes  
us proud of the work we do for our 
patients. We strongly believe that by 
investing in the healthcare market in 
Georgia, we will support an increase in the 
quality of care for the Georgian population, 
throughout the country. During 2016, we 
have launched over 60 new services in 
different locations and many more are 
under development. You will have an 
opportunity to read more about the service 
gaps and what we do to cover them later  
in this report.
We will continue the roll out of our 
outpatient clinics, because this is a 
highly fragmented and underserved 
market where we see a significant 
opportunity for growth. During Soviet 
times, we used to have “polyclinics”  
in Georgia. They were many – in 
neighbourhoods close to home. Citizens 
were assigned to one of those “polyclinics” 
for all kinds of outpatient services. With the 
collapse of the Soviet Union, many 
“polyclinics” closed, some significantly 
shrank and all became dilapidated. It may 
seem paradoxical that the Georgian 
healthcare services sector has seen much 
investment and development in recent 
years and yet the market of “polyclinics”  
or their equivalents is still so 
underdeveloped. This is because  
Georgia’s recent healthcare reforms and  
the subsequent investments were primarily 
targeted at hospitals to ensure the 
population had access to the much needed 
hospital level care. GHG is already the 
largest provider in this segment with the 
outpatient clinics that are the first of their 
kind in the country, but in a way our clinics 
are a modern version of the well-known 
concept of “polyclinics” . We see the same 
opportunity now in the fragmented 
outpatient sector that we saw in the 
hospital business a number of years ago. 
We aim to grow footprint and utilisation 
quickly, to achieve by 2018 c.5% share of 
this market that is expected to be valued  
at approximately c.GEL 1 billion. We aim  
to significantly increase cross-referral 
synergies with our pharmacies and medical 
insurance to drive high utilisation of 
our “polyclinics” .
Investing in information systems will  
be our next priority to identify ways  
in which we can provide better service 
to our patients and deliver more value  
to our shareholders. With the scale and 
diversity of GHG’s business, we are best 
positioned to lead the way in the 
digitalisation of patient records in Georgia. 
We have made this a key priority and are 
taking significant steps to make it happen.  
I am glad that we have a strong IT team 
that will lead this very important 
transformation throughout the organisation. 
GHG’s growth prospects are 
supported by attractive macro-
economic performance and the 
Georgian Government’s 
healthcare policy
During 2016, Georgia once again 
demonstrated its commitment to European 
standards and norms by ensuring full and 
fair democratic parliamentary elections. 
Georgia has continued to deliver a 
remarkably resilient economic performance, 
with real GDP growth at 2.7% in 2016.  
In addition, Foreign Direct Investment 
continued to be strong, and tourist 
numbers – a significant driver of Dollar 
inflows for the country – continued to  
rise significantly. 
Dear Shareholders,
I am honoured to report that GHG delivered 
an excellent year in 2016 in a number of 
important areas. I want to particularly 
emphasise three of those. First, GHG 
delivered an exceptional performance on 
the strategy announced at the time of its 
IPO in November 2015, building on an 
unprecedented period of growth over the 
past two years. Second, GHG diversified 
into the pharma business – an important 
move to unlock more value from our 
business and solidify GHG’s leading 
position in the healthcare ecosystem in 
Georgia. Last, but certainly very important, 
GHG’s management team continued to get 
stronger at the senior and middle 
management level – growing our 
management team is a priority of ours  
and I am particularly proud to see such 
meaningful progress in this direction. 
You can see the details of the financial 
performance, execution perspective and 
business priorities at a granular level in the 
CEO letter later in this report. I would like to 
cover four important points in this letter:
• the key drivers of GHG’s growth in 2017 
and beyond;
• GHG’s growth prospects are supported 
by attractive macro-economic 
performance and the Georgian 
Government’s healthcare policy;
• robust corporate governance drives  
our returns; and 9

Strategic report
Overview
Georgia is an open and resilient emerging 
market with a realistic ambition to 
transform itself into a regional hub 
economy. Georgia is consistently ranked  
as a top performer in governance and 
“Doing Business” indicators, in economic 
policy and institutional assessments tracked 
by well-respected international institutions. 
Georgia was named a top performer 
globally over the past 12 years in the latest 
“WB-IFC Doing Business” report. The 
Government’s four-pillar reform programme, 
and its deepening economic integration 
with the European Union is expected to 
boost the economy’s productive capacity, 
support further economic diversification 
and attract more foreign investment. 
Access to healthcare remains one of the 
Government’s top priorities. Since the full 
rollout of UHC in mid-2014, government 
expenditure on healthcare has grown 
considerably, increasing to over 100% from 
GEL 487 .9 million in 2013, to GEL 996.0 
million in 2016. 
Robust corporate governance 
drives our returns
In my letter last year, I provided significant 
detail about the governance structure, the 
way the Board works and the composition 
of our Board. A year later, I am particularly 
proud about the important role that the 
GHG Board continues to play in growing  
the institution. Therefore, I would like to 
highlight several critical thoughts:
• At GHG, we remain strong believers  
that great institutions are only built with 
robust governance, and that without it 
they cannot deliver sustainable value  
for their shareholders. I am happy that  
at GHG we have built a Board that is 
independent, highly engaged, has 
diversity of thoughts, is able to provide 
strong oversight together with valuable 
advice, guidance and coaching to the top 
and middle-level management teams.  
I am proud that we continue to enrich 
the Board and management and 
continue to attract high quality people 
with relevant experience in the delivery 
of quality healthcare.
• We want our managers to act as 
shareholders, which they are. The 
remuneration structure that we have for 
the management at GHG naturally aligns 
the interests of shareholders and the 
management team. This is achieved by 
awarding, as part of their remuneration 
package, long-term vesting shares (up to 
five years) to the executive management 
team and ensuring that this share-based 
compensation makes up a large 
proportion (e.g. 80-85%) of total annual 
compensation. If shareholders make 
money, the management team makes 
money and if the shareholders lose 
money, the management team also  
 
 
 
loses money. In this way, we create  
a long-term alignment between the 
interests of the management team  
and the shareholders. This structure 
makes the Board’s job of oversight easier. 
GHG’s management team is 
growing stronger than ever
Attracting, growing and enabling the 
management team to perform at their best 
is our number one priority. Management 
makes things happen at GHG and I am 
proud that the majority of our management 
at GHG has been with us for several years, 
and the team has grown together with the 
organisation. From time to time, we also 
enhance our management team through 
hiring externally. Still, promoting internally  
is our preference. GHG’s team is young, 
motivated, capable and most importantly, 
eager to learn and do more, dedicated to 
the performance of the organisation and  
to helping each other to deliver. We get the 
benefit of a double effect from GHG 
attracting talent, and that strong talent 
attracting great new talent.
At GHG we have a culture of delegation, 
accountability and coaching – cornerstones 
of people development in our organisation. 
We provide opportunities for our 
management to grow through challenging 
and diverse experiences. We do this 
through promotions and rotations. We are  
a meritocratic organisation. We value 
results and we also coach our management 
to unlock their best potential. Our senior 
team members have access to leadership 
coaching. Our middle management has 
access to targeted courses around 
management and leadership development, 
developing into the next tranche of leaders, 
and enhancing the management team  
at GHG. 
I am proud to recap 2016, which proved an 
excellent year for GHG. I am honoured to 
continue to serve as the Chairman of this 
great institution and the team, and I look 
confidently to the future growth of GHG.

Georgia Healthcare Group PLC  Annual Report 2016  Strategic report
2016 was another extremely  
strong year for Georgia  
Healthcare Group
Chief Executive Officer’s statement
of the Pharmadepot chain of pharmacies – 
the fourth largest pharma retailer in Georgia 
(operating with 125 pharmacies) – which 
has made GHG the market leader in the 
pharma segment with c.29% market share 
by revenue. I am delighted that the 
integration of these two large retailers  
is going smoothly and is fully on track.
The 2016 results clearly reflect these 
significant developments, and I am 
pleased to report a net profit of GEL 61.3 
million, a 159.7% increase year-on-year 
from GEL 23.6 million in 2015. These 
results were, however, affected by the 
impact of a number of one-off items and 
business changes, net effect of which 
increased profit by GEL 21 .7 million, the 
largest of which was the deferred tax 
release due to a corporate tax legislation 
change. On an operational basis, the Group 
made extremely good progress during the 
year with net revenues up 74.8% to GEL 
423.8 million; EBITDA up 39.0% to GEL 
78.0 million; and profit before income tax 
expense up 70.2% to GEL 40.2 million. 
Within this strong year-on-year 
performance, the Group continued to build 
strongly on a sequential basis, with record 
high revenue in both the healthcare 
services business and the pharma 
business. Profit before income tax expense 
in the 4Q of 2016 was GEL 13.0 million, up 
156.9% on the 4Q of 2015, and up 25.6% 
on the 3Q of the year, giving the Group a 
strong earnings tailwind going into 2017 . 
The Group’s overall performance continues 
to be driven by the healthcare services 
business which delivered net revenues  
of GEL 243.5 million, supported by 16.3% 
organic revenue growth and a 280 basis 
point EBITDA margin improvement to 
30.2%. 
In our healthcare services business, the 
Group’s key strategic priorities are: to 
achieve one-third market share by hospital 
beds; to deliver a rapid launch of 
outpatient clinics in the highly fragmented 
and underpenetrated outpatient market; 
and to invest to close existing medical 
service gaps in Georgia. During 2016, we 
continued to make significant progress in 
each of these areas. The renovation work 
2016 was another extremely strong year  
for Georgia Healthcare Group, as the Group 
continued to build strongly in all areas of 
the wider Georgian healthcare ecosystem 
including, for the first time, in the 
pharmaceutical retail and wholesale sector. 
We are delighted with our progress 
towards creating the highest quality 
hospital and primary healthcare system  
in the country while delivering the best 
outcomes, with high patient satisfaction 
and the best facilities supporting significant 
improvement in the quality of care 
in Georgia.
During the year, the Group continued to 
grow its operations both organically and 
via acquisitions. We have made significant 
progress in the implementation of our 
strategy to develop a nationwide chain of 
outpatient clinics, subsequently growing 
our capacity to provide quality outpatient 
services to a much larger part of Georgia’s 
population. We increased the number of 
district outpatient clinics from seven to 13 
during 2016, as well as now having 28 
express clinics in operation. In May 2016, 
we completed the acquisition of GPC,  
one of the largest retail and wholesale 
pharmacy chains in Georgia. GPC operates 
a countrywide network of 118 pharmacies 
in major cities. The acquisition created a 
number of substantial purchase synergy 
opportunities, as well as significant 
potential for increased customer acquisition 
in our outpatient business. In addition, in 
January 2017 , we completed the acquisition 
on both our Deka and Sunstone hospital 
facilities in Tbilisi has continued. In August, 
we opened one of the largest diagnostic 
centres in Georgia as part of the Deka 
hospital – the first step in developing Deka 
into a flagship multi-profile hospital for the 
country which we will also leverage to 
retain those patients currently going abroad 
for healthcare diagnostics and treatment. 
The renovation at Sunstone has been 
completed ahead of time and we are 
pleased to have recently received the first 
patients into this new multi-profile hospital. 
The opening of Sunstone enables the 
population of the eastern part of Tbilisi and 
the whole of the Kakheti region to get 
access to significantly improved healthcare 
services closer to their homes. 
Another key milestone for our development 
is more focus on planned and elective 
services. GHG hospitals have the best 
reputation in the country in treating 
emergency and complex cases which  
we can further build on in terms of planned 
and elective services. We have already 
implemented a strategy for that and will  
be developing further in some areas and 
services which we believe will increase our 
diversification and efficiency. We are 
currently in the process of launching more 
than 60 new services in more than ten of 
our referral hospitals. These services are 
primarily targeted at filling service gaps that 
currently exist in Georgia either due to the 
unavailability of the service or its poor 
quality. Our new service launches include  
a number of sophisticated services such as 
oncology, transplantation of bone marrow 
and paediatric kidney transplants, as well  
as services such as paediatrics, neonatology 
and ophthalmology. Our main focus in 2017 
will be to increase our presence in the Tbilisi 
market, where we see substantial room to 
grow, especially in elective services. 
Our strategy to increase our share of 
healthcare revenues through the roll-out of 
a nationwide network of outpatient clinics 
has continued and we grew the number of 
our district clinics from seven in December 
2015, to 13 in December 2016, with 
revenues from this part of the business 
increasing more than 120% year-on-year. 11

Overview
During 2016, we made significant 
progress in monitoring and improving  
a number of clinical quality indicators 
within our referral hospitals and more 
improvements are planned in 2017 .  
In this direction, we are involved in number 
of initiatives such as training professionals 
in clinical quality areas and in the internal 
process of development and 
implementation of clinical quality activity 
programmes and standards. In 2016 six 
such programmes were developed and 
already implemented in ten of our hospitals. 
During the year, we worked closely with 
the Centres for Disease Control and 
Prevention (“CDC”), the United States local 
representative office in south Caucasus. 
With our and CDC’s joint efforts, we 
implemented an infection control and 
prevention programme at three of our 
healthcare facilities. Our local team, which 
worked with CDC on this project, continues 
to implement the programme at our other 
hospitals as well.
2016 was a particularly busy year for us 
in terms of expanding into the pharma 
business and becoming the largest 
company in this market. In May we 
completed the acquisition of GPC, one  
of the largest retail and wholesale 
pharmacy chains in Georgia, and have made 
substantial progress with our integration 
activities. With important synergies from 
the GPC acquisition already having been 
captured, we are comfortably on track to 
deliver our initial guidance on synergies, 
and more than tripled the EBITDA margin  
in 4Q to 6.0%, from 1 .8% in 2Q 2016. 
We believe, however, that the biggest value 
enhancement from the GPC acquisition is 
the potential for increased customer 
acquisition for our outpatient business 
through GPC’s one million customer 
interactions per month and 0.5 million 
loyalty programme users and we have 
already started to explore this opportunity. 
In August, we launched a bundled product 
for our pharma and outpatient businesses 
to access around 500,000 GPC customers 
who have never been to our outpatient 
facilities, and we expect to direct over 
10,000 new customers per month from  
our pharmacies to our clinics.
In addition, in November 2016 we 
announced the acquisition of ABC, the 
fourth largest player in the Georgian pharma 
market and owner of the Pharmadepot 
chain of pharmacies. We completed the 
transaction in January 2017 , and as a result 
GHG has become the market leader in the 
pharma market (with c.29% market share 
by revenue) in Georgia. The Pharmadepot 
acquisition has a strong strategic fit with 
our existing business model. We aim to 
keep both brands, as they have a distinct 
positioning in two customer segments: 
GPC for higher-end customers and 
Pharmadepot for the mass retail. Together 
with the strong Pharmadepot retail 
franchise, we also brought their strong 
management team to the Group, and they 
are now leading our integrated pharma 
business. This new team brings an excellent 
track record of growth and execution that 
managed to grow a niche wholesale 
company into one of the largest pharma 
retailers in 4-5 years. The integration 
process is ongoing and I’m pleased to 
announce that it is going smoothly and is 
expected to be finalised in the second half 
of 2017 as anticipated. We are confident 
that we will achieve the key efficiency 
metrics that we have targeted for the 
combined pharma business and, as a result, 
create substantial value for our shareholders. 
Apart from significant cost synergies in 
areas of procurement and administrative 
expenses, we aim to focus on three main 
areas in the combined pharma business 
over the next two to three years: 
decreasing the cost of goods sold/cost 
of services by realising captive cost 
synergies and manufacturer cost 
synergies; enhancing the retail margin 
by launching generic, contract 
manufactured and private label products; 
and expanding sales to hospitals and 
other small players in pharma. We will be 
further expanding our footprint selectively 
both in large cities as well as in many 
regions of Georgia, and will realise 
additional revenue synergies in healthcare 
services from the traffic from our combined 
pharma business that we expect to average 
two million customer interactions 
per month. 
Our medical insurance business had a more 
challenging year, particularly reflecting the 
loss-making impact of one large corporate 
insurance contract. This contract has now 
expired and has not been renewed. As a 
result, we expect to see a stabilisation of 
earnings in 2017 , compared to a loss of GEL 
4.9 million in 2016. 
One of our main priorities: people 
development, continued to be high on 
our agenda throughout 2016. The depth 
of our senior management team continued 
to improve with the recruitment of several 
high performing key executives. In addition, 
25 executives from our mid-level 
management team completed a tailored  
six month course for them to improve their 
leadership and managerial skills. On the 
clinical side, we continued to focus on the 
education and training of our doctors and 
nurses. Our residency programme, which  
is a very important part of our strategy to 
develop a new generation of doctors, 
became the most popular residency 
programme in the country among resident 
doctors and, with 58 residents currently in 
our system, we anticipate accepting a 
further c.100 in 2017 . Our nursing training 
college is also now fully functional, and we 
will be further increasing its scale during 
 
 
2017 . People development, one of our key 
success factors, will remain a top priority  
in 2017 as well.
Focus on IT development, will be 
another key objective for us in 2017  
and beyond and the recent management 
reshuffle and strengthening in this field was 
done to further support this goal. In 2016 
we successfully rolled out an integrated 
Enterprise Resource Planning (“ERP”) 
system and a core billing and registration 
module in our healthcare business. We are 
going to increase this IT focus over the next 
few years, as we believe that our superior 
IT competencies will be key for our success 
as we look for GHG to move to the next 
level of development in the provision of 
integrated services across the whole 
patient pathway. 
We remain comfortably on track to 
deliver a more than doubling of 2015 
healthcare services revenues by 2018. 
Healthcare services net revenue 
increased by 27 .2% year-on-year in 2016, 
with organic revenue growth of more 
than 16%. In addition, the rapid roll-out  
of our nationwide outpatient clinic model,  
and our significant new participation in the 
Georgian pharmaceuticals market will 
continue to create further business 
development and cost efficiency 
opportunities over the next few years.  
At the same time, we continue to expect 
the overall Georgian healthcare services 
market revenues to grow at a double-digit 
rate per annum over the next few years, 
development of which, alongside with UHC 
programme, remains as one of the top 
priorities for the Georgian Government. 
The Group delivered a strong performance 
in 2016, and remains in good shape to 
benefit over the next few years from the 
combination of its position as the largest 
healthcare services provider, 
pharmaceuticals wholesaler and retailer  
and medical insurer in what continues to  
be a fast-growing, predominantly privately-
owned, Georgian healthcare market.  
As a result, the Group is well positioned  
to deliver further strong growth in 2017  
and beyond.

Georgia’s macro 
overview and outlook
Georgia – an open and resilient emerging 
market with a realistic ambition to 
transform itself into a Regional Hub 
Economy. The Government’s four-pillar 
reform programme and deepening 
economic integration with the European 
Union (“EU”) is expected to boost the 
economy’s productive capacity, support 
further economic diversification and attract 
foreign investments. Measures to sustain 
fiscal discipline and increase the usage of 
local currency are expected to insure 
macroeconomic stability, strengthen 
resilience to external headwinds and  
boost growth in 2017 and beyond.
The country is ranked 16th out of 189 
economies in the World Bank’s 2017 Ease 
of Doing Business, 13th out of 180 
countries by Index of Economic Freedom 
measured by Heritage Foundation in 2017 
and 11th out of 197 countries in the Trace 
International’s 2014 Matrix of Business 
Bribery Risk. With only 7% of people 
admitting to having paid a bribe according 
to the 2016 Global Corruption Barometer 
study by Transparency International, Georgia 
is on a par with EU member states. Georgia 
once again demonstrated its commitment 
to European standards and norms by 
ensuring 2016 democratic parliamentary 
elections. After the elections, Georgia’s 
ruling Georgian Dream party introduced  
a package of legislative changes to support 
the implementation of the Government’s 
four-pillar reform programme (introduced  
in February 2016) to boost growth and 
enhance the economy’s resilience to 
external shocks. The programme includes 
new tax benefits, infrastructure schemes, 
governance reforms and modernisation of 
the education system. 
Over the past decades, Georgia carried  
out genuine economic and structural 
improvements which were institutionalised. 
As a result of eradicated corruption, doing 
business became easier, productivity was 
enhanced and the economy diversified – 
enabling the country to withstand recent 
shocks related to the commodity price 
slump with a relative strength. The real GDP 
growth averaged 4.5% annually during 
2007-2016. The economic Liberty Act, 
effective since January 2014, ensures 
continuation of a credible fiscal and 
monetary framework for Georgia, by capping 
consolidated Government expenditures at 
30% of GDP , fiscal deficit at 3% of GDP and 
public debt at 60% of GDP . The Liberty Act 
also requires electorates’ approval for a 
nationwide referendum for imposing new 
taxes and raising existing tax rates, subject 
to certain exceptions. Georgia has one of the 
world’s most friendly tax regimes according 
to Forbes Misery Tax Index. It has slashed 
the number of taxes from 21 in 2004 to just 
six. Furthermore, effective since January 
2017 , corporate income tax is applicable to 
only distributed profits, as undistributed 
profits, whether reinvested or retained,  
are exempted.
Healthcare  
services market
Georgia’ s healthcare services market (including 
hospitals and ambulatory clinics) was 
estimated to be worth GEL 2.1 billion in 2015, 
which represents only 5.8% of Georgia’ s GDP . 
The market has maintained a strong 
compound growth momentum of 13.5% 
between 2011 and 2014, and is expected to 
continue growing at 13.3% between 2014 and 
2018. Since the full rollout of UHC in mid-2014, 
Government expenditure on healthcare has 
grown considerably, increasing 104.1% from 
GEL 487 .9 million in 2013 to an GEL 996.0 
million in 2016, according to the approved 
Government budget for 2016.
Healthcare services spending per capita is 
currently at a very low base of only US$217 , 
with annual outpatient encounters of only 
4.0 per capita and hospital bed utilisation of 
only c.60%, all significantly lower than 
many comparable countries. For the past 
several years, supportive Government 
reforms and the engagement of private 
players in the sector have resulted in 
significant improvements in the overall 
standard of infrastructure and greatly 
boosted demand for quality 
healthcare services.
• The hospital market was GEL 1 .2 billion 
in 2015 and this is forecasted to grow  
at a compound annual growth rate of 
11 .3% between 2014 and 2018.
• The ambulatory clinic market was GEL 
0.9 billion in 2015 and is forecasted to 
grow at a compound annual growth rate 
of 15.9% between 2014 and 2018. 
Notably, the ambulatory market is highly 
fragmented, with no single competitor 
having more than 1% of the market.
• Currently, service gaps exist in a number 
of basic diagnostics areas and 
treatments, such as MRI, laparoscopic 
surgeries, oncology, paediatrics, 
neonatology, intensive care, cardiology 
and rehabilitation services.

of the lowest per capita expenditures  
on healthcare in the EU and the CIS. 
Management believes that there are 
strong prospects for growth in 
healthcare expenditure driven by both 
supply and demand.
Outlook and main  
growth drivers
As described above, the Georgian 
healthcare services market has shown 
double-digit growth in recent years, 
standing at GEL 2.1 billion in 2015 and 
forecast to reach GEL 3.1 billion by 2018. 
The hospital segment accounted for 57% 
of all revenues generated in the healthcare 
market in 2014. According to forecasts by 
Frost & Sullivan, the hospitals segment is 
expected to grow at a compound annual 
growth rate of 11 .3% from 2014 to 2018 to 
reach GEL 1 .6 billion. The ambulatory clinic 
segment is forecast to outpace the total 
market and grow at a compound annual 
growth rate of 15.9% from 2014 to 2018  
to reach GEL 1 .4 billion by 2018. The main 
growth drivers for healthcare services in 
Georgia are the following:
• Improving infrastructure to support 
demand. Continued investment in 
healthcare infrastructure, mainly by 
private healthcare providers that 
continue to expand their businesses to 
address the growing demand for quality 
medical care from the population. This 
has included modernising Soviet-era 
hospitals, upgrading medical 
technologies, facilitating easier access  
to healthcare and the addition of over 
150 new hospitals between 2007 and 
2013 (with approximately 90% under 
private ownership). These developments 
also reflect an inflow of investments 
from strategic financial investors into the 
market given its high-growth potential. 
An increase in demand and 
hospitalisation rates is also expected  
as a result of the growing availability of 
affordable quality healthcare services, 
improving diagnostic services and 
increasing healthcare awareness in 
Georgia. By way of an example, 
according to analysis by Frost & Sullivan, 
the hospitalisation rate per 100,000 
people in Georgia for cardiovascular 
diseases was 2.5 times lower than in  
EU countries, which indicates a large 
number of undiagnosed or untreated 
conditions. The resulting growth in 
hospitalisation rates could drive 
efficiency in inpatient facilities. Utilisation 
of beds in Georgia, as measured by bed 
occupancy rates, has the potential to 
increase by between 15 to 20 ppts.
• Supportive Government healthcare 
policies. Since its introduction in March 
2013, the UHC has provided the entire 
population with access to basic 
healthcare and is expected to help 
increase demand for medical care, 
particularly hospital services. In addition, 
the Georgian Government has been 
steadily increasing the budget that it 
allocates to healthcare, including to the 
UHC and specific, disease-oriented, 
vertical programmes. According to budget 
announcements by the Georgian Ministry 
of Finance, healthcare spending is 
planned to amount to GEL 97 4 million in 
2017 , of which the addressable market  
for private healthcare providers (such as 
GHG) is GEL 810 million, including 
approximately GEL 660 million for the 
UHC and GEL 150 million for other 
healthcare programmes financed by  
the state, in addition to the UHC. 
• Until September 2014, the majority  
of drugs in Georgia were sold without  
a prescription. Since then, the 
Government has introduced prescription 
requirements for over 6,000 types of 
medicines, including antibiotics, 
cardiovascular, hormonal, endocrine and 
oncology products that account for more 
than 50% of medicines registered in 
Georgia. This initiative drives demand  
for outpatient visits and reduces the 
widespread practice of self-treatment.

Healthcare service providers (both state 
and private) generate revenue from out-of 
pocket payments (including fee-for-service 
and UHC co-payments), transfers from 
state healthcare programmes and 
payments from private medical insurance 
companies. 
Pharma companies’ revenue generation  
is primarily driven by out-of pocket retail 
revenue of the pharmacies, together with 
wholesale revenues from hospitals, 
insurance companies and the state.
Medical insurance companies depend on 
revenues from medical insurance policies 
purchased by employers for their 
employees and by individuals for their 
own use.
While the Georgian Government is the 
main source of hospital service financing  
in the country, the total Government 
expenditure on health is very low at 2.7% 
of GDP , compared to the 5.0% benchmark 
set by peer countries, which leaves 
significant room for growth. The Georgian 
healthcare industry has undergone a 
number of reforms and transformations 
during the last two decades. Favourable 
Government policy has resulted in 
the following:
• The privatisation and renovation of 
nationwide healthcare infrastructure 
including both “bricks and mortar” 
buildings and medical equipment, 
replacing rundown Soviet-era facilities 
(of total nationwide hospital bed 
capacity, over 75% is new and only 
c.10% is in the public sector).
• Increased access to healthcare through 
the Universal Healthcare Programme, 
which has provided basic healthcare 
coverage to the entire population since

Universal healthcare programme
In March 2013, the UHC was introduced to 
address high private healthcare costs in 
Georgia. The UHC also supplemented and 
eventually replaced the existing two State 
Insurance Programmes (“SIPs”), making 
state-sponsored health coverage available 
on a significantly larger scale. The UHC is a 
Government-funded healthcare programme 
that provides basic healthcare coverage to 
the entire population, including more than 
two million people who had never held 
medical insurance and purchased 
healthcare services only on an out-of-
pocket basis. Unlike the preceding SIPs,  
the UHC is not an insurance product but  
an undertaking by the Government to 
reimburse healthcare providers directly for 
the delivery of treatment to patients. The 
programme is subject to certain limits and 
service and coverage exclusions, beyond 
which patients have to fund treatment on 
an out-of-pocket basis or rely on private 
medical insurance coverage. The key 
principles of the UHC are as follows:
• The UHC covers basic outpatient 
elective services, most emergency care 
services, and elective inpatient services, 
subject to certain limits.
• The UHC is fully financed by the 
Government from tax revenues and 
• Analysis by Frost & Sullivan suggests 
that the extension of the UHC to cover 
ambulatory care, amendments to 
pharmaceutical regulations and increasing 
healthcare awareness in Georgia are all 
likely to contribute to the growth in 
outpatient visits in the coming years.
• Double-digit growth in healthcare 
expenditure. Total healthcare 
expenditure in Georgia increased by 
almost seven times between 2000 and 
2012. However, on a per capita basis, 
healthcare spending remains low 
compared to certain emerging market 
peers (such as Thailand, Malaysia, UAE) 
pointing to further growth potential. At 
the same time, economic growth and 
rising disposable incomes of Georgian 
citizens, including in the regions outside 
Tbilisi, will also lead to higher spending 
on healthcare services, particularly in 
consideration of the potential growth of 
“top up” medical insurance to 
supplement basic UHC coverage and the 
increase of corporate medical insurance 
plans for employees. Improving facilities 
and standards have the potential to 
develop health tourism by attracting 
citizens of neighbouring countries and, 
conversely, retaining Georgians currently 
seeking treatment overseas.
• Rapidly growing healthcare services 
market. Historically high growth in the 
Georgian healthcare services market is 
expected to continue, supported by both 
the hospital and ambulatory clinic 
segments. Increasing health awareness 
and quality of services will lead to 
growth in demand for diagnostics. 
Between 2010 and 2013, the number of 
laboratory tests increased by 45%, from 
5.5 million to eight million. The number 
of advanced diagnostic tests, including 
medical imaging, is also increasing. In 
the same period, the number of 
Computer T omography (“CT”) 
examinations has grown by 38% to 
almost 40,000. There has also been a 
growing demand for surgery and, in 
particular, advanced procedures – the 
overall number of surgeries performed  
is increasing by 9% annually in Georgia, 
which illustrates the growing demand 
for (and greater ability to deliver) such 
surgeries. In 2013 alone, the number of 
hip and knee replacements increased by 
46% and the number of heart surgeries 
by 29%.
• Favourable demographics. The country 
has an ageing population, with an 
increasing proportion of its citizens aged 
over 60 who will require more frequent, 
better and prolonged treatments. 
Increasing incidence of certain lifestyle-
related diseases (in particular, 
hypertension, ischemic heart diseases, 
cerebrovascular diseases and diabetes) 
will also boost demand for medical care. 
In addition, healthy fertility rates will 
drive demand for obstetric and child 
care services.
administered by the Social Service 
Agency (“SSA ”) – a body under the 
Georgian Ministry of Labour, Health and 
Social Affairs). In most cases, 
beneficiaries have an annual limit of GEL 
15,000 for planned procedures. For 
emergency admissions, the limit is GEL 
15,000 per incident for all individuals, 
except those from certain socially 
vulnerable groups and children under six. 
For planned procedures, patients are 
required to obtain approval from the SSA 
prior to treatment. These thresholds limit 
the services that a patient can access 
and result in the need for co-payments by 
patients for elective services and certain 
emergency services. There is a maximum 
two-month waiting time to obtain 
approval for elective inpatient services.
• UHC beneficiaries are entitled to select 
any healthcare provider of their choice 
provided it is enrolled in the programme 
as a provider of the requested service.
• Any provider, whether private or state, is 
eligible to participate in the programme.

Overview
reimbursement paid by the SSA to the 
healthcare providers under the UHC differs 
depending on the type of service provided 
and the location of the facility (in some 
cases reimbursement rates are higher in 
Tbilisi than in the regions).
Recent initiative to amend UHC
Currently the Government is planning to 
initiate changes to existing UHC model. 
According to this initiative, UHC coverage 
for each citizen will be determined 
according to their individual annual income 
level. The citizens whose annual income is:
• more than GEL 40,000, are expected to 
be excluded from UHC coverage;
• between GEL 10,000 and GEL 40,000, 
are expected to be partially covered by 
UHC with co-payments; and
• below GEL 10,000, are expected to be 
fully covered by UHC, including certain 
list of medicines.
The new initiative is currently at a 
discussion stage and is aimed to come into 
force from June, 2017 . Implementation of 
this change may potentially expand private 
medical insurance market. 
Healthcare service gaps
Despite significant reforms to the Georgian 
healthcare system, a number of healthcare 
service gaps remain, particularly in relation 
to the medical equipment available and the 
laboratory services provided in Georgia. 
There are limited numbers of the following 
items of medical equipment: magnetic 
resonance imaging machines (only three 
units in West Georgia), linear accelerator 
units (only six units in Georgia), gamma 
knife units (only one unit in West Georgia), 
positron emission tomography computers 
(only one unit in Georgia) and cardiac 
catheterisation laboratories (limited 
availability outside of Tbilisi). There are also 
shortages in Georgia of the following 
equipment: laparoscopic instruments, 
equipment for interventional endoscopy 
including endoscopic retrograde 
cholangiopancreatography, microwave 
tissue ablation systems, arthroscopes, 
choledocoscopes, muscle reinnervation 
systems, intraoperative ultrasound probes, 
vacuum machines, Flowtron mechanical 
compression units and pH meter units.  
In addition, the Georgian healthcare system 
suffers from limited provision of the 
following laboratory services: no dedicated 
pathology laboratories for certain tests 
(samples are often sent abroad for testing), 
limited paediatric oncology services, limited 
rehabilitation services, no suitable In Vitro 
Fertilisation (“IVF”) other than GHG’s, no 
bone marrow transplant facilities, no 
molecular laboratories and no suitable 
genetic laboratories.
Outpatient care 
Outpatient encounters in Georgia 
are low at 4.0 a year, compared to 
the CIS average of 8.9 and European 
Region countries of 7 .5, according  
to WHO.
Neonatology 
Neonatal mortality was 60-80%  
of under five mortality during 
previous years, well above the 43% 
global average.
Laboratory services 
• Number of lab tests are still sent 
to laboratories abroad.
• Pathology service is outdated 
and 30 years behind average 
European level.
Paediatrics 
Biggest share in medical services 
import comes on paediatrics. While 
the culture of regular visits to the 
doctor at an early paediatric age is a 
favourable heritage from Soviet-
times, the organised and good quality 
supply of such services is scarce.
Cancer 
• Very low reported incidence levels.
• Malignant neoplasms incidence 
rate in Georgia is 140.3, 
compared to 543.7 in the EU, 
and the detection of over 30%  
of malignant neoplasms occur  
at stage IV.
Paediatric cardio surgery 
For almost 15 years, there was only 
one centre in Georgia that provided 
cardiology and cardiosurgery 
services for children. GHG opened 
its paediatric cardio surgery 
department in 2015, which is the 
second such facility in the country.
Maternity care 
• Highest number of caesarean 
among the former Soviet Union 
republics – 41 .4% of the total 
number of all deliveries in 2015.
• Maternal mortality ratio per live 
births three times higher in Georgia 
than in the European Region. 
Cardiology
• Hospitalisation rate per 100,000 
population that was 1,647 in 
2014, which is two-fold less than 
in CIS and EU countries. 
• Cardiovascular diseases 
represent 16.5% of deaths.
Emergency care 
• Emergency units simply did not 
exist in Georgia until several 
years ago. 
• Hospitals had to staff emergency 
units with over 15 different 
specialists, which decreased the 
quality and efficiency of the ER.
Critical care 
The lack of quality of care in a number 
of areas in the Georgian healthcare 
system puts strain on critical care 
units, resulting in unnecessarily high 
occupancy of critical care units and 
inefficiency of care of the healthcare 
system in Georgia.

Competitive landscape 
Both state and private healthcare providers (ambulatory clinics and 
hospitals) compete in the Georgian market, with private providers 
accounting for the vast majority of total supply in the country. 
The market is relatively fragmented, with the six largest 
competitors (all of which are private) accounting for only a third  
of the total number of beds. The top 15 participants control 58%  
of capacity. This may indicate further growth potential for both new 
and incumbent market participants through mergers and 
acquisitions. The ambulatory clinics market is even more 
fragmented and no competitor controls more than a 1% market 
share, with the Group’s own market share at 1 .5%, as of 
31 December 2016. Therefore it is likely that there will be further 
consolidation and the emergence of a large participant in the market 
via mergers and acquisitions.
Industry and market overview continued
Pharma market
The pharma market in Georgia was estimated to be worth  
GEL 1 .3 billion, which represents 38% of total healthcare spending 
in the country. The pharmaceutical market in Georgia was highly 
concentrated, with four major players, holding approximately 75% 
of the market share. After acquisition of the third and the fourth 
largest pharma players, GHG became the largest player on the 
pharma market and is now present in the whole Georgia healthcare 
ecosystem and maintains the leading position, with two main 
competitors in the pharma market: PSP and Aversi. Both pharma 
competitors are also presented in the hospital as well as medical 
insurance markets, with much smaller market shares than GHG. 
GHG therefore remains the only large player across all of these 
markets as the competitors have not managed so far to establish 
scalable businesses in the respective sectors.
Medical insurance market
As of 31 December 2016, c.543,000 voluntary medical insurance 
packages have been reported to the Insurance State Supervision 
Service of Georgia. For the past decade, the private insurance 
market expanded significantly compared to 2006 figure when only 
40,000 Georgian citizens (or c.1% of the total population) had a 
voluntary medical insurance package, most of which were provided 
as part of a corporate benefits programme. Growing awareness of 
the benefits of medical insurance among the population in Georgia 
may lead to greater demand for private medical insurance from 
employers and self-paying customers who seek better quality of 
services, quicker treatment or more advanced procedures than are 
covered within the UHC framework.

Overview
People development in our 
healthcare services business
We at GHG believe that investment in human capital and education 
is the most productive investment we can make. We made this 
area our top priority in 2014 and it will remain such for many years 
to come. Below we want to share our accomplishments in this area 
during 2016. 
Our Learning Centre
Throughout the year, our healthcare services business has 
coordinated internal training process through its Learning Centre 
(the “Centre”) founded in 2014. The Centre has two physical 
locations: one in Tbilisi that coordinates the learning process for 
hospitals located in the capital and another in Kutaisi that 
coordinates the learning process for regional hospitals. The Centre 
carries out the educational process for our medical as well as 
administrative personnel. 
Healthcare services training programmes are in line with our clinical 
development strategy and support main medical directions:  
nursing, internal medicine, Infection Control (“IC”), obstetrician-
gyneacology, emergency care, paediatrics and customer 
service excellence. 
In 2016, our focus was around the following programmes: 
• Nursing training with intensive five-month (106 hours) 
curriculum, tailored to meet nursing basic standards set in our 
healthcare services facilities. All of GHG’s existing nurses and 
newcomers are obliged to undergo the different modules of the 
course. The course is led by nurse-trainers who have been 
trained by the healthcare services nursing department. During 
2016, we carried out three different training modules for 2,299 
trainees and newcomers. We finished 2016 with 2,869 nurses 
employed at our healthcare facilities. 
• Internal medicine training is led by the Head of Internal 
Medicine Department and trainers. The course covers internal 
medicine fields, such as: respiratory system, cardiovascular 
system, gastroenterology, endocrine system, neurology, 
rheumatology, hematology, nephrology and urology. During 
2016, 433 doctors were trained.
• Infection control and prevention course is coordinated with 
the joint efforts of our healthcare facilities and the Centre for 
Diseases Control and Prevention (“CDC”) of the United States 
local representative office in south Caucasus. During 2016, 633 
trainees – nurses, epidemiology and infection control specialists 
completed the different modules of the course. 
• Customer service standards training is obligatory for all 
employees and new comers at our outpatient clinics and 
departments within hospitals. Employees who participate in this 
training are physicians, ambulatory nurses and patient registry 
specialists. During 2016, total of 565 participants were trained. 
Apart from training given at our learning centre facilities, we sent 
our doctors for internships and study tours at leading European 
hospitals. For example, in 2016 two employees were sent to 
Warsaw, Poland’s, “Centrum Zdrowia Dzecka” hospital for a 
two-month study tour, practicing children liver and renal 
replacement therapy. 
Implementation of those services is expected to start at the Iashvili 
Tertiary Referral Hospital in 2017 .
As Georgia’s healthcare services industry was only recently 
privatised, the whole industry is in need of investment into the 
development of medical personnel, including the doctors and 
nurses, as well as support technicians and moreover, commercially-
minded managers running the healthcare facilities.  18 
Georgia Healthcare Group PLC  Annual Report 2016  Strategic report
Residency programme
In line with our strategy to develop a new generation of doctors,  
we launched residency programmes in a number of fields, 
including: paediatrics, neonatology, children’s emergency care, 
children’s neurology, anesthesiology and intensive care, laboratory 
medicine, obstetrics and gynaecology, children’s cardio and 
rheumatology, radiology, general surgery, traumatology/orthopedics, 
children’s surgery, internal medicine, endocrinology, children’s 
endocrinology, oncology, radiation oncology, children’s 
gastroenterology, neurosurgery, plastic and reconstruction surgery. 
These programmes are particularly important to source specialists 
in the fields where we have a shortage of doctors. The goal is to 
have medical specialists with high quality education and skills in 
most deficient fields in three years’ time. Since the launch of the 
programme in December 2015, we have received 557 applications 
from prospective residents. Currently we have 58 talented 
residents involved in 12 specialties. 
To incentivise and support top talent to enroll in our residency 
programme, we offer grants, student loans and employment after 
graduating from our residency program (post-graduation, they  
are required to work at GHG healthcare facilities for at least  
three years). 
By the end of 2016, we received accreditations in seven additional 
fields with a total number of slots for admission of 65 residents 
over three years, bringing the total number of fields to 20 and a 
total number of slots for admission to 234. For 2017 , we announced  
110 slots for admission and received more than 400 applications:
People development continued
Developing a new generation of nurses and doctors is high on

Nurse college
We are investing in the development of two major hospitals in 
Tbilisi, as well as expanding our ambulatory clinics and investing  
in new services to fill the existing service gaps in Georgia. 
We initiated and facilitated the opening of a joint Nurse College  
at David Tvildiani Medical University, a leading medical institution  
in Georgia. The college has an accreditation with a total number  
of slots for admission of 150 students, over three years. 60 of the 
most talented students were enrolled in October 2016 as a result  
of a rigorous application process. They will be trained according to 
international curricula to acquire necessary nursing knowledge  
and skills. The training course lasts for three years. 
Also in 2016 we signed an exclusivity contract with the largest 
nursing college “Panatsea” (with a total number of slots for 
admission of 600 students over three years) – all the students 
graduating from the college will practice at our healthcare facilities. 
This is one of the oldest and most popular nursing colleges in 
Georgia. In 2017 the college plans to open branches in the Kakheti 
and Samtskhe-Javakheti regions where nursing colleges do not 
exist and our healthcare facilities have strong need of nurses.
GHG provides grants to the most successful candidates, offers 
student loans and employment to the graduates for a minimum  
of three years. These schemes are critical for us to partially address 
the country’s shortage of nurses and we expect to recruit a majority 
of our nurses from this newly opened college in the medium to 
long term. 19

Leadership programme
In 2016, we launched a leadership programme for middle level 
managers. 25 managers started a five-month management course 
designed by the Bank of Georgia University, which is one of the top 
universities in Georgia. In 2017 , we aim to have an additional 50 
managers enrolled in this leadership programme. 
We plan to provide more leadership development opportunities  
to our middle management in 2017 , including study tours and 
internships in foreign hospitals.
Continuous Medical Education (“CME”)
At our healthcare services facilities, we conduct more than ten 
national CME accredited short courses, out of which two post-
graduate programmes, paediatric ER and family medicine, were 
accredited by the Ministry of Healthcare in 2016. Our CME 
programme included Fundamental Critical Care Support (“FCCS”) 
which was delivered by Mayo Clinic experts through two years 
training of our in-house trainers. Now we have the unique capacity 
to deliver FCCS to medical personal on a national scale in Georgia. 
On-the-job training for healthcare services  
medical personnel
To further advance and develop our healthcare services personnel, 
from 2014 we started the process of inviting experienced doctors, 
working abroad, to conduct on-the-job trainings at our healthcare 
facilities. The doctors lead several key medical services at our 
hospitals and simultaneously provide on-the-job training for local 
specialists. Some of them are Georgian nationals, repatriated and 
eager to participate in development of medical services in Georgia. 
At Kutaisi Regional Referral Hospital, where we operate one of  
the largest Oncology Centres in the country, a number of on-the-job 
training programmes were conducted. Since its opening in 2015, 
the local team worked and received high quality on-the-job trainings 
from the team of the following experienced doctors working 
abroad: Dr Krystyna Danuta Kiel – radiation oncologist from Rush 
University Medical Centre, Chicago IL; Mr Gocha Khelashvili – 
medical physicist from Northwestern Memorial Hospital Chicago, 
IL; and Dr Zaza Ujmajuridze medical and radiation oncologist from 
University Hospital Region Zealand and University Hospital 
Copenhagen, Denmark.
Another successful case of foreign doctors’ involvement to develop 
national specialists and improve the quality of care throughout the 
country was at Iashvili Paediatric Tertiary Referral Hospital, where 
the local team from the children’s cardiac surgery department  
were trained by a team of Italian colleagues led by Dr Paata 
Kalandadze, a cardiac surgeon from “The Heart of Children” ,  
in Bergamo, Italy. 
Furthermore, the first liver transplantation in Georgia was 
performed in Batumi Regional Referral Hospital by the team  
of surgeons trained and supported by Indian transplant surgeon 
Dr Sanjay Kumar Goja from Medanta Institute of Liver 
Transplantation and Regenerative Medicine Deli, in Gurgaon, India. 
In 2016 at the Caraps Speciality Referral Hospital (“Caraps 
Medline”), an upscale boutique hospital of the Group particularly 
renowned for gynaecology and plastic surgery services in Georgia, 
we launched an in vitro fertilisation service. A distinguished 
embryologist from Turkey, Dr Unal Suat who has 20 years’ 
experience, was invited to set up the service at Caraps Medline 
with the objective to develop a local team of embryologists. 
Investment in people development
In total, GHG’s healthcare services business invested GEL 2.0

A vertically integrated 
care pathway
Our well-established hospital network allows a seamless patient treatment 
pathway from local doctors to multi-profile hospitals whilst the pharma 
and medical insurance businesses play a feeder role in originating and 
directing patients.
We operate a highly-integrated patient capture business model.  
Our ambulatory clinics and hospitals are organised in specific 
geographic clusters to provide services to the broadest range  
of patients with:
• ambulatory clinics offering outpatient services;
• community hospitals offering broader outpatient and a range  
of multi-profile inpatient healthcare services; and
• referral hospitals offering a comprehensive range of complex 
and specialist services.
The referral hierarchy within each geographic cluster provides 
patients with a complete treatment pathway, from local physicians 
via ambulatory clinics and community hospitals to referral hospitals, 
optimising utilisation of our facilities and medical personnel.  
Our specialist ambulances help to achieve this by facilitating the 
movement of patients between hospitals. While we provide most 
basic (“primary”) medical and surgical procedures at all of our 
facilities, the majority of more specialised or advanced 
(“secondary” and “tertiary”) interventional and surgical procedures 
are concentrated at our regional referral hospitals.
Our pharma business solidifies our strategic goal to have a strong 
presence across the healthcare eco-system. Following the 
completion of the two major pharma acquisitions in May 2016 and 
in January 2017 , we became the largest pharmacy chain in the 
country with c.29% market share, which should help us to grow 
our ambulatory business, where we hold only 1 .5% market share. 
The pharma business enhances GHG’s existing “patient capture” 
business model through its strong customer loyalty franchise with 
over two million monthly customer interactions and 0.5 million 
members of its loyalty programme, and is expected to drive 
additional referrals to GHG’s ambulatory clinics. Furthermore, the 
pharma business is a pure out-of-pocket business and it helps us 
further diversify our revenues. The pharma business strengthens 
GHG’s position as the major purchaser of pharmaceutical products  
in Georgia. 
Our medical insurance business also plays a feeder role in 
originating and directing patient traffic to our healthcare facilities. 
Customers insured by us may also use the services of competitor 
healthcare facilities. However, we are pleased that in a system 
where patients have free choice of providers to see so many 
choosing the high-quality services in our ambulatory network.  
Other reasons insurance customers prefer to use our hospitals and 
ambulatory clinics are co-payment incentives and direct settlement 
of claims. Our clinics are directly paid by our medical insurance 
business whilst patients must pay for and seek reimbursement for 
most medical care provided by other healthcare providers. 
Our pharma and medical insurance businesses are becoming 
increasingly synergistic, through cross-sales, consolidated 
discounts and an increasing claims retention ratio within the Group.

hospitals are located in regional towns and municipalities and provide basic outpatient and 
inpatient diagnostic, surgical and treatment services to the local population. They also refer 
patients to referral hospitals for secondary or tertiary level treatment. Our community hospitals 
had a 22.9% bed utilisation, reflecting their role as primary healthcare providers and generated 9% 
of our total healthcare services revenue in 2016. The EBITDA margin for our community hospitals 
for 2016 was 29.9%.

Ambulances facilitate the  
movement of patients to and 
 between our hospitals
Ambulances
We operate 25 regular and 54 specialised ambulance vehicles (specialised ambulances are 
equipped with intensive care equipment and have medics on-board). Our ambulances play a feeder 
role for our hospitals, as they facilitate the movement of patients to and between our hospitals, 
improving utilisation of our facilities and medical personnel. We are investing in more specialist 
ambulances and staff to enhance our patient referral services.

Ambulatory clinics
We operate ten ambulatory clusters consisting of 13 district ambulatory clinics and 28 express 
ambulatory clinics that provide basic and full scale outpatient diagnostic and treatment services. 
These clinics are located in Tbilisi and major regional cities. Ambulatory clinics generate the highest 
margin and management currently believes that this segment of our business will become one of 
the largest source of future growth. Our ambulatory clinics business generated 5% of our total 
healthcare services revenue in 2016, up from 3% in 2015. Because of the new ambulatory clinics 
roll-outs the EBITDA margin stood at 15.1% in 2016.

Pharmacies
243
Pharmacies, 27 of which are  
located in our healthcare facilities.
We operate the country’s largest pharma retail and wholesale business consisting of 243 
pharmacies as of January 2017 . We are also the largest retailer in the country. We operate two 
pharmacy brands, each with distinct positioning: GPC (acquired May 2016) – for the higher-end 
customer segment and Pharmadepot (acquired January 2017) – for the mass retail segment. The 
pharmacies are located in Tbilisi and other major regional cities. Our pharma business has over two 
million monthly customer interactions and 0.5 million members of its loyalty programme. The 
EBITDA margin for our pharma business was 4.3% in 2016.
Medical insurance
61.5
Million GEL revenue  
generated by medical insurance  
business in 2016
We are the largest medical insurance provider in Georgia with a wide distribution network. We offer a 
variety of medical insurance products. We had approximately 211,000 customers as at 31 December 
2016. We offer a wide range of comprehensive private medical insurance policies that customers can 
opt for instead of relying on the coverage provided under the UHC and other state-funded healthcare 
programmes and have introduced products that “top up” or supplement the UHC coverage. Our 
products are offered as corporate packages to large employers and standalone policies for self-paying 
individuals. We have been adjusting the business model of our medical insurance business since 2013 
when UHC transformed the landscape. While it suffered a loss in 2016, the business plays an 
important feeder role for healthcare services and pharma, and we believe that the business is turning 
the corner. Medical insurance generated GEL 61 .5 million of revenue in 2016, comprising 14% of our 
total revenue and negative 2% of our total EBITDA. We operate 17 branches and service centres of 
our medical insurance business located in a number of cities and towns across Georgia.

GHG owns a 67% equity stake in the combined 
pharma business. The remaining 33% minority 
stake is owned by ABC’s existing two individual 
shareholders.
In May 2016, GHG acquired 100% of the issued share capital 
of JSC GPC, the third largest pharmaceutical retailer and 
wholesaler in Georgia with a 15% market share by 2015 
revenue. GPC is an urban-retailer, operates with a 
countrywide distribution network of 118 pharmacies,  
of which 20 pharmacies are located at GHG’s healthcare 
facilities. 25 of these pharmacies also have express 
ambulatory clinics. Para-pharmacies represented 33% of 
GPC retail revenues in 2016. No other pharmaceutical player 
on Georgian market has similar diversification of revenues.
In January 2017 , GHG also acquired JSC ABC, the fourth 
largest pharmaceutical retailer and wholesaler in Georgia, 
with a marker share of 14% by 2015 revenues. As a result, 
GHG became the largest pharma player with c.29% market 
share by 2015 revenues. ABC focuses on a mass market 
pharmacy model, with a countrywide distribution network of 
125 pharmacies across Georgia and operates under the brand 
name Pharmadepot. Seven of these pharmacies are located 
at GHG’s healthcare facilities. 
We have kept both brands, GPC and Pharmadepot, as they 
have a distinct positioning in two types of customer 
segments: GPC for the higher-end customer segment and 
Pharmadepot for the mass retail segment. GHG owns a 67% 
equity stake in the combined pharmaceutical business and 
the remaining 33% minority stake is owned by two ABC’s 
existing main shareholders.
These transactions further underpin GHG’s expansion 
strategy and its aim to be leading the integrated player in the 
Georgian healthcare ecosystem with an aggregate market 
value of GEL 3.4 billion. Following the acquisitions GHG 
became the largest purchaser of pharmaceutical products  
in Georgia, with a platform which offers significant synergy 
potential. Moreover, the combined pharma business is the 
largest retailer in the country, with over two million customer 
interactions per month through over 240 pharmacies. This 
provides GHG with a strong platform, with 29% share of the 
pharma market, to capitalise on the GEL 1 .3 billion Georgian 
pharmaceuticals market, which represents 38% of total 
healthcare spending in the country. The combined pharma 
business does not require significant ongoing capex 
investments, and is therefore expected to generate strong 
free cash flow. We started consolidating ABC’s financial 
results from January 2017 .

The pharma business acquisitions have a strong strategic fit 
with GHG’s existing business model and are expected to be 
earnings accretive from day one. 
Strong presence across the healthcare eco-system is our 
strategic goal. We hold 23% market share in hospital 
business and 35% market share in medical insurance 
business, after these acquisitions we became the largest 
pharmacy chain in the country with c.29% market share, 
which should help us to grow and realise revenue synergies 
in the more profitable ambulatory business, where we hold 
only 1 .5% market share. These transactions enhance GHG’s 
existing “patient capture” business model through its strong 
customer loyalty franchise implying over two million monthly 
customer interactions and 0.5 million members of the loyalty 
programme, which is expected to be enhanced by the clients 
of the combined pharma business. In addition, the pharma 
business is expected to drive additional referrals to GHG’s 
ambulatory clinics.
The other positive factors include:
1) These transactions are earnings accretive from day one as 
we leverage on scale to extract cost synergies: GEL 11 .8 
million on an annualised basis at EBITDA level expected 
from ABC’s and GPC’s merger, within a year following the 
ABC’s acquisition and GEL 6.7 million on an annualised 
basis achieved from GPC.
2) We will further diversify our revenues and the pharma 
retail business is expected to contribute c.30% of GHG’s 
EBITDA next year.
3) With this acquisition, we will be bringing on board the 
best of GPC and ABC management teams in pharma 
retail business. 28

referral hospitals
Currently GHG operates with 15 referral hospitals, seven located in Tbilisi 
and eight in other regional cities. Referral hospitals provide comprehensive 
range of complex and specialist services, including secondary or tertiary 
level outpatient and inpatient diagnostic, surgical and treatment services. 
The seven Tbilisi hospitals have been acquired since 2013 when we started 
our strategy to target acquisitions in Tbilisi to increase our market share 
and bed capacity countrywide.
1. HTMC 
High Technology Medical Centre University Clinic (“HTMC”) is a 
major and well-established referral hospital in Tbilisi. It is also the 
single largest hospital in Georgia, providing a wide range of 
inpatient and outpatient services, including the largest department 
of oncology radiotherapy in Georgia. Its wide range of inpatient 
services include diagnostics and interventional radiology, radiation 
therapy, endovascular surgery, cardiac surgery, neuro surgery, 
dialysis, traumatology and orthopedic surgery. Together with 
comprehensive surgical treatment, it operates an emergency 
department, serving acute care patient flows. HTMC serves as one 
of the main referral hospitals for the Kakheti region, in East Georgia.
We acquired HTMC Hospital in August 2015.
2. Deka Referral Hospital 
Deka Referral Hospital (“Deka”) has a strong historic reputation  
and a prime location in North-East Tbilisi. We acquired Deka in June 
2015 to continue our expansion into Tbilisi and to capitalise on the 
development of an under-utilised hospital. We started a substantial 
renovation of the unrefurbished Soviet-era hospital, in January 2016. 
The full renovation and launch of the hospital is expected to be 
completed in the second half of 2017 . Following the completion of 
the renovation, the 320-bed Deka hospital will serve as a first level 
flagship hospital, being the first choice hospital for safe and quality 
elective medical care countrywide. The hospital will provide 
full-scale services for general and oncological surgery, oncology 
(including chemotherapy), vascular and cardiac surgery and 
orthopedic surgery. The hospital will also offer rehabilitation care 
and a variety of day care services.
In September 2016, we launched the first department at Deka, 
which is one of the largest outpatient and diagnostic centres in 
the country.

3. Sunstone Referral Hospital 
Sunstone Referral Hospital (“Sunstone”) was acquired in May 2014 
to capitalise on the development of an under-utilised hospital. We 
started renovation of this Soviet-era amortised hospital, in January 
2016. The first phase of renovation – 220 beds, is already completed 
and we launched the hospital in April 2017 , two months ahead of 
the initial schedule. The full launch of the 332-bed Sunstone hospital 
is planned by the end of 2017 , in line with the expected increasing 
demand. The hospital will serve as a third level referral hospital for 
the Eastern Tbilisi population and will become East Georgia’s 
referral centre. Together with acute and elective paediatric and adult 
healthcare services, the hospital will serve as an excellence centre 
for hepatic and kidney transplantation countrywide.  29

Overview
At Iashvili Paediatric Tertiary Referral Hospital we are focused on 
growth through the enhancement of existing, and the provision of 
additional, complex secondary and tertiary services, with a focus on 
neonatal and paediatric care. In 2015, we established a department 
for neonatal and paediatric cardiac surgical care, expanded the

paediatric neurosurgery department, invested in upgrades of 
existing equipment and recruited additional physicians. 
We acquired Iashvili Paediatric Tertiary Referral Hospital in 
February 2014. 
4.  Iashvili Paediatric T ertiary Referral Hospital
Iashvili Paediatric Tertiary Referral Hospital (“Iashvili”), located in 
Tbilisi, is the cornerstone of our neonatal and paediatric services, 
and offers one of the most comprehensive portfolio of such 
services in Georgia. Iashvili Paediatric Tertiary Referral Hospital has 
a strong reputation for neonatal and paediatric services in Georgia 
among both physicians and patients, as reflected in the volume of 
referrals from other healthcare facilities and the occupancy rates.  
It was partially renovated in 2011 and equipped with new 
medical equipment.  
The hospital primarily caters to residents of Tbilisi, but also serves 
as a major referral hospital for specialised services and tertiary care 
for neonatology and paediatric services for patients throughout 
Georgia. It offers a full range of medical and surgical specialities to 
outpatients and inpatients, as well as 24-hour emergency services.

extension of Iashvili Paediatric Tertiary Referral Hospital to capture 
the increased flow of neonatal and paediatric patients in Tbilisi. It 
currently serves as the main emergency centre for children and the 
hospital offers a full range of conservative and surgical services. 
Children’s New Referral Hospital also offers inpatient and outpatient 
services for children with diabetes and rare genetic diseases. 
We acquired Children’s New Referral Hospital in February 2014. 
8. Kutaisi Regional Referral Hospital
Kutaisi Regional Referral Hospital, located in Kutaisi – the second 
largest city in Georgia – opened its doors in 2007 . It is the 
cornerstone facility of our operations in west Georgia. While the 
hospital primarily caters to Kutaisi, it also serves as a major referral 
hospital for specialised services and tertiary care for all regions in 
west Georgia. It also serves as a referral centre for our community 
hospitals located in Terjola, Tkubuli, Tskaltubo and Khoni. It offers one 
of the most comprehensive portfolio of services in this part of the 
country, including the full range of outpatient and inpatient medical 
and surgical specialties as well as 24-hour emergency room services 
for any age group, and has a strong reputation (based on feedback 
from patients and physicians, including follow-up calls performed by 
our call centre) for intensive care, cardiology (interventional and 
cardio surgery), angiology, urology, gynaecology and diagnostics.  
It offers the widest range of secondary and tertiary neonatal and 
paediatric services in the region. In addition, it has departments for 
dialysis, mammography and histopathology as well as a blood bank. 
It was the first hospital to introduce a hypothermia service in west 
Georgia and the first to introduce computed tomography and 
magnetic resonance imaging for diagnostics, interventional 
cardiology services and cardio surgery in west Georgia. The Imereti 
referral laboratory that serves the rest of our Imereti healthcare 
facilities is also located here. The laboratory has obtained 
International Organisation for Standardisation (“ISO”) 9001:2008 
certification, accreditation awarded from the International 
Organisation for Standardisation in January 2014. 
We constructed the hospital in 2011 . We launched the West Georgia 
oncology centre at the same site in June 2015.
6. Caraps Specialty Referral Hospital
Caraps Specialty Referral Hospital, located in Tbilsi, is a high-end 
specialty hospital, established by a private investor in 1998 and 
moved to its current location in 2012. The hospital focuses on 
plastic and reconstructive surgery, as well as oncology surgery, 
angiology, gynaecology, ophthalmology, orthopaedics and medical 
radiology. In 2016, we launched IVF at Caraps Medline. IVF is 
undeveloped in Georgia and patients generally have to travel abroad 
for this service. The immediate goal for GHG is to serve those 
patients that currently travel abroad for IVF service.
We acquired Caraps Specialty Referral Hospital in December 2013. 
7 . Tbilisi T raumatology Hospital 
Tbilisi Traumatology Hospital, is mainly focused on adult acute care 
services. The hospital represents the third referral level for trauma 
patients countrywide and offers high technology, sophisticated 
services in trauma surgery, angio surgery, neuro surgery and critical 
care medicine. Tbilisi Traumatology Hospital also offers a wide range 
of orthopedic and reconstructive surgical services.

Kutaisi Emergency Referral Hospital is located in the centre of Kutaisi 
and has been operating since 2012. It is another cornerstone facility  
of our Imereti operations as it captures most of the region’s 
emergency patient traffic. It also serves as a referral centre for our 
community hospitals located in Terjola, Tkubuli, Tskaltubo and Khoni.  
It offers the best emergency service in the region and has a strong 
reputation among patients. The state-owned ambulance service 
delivers most of the Imereti region’s emergency patients to the 
hospital. Accordingly, services are focused on the emergency 
department, a surgery department with a general surgery line and 
several specialised surgery lines, an intensive care department,  
a conservative care department (for care designed to avoid radical 
medical therapeutic measures or operative procedures), including  
a stroke unit, ophthalmology, cardiology and complementary 
laboratory and medical radiology diagnostics services. 
We built the Kutaisi Regional Referral Hospital to replace the large 
scale Soviet-era Imereti Regional Emergency Hospital, which ceased 
to operate after the new facility was launched in the spring of 2012.

Claims retained

GHG has full presence in the Georgian healthcare ecosystem  
and our long-term growth strategy is focused on increasing our 
profitability while achieving a one-third market share by both 
number of beds and revenue in hospital business, achieving 15% 
market share in ambulatory business, retaining at least one-third 
market share in our medical insurance and gaining a one-third 
market share in our pharma businesses. We believe that the 
implementation of the UHC in Georgia (which provides basic 
healthcare coverage to the entire population), the highly-fragmented 
nature of the healthcare services market (whereby the top six 
providers control only approximately 40% of the market by number 
of beds, as of 31 December 2016) and existing service gaps in both 
the hospital and ambulatory segments have created significant 
potential for expansion and market share gains for us, through 
organic growth and acquisitions. GHG’s strategy from 2015 through 
2018 is simple: at least doubling 2015 healthcare services revenue 
by 2018, increasing pharma EBITDA margin and improving medical 
insurance profitability by driving loss and combined ratio down and 
retaining more claims within the Group.

Key performance indicators
Returns KPIs
Diversified revenue sources across healthcare facilities and medical 
insurance, a growing number of healthcare facilities and an enhanced 
service mix as well as entering the pharma market, were the main 
drivers of the exceptional results in terms of profitability in 2016.
The improving EBITDA margin is a function of our scale and focus 
on efficiencies and reflects in particular the substantial growth in 
Tbilisi during 2016, reflecting higher utilisation levels in our 
healthcare facilities in the capital. The contribution of acquired 
healthcare facilities in 2015, strong margins, improving cost 
efficiency and consolidating pharma results since May 2016 
translated into a 117 .8% normalised
1
 (excluding one-off items) 
growth in profit.
Growth KPIs
The record revenue of GEL 426.4 million for full year 2016 was 
primarily driven by pharma business consolidation GPC since its 
acquisition in May 2016 and the 26.2% growth in our healthcare 
services revenue, of which 16.3% was organic.
In 2017 and beyond, we will continue to focus on profitable revenue 
growth, which we expect will driven by a combination of organic 
growth and the integration of recently acquired hospitals, mainly 
focusing on Tbilisi and increase our market share in the fast-
growing, highly fragmented and under penetrated outpatient 
market; investing in medical equipment, utilising existing service 
gaps, particularly in oncology, high-tech diagnostics, laboratory  
and specialist services; continuing to lead the market in the  
quality of our medical care; driving margin improvements through 
operational efficiency and utilisation levels in our facilities; 
consolidating combined pharma business (GPC – since May 2016, 
ABC – since 1Q 2017); and maintaining our existing market share 
in medical insurance.
Our KPIs for 2016 reflect a strong performance our healthcare services and 
medical insurance businesses and demonstrate excellent organic growth with 
improving margins; our medical insurance business is in turnaround mode.

non-recurring gain due to deferred tax adjustments and one-off currency 
translation loss.
2  Normalised earnings per share (“Normalised EPS”) is calculated as normalised profit 
(profit for the period attributable to shareholders“adjusted for one-off items as 
explained in ”footnote 1”), divided by the weighted average number of shares 
outstanding during the same period.
3 Relatively large EPS in 2014 was caused by much smaller number of shares 
outstanding in 2014 year. Number of shares outstanding increased by 352.4%,  
from 28,334,829 in 2014 to 128,181,820 after IPO in 2015.
4 Normalised return on average total equity (“Normalised ROAE”) is calculated  
as normalised profit (profit for the period attributable to shareholders adjusted for 
one-off items as explained in “footnote 1”), divided by average equity attributable  
to shareholders for the same period net of unutilised portion of IPO proceeds.
5 The amount represents gross revenue before corrections and rebates (see financial 
statements, Note 3). Revenue net of corrections and rebates was GEL 423.8 million  
in 2016 (2015: GEL 242.4 million, 2014: GEL 199.2 million). 53

Efficiency KPIs
The combined effect of the increasing share of referral hospitals  
in our revenue mix, together with increasing the number of 
ambulatory clinics, entering the pharma market and stabilising our 
medical insurance, together with the integration activities carried 
out throughout 2016 to the healthcare facilities acquired during 
2014 and 2015 and pharma business in 2016, are the main drivers 
of efficiency strategy for our business. Other measures such as 
various investments in IT aimed at optimisation of workflow 
processes and implementation of centralised cost administration 
represent the cost control measures we continue to deploy across 
the board. Since the pharma business acquisition (“GPC”) in May 
2016, we have already realised GEL 6.7 million cost synergies 
while the initial guidance was total GEL 4.9 million. From ABC 
integration activates we expect total cost synergies GEL 11 .8 
million to be realised in 2017 .

Resources and 
Responsibilities
By implementing evidence-based, modern approaches and scientific 
methodologies in quality management, we satisfy our patients’ needs  
and deliver a solid financial performance. Our employees play a crucial 
role, in our success and as a consequence a key part of our ongoing 
strategy is to attract and retain the best qualified medical personnel  
and to constantly develop them in line with international best practices.
Resources and responsibilities
The concept of sustainability lies at the heart of our business and 
reflects our contribution to sustainable development – development 
that meets the needs of the present without compromising the 
ability of future generations to meet their own needs. Our 
sustainability agenda allows us to be profitable as well as 
environmentally and socially responsible at the same time. We  
are pioneering sustainability practices in our operations and are 
constantly seeking new ways to improve our performance. 
GHG is the largest private healthcare services provider in the 
Georgian market. The Group operates a network of medical  
centres and hospitals through its healthcare services business.  
Our services cover more than 75% of the Georgian population  
with clinics located across the country providing access to 
high-quality medical services including to those living in remote 
mountain regions. Accessibility to such medical services is  
ensured by scheduling regular visits by specialists to small  
towns and villages and by providing patients with transportation  
to larger clinics in urgent cases and in cases when more 
sophisticated treatment is required.
 
The healthcare services business of GHG also provides free regular 
medical examinations at various locations throughout the country 
including Batumi, Khulo, Keda, Shuakhevi, Poti, Kvareli, Telavi and 
others. In addition, GHG’s specialists deliver free medical services, 
including examinations and treatments for the socially and 
economically disadvantaged members of the population. In 
cooperation with other healthcare institutions, Georgia Healthcare 
Group arranges free blood transportation and donations for 
its patients.
Furthermore, healthcare services business of GHG provides free 
medical check-ups at ambulatory clinics and referral hospitals.  
It also runs a wide range of charitable activities on a permanent 
basis for children with leukaemia.
Quality matters
Ensuring a high quality of medical care is essential for the Georgian 
Healthcare Group. Changes to our management team and a new 
business strategy initiated a number of fundamental changes to  
the way we approach the quality of our services. We are striving to 
build an effective model of quality management based on patients’ 
preferences, evidence-based medicine and scientific methodology. 
We have adopted a quality management programme and developed 
a more consistent organisational structure for systematic quality 
assessment. We also constantly collaborate with international 
healthcare organisations and local medical schools to discuss  
and define the most up-to-date healthcare quality principles.
Quality management
Since 2015, we have created a Quality Management Programme 
that relies on modern approaches to quality matters in healthcare. 
The main goal of the programme is to form a new quality 
management framework based on methodical and comprehensive 
assessment of clinical practices. During the reporting period, we 
defined the programme’s goals and strategies and developed the 
main working policies in accordance with national regulations and 
international best practices. In 2017 , we will endeavour to ensure 
that sophisticated quality measures and indicators will be employed 
and our quality management framework adhered to, in every 
network clinic. 
To manage the programme we work in committees as well as in 
working units, both of which will operate at local and head 
office levels.
Committees
We have defined the main functions of committees in respect of 
the quality management programme: 
• identification of key quality and safety measures for hospitals; 
• the provision of key recommendations for improvement based 
on analysis of quality metrics throughout the network; and 
• trend observation and programmes approval. 
We started with the head office and a few clinics but in the future 
committees will be formed for all referral hospitals. We anticipate 
that the committees of these referral hospitals will meet at least 
twice a year. At community hospitals, a chief clinical officer will 
cover quality management activities.
Working units
Our working units are responsible for the execution of defined 
quality management goals and objectives. They collect medical  
data in hospitals and carry out their own analysis for increased 
centralised reporting. Prior to 2015, there was only one single 
re-designed working unit responsible for all our hospitals’ quality 
management and it only operated at a head office level. In 2015,  
we made it our goal to re-design the working units within each  
of our hospitals in order to allow us to focus on proper quality 
management at a local level. By the end of 2016, we had a total  
of 47 professionals in all our existing working units: five of them  
in our head office, 29 in regional referral hospitals and 13 in  
other hospitals.
Furthermore, in order to adjust the working units to their new 
functions we revised their existing structures, re-defined staff 
positions as well as responsibilities and job descriptions. Now  
each working unit has a chief quality officer, a junior quality  
control specialist, an epidemiologist and a nurse specialising  
in the prevention of hospital infection. 55

Strategy
Working units are actively involved in other clinical standardisation 
processes relating to:
• optimisation of patient, information, medical and non-medical 
documentation flows;
• development of clinical protocols and standard operating 
procedures in hospitals; and
• the standardisation of billing and price processes.
Occasionally the units participate in other cross-functional and 
special projects. For instance, they set safety criteria for the 
expansion of hospitals in terms of infection control, patient safety, 
design and facility requirements for the Kutaisi Oncology Centre.
Databases
We understand that effective quality management can only be 
based on the monitoring of reliable indicators. Creating our own 
adequate Group-wide database has therefore been one of our 
major priorities. We have put mechanisms in place that allow us  
to routinely monitor core clinical activities. We have already 
established databases which set core quality and safety indicators 
for our units with the highest risk (“ICU” , Neonatal Intensive Care 
Unit (“NICU”), Paediatric Intensive Care Unit (“PICU”)). We have 
also created databases containing information on mortalities, 
penalties, medical errors and case reviews. An effective mechanism 
for providing reporting and feedback is also in the process of 
being created.
Quality standards
We strongly believe that for better quality management we need  
to standardise our clinical and administrative practices. We use both 
national guidelines and recommendations offered by international 
professional organisations as a base for standardisation. In 2014, 
we signed a memorandum of collaboration with the JCI, an 
accreditation institution for health care entities with high patient 
safety and quality standards. We have also closely cooperated with 
JCI experts to develop internal regulations, measures and indicators  
in accordance with its standards. Furthermore we have put in place 
additional quality improvements for antibiotic therapy for obstetric 
patients. We are continuously collecting information through our 
data collection system, which will serve as the basis for further 
analysis of our clinical practice.
The main objectives of our Quality Management Programme are to:
• implement quality methodologies, quality principles and quality 
management systems;
• apply a scientific approach to quality management;
• adopt inter-disciplinary approaches to problem solving and 
encouragement of team working;
• implement an unified approach to quality improvement 
consisting of: planning, development, implementation, 
measurement and analysis; and
• understand patient expectations and exceed them.

Centrally, we create protocols and pathways for our physicians  
and nurses based on the best national and international  
guidelines. These protocols and pathways serve as a tool for  
the standardisation of the basic processes related to our clinical 
activities. In order to track the adoption of and effectiveness of 
adjusted processes we perform selective clinical audits. In 2016, 
we conducted audits of activities related to radiation safety (in 13 
hospitals), TB prevention (in 13 hospitals), sterilisation units (in four 
hospitals), laundry units (two corporation units and one outsource 
facility) and an audit of our APACHE scores in five of our hospitals.
Infection control and prevention
Our healthcare facilities host a large number of people every day 
and it is essential to protect our patients, visitors and personnel 
from healthcare-associated infections. We enhance our patients’ 
safety by integrating effective infection prevention and control 
practices into our everyday clinical practice.
We conduct relevant training to equip our staff with hands-on 
experience and educate them on all new procedures and policies. 
This training has already been completed by the staff in a number 
of our ICUs head nurses and IC nurses.
Independent medical case review process
The independent medical case review process is designed to reveal 
systemic problems and to enhance preventive measures in our 
clinical practice. We have different case reviewing processes in 
place for: medical errors, mortality, sentinel events and near-miss 
cases. We collect all necessary information on each case, including 
the results of root cause analyses in order to develop appropriate 
response strategies.
In 2016, we designed a new medical case review process in our 
head office and in five major regional referral hospitals. Using this 
review process, we discuss recommendations for improvements 
with medical staff, then we supervise the improvement processes  
in our hospitals. We will further roll this process out throughout our 
network of hospitals and we also intend to organise our own 
training courses in near-miss review methodology. 
Employee matters
Each of our employees plays his/her role in the delivery of quality 
healthcare services and is an integral part of the Group’s success.  
We are rapidly expanding our healthcare operations and our headcount 
is growing accordingly. In 2016, the number of our employees 
increased by more than 3,000 bringing our total number to 12,811 
people, making us the largest private healthcare employer in 
Georgia. In order to satisfy the growing needs of our business it  
is our first priority to attract, retain and develop the best qualified 
professionals.
In 2016, the Group entered the pharmaceutical market through the 
acquisition of GPC. It is our management’s belief that the deal will  
have a positive impact on the value of the Group.
GPC is an urban-retailer, with para-pharmacies representing c.30% 
of revenues in 2016.
The role of data management and software solutions in people 
management is critical in the company of our size and operation.  
In order to manage Evex workforce efficiently, in 2016, we started  
a partnership with a new software developer who specialises in the 
Human Resources Management System (“HRMS”). Five modules 
have been purchased for use in our Human Resources (“HR”) 
core processes: 
1. HRMS data management; 
2. recruitment management;
3. training management;
4. self-service portal; and
5. payroll management.

These applications are tailored according to GHG HR policy and 
procedural needs. Implementation of the HRMS and payroll 
application process started in 2016 and is scheduled to be finished 
by the end of second quarter of 2017 . The software will significantly 
increase automation and optimisation of the workflow of many of 
our HR-related organisational procedures, including employee data 
administration, recruitment data processing and statistical and 
analytical reporting.
On the other hand, GPC develops its existing software according to 
newly emerged group HR needs and addresses them efficiently.
We recognise the fundamental importance of human rights and  
are committed to implementing socially responsible business 
practices. Our Corporate Handbook – Code of Conducts and Ethics 
establishes our main priorities and puts control procedures in place 
to provide equal opportunities and to prevent discrimination or 
harassment on any grounds. Our HR Policy applies to all 
employment processes, including training and development.
We are committed to employee engagement. We believe that 
communication and awareness is key, and to that end we strive  
to provide our employees with a continuous flow of information, 
which includes but is not limited to information about our corporate 
culture, the Group’s strategy and performance, risks relating to its 
performance, such as financial and economic factors, and our 
policies and procedures. We provide information in a number of 
ways: by inclusion in departmental managers’ presentations,  
our intranet, e-mail and regular town hall and off-site meetings.  
We value the views of our employees. We consult with our 
employees regularly and have implemented feedback systems, 
such as frequent employee satisfaction surveys to ensure that  
our employees’ opinions are taken into account when making 
decisions which are likely to affect their interests. Employee 
feedback also helps to improve our customer service approach.
The Group gives full and fair consideration to applications for 
employment received from disabled people. The Group ensures 
that disabled people are fairly treated in both their training and 
career development. Should an employee become disabled whilst 
working for the Group, we will endeavour to adapt the work 
environment and provide re-training if necessary so that they may 
continue their employment with us and maximise their potential.
T alent attraction
To ensure optimum human resources for our growing business  
and to maintain the high standards of our teams we are constantly 
looking for new ways of attracting the most talented experts. The 
Employee Planning and Recruitment Division is responsible for this 
process as well as for staff planning and recruitment by constantly 
updating the pool of candidates for our ongoing and forward-looking 
recruitment needs:
• vacancy announcements on job sites, social networks and  
other media sources; 
• job fairs and “milk rounds” in universities;
• internship programmes with universities;
• post-graduate education “Residency” programmes; 
• open and free training by Evex Learning Centre (founded  
by GHG);
• partnering with medical associations in Georgia and abroad;
• headhunting for key specialist and managerial positions;
• partnering with private and state HR employment agencies; and
• headhunting of Georgian specialists working abroad.

Memoranda of Understanding with universities
Medical educational institutions continue to be our main resource 
of emerging talent. Both, Evex and its own learning centre –  
(“Evex Learning Centre”) – established partnerships and signed 
Memoranda of Understandings (“MoUs”) with various nursing 
colleges and universities. We provided them with our clinical  
sites for various educational purposes, including basic on-the-job 
education, training programmes and affiliated residency 
programmes. For instance, during 2016, Evex Learning Centre 
conducted six months free nursing courses for 235 students from 
nursing colleges. As mentioned above, 61 graduates who overcame 
the examinational barrier were offered jobs at our healthcare 
services facilities.

T raining and development
We invest a lot of effort and funds in various professional 
educational opportunities – mostly for our nurses and physicians  
at Evex and pharmacists at GPC. In 2016, Evex spent about GEL 2 
million on training and development. The main expenses were for 
nursing training, ER specialists’ training and advancement of 
specialists in various medical fields.
We are proud to have our own Evex Learning Centre, the only 
centre in Georgia offering continuous medical education. Apart from 
modern training methods, the centre offers up-to-date equipment, 
auditoria, computer labs and other facilities that conform to the 
highest international standards. Our learning centre independently 
develops and runs a variety of Continuing Professional Development 
Programmes (“CDP”). Most of the CDPs consist of medical training 
for physicians and nurses, although some non-medical staff, such 
as hospital administrators and registry employees also participated. 
We are proud to report that in 2016, the Evex Learning Centre 
trained a total of 2,299 nurse-participants, 2,035 physician-
participants and 937 administration employees.

We assess the competencies and knowledge of candidates with 
tests and various types of interviews including behavioural tests 
and case analyses. In addition, we conduct medical tests for 
medical candidates, such as physicians and nurses, whilst for 
administrative positions we use GMAT professional tests or general 
abilities tests.
Job fairs
Job fairs are one of the most effective tools for attracting young 
talent. During 2016, our healthcare services business (“Evex”) 
participated in seven job fairs organised by our HR consultancy 
companies and leading universities in Tbilisi and other regions of 
Georgia. As for attracting medical students, in 2016 the HR 
department organised three meetings with students in leading 
medical universities in Tbilisi and five meetings in nursing colleges 
in Tbilisi and other regions. Evex attracted a total of 235 students 
from universities and colleges onto its nursing course as a result  
of these the job fairs. 61 of them finished the course and were 
recruited on to nursing positions. 59

Strategic report
Strategy
The training courses for our physicians are based upon national 
guidelines and protocols as well as the latest international findings. 
At present, there are no national standards or regulations for the 
training of nurses in Georgia. Georgia Healthcare Group is a pioneer 
in the training of nurses and we have created our own protocols, 
guidelines and training modules.
Our Pharma business (“GPC”) employee development process  
is led by trainers (employees with a specific background in 
Pharmacology, Parapharmacy and Operational Standards), mentors 
(employees from different business units supporting on job training 
and inductions) and coaches (employees with appropriate 
backgrounds who conduct soft skills training).
Residency
In line with our strategy to develop a new generation of doctors  
in Georgia, we launched a postgraduate educational residency 
programme in a number of fields. These programmes ensure 
development of qualified specialists in areas where we have lacked 
physicians. Thus far, we have received a high level of interest in 
such programmes. Since the launch of the programme in 
December 2015, we have received 557 applications from 
prospective residents.
Partnerships
Our healthcare services business highly appreciates its partnership 
with D. Tvildiani Medical University, with whom Evex initiated and 
facilitated the opening of a joint Nurse College. With a strong 
international background, Tvildiani Medical University is one of the 
most popular medical universities in Georgia. The partnership 
includes a joint effort to ensure that high quality educational 
standards are achieved; promotes the field of nursing in Georgia 
and attracts more younger school graduates to encompass the 
needs of our healthcare services. Evex contributes 20% of the 
college expenses. It further offers a grant system and student loans 
for excellent students and provides them with further opportunities 
to advance their studies. As an additional incentive, successful 
graduates will be offered jobs at our hospitals. 
Employee incentivisation
Evex has implemented a performance management system and 
pay-for-performance culture. At the beginning of each year, all 
business units plan collective and individual goals that are aligned 
with annual Key Business Objectives (“KBOs”). Our employees 
undergo annual or half-yearly performance assessments based on 
these KBOs and other competencies that reflect our values and  
the strategic objectives outlined by the Board of Directors.

Managerial and back office employees are assessed annually, both 
at the head office and in clinics as well. Front end employees (e.g. 
registry office) are assessed twice a year. Clinic directors are 
assessed on the quarterly bases and receive feedback and 
development plan from their supervisors. 
We created both financial and non-financial incentive schemes to 
increase productivity and job satisfaction amongst our employees. 
These incentives vary from role to role. We offer non-monetary 
benefits that include medical insurance, malpractice insurance, 
pension plans and allowances for accommodation, transport and 
coverage for mobile expenses.
Evex nurses who successfully graduated our internal nursing 
standards training are granted with additional pay for one year,  
until another annual attestation.
We pay attention to employee engagement and satisfaction. In 
2016 Evex established a new “Corporate culture development 
division” which aims to create our corporate culture and spirit by 
nonmonetary motivation, employee surveys, team building events.
Staff bonuses are paid on a monthly/quarterly basis as defined 
within the GPC realisation plans. Every employee who participates  
in any kind of sales process is included in a material motivational 
scheme, the specifics of which vary according to their position  
and responsibilities. Technical staff do not receive any type of 
bonus. In addition to those mentioned above, other types of 
incentives for employees include: gifts, one-time premiums, thank 
you letters and certificates. To motivate the employees of GPC we 
may authorise initiate the payment of annual, quarterly, monthly and 
one-time additional bonus and payment principles. Additionally, front line 
staff is annually awarded with “thank you” certificates in categories 
such as best service and best consultant. The best of the best 
employees may be sent for a weekend trip abroad. GPC employee’s 
assessment methods include a categorisation examination for  
front staff (pharmacists, consultants and pharmacy managers),  
a manager assessment with a special questionnaire and structured 
interview enabling the employer to evaluate the employee, overall 
performance and competencies as well as KPI fulfilment which 
include both quantitative and qualitative criteria. For front line staff 
this takes place annually, while Pharmacy Managers are appraised 
once every two years.
Policies
The Group has in place a Code of Conduct and Ethics, Anti-Bribery 
and Anti-Corruption Policy, Whistleblowing Policy and an 
Environmental and Social Policy. These relate to our environmental 
matters, employees, social matters, our respect for human rights 
and anti-corruption and bribery. 
Copies of these policies can be found on the Group’s website;  
http://ghg.com.ge/page/id/130/policies.
Community matters
The Group considers the interests of its main stakeholders,  
which include patients, customers, shareholders, employees  
and society, in the development of its strategy and operations 
improvement processes. We strive to positively contribute to 
society through the entire scope of our business activities by 
developing socially oriented services, implementing responsible 
approaches to our business operations and carrying out 
sponsorship and charitable activities. In doing the foregoing  
we follow our undertakings in respect of social and community 
matters set out in our Environmental and Social Policy.
The Group is proud to serve three-quarters of Georgia’s population 
and makes every effort to promote the healthy living and wellbeing 
of local communities. We use our medical expertise in our social 
initiatives to focus primarily on providing pro bono medical assistance, 
developing medical infrastructure and improving the health 
awareness of the Georgian population.
In 2016 the healthcare services business significantly increased  
its financing of existing sponsorship projects as well as 
commencing new ones. As a result, the Group’s total sponsorship 
and charitable spending increased more than two times to 
GEL 1 .1 million. 60

Children’s hospice
On 17 January 2017 , the first children’s hospice “Firefly World”  
was launched in Georgia. The children’s hospice is a family-
orientated facility, which will provide palliative care for children  
with chronic and incurable illnesses. The hospice will provide  
three basic services: 
• a 24-hour service for ten children at any one time and their 
parents;
• a daytime centre, where children and their parents can stay 
throughout the day to receive the necessary services; and
• a home care service, which has been in place for the past  
year and provides services to 26 children, which will continue 
to operate. 
Construction of the children’s hospice was launched in October 
2015 upon the initiative of the Open Society Georgia Foundation,  
with initial funding from Evex as well as with the support of the 
President’s fund. Since then, hundreds of donors, among them 
ordinary citizens and business companies, expressed readiness  
to support the hospice. Over GEL 1 million was raised during  
a year to build the hospice. The children’s hospice project is the 
outcome of one of the best examples of cooperation between 
business, the non-Governmental sector, the President, journalists 
and citizens alike. The Tbilisi Children’s Hospice aims to conform to 
the standards of the world’s best hospices. Besides having 
professional and attentive personnel, the environment, interior, 
name of the hospice and all those details, which largely determine 
children’s life in the hospice, are extremely important. The Tbilisi 
Children’s Hospice has only recently started receiving patients and 
the home care service has been working very successfully. We now 
have 26 patients and a new day-care centre.
Children’s oncology programme
The Group traditionally participates in the state Children’s oncology 
programme under which we offer oncology treatment for children  
in our Iashvili Paediatric Tertiary Referral Hospital, a multi-profile 
paediatric medical establishment. Our clinic is an unique provider  
of this service in Georgia, for which about GEL 2 million is 
subsidised annually. In 2016, 701 young patients received treatment 
under this programme.
Promotion of Health Awareness
Sponsoring medical TV programmes is our way of promoting good 
health awareness and practices, enabling us to reach a wide range 
of the Georgian population. We have five TV shows: The Doctors, 
Day Show, Impulse, Medical hour and Mechanical Ventilation 
(“Khelovnuri Suntkva” , a soap opera). All shows share their relevant 
health expertise in a simple and clear manner on various health and 
wellness issues such as screening programmes, allergies, cardio 
vascular disease, oncology, arthritis and others. Sometimes 
celebrity interviews are conducted, health news, healthy recipes 
and helpful tips are also broadcast during the shows. As our 
medical TV programmes proved to be very popular in 2015, we 
increased their scale and financing from GEL 177 ,180 in 2015 to 
GEL 730,841 in 2016.

Conferences for doctors
We believe that professional medical education is a cornerstone  
of healthcare quality in Georgia. For this reason, we make an effort 
to develop a healthy learning environment by financing international 
and local medical conferences. In 2016, we sponsored six medical 
conferences which brought together medical scholars and health 
care practitioners from Europe, Asia and Georgia to share 
knowledge and experience that influence and shape healthcare 
delivery. As a result, in the reporting period we almost doubled  
our support of conferences (from GEL 149,684 to GEL 276,178 
respectively).
Environmental matters
We recognise that our operations have an impact on the 
environment and we approach this matter responsibly. Most of  
the Group’s environmental impact comes from medical waste 
generation and combustion of fuels both for stationary use and  
for owned vehicles. We also have an affect on the environment  
by using significant amounts of water in our hospitals, purchasing 
electricity and paper. Although our overall negative impact is 
relatively low, we still aim to become more resource efficient  
and environmentally friendly.
In 2016 we developed our waste management policy with this aim 
in mind.
Waste management
The hospitals’ most significant environmental impact is associated 
with the generation of medical waste. Environmental risks can  
be significantly minimised with proper waste handling and safe 
disposal. In identifying and minimising this environmental impact 
and putting these procedures into practice we follow the 
undertakings in respect of environmental matters set out in  
our Environmental and Social Policy. Our waste management 
procedures are compliant with the relevant Georgian legislation 
which defines risk categories and appropriate procedures for 
medical waste treatment.
To prevent human and environmental harm, our clinics collect and 
dispose of medical and biological waste through an outsourced 
service specialising in medical waste disposal. For the collection  
of waste, we use plastic bags that have sufficient strength and are 
secured with staples to safely retain waste. Also, we do not fill 
more than two-thirds of the bags’ capacity. Further, steam 
sterilisation is used to decontaminate biological and bio hazardous 
waste, including blood. All used sharps are placed only in labelled, 
hermetic single-use dedicated containers made of hard plastic. 
Waste is collected from our sites daily, twice a day when required. 
The maximum on-site storage time of waste is up to 24 hours.
To ensure the reliability of our contractors we examine their

Greenhouse gas emissions management
To light our hospitals’ premises and run the necessary medical 
equipment we annually consume thousands of kilowatts of 
electricity. In fact, electricity usage accounts for approximately  
half of our total greenhouse gas generation. To reduce our negative 
impact, we implemented a number of energy saving solutions,  
such as installation of LED lights and energy efficient equipment. 
We also work out ways to minimise our carbon footprint by other 
means. For instance, heat insulation is being improved in a number 
of hospitals. Despite this there was still an increase of Scope 2 
emissions in 2016 mainly due to electricity consumption by Groups’ 
new subsidiary GPC that we acquired during 2016.
Further steps
In the coming years, we plan to implement a number of initiatives 
that will bring positive impact both on the environment and on our 
operating efficiency. 
Appendix 1. GHG Emissions Calculation Methodology
We have reported on all of the emission sources required under  
the Companies Act 2006 (Strategic Report and Directors’ Reports) 
Regulations 2013 (Scope 1 and 2) and additionally reported on  
some emissions under Scope 3. These sources fall within our 
consolidated financial statements. We do not have responsibility  
for any emission sources that are not included in our 
consolidated statement.
We have used the World Resources Institute/World Business 
Council for Sustainable Development (“WRI”/”WBCSD”) 
Greenhouse Gas Protocol (“GHG”): A Corporate Accounting  
and Reporting Standard (revised edition) and emission factors  
from UK Government’s GHG Conversion.
Factors for Company Reporting 2015.
The reported data is collected and reported on for three of our 
Group’s businesses:
• healthcare services, including its head office, hospitals  
and other entities where GHG has operational control;
• pharma, including its head office and pharmacies; and
• medical insurance, including its head office.
Scope 1 (combustion of fuel and facilities operation) includes 
emissions from:
• combustion of natural gas, diesel and petrol in stationary 
equipment at owned and controlled sites; and
• combustion of petrol and diesel in owned transportation devices 
(cars and buses).
Scope 2 (electricity, heat, steam and cooling purchased for own 
use) includes emissions from:
• electricity spent at owned and controlled sites; to calculate the 
emissions we used conversion factor for Non-OECD Europe and 
Eurasia (average) conversion from the UK Government’s GHG 
Conversion Factors for Company Reporting 2015; and
• used heat and steam.
Scope 3 includes emissions from:
• air business travel (short haul and long haul); information  
on class of travel is unavailable hence we used an “average 
passenger” conversion factor; and
• ground transportation, including taxi, coaches and car hire.
Data on emissions resulting from travel is reported for business-
related travel only, and excludes commuting travel. Data from joint 
ventures, investments or sub-leased properties have not been 
included within the reported figures.
The data is provided by onsite delegates, invoices and 
meter readings.

Risk  
management
We are exposed to a variety of risks and uncertainties which could have  
a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, operational 
results and reputation as well as on the value of our shares. We recognise 
that the effective management of risk and a robust system of internal 
controls is critical to delivering our strategic objectives and protecting  
the interests of our shareholders.
Overview
We identify, evaluate, manage and monitor the risks that we face 
through an integrated control framework consisting of formal 
policies and procedures, clearly delegated authority levels and 
comprehensive reporting. The Board confirms that our framework 
has been in place throughout the year ended 31 December 2016 
and to the date of approval of this Annual Report and Accounts  
and is integrated into both our business planning and viability 
assessment processes.
Our Board, supported by our Audit Committee and Clinical Quality 
and Safety Committee and senior management, is ultimately 
responsible for the Group’s risk management and internal controls 
and for ensuring that an appropriate culture has been embedded 
throughout the organisation.
We have worked to ensure that managing risk is ingrained in our 
everyday business activities. We seek to create an environment 
where there is openness and transparency in how we make 
decisions and manage risks and where business managers are 
accountable for the risk management and internal control 
processes associated with their activities. Our culture also seeks  
to ensure that risk management is responsive, forward-looking 
and consistent.
Our framework
The Board’s mandate includes determining the Group’s risk appetite 
and risk tolerance as well as monitoring risk exposures to ensure 
that the nature and extent of the main risks we face are consistent 
with our overall goals and strategic objectives. We develop risk 
management strategies which address the full spectrum of risks 
that the Group faces. We are accountable for reviewing the 
effectiveness of the systems and processes of risk management 
and internal control, with the Audit Committee and Clinical Quality 
and Safety Committee assisting in the discharge of this 
responsibility. We also focus on the resolution of any internal 
control failures that may arise. No significant failures occurred 
during 2016 and the period up to the date of this Annual Report.
The Group’s risk appetite is the amount and type of risk that we are 
prepared to seek, accept or tolerate. Our risk appetite evolves over 
time to reflect new risks and changes in external market 
developments and circumstances. 
Our control framework is the foundation for the delivery of effective 
risk management. We develop formal policies and procedures 
which explain the way in which risks need to be systematically 
identified, assessed, quantified, managed and monitored. We 
clearly delegate authority levels and reporting lines throughout the 
management hierarchy. Each business participates in the risk 
management process by identifying the key risks applicable to  
its business. Through senior management, we ensure that our 
employees are given the appropriate training and knowledge to 
perform their roles in line with the framework we have developed. 
A detailed description of the Group’s risk management and internal 
control framework can be found in this Risk Management section.
On a day-to-day basis, management is responsible for the 
implementation of the Group’s risk management and other internal 
control policies and procedures. Based on our risk culture, 
managers “own” the risks relevant to their respective function. 
 
For each risk identified at any level of the business, the risk is 
measured, mitigated (where possible) in accordance with our 
policies and procedures and monitored. Managers are required  
to report on identified risks and responses to such risks on a 
consistent basis. Senior management reviews the output from  
the bottom-up process by providing independent challenge and 
assessing the implementation of the risk management and internal 
control policies and procedures.
This system is bespoke to the Group’s particular needs and risks  
to which it is exposed and is designed to manage rather than 
eliminate risk. Due to the limitations inherent in any system of 
internal control, this system provides robust, but not absolute, 
assurance against material misstatement or loss.
The Board has put in place corporate governance policies and 
procedures that aim to ensure that there is good and clear 
awareness and understanding of the policies and procedures 
amongst senior management.
Comprehensive reporting forms an integral part of our framework. 
Our reporting process enables key risks to be escalated to the 
appropriate level of authority and provides assurance to the 
Committees and the Board. Key developments affecting our 
principal risks and associated mitigating actions are reviewed 
quarterly (or more often if necessary on an ad hoc basis if outside 
of the regular reporting process) by the Audit Committee and the 
Clinical Quality and Safety Committee, as appropriate, and the 
Board. The principal risks and uncertainties faced by the Group  
are identified through this process.
A description of these principal risks and uncertainties in 
addition to key drivers and trends as well as mitigation 
efforts can be found on pages 68 to 71 . 65

Audit Committee Clinical Quality and Safety Committee
The Board is also responsible for determining the nature and extent 
of any principal risks the Group is willing to take in order to achieve 
its strategic objectives.
Key elements of the Group’s system of internal control which have 
operated throughout to the year ended 31 December 2016 are:
• procedures for the assessment, approval, control and monitoring 
of major capital projects, including acquisitions and disposals 
such as the acquisition of GPC and ABC pharmaceutical 
businesses;
• a robust Board committee structure, where each committee 
deals with specific aspects of the Group’s affairs and an 
organisational structure with clearly defined levels of authority 
and division of responsibilities;
• regular reports to the Audit Committee and Clinical Quality and 
Safety Committee on the adequacy and effectiveness of internal 
control by, among others the Head of Internal Audit, the Head of 
Clinical Process Audit Unit, the Head of Clinical, the Director of 
the Legal Department and the Chief Financial Officer;
• the close involvement of the Executive Director in all aspects  
of day-to-day operations, including regular meetings with senior 
management to review all operational aspects of the business 
and risk management systems;
• a structure of operational committees that have established 
various policies and which monitor the risk in the given operation;
• a Remuneration Policy for executives, which motivates them 
appropriately without encouraging excessive risk taking (the 
Remuneration Policy can be found on pages 107 to 113), which 
for the period applied to the Executive Director only); 
• reviewing and monitoring the operation of the Whistleblowing 
Policy and procedures in place to allow staff to raise concerns  
on a confidential or anonymous basis about possible legal, 
regulatory, financial reporting or other improprieties;
• the Audit Committee’s review of the quarterly, half year and full 
year financial statements and corresponding press releases;
• the attendance at the Audit Committee meetings of the internal 
and external auditors; and
• updates, on a monthly basis, to the Management Board in 
relation to the Group’s financial risk profile, policies, limits and 
ratios by the Chief Financial Officer.
Internal control
Board and Board Committees
As mentioned above, our Board is responsible for reviewing and 
approving the Group’s system of internal control and its adequacy 
and effectiveness. Controls are reviewed to ensure effective 
management of strategic, financial, operational and compliance risk 
issues. Certain matters, such as the approval of the long-term 
objectives and strategy, the annual operating and capital 
expenditure budgets and significant acquisitions or disposals, 
among others, are reserved exclusively for the Board. The full 
schedule of matters specifically reserved for the Board can be 
found on our website, at http://ghg.com.ge/page/id/135/schedule-of-
matters-reserved.
With respect to other matters, as above, the Board is often assisted 
by the Audit Committee and Clinical Quality and Safety Committee.
The Audit Committee has overall responsibility for implementing 
principles, frameworks, policies and limits in accordance with the 
Group’s risk management strategy related to the Group’s internal 
financial controls and internal control and risk management system, 
control weaknesses, fraud or misconduct, IT , cyber security, 
compliance, corporate security and similar areas of operational risk. 
The Audit Committee facilitates the activities of the internal audit 
and external auditors of the Group. The Audit Committee is elected 
and directly monitored by the independent members of the Board.
The Clinical Quality and Safety Committee reviews the Group’s 
clinical performance and supervises clinical and medical quality and 
health and safety, as well as ensuring that the clinical risks are 
monitored, supervised and managed properly. The respective 
quality and safety risk management system is implemented by the 
Clinical Department. The Clinical Department prepares reports and 
analyses for the Clinical Quality and Safety Committee and engages 
in discussion of the findings and risk areas for further mitigation and 
improvement. Interaction is at least quarterly, however, may be 
more frequent, upon identification of reportable conditions and 
risks. The Clinical Quality and Safety Committee defines and 
approve key policies and targets for the Clinical Department during 
the year.

Financial Reporting and Internal Audit Department
With respect to internal control over financial reporting, including 
over the Group’s consolidation process, our financial procedures 
include a range of system, transactional and management oversight 
controls. The Finance department prepares detailed monthly 
management reports that include analyses of our business results 
along with comparisons to relevant strategic plans, budgets, 
forecasts and prior results.
These are presented to and reviewed by senior management.  
Each quarter, the Chief Financial Officer as well as the finance team 
discuss financial reporting and associated internal controls with the 
Audit Committee, which reports significant findings to the Board. 
The Audit Committee also reviews the quarterly, half-year and 
full-year financial statements and corresponding press releases and 
provides feedback to the Board. The external and internal auditors 
attend most Audit Committee meetings and the Audit Committee 
meets regularly both with and without management present.
The Internal Audit Department reviews financial areas of risk 
pursuant to a programme approved by the Audit Committee.  
Any issues or risks arising from an internal audit review are 
reviewed by the Audit Committee and appropriate actions are 
undertaken to ensure satisfactory resolution. The Head of Internal 
Audit has a direct reporting line to the Chairman of the 
Audit Committee.
Clinical Risk Reporting and Clinical Process Audit Unit
The Clinical Process Audit Unit reviews areas of non-financial risk 
pursuant to a programme approved by the Clinical Quality and 
Safety Committee. The Head of Clinical Process Audit Unit has  
a direct reporting line to the Chairman of the Clinical Quality and 
Safety Committee. Just as the Internal Audit reports to the Audit 
Committee, any issues or risks arising from the Clinical Process 
Audit Unit’s internal audit review are reported to the Clinical Quality 
and Safety Committee and appropriate actions are undertaken to 
ensure a satisfactory resolution.
The Clinical Department is in charge of the entire healthcare risk 
assessment and management. The healthcare risk assessment  
and reporting system requires the quality management group  
(head office and hospitals) to prepare specifically designed reports 
on a monthly basis, to identify the potential risks and gaps for 
improvement and to prepare tailored recommendations for those 
improvements. Risks are identified from a number of internal and 
external sources. Internal sources are: incident reports (sentinel 
event, near misses, medication dispensing errors, adverse drug 
reactions, injury reports), peer review activities, complaints and 
claims, patient and staff satisfaction surveillance reports, quality 
and safety measures and indicators, clinical audit and medical 
records. External sources include: patient surveys or feedback, 
review reports and correction reports issued by the healthcare 
regulator. Through assessing the proper data and information, the 
Clinical Department identifies whether or not each of the medical 
facility and the Group are in compliance with preliminary defined 
quality and safety goals. The Clinical Department also identifies 
what is the financial loss attributable to medical malpractice and 
penalties. Clinical risk assessment and analysis process is based  
on the detailed study of the failure events, analysis of the risks 
associated with these failure events and their root causes as well.
Management Board
The Management Board has responsibility for the Group’s balance 
sheet, income statement and risk management activities, policies 
and procedures. In order to effectively implement the risk 
management system, the Management Board receives reports  
on risk management functions from each of the various 
departments within the Group.
Whistleblowing 
Our systems of internal control are also supported by our 
Whistleblowing Policy, which allows employees to report concerns 
on an anonymous basis using a 24-hour hotline or a sealed 
message box in Head Office. The Audit Committee approves the 
Whistleblowing Policy on an annual basis and receives reports from 
the Director of the Legal Department on any significant 
issues raised.
Effectiveness review
Each year, we review the effectiveness of our risk management 
processes and internal control systems, with the assistance of the 
Audit Committee and Clinical Quality and Safety Committee. This 
review covers all material systems, including financial, operational 
and compliance controls. The latest review covered the financial 
year ended 31 December 2016 and the period to the approval of 
this Annual Report and Accounts.
This year we obtained assurance from management, Internal Audit, 
our external auditors and other external specialists. 
The Board is able to conclude with reasonable assurance that the 
appropriate internal control and risk management systems were 
maintained throughout the year and operated effectively. The  
review did not identify any significant weaknesses or failings in  
the systems. 
We are satisfied that our risk management processes and internal 
control systems processes comply with the UK Corporate 
Governance Code 2014 (the Code) and the FRC’s (Financial 
Reporting Council) guidance on Risk Management, Internal Control 
and Related Financial and Business Reporting.
In 2017 we will continue striving to improve our risk management. 
In particular the Group is putting into place a centralised Risk 
Department to better coordinate the management of risk within  
the Group. On 27 March 2017 the new Chief Risk Officer was 
appointed to this new role to develop and lead this 
new department.
Committee reports
As noted throughout this discussion, both the Audit Committee and 
Clinical Quality and Safety Committee play an essential role in 
implementing effective risk management and internal control. Each 
Committee has described this work in their Committee report.
The Audit Committee Report and Clinical Quality and 
Safety Committee Report can be found on pages 92 to 96

Viability statement
Assessment of prospects
An understanding of the Group’s business model and strategy are 
central to assessing its prospects, and details can be found on 
pages 2 to 80. We assess our prospects on a regular basis through 
strategic planning, financial planning, budgeting and forecasting of 
business performance. This assessment considers the Group’s 
revenue, cash flows, committed and forecast funding and liquidity 
positions and other key financial ratios. Over the last three years  
the Group has grown significantly through implementation of the 
strategies set by management and supported by stable long-term 
funding provided by both shareholders and the creditors. The 
Group’s revenue, EBITDA and net profit grew by 73.4%, 39.0%  
and 159.7% per annum, over last three years. All of the Group’s 
strategies across all business lines are threaded by a long-term 
sustainable growth through a well-managed and sustained 
long-term leverage levels. None of the Group’s investments are 
short-term and all of them are oriented on long-term value creation 
for its shareholders. 
Viability statement
In accordance with provision C.2.2 of the Code, the Directors are 
required to assess the prospects of the Company to meet its 
liabilities by taking into account its current position and principal 
risks. The Board conducted this review over a three-year period 
beginning 1 January 2017 , being the first day after the end of the 
financial year to which this report relates. The Board selected this 
period for the following reasons: a) it considers its strategic plan, 
financial budgets and forecasts for a three-year period, annually; 
and b) it is impracticable to establish a longer-period planning within 
existing operating and macroeconomic environment. 
In order to consider the Group’s viability, the Board considered  
a number of key factors, including:
• the Group’s financial and operational position, including 
key metrics;
• Group’s cash flows and capital allocation;
• the Board’s risk appetite;
• the Group’s business model and strategy as set out on pages  
2 to 80;
• the Group’s principal risks and uncertainties, as set out on pages 
68 to 71; 
• how the principal risks and uncertainties are managed;
• the effectiveness of our risk management framework and 
internal control processes; and
• stress-testing, as described below.
The key factors above have been reviewed in the context of our 
current position and strategic plan, financial budgets and forecasts 
assessed annually and on a three-year basis.
The viability assessment involved a risk identification process which 
involved recognition of the principal risks to viability (that could 
impair the Group’s business model, future performance, solvency  
or liquidity), excluding risks not sufficiently severe over the period of 
assessment. We also identified other risks, while not necessarily 
severe in themselves, but could escalate when combined with 
others, as well as risk combinations. For each risk, we considered 
our risk appetite and tolerance as well as risk the proximity (how 
soon the risk could occur) and momentum (the speed with which 
the impact of the risk will be felt).
For those risks considered sufficiently severe to affect our viability, 
we performed stress testing for the assessment period, which 
involved modelling the impact of a combination of severe and 
plausible adverse scenarios, including the following, in each case 
with the fact scenario to that effect immediately: a) reduction of 
UHC tariffs by 5%; b) extension of an average State receivables 
collection cycle from current four months to six months; c) increase 
of supplier prices by 5%, as a result of the exchange rate pressures 
on imported goods; d) a sudden deterioration of the receivables 
credit risk by 200 bps; e) depreciation of Lari by 20%; f) instant 
growth of total insurance claims by 15%; and g) in the last scenario, 
all of the previous stress scenarios happening all together. The 
stress test scenarios were then reviewed against the Group’s 
current and projected liquidity position, considering current 
committed funding. The stress testing also took into account the 
availability and likely effectiveness of the mitigating actions that 
could be taken to avoid or reduce the impact or occurrence of the 
identified underlying risks to which the Group is exposed. No 
mitigating actions were required except for scenarios b) and g). 
The Directors have also satisfied themselves that they have the 
evidence necessary to support the statement below in terms of the 
effectiveness of the Group’s risk management framework and 
internal control processes in place to mitigate risk.
Based on the analysis described above, the Directors confirm that 
they have a reasonable expectation that the Company will be able 
to continue in operation and meet its liabilities as they fall due over 
the three-year period from 1 January 2017 to 31 December 2019. 68

Principal risks  
and uncertainties
The Board has performed a robust assessment of the principal risks facing 
the Group taking into account the Group’s strategic objectives, business 
model, operations, future performance, solvency and liquidity . 
All principal risks identified by the Board may have an impact on our 
business strategic objectives. These principal risks are described in 
the table that follows, together with the relevant strategic business 
objectives, key risk drivers/trends, material controls which have 
been put in place to mitigate the principal risks and the mitigation 
actions we have taken. It is recognised that the Group is exposed 
to risks wider than those listed. We disclose those we believe are 
likely to have the greatest impact on our business at this moment  
in time and which have been the subject of debate at recent Board, 
Audit or Clinical Quality and Safety Committee meetings. 
The order in which the Principal Risks and Uncertainties appear 
does not denote their order of priority. It is not possible to fully 
mitigate all of our risks. Any system of risk management and 
internal control is designed to manage rather than eliminate the  
risk of failure to achieve business objectives and can only provide 
reasonable and not absolute assurance against material 
misstatement or loss. 
The Group has grown in size, and added 
sectors, through acquisitions including 
of its pharmaceutical businesses.
The Group may face challenges in 
integrating its new businesses into its 
existing Group. Challenges could include 
but are not limited to the full integration of 
IT systems, a lack of human resources and 
failure to achieve expected synergies.
Impact
Failure to integrate successfully would 
adversely affect anticipated synergies, our 
strategy, projected growth and revenues.
In May 2016 and January 2017 the Group 
completed the acquisition of JSC GPC  
and JSC ABC Pharmacia (brand name 
Pharmadepot) respectively, adding the new 
business lines of pharmaceutical retail and 
wholesale chains.
• The integration team meets at least 
weekly to discuss all aspects of the 
pharmacy integration process, including 
but not limited to strategy, financial, 
commercial, clinical, IT , human 
resources and legal matters.
• The wider team involved in integration 
are highly skilled and experienced, 
having carried out over 30 integrations 
and acquisitions in the last six years.
• Key personnel and management from 
GPC and ABC Pharmacia have joined the 
Company to ensure business continuity 
including GPC’s CEO, and ABC 
Pharmacia’s CEO and COO.

Strategy
The Group operates across the 
healthcare ecosystem and is subject  
to a complex spectrum of laws, 
regulations and codes. 
In addition the Group operates in an 
emerging and developing market in which 
legislation is evolving and there may be 
further changes which affect the Group’s 
business.
Impact
Non-compliance with applicable laws, 
regulations, codes, authority or regulatory 
requirements, including those specific to 
tax, insurance or healthcare, or the settling 
of disputes or law suits, could lead to 
financial detriment, penalties, increased 
costs of operations, censure, regulatory 
investigation and reputational impact.
Inadequate record keeping or 
documentation of medical matters and 
patient data could lead to medical or 
administrative errors and regulatory 
breaches which could impact our financial 
performance.
• Changes to the UHC are being 
introduced in 2017 in respect of certain 
categories of employed persons and the 
full detail is not yet known.
• In October 2014, an anti-monopoly 
agency was established and anti-
monopoly legislation was implemented 
in respect of certain operations. We 
expect that such legislation may have an 
impact on our acquisitions as we will be 
required to seek prior approval from the 
Competition Authority to proceed with 
certain future acquisitions.
• The Group is involved in contractual and 
other disputes and litigation.
• Our healthcare service business 
includes a network of different hospitals 
and a nationwide chain of ambulatory 
clinics, each of which must comply with 
extensive documentation requirements 
and documentation maintenance 
requirements.
• Regulatory Authorites (Social Services 
Agency and state supervision agency of 
medical activities) conduct periodic 
inspections of Group clinics in order to 
determine the compliance with relevant 
regulatory requirements.
• Engaging in constructive dialogue with 
regulatory and Governmental bodies, 
where possible, and seek external advice 
on potential changes to legislation. 
• The Group has policies, procedures and 
controls to fulfil our compliance 
obligations, for example, Infection 
Control Management, Quality 
Management, Sentinel Event. 
Management and Waste Management.
• The Group’s Legal Department is involved 
in every material contract and advises on 
contractual disputes and litigations.
• The Tax Unit of the Finance Department 
follows changes in tax legislation and 
initiatives, checks compliance with rules 
and is involved in significant contracts.
• The Company has extensive process 
management systems in place to ensure 
that all documentation is carried out to  
a consistent standard and in compliance 
with Georgian regulatory requirements.
• Regular Audits are carried out internally  
by a team of experienced practitioners  
and a quality control unit. Their programme 
and audit results in respect of medical 
documentation are reviewed by the Clinical 
Quality and Safety Committee every 
quarter. Outcomes and changes to process 
are circulated throughout the Group.
Compliance
We are exposed to medical risk given the 
nature of our operations. 
The success of our healthcare services 
depends on our ability to recruit, train  
and retain an appropriate number of 
experienced physicians, nurses, technicians 
and other healthcare professionals and  
to deliver internationally recognised 
clinical care. 
We may not be able to provide the latest 
treatments and equipment or the range  
of services required. 
Our patients may contract serious 
infections or communicable diseases at our 
facilities because of the risks typically 
closely associated with the operation of 
medical care facilities.
Impact
Failure to comply with internationally 
recognised clinical care and quality 
standards or contracting serious infections 
or communicable diseases at our facilities 
or inability to recruit, train and retain 
appropriate practitioners could result in 
claims for damages, operational limitations 
a result of regulatory restrictions, affect 
patient loyalty or ability to attract patients,  
or loss of reputation.
• There is a shortage of suitably skilled 
and accredited medical practitioners 
in Georgia. 
• The hospital and outpatient network has 
grown rapidly during 2016 and requires 
the appropriate practitioners with the 
skills and experience to service it across 
a range of specialties.
• Our operations involve the treatment  
of patients with a variety of infectious 
diseases. Previously healthy or 
uninfected people may contract, during 
their stay at or visits to our facilities, 
serious communicable diseases.
• Talent attraction, including the key 
specialists recruitment programme is 
further explained in the Resources and 
Responsibilities section, on pages 57 
and 58.
• We provide an extensive training and 
skills development programme, see the 
Resources and Responsibilities section, 
Training and Development on pages 58 
to 59.  
This work will continue in 2017 .
• Our strategic objectives include 
investing in gaps we have identified in 
the medical services market.
• Investing significantly in medical 
equipment and our network of 
healthcare services allow us to 
maximise the use of this equipment.
• The Chief Medical Officer now has a 
comprehensive quality and safety 
structure in place with experienced 
practitioners in key roles.
• The Clinical Quality and Safety 
Committee meets at least quarterly to 
review the Group’s clinical services and 
performance, controls and compliance.
• Board members have visited a number 
of sites throughout 2016 to review 
practices and to discuss quality and 
safety with key practitioners.
• The Group has commenced a 
programme of initiatives on infection 
control, antibiotic stewardship, 
tuberculosis prevention and safety.

Concentration of Revenue
Our healthcare services business 
depends on revenue from the Georgian 
Government and a small number of 
private insurance providers for the 
hospital and clinic business lines, and 
therefore we face risks related to the 
Universal Healthcare Programme 
(“UHC”).
The private insurance companies we work 
with may experience financial difficulties 
and fail, or fail to pay the claims we submit 
to them for healthcare services provided to 
patients covered by their services.
Impact
Reduction of prices or increased time  
taken to pay, including delayed payment 
under the UHC, would affect the revenues, 
receivables outstanding and profitability  
of the Group.
Our ability to obtain favourable prices will 
depend in part on our ability to maintain 
good working relationships with private 
insurance providers and would be impacted 
by any changes to state funded healthcare 
programmes.
• The UHC remains a significant priority 
for the Government and Government 
expenditure on healthcare increased in 
2016 by 21% from GEL 826 million to 
GEL 996 million according to the 
approved Government budget for 2016.
• The Group monitors the macroeconomic 
environment in Georgia and budgetary 
performance of the state to assess the 
forecasted future cash flows from 
the State.
• The Group has diversified its portfolio by 
the addition of pharmaceutical retail and 
wholesale business lines.
The Group has foreign currency 
exposure, as a significant proportion  
of the medical equipment and 
pharmaceuticals we purchase are in 
Dollars and/or Euro but our revenues  
are in Lari.
A portion of our borrowings, particularly 
from Development Financial Institutions, 
is foreign currency-denominated. 
Impact
Depreciation of the Lari against Dollars and/
or Euros would adversely impact on our 
financial position and cash flows. 
The Lari has depreciated in value in 2016 by 
10.5% against the Dollar and 6.8% against 
the Euro.
• The Finance department monitors and 
the Management Board reviews our 
currency positions and adjusts strategies 
accordingly.
• We adjust our prices to reflect the 
fluctuation in foreign currency exchange 
rates to reduce their impact. The Group 
takes into account depreciation of the 
Lari in pricing discussions with 
counterparties.
• The Group has also prepaid a number of 
Dollar denominated loans and replaced 
them with Lari denominated loans and 
its remaining open position is small.

Strategy
We face information technology and 
operational risk.
A cyber attack, security breach or 
unauthorised access to our systems could 
cause important or confidential data to be 
misappropriated, misused, disseminated 
or lost. 
In addition improper access or information 
misappropriation may lead to insider trading 
or other illegal actions by employees 
or others.
In the event of the Group experiences 
information technology failure, important 
and confidential information may be lost. 
Software or network disruption may cause 
the Group to experience lost revenue, failed 
customer transactions or non-timely 
submission of extract or mandatory reports.
Non-recurring operational risks include 
incurring loss or unexpected expenses from 
system failure, human error, fraud or other 
unexpected events.
Impact
Any of the above could lead to disruption  
to our business and operations, affect 
patient and customer loyalty, subject us  
to state and Governmental investigation, 
litigation, damages, penalties and/or 
reputational damage.
We face macroeconomic and 
political risk.
There could be developments which have 
an adverse effect on the country, regional 
or macro economy such as reduced GDP  
or significant inflation. 
Georgia shares borders with Russia, 
Azerbaijan, Armenia and Turkey and has had 
ongoing disputes in the breakaway regions 
of Abkhazia and the Tskhinvali Region/South 
Ossetia and with Russia and regional 
tensions could materialise or increase.
Impact
Negative macroeconomic developments or 
escalation of conflicts may have an adverse 
effect on our business including putting 
adverse pressure on our business model, 
our revenues and our financial position.
We hold confidential data about our 
patients and customers given the nature  
of our healthcare services and must be 
vigilant to guard data privacy. 
Cyber-security threats are increasing year 
after year. 
The Group has expanded and has an 
increasingly complex operations to manage. 
The recently acquired pharmaceutical 
business has a separate IT department 
which covers the information, cyber 
security and hardware separately.
Tensions have recently increased between 
Russia and Turkey. Conflict remains 
unabated between Azerbaijan and Armenia.
• The Group’s Information Security Team 
within the IT Department tackles IT and 
security threats for its healthcare and 
insurance businesses. The IT 
Infrastructure team handles hardware 
projects and matters for the healthcare 
and insurance businesses. 
• We are planning to consolidate the 
Group’s efforts for information 
technology risk and bring the integrated 
process closer together with common 
standards and procedures.
• Internal Audit conducts regular reviews 
of IT controls such as the policies for 
information storage, availability and 
access, while updating its assessment 
of risks and recommendations. Internal 
Audit reports to the Audit Committee on 
its findings.
• The Group has recently integrated a new 
core operating system Vabaco into its 
healthcare business, such system 
having already been integrated with the 
Group’s core ERP , Exact, thus 
decreasing risks arising from human 
error and protecting the integrated data 
better. Vabaco is fully integrated with all 
external payment channels. As a result 
of this, nearly all of the healthcare 
services business runs on one unified 
platform with substantially increased 
functionality, capacity and speed.
• The Group continues to design and 
implement new business processes and 
risk management structures to better 
manage the business and to help 
mitigate our operational risks.
• The Group actively monitors market 
conditions, reviews market changes and 
performs stress and scenario tests in 
order to assess our financial position.
• Regular meetings of the Supervisory 
Board Audit Committee and the 
Management Board further analyse 
instability risks and forms responsive 
strategies and action plans.

Business review
Overview of 
financial results
Revenue
We delivered record full-year 2016 revenue of GEL 426.4 million 
(up 73.4% y-o-y). This growth was driven by all business lines. The 
first-time consolidation of revenues from our pharma business 
(“GPC”) acquired in May 2016 had the largest effect. The healthcare 
services business was the next biggest contributor to the revenue 
growth, with strong organic growth (16.3% in FY16) mainly as a 
result of: investments in new services to close the service gaps 
primarily in hospitals further strengthening our leading market 
position; and the roll out of the ambulatory clinics to tap a highly 
fragmented outpatient services segment (no single competitor has 
more than 1% market share by revenues). Growth of net insurance 
premiums earned contributed slightly to the Group revenue growth, 
while the increase in referrals from the medical insurance business 
to Group healthcare facilities resulted in an increase in the retention 
of medical insurance claims within the Group by 7 .2% y-o-y, in 2016.
In the full-year 2016, we achieved a well-diversified revenue mix  
at GHG, tapping all three segments of the Georgian healthcare 
ecosystem. 55% of our revenues came from the healthcare 
services business, 31% came from the pharma business 
(consolidated only since May 2016) and the remaining 14% came 
from the medical insurance business. 
Gross profit
In 2016, we continued our focus on extracting operating efficiencies 
and synergies in our healthcare and pharma businesses, achieving 
stronger gross profit margins as a result. Our medical insurance 
business continues to implement the initiatives to achieve targeted 
levels of loss ratio. The stronger gross profit in the healthcare 
services business is primarily a result of increase in both the scale 
of our business and the utilisation of our healthcare facilities, each 
of which drives more revenue, while fixed costs grow at a slower 
pace. We expect this trend to be supported next year by some of 
our healthcare facilities that we launched in 2016 and which are still 
in the ramp-up phase. On the other hand, some pressure on 
margins may result from the launch in 2017 of the two large 
hospitals in Tbilisi which we are currently renovating. Another factor 
favourably affecting gross profit in healthcare services is that we 
have started to realise the synergies in our medical disposables 
procurement as a result of entering into the pharma business. This 
process will be ongoing and the results of the cost savings are 
expected to be reflected in the coming year as well. As to gross 
profit in the pharma business itself, since the acquisition of GPC the 
pharma business, we have focused on implementing initiatives, 
such as renegotiating pricing with manufacturers and engaging in

more profitable sales initiatives and at the same time cancelling the 
initiatives which were not bringing additional business or which 
diluted margins. The acquisition of the Pharmadepot chain will  
allow us to continue these efforts in 2017 .
EBITDA
We reported record EBITDA of GEL 78.0 million (up 39.0% 
y-o-y) for FY16. EBITDA margin for the healthcare services was 
30.2%, compared to 27 .4% in 2015 (4Q16 was 31 .9%, compared  
to 29.8% in 4Q15). Healthcare services was the main contributor  
to this increase, with strong gross margin that resulted in strong 
positive operating leverage in the healthcare business at 17 .5 
percentage points. The addition of the pharma business from May 
2016 brought GEL 5.7 million EBITDA to the Group in 2016. For a 
more detailed discussion of the main factors affecting EBITDA,  
see the discussion of the segments. 
Profit
The Group’s profit was GEL 61.3 million. The healthcare services 
business was the main driver of the FY16 Group’s profit, and 
contributed GEL 64.5 million, up 195.1% y-o-y, followed by the 
pharma business, which contributed GEL 1 .9 million to the Group’s 
profit. The Group’s profit was partially offset by the loss of GEL 4.9 
million reported by the medical insurance businesses. Due to the 
changes in the corporate tax legislation in Georgia, the Group 
recognised one-off gains during the year (see the explanation in  
the second bullet point in “Operating performance highlights and 
notable developments in 2016, GHG”). Group profit, adjusted for 
the impact of deferred tax and adjusted for the foreign currency 
translation loss was GEL 39.6 million (up 117 .8% y-o-y).
Depreciation and amortisation
The Group continued sizeable development projects throughout the 
year and actively invested in healthcare facilities, which is reflected 
in the y-o-y growth of the depreciation and amortisation expenses 
(up 54.6% y-o-y). 
Financing costs
The Group reduced its borrowings in line with our strategy of 
deleveraging following the IPO. Additionally, the Group repaid a 
large part of the borrowings from local commercial banks and 
instead sourced longer-term and less expensive funding from 
Development Financial Institutions (“DFIs”). These efforts resulted 
in net interest expense decrease by 32.3% y-o-y. 
Foreign currency exposure cost
The foreign currency exposure is a result of a Dollar short position, 
arising from foreign currency-denominated borrowings from DFIs and 
the trade accounts payable of the pharma business. The Group started 
hedging its major open currency positions through typical foreign 
currency forwards (swap) bought from local commercial banks. 
During 3Q16 and 4Q16, the Group hedged US$27 .0 million and 
US$4.0 million of its short position. This helped to significantly reduce 
the open currency position, however, during fourth quarter 2016, the 
Group still had a short currency position of US$9.0 million due to the 
foreign currency denominated borrowings, which resulted in 
increased foreign currency losses as the Georgian Lari continued to 
devalue. By the end of December 2016, the Group’s entire foreign 
currency position other than to foreign suppliers of the pharma 
business has been closed fully. The cost of the foreign currency 
hedging is included in net interest expense in the income statement.
Balance sheet
Our balance sheet increased substantially over the last 12 months, as 
a result of the recent acquisitions (mostly GPC), reaching GEL 912.6 
million as at 31 December 2016. The growth of total assets by 20.3% 
y-o-y was largely driven by the 29.3% (GEL 130.3 million) increase in 
property and equipment reflecting investments in the renovation of 
hospitals, roll out of ambulatory clinics and the acquisition of the 
pharma business in 2016. 
The high level of cash and bank deposits at the end of 2015 reflected 
the receipt of IPO proceeds, and during 2016, a large part of those 
proceeds were deployed for the capex projects as well as for the 
acquisition of GPC. The increase in accounts receivable is primarily 
due to the growth in net revenues of healthcare services by 26.2% 
y-o-y. The pharma business consolidation primarily affected inventories 
and goodwill. Out of the GEL 54.9 million inventory balance at the 
year-end, GEL 40.0 million was attributable to the pharma business. 
Borrowed funds have increased y-o-y as a result of obtaining new 
cheaper funding from DFIs, replacing part the local funding previously 
repaid through IPO proceeds. We have simultaneously introduced the 
practice of hedging the foreign currency risk associated with these 
borrowings from DFIs that are denominated in foreign currency. We 
describe the swap agreements with local commercial banks in 
“Foreign currency exposure cost” above. A currency swap asset  
of GEL 6.3 million as at 31 December 2016 is recognised on the 
balance sheet, included in other assets. It is accounted at fair value 
and its carrying amount decreased our net debt as far as the 
instrument is attached to these borrowings.

Performance
Cash flow
The revenue cash conversion ratio, on a consolidated basis 
improved, reaching 91.2% in FY16 compared to 89.6% in FY15. 
This translated into an EBITDA cash conversion ratio of 68%  
on a consolidated adjusted basis for the same period. Significant 
growth across all lines of the operating cash flow reflects the 
organic growth of the business (16.3% y-o-y organic growth of  
the healthcare services business for FY16) as well as material 
acquisitions completed since 30 June 2015. To provide a like-for-like 
comparison for FY16 cash flows, we have applied a few 
adjustments for non-recurring cash flow items: a) in 2016 we 
accelerated payments to our core suppliers for the healthcare 
services and pharma businesses, in order to obtain higher 
discounts on procured materials and supplies – the full-year effect 
of this acceleration is GEL 0.6 million and GEL 4.6 million for the 
healthcare and pharma businesses, respectively; b) we also 
accelerated payments of aged general and administrative expenses 
by GEL 2.5 million; and c) we provided temporary funding to HTMC 
for the one-off tax settlement of GEL 1 million, as a result of the tax 
audit conducted prior to its acquisition (the settled amount had 
been fully provisioned at the time of acquisition). 
Net cash flows used in investing activities mostly comprise two 
acquisitions (HTMC, the cash payment of which was made in 2016 
although it was acquired in 2015 and the pharma business) as well 
as capex (additions to property and equipment), which grew by 
60.0% y-o-y, in line with the Group’s original three-year business 
plan. We invest in medical technology, on the back of renovated 
infrastructure, enhancing our service mix and introducing new 
services to cater for unfulfilled demand, as indicated by low 
incidence levels that lag far behind peer benchmarks. We define 
development capex as additions to GHG’s property, plant and 
equipment, excluding acquisitions. During 2016, we spent a total  
of GEL 111 .0 million on capital expenditure. Of this, maintenance 
capex was GEL 9.4 million. 
Net cash flows used in financing activities mostly reflect 
repayments of high interest rate borrowings by the end of 2015  
and beginning of 2016 as well as cash proceeds from the cheaper 
borrowings attracted during 2016, which are also reflected in 
reduced interest charges. 
Operating performance highlights and notable developments 
in 2016, GHG:
• In 2016, GHG entered in to the pharma market as a result of 
acquiring the third largest player in the pharma retail and 
wholesale market. In January 2017 , GHG also completed the 
acquisition of second pharma company – ABC – and became  
the largest pharma player in Georgia, with 29% market share,  
of the GEL 1 .3 billion market. The details of these acquisitions  
are described on pages 24 to 27 in this Annual Report. 
• In March 2016, we bought out the remaining 33.3% minority 
shareholding of our largest paediatric hospital, Iashvili Paediatric 
Tertiary Referral Hospital. We had held a 66.7% controlling 
interest in Iashvili since February 2014. In exchange for the 
33.3% minority shareholding at Iashvili, we paid cash of US$1 .0 
million and transferred all of our assets in Tbilisi Maternity 
Hospital “New Life” (“New Life”) to the seller of the minority 
stake. We had held a 100% stake in New Life since February 
2014. Operating 266 beds, Iashvili recorded GEL 25.2 million in 
gross revenue in 2015, of which GEL 8.4 million was attributable 
to the minority shareholder bought out as a result of this 
transaction. Operating 82 beds, New Life recorded GEL 2.4 
million in gross revenue in 2015.
• In May 2016, the Parliament of Georgia approved amendments 
to the corporate taxation model, with changes applicable from 
1 January 2017 for all entities apart from financial institutions, 
including insurance businesses (the changes are applicable to 
financial institutions, including insurance businesses, from 
1 January 2019). The changed model implies zero corporate tax 
rate on retained earnings and 15% tax rate on distributed 
earnings, compared to the previous model of 15% tax rate 
charged to the company’s profit before tax, regardless of the 
retention or distribution status (under the previous regime, 
however, the healthcare sector in particular was permitted to 
deduct re-investments from the taxable profit and this way 
reducing the effective rate). The change had an immediate 
impact on deferred tax asset and deferred tax liability balances 
(“deferred taxes”) attributable to previously recognised 
temporary differences, arising from prior periods. Under IFRS 
requirements, the new regime is considered to be substantively 
enacted in 2016, with its impact fully assessed in 2016. The 
Group has measured its deferred tax assets and liabilities as at 
30 June 2016. The Group estimated the portion of deferred tax 
assets or liabilities that it expected to utilise by 1 January 2017 
for its non-financial businesses (healthcare services and pharma 
businesses) and the portion of the deferred tax assets or 
liabilities it expects to utilise by 1 January 2019 for its financial 
businesses (medical insurance business). Based on such 
assessment, the Group has fully written off the unutilised 
portion of deferred tax assets and liabilities. The deferred tax 
liabilities that were reversed significantly exceeded the deferred 
tax assets written off. The net amount (“Deferred tax 
adjustments”) was recognised as an income tax benefit for the 
Group and amounted to GEL 24.0 million in FY16 – a positive 
effect of GEL 29.3 million was recorded in the first half of 2016 
was partially offset by a negative effect of GEL 5.3 million 
recorded in 4Q16. Both effects are non-recurring and one-off by 
nature and are fully utilised in 2016. Based on IFRS 
requirements, the negative impact recorded in 4Q16 represents 
a write off of the deferred tax asset that was originated in 4Q16 
but could not be utilised post 31 December 2016. As per 
International Financial Reporting Standards (“IFRS”), this is the 
last timing difference that GHG had on its balance sheet prior to 
moving to the new tax legislation, effective 1 January 2017 .
• We have completed the implementation of Exact, a new 
enterprise resource planning system (“ERP”) sourced from a 
Dutch supplier. It fully covers all financial functions (integrated 
internet banking, GL, receivables, payables, fixed assets, 
intangibles, shareholder’s equity, etc.) as well as all key 
operating functions (requesting, ordering, procurement and 
purchasing, warehouse management, sale and resale, cost 
accounting, stock item management, rents, depreciations, etc.). 
The ERP system enhances our capabilities to identify and extract 
further efficiencies in our operations. As a result, we run one 
ERP platform, Group-wide, except the pharma business. 
• We have also completed the implementation of Vabaco, a 
software package that includes a complete billing system, fully 
integrated human resource management system and fully 
integrated payroll module for the healthcare services business. 
Vabaco has been fully integrated with Exact in real time. With 
this approach our Group currently runs fully integrated ERP , 
billing, HRMS and payroll systems. Vabaco is fully integrated 
with all external payment channels. It covers Universal 
Healthcare Programme services as well as private services for 
the insured individuals and out-of-pocket coverage. It is running 
successfully in all of our healthcare facilities except three, where 
implementation is ongoing. As a result of implementing Vabaco, 
the entire healthcare services business now runs on one unified 
platform with substantially increased functionality, capacity 
and speed.  76

Discussion of segment results
The segment results discussion is presented for healthcare services 
business, pharma business and medical insurance business.
Discussion of healthcare services business results
Our healthcare services business consists of hospitals and 
ambulatory clinics and provides the most comprehensive range of 
inpatient and outpatient services in Georgia. We target the mass 
market segment through our vertically integrated network of 35 
hospitals and ten ambulatory clusters (with 41 ambulatory clinics), 
as at 31 December 2016. 
Healthcare services business revenue
Our healthcare services business recorded strong full-year  
2016 revenue of GEL 246.1 million (up 26.2%). The business 
continued its double-digit organic growth at 16.3% FY16.  
In 4Q 2016 revenue was GEL 67 .6 million (up 21 .9% y-o-y and  
up 14.0% q-o-q).
Revenue by types of healthcare facilities
GEL thousands, unless otherwise noted FY16 FY15 Change, y-o-y
Healthcare services  
revenue, net 243,453 191,424 27 .2%
Referral hospitals 209,563 168,527 24.4%
Community hospitals 22,273 17 ,623 26.4%
Ambulatory clinics 11,616 5,274 120.3%
Net healthcare services revenue grew by 27 .2% y-o-y in 2016. While 
all three types of healthcare facilities contributed to the growth, the 
largest driver was referral hospitals. Revenues from the ambulatory 
clinics more than doubled during 2016, which was a result of the 
roll out of the outpatient facilities network, in line with our strategy. 
The increase in revenue from referral hospitals was driven  
by strong organic growth, which was in turn driven by strong 
demand for our current services at our existing facilities, as well  
as renovation of our facilities and the launch of new services. Our 
renovation projects and our new services are described below 
under “Operating performance highlights and notable developments 
in 2016, healthcare services business” .
We expect a significant portion of the future growth of our 
healthcare revenue to come from referral hospitals, in line with our 
strategy to further invest in facilities and services and improve the 
quality of care throughout the country. In 2016, referral hospitals 
contributed 86% to total revenue from healthcare services.
Community hospitals also posted a strong growth in revenue, 
which was also driven organically. Community hospitals play a 
feeder role for the referral hospitals, so we expect more moderate 
future growth of their revenue. In 2016, community hospitals 
contributed 9% to total revenue from healthcare services.
Ambulatory clinics revenue has grown at triple-digit rates, 
driven by our rapid launch of ambulatory clusters, in line with 
our strategy to enter this highly fragmented segment of the 
healthcare ecosystem in Georgia and become a large-scale 
ambulatory player in Georgia. In 2016, we opened six ambulatory 
clusters, in line with our initial plan. These launches brought the 
number of ambulatory clusters to ten, consisting of 13 district 
ambulatory clinics and 28 express ambulatory clinics. We expect 
growth in revenue from ambulatory clinics to accelerate over the 
next few years, in line with our strategy to increase the number of 
ambulatory clusters and clinics from today’s level to more than 15 
and 40, respectively by the end of 2018. In 2016, ambulatory clinics 
contributed 5% to total revenue from healthcare services, 
compared to 3% in the previous year.

Performance
Our 2016 healthcare services revenue growth came from all 
three sources set out above, with revenue from out-of-pocket 
and private medical insurance outpacing the growth of revenue 
from Government-funded healthcare programmes. 
Universal Healthcare Programme continued to be the main 
contributor to our healthcare services revenue growth. The revenue 
increased by GEL 30.9 million or 21 .2%. Since the full rollout of 
UHC in mid-2014, Government expenditure on healthcare sector 
has grown considerably and is expected to be GEL 996.0 million  
in 2016 compared to GEL 487 .9 million in 2013, 104.1% growth  
over the period. 
Growth in out-of-pocket payments is driven by two main factors: 
The first is growth in healthcare spending which also drives 
co-payments which are funded out-of-pocket. UHC imposes 
coverage limits on medical treatments, establishes co-payments 
and has certain exclusions from coverage as well (i.e. charges that 
are not covered by UHC). Any charges in excess of the limits are 
covered by patients as co-payments on an out-of-pocket basis.  
With the increasing Government financing of healthcare services 
and rollout of outpatient facilities, the number of patients in our 
hospitals is growing, resulting in a corresponding increase in 
revenue from out-of-pocket payments as well. 
The second growth driver is the enhanced footprint of our 
ambulatory clinics, revenue from which is primarily out-of-pocket 
funded, as the Government provides minimal coverage for 
outpatient services. We expect the share of out-of-pocket payments 
and revenue from private medical insurance companies to increase 
over the next few years. Our existing ambulatory clinics and the 
further roll out of our ambulatory clinic expansion strategy will 
capture patients seeking elective outpatient services, as the largest 
proportion of elective outpatient services are still financed by the 
patients themselves or through private insurance policies. In a 
system where patients have free choice of providers we are 
pleased to see so many choosing the high-quality services in  
our ambulatory network. Our investments in new service 
developments are also expected to support growth in revenue from 
out-of-pocket payments as the services that we develop include 
those not financed by the State. Essentially, it is our priority to 
diversify the mix of payment sources contributing to our revenue, 
with an aim to decrease dependence on the revenue from the 
State, primarily UHC. Both the roll out of outpatient services and 
introduction of new services in hospitals not covered by UHC  
(e.g. IVF introduced earlier this year) deliver this goal. 
The y-o-y growth of revenue from private medical insurance 
companies also continues to be supported by the rollout of the 
ambulatory clinics, which attract patients with private medical 
insurance. Our ambulatory clinics are brand new, modern and 
provide a diverse range of services in one location, unlike the 
majority of the competition, and therefore is an attractive 
proposition for the insured customers. Our medical insurance 
clients have also increased the utilisation levels at our ambulatory 
clinics, which is reflected in the increased revenue from our  
medical insurance to our healthcare services business (up 176.7% 
and 1 .1% on y-o-y and q-o-q basis in 4Q16 and up 40.7% y-o-y in 
FY16). Consequently, we retain significantly more outpatient  
claims from our medical insurance business within the Group.  
The retention stood at 38.4% in FY16 (compared to 33.7% in FY15) 
and was 43.4% in 4Q16. 
The main cost drivers of our healthcare services business are the 
cost of salaries and other employee benefits and the cost of 
materials and supplies. The major drivers responsible for the 
increased costs in 2016 were the expansion of the hospital 
business, further to the acquisition of HTMC, filling the service 
gaps and the roll out of ambulatory clinics.
Our healthcare services margins are improving as a result of 
the increasing utilisation and scale of our business, as well as 
our continued focus on efficiency and the ongoing integration 
of healthcare facilities acquired during 2015. The share of the 
cost of salaries and other employee benefits in the total cost of 
services decreased from 63.4% in 2015 to 61 .7% in 2016. The 
direct salary rate in the healthcare services business (expense on 
direct salaries as a percentage of gross revenue) declined from 
34.9% in 2015 to 32.7% in 2016. The direct salary rate improvement 
is a result of scale efficiency and the fact that part of our direct 
salaries are fixed. We expect these two factors should continue to 
result in revenue growth that outpaces growth in direct salaries.
The cost of materials and supplies was well controlled, reflecting 
the benefits of consolidated purchasing power following the 
acquisition of the pharma business, and grew almost in line with 
the revenue growth. However the increasing materials rate during 
2016 over 2015 year, was a result of the reset of certain supplier 
prices on the back of Lari depreciation. 
The increase in cost of utilities is mainly due to the increase in 
utilities tariffs in the country effective from 4Q15, as well as to the 
expansion of the business. 
As a result of the above, gross margin (gross profit divided by 
gross revenue) increased by 280 bps y-o-y to 45.9% for 2016. 
Gross profit reached GEL 113.1 million for 2016, up 34.4% y-o-y.

The healthcare services business achieved a strong positive 
operating leverage of 17 .5% for the full-year 2016. This is a 
result of the increasing economies of scale as we continue the 
consolidation exercise Group-wide, as well as the disciplined 
cost management process. Salaries and other employee benefits 
and general and administrative expenses are the key drivers of our 
total operating expenses in healthcare services business. The FY16 
y-o-y cost growth is a result of an overall expansion of the 
healthcare services business.
Administrative salaries and other employee benefits in FY16 were 
well contained and were up only 4.2% y-o-y. The y-o-y increase  
in general and administrative expenses for FY16 (up 77 .1%) was 
primarily driven by the following factors: 1) increased governance-
related expenses as a result of the IPO at the end of 2015; 2) rental 
costs of the newly launched ambulatory clinics, with all rental 
payments denominated in Dollar, which is a common practice in 
Georgia; and 3) the recently increased marketing activity alongside 
the roll out of our ambulatory clinics, compared to a low base of 
marketing activity in the previous year. 
The full-year 2016 impairment charge was GEL 1 .9 million, down 
40.1% from a year ago, as a result of the normalisation of the 
quality of the regular retail receivables. 
As a result, we reported record high full-year EBITDA of GEL 
74.3 million (up 38.8% y-o-y). Our continued focus on efficiency 
and the integration of newly acquired facilities resulted in the robust 
healthcare services business EBITDA margin of 30.2% in FY16 
(31 .9% in 4Q16), which exceed the target of c.30% we set to meet 
by 2018.

The increase in depreciation expense in full-year is a result of the 
increased asset base from our expansion and respective capex 
pipeline execution. The decline in net interest expense reflects the 
reduction in our borrowing levels following the application of the 
IPO proceeds and replacement of the more expensive funding by a 
cheaper one. Foreign currency loss of GEL 4.3 million for the FY16 
was a result of depreciation of the local currency against Dollar. The 
loss was significantly mitigated by the currency forward (swaps) 
contracts with a total notional value of US$40 million that the Group 
entered into during 2016 (out of which US$9 million was formed by 
the end of December 2016), following the depreciation of the Lari. 
Consequently, we reported a profit GEL 64.5 million. Normalised 
full-year 2016 profit (adjusted for the impact of deferred tax and the 
foreign currency translation loss) was GEL 41 .6 million, up 145.2% 
y-o-y. 
Discussion of pharma business results
We entered the pharma business through the acquisition of GPC  
in May 2016, the third largest pharma retailer and wholesaler in 
Georgia, and our results of operations include GPC results since 
May 2016. Our pharma business (“GPC”) consists of retail and 
wholesale pharma distribution operations through 118 pharmacies 
mainly located in urban areas throughout Georgia, supported by 
two warehouses. 25 of these pharmacies also have express 
ambulatory clinics. We have approximately one million retail 
customer interactions per month in our pharmacies, with c.0.5 
million loyalty card members. The number of our pharmacies 
located at our hospitals has now reached 20, up from four in  
May 2016. 
In November 2016, we announced a second pharma acquisition, 
that of ABC, the fourth largest pharma retailer and wholesaler in 
Georgia. However, because we completed the ABC transaction  
in January 2017 the 2016 results below do not include the results  
of ABC’s operations – we started consolidating ABC from  
1 January 2017 . 
Since the GPC acquisition was in May 2016, y-o-y comparisons are 
not yet meaningful. For the period May-December, our pharma 
business recorded total revenue of GEL 133.0 million, with 20.7% 
gross margin and 4.3% EBITDA margin. The pharma business 
recorded revenue of GEL 56.6 million for 4Q16, maintained gross 
margin of 21 .4% during both 3Q16 and 4Q16, and improved 
EBITDA margin to 6.0% in 4Q16 from 3.9% in 2Q16.

Performance
During the second half of the year, GHG set a new incentive  
plan for the management of the pharma business and it actively 
engaged in marketing campaigns. The new incentive plan for the 
management is built around sales and efficiency KPIs. Most of  
the new marketing campaign has focused on sales initiatives. This 
resulted in revenue from our pharma business in 4Q16, which was 
up by 23.8% from third quarter. The revenue mix by sales channels 
was split between retail pharmacies and wholesale, at GEL 96.1 
million (72% of total) and at GEL 36.9 million (28% of total), 
respectively. The share of para-pharmacies in retail revenue  
was c.33%. 
Our pharma business reported a gross margin of 20.7%, in spite  
of the fact that in May-June period, after GHG announced its 
acquisition of the pharma business, gross margin was affected by 
the pricing pressure from the competition, as they started sales 
discounts. Gross margin stood at 21 .4% in 4Q16 when in May-June 
period it stood at 19.6%.
Overall, we improved performance and were disciplined  
on cost management, and as a result the pharma business 
delivered positive operating leverage of 10.2% in 4Q16  
over 3Q16. 
Since its acquisition in May 2016, we have integrated the 
pharma business into the Group. We have and are continuing 
to extract synergies in support functions and we are on track  
to deliver the initially expected cost savings and revenue 
enhancement. We have rolled out a number of initiatives, at the 
time of the acquisition, which have had a positive effect on the 
pharma business, and were partially reflected in 3Q16 and 4Q16 
results. GEL 5.7 million EBITDA (4.3% EBITDA margin) for the full 
consolidated period of pharma business reflects the achievements 
and improvements of its performance in 3Q16 and 4Q16 described 
above, compared to the period of May-June 2016. We expect that 
the effects of our optimisation and integration efforts will continue 
to be reflected in the full-year results of 2017 .
Discussion of medical insurance business results
Our medical insurance business consists of private medical 
insurance operations in Georgia, providing medical insurance 
products to corporate and retail clients. It is the largest provider  
of medical insurance in Georgia, with a 35.3% market share  
based on net insurance premiums earned and had approximately 
211,000 insurance customers as at 31 December 2016. Our medical 
insurance business plays a crucial role in our business model, as it 
is an important feeder for our healthcare services business, 
particularly for the ambulatory clinics, and we believe that role will 
grow in the future as we roll-out our ambulatory growth strategy.
Medical insurance business revenue 
Our medical insurance business contributed GEL 61 .5 million  
(up 5.0% y-o-y), to total consolidated GHG revenue.
Revenue by types of clients
GEL thousands, unless otherwise noted FY16 FY15 Change, y-o-y

Medical insurance products 
sold to retail clients 8,796 6,693 31 .4%
Medical insurance products 
sold to corporate clients 52,698 51,858 1 .6%
The y-o-y growth in medical insurance business revenue was 
driven primarily by sales to retail clients. Sales to retail clients 
posted 31 .4% y-o-y growth in FY16, while sales to corporate clients 
grew only modestly. The medical insurance business has been 
focused on diversification of its revenue by sources, launching 
insurance products particularly targeted at retail customers and 
enhancing retail sales efforts. As a result, revenue from retail sales 
reached 14% of total revenues in 2016, compared to 11% last year. 
We also increased our corporate client base and the number of 
insured individuals remained above 200,000 during 2016. 
Our medical insurance costs have been adversely affected in 
2016 by a loss-making contract with the Ministry of Defence 
(“the MOD contract”). The MOD contract has now expired and 
with the improved loss ratio in corporate sales, we expect 
increased efficiency in 2017 .

Gross profit 5,722 9,180 -37 .7%
Loss ratio 84.1% 78.7%
In spite of the MOD contract losses, our medical insurance 
business continued to focus on efficiency improvements in 2016, 
which was reflected in the improved loss ratio (net insurance claims 
divided by net insurance revenue) in 3Q16. Overall, however, the 
medical insurance loss ratio increased from 78.7% in FY15 to 
84.1% in FY16, mostly as a result of the 12.2% y-o-y increase in  
net insurance claims incurred, mostly from the MOD contract. 
The MOD contract was historically loss-making with a very  
low tariff base. The contract became even more unfavourable on  
1 May, 2016, when MOD beneficiaries were excluded from UHC 
coverage by the State. In addition, because the contract had a very 
limited possibility for Group-wide synergies – coverage did not 
include medicines and for outpatient services the insured used 
non-GHG clinics predominantly – the contract was allowed to expire 
in January 2017 . In the absence of this contract going forward,  
we expect significant improvement of our loss ratio in 2017 .
To reduce the risks associated with individual contracts (such as  
the MOD contract), diversifying our insurance portfolio is one of the 
key targets for our medical insurance business. By the end of 2016, 
we managed to reduce the concentration of our top five clients to 
27 .1%, down from 42.6% a year ago, measured by insurance revenue. 
We also improved the level of medical insurance claims 
retained within the Group. In 2016, our medical insurance claims 
expense was GEL 51 .7 million, of which GEL 22.7 million (43.9% of 
total) was inpatient, GEL 19.2 million (37 .1% of total) was outpatient 
and GEL 9.8 million (19.0% of total) accounted for drugs. In 2016, 
GEL 12.1 million, or 23.3% of our total medical insurance claims 
were retained within the Group, of which GEL 10.4 million and  
GEL 1 .6 million was retained in the healthcare services and pharma 
businesses, respectively. The feeder role of our medical insurance 
business is particularly important for our ambulatory services.  
In 2016, GEL 7 .2 million, or 37 .5% of our medical insurance claims 
on ambulatory clinics were retained within the Group, which 
represents an increase of 4.7 percentage points from 33.7%  
since FY15. With our recently launched ambulatory clinics and the 
ambulatory expansion strategy, the retention rate should improve 
further in the future, on a larger base, providing a significant 
revenue boost for our healthcare services business. In addition, 
following the expansion of our healthcare services business in 
referral hospitals in Tbilisi, where our medical insurance business 
has the highest concentration of its insured clients, more of our 
medical insurance customers will be utilising more of our hospitals. 
Our facilities are increasingly favoured by these customers over 
competitor facilities due to the better quality of service, access  
to a one-stop-shop style ambulatory clinics and ease of claim 
reimbursement procedures.
Gross profit recorded FY2016 was GEL 5.7 million, as a result  
of the increased revenues.
EBITDA, medical insurance business
GEL thousands, unless otherwise noted FY16 FY15 Change, y-o-y
Operating expenses (7 ,751) (6,567) 18.0%
Salaries and other  
employee benefits (4,663) (3,642) 28.0%

EBITDA (2,029) 2,613 NMF
Expense ratio 20.6% 18.0%
Combined ratio 104.7% 96.7%
The Group continues to decrease its general and administrative 
expenses in medical insurance, as a result of the efficiency-focus 
under a new leadership. The full annualised impact of this efficiency 
exercise will be reflected in 2017 . 
Our medical insurance business had made good progress on 
stabilising its earnings in the third quarter, when it recorded a 
positive EBITDA. However, our medical insurance business 
recorded GEL 2.0 million negative EBITDA. With the expiration of 
the MOD contract in January 2017 , we expect further significant 
improvement of the medical insurance business EBITDA in 2017 .  81

Senior Independent  
Non-Executive Director
Chairman’s Letter
Dear Shareholders,
On behalf of the Board, we are pleased to present the Governance 
Report for Georgia Healthcare Group PLC.
Our Board recognises the importance of, and is committed to, 
maintaining the highest standards of corporate governance.  
We report against the UK Corporate Governance Code (the “Code”) 
issued by the Financial Reporting Council (“FRC”) and we have 
adhered to high standards of compliance with the Code. We have 
been complying with the obligations applicable under the UK Listing 
Rules and Disclosure Guidance and Transparency Rules as a 
subsidiary of a parent company that has been listed since 
November 2006, when Bank of Georgia Holdings PLC (now named 
BGEO Group PLC) became the first Georgian company to list global 
depositary receipts on the London Stock Exchange. All Directors are 
fully aware of their duties and responsibilities under the UK 
Corporate Governance Code, Listing Rules and the Disclosure and 
Transparency Rules.
2016 has been the first full year as premium listed company and we 
have been building on the robust structure we had established prior 
to listing. Among the key corporate governance actions we have 
taken this year, we would like to highlight the following:
• We appointed an independent firm to conduct a formal 
evaluation of each Director’s skills and contribution and that of 
the Board as a whole and its Committees. We were pleased 
with the results of the evaluation and are confident that the 
Board has the right balance of skills, experience and diversity of 
personality and backgrounds to continue to encourage open, 
transparent debate and change.
• We have reviewed the strategic direction of the Group, including 
the increased ambulatory clusters, and the new services offered 
by the Group and considered the changing nature of the 
business and the impact for the risk framework.
• We have overseen the Group entering a new segment and 
engaged with the new management of the pharmaceuticals 
business to ensure alignment of the strategy for the Group. 
• The Board has ensured a sound system of control by 
maintaining an oversight of, and engaging at Board level and 
through its Audit Committee and Clinical Quality and Safety 
Committee with, the Internal Audit function and the Clinical 
Audit Process Unit to ensure that the coverage of its activities 
reflects the rapidly evolving business.
• We have received reports and discussed with management the 
improved controls and reporting in our hospitals and the 
harmonised health and safety procedures being put into place.
• We have overseen the reduction of exposure to foreign 
currencies in a difficult year for the Lari and approved the 
hedging and new funding arrangements put in place.
• We hosted an investor day in Tbilisi, which provided investors 
and analysts with the opportunity to receive an update from 
members of the Board and executive management on strategy, 
with almost 50 analysts and investors attending. Directors and 
management also met with shareholders in the United Kingdom, 
Europe, the United States and South Africa. 
Our principles extend beyond the boardroom and are continually 
implemented in the successful delivery of the Group’s 
strategic priorities.

Compliance statement
Throughout the year ended 31 December 2016 we applied the main Principles and complied with the Provisions of the 2014 UK 
Corporate Governance Code, save for section A.3.1 which recommends that the Chairman on appointment should be independent. 
Irakli Gilauri is the Company’s Chairman and at the time of appointment to this role also served as Chief Executive Officer of the 
Company’s principal shareholder, BGEO Group PLC. As such, the Board does not consider Mr Gilauri to be independent. Nevertheless, 
the Board believes that it is in the Company’s best interests to take advantage of Mr Gilauri’s capabilities and experience in leading 
the Board.
The Code and associated guidance is published by the Financial Reporting Council and is available at www.frc.org.uk.
Set out on our website at http://ghg.com.ge/page/id/134/corporate-governance-framework is the Board’s assessment of its application 
of the Main Principles of the Code, as required by LR 9.8.6. 82 
Georgia Healthcare Group PLC  Annual Report 2016  Governance
Directors’ Governance Statement continued
The role of the Board
Our principal duty, collectively, is to promote the long-term success of the Group by directing management in creating and delivering 
sustainable shareholder value. We do this by setting the Group’s strategy and overseeing its implementation by management and are 
accountable to shareholders for the financial performance of the Group. 
We believe that the success of the Group’s implementation of strategy requires the alignment of strategy with the Group’s internal 
governance framework. We view a strong risk management and internal control framework as essential to governance and it allows us  
to pursue our strategy in a way that risk appetite can be set and risks robustly identified, assessed, managed and reported effectively.  
You can read more about our risk management on pages 64 to 67 .
By setting the tone at the top, establishing the core values of the Group and demonstrating our leadership, management are able to 
implement key policies and procedures we have created in a manner that clearly sets an expectation that every employee act ethically  
and transparently in all of his or her dealings. This in turn, fosters an environment where business and compliance are interlinked.
We also monitor management’s execution of strategy and financial performance. While our ultimate focus is long-term growth, the Group 
also needs to deliver on short-term objectives and we seek to ensure that management strikes the right balance between the two.
Board of Directors

Overview Financial statements Additional information Governance
We are mindful of our wider obligations and consider the impact 
our decisions will have on the Group’s various stakeholders, such  
as our employees, our shareholders, our customers and patients,  
the environment and our community as a whole. You can read  
more about our sustainability initiatives in the Resources and 
Responsibilities section on pages 54 to 63.
In order to ensure that we meet our responsibilities, specific key 
decisions have been reserved for approval by the Board. A full 
formal schedule of matters specifically reserved for the Board can 
be found on our website, at http://ghg.com.ge/uploads/pages/
schedule-of-matters-reserved-for-the-board-81 .pdf. 
Outside these matters, the Board delegates authority for the 
day-to-day management of the business to the CEO. The CEO 
delegates aspects of his own authority, as permitted under the 
corporate governance framework, to the Management Board.
Operation of the Board
We schedule in person Board meetings at least four times a year  
in Georgia and London, for a period of one to two days each time. 
We also hold meetings at our London offices, with Directors either 
attending in person or via teleconference. Matters which require 
decisions outside the scheduled meetings are dealt with through 
additional ad hoc meetings and conference calls. In addition, in 
2016, the Board attended our annual investor day. In total, we met 
formally as a Board ten times during the year. The Board also 
passed written resolutions on five separate occasions.
At each regularly scheduled meeting, we receive reports from  
the Chairman, the CEO and the CFO. The CEO and the Deputy 
CEOs regularly update the Board on the performance, strategic 
developments and initiatives in their respective segment 
throughout the year. The CFO updates the Board on the financial 
position. The Director of the Legal Department and the Group Head 
of Investor Relations also regularly present to the full Board. The 
Board also receives updates from Group operating functions on 
internal control and risk management, compliance, internal audit, 
human resources and corporate responsibility matters.
There is an annual schedule of rolling agenda items to ensure that 
all matters are given due consideration and are reviewed at the 
appropriate point in the financial and regulatory cycle, although this 
is flexible to enable pressing matters, when they arise, to be dealt 
with in a timely manner. 
The Chairman and CEO seek input from the Non-Executive 
Directors ahead of each Board meeting in order to ensure that any 
particular matters raised by Non-Executive Directors are on the 
agenda to be discussed at the meeting. In addition, the Chairman 
meets with the CEO after each meeting to agree the actions to be 
followed up and to discuss how effective the meeting was. The 
Senior Independent Director supports the Chairman in his role and 
acts as an intermediary for other Non-Executive Directors when 
necessary and keeps in touch with the Non-Executive Directors 
outside of the Board and Committee meetings.
The Chairman and CEO also maintain frequent contact (in person  
or otherwise) with each other and the other Board members 
throughout the year outside of the formal meetings.
Board Committees
To assist the Board in carrying out its functions and to ensure there 
is independent oversight of financial, audit, internal control and risk 
issues, review of remuneration as well as oversight and review of 
Board and executive succession planning, the Board has delegated 
certain responsibilities to Board Committees. 
The Audit Committee oversees and challenges the Group in relation 
to its internal control and risk management systems in relation to 
the financial reporting process. Full details of the internal control 
and management systems in relation to the financial reporting 
process are given within the Audit Committee report on pages  
92 to 96.
In 2016, the Board had four Committees: the Nomination 
Committee, the Audit Committee, the Clinical Quality and Safety 
Committee and the Remuneration Committee. The Audit 
Committee and the Clinical Quality and Safety Committee are 
comprised solely of Independent Non-Executive Directors. Each 
Board Committee has agreed Terms of Reference, which are 
approved by each Committee and the Board and reviewed annually. 
Each Committee’s Terms of Reference can be found on our website 
at http://ghg.com.ge/page/id/129/terms-of-references.
The Chairman of each Board Committee reports to the Board on  
the matters discussed at Board Committee meetings. Later in this 
section you will find reports from the Chairman of each Board 
Committee which describe the Committee’s operation, activities 
in 2016 and priorities for 2017 .
In addition, each Board Committee provides a standing invitation  
for any Non-Executive Director to attend Committee meetings 
(rather than just limiting attendance to Committee members).

Directors’ Governance Statement continued
Board size, composition, tenure and independence
We consider that a diversity of skills, backgrounds, knowledge, 
experience, geographic location, nationalities and gender is 
important to effectively govern the business.
The Board and its Nomination Committee work to ensure that  
the Board continues to have the right balance of skills, experience, 
independence and Group knowledge necessary to discharge  
its responsibilities in accordance with the highest standards 
of governance.
We believe our overall size and composition to be appropriate, 
having regard in particular to the independence of character and 
integrity of all of the Directors. Each of our Non-Executive Directors 
occupies, and/or has previously occupied, senior positions in a 
broad range of relevant associated industries, bringing valuable 
external perspective to the Board’s deliberations through their 
experience and insight from other sectors enabling them to 
contribute significantly to decision-making. No individual or group  
of individuals is able to dominate the decision-making process and 
no undue reliance is placed on any individual. 
The average tenure of our Non-Executive Directors is less than two 
years as all were appointed in August or September 2015, prior to 
our admission to listing on the London Stock Exchange. We value 
diversity in all forms in accordance with our Board Diversity Policy, 
adopted last year. See page 91 for further details. 
We have assessed the independence of each of the six 
Non-Executive Directors and are of the opinion that each acts in  
an independent and objective manner and therefore, under the 
Code, is independent and free from any relationship that could 
affect their judgement. Each Non-Executive Director has an ongoing 
obligation to inform the Board of any circumstances which could 
impair his or her independence. 
Evaluation of Board performance
The Board continually strives to improve its effectiveness and 
recognises that its annual evaluation process is an important tool in 
reaching that goal. For 2016, we engaged Lintstock Ltd (“Lintstock”) 
an external effectiveness evaluation specialist, also engaged by our 
parent company, BGEO Group PLC, to conduct an evaluation of the 
Board; our Committees (Nomination, Audit, Clinical Quality and 
Safety and Remuneration); the Chairman; and the CEO. 
The first stage of the review involved Lintstock engaging with  
our Chairman and Company Secretary to set the context for the 
evaluation and to tailor the content of the surveys distributed to  
the Board. All Directors were requested to complete an online 
survey with questions and free text to expand on their answers. 
The anonymity of all respondents was ensured throughout the 
process in order to promote the open and frank disclosure of views.
Lintstock subsequently produced a report which addressed the 
following areas of Board performance:
• The composition of the Board, taking into account the Group’s 
strategic goals and diversity priorities;
• The relationships between the members of the Board and 
between the Board and management, as well as the 
atmosphere in the boardroom;
• The management of time of the Board, including the annual 
number of meetings, cycle of work, the Board’s agenda, as well 
as the content, format and timeliness of the Board packs;
• The support and training needs of the Directors;
• The clarity of the Group’s strategy, the Board’s testing and 
development of the strategy and the effectiveness with which 
the opinions of stakeholders are considered when drawing up 
the strategic plan;
• The risk appetite of the Board, the information provided to the 
Board to support its oversight of risk, and performance of the 
Board in identifying and managing the main risks facing 
the Group;
• The structure of the Group at senior levels, the succession 
planning for the CEO and key executive management positions;
• The Board’s exposure to management and the ability of the 
Board to evaluate executive management; and
• The composition and performance of the Committees,  
the performance of the Chairman and the CEO.
The results of the evaluations confirmed that the Board and the 
Committees were operating effectively. In particular, very good 
progress had been made in: (i) executing the Group’s strategy;  
(ii) succession planning for the Board and executive management; 
and (iii) oversight of risk management and internal controls.  
The successful entry into the pharma business through the 
strategic acquisitions of GPC and ABC was highlighted as an 
excellent achievement. 
No significant changes to the commitments of the Chairman  
or Non-Executive Directors were identified.
With respect to our objectives set for 2016:
• We closely monitored the execution of our strategy, in particular, 
the pharmacy acquisition and integration strategy and we were 
pleased with the progress made. 
• We dedicated more time to discuss risk management and 
internal controls and the new risk management function. 
• We added new executive management with expertise to further 
execute our strategy and strengthened management below the 
executive management level. 
We did not succeed in appointing an additional female Board 
member despite interviewing several female candidates for the 
auditing and/or accounting expertise appointment. We will actively 
continue our recruitment efforts.
The Board’s objectives for 2017 are: 
• Continuous review of overall strategy for the Group and monitor 
the implementation of the strategy and financial performance.
• Closely monitor the implementation of the restructured risk 
management function and the progress made by management 
to improve the Group’s risk management framework and 
systems of internal control;
• Focus on the integration of the pharma business sales and 
billing systems into the ERP platform; 
• Oversee the implementation of enhanced procedures, protocols 
and initiatives at our healthcare facilities; 
• Continue Board succession planning, with regard to gender 
diversity; 
• Enhance the talent, leadership and personal development 
programme and expand the programme to other members  
of management below the executive level.
It is envisaged that Lintstock will conduct a comprehensive review 
in respect of 2017 performance, which will include in-person 
meetings with the Board, in order to build upon the issues raised  
in this year’s process in greater depth. The review content for each 
subsequent evaluation is designed to build upon learning gained  
in the previous year to ensure that the recommendations agreed  
in the review are implemented.
Succession planning and Board appointments
We believe that effective succession planning mitigates the risks 
associated with the departure or absence of well-qualified and 
experienced individuals. We recognise this, and our aim is to ensure 
that the Board and management are always well resourced with the 
right people in terms of skills and experience, in order to effectively 
and successfully deliver our strategy. We also recognise that 
continued tenure brings a depth of Group-specific knowledge  
that is important to retain.  85

Overview Financial statements Additional information Governance
The Board Nomination Committee is responsible for both Director 
and executive management succession planning. There is a formal, 
rigorous and transparent procedure for the appointment of new 
Directors to the Board. More detail on the role and performance  
of the Nomination Committee is on pages 90 to 91 .
Non-Executive Directors’ terms of appointment
On appointment, our Non-Executive Directors are given a letter  
of appointment that sets out the terms and conditions of their 
directorship, including the fees payable and the expected time 
commitment. Each Non-Executive Director is expected to commit 
approximately 25-35 days per year to the role. An additional time 
commitment is required to fulfil their roles as Board Committee 
members and/or Board Committee Chairmen, as applicable. We are 
confident that all Non-Executive Directors dedicate the amount of 
time necessary to contribute to the effectiveness of the Board.  
The Letters of Appointment for our Non-Executive Directors are 
available for inspection at our Company’s registered office during 
normal business hours.
External appointments
Any external appointment or other significant commitment of a 
Director requires prior approval of the Board. Our Non-Executive 
Directors hold external directorships or other external positions but 
the Board believes they still have sufficient time to devote to their 
duties as a Director of the Company and believe that the other 
external directorships/positions held provide the Directors with 
valuable expertise which enhances their ability to act as a Non-
Executive Director of the Company.
Board induction, ongoing training, professional 
development and independent advice
On appointment, each Director takes part in an induction 
programme, during which he or she meets members of senior 
management below the Board level, receives information about  
the role of the Board and individual Directors, each Board 
Committee and the powers delegated to these Committees.  
He or she is also advised of the legal and other duties and 
obligations of a Director of a premium listed company. 
We are committed to the continuing development of our Directors 
in order that they may build on their expertise and develop an 
ever-more detailed understanding of the business and the markets 
in which Group companies operate. All of our Directors participated 
in ongoing training and professional development throughout 2016, 
which included briefings, site visits, development sessions and 
presentations by our Group Company Secretary, members of 
management, external speakers and our professional advisors. 
Information and support
All Directors have access to the advice of the Company Secretary 
and, in appropriate circumstances, may obtain independent 
professional advice at the Company’s expense. The appointment 
and removal of the Company Secretary is a matter reserved for  
the Board as a whole.
The Directors receive presentations from senior management on 
their particular area of the business.
Re-election of Directors
In line with the Code’s recommendations, all of our Directors seek 
re-election every year and accordingly all Directors will stand for 
re-election in June 2017 . The Board has set out in its Notice of 
Annual General Meeting the qualifications of each Director and 
support for re-election as applicable.
Annual General Meeting
The Notice of Annual General Meeting is circulated to all 
shareholders at least 20 working days prior to such meeting.  
All shareholders are invited to attend the Annual General Meeting 
where there is an opportunity for individual shareholders to 
question the Chairman and, through him, the chairs of the principal 
Board committees. After the Annual General Meeting, shareholders 
can meet informally with the Directors. 
As recommended by the UK Corporate Governance Code, all 
resolutions proposed at the 2017 Annual General Meeting will be 
voted on separately and the voting results will be announced to  
the London Stock Exchange and made available on the Company’s 
website as soon as practicable after the meeting. These will include 
all votes cast for, against and those withheld, together with all 
proxies lodged prior to the meeting.
See page 186 for further on Shareholder Information and on page 
99 for further on Shareholder Engagement.
UK Bribery Act 2010 (the “Bribery Act”)
The Board stands firmly against bribery and corruption and are 
committed to the Group acting in an ethical manner. To support  
this and in response to this legislation the Group has implemented 
and enforces its Anti-Bribery and Anti-Corruption Policy. The Board 
attaches the utmost importance to the Policy and its systems. The 
Company has also introduced a whistleblowing system, including 
an anonymous helpline, under its WhistleBlowing Policy. 
Directors’ responsibilities
Statements explaining the responsibilities of the Directors for 
preparing the Annual Report and consolidated and separate financial 
statements can be found on page 116 of this Annual Report.  
A further statement is provided confirming that the Board

Nomination Committee Report
Chairman’s Overview
I am pleased to present the Nomination Committee report for 2016.
The Nomination Committee focused on Board succession planning, 
having identified accounting and/or auditing experience and further 
diversification of the Board as key priorities, as well as senior 
management succession planning in line with our strategic 
objectives. We also reviewed the time commitment of the 
Non-Executive Directors, recommended to the Board the re-
appointments of all Non-Executive Directors at our AGM, and 
carried out our annual review of the Board Diversity Policy and 
facilitated the evaluations of the Board and our Committees, both 
externally and internally.
We successfully implemented our succession plan in respect of 
accounting expertise, with the addition of Paul Goldfinch, who was 
appointed as an advisor to the Board and a member of the Audit 
Committee from 1 January 2017 . Although we interviewed female 
candidates, we did not increase female representation on the 
Board. In 2017 , we will maintain gender diversity as a key focus for 
Board succession planning.
2016 was a year of great growth for the Group, including the 
addition of new business lines and the need for an expanded base 
of skills, knowledge and experience in senior management. We 
were particularly pleased to appoint a new Head of Clinical, a new 
CEO to lead our new pharmaceuticals business and a new CEO  
of Imedi L.
We were pleased to see the launch of the ambitious leadership 
programme, which is part of our vision for talent management  
and succession planning for the future of the Group.
As discussed on page 91, Lintstock performed a detailed review  
of the effectiveness of the Nomination Committee as well as the 
Board and other Committees. The results confirmed that the Board 
and Committees are effective and dedicated to best practice 
corporate governance.
I invite you to read more about our work in the following report.

At meetings, the Nomination Committee receives detailed reporting 
on potential leads for positions which they have identified may be 
necessary or useful for the Company. 
Meetings of the Nomination Committee take place prior to the 
Board meetings in order for the Committee to report its activities 
and matters of particular relevance to the Board.
Board Diversity Policy
The statement and objectives of our Board Diversity Policy are 
as follows:
Statement
Our Board embraces diversity in all its forms. Diversity of skills, 
background, knowledge, technical expertise, nationality, ethnicity 
and gender, amongst other factors, will be taken into consideration 
when seeking to appoint a new Director to the Board. 
Notwithstanding the foregoing, any Board appointment will always 
be made based on merit.
Objectives
• The Board should ensure the appropriate mix of skills and 
experience to ensure an effective Board.
• The Board should ensure that it comprises a majority of 
Directors who are independent in character and judgement.
• The Board aims to increase the number of women on the Board.
Board recruitment and appointment process
The Board has formal, thorough and transparent procedures in 
place for Board recruitment and appointment. As mentioned above, 
Company’s goal is to ensure that the Board is well balanced and 
appropriate for the needs of the business. The Nomination 
Committee has regard to the Board’s balance of skills, knowledge, 
experience and diversity, including gender. 
In identifying suitable candidates, we typically seek 
recommendations from trusted advisors but may also use open 
advertising or external search services to facilitate the recruitment. 
We carefully assess each candidate against our objectives and 
Board Diversity Policy, and take care that appointees have enough 
time available to devote to the position. 
Shortlisted candidates are generally seen first by the Chairman,  
the Chairman of the Nomination Committee, the Senior 
Independent Non-Executive Director and the CEO. If the selection 
process progresses further, each potential candidate is invited to 
meet other members of the Nomination Committee as well as 
members of management. We then decide whether to recommend 
an appointment first as an advisor to the Board and relevant 
Committees, with the Board deciding whether to extend an 
advisory agreement to the candidate. After serving as an advisor, 
the Nomination Committee will agree whether to recommend that 
the advisor be appointed to the Board. The Board will ultimately 
resolve whether to make the suggested appointment.
Nomination Committee activities in 2016
With respect to Board succession planning in 2016, we actively 
recruited an advisor to the Board and a member of the Audit 
Committee with accounting and/or audit experience in order to 
complement the skills that we identified as necessary for the Board 
and Audit Committee. 
Last year, we received the names of various candidates from our 
trusted advisors and shortlisted various candidates with accounting 
and/or auditing experience who had previously served as a chief 
financial officer or a member of Audit Committees. We follow our 
Board recruitment and appointment process as discussed above 
and through the recommendation of candidates, we interviewed 
candidates. The shortlisted candidates were seen by Neil Janin, 
Irakli Gilauri and David Morrison in London in October 2016 and the 
preferred candidate, Paul Goldfinch, was invited to speak with/meet 
other members of the Nomination Committee as well as members 
of management. We then decided to recommend Mr Goldfinch  
as an advisor to the Board and a member of the Audit Committee. 
The Nomination Committee is always mindful of its Diversity Policy 
when recruiting. We did not succeed in appointing an additional 
female Board member despite interviewing several female 
candidates for the auditing and/or accounting expertise 
appointment. We will actively continue our recruitment efforts.
We further strengthened our senior management team across the 
Group in line with the growth of the Group, new business lines and 
our strategic objectives. At executive management level we 
appointed Gregory (“Gia”) Khurtsidze as Chief Medical Officer/
Head of the Clinical Department from February 2016. Gia has more 
than 20 years’ of experience in leading healthcare institutions and 
an extensive and through knowledge of clinical practice as well as 
an understanding of the Georgian healthcare system, all of which 
has been of great benefit to the Group at both head office and 
hospital level.
The insurance business was strengthened by the appointment  
of Givi Giorgadze as CEO of Imedi L, who has nine years of 
experience in the insurance section and a further seven in 
wealth management.
The acquisition of the pharmaceuticals business required 
recruitment of leaders with the appropriate expertise and calibre. 
Mr Enrico Beridze, CEO of ABC for more than 15 years, was 
appointed in November (effective January 2017) to lead the 
combined pharmaceutical business, GEPHA, comprised of GPC  
and ABC. Mr Mikheil Abramidze, the COO of ABC will be in charge 
of the operations of GEPHA. Mr George Arveladze will be the 
Chairman of GEPHA. 
The Company has also strengthened its operations, insurance and 
commercial teams.
People development is key to Georgia Healthcare Group. In 2016 
we launched a leadership programme for mid level managers.  
25 managers embarked on the first stage, a management course  
of 180 hours over five to six months. The management course was 
designed by the Bank of Georgia university and tailored to the 
needs of the Group. In 2017 we aim to have an additional 50 
managers enrolled on the course and will also provide further study 
and growth opportunities for middle management as part of the 
leadership programme. The leadership programme form parts of  
our vision for talent management and succession planning for the 
future of the Group.
Committee effectiveness review
Lintstock performed the effectiveness review of the Committee. 
The evaluation principally addressed how effectively the Committee 
reviews the composition of the Board and the Board Committees 
as well as develops and implements succession plans for both the 
Board and executive management. 
The evaluation concluded that the Committee continues to operate 
and perform effectively.
Looking ahead to 2017
In the coming year the Nomination Committee will:
• Remain focused on the composition of the Board;
• Continue to develop Board and management succession plans 
in line with Group strategy for the medium to long-term; and
• Oversee the expansion of the talent development and leadership 
programme to members of management below the executive 
management level.
I look forward to reporting in next year’s Nomination Committee 
report the progress made by the Committee. 92

Audit Committee Report
Chairman’s Overview
Dear Shareholders,
2016 was the first complete financial year since we listed on the 
London Stock Exchange and also a time when our Group continued 
to rapidly evolve and expand. 
During the year, the Committee focused on fulfilling its core 
responsibilities in line with best practise corporate governance.  
We also prioritised understanding and meeting our increased 
obligations recently introduced by the new EU Audit regime.
We are proud of what we achieved in 2016. In particular:
• We reviewed the significant financial judgements made during 
the financial year and in the preparation of the Annual Report 
and Accounts, including in relation to revenue recognition, 
goodwill and the valuation of premises.
• We monitored the implementation of the business strategy and 
its impact on the Group’s internal control and risk management 
framework. The integration of IT and information systems across 
the Group and rollout of a new ERP system were two areas of 
particular focus due to our multiple acquisitions and entry into 
the pharma business.
• We worked with the Internal Audit function to enhance the 
scope and coverage of its activities to reflect the rapidly  
evolving business.
• We reviewed the process and timeline for assessing the 
effectiveness of the external auditor, conducted the review and 
made a final recommendation to the Board to re-appoint EY for 
the year ending 31 December 2017 .
• We revised our Policy on Non-Audit Services and Terms of 
Reference to align with the new EU Audit regime.
• At the request of the Board, we conducted a review of this 
Annual Report to confirm that it was fair, balanced and capable 
of being understood by shareholders.
In 2016, we successfully recruited a new Committee member with 
excellent audit and accounting experience. 
I now invite you to read more about our work in the following report.

In December 2016, the Board appointed Paul Goldfinch to serve as 
an advisor to the Board and as a member of the Audit Committee 
effective as of 1 January 2017 . Since his appointment, Mr Goldfinch 
has participated in all informal and formal meetings and actions of 
the Committee, including the finalisation of the Preliminary Results 
Release and Annual Report and has assisted the Committee in 
fulfilling its responsibilities.
We believe that the composition of the Audit Committee provides 
the range of financial and commercial expertise necessary for the 
Committee to operate effectively and fulfil its wide range of 
responsibilities. Each member has recent and relevant financial 
experience and Mr Goldfinch also has accounting and 
auditing experience.
The biographies of the Audit Committee members are set out on 
pages 86 and 87 .
The Audit Committee works to a planned programme of activities 
focused on key events in the annual financial reporting cycle and 
standing items that it considers regularly under its Terms of 
Reference. It also reacts to relevant business developments as and 
when they occur. Our meetings are regularly attended by the CFO, 
Head of Internal Audit, Director of Legal, Head of IT and 
occasionally by our CEO. Starting in March 2017 , our new Chief Risk 
Officer, a newly established role created to lead the re-structured 
Risk Management function (now integrated and centralised at the 
Group level), began attending Committee meetings. The external 
auditor also attends the Audit Committee meetings. During the 
year, we also regularly held separate private meetings with the 
head of Internal Audit and the external auditor. These sessions with 
the external auditor, which are not attended by management, allow 
us to discuss any issues of concern in more detail directly with the 
audit teams. From time to time, other members of management 
are invited to attend meetings in order to provide a deeper level  
of insight into any key issues and developments.
Meetings of the Audit Committee take place prior to the Board 
meeting in order for the Audit Committee to report its activities  
and matters of particular relevance to the Board.
Mr Morrison attends the AGM to respond to any shareholder 
questions that may be raised on the Audit Committee’s activities.
Key purpose and responsibilities
On behalf of the Board, the Audit Committee encourages and seeks 
to safeguard high standards of integrity and conduct in financial 
reporting, internal control and risk management (together with the 
Clinical Quality and Safety Committee) and internal audit. It also 
oversees the work of our external auditor. The Audit Committee 
reports to the Board on how it discharges its responsibilities and 
makes recommendations to the Board, all of which have been 
accepted during the year. 93

The Audit Committee’s full Terms of Reference are available

auditcommitteetermsofreference3-43.pdf.
Financial reporting
A principal responsibility of the Audit Committee is to consider the 
significant areas of complexity, management judgement and 
estimations that have been applied in the preparation of the 
financial statements. 
The Committee received detailed reports from the external auditor 
in respect of key areas of audit focus during the year. The 
Committee and the external auditor, without management present, 
discussed the key areas of audit focus, the suitability of the 
accounting policies which have been adopted and whether 
management’s key reporting estimates and judgements were 
appropriate. Taking into account the external auditor’s assessment 
of risk, but also using our own independent knowledge of the 
Group, we reviewed and challenged where necessary, the actions, 
estimates and judgements of management in relation to the 
financial statements. 
The significant risks and financial judgements considered by the 
Audit Committee in relation to the financial statements are 
addressed below.
Risk of fraud in revenue recognition
Management explained to the Committee the revenue recognition 
processes for the healthcare, pharma and insurance businesses. 
The Committee then reviewed in conjunction with management  
the design and operation of key controls, including the ERP solution 
introduced in the healthcare and insurance businesses in 2016. 
Although further improvements to the ERP solution will be made  
in 2017 as the platform is expanded to include the pharma business, 
no significant ERP weaknesses have been identified by 
management or Internal Audit to date and we believe the system  
is operating effectively. 
The Committee also discussed with the external auditors their 
review of the controls. On the basis of this review, the Committee 
concluded that these risks are appropriately managed. It noted that 
while the revenue recognition process in the newly acquired 
pharma businesses is functioning properly, the revenue recognition 
controls for the pharma business will be a key area of focus in 2017 
as ABC and GPC are merged and all sales and billing systems, 
amongst other software and applications, are integrated under 
one platform.  94 
Georgia Healthcare Group PLC  Annual Report 2016  Governance
Business combinations
During the year, the Group entered into the pharma business 
through the acquisition of GPC, acquired other smaller subsidiaries 
and finalised the acquisition accounting for LLC Deka and GNCo, 
which were both acquired in 2015. The Group also agreed in 2016  
to acquire a second pharma business, which was completed in 
early 2017 . 
In relation to the acquisition of GPC, the Committee reviewed with 
management the fair value of identifiable assets acquired (including 
any intangible assets) and allocation of the purchase price between 
identifiable assets and goodwill. 
Our management explained the methodology and assumptions 
underlying the calculation of fair value for each type of asset.  
The Committee also questioned management as to whether all 
intangible assets had been identified. Management provided a 
thorough explanation as to why no material intangible assets were 
identified and recognised from recent acquisitions. It was reported 
that all tangible fixed assets were recognised at fair value, based on 
independent appraisal reports. The Committee is comfortable that 
managements’ calculation of the fair value of assets acquired and 
the allocation to goodwill are appropriate.
Goodwill impairment
The Group carries goodwill on its balance sheet as a consequence 
of its acquisitions of the pharma business and numerous hospitals 
and other healthcare facilities. The Committee received a 
management report outlining the goodwill impairment assessment, 
the valuation methodology used, applicable assumptions and future 
cash flow projections. The sensitivity analysis used in determining 
goodwill impairment was also detailed. After challenging key 
assumptions, the Committee is satisfied that there was no 
impairment of goodwill impairment during the year.
Valuation of hospitals, clinics, land and office buildings
We received management reports on the assumptions to be used 
in valuing the Group’s hospitals, clinics, land and office buildings.  
In 2016, the Group engaged an independent external valuer to 
appraise 45 of its hospitals and clinics as well as land and office 
buildings. Management presented the results of the external 
valuation to the Committee. In respect of its hospitals and clinics, 
the appraisal value was approximately GEL 20 million higher than 
historical value. With respect to land and buildings, the valuation 
confirmed that any change in value was insignificant. 
Our auditors tested the valuation and reported its findings. We 
scrutinised and challenged management accordingly and we were 
satisfied with the assumptions and judgements applied. 
Disclosures in relation to our property valuations are set out in 
Notes 11 and 40 of the consolidated financial statements.
In addition to the significant financial judgements discussed above, 
we also discussed accounting and financial reporting matters 
relating to: 
• the classification of non-recurring income and expenses; 
• provisions for ongoing litigation;
• gains in foreign currency arising from hedge accounting; 
• changes in tax treatment of profit distributed as dividends and 
profit which is undistributed and reinvested; and
• the implementation timetables of IFRS 9, 15 and 16.
Internal audit
The Internal Audit function which was newly established in 2015 
has continued to evolve throughout 2016. The function is split into 
two different units: Clinical Internal Audit and Non-Clinical Internal 
Audit. Internal audits of clinical processes are reported directly to 
the Clinical Quality and Safety Committee and non-clinical internal 
audits are reported directly to the Audit Committee. 
The Non-Clinical division of the Internal Audit department serves  
as the Group’s independent assurance over the adequacy and 
effectiveness of the risk management processes and systems of 
internal control in place across the Group. The Audit Committee 
monitors the scope, extent and effectiveness of the Group’s 
Non-Clinical Audit function. The Committee reviews and approves 
the Non-Clinical Internal Audit Policy and oversees the Non-Clinical 
Internal Audit Plan, which is designed using a risk-based approach, 
aligned to the Group’s strategy.
The Non-Clinical Internal Audit department reviews a number of 
areas of risk pursuant to a programme approved by the Audit 
Committee. Throughout the year, we received regular reports from 
the Non-Clinical Internal Audit department on its audit activities and 
significant findings as well as the corrective measures 
recommended to management. We also reviewed and monitored 
management’s responsiveness to the corrective measures 
proposed through follow-up reports provided by Internal Audit. 
The Head of Internal Audit has direct access to the Audit 
Committee and the opportunity to discuss matters with the Audit 
Committee without other members of management present. We 
also monitor the staffing of the Non-Clinical Internal Audit 
department as well as the relevant qualifications and experience of 
the team. In 2016, we approved an increase in budget to ensure 
that staffing needs were met and that senior staff were sufficiently 
remunerated. The number of staff increased from three in 2015 to 
five at the end of 2016.
Throughout the year, we assessed the performance of our 
Non-Clinical Internal Audit function by measuring progress against 
the agreed plan, taking into account the rapid expansion of the 
Group. We also worked with the Head of Internal Audit to develop a 
more effective and efficient method of reporting. Consequently, the 
quality of reporting improved in 2016 and the Non-Clinical Internal 
Audit team was able effectively to address any unsatisfactory 
results highlighted. We concluded that the Non-Clinical Internal 
Audit function is effective and conforms to the standards set by the 
Institute of Internal Auditors. We think that although Non-Clinical 
Internal Audit improved its responsiveness to management needs 
in 2016, there is room for further improvement to ensure that it is 
fully respected by management, and this is an area we will be 
monitoring in 2017 . 
External audit
With respect to our responsibilities for the external audit process 
on behalf of the Board, we:
• approved the annual audit plan, which includes setting the areas 
of responsibility, scope of the audit and key risks identified;
• oversaw the audit engagement, including the degree to which 
the external auditor was able to effectively assess key 
accounting and audit judgements;
• reviewed the findings of the external audit team with the 
external auditor, together with the level of errors identified 
during the audit;
• monitored the responsiveness of the relevant management 
teams to the external auditor’s findings and recommendations 
along with any corrective measures taken; 
• reviewed the content of the management letter issued by the 
external auditor;
• reviewed the qualifications, expertise and resources of the 
external auditor;
• monitored the extent of the external auditor’s independence, 
objectivity as well as their compliance with ethical, professional 
and regulatory requirements;
• reviewed the level of audit fees and the cost-effectiveness of the 
audit; 
• monitored the rotation of key partners of the external audit in 
accordance with applicable legislation; and 
• recommended the appointment, re-appointment or removal, as 
applicable, of the external auditor.

Audit tender and lead audit partner rotation
EY was appointed as our Group statutory auditor in 2015 ahead of 
our listing on the London Stock Exchange, following a competitive 
tender process. The Group will be required to put the external audit 
contract out to tender no later than 2025. 
The Committee continues to review the services provided by the 
external auditor and will consider and provide advance notice when 
it considers it necessary to re-tender the position. 
The Committee confirms that it has complied with the 
requirements of the Audit Regulation (Regulation (EU) 537/2014) 
and Audit Directive (Directive 2014/56/EU) as implemented by the 
Statutory Auditors and Third Country Auditors Regulations 2016,  
for the year ended 31 December 2016. 
Following the retirement of Andrew McIntyre upon completion  
of the 2015 audit, EY appointed John Headley as our new lead 
audit partner.
Auditor independence
The Audit Committee is responsible for the development, 
implementation and monitoring of policies and procedures on the 
use of the external auditor for non-audit services, helping to ensure 
that the external auditor maintains the necessary degree of 
independence and objectivity. 
In 2016, we revised our policy on the provision of non-audit services 
by our external auditors to align with the new EU Statutory Audit 
regime and recent amendments to the UK Corporate Governance 
Code. Any work other than for audit or interim statements to be 
undertaken by the external auditor now requires authorisation by 
the Audit Committee except in very narrow circumstances. Further, 
the Policy on Non-Audit Services requires that fees incurred, or to 
be incurred, for work other than for audit or interim statements 
both individually and in aggregate, do not exceed the applicable 
limits in place as set out by European law. The Group’s current 
Policy on Non-Audit Services was revised and approved in 
December 2016 and can be found on our website at 
http://ghg.com.ge/uploads/pages/policyonnonauditservices34-48.pdf.
The Committee has undertaken a formal assessment of EY’s 
independence, which included a review of: a report from EY 
describing their arrangements to identify, report and manage any 
conflicts of interest, and their policies and procedures for 
maintaining independence and monitoring compliance with relevant 
requirements; and the value of non-audit services provided by EY . 
EY has confirmed that it believes it remained independent 
throughout the year, within the meaning of the regulations on this 
matter and in accordance with their professional standards. As 
indicated in Note 33 of the audited IFRS Financial Statements for 
2016, the total fees paid to EY for the year ended 31 December 2016 
were GEL 1 .63 million of which GEL 0.4 million related to the Group’s 
2016 half year interim accounts review. None of these fees related to 
work other than the audit or review of the interim accounts. 
Effectiveness
We have an established framework for assessing the effectiveness 
of the external audit process. This includes:
• a review of the audit plan, including the materiality level set by 
the auditors and the process they have adopted to identify 
financial statement risks and key areas of audit focus;
• regular communications between the external auditor and both 
the Committee and management, including discussion of regular 
reports prepared by EY;
• regular discussions with EY (without management present) and 
management (without EY present) in order to discuss the 
external audit process;
• a review of the final audit report, noting the conclusions reached 
by the auditors and the reasoning behind such conclusions;
• a review of EY’s 2016 Transparency Report and the annual FRC 
Audit Quality Inspection Report of EY; and
• a formal questionnaire issued to all Committee members and 
senior management of the Group who are involved in the audit 
(including internal audit) which covers among other items the 
quality of the audit and audit team, the audit planning approach 
and execution, the presence and capabilities of the lead audit 
partner, the audit team’s communication with the Committee 
and management and the auditors’ independence and 
objectivity.
After carefully considering the outcome of the above review, we 
concluded, in conjunction with management, and reported to the 
Board that in our opinion:
• the audit team was sound and reliable;
• the quality of the audit service provided was of a high standard;
• that EY continued to remain independent and objectivity; 
• that EY was effectively able to challenge management when 
required; and
• that productive discussions were held with the Committee 
throughout audit planning process.
The Committee has recommended to the Board that EY be 
re-appointed under the current external audit contract and the 
Directors will be proposing the re-appointment and the 
determination of EY’s remuneration at the 2017 AGM.
Whistleblowing, conflicts of interest and  
anti-bribery and anti-corruption policies  
and procedures
The Audit Committee ensures that there are effective procedures 
relating to whistleblowing. In particular, we have developed a 
Whistleblowing Policy which allows staff to confidentially raise any 
concerns about business practices confidentially through an 
independent whistle-blowing hotline. We keep this policy under 
review and receive regular updates from management as to any 
issues raised by employees. 
We have also developed a Conflicts Authorisation Policy through 
which we assess actual and potential conflicts of interest and assist 
the Board in its review of the permissibility of such conflicts.
The Audit Committee also keeps under review the Group’s Anti-
Bribery and Anti-Corruption Policy and procedures and receives 
reports from management on a regular basis in relation to any actual 
or potential wrongdoing. There were no significant findings in 2016.
Risk management and internal controls
The Audit Committee recognises that a strong and effective system 
of risk management and internal control plays a crucial role in a 
good system of Corporate Governance. Although the Board 
assumes the ultimate responsibility for the Group’s risk 
management and internal control framework, its work is supported 
by both the work of the Audit Committee and the Clinical Safety 
and Quality Committee. 
In relation to risk management and internal financial control, the 
Committee assists the Board in fulfilling its responsibilities with 
regards to seeing that there are adequate and effective controls in 
place within the Group’s financial reporting lines and within its 
operations. In particular the following operational risks are regularly 
reviewed: IT and information security (including the increasing 
threat of cyber-security), corporate security and any internal or 
external fraud or misconduct. The Committee also monitors the 
Group’s compliance with the corporate governance policies and 
procedures in relation to anti-bribery and anti-corruption, conflicts  
of interest and whistleblowing.  96 
Georgia Healthcare Group PLC  Annual Report 2016  Governance
The Committee is supported by a number of sources of internal 
assurance within the Group in order to discharge its responsibilities. 
As described earlier in this Report, this includes reports from and 
regular discussions with the Group executives with whom the 
Committee members regularly meet. We receive Internal Audit’s 
reports on the control environment and, as mentioned earlier, we 
approve the Non-Clinical Internal Audit Plan which is risk-based and 
is aligned to the Group’s strategy. 
The findings of each completed internal audit in 2016 (see 
subsection “Internal Audit” on the previous page) were presented 
to the Committee and included a recommended management 
action plan in relation to any weaknesses identified. Our Internal 
Audit team regularly reported to the Committee the progress made 
by management in implementing any such action plans until each 
audit issue identified was fully resolved. The Committee is pleased 
to report that during 2016 and up to the date of this Annual Report, 
our Internal Audit team did not find any significant weaknesses in 
our risk management processes or internal controls.
The Committee has also considered and confirmed to the Board 
that its work is performed in accordance with the provisions in the 
Code and the Financial Reporting Council’s (“FRC”) associated 
Guidance on Risk Management, Internal Control and Related 
Financial and Business Reporting. Based on the above, we are 
satisfied that our overall internal control framework is effective. 
In 2017 , the Group will be implementing a fully restructured risk 
management function, aimed at centralising the assessment of risk 
management and the framework and systems of internal control at 
the highest level of Group executive management. A newly created 
role of Chief Risk Officer was established and our CFO assumed 
this role in March 2017 . Policies, procedures and internal controls 
are being implemented to establish a consistent application 
throughout the Group. In centralising these functions and putting in 
place an integrated risk management framework and systems of 
internal control at Group level, as opposed to independent risk 
management within each business unit, we aim to achieve the 
earlier identification of risk, faster mitigation and harmonised 
risk reporting.
Continuing education and training
Throughout the year, the Audit Committee received presentations 
and training from the PLC Legal and Compliance/Company 
Secretariat department in respect of recent EU Audit Reforms, 
amendments to the Companies Act 2006, Disclosure Guidance and 
Transparency Rules and UK Corporate Governance Code as well as 
the revised FRC publications. Discussions principally focused on 
changes applicable to the Committee and its accountability and 
addressed: (i) Committee competence and composition; (ii) key 
judgments; (iii) risk management and internal control systems; (iv) 
internal audit; (v) non-audit services; and (vi) appointment of the 
external auditor and retendering. 
Viability statement
In accordance with the revised Code, the Directors are required to 
assess the viability of the Group. We spent time considering the 
timeframe over which the viability statement should be made as 
well as an assessment underlying the period of coverage, which we 
agreed should be three years, which corresponds to the Group’s 
business planning cycle. 
In particular, we looked closely at the Group’s principal risks and 
uncertainties, including those that will threaten our business model, 
future performance and solvency or liquidity; the current financial 
position of the Group, including future cash flows, allocated capital 
expenditure and funding requirements; future prospects; and 
downside stress testing. We discussed our analysis with 
management and the full Board. The viability statement is set out 
on page 67 .
Fair, balanced and understandable reporting
At the request of the Board, we reviewed the 2016 Annual Report 
to consider whether it provided a true and fair view of the Group’s 
affairs at the end of the year and provided shareholders with the 
necessary information in a fair, balanced and understandable way in 
order to enable them to assess the Group’s performance, business 
model and strategy.
We did this by satisfying ourselves that there was a robust process 
of review and challenge at different levels within the Group to 
ensure balance and consistency. We reviewed several drafts of the 
2016 Annual Report and directly reviewed the overall messages and 
tone of the Annual Report with the CEO and CFO. We also 
considered other information regarding the Group’s performance 
and business presented to the Board during the period, both from 
management and the external auditor. After consideration of all of 
this information, we are satisfied that, when taken as a whole, the 
Annual Report and Accounts is fair, balanced and understandable, 
and provides the information necessary for shareholders to assess 
the Group’s performance, business model and strategy.
Committee effectiveness review 
An externally facilitated review of the Committee was performed by 
Lintstock. The evaluation principally addressed the composition of 
the Committee, the review and testing of the work of the internal 
and external auditors as well as the quality of financial reporting, 
the assessment of internal controls and risk management within 
the scope of the Committee’s responsibilities as well as the division 
of responsibilities between the Committee and the Clinical Quality 
and Safety Committee. The effectiveness evaluation concluded that 
the Committee operates and performs effectively. 
Based on the results of the evaluation and further internal 
discussion, our priorities for 2017 are to: 
• continue to improve the Group’s risk management framework 
and systems of internal control;
• focus on the integration of the pharma business sales and billing 
systems into the ERP platform; and
• support the delivery of a comprehensive internal audit 
programme to ensure that the scope and coverage of the 
department’s work reflects the growth of the Group and addition 
of new business lines.

Clinical Quality and Safety Committee Report
Chairman’s Overview
I am pleased to present the Clinical Quality and Safety Committee’s 
report. The Clinical Quality and Safety Committee supports the 
Board in overseeing the Group’s non-financial risks and their 
associated risk management framework including the related 
governance, internal control systems and assurance. The 
Committee’s work aims to promote a culture where quality and safe 
patient care are at the centre of management’s actions.
Excellent progress has been made in analysing our growing number 
of clinical facilities and understanding where the Group can 
harmonise or advance its framework, especially with the addition of 
the pharma businesses. I am pleased to say that the Clinical 
Process Audit Unit of our Internal Audit team undertook and 
regularly reported to the Committee on their extensive programme 
of audits including medical document maintenance processes, 
controlled drugs management processes, management process for 
damaged and expired drugs in pharmacies, regulatory compliance 
and follow-up audits of identified areas for improvement.
Our employees have been excellent in their supportiveness and 
openness in respect of these audits and our subsequent 
Committee enquiries and we are working with the relevant 
employees to help achieve more uniformity across the Group in our 
methods of reporting and to ensure we embed robust processes 
and practices.
The Committee has received regular reports from the Head of 
Clinical Department/Deputy CEO to ensure a good flow of 
information on data points, reporting procedures and to consider 
the many initiatives he is leading to develop the risk framework for 
the Group. This year the foremost initiatives were an extensive 
training around infection control and establishing effective reporting 
mechanisms and culture for mortality rates in referral hospitals.
Committee members also met with the Heads of the Group’s 
clinical teams individually to gain a greater understanding of how 
clinical governance is working within each clinical specialty and to 
consider how the Group can continue to improve through this 
period of rapid growth. In addition we have visited several of the 
sites throughout the last year to review facilities and practices and 
to talk to doctors about their work.
I invite you to read more about these and the other main activities 
of the Committee in the report below.

Chairman of the Clinical Quality and Safety Committee
The role of the Clinical Quality  
and Safety Committee
The role of the Clinical Quality and Safety Committee is to assist the 
Board in fulfilling its responsibilities in relation to the oversight of the 
Group’s non-financial risks and their associated processes, policies and 
control including monitoring the Group’s clinical quality, internal control 
and assurance frameworks. The Committee also assists the Board in 
promoting a culture of high quality and safe patient care and 
experience.
The key responsibilities of the Clinical Quality and Safety 
Committee are to:
• review the Group’s clinical performance;

report these to the Board;
• review evidence of compliance with statutory notification 
requirements and responses to any statutory notices issued by 
authorities and report these to the Board;

and Group policies and procedures in respect of clinical care and 
quality, and annually the Group’s clinical risk management and 
internal control procedures;

arrangements, policies and performance, including carbon 
reduction policy.
In discharging its duties, the Committee engages with and receives 
regular reports from the Head of Clinical Department/Deputy CEO 
and supervises the clinical quality aspects of internal audit (the 
organisational and reporting structure of the internal audit 
department is set out on page 65).
The principal risk categories overseen by the Clinical Quality and 
Safety Committee include medical and clinical, record-keeping and 
similar statutory compliance, health and safety, facilities and plant 
(the Audit Committee oversees financial-related risks, IT , cyber 
security, compliance and similar areas of operational risks).
The responsibilities and functioning of the Committee are governed 
by a formal terms of reference approved by the Board which is 
subject to regular review. The Clinical Quality and Safety 
Committee’s full terms of reference are available from the Group’s

the latest internal audits and the audit plan and forward-looking 
priorities. 
Meetings of the Clinical Quality and Safety Committee take place 
prior to the Board meetings in order for the Committee to report  
its activities and matters of particular relevance to the Board.
Clinical Quality and Safety Committee  
activities in 2016
Good progress has been made in understanding our growing 
number of clinical facilities and by an extensive internal audit 
programme to understand where the Company can improve. I am 
pleased to say that the Clinical Process Audit Unit of the Internal 
Audit team undertook and reported to the Committee on audits 
including medical document maintenance processes, audit of 
patient referral management, controlled drugs management 
processes, audits in respect of regulatory compliance, deep dive 
audits in certain hospitals and follow-up audits of identified areas for 
improvement. 
Additionally the Committee is kept informed on the Ministry of 
Health’s regulatory visits, inspections and reports on the facilities of 
the Group. The Clinical Process Audit Unit of the Internal Audit team 
reports to the Committee on these matters and the Group’s 
participation on these discussions with the Ministry of Health and 
audits arising from regulatory matters. 
The Head of Clinical Department/Deputy CEO attended the Clinical 
Quality and Safety Committee meetings at least every quarter to 
inform the Committee of data points, on clinical governance and to 
keep the Committee appraised of any developments. His focus this 
year, in relation to clinical risks, has been on infection control and 
prevention, quality management and patient safety and the Clinical 
Department has launched a number of initiatives and reported on 
their progress and the goals achieved to the Committee. 
The Committee has considered health and safety policies and 
procedures, advising on amendments to reflect best practices, 
standardisation across hospitals and units and changes in 
regulatory compliance. 
The Group commissioned patient satisfaction surveys at a sample 
outpatient clinic using randomly selected participants and compared 
the results to a survey carried out in 2014. The Committee 
considered this a useful exercise as it was able to consider and 
understand the patient experience better, what was successful, 
whether patient expectation had evolved and where there may be 
potential for improvement.
Committee members also met with the heads of the following 
departments individually: Internal Medicine Department and 
Ambulatory Services, Quality Assurance and Analysis Division, 
Nursing, Maternal and Child Health, Emergency Care, Post Diploma 
Training and Accreditation and Laboratory and Transfusion. They also 
met with the Operations Team. This engagement gave the 
Committee a better understanding of how clinical governance 
works in these departments. The Committee heard about the 
impact, in practice, of the education and training programme, which 
helped the Committee to form views on how cross-departmental 
interactions of this expanding Group could be advanced.
Through formal communications, in the lead up to meetings and  
in meetings and ad hoc interactions, the Committee, believes that  
it has received sufficient, relevant and reliable information from 
management, internal audit and the clinical team to enable us to 
discharge our responsibilities.
Committee effectiveness review
Lintstock performed the effectiveness review of the Committee. 
The evaluation principally addressed the composition of the 
Committee, the testing of the work of Clinical Process Unit of the 
Internal Audit team, the assessment of internal controls and risk 
management related to clinical quality and health and safety as well 
as the division of responsibilities between the Clinical Quality and 
Safety Committee and the Audit Committee. 
The evaluation concluded that the Committee operates and 
performs effectively.
Looking ahead to 2017 
The Clinical Quality and Safety Committee considered its priorities 
for 2017 and its focus for the coming year is:
• Ensuring that the Group has the correct procedures and 
protocols for health and safety, in order to ensure a high quality 
service to patients and ensure the safety of all staff;
• Infection control initiatives and procedures;
• Implementing protocols in key clinical risk areas;
• Ensuring that effective and consistent drugs management 
controls are in place, both within hospitals and the Pharma 
businesses;
• Audit of our intensive care units in referral hospitals; and
• Continuation of our audit programme to ensure clinical process 
compliance with regulatory requirements.
The Committee will continue to meet ahead of the Board meetings 
to ensure a timely flow of information on clinical governance to the 
Board and so that the Committee can make its recommendations 
on any matters reserved to the Board in a timely manner.

Shareholder Engagement
The Company has a comprehensive shareholder engagement 
programme and maintains an open and transparent dialogue with 
existing and potential shareholders, a responsibility that the 
Company takes very seriously. 
The Board’s primary contact with institutional shareholders is 
through the Chairman, Senior Independent Non-Executive Director, 
CEO and Head of Investor Relations, each of whom provide a 
standing invitation to shareholders to meet and discuss any matters 
they wish to raise. Our Committee Chairmen also make themselves 
available to answer questions from investors.
We formally communicate with our shareholders via our AGM, 
Annual Report and Accounts, Half-Year Report and Interim 
Management Statements. These are supported by a combination of 
presentations and telephone briefings. Over the course of the year, 
we met with over 150 institutional investors, and participated in 
more than ten investor conferences and road shows around the 
world. Our Directors and management met with shareholders in 
the United Kingdom, Europe, the United States and South Africa. 
In November 2016, GHG hosted an investor day in Tbilisi, which was 
open to all investors and analysts. This investor day provided the 
opportunity for investors to receive an update from the Board and 
executive management on strategy and performance as well as 
meet informally with Board members and raise matters of interest. 
GHG was pleased to host almost 50 analysts and investors at the 
investor day.
In addition to our shareholders, we meet and present to analysts 
throughout the year and hold regular meetings with the Group’s 
existing lenders and actively engage with potential lenders to 
discuss our funding strategy. Our Group Company Secretary also 
has ongoing communication with the shareholders’ 
advisory groups.
The Chairman has overall responsibility for ensuring that the Board 
understands the views of major stakeholders. The full Board is 
regularly kept informed of these views by the Chairman as well as 
executive management and the Investor Relations team and, to the 
extent deemed appropriate, issues raised at these meetings have 
been adopted by the Group. Informal feedback from analysts and 
the Group’s corporate advisors is also shared with the Board.
Our website http://ghg.com.ge provides our stakeholders with 
access the Group’s results, press releases, investor presentations, 
analyst reports, details on our corporate governance and corporate 
and social responsibility framework, our leadership, as well as other 
information relevant to our stakeholders. We also ensure that 
shareholders can access details of the Group’s results and other 
news releases through the London Stock Exchange’s Regulatory 
News Service. 100

Remuneration Report
Chairman’s Overview
Dear Shareholders,
On behalf of the Board, I am pleased to present you with the Directors’ 
Remuneration Report for the Group. At the 2016 AGM, our Directors 
Remuneration Report and Directors’ Remuneration Policy (“Policy”) 
were each approved by you and the latter was adopted for a three-year 
period from the date of the meeting. Y our strong support – the 
shareholder vote was more than 96% in favour – affirmed that this is 
the right policy for our Group, striking a balance between rewarding 
achievement and aligning the interests of executive management with 
our shareholders to promote the long-term interests of the Group. 
 
The structure is comprised of two core elements:
• salary compensation consisting of a modest cash sum and 
deferred shares that vest over a five-year period; and
• discretionary compensation payable entirely in deferred shares 
which vest over a three-year period. Discretionary compensation is 
dependent on both Group performance and on the executive 
achieving his or her KPIs in each financial year. 
We pay no cash bonuses, which is another distinguishing feature of 
our structure, and in contrast to many other UK companies, the Group 
does not operate a long-term incentive plan (“LTIP”). As a very 
significant percentage of an executive’s compensation is in the form 
of deferred shares with long vesting periods, executive management 
are continuously incentivised to create value for the long-term. The 
importance of creating sustainable long-term value guards against an 
executive taking risks that endanger our long-term stability. 
Although members of executive management below the Board level 
are outside the scope of our Policy, we equally apply the structure of 
the Policy to them. The Policy supports our corporate culture which 
focuses executives on team performance that creates value (for both 
shareholders and the executives) when the Group succeeds over the 
long-term. Long-term value creation aligns directly with the interests 
our the shareholders. There have been no substantial changes to the 
directors’ remuneration made during 2016. 
What is in this report?
This Directors’ Remuneration Report describes the implementation of GHG’s Directors’ Remuneration Policy and discloses the amounts 
earned relating to the year ended 31 December 2016.
The report complies with the provisions of the Companies Act 2006 and Schedule 8 of The Large and Medium-sized Companies and 
Groups (Accounts and Reports) Regulations 2008. The report has been prepared in line with the recommendations of the Code and the 
requirements of the UKLA Listing Rules.
The Directors’ Remuneration Policy was approved by shareholders in a binding vote at the 2016 AGM and took formal effect from the 
date of approval and will apply until the 2019 AGM, at which time we will be required to submit our Directors’ Remuneration Policy for 
approval by shareholders. Our Directors’ Remuneration Policy has again been included in this report (set out on pages 107 to 113) for the 
purposes of clarity and transparency.
The Annual Report on Remuneration (set out on pages 100 to 115) (which includes the Annual Statement by the Chairman of the 
Remuneration Committee set out on page 100) will be subject to an advisory vote at the 2017 AGM.
In 2016, our CEO Nikoloz Gamkrelidze remained the sole Executive 
Director of our Group. We believe that the combination of the 
substantial number of deferred salary shares and the potential to earn 
discretionary deferred shares of a significant value continues to keep 
Mr Gamkrelidze (and our executive management team) highly 
motivated and aligned with shareholders. 
One of the most important matters covered by the Remuneration 
Committee in 2016 was the consideration and award of discretionary 
deferred shares for Mr Gamkrelidze. The Remuneration Committee 
judged his performance to be excellent. In 2016, Mr Gamkrelidze met 
or exceeded most of his KPIs, which are set out in section 3.2 along 
with detail showing how he reached these targets. 
Under Mr Gamkrelidze’s direction, the Group achieved 16.3% organic 
growth alongside record revenue, driven by the acquisition of GPC, the 
third largest pharmaceutical retailer and wholesaler in Georgia. The 
successful integration of GPC, another of Mr Gamkrelidze’s KPIs, has 
exceeded expectations to date in capturing synergies for the Group. In 
2016, the Group signed a binding agreement to acquire ABC, the 
fourth largest pharmaceutical retailer. The acquisition of ABC was 
completed in January 2017 and the integration of the pharmaceutical 
businesses are underway. Mr Gamkrelidze’s leadership in driving the 
Group’s strategy and ambition positions GHG well for the future as the 
largest healthcare services provider in Georgia.
The Group also met its target of adding six ambulatory clusters in line 
with the strategy for outpatient services and added to the quality 
healthcare services it can offer its patients. Mr Gamkrelidze has also 
led a range of talent development and retention initiatives, from 
addition of new specialities and incentives in the residency 
programme through to the training of physicians, nurses and 
administrative employees at the EVEX learning centre. We particularly 
noted his launch of the leadership programme for mid-level managers, 
which requires a high degree of commitment from the Group and 
participants for their joint future.
Further important matters covered in 2016 by the Remuneration 
Committee include the evaluation of executive management 
performance and approval of discretionary share awards. The 
performance of the executive management team was vital to the 
success of the Group in 2016. 
I would like to thank our Executive Director and the executive 
management team, and all of the Group’s employees, for their hard 
work and dedication in making this such a successful year for the 
Group financially and also in shaping the Group for the future. I 
would also like to thank the shareholders for their support of our 
policy last year.

and Lari as applicable, converted into the respective currency as described in Note 2 of the table in section 6.2 of the Policy. Accordingly, there may be variations in the 
numbers above and those provided in the accounts.
2  Deferred share salary. The figures show the value of GHG shares underlying nil-cost options granted under the Executive Director’s service contract with JSC GHG in 
respect of service in the relevant year. For both 2016 and 2015, Mr Gamkrelidze was awarded 175,000 deferred share salary shares. The value attached to each GHG 
share is calculated by reference to the share price as of 12 November 2015, the date of admission to listing, which was US$2.58298 (based on the official share price  
of GBP 1 .7 per share converted into Dollars using an exchange rate of 1 .5194, being the official exchange rate published by the Bank of England on the same date). 
3  Discretionary deferred share compensation. The figure shows the value of GHG shares underlying nil-cost options granted in respect of service in the relevant year.  
The discretionary deferred share compensation award is capped at 100% of total salary. For 2016, options were awarded over 141,981 GHG shares. The value of the 
discretionary deferred share compensation is calculated by reference to the share price on 28 February 2017 , which was US$4.52998 (based on the official share price  
of GBP 3.64 per share converted into Dollars using an exchange rate of 1 .2445, being the official exchange rate published by the Bank of England on the same date).  
For 2015, options were awarded over 237 ,500 GHG shares. The value of this discretionary deferred share compensation is calculated by reference to the share price on 
15 February 2016 which was US$2.5303 (based on the official share price of GBP 1 .7388 per share converted into Dollars using an exchange rate of 1 .4552, being the 
official exchange rate published by the Bank of England on the same date). Discretionary compensation in respect of 2016 is subject to three-year straight line vesting 
beginning in January 2018, subject to the leaver provisions described in section 4.5(b) of the 2016 Policy. The means of determining the number of shares underlying 
this compensation and the terms and conditions are described in section 4.2(b) of the 2016 Policy. The basis for determining Mr Gamkrelidze’s 2016 discretionary award 
is described in section 3.2 below.
4 Benefits. The figure shows the gross taxable value of health and disability insurance, Directors’ and Officers’ liability insurance and tax equalisation payments.
5 Pension. The figure shows the aggregate employer contributions for the relevant years into the Group’s defined contribution pension scheme. Under the Group’s defined 
pension scheme the normal retirement age is 65.
6 Mr Gamkrelidze was reimbursed for reasonable business expenses, on provision of valid receipts.

Talent development and retention Delivery on strategy Met expectations including introducing
coaching and leadership programme
In addition to the KPIs listed in the table above, the Committee considers non-tangible factors such as leadership and forward-looking 
strategy development when determining Mr Gamkrelidze’s discretionary compensation. Mr Gamkrelidze’s KPIs largely track the Group’s 
KPIs as he is expected to deliver on the Group’s strategy, so that more information on the performance against the KPIs can be found in 
other sections of this Annual Report. 
In respect of 2016, Mr Gamkrelidze met or exceeded most of his KPIs. The financials were very strong, with Mr Gamkrelidze reaching or 
exceeding all his financial targets except in insurance, where a changing market, a single important contract and legacy pricing have all 
slowed the hoped for turnaround in our smallest business segment.
Mr Gamkrelidze also delivered on the entirety of his challenging set of operational targets from the healthcare facilities and services rollout 
to the integration of our GPC pharma business. The sole missed target here was the Deka hospital renovation project which is delayed for 
reasons outside Mr Gamkrelidze’s control. 
And over and above the KPIs in the pharma business, Mr Gamkrelidze seized a key strategic opportunity with the ABC acquisition for which 
a binding agreement was signed in November 2016 (and which was successfully completed in early January 2017). This was a major project 
that the Board and the Committee are particularly pleased to have seen led to a successful conclusion. 
On Mr Gamkrelidze’s last KPI, GHG has launched a series of initiatives to ensure it attracts, retains and develops its talent. 
• The Group has added seven new specialities offered in the residency programme, bringing the total number to 20 and added further 
incentives. The Group has also introduced a new share plan for doctors. The EVEX Learning Centre trained a total of 2,299 nurse-
participants, 2,035 physicians and 937 administration employees.
• During the second half of the year GHG set a new incentive plan for the management of the pharmacy business, built around sales and 
efficiency KPIs, helping the Group increase revenue by 23.8% for the pharma business quarter-on-quarter. 
• The Group offered executive coaching to top level management and in 2016 GHG launched an ambitious leadership programme for 
mid-level managers for which 25 managers (largely hospital CEOs) embarked on the first stage – a management course of 180 hours 
over five to six months.

As a result, the Committee determined that Mr Gamkrelidze’s performance as excellent and determined that Mr Gamkrelidze should be 
awarded discretionary deferred share compensation of 141,981 shares valued at US$643,171 . This amounted to 95% of his maximum 
opportunity. See section 4.2(b) of the Policy which describes why the Remuneration Committee steers away from strict weighting of the 
performance measures and the discretion it retains in respect of determining the number of discretionary deferred shares that may be 
granted.
For 2017 , the Remuneration Committee plans to measure Mr Gamkrelidze’s performance against KPIs which reflect the Group’s strategy 
and priorities. 
Healthcare 
• Meeting budget for revenue, EBITDA and net profit.
• Delivery of the two large hospital capex projects.
• Delivery of the strategy in respect of new products and services.
• Quality of care improvements.
• Outpatient rollout – significant progress towards 2018 target of 15% share of healthcare revenues of the Group.
• Development of IT strategy and first steps on implementation. 
Pharma
• Successful integration of the GPC and ABC acquisitions.
• Improved gross margins and EBITDA margins.
• Extraction of anticipated synergies.
• Progress on retention of pharma customers and expansion of loyalty platform.
Insurance
• Retention of claims within Evex.
• Improvement of combined ratio.
Group-wide
• Talent development and retention.
• Establishment and effective functioning of a new risk management function.
• Personal development of executive management including Mr Gamkrelidze himself.

1 Mr Gamkrelidze’s unvested and unexercised shares include all options granted in respect of the 2016 work year.
As at the date of this Report, Mr Gamkredlize’s vested and unvested shareholding remains 846,981 GHG shares, representing 
approximately 0.64% of the share capital of GHG. The vesting period for the majority of unvested shares exceeds three years. None of 
Mr Gamkrelidze’s connected persons have any interests in the shares of the Company.
The Policy is heavily weighted towards remuneration in deferred salary shares and discretionary compensation in deferred shares. The long 
vesting periods, particularly for deferred salary shares (five years), will result in future years in executive management having large holdings 
of unvested shares. Accordingly, the Group does not apply a shareholding guideline or impose a holding period on Mr Gamkrelidze’s or 
executive management’s shares. The Policy naturally results in our Mr Gamkrelidze and our executive management team holding a 
significant number of unvested shares and achieves a delay between performance and vesting. We believe these results are consistent 
with the principles of the Investment Management Association.
The Group does not require Non-Executive Directors to hold a specified number of shares in GHG. Notwithstanding this, some 
Non-Executive Directors have chosen to become shareholders. Save for Irakli Gilauri who sold 6,000 GHG shares earlier this year, there 
have been no other changes in the Non-Executive Directors’ GHG shareholdings since 31 December 2015. 
3.9 Details of Non-Executive Directors’ letters of appointment
The Company has entered into letters of appointment with each Non-Executive Director. The letters of appointment require Non-Executive 
Directors to provide one month’s notice prior to termination. The letters of appointment for all current Non-Executive are effective from 
4 September 2015 with each Non-Executive Director being put forward for election at each Annual General Meeting following his or her 
appointment. Continuation of a Non-Executive Director’s employment is conditional on his or her continued satisfactory performance and 
re-election by shareholders at each Annual General Meeting.
A succession plan adopted by the Board provides for a tenure of six years on both the GHG and JSC GHG boards. Upon the expiry of such 
six-year tenure, the appointment of the relevant Director will generally cease at the next upcoming Annual General Meeting.  106 
Georgia Healthcare Group PLC  Annual Report 2016  Governance
Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the Board determines that, in order to maintain the balance of appropriate skills and experience required 
for the Board, it is important to retain a Director on the Board beyond the relevant six-year period, the Board may offer the Director a letter 
of appointment for an additional one-year term. Such a one-year “re-appointment” may be renewed no more than two times, with the 
effect that the usual six-year tenure may be extended to a maximum of nine years if circumstances were to warrant such extension.
3.10 Consideration of shareholder views 
The Remuneration Committee considers shareholder feedback received on our remuneration structure each year as well as guidance from 
shareholder representative bodies, as we view shareholder input as key when shaping our remuneration policy. In 2015 and, 2016, we met 
with a number of our significant shareholders to discuss our remuneration structure and engaged directly with several shareholder advisory 
groups. The feedback we received was positive and our shareholders were widely supportive of our executive remuneration structure, 
understanding that although it varies from a typical UK remuneration structure in that we do not operate an LTIP or give cash bonuses. The 
absence of cash bonuses and the dominance of deferred share compensation in the overall remuneration package creates a direct and 
natural alignment of shareholder and executive management interests. 
3.11 Consideration of employment conditions elsewhere in the Group
When determining an Executive Director’s remuneration, the Remuneration Committee considers: (i) the pay and employment conditions of 
executive management (other than Directors) and executive management; (ii) any changes in pay and employment conditions across the 
Group as a whole; (iii) whether employees across the Group are personally satisfied with the way they are remunerated; and (iv) any 
feedback received during the year from the Human Resources department, executive management and other employees on the executive 
remuneration structure. In 2016, we also introduced a new share based compensation scheme for key doctors.
We frequently benchmark remuneration at all levels within the Group in order to ensure that our remuneration is competitive in order to 
attract the right candidates and remains competitive in order to motivate, satisfy and retain our talent. For a FTSE All-Share company of our 
size and depth, our Executive Directors must have the skills, experience, work ethic and attitude required to successfully execute our 
strategy, meet our objectives and create value for shareholders over the long term. In order to recruit and retain this talent, we must 
benchmark the value of remuneration against other FTSE companies of similar size and sector listed in the UK. Our Executives are not paid 
cash bonuses and therefore remuneration in the form of deferred shares will comprise by far the largest part of total remuneration. 
The compensation of employees in the Group, other than Executive Directors, is benchmarked against the Georgian labour market as this is 
the most relevant comparator. Our employees are offered competitive remuneration packages which include benefits and the opportunity to 
participate in the pension scheme on the same terms as applicable to Mr Gamkrelidze and executive management. Bonuses are usually 
paid in cash. The results of the 2016 survey conducted by the Human Resources department in respect of remuneration confirmed that 
employees are largely satisfied with their fixed compensation and bonus opportunity. 
4. Shareholding of executive management
The following table sets forth the respective GHG shares held by a few members of our executive management team as at 31 December 
2015 and 2016.

Giorgi Mindiashvili – – – – 145,000 145,000
As mentioned in the Chairman’s Statement, the structure of the Policy as it applies to Mr Gamkrelidze equally applies to executive 
management. Each member of executive management listed above receives a modest cash salary, salary shares that vests over five years 
and the potential to earn discretionary deferred shares that vest over a three-year period. 
The figures in the table above reflect deferred share salary and discretionary deferred shares granted in 2016 in respect of the 2015 work 
year. For each of Mr Gogia, Mr Vakhtangishvili and Mr Mindiashvili, deferred shares accounted for no less than 77 .5% of total remuneration 
in 2015, The predominance of deferred shares defines our remuneration structure. Like Mr Gamkrelidze, executive management is focused 
on long-term value creation.
5. Committee effectiveness review
Lintstock also performed the effectiveness review of the Committee. The evaluation principally addressed the composition of the 
Committee, the structure and effectiveness of the Remuneration Policy as well as the performance evaluation process. The effectiveness 
evaluation concluded that the Committee continues to operate and perform effectively. 
Our priorities for 2017 include:
• Integration of our pharma executive management into the structure of our Policy as it applies to executive management;
• Continued review of executive management performance against expanded self-development and mentoring KPIs; and
• Enhancement of the scope of management performance evaluations.

6. Directors’ Remuneration Policy
Our Directors’ Remuneration Policy was approved by our shareholders at the 2016 AGM. The approved Directors’ Remuneration Policy 
(which has not been amended) is valid for three years from the date of the 2016 AGM and will not be presented to shareholders for  
approval at the 2017 AGM. In the pages that follow, we have provided the Directors’ Remuneration Policy in order to provide context  
to the discussion of the implementation of the policy in the Directors’ Remuneration Report on pages 107 to 113. Please refer to the 2016 
Annual Report for the full text of the approved Directors’ Remuneration Policy, which is also available on our website,  
http://ghg.com.ge/annualreports. 
Information on how the policy will be implemented in 2017 is included on pages 113 and 115. There will be no significant changes between 
the Directors’ Remuneration Policy and its implementation in 2017 .
It is a provision of this Policy that the Group will honour all pre-existing obligations and commitments that were entered into prior to this 
Policy taking effect. The terms of those pre-existing obligations and commitments may differ from the terms of the Policy and may include 
(without limitation) obligations and commitments under service contracts, deferred share compensation schemes and pension and 
benefit plans.

Discretionary 
deferred share 
compensation
Annual performance-based 
compensation paid entirely in the 
form of nil-cost options over GHG 
shares which vest over a three-year 
period. As with the deferred share 
salary, this promotes the Group’s 
long-term success by closely aligning 
the Executive Director’s and 
shareholders’ interests. The Group 
pays no cash bonus to its Executive 
Directors and has no LTIP .
Awarded annually after the end  
of the work year in respect of which 
the award is made over a number of 
GHG shares that are determined 
annually by the Remuneration 
Committee, based on the 
performance of the Group and  
the achievement of the KPIs set  
for the Executive Director by the 
Remuneration Committee for the 
work year (see section 6.1(b) below).
Awards vest as to 33.33% in January 
of each of the second, third and 
fourth years following the work year.
At vesting (upon exercise of the 
nil-cost options), the Executive 
Director receives (in addition to the 
vested shares) cash payments equal 
to the dividends paid (if any) on the 
underlying shares between the date 
the award was made and the vesting

Unvested deferred share

other than for “good reason” or if the 
Director does not remain employed by 
the Group (each as defined in the 
relevant service contract, as is 
explained for Mr Gamkrelidze in 
section 6.4(b) below). The Board has, 
however, reserved the right to permit 
unvested discretionary deferred 
shares to vest irrespective of the 
Executive Director’s departure when 
such Executive Director departs on 
good terms with the Group.
If at any time after awarding 
discretionary deferred share 
compensation it has been 
determined that there was a material 
misstatement in the financial results 
for the financial year in respect of 
which the award was formally 
granted, the Board has the right to 
cause some or all of the award for 
that financial year or for any 
subsequent financial year that is 
unvested at the time of its 
determination, not to vest and 
to lapse.
Discretionary deferred share 
compensation is granted out of a 
pool of shares made available for 
such awards.
The Remuneration Committee 
reserves the right to award no 
discretionary deferred share 
compensation if the Group’s 
performance is unsatisfactory  
or if the Executive Director’s 
performance is poor in light of the 
KPIs set by the Remuneration 
Committee for the Executive 
Director.
For Mr Gamkrelidze, the maximum 
value of discretionary deferred share 
compensation that may be awarded 
in a given year for the remainder of 
his service contract with the Group is 
capped at 100% of total salary (see 
section 6.1(b) below).
Discretionary deferred share 
compensation for any newly 
appointed Executive Director, other 
than Mr Gamkrelidze, will not 
comprise more than 125% of the 
Executive Director’s total salary. 
However, the Remuneration 
Committee has reserved the right to 
increase the maximum discretionary 
deferred share compensation to 
150% of the Executive Director’s 
total salary for performance that has 
resulted in outstanding benefits for 
shareholders.

Purpose and link to strategy Operation Opportunity
Pension The provision of retirement benefits 
helps to attract and retain high-calibre 
talent.
The Group operates a defined 
contribution pension scheme. 
The Executive Director and the Group 
each contribute a minimum of 1% of 
the Executive Director’s gross 
monthly cash salary payable under 
his service contract with JSC GHG.
There is no provision for the recovery 
or withholding of pension payments.
The Group will match in additional 
contributions in a proportion of 0.2 to 
one, up to a maximum additional 
Group contribution of 1% of gross 
monthly salary where the Executive 
Director makes additional 
contributions up to 5% of gross 
monthly salary.
Benefits Non-cash benefits are in line with 
Georgian market practice and are 
designed to be sufficient to attract 
and retain high-calibre talent.
Benefits consist of health insurance, 
disability insurance, Directors’ and 
officers’ liability insurance and 
personal security arrangements (if 
requested by the Executive Director).
A tax equalisation payment may be 
paid to an Executive Director if any 
part of his remuneration becomes 
subject to double taxation.
There is no provision for the recovery 
or withholding of benefits.
There is no prescribed maximum on 
the value of benefits payable to an 
Executive Director.
If the Executive Director’s personal 
circumstances do not change and the 
Group is able to obtain benefits on 
substantially the same terms as at 
the date of the publication of this 
Policy, the aggregate cost of benefits 
for an Executive Director during the 
Policy’s life is not expected to change 
materially.
Notes:
1 Under service contracts with GHG and/or JSC GHG (as applicable).
2  GHG cash salary is converted from Dollar to GBP at the exchange rate published by the Bank of England on each monthly payment date. JSC GHG cash salary is 
converted from Dollar to Lari at the exchange rate published by the National Bank of Georgia on each monthly payment date.
3 Dividend equivalents (if any) are paid in Lari as at the date dividends were paid to other shareholders.
a) Deferred share salary
The deferred share salary comprises the most important element of the Executive Director’s fixed annual remuneration and is 
commensurate with his role within the Group. By heavily weighting base salary in favour of deferred share compensation rather than cash, 
Executive Director’s day-to-day actions are geared towards sustained Group performance over the long term. The deferred share salary 
component is neither a bonus nor LTIP , it is salary fixed at the outset of each service contract and is therefore not subject to performance 
targets or measures. The salary increases or declines in value depending on Group performance over the four years following the work year, 
aligning the Executive Director’s interests directly and naturally with those of the Group’s shareholders.
b) Discretionary deferred share compensation
The Group does not operate an LTIP because it believes there is sufficient long-term incentive built into its deferred share salary and 
discretionary deferred share compensation. No cash bonuses are paid to the Executive Director. Instead, individual and Group performance 
is rewarded through an award of discretionary deferred share compensation that vests over the three years following the work year. 
As discretionary deferred share compensation is awarded to reward past performance over the work year, it is not subject to any 
performance measures over the period from award to vesting. The aggregate pool of shares available each year for awards of discretionary 
deferred share compensation for the Executive Director and the Executive Management as a whole is determined annually by the 
Remuneration Committee in its absolute discretion, based on a number of factors including: 
• financial objectives; 
• strategic objectives; and
• people and similar softer objectives.
The number of shares over which the Executive Director’s discretionary deferred share compensation will be granted is determined by the 
Remuneration Committee by reference to the performance of the Group and the Executive Director’s KPIs. These KPIs are set for the 
Executive Director by the Remuneration Committee at the start of the financial year and reflect the Executive Director’s required 
contribution to the Group’s overall key strategic and financial objectives for that financial year. See section 3.2 above for a description of the 
KPIs set for Mr Gamkrelidze in respect of 2016 and his performance against these, as well as the KPIs which have been set for him in 
respect of 2017 .
Whilst the Remuneration Committee has defined the set of factors to be considered in determining the aggregate pool of discretionary 
deferred shares and evaluating an Executive Director’s performance, it seeks to steer away from defining a series of narrow objectives for 
Executive Management and does not employ strict weighting of performance measures. A high level of discretion is intentionally 
maintained when determining the quantum of discretionary deferred shares awarded to the Executive Director even in a “good” year for 
the Executive Director (e.g. achievement of most of his KPIs). In a “bad” year for the Group (e.g. poor financial performance by it), the 
Executive Director could receive little or no discretionary share compensation.  110 
Georgia Healthcare Group PLC  Annual Report 2016  Governance
As mentioned in the Policy table above, the maximum value of discretionary deferred share compensation that Mr Gamkrelidze may be 
awarded in a given year for the remainder of his service contract with the Group is capped at 100% of his total salary. For these purposes, 
total salary comprises the annual cash salary and the deferred salary shares provided for in Mr Gamkrelidze’s service contract, the latter 
being valued, for the current service contract, by reference to the share price as of the date of admission to the London Stock Exchange, 
and for future service contracts, by reference to the share price as of the date of the contract.
c) Equity compensation trust 
An equity compensation trust has been established for the purpose of satisfying deferred share salary and discretionary deferred share 
compensation in the form of nil-cost options awarded to any eligible executive. The trust was established in 2015. If GHG needs to issue 
new shares or repurchase shares, or a combination of both, in order to ensure that there is a sufficient number of shares committed to the 
trust in order to satisfy awards, the Group has committed to shareholders that new shares issued in satisfaction of deferred share 
compensation from the time of listing on the London Stock Exchange will not exceed 10% of GHG’s ordinary share capital over any 10-year 
period.
d) Comparison with the remuneration policies for employees generally
The components of the remuneration package for Executive Directors (as provided for by the Policy) are broadly the same as those for 
non-Board members of the Executive Management. Other members of executive management and middle management receive their 
entire salary in cash and do not receive deferred share salary. Their bonuses may be either in the form of cash and/or shares which vest 
over a three-year period following the award. All other employees within the Group receive a cash salary and may be eligible to receive cash 
bonuses, portions of which may be deferred until the publication of the audited annual results for the work year and/or based on continuous 
employment with the Group. The deferred portion of the cash bonus may also be reduced if it is revealed, upon completion of the annual 
audit, that the annual results published by the department where the employee works were incorrect in any material respect. All employees 
receive a competitive benefit package in line with Georgian market practice and are entitled to participate in the pension scheme on the 
same terms as applicable to Executive Directors.
e) Business expenses
Executive Directors are reimbursed for reasonable business expenses incurred in the course of carrying out duties under their service 
contract, on provision of valid receipts.
6.2 Elements of the Policy – Non-Executive Directors
In 2016, each member of the Board of GHG, with the exception of Mr Gamkrelidze, served as a member of the supervisory board of JSC 
GHG. Each member of the Board, with the exception of Mr Gilauri, received (in respect of their services to GHG) a base fee and was further 
remunerated for membership on the Audit, Remuneration, Nomination and Clinical Quality and Safety Committees, where applicable.
The Policy provides for a Non-Executive Director’s remuneration package to be comprised of the following elements:
Component Purpose and link to strategy Operation Opportunity
Base cash fee The fee for the GHG Board is 
competitive enough to attract and 
retain experienced individuals. The 
Senior Independent Non-Executive 
Director receives a higher base fee 
which reflects the extra time 
commitment and responsibility.
Cash payment on a quarterly basis. The amount of remuneration is 
reviewed every three years by the 
Remuneration Committee.
The Remuneration Committee 
reserves the right, in its sole 
discretion, to amend and vary the 
fees if there are genuinely 
unforeseen and exceptional 
circumstances which necessitate 
such review and in such 
circumstances any significant 
increase shall be the minimum 
reasonably required. The maximum 
aggregate GHG fees for all Non-
Executive Directors which may be 
paid under GHG’s Articles of 
Association is GBP 750,000.
Cash fee for each  
committee 
membership
Additional fee to compensate  
for additional time spent discharging 
committee duties.
Cash payment on a  
quarterly basis.
The amount of remuneration for 
committee membership is reviewed 
every three years by the 
Remuneration Committee.
Notes:
1  Non-Executive Directors did not receive any deferred share salary or discretionary deferred share compensation, pensions, benefits or any variable or performance-
linked remuneration or incentives in 2016.
2  Non-Executive Directors are reimbursed for reasonable business expenses, including travel expenses, incurred in the course of carrying out duties under their letters of 
appointment, on provision of valid receipts.
3  Non-Executive Directors who are appointed to the Board of the Company and/or to the supervisory board of JSC GHG by shareholders of the Company are required to 
waive any entitlements to fees which would otherwise be payable to them under the Policy for so long as they are appointees of a shareholder.

6.3 T otal remuneration opportunity for our sole Executive Director
The chart below shows the remuneration which Mr Gamkrelidze, the sole Executive Director, could receive in respect of 2017 under the 
Policy at three different performance levels. It should be noted that, at the maximum level, 80% of Mr Gamkrelidze’s 2017 compensation 
will be in the form of deferred shares for which the vesting period is either three or five years. At the minimum level, 62% of 
Mr Gamkrelidze’s 2017 compensation will be in the form of deferred shares for which the average vesting period is either three or five 
years.

Notes:
1  Salary is comprised of cash, deferred share salary, benefits and pension contributions. Mr Gamkrelidze’s total cash salary in 2017 in respect of both his service contract 
with GHG and JSC GHG will be US$225,000. Deferred share salary is calculated as described in Note 2 to table 3.1 . Deferred share salary in respect of 2017 will be 
formally granted in January 2018 and will vest from January 2019 to January 2022. For the purpose of this chart, tax equalisation for the calendar year has been added 
and the value of pension and non-tax equalisation benefits for 2016 has been used as it is assumed the value will be substantially the same in 2017 .
2   The means of determining the number of shares underlying the discretionary deferred share compensation and terms and conditions applying to this compensation are 
described in section 6.1(b). Discretionary deferred shares in respect of 2017 will be formally granted in January 2018 and will vest in January 2019, January 2020 and 
January 2021 .
3  Minimum opportunity reflects a scenario whereby Mr Gamkrelidze receives only fixed remuneration, comprised of cash salary, deferred share salary, benefits and 
pension contributions and the Remuneration Committee considers that the Group’s and/or the Director’s performance in 2017 does not warrant any award of 
discretionary deferred share compensation.
4  On target opportunity reflects a scenario whereby Mr Gamkrelidze receives fixed remuneration (as described above) and assumes a discretionary deferred share 
compensation award at 70% of the maximum opportunity for Group and individual performance which is in line with the Group’s expectation, which is excellent performance.
5  Maximum opportunity reflects a scenario whereby Mr Gamkrelidze receives fixed remuneration (as described above) and a discretionary deferred share compensation 
award of 100% of total salary (i.e. the Remuneration Committee considers that the Group’s and the individual’s performance in 2017 warrant the highest possible level 
of discretionary deferred share compensation).
6  The value of deferred shares does not take into account any increase or decrease in share price over the vesting period or dividend equivalents (if any) payable on 
vesting (upon exercise of the nil-cost options).
6.4 Payments for loss of office (audited)
From the date of listing up to the year end, no Executive Director left the Group and therefore no payments for loss of office were paid to, 
or receivable by, any Director.
Allan Hirst is the only non-Executive Director to have left the Group since the date of listing, Mr Hirst resigned effective 17 December 2016. 
He had given notice as per his Letter of Appointment and was paid pro-rata for the month of December.
The following paragraphs (a) and (b) describe the Group’s policy for payments on termination of Mr Gamkrelidze’s service contracts with 
GHG and JSC GHG. In 2016 and as at the date of this Annual Report, Mr Gamkrelidze is the sole Executive Director on the GHG Board. The 
Group’s policy on payments for loss of office for Non-Executive Directors and its approach to payments for loss of office for future Executive 
and Non-Executive Directors is described in paragraph 6.5 below. The Directors’ service contracts and letters of appointment are available 
for inspection by shareholders at the Company’s registered office.
(a) Termination of GHG PLC service contract dated 1 March 2016 (effective on admission)
Mr Gamkrelidze’s service contract with the Company is for an indefinite term (subject to annual re-election at the Annual General Meeting) 
and is terminable by either party on not less than four months’ written notice. Where the service contract is terminated on notice the 
Company may put Mr Gamkrelidze on garden leave for some or all of the notice period and continue to pay his cash salary under the 
Company service contract provided that any accrued and unused holiday entitlement shall be deemed to be taken during the garden 
leave period.
The Company may terminate Mr Gamkrelidze’s employment early with immediate effect and without notice and pay in lieu of notice in the 
case of, among other circumstances, his dishonesty, gross misconduct, conviction of an offence (other than traffic-related) or becoming of 
unsound mind.
The Company may also terminate the agreement with immediate effect by payment in lieu of notice, in which case the payment in lieu  
of notice shall be solely in respect of cash salary due under the Company’s service contract as at the date of termination of employment. 112 
Georgia Healthcare Group PLC  Annual Report 2016  Governance
(b) Termination of JSC GHG service agreement dated 29 April 2015
On 29 April 2015 the Group entered into a service contract with Mr Gamkrelidze. Neither party shall have the right to terminate the 
agreement prior to expiration of the employment term for any reason whatsoever, except for: 
(i)  termination by the Group for cause, which shall be on the basis of a written notice to the Chief Executive Officer and shall have 
immediate effect; 
(ii)  termination by the Group without cause, which shall be on the basis of a written notice to the Chief Executive Officer and shall have 
immediate effect; and
(iii)  termination by the Chief Executive Officer upon serving three months’ prior written notice. Unless otherwise agreed with the Board,  
the Chief Executive Officer will resign only upon expiration of this three-month notice period.
Separation payments
In the circumstances listed below where Mr Gamkrelidze’s service contract is terminated, he is entitled only to accrued and unpaid cash 
salary and accrued but not yet paid business expenses, a leaving allowance and severance payment constituting the immediate monetary 
equivalent of no less than six months’ base salary and any accrued but unpaid tranches of the cash bonus (if any) if termination is by the 
Company without cause. Mr Gamkrelidze is entitled to three months’ base salary and any accrued but unpaid tranches of the cash bonus (if 
any) in the case of termination by Mr Gamkrelidze for good reason.
The aforementioned circumstances are: 
• termination by the JSC GHG for “cause” (cause being defined as gross and wilful misconduct in the course of his duties having a 
material adverse effect on the Group, material repeated failure to perform his duties or breach of his obligations or conviction of a felony, 
among other circumstances);
• termination by reason of death or disability (in which case he receives life or disability insurance benefits); or
• termination by Mr Gamkrelidze other than for “good reason” (meaning uncorrected material breach of a material provision of the service 
contract by JSC GHG which is not cured within 30 days of Mr Gamkredlize serving notice of breach).
The Group may restrict Mr Gamkrelidze from being employed in the healthcare industry and/or providing consulting or similar services to a 
competing healthcare institution for a period of up to four months following the termination of his employment and will continue to pay him 
his full cash salary under the JSC GHG service contract as compensation for his unemployment during this period.
In addition, without the prior written consent of the Company, Mr Gamkrelidze shall not contact, deal with or solicit any customer or client 
of the Group with whom he has had any business dealings in the six months prior to the termination of his service contract, for the purpose 
of providing services similar to or in competition with those provided by the Company.
The garden leave and non-compete period does not in aggregate exceed six months.
Vesting and lapse of awards
If the agreement is terminated by the Company for cause, Mr Gamkrelidze terminates the agreement for any reason other than for good 
reason, upon the expiry of the agreement Mr Gamkrelidze does not accept a new service agreement upon substantially similar terms and/
or Mr Gamkrelidze does not remain or immediately become an executive of another Group company as defined in his service agreement, 
then unless otherwise resolved by the Board, any unvested awarded deferred cash salary and discretionary deferred share compensation 
as at the date when the Executive ceases to be an “executive” shall lapse.
If the agreement is terminated without cause, upon the expiry of the agreement Mr Gamkrelidze is not offered a new service agreement 
upon substantially similar terms or Mr Gamkrelidze ceases to be an “executive” by reason of injury, disability, redundancy or retirement (at 
normal retirement age), then any unvested awarded deferred share salary and discretionary deferred share compensation as at the date 
when the Executive ceases to be an “executive” shall continue to vest in the normal way during the respective vesting period(s). 
If before the end of the vesting period Mr Gamkrelidze ceases to be an “executive” by reason of death, Mr Gamkrelidze terminates the 
agreement for good reason or a change of control event occurs, then any unvested awarded deferred share salary and discretionary 
deferred share compensation shall vest immediately.
(c) Termination of Non-Executive Directors’ appointment
Each Non-Executive Director is required to submit himself or herself for annual re-election at the Annual General Meeting. The letters of 
appointment with GHG for each Non-Executive Director are effective from 4 September 2015. 
The letters of appointment provide for a one month notice period although the Group may terminate the appointment with immediate  
effect without notice or pay in lieu of notice if the Non-Executive Director has committed any serious breach or non-observance of his or  
her obligations to the Group, is guilty of fraud or dishonesty, brings the Group or him/herself into disrepute or is disqualified as acting as  
a Non-Executive Director, among other circumstances. Upon termination, the only remuneration a Non-Executive Director is entitled to  
is accrued fees as at the date of termination, together with reimbursement of properly incurred expenses incurred prior to the termination 
date.
6.5 Policy on the appointment of external hires and internal appointments
Any new Executive Director appointed to the Board would be paid no more than the Remuneration Committee considers reasonably 
necessary to attract a candidate with the relevant skills and experience. His or her remuneration package would comprise the components 
described in section 6.1 above. The Remuneration Committee may, in its discretion and taking into account the role assumed by the new 
Executive Director, vary the amount of any component in the package. This discretion will only be exercised to the extent required to 
facilitate the recruitment of the particular individual. In addition, the terms and conditions attaching to any component of the remuneration 
might be varied insofar as the Remuneration Committee considers it necessary or desirable to do so in all the circumstances.

Relocation support for an incoming Executive Director and, where relevant, his or her family, may be provided depending on the individual’s 
circumstances. The Group has not set a maximum aggregate amount that may be paid in respect of any individual’s relocation support, but 
it will aim to provide support of an appropriate level and quality on the best terms that can reasonably be obtained.
Upon the recommendation of the Remuneration Committee, the Group may “buy out” incentive awards which were granted to an 
incoming Executive Director by a previous employer and which have been foregone. In these circumstances, the approach will be to match 
the estimated current value of the foregone awards by granting awards of deferred share compensation which vest over a similar period to 
the awards being bought out. The application of performance conditions and/or clawback provisions may also be considered, where 
appropriate. Such new awards may be granted in addition to any deferred share salary and discretionary deferred share compensation. Any 
payment upon termination of a new Executive Director’s service contract would not exceed 12 months’ cash salary under the relevant 
service contract, plus any accrued and unpaid cash salary, benefits and holiday pay and reimbursement of any business expenses. The 
Group may also continue to pay a former Executive Director his full cash salary for any period following the termination of his appointment 
during which he is prohibited from competing with the Group.
It is expected that the following vesting provisions will apply to deferred share compensation in the case of termination of a new Executive 
Director’s service contract: 
• Unvested deferred share compensation would lapse upon termination of the service contract by the Company or JSC GHG for cause, 
termination by the Executive Director other than for good reason or if the Executive Director’s employment is terminated for any other 
reason and he/she is not offered continued membership of the GHG Board or JSC GHG’s supervisory board. 
• Unvested deferred share compensation would continue to vest in the normal way during the respective vesting period(s) upon 
termination by the Company or JSC GHG without cause, if the Executive Director’s service contract expires and he/she is not offered a 
new service contract on substantially similar terms on expiration or if the Executive Director ceases to be an Executive Director by 
reason of injury, disability, redundancy or retirement (at normal retirement age). 
• Unvested deferred share compensation would vest immediately upon death of the Executive Director, termination of the service 
contract by the Executive Director for good reason or a change of control. 
Notwithstanding the above, the Board reserves the right to permit unvested deferred share compensation to vest irrespective of the 
Executive Director’s departure when such Executive Director departs on good terms with the Group.
Any new Non-Executive Director appointed to the Board would be paid no more than the Remuneration Committee considers reasonably 
necessary in light of market practice among other FTSE All Shares Index companies and the current remuneration of other Non-Executive 
Directors. His or her remuneration package would comprise the same components as the existing Non-Executive Directors. 
If an existing employee of the Group is appointed as an Executive or Non-Executive Director, any obligation or commitment entered into 
with that individual prior to his/her appointment will be honoured by the Group in accordance with the terms of those obligations or 
commitments, even where they differ from the terms of the Policy.
6.6 Consideration of shareholder views and employment conditions elsewhere in the Group
In accordance with the statement in this section of the Annual Report 2015, the Remuneration Committee has taken into account 
shareholders views after the Annual General Meeting held on 26 May 2016 – please see sections 3.10 and 3.11 above.

Deferral terms Awarded annually after the end of the work year in respect of which 
the award is made over a number of GHG shares to be determined 
by the Remuneration Committee, based on the performance of the 
Group and the achievement of the KPIs set for the Executive 
Director by the Remuneration Committee for the work year. Awards 
vest as to 33.33% in January of each of 2019, 2020 and 2021 . 
At vesting (upon exercise of the nil-cost options), Nikoloz 
Gamkrelidze receives (in addition to the vested shares) cash 
payments equal to the dividends paid (if any) on the underlying 
shares between the date the award was made and the vesting date.
Performance measures and targets For 2017 , the Remuneration Committee has determined that the 
performance measures for 2017 will be based on the following KPIs. 
Healthcare
• Meeting budget for revenue, EBITDA and net profit.
• Delivery of the two large hospital capex projects.
• Delivery of the strategy in respect of new products and services. 
• Quality of care improvements.
• Outpatient rollout – significant progress towards 2018 target of 
15% share of healthcare revenues of the Group.
• Development of IT strategy and first steps on implementation.
Pharma
• Successful integration of the GPC and ABC acquisitions.
• Improved gross margins and EBITDA margins.
• Extraction of anticipated synergies.
• Progress on retention of pharma customers and expansion  
of loyalty platform.
Insurance
• Retention of claims within Evex.
• Improvement of combined ratio.
Group-wide
• Talent development and retention.
• Establishment and effective functioning of a new risk 
management function.
• Personal development of executive management including 
Mr Gamkrelidze himself.
Due to the potential impact on our commercial interests, annual bonus weightings and targets are considered commercially sensitive and 
will therefore be disclosed in the 2017 remuneration report following the completion of the financial year.
There are circumstances in which unvested compensation may lapse and narrow circumstances in which it may vest immediately, all as set 
out in the Policy.
If at any time after awarding discretionary deferred share compensation it has been determined that there was a material misstatement in 
the financial results for the financial year in respect of which the award was formally granted, the Board has the right to cause some or all of 
the award for that financial year or for any subsequent financial year that is unvested at the time of its determination, not to vest and to 
lapse, as set out in the Policy.

Statement of Directors’ Responsibilities
The Directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report and 
the consolidated and stand-alone financial statements in 
accordance with applicable law and regulations. 
Company law requires us to prepare financial statements for each 
financial year. As required, we have prepared the accompanying 
consolidated and separate statements in accordance with 
International Financial Reporting Standards (“IFRS”) as adopted by 
the European Union and applicable law.
We must not approve the accompanying consolidated and 
stand-alone financial statements unless we are satisfied that they 
give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the Group and the 
Company and of the profit or loss of the Group and the Company 
for that period.
In preparing the accompanying consolidated and separate financial 
statements, we are required to:
• select suitable accounting policies and then apply them 
consistently;
• make judgements and estimates that are reasonable  
and prudent; 
• state whether they have been prepared in accordance with  
IFRS as adopted by the European Union, subject to any  
material departures disclosed and explained in the financial 
statements; and 
• prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis 
unless it is inappropriate to presume that the Company will 
continue in business.
We are also responsible for keeping adequate accounting records 
that are sufficient to show and explain the Company’s and the 
Group’s transactions, to disclose with reasonable accuracy at any 
time the financial position of the Company and the Group, and to 
enable us to ensure that the consolidated and separate financial 
statements and the Directors’ Remuneration Report comply with 
the Companies Act 2006 and, as regards the consolidated and 
stand-alone financial statements, Article 4 of the IAS Regulation.
We have further responsibility for safeguarding the assets of the 
Company and the Group and for taking reasonable steps for the 
prevention and detection of fraud and other irregularities.
We are also responsible for the maintenance and integrity of the 
Company’s website. Legislation in the UK governing the preparation

Statement of Directors’ responsibilities 
We confirm that to the best of our knowledge:
• the consolidated and stand-alone financial statements, prepared 
in accordance with IFRS as adopted by the European Union, give 
a true and fair view of the assets, liabilities, financial position and 
profit or loss of the Company and the Group taken as a whole; 
and
• the Strategic Report and the Directors’ Report contained in this 
Annual Report includes a fair review of the development and 
performance of the business and the position of the Company 
and the Group, together with a description of the principal risks 
and uncertainties that it faces.
In arriving at this position the Board was assisted by a number of 
processes that form part of its internal control and risk 
management systems, including the following:
• the Annual Report is drafted by appropriate senior management 
with overall coordination by the Head of Investor Relations to 
ensure consistency across sections;
• an extensive verification process is undertaken to ensure factual 
accuracy;
• comprehensive reviews of drafts of the Annual Report are 
undertaken by the Chief Executive Officer and other senior 
executive management;
• an advanced draft is considered and reviewed by GHG’s legal 
advisors; and
• the final draft is reviewed by the Audit Committee prior to 
consideration by the Board.
We consider that the Annual Report and Accounts, taken as a 
whole, is fair, balanced and understandable and gives shareholders 
the information needed to assess the Group’s position and 
performance, business model and strategy.

Articles of Association
GHG’s Articles of Association may only be amended by a special 
resolution at a general meeting of shareholders. The process for the 
appointment and removal of Directors is included in our Articles of 
Association. The GHG Articles of Association are available on GHG’s 
website: http://ghg.com.ge/uploads/pages/ghgarticles69-66.pdf.
Share capital and rights attaching to the shares
Details of the movements in share capital during the year are 
provided in Note 24 to the consolidated financial statements on 
page 167 of this Annual Report.
As at the date of this Annual Report, there was a single class of 
131,681,820 ordinary shares of one pence each in issue, each with 
one vote. The rights and obligations attaching to GHG’s ordinary 
shares are set out in its Articles of Association. Holders of ordinary 
shares are entitled, subject to any applicable law and GHG’s Articles 
of Association, to:
• have shareholder documents made available to them including 
the notice of any general meeting;
• attend, speak and exercise voting rights at general meetings, 
either in person or by proxy; and
• participate in any distribution of income or capital.
GHG is permitted to make market purchases of its own shares 
provided it is duly authorised by its members in a general meeting 
and subject to and in accordance with section 701 of the 
Companies Act 2006. Such authority was given at the 2016 AGM 
but no purchases were made during this financial year.
At the 2016 AGM, the Directors were given the power to (a) allot 
shares up to a maximum nominal amount of GBP 438,939, 
representing approximately a third of the Company’s issued share 
capital as at 31 March 2017 , and (b) to allot equity securities up to 
an aggregate nominal amount of GBP 877 ,878, in connection with 
an offer by way of a rights issue: (i) to holders of shares in 
proportion (as nearly as may be practicable) to their existing 
holdings; and (ii) to holders of other equity securities as required by 
the rights of those securities or, if the Directors consider it 
necessary, as permitted by the rights of those securities, such 
amount to be reduced by the aggregate nominal amount of shares 
allotted or rights to subscribe for or to convert any securities into 
shares granted under paragraph (a), and subject to the Directors 
having the right to make such exclusions or other arrangements as 
they may deem necessary or expedient in relation to treasury 
shares, fractional entitlements, record dates or legal, regulatory or 
practical problems in, or under the laws of, any territory. These 
authorities will expire at the conclusion of the 2017 AGM and 
approval will be sought at that meeting to renew a similar authority 
for a further year. 
None of the ordinary shares carry any special rights with regard to 
control of GHG. 
There are no restrictions on transfers of shares other than:
• certain restrictions which may from time to time be imposed  
by laws or regulations such as those relating to insider dealing;
• pursuant to the Group Share Dealing Code, whereby the 
Directors and designated employees require approval to deal in 
GHG’s shares; and
• where a person with an interest in GHG’s shares has been 
served with a disclosure notice and has failed to provide GHG 
with information concerning interests in those shares.
All employees (including Directors) that are deemed by GHG  
to be insiders have complied with the Group’s Securities Dealing  
Code. There are no restrictions on exercising voting rights save  
in situations where GHG is legally entitled to impose such a  
restriction (for example, under the Articles of Association where 
amounts remain unpaid in the shares after request, or the holder  
is otherwise in default of an obligation to GHG). GHG is not aware 
of any arrangements between shareholders that may result in 
restrictions on the transfer of securities or voting rights. 118 
Georgia Healthcare Group PLC  Annual Report 2016  Governance
Results and dividends
The Group made a profit before taxation of GEL 40.2 million (year 
ended 31 December 2015: GEL 23.6 million). The Group’s profit 
after taxation for the year was GEL 61 .3 million (year ended 
31 December 2015: GEL 23.6 million). The normalised net profit for 
2016 was GEL 39.6 million: for further explanation please refer to 
the overview of financial results on pages 72 to 80.
GHG may by ordinary resolution declare dividends provided that  
no such dividend shall exceed the amount recommended by GHG’s 
Directors. The Directors may also pay interim dividends as appear  
to be justified by the profits of GHG available for distribution. 
As GHG is a holding company, GHG relies primarily on dividends 
and other statutorily (if any) and contractually permissible payments 
from its subsidiaries to generate the funds necessary to meet its 
obligations and pay dividend to its shareholders. 
GHG stated in its listing prospectus that it does not intend to pay 
dividends for the first two years following the admission of shares 
to listing.
Powers of Directors
The Directors may exercise all powers of GHG subject to applicable 
legislation and regulations and GHG’s Articles of Association.
Conflicts of interest
In accordance with the Companies Act 2006, the Directors have 
adopted a policy and procedure for the disclosure and authorisation 
(if appropriate) of conflicts of interest, and these have been 
followed during 2016. GHG’s Articles of Association also contain 
provisions to allow the Directors to authorise potential conflicts  
of interest so that a Director is not in breach of his duty under 
company law.
Directors’ remuneration
Directors’ fees are determined by the Board from time to time.  
The remuneration of our Directors’ must be in accordance with the 
Directors’ Remuneration Policy approved by our shareholders in 
2016. The fees paid to the Non-Executive Directors in 2016 pursuant 
to their letters of appointment are shown on page 104. The fees 
paid to our sole Executive Director in 2016 pursuant to his service 
agreements with GHG are shown on pages 101 to 103. 
Directors’ interests
The Directors’ beneficial interests in ordinary shares of GHG as at 
31 December 2016 are shown on page 105.
Indemnity
Subject to applicable legislation, every current and former Director 
or other officer of GHG (other than any person engaged by the 
Company as auditor) shall be indemnified by GHG against any 
liability in relation to GHG, other than (broadly) any liability to GHG 
or a member of the Group, or any criminal or regulatory fine.
Related party disclosures
Details of related party disclosures are set out in Note 41 to the 
consolidated financial statements on page 182 of this Annual Report.
Significant agreements – change of control
On 23 October 2015, GHG entered into a Relationship Agreement 
with BGEO and JSC BGEO Investments which regulates the 
degree of control that BGEO and its associates may exercise over 
the management and business of the Group. The principal purpose 
of the Relationship Agreement is to ensure that GHG and its 
subsidiaries are capable at all times of carrying on their business 
independently of BGEO and its associates. The Relationship 
Agreement took effect on 12 November 2015 and will continue until 
the earlier of: (i) GHG shares ceasing to be admitted to listing on 
the Official List; and (ii) BGEO, together with its associates, ceasing 
to own or control (directly or indirectly) 20% or more of the voting 
share capital of GHG. If BGEO ceases to be a controlling 
shareholder (within the meaning of LR 6.1 .2A of the Listing Rules), 
it may terminate the Relationship Agreement by giving one month’s 
written notice to GHG.
Under the Relationship Agreement, for so long as BGEO and its 
associates together hold 20% or more of the voting share capital  
of GHG, BGEO and its associates shall amongst other things:
• conduct all transactions, agreements or arrangements entered 
into between: (i) BGEO and its associates, and (ii) GHG or any  
of its subsidiaries on an arm’s length basis and on normal 
commercial terms and in accordance with the related party 
transaction rules set out in the Listing Rules;
• not take any action that has or would have the effect of 
preventing GHG or any of its subsidiaries from complying with 
their obligations under the Listing Rules;
• not propose or procure the proposal of any resolution of the 
shareholders (or any class thereof) which is intended, or appears 
to be intended, to circumvent the proper application of the 
Listing Rules; and/or
• abstain from voting on any resolution required by LR 11 .1 .7R(3) 
of the Listing Rules to approve a transaction with a related party 
involving BGEO.
The Relationship Agreement entitles BGEO to appoint one person 
to be a Non-Executive Director of GHG for so long as it (together 
with its associates) holds at least 20% of the voting share capital  
of GHG.
The Relationship Agreement also provides that (subject to 
permitted exceptions) neither BGEO nor its associates shall 
compete with the business of GHG nor use any names associated 
with GHG and that GHG shall not use any names associated with 
BGEO or its associates.
A copy of the Relationship Agreement is available to view at the 
Company’s registered office. 
At no time during 2016 did any Director hold a material interest  
in any contracts of significance with GHG or any subsidiary of the 
Group. The Company is not party to any significant agreements 
(apart from the Relationship Agreement) that would take effect, 
alter or terminate following a change of control of the Company. 
There are no agreements between the Company and any Director 
or employee that would provide compensation for loss of office  
or loss of employment that occurs because of a takeover bid. 
However, under the plans and provisions of the Company’s share 
schemes (including for deferred share salary and discretionary 
share compensation) and certain service agreements entered into 
between the Company and the Executives (as described in further 
detail in the Directors’ Remuneration Report) and between the 
Company and certain senior managers, certain awards granted 
to the Executive and senior management will vest on a takeover  
or other change of control.

Our assessment of risk of material misstatement
We identified the risks of material misstatement described below as those that had the greatest effect on our overall audit strategy,  
the allocation of resources in the audit and the direction of the efforts of the audit team. In addressing these risks, we have performed  
the procedures below which were designed in the context of the financial statements as a whole and, consequently, we do not express  
any opinion on this individual area.
Risk Our response to the risk Key observations communicated to the Audit Committee
Risk of fraud in recognition of healthcare  
and pharmaceutical revenue and gross 
premium written.
Revenue GEL 423.8 million,  
(2015: GEL 242.4 million).
The Group is the largest healthcare provider  
in Georgia and has grown rapidly through a 
series of acquisitions. The Group’s 
management may be under pressure to  
report strong financial performance in order  
to meet the expectations of internal and 
external stakeholders, including those arising 
from the IPO in 2015.
Compensation tied to the performance of  
the Group may create an incentive for 
management to manipulate results.
 
The acquisition of GPC during the year 
exposed the Group to new streams of 
revenue, including retail sales of 
pharmaceutical products, a customer  
loyalty programme and exchange  
transactions with other pharmaceutical 
companies. Judgment is required to be 
exercised by management in determining 
amounts recorded as revenue in respect of 
loyalty schemes and exchange transactions.
As a consequence, there is a greater risk  
of misstatement in these balances, either  
by fraud or error, including through the 
potential override of controls by  
management.
Refer to the Audit Committee Report  
(page 93); Accounting policies (page 143); and 
Notes 25, 26 and 27 of the Consolidated 
Financial Statements (pages 168 to 169).
• We obtained an understanding of the 
healthcare and pharmaceutical revenue  
and gross premiums written processes  
and assessed the design and operating 
effectiveness of key controls.
• We performed substantive testing of 
healthcare and pharmaceutical revenue  
and gross premium written including key 
items testing, representative sampling, 
testing manual and topside adjustments 
and cut-off testing (by selecting a sample 
of transactions either side of year-end).
• We performed procedures on contractual 
documentation for the sampled 
transactions to determine whether revenue 
had been recognised in accordance with 
the Group’s accounting policies and IFRS, 
particularly in respect of pharmaceutical 
exchange transactions and the issuing and 
redemption of points under customer 
loyalty programmes.
• We performed analytical procedures for 
healthcare and pharmaceutical revenue at 
legal entity level to consider unusual trends 
that could indicate material misstatements, 
including monthly fluctuations analysis and 
analysis of changes in key drivers of 
healthcare revenue, such as bed 
occupancy, number of patients and  
number of beds.
• We performed journal entry testing in  
order to identify and test the risk of 
misstatement arising from management 
override of controls.
• For insurance premiums, we recalculated 
the unearned premium reserve and related 
income statement accounts, and 
performed analytical reviews, including 
ratio analysis, trend analysis and prediction 
analysis.
• We considered whether the presentation 
and disclosure of revenue in the financial 
statements is in accordance with relevant 
accounting standards.
Based on the results of our audit procedures, 
we concluded that the healthcare and 
pharmaceutical revenue and gross premium 
written for the year ended 31 December 2016 
has been recognised in accordance with IFRS. 
In particular, exchange transactions and 
customer loyalty schemes have been 
accounted for in accordance with IAS18  
and IFRIC13 respectively. 122 
Georgia Healthcare Group PLC  Annual Report 2016  Financial statements
Independent Auditor’s Report continued
Our assessment of risk of material misstatement (continued)
Risk Our response to the risk Key observations communicated to the Audit Committee
Accounting and financial reporting  
of business combinations.
Total assets of acquired subsidiaries  
GEL 80.0 million (2015: GEL 139.9 million).
In 2016 the Group acquired GPC and a  
number of other subsidiaries, and finalised  
the acquisition accounting for certain entities 
acquired in 2015, including LLC Deka and 
GNCo. It also obtained de-facto control over 
JSC Poti Central Clinical Hospital and LLC 
Emergency service. Full details of these 
acquisitions are set out in Note 5.
There is a risk of error in the reporting for  
such acquisitions, particularly in identifying 
and valuing the assets acquired,  
consideration paid and non-controlling 
interest. The risk is increased in the areas 
requiring management judgment, which 
include the identification and valuation of 
intangible assets and the valuation of 
inventory and property and equipment. 
Judgment is also required in determining 
whether de-facto control has been obtained 
over businesses where legal ownership  
has not transferred to the Group.
In addition, there is a risk of incomplete  
or inaccurate disclosures relating to  
the transactions.
Refer to the Audit Committee Report  
(page 94); Accounting policies (page 137); and 
Note 5 of the Consolidated Financial 
Statements (page 149).
• We tested the methodology and 
assumptions behind the significant 
judgements involved in the determination 
of the fair values of the identifiable net 
assets acquired, consideration and  
non-controlling interest. In particular  
we used our real estate valuation 
specialists to assess whether the  
valuation of acquired hospital land  
and buildings was within a reasonable 
range of possible valuations.
• By comparison to the requirements of  
IFRS and analysis of similar transactions  
in other markets, we challenged 
management as to whether they had 
properly identified intangible assets  
arising from the acquisition of GPC.
• We tested on a sample basis the existence 
of acquired subsidiaries’ assets and 
liabilities, including obtaining evidence of 
legal title to land and buildings.
• We performed procedures to test that 
management had identified and fair valued 
liabilities and contingent liabilities at the 
dates of acquisition.
• We obtained and tested the factual 
evidence of the Group obtaining de-facto 
control over JSC Poti Central Clinical 
Hospital and LLC Emergency service.
• We checked the accuracy and 
completeness of the disclosures on 
business combinations, including those 
completed after the balance sheet date.
Based on the results of our audit procedures, 
we concluded that the accounting for GPC 
and other subsidiaries acquired in 2016 and 
the finalisation of acquisition accounting for 
entities acquired in 2015 was materially 
correct.
We reported that we were satisfied that  
there are no material separately identifiable 
intangibles, arising from the GPC acquisition 
requiring recognition. 
Goodwill impairment testing.
Balance of GEL 54.7 million  
(2015: GEL 20.7 million).
The Group carries a significant amount of 
goodwill on the balance sheet as a result  
of a number of acquisitions in 2016 and 
previous years.
Under IFRS, the Group is required to test the 
amount of goodwill for impairment at least 
annually. The impairment tests were areas  
of our audit focus due to the complexity of  
the methodologies and need for management 
to make subjective judgments as to future 
market and economic developments and the 
performance of the business.
Refer to the Audit Committee Report  
(page 94); Accounting policies (page 138); and 
Note 12 of the Consolidated Financial 
Statements (pages 162).
• We validated that the cash flow  
projections included in the annual  
goodwill impairment tests were  
consistent with the Group’s business 
plans.
• We critically assessed and tested the 
methodologies, judgments and 
assumptions involved in the impairment 
test, including external market growth 
expectations and discount rates, by 
comparing them to external and historical 
data and by analysing sensitivities in the 
Group’s valuation model.
• We included valuation experts in our team 
to assist with these procedures. We 
specifically focused on the sensitivity in 
the available headroom for the cash 
generating units, evaluating whether a 
reasonably possible change in assumptions 
could cause the carrying amount to exceed 
its recoverable amount, and assessed the 
historical accuracy of management’s 
estimates.
• We also assessed the adequacy of the 
disclosures (Note 12) in the financial 
statements.
We consider management’s key assumptions 
used in the goodwill impairment test to be 
within a reasonable range.
 
We concluded that the recoverable amount of 
goodwill exceeds its carrying amount and that 
there is no impairment requiring recognition. 123

Risk Our response to the risk Key observations communicated to the Audit Committee
Valuation of hospitals and clinics  
and land and office buildings.
Balance of GEL 409.4 million,  
(2015: GEL 3.4 million).
As set out in Note 11, during 2016 the Group 
adopted the revaluation model for the 
measurement of its hospitals and clinics.
The Group appointed independent external 
valuers to perform a valuation of its land and 
office buildings, hospitals and clinics as at 
1 July 2016.
Real estate valuations are inherently  
uncertain and subject to an estimation 
process. Furthermore, the Group’s real  
estate properties are located primarily in 
Georgia, where the secondary market is 
relatively illiquid. Although the valuations  
are performed by external, appropriately 
qualified valuers there remains a risk  
that individual assets might be  
inappropriately valued.
Refer to the Audit Committee Report  
(page 94); Accounting policies (page 140);  
and Note 11 of the Consolidated Financial 
Statements (page 161).
We engaged our Real Estate specialists  
to evaluate the appropriateness of the  
Group’s valuation of land and office buildings, 
hospitals and clinics, including the following:
• we evaluated the competence, 
professional qualifications and objectivity of 
the external valuers engaged by the Group;
• through reading the valuation reports and 
discussion with management and the 
valuers, we obtained an understanding of 
the objectives and scope of the valuers’ 
work, the methods and assumptions that 
they had used and the conclusions that 
they had reached;
• we challenged the methods and 
assumptions used in the valuation reports, 
including consideration as to whether there 
was contrary market intelligence that had 
not been taken into account in the valuers’ 
analyses; and
• we assessed the data, application of the 
methods and logic and reasoning applied 
by the valuers. To the extent possible we 
compared this information to norms and 
benchmarks in the Georgian market, 
although we noted that there is limited

The scope of our audit
T ailoring the scope
Our assessment of audit risk, our evaluation of materiality and our allocation of performance materiality determine our audit scope for each 
entity within the Group. Taken together, this enables us to form an opinion on the consolidated financial statements. We take into account 
size, risk profile, the organisation of the Group and effectiveness of Group-wide controls, changes in the business environment and other 
factors such as recent Internal Audit results when assessing the level of work to be performed at each entity.
In assessing the risk of material misstatement to the Group financial statements, and to ensure we had adequate quantitative coverage of 
significant accounts in the financial statements, we selected components covering entities within the UK and Georgia, which represent the 
principal business units within the Group.

components but will have contributed to the coverage of significant accounts (and in particular revenue) tested for the Group.
3 We performed other procedures, including analytical review, testing of consolidation journals and intercompany eliminations to respond to any potential risks of material 
misstatement to the Group financial statements. 124

The scope of our audit (continued)
Involvement with component teams 
In establishing our overall approach to the Group audit, we determined the type of work that needed to be undertaken at each of the 
components by us, as the primary audit engagement team, or by component auditors from other EY global network firms operating under 
our instruction. For all four full scope components, audit procedures were performed directly by the primary audit team. For the two specific 
scope components, where the work was performed by component auditors, we determined the appropriate level of involvement to enable 
us to determine that sufficient audit evidence had been obtained as a basis for our opinion on the Group as a whole.
The Group audit team continued to follow a programme of planned visits that has been designed to ensure that the Senior Statutory Auditor 
visits the principal components of the Group. The Senior Statutory Auditor is based in the UK, but since Group management and operations 
reside in Georgia, the Group audit team operates as an integrated primary team including members from the UK, Georgia and Russia. 
During the current year’s audit cycle, visits were undertaken by the primary audit team to the component teams in Georgia. The Senior 
Statutory Auditor visited Georgia four times during the current year’s audit and there was regular interaction between team members in 
each jurisdiction. 
These visits involved discussing the audit approach with the Georgian primary team and the component teams and any issues arising from 
their work, as well as meeting with Group and local management. In addition, both London and Georgia based members of the primary 
team participated in planning and closing meetings and reviewed selected audit working papers. The primary team interacted regularly with 
the component teams where appropriate during various stages of the audit, reviewed key working papers and were responsible for the 
scope and direction of the audit process. This, together with the additional procedures performed at Group level, gave us appropriate 
evidence for our opinion on the Group financial statements.
Our application of materiality
We apply the concept of materiality in planning and performing the audit, in evaluating the effect of identified misstatements on the audit 
and in forming our audit opinion. 
 
Materiality
The magnitude of an omission or misstatement that, individually or in the aggregate, could reasonably be expected to influence the 
economic decisions of the users of the financial statements. Materiality provides a basis for determining the nature and extent of our  
audit procedures.
We determined materiality for the Group to be GEL 2.0 million (2015: GEL 1 .2 million), which is 5% (2015: 5%) of profit before tax. We 
consider that this profit figure best represents the results of the operations of the Group and as such provides us with an appropriate basis 
for determining the nature, timing and extent of risk assessment procedures, identifying and assessing the risk of material misstatement 
and determining the nature, timing and extent of further audit procedures.
 
During the course of our audit, we reassessed initial materiality and made adjustments based on the final financial performance of  
the Group.
Performance materiality
The application of materiality at the individual account or balance level. It is set at an amount to reduce to an appropriately low level the 
probability that the aggregate of uncorrected and undetected misstatements exceeds materiality.
On the basis of our risk assessments, together with our assessment of the Group’s overall control environment, our judgement was that 
performance materiality was 50% (2015: 50%) of our planning materiality, namely GEL 1 .0 million (2015: GEL 0.6 million). 
Audit work at component locations for the purpose of obtaining audit coverage over significant financial statement accounts is undertaken 
based on a percentage of total performance materiality. The performance materiality set for each component is based on the relative scale 
and risk of the component to the Group as a whole and our assessment of the risk of misstatement at that component. In the current year, 
the performance materiality allocated to components was GEL 0.4 million for full scope components and a range of GEL 0.2 million–0.5 
million for specific scope components. 125

Reporting threshold
An amount below which identified misstatements are considered to be clearly trivial.
We agreed with the Audit Committee that we would report to them all uncorrected audit differences in excess of GEL 0.1 million (2015: 
GEL 0.06 million), which is set at 5% (2015: 5%) of planning materiality, as well as differences below that threshold that, in our view, 
warranted reporting on qualitative grounds.
 
We evaluate any uncorrected misstatements against both the quantitative measures of materiality discussed above and in light of other 
relevant qualitative considerations in forming our opinion.
Scope of the audit of the financial statements
An audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements sufficient to give reasonable assurance 
that the financial statements are free from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or error. This includes an assessment of: 
whether the accounting policies are appropriate to the Group’s and the parent company’s circumstances and have been consistently applied 
and adequately disclosed; the reasonableness of significant accounting estimates made by the Directors; and the overall presentation of 
the financial statements. In addition, we read all the financial and non-financial information in the Annual Report 2016 to identify material 
inconsistencies with the audited financial statements and to identify any information that is apparently materially incorrect based on, or 
materially inconsistent with, the knowledge acquired by us in the course of performing the audit. If we become aware of any apparent 
material misstatements or inconsistencies, we consider the implications for our report.
Respective responsibilities of directors and auditor
As explained more fully in the Directors’ Responsibilities Statement set out on page 116, the Directors are responsible for the preparation of 
the financial statements and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view. Our responsibility is to audit and express an opinion on 
the financial statements in accordance with applicable law and International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland). Those standards require 
us to comply with the Auditing Practices Board’s Ethical Standards for Auditors.
This report is made solely to the Company’s members, as a body, in accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies Act 2006. Our 
audit work has been undertaken so that we might state to the Company’s members those matters we are required to state to them in an 
auditor’s report and for no other purpose. To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility to anyone other 
than the Company and the Company’s members as a body, for our audit work, for this report, or for the opinions we have formed.
 
Opinion on other matters prescribed by the Companies Act 2006
In our opinion:
• the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited has been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 2006; 
and
• based on the work undertaken in the course of the audit: 
 – the information given in the Strategic Report and the Directors’ Report for the financial year for which the financial statements are 
prepared is consistent with the financial statements; and
 – the Strategic Report and the Directors’ Report have been prepared in accordance with applicable legal requirements. 126

necessary for shareholders to assess the 
entity’s performance, business model and 
strategy; and whether the Annual Report 
appropriately addresses those matters that we 
communicated to the Audit Committee that 
we consider should have been disclosed.
We have no exceptions to report.

of the Company and its environment  
obtained in the course of the audit, we

in our opinion:
• adequate accounting records have not 
been kept by the parent company, or 
returns adequate for our audit have not 
been received from branches not visited  
by us; or
• the parent company financial statements 
and the part of the Directors’ 
Remuneration Report to be audited are not 
in agreement with the accounting records 
and returns; or
• certain disclosures of Directors’ 
remuneration specified by law are not 
made; or
• we have not received all the information 
and explanations we require for our audit.
We have no exceptions to report.
Listing Rules review requirements We are required to review:

ISAs (UK and Ireland) reporting We are required to give a statement as to 
whether we have anything material to add  
or to draw attention to in relation to:

• the disclosures in the Annual Report that 
describe those risks and explain how they 
are being managed or mitigated;
• the Directors’ statement in the financial 
statements about whether they considered 
it appropriate to adopt the going concern

their identification of any material 
uncertainties to the entity’s ability to 
continue to do so over a period of at least 
12 months from the date of approval of the 
financial statements; and
• the Directors’ explanation in the Annual 
Report as to how they have assessed the 
prospects of the entity, over what period 
they have done so and why they consider 
that period to be appropriate, and their 
statement as to whether they have a 
reasonable expectation that the entity will 
be able to continue in operation and meet 
its liabilities as they fall due over the period 
of their assessment, including any related 
disclosures drawing attention to any 
necessary qualifications or assumptions.
We have nothing material to add or to draw 
attention to.

1. Background
In 2014 the JSC Insurance Company Aldagi (“ Aldagi”) and its subsidiaries (“ Aldagi group”) began a corporate reorganisation in order to 
separate the healthcare services and medical insurance business, from the property and casualty insurance business.
As at 1 August 2014, Aldagi’s medical insurance business segment was separated and transferred to a newly established legal entity,  
JSC Insurance Company Imedi L (“Imedi L ”). At the same time, healthcare providers included in the Aldagi group were transferred to a 
newly established holding company, JSC Medical Corporation EVEX (“EVEX”).
Both Imedi L and EVEX have been ultimately owned by Bank of Georgia Holdings plc (“BGH”) since the commencement of reorganisation, 
but did not represent a group of entities until 27 August 2015, when BGH established a holding company, Georgia Healthcare Group PLC 
(“GHG” or the “Group”), and transferred its shares in Imedi L and EVEX to GHG. BGH changed its name to BGEO Group PLC (“BGEO”) 
in 2015.
Financial information related to the pre 27 August 2015 period has been prepared for GHG from the financial statements of the 
combined entities as if GHG had been established and the transfer of the BGH’s shares in EVEX and Imedi L had been completed as  
at 31 December 2013.
As at 31 December 2016 and 31 December 2015 the ultimate parent of GHG is BGEO Group PLC (“BGEO”), incorporated in London, 
England. GHG’s results are consolidated as part of BGEO’s financial statements.
The Group’s healthcare services business provides medical services to inpatient and outpatient customers through a network of hospitals 
and clinics throughout Georgia. Its medical insurance business offers a wide range of medical insurance products, including personal 
accident, term life insurance products bundled with medical insurance and travel insurance policies to corporate and retail clients. The 
Group’s pharma subsidiary, which was acquired in May 2016 (Note 5), offers a wide range of drugs as well as parapharmacy products.
In November 2015, Georgia Healthcare Group PLC, a public limited liability company newly incorporated in England, successfully placed  
its shares on the London Stock Exchange by way of a Premium Listing through an Initial Public Offering (“IPO”). The Offering comprised 
38,681,820 shares equating to an offering size of approximately GBP 66 million, representing approximately 29% of GHG’s share capital  
on Admission, excluding the Over-allotment Option. Citigroup Global Markets Limited was granted an over-allotment option exercised in 
November 2015 in respect of up to 3,868,180 shares, representing approximately 10% of the offering.
The legal address of GHG PLC is No. 84 Brook Str., London W1K 5EH, United Kingdom. Company registration number is 09752452.
As at 31 December 2016 and 31 December 2015 the following shareholders owned more than 3% of the total outstanding shares of the 
Group. Other shareholders individually owned less than 3% of the outstanding shares.

2. Basis of preparation
Basis of preparation
In accordance with the exemption permitted under section 408 of the Companies Act 2006, the stand-alone income statement of GHG is 
not presented as part of these accounts.
The Company’s and Group’s consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards 
(“IFRS”) and IFRS Interpretations Committee (“IFRIC”) interpretations endorsed by the European Union (“EU”), and with those parts of 
the Companies Act 2006 applicable to companies reporting under IFRS. The principal accounting policies applied in the preparation of these 
consolidated financial statements are set out below. These policies have been consistently applied to all the periods presented, with 
exception of IAS 16 (refer to Note 11).
The consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a historical cost basis, except for investment properties, land and office 
buildings and hospitals and clinics classified as property and equipment and derivative financial instruments that have been measured at  
fair value. These consolidated financial statements have been presented in thousands of Georgian Lari (“GEL ”), except otherwise stated.
Going concern
GHG’s Board of Directors has made an assessment of the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern and is satisfied that it has the 
resources to continue in business for a period of at least 12 months from the approval of the financial statements. Furthermore, 
management is not aware of any material uncertainties that may cast significant doubt upon the Group’s ability to continue as a going 
concern. Therefore, the financial statements continue to be prepared on the going concern basis.
Reclassifications
During 2016 the Group reconsidered the presentation of its consolidated statement of financial position for the purpose of more accurate 
presentation of certain accounts stated in the table below. The presentation of comparative figures has been adjusted to conform to the 
presentation of the current period amounts:

3. Summary of significant accounting policies
Changes in accounting policies
The accounting policies adopted in the preparation of the annual consolidated financial statements are consistent with those followed in the 
preparation of the Group’s annual consolidated financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2015. The Group has not early adopted 
any standard, interpretation or amendment that has been issued but is not yet effective.
The nature and the effect of these changes are disclosed below. Although these new standards and amendments apply for the first time  
in 2016, they do not have a material impact on the annual consolidated financial statements of the Group or the interim condensed 
consolidated financial statements of the Group. The nature and the impact of each new standard or amendment are described below.
Basis of consolidation
The consolidated financial statements comprise the financial statements of GHG and its subsidiaries as at 31 December 2016. 
Consolidation of a subsidiary begins when the Group obtains control over the subsidiary and ceases when the Group loses control of the 
subsidiary. Control is achieved when the Group is exposed, or has rights, to variable returns from its involvement with the investee and 
has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the investee. Specifically, the Group controls an investee if and only if the 
Group has:
• power over the investee (i.e. existing rights that give it the current ability to direct the relevant activities of the investee);
• exposure, or rights, to variable returns from its involvement with the investee; and
• the ability to use its power over the investee to affect its returns.
When the Group has less than a majority of the voting or similar rights of an investee, the Group considers all relevant facts and 
circumstances in assessing whether it has power over an investee, including:
• the contractual arrangement with the other vote holders of the investee;
• rights arising from other contractual arrangements; and
• the Group’s voting rights and potential voting rights. 138

3. Summary of significant accounting policies continued
Basis of consolidation continued
The Group re-assesses whether or not it controls an investee if facts and circumstances indicate that there are changes to one or more of 
the three elements of control. Assets, liabilities, income and expenses of a subsidiary acquired or disposed of during the year are included 
in the statement of comprehensive income from the date the Group gains control until the date the Group ceases to control the subsidiary.
Profit or loss and each component of other comprehensive income are attributed to the equity holders of the Group and to the non-
controlling interests, even if this results in the non-controlling interests having a deficit balance.
When necessary, adjustments are made to the financial statements of subsidiaries to bring their accounting policies into line with the 
Group’s accounting policies. All intra-Group assets and liabilities, equity, income, expenses and cash flows relating to transactions between 
members of the Group are eliminated in full on consolidation.
Business combinations are accounted for using the acquisition method. The cost of an acquisition is measured as the aggregate of the 
consideration transferred measured at acquisition date fair value and the amount of any non-controlling interests in the acquiree. For each 
business combination, the Group elects whether to measure the non-controlling interests in the acquiree at fair value or at the 
proportionate share of the acquiree’ s identifiable net assets and other components of non-controlling interests at their acquisition date fair 
values. Acquisition-related costs are expensed as incurred and included in other operating expenses.
Goodwill is initially measured at cost, being the excess of the aggregate of the consideration transferred and the amount recognised for 
non-controlling interests, and any previous interest held, over the net identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed. If the fair value of 
the net assets acquired is in excess of the aggregate consideration transferred, the Group re-assesses whether it has correctly identified all 
of the assets acquired and all of the liabilities assumed and reviews the procedures used to measure the amounts to be recognised at the 
acquisition date. If the re-assessment still results in an excess of the fair value of net assets acquired over the aggregate consideration 
transferred, then the gain is recognised in profit or loss.
When the Group acquires a business, it assesses the financial assets and liabilities assumed for appropriate classification and designation in 
accordance with the contractual terms, economic circumstances and pertinent conditions as at the acquisition date. This includes the 
separation of embedded derivatives in host contracts by the acquiree.
Any contingent consideration to be transferred by the acquirer is recognised at fair value at the acquisition date. Contingent consideration 
classified as an asset or liability that is a financial instrument and within the scope of IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and 
Measurement, is measured at fair value with changes in fair value recognised either in either profit or loss or as a change to other 
comprehensive income. If the contingent consideration is not within the scope of IAS 39, it is measured in accordance with the appropriate 
IFRS. Contingent consideration that is classified as equity is not re-measured and subsequent settlement is accounted for within equity. 
Refer to Note 20.
Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents consist of cash on hand, current accounts and amounts due from credit institutions that mature within three 
months from the date of origination, that are readily convertible to known amounts of cash, are subject to insignificant risk of changes in 
value and are free from contractual encumbrances.
Receivables from healthcare services; receivables from sales of pharmaceuticals
Receivables from healthcare services and receivables from sales of pharmaceuticals are recognised initially at the transaction price deemed 
to be fair value at origination date. They are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method, less any 
provision for impairment. The carrying value of healthcare receivables is reviewed for impairment whenever events or circumstances 
indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable, with any impairment loss recorded in the consolidated profit or loss.
Financial assets
Financial assets in the scope of IAS 39 are classified either as financial assets at fair value through profit or loss, loans and receivables or 
available-for-sale financial assets, as appropriate. When financial assets are recognised initially, they are measured at fair value, plus, in the 
case of assets not at fair value through profit or loss, directly attributable transaction costs. The Group determines the classification of its 
financial assets upon initial recognition. The Group does not have any financial assets designated as available-for-sale or at fair value through 
profit or loss.
The classification depends on the purpose for which the investments were acquired or originated.
Loans and receivables are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted on an active market. 
These investments are initially recognised at cost, which is the fair value of the consideration paid for the acquisition of the investment. All 
transaction costs directly attributable to the acquisition are also included in the cost of the investment. Subsequent to initial recognition, 
these investments are carried at amortised cost using the effective interest method. The effective interest method is a method of 
calculating the amortised cost of a financial asset or a financial liability (or group of financial assets or financial liabilities) and of allocating 
the interest income or interest expense over the relevant period.  139

3. Summary of significant accounting policies continued
Financial assets continued
As part of its risk management, the Group uses foreign exchange option and forward contracts to manage exposures resulting from 
changes in foreign currency exchange rates. Such financial instruments are measured at fair value. Derivatives are carried as assets when 
their fair value is positive and as liabilities when it is negative. Gains and losses resulting from the derivative contracts are included in the 
consolidated profit or loss in net gains/(losses) from foreign currencies.
Allowances for impairment of financial assets
The Group assesses at each reporting date whether a financial asset or group of financial assets is impaired.
If there is objective evidence that an impairment loss on financial assets carried at amortised cost has been incurred, the amount of the loss 
is measured as the difference between the asset’s carrying amount and the present value of estimated future cash flows (excluding future 
credit losses that have not been incurred) discounted at the financial asset’s original effective interest rate. The amount of the impairment 
loss is recognised in the consolidated profit or loss.
Carried at amortised cost
The calculation of the present value of the estimated future cash flows of a collateralised financial asset reflects the cash flows that may 
result from foreclosure less costs for obtaining and selling the collateral, whether or not the foreclosure is probable.
The Group first assesses whether objective evidence of impairment exists individually for financial assets that are individually significant, 
and individually or collectively for financial assets that are not individually significant. If it is determined that no objective evidence of 
impairment exists for an individually assessed financial asset, whether significant or not, the asset is included in a group of financial assets 
with similar credit risk characteristics and that group of financial assets is collectively assessed for impairment. Assets that are individually 
assessed for impairment and for which an impairment loss is or continues to be recognised are not included in a collective assessment 
of impairment.
If, in a subsequent period, the amount of the impairment loss decreases and the decrease can be related objectively to an event occurring 
after the impairment was recognised, the previously recognised impairment loss is reversed. Any subsequent reversal of an impairment 
loss is recognised in the consolidated profit or loss, to the extent that the carrying value of the asset does not exceed its amortised cost at 
the reversal date.
When an asset is uncollectible, it is written off against the related allowance for impairment. Such assets are written off after all necessary 
procedures have been completed and the amount of the loss has been determined. Subsequent recoveries of amounts previously written 
off decrease the charge for impairment of financial assets in the consolidated profit or loss.
Derecognition of financial instruments
Financial assets
A financial asset (or, if applicable, a part of a financial asset or part of a group of similar financial assets) is derecognised when the following 
conditions are met:
• the rights to receive cash flows from the asset have expired;
• the Group has transferred its right to receive cash flows from the asset, or retained the right to receive cash flows from the asset but 
has assumed an obligation to pay them in full without material delay to a third party under a ‘pass-through’ arrangement; and
• the Group either (a) has transferred substantially all the risks and rewards of the asset, or (b) has neither transferred nor retained 
substantially all the risks and rewards of the asset, but has transferred control of the asset.
Where the Group has transferred its right to receive cash flows from an asset and has neither transferred nor retained substantially all the 
risks and rewards of the asset nor transferred control of the asset, the asset is recognised to the extent of the Group’s continuing 
involvement in the asset. Continuing involvement that takes the form of a guarantee over the transferred asset that is measured at the 
lower of the original carrying amount of the asset and the maximum amount of consideration that the Group could be required to repay.
Borrowings
A borrowing is derecognised when the obligation under the liability is discharged or cancelled or expires and if its terms are 
substantially modified.
Offsetting
Financial assets and liabilities are offset and the net amount is reported in the consolidated statement of financial position when there is a 
legally enforceable right to set off the recognised amounts and there is an intention to settle on a net basis or to realise the asset and settle 
the liability simultaneously. Income and expense will not be offset in the profit or loss unless required or permitted by any accounting 
standard or interpretation. The Group has not offset any of its assets and liabilities or income and expenses. 140

3. Summary of significant accounting policies continued
Insurance contracts
Insurance contracts are defined as those containing significant insurance risk at the inception of the contract or those where at the 
inception of the contract there is a scenario with commercial substance where the level of insurance risk may be significant. The 
significance of insurance risk is dependent on both the probability of an insured event and the magnitude of its potential effect.
Once a contract has been classified as an insurance contract, it remains an insurance contract for the remainder of its lifetime, even if the 
insurance risk reduces significantly during this period, unless all rights and obligations are extinguished or expire.
Insurance premiums receivables
Insurance premiums receivable are recognised based upon insurance policy terms and measured at cost. The carrying value of insurance 
premiums receivable is reviewed for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be 
recoverable, with any impairment loss recorded in the consolidated profit or loss.
Insurance contract liabilities
The provision is recognised when contracts are entered into and premiums are charged, and is brought to account as premium income over 
the term of the contract in accordance with the pattern of insurance service provided under the contract. At each reporting date the carrying 
amount of unearned premium is calculated on active policies based on the insurance period and time until the expiration date of each 
insurance policy. The Group reviews its unexpired risk based on the historical performance of separate business lines to determine the 
overall change in expected claims. The differences between the unearned premium reserves, loss provisions and the expected claims are 
recognised in the consolidated profit or loss by setting up a provision for premium deficiency.
Deferred acquisition costs
Deferred acquisition costs (“DAC”) are capitalised costs related to the issuance of insurance policies. They consist of commissions paid to 
agents, brokers and some employees. They are amortised on a straight-line basis over the life of the contract.
Fair value measurement
The Group revalues at fair value at each balance sheet date derivatives and hospitals and clinics, land and office buildings. If their fair value 
differs materially from carrying value. Fair values of financial instruments measured at amortised cost are disclosed in Note 40.
Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market 
participants at the measurement date. The fair value measurement is based on the presumption that the transaction to sell the asset or 
transfer the liability takes place either:
• in the principal market for the asset or liability; or
• in the absence of a principal market, in the most advantageous market for the asset or liability.
The principal or the most advantageous market must be accessible by the Group. The fair value of an asset or a liability is measured using 
the assumptions that market participants would use when pricing the asset or liability, assuming that market participants act in their 
economic best interest. A fair value measurement of a non-financial asset takes into account a market participant’s ability to generate 
economic benefits by using the asset in its highest and best use or by selling it to another market participant that would use the asset in its 
highest and best use.
Property and equipment
Property and equipment except for land and office buildings and hospitals and clinics are carried at cost less accumulated depreciation and 
any accumulated impairment in value. Such cost includes the cost of replacing part of equipment when that cost is incurred if the 
recognition criteria are met.
Included in hospitals and clinics category are buildings and related land in which referral hospitals, community hospitals and ambulatory 
clinics are placed. 
The carrying values of property and equipment are reviewed for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the 
carrying value may not be recoverable. Impairment losses are recognised in the consolidated profit or loss as an expense.
Following initial recognition at cost, land and office buildings and hospitals and clinics are carried at a revalued amount, which is the fair 
value at the date of the revaluation less any subsequent accumulated depreciation and subsequent accumulated impairment losses. 
Valuations are performed frequently enough (market value changes are monitored at least once in a year) to ensure that the fair value of a 
revalued asset does not differ materially from its carrying amount.
If an asset’s carrying amount is increased as a result of a revaluation, the increase shall be recognised in other comprehensive income  
and accumulated in equity in other reserves. However, the increase shall be recognised in profit or loss to the extent that it reverses a 
revaluation decrease of the same asset previously recognised in profit or loss. If an asset’s carrying amount is decreased as a result of a 
revaluation, the decrease shall be recognised in profit or loss. However, the decrease shall be recognised in other comprehensive income to 
the extent of any credit balance existing in the revaluation surplus in respect of that asset. The decrease recognised in other comprehensive 
income reduces the amount accumulated in other reserves in equity.

3. Summary of significant accounting policies continued
Property and equipment continued
Accumulated depreciation as at the revaluation date is eliminated against the gross carrying amount of the asset and the net amount is 
restated to the revalued amount of the asset. Upon disposal, any revaluation reserve relating to the particular asset being sold is transferred 
to retained earnings. Depreciation of an asset begins when it is available for use. Depreciation is calculated on a straight-line basis over the 
following estimated useful lives:
Y ears
Office buildings 100
Hospitals and clinics 100
Leasehold improvements 10
Furniture and fixtures 5-10
Medical equipment 5-10
Computers 5
Motor vehicles 5
The asset’s residual value and useful life are reviewed, and adjusted as appropriate, at each financial year-end.
Costs related to repairs and renewals are charged when incurred and included in general and administrative expenses unless they qualify 
for capitalisation.
An item of property and equipment is derecognised upon disposal or when no further future economic benefits are expected from its use 
or disposal. Any gain or loss arising on derecognising of the asset (calculated as the difference between the net disposal proceeds and the 
carrying amount of the asset) is included in the consolidated profit or loss in the period the asset is derecognised.
Assets under construction comprises costs directly related to construction of property and equipment including an appropriate allocation of 
directly attributable variable and fixed overheads that are incurred in construction. Depreciation of these assets, on the same basis as similar 
property assets, commences when the assets are ready for use.
Leasehold improvements are depreciated over the shorter of ten years or the life of the related leased asset. The asset’s residual value and 
useful life are reviewed, and adjusted as appropriate, at each financial year-end.
Inventory
Inventory comprises medical supplies and non-medical supplies and is valued at the lower of cost and net realisable value. The cost of 
inventory is determined on a weighted average basis in the healthcare services segment and first in first out basis (“FIFO”) in the pharma 
segment and includes expenditure incurred in acquiring inventory and bringing it to its existing location and condition. 
Borrowings
Borrowings are initially recognised at the fair value of the consideration received less directly attributable transaction costs. After initial 
recognition, borrowings are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method. Gains and losses are recognised 
in the consolidated profit or loss when the borrowings are derecognised as well as through the amortisation process.
Borrowing costs
Borrowing costs comprise interest expense calculated using the effective interest method and exchange differences arising from foreign 
currency borrowings to the extent that they are regarded as an adjustment to interest costs.
Borrowing costs directly attributable to the acquisition, construction or production of an asset that necessarily takes a substantial period of 
time to get ready for its intended use or sale are capitalised as part of the cost of such asset. All other borrowing costs are expensed in 
the year in which they occur. Borrowing costs consist of interest and other costs that an entity incurs in connection with the borrowing 
of funds.
T axation
The current income tax expense is calculated in accordance with the regulations in force in Georgia.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are calculated in respect of temporary differences using the liability method. Deferred income taxes are 
provided for all temporary differences arising between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying values for financial reporting 
purposes, except where the deferred income tax arises from the initial recognition of goodwill or of an asset or liability in a transaction that 
is not a business combination and, at the time of the transaction, affects neither the accounting profit nor taxable profit or loss.
A deferred tax asset is recorded only to the extent that it is probable that taxable profit will be available against which the deductible 
temporary differences can be utilised. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured at tax rates that are expected to apply to the year 
when the asset is realised or the liability is settled, based on tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the 
reporting date. 142

T axation continued
Deferred income tax is provided on temporary differences arising on investments in subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures, except 
where the timing of the reversal of the temporary difference can be controlled and it is probable that the temporary difference will not 
reverse in the foreseeable future.
Georgia also has various operating taxes that are assessed on the Group’s activities. These taxes are included as a component of general 
and administrative expenses.
Intangible assets
Intangible assets include computer software and licenses.
Intangible assets acquired separately are measured on initial recognition at cost. The cost of intangible assets acquired in a business 
combination is fair value as at the date of acquisition. Following initial recognition, intangible assets are carried at cost less any accumulated 
amortisation and any accumulated impairment losses. Intangible assets are amortised over the useful economic lives of such assets of 
between four to ten years and assessed for impairment whenever there is an indication that the intangible asset may be impaired. 
Amortisation periods for intangible assets with finite useful lives are reviewed at least at each financial year-end.
Costs associated with maintaining computer software programmes are recorded as an expense as incurred. Software development costs 
(relating to the design and testing of new or substantially improved software) are recognised as intangible assets only when the Group can 
demonstrate the technical feasibility of completing the software so that it will be available for use or sale, its intention to complete and its 
ability to use or sell the asset, how the asset will generate future economic benefits, the availability of resources to complete and the ability 
to measure reliably the expenditure during the development. Other software development costs are recognised as an expense as incurred.
Provisions and contingent liabilities
Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of past events, and it is probable that an 
outflow of resources embodying economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation and a reliable estimate of the amount of 
obligation can be made.
Where the Group expects a provision to be reimbursed, for example under an insurance contract, the reimbursement is recognised as an 
asset but only when it is virtually certain that it will be received.
Share-based compensation transactions
Senior executives of the Group receive share-based compensation, whereby employees render services as consideration for the equity 
instruments of BGEO or GHG. Share-based compensation plans announced by BGEO and GHG represent equity-settled transactions. 
Share-based compensation plans are recognised as equity by crediting directly to equity.
Equity-settled transactions
The cost of equity-settled transactions with employees is measured by reference to the fair value of the equity instruments granted at the 
date of the transaction. The cost of equity-settled transactions is recognised together with the corresponding increase in additional paid-in 
capital, over the period in which the performance and/or service conditions are fulfilled, ending on the date when the relevant employee is 
fully entitled to the award (the “vesting date”). The cumulative expense recognised for equity settled transactions at each reporting date 
until the vesting date reflects the extent to which the vesting period has expired and the Group’s best estimate of the number of equity 
instruments that will ultimately vest. The consolidated profit or loss charge for the period represents the movement in cumulative expense 
recognised as at the beginning and end of that period.
Equity
Share capital
Ordinary shares are classified as equity. External costs directly attributable to the issue of new shares, other than on a business 
combination, are shown as a deduction from the proceeds in equity. Any excess of the fair value of consideration received over the par 
value of shares issued is recognised as additional paid-in capital.
Dividends
Dividends are recognised as a liability and deducted from equity at the reporting date only if they are declared before or on the reporting 
date. Dividends are disclosed when they are proposed before the reporting date or proposed or declared after the reporting date but before 
the financial statements are authorised for issue.
Income and expense recognition
Interest income
For all financial instruments measured at amortised cost and interest-bearing financial assets classified as loans and receivables, interest 
income is recorded using the effective interest rate (“EIR”). The EIR is the rate that exactly discounts the estimated future cash receipts 
over the expected life of the financial instrument or a shorter period, where appropriate, to the net carrying amount of the financial asset. 
Interest income is included in finance income in the statement of profit or loss.

Healthcare services revenue and revenue from pharma
The Group recognises revenue when the amount of revenue can be reliably measured and it is probable that future economic benefits  
will flow to the entity. Revenue is presented net of corrections and rebates that occasionally arise as a result of reconciliation of detailed 
bills with counterparties (mostly with the State). Proposed corrections and rebates are identified by the customers (mostly by the State) 
only upon or subsequent to the official act of acceptance for the invoices submitted by the Group. The proposed corrections are further 
discussed by the Group with the respective counterparties and either agreed upon and recognised or further disputed, sometimes through 
litigation. Corrections and rebates may arise only subsequent to official submission of the invoice by the Group and the official acceptance 
of the invoice by the counterparty. The Group’s gross revenue (before deducting its corrections and rebates) is based on the official invoices 
submitted to and formally accepted by the customers (State, insurance companies, provider clinics and individuals) and accruals for already 
performed but not yet billed service.
Healthcare services revenue comprises the fair value of the consideration received or receivable for providing inpatient and outpatient 
services and include the following components:
• Healthcare services revenue from the State – The Group recognises the revenue from the individuals who are insured under the State 
programmes based on the completion of the actual medical service and the agreed-upon terms between the counterparties.
• Healthcare services revenue from insurance companies – The Group recognises revenue from the individuals who are insured by various 
insurance companies based on the completion of the actual medical service and agreed-upon terms between the counterparties.
• Healthcare services revenue from out-of-pocket and other – The Group recognises the revenue from non-insured individuals based on 
the completion of the actual medical service and approved prices by the Group. Sales are usually in cash or by credit card. Other revenue 
from medical services includes revenue from municipalities and other hospitals, which the Group has contractual relationship with. Sales 
of services are recognised in the accounting period in which the services are rendered and are calculated according to contractual tariffs.
Revenue from pharma comprises the fair value of the consideration received or receivable both from wholesale and retail sales and drug 
exchange transactions. The pharma business sometimes receives drugs in exchange for sale of drugs from other wholesalers. The 
consideration received is assessed with reference to its actual wholesale price which is deemed fair value of consideration received. 
Customer loyalty programme points accumulated in the pharma business are treated as deferred revenue and recognised in revenues 
gradually as they are earned. At reach reporting date the Group estimates portion of accumulated points that is expected to be utilised by 
customers based on statistical data. Those points are treated as liability in the statement of financial position and are only recognised in 
revenues when points are used by customers.
Hedge accounting
The Group has adopted fair value hedge accounting in accordance with IAS 39 for foreign exchange component of two of its fixed assets. 
IAS 39.82 allows hedging of non-financial items either: (a) for foreign currency risks, or (b) in its entirety for all risks. Due to strong a 
correlation between real estate prices in Lari terms and Dollar-GEL exchange rates published by the National Bank of Georgia, holding  
other factors constant, we designated Dollar denominated borrowings as a hedging instrument and the foreign exchange component of  
the fixed asset price change as the hedged item. The Group continues to assess hedge effectiveness on a quarterly basis. If hedge 
effectiveness conditions will hold and hedge is found to be effective any increase (decrease) in the value of hedged real estate caused  
by changes in Dollar exchange rate will be offset by an equivalent increase (decrease) of Dollar denominated borrowing. If the hedge is 
found to be partially ineffective, to the extent these amounts differ, a net amount is recognised in profit or loss, in net (losses)/gains from 
foreign currencies. The recognition of the latter difference is commonly referred to as the measurement of hedge ineffectiveness. As at 
31 December 2016 fair value of financial instruments designated as hedging instruments equalled GEL 15,629. We also considered IFRS 9 
requirements below.
Net insurance premiums earned
Insurance premiums written are recognised on policy inception and earned on a pro rata basis over the term of the related policy coverage. 
Premiums written reflect business commenced during the period, and exclude any sales-based taxes or duties. Unearned premiums are 
those proportions of the premiums written in a period that relate to periods after the reporting date. Unearned premiums are computed on 
monthly pro rata basis.
Unearned premium reserve
The proportion of written premiums attributable to subsequent periods is deferred as unearned premium. The change in the unearned 
premium reserve is taken to the consolidated profit or loss in the order that revenue is recognised over the period of risk or, for annuities, 
the amount of expected future benefit payments.
Cost of healthcare services and cost of sales of pharmaceuticals
Cost of healthcare services represents expenses directly related to the generation of revenue from healthcare services rendered, including 
but not limited to salaries and benefits of medical personnel, materials and supplies, utilities and other direct costs.
Cost of sales of pharmaceuticals represents cost of sold drugs calculated using First-In First-Out (“FIFO”) method.
Net claims incurred
Insurance claims incurred include all claim losses occurring during the period, whether reported or not, including the related handling costs 
and other recoveries and any adjustments to claims outstanding from previous periods. Claims handling costs include internal and external 
costs incurred in connection with the negotiation and settlement of claims, such as salaries of general practitioners. Internal costs include 
all direct expenses of the claims department and any part of the general administrative costs directly attributable to the claims function. 144

EBITDA
The Group separately presents EBITDA on the face of statement of comprehensive income. EBITDA is defined as earnings before 
interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation and is derived as the Group’s profit before income tax expense but excluding the following 
line items: depreciation and amortisation, interest income, interest expense, net losses from foreign currencies and net non-recurring 
(expense)/income.
Net non-recurring (expense)/income
The Group separately classifies and discloses those income and expenses that are non-recurring by nature. Any type of income or expense 
may be non-recurring by nature. The Group defines non-recurring income or expense as income or expense triggered by or originated from 
an unusual economic, business or financial event that is not inherent to the regular and ordinary business course of the Group and is 
caused by uncertain or unpredictable external factors.
Foreign currency translation
The consolidated financial statements are presented in Georgian Lari, which is the Group’s presentation currency and functional currency  
of all the Group’s components. Transactions in foreign currencies are initially recorded in the functional currency, converted at the rate of 
exchange ruling at the date of the transaction. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated into Georgian 
Lari at official exchange rates declared by the National Bank of Georgia (“NBG”) and effective as at the reporting date. Gains and losses 
resulting from the translation of foreign currency transactions are recognised in the consolidated profit or loss within net losses from 
foreign currencies.
Differences between the contractual exchange rate of a transaction in a foreign currency and the NBG exchange rate on the date of the 
transaction are included in net losses from foreign currencies in the consolidated profit or loss. The official NBG exchange rates at 
31 December 2016 and 31 December 2015 were 2.6468 and 2.3949 Georgian Lari to 1 Dollar, respectively.
New and amended standards and interpretations
The standards and interpretations relevant to the Group that are issued up to the date of issuance of the Group’s financial statements are 
disclosed below. The Group intends to adopt these standards, if applicable, when they become effective (apart from IFRS 15 which the 
Group intends to adopt starting 1 January 2017). 
IFRS 9 Financial Instruments
In July 2014, the IASB issued the final version of IFRS 9 Financial Instruments that replaces IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and 
Measurement and all previous versions of IFRS 9. IFRS 9 brings together all three aspects of the accounting for financial instruments 
project: classification and measurement, impairment and hedge accounting. IFRS 9 is effective for annual periods beginning on or after 
1 January 2018, with early application permitted. Except for hedge accounting, retrospective application is required but providing 
comparative information is not compulsory. For hedge accounting, the requirements are generally applied prospectively, with some limited 
exceptions. The adoption of IFRS 9 will have an effect on the classification and measurement of the Group’s financial assets, but no impact 
on the classification and measurement of the Group’s financial liabilities.
(a) Classification and measurement
The Group does not expect a significant impact on its balance sheet or equity on applying the classification and measurement requirements 
of IFRS 9. It expects to continue measuring at fair value all financial assets currently held at fair value. These amendments are expected to 
have an impact on the Group given the extent of financial assets and liabilities currently carried at amortised cost.
(b) Impairment
IFRS 9 requires the Group to record expected credit losses on all of its debt securities, loans and trade receivables, either on a 12-month or 
lifetime basis. The Group expects to apply the simplified approach and record lifetime expected losses on all trade receivables. The Group 
does not expect a significant impact on its equity due to the relatively short-term nature of its receivables, but it will need to perform a 
more detailed analysis which considers all reasonable and supportable information, including forward-looking elements to determine the 
extent of the impact.
(c) Hedge accounting
The Group believes that all existing hedge relationships that are currently designated in effective hedging relationships will still qualify for 
hedge accounting under IFRS 9. As IFRS 9 does not change the general principles of how an entity accounts for effective hedges, the 
Group does not expect a significant impact as a result of applying IFRS 9. The Group will assess possible changes related to the accounting 
for the time value of options, forward points or the currency basis spread in more detail in the future.
IFRS 14 Regulatory Deferral Accounts
IFRS 14 is an optional standard that allows an entity, whose activities are subject to rate-regulation, to continue applying most of its existing 
accounting policies for regulatory deferral account balances upon its first-time adoption of IFRS. Entities that adopt IFRS 14 must present 
the regulatory deferral accounts as separate line items on the statement of financial position and present movements in these account 
balances as separate line items in the statement of profit or loss and OCI. The standard requires disclosure of the nature of, and risks 
associated with, the entity’s rate-regulation and the effects of that rate-regulation on its financial statements. IFRS 14 is effective for annual 
periods beginning on or after 1 January 2016. Since the Group is an existing IFRS preparer, this standard would not apply.

IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers
IFRS 15 was issued in May 2014 and establishes a five-step model to account for revenue arising from contracts with customers. Under 
IFRS 15, revenue is recognised at an amount that reflects the consideration to which an entity expects to be entitled in exchange for 
transferring goods or services to a customer.
The new revenue standard will supersede all current revenue recognition requirements under IFRS. Either a full retrospective application  
or a modified retrospective application is required for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2018. Early adoption is permitted.  
The Group plans to early adopt the new standard starting 1 January 2017 using modified retrospective application method. During 2016,  
the Group performed a preliminary assessment of IFRS 15, which is subject to changes arising from a more detailed ongoing analysis.
(a) Revenue from sales of pharmaceuticals and Revenue from healthcare services
The accounting for pharma contracts with wholesale customers in which drugs sale is the only performance obligation is not expected to 
change as a result of IFRS 15. The Group expects the revenue recognition to occur at a point in time when control of the asset is transferred 
to the customer, generally on delivery of the goods.
In applying IFRS 15, the Group considered the following:
(i) Variable consideration
Invoices sent to state and insurance companies are subject to follow up from counterparties that have a predetermined period to correct 
invoices in case of any substantive or technical errors. Currently, the Group recognises the effect of corrections and rebates when it 
receives corrected invoices. IFRS 15 requires the estimated variable consideration to be constrained to prevent over-recognition of revenue. 
Due to the provisions of IFRS 15, invoice corrections fall under the definition of variable consideration under IFRS 15, and will be required to 
be estimated at contract inception. Due to the fact that corrected invoices are sometimes received with a three-month lag, estimation is a 
necessary. The Group estimates the 2017 year impact to be approximately GEL 1,049. 
(ii) Warranty obligations
Due to the nature of its business activities, the Group does not provide any warranties to clients.
(iii) Loyalty points programme (Zgarbi)
The Group determines that the loyalty programme offered within the pharma business gives rise to a separate performance obligation 
because it provides a material right to the customer. Thus, it will need to allocate a portion of the transaction price to the loyalty programme 
based on relative stand-alone selling price. The Group believes that the current accounting treatment applied to the customer loyalty 
programme is substantially in line with IFRS 15 requirements. The Group is still analysing contracts with customers that have such elements 
and will need to perform further assessments in the future to quantify the financial impact to its financial statements.
(b) Rendering of services
The Group provides healthcare services to clients. The Group has assessed that the services are satisfied over time given that the customer 
simultaneously receives and consumes the benefits provided by the Group. Consequently, the Group does not expect any significant 
impact to arise from these service contracts as a result of IFRS 15.
(c) Equipment received from customers
When an entity receives, or expects to receive, non-cash consideration, IFRS 15 requires that the fair value of the non-cash consideration is 
included in the transaction price. An entity would have to measure the fair value of the non-cash consideration in accordance with IFRS 13 
Fair Value Measurement. The Group’s pharma business sometimes receives drugs in exchange for sale of drugs from other wholesalers  
(so called “netting”). The consideration received is assessed with reference to its actual wholesale price. This is consistent with the 
requirements of IFRS 15 and therefore the Group does not expect IFRS 15 to have any significant impact in this area.
Amendments to IFRS 11 Joint Arrangements: Accounting for Acquisitions of Interests
The amendments to IFRS 11 require that a joint operator accounting for the acquisition of an interest in a joint operation, in which the 
activity of the joint operation constitutes a business, must apply the relevant IFRS 3 principles for business combinations accounting. The 
amendments also clarify that a previously held interest in a joint operation is not remeasured on the acquisition of an additional interest in 
the same joint operation while joint control is retained. In addition, a scope exclusion has been added to IFRS 11 to specify that the 
amendments do not apply when the parties sharing joint control, including the reporting entity, are under common control of the same 
ultimate controlling party. The amendments apply to both the acquisition of the initial interest in a joint operation and the acquisition of any 
additional interests in the same joint operation and are prospectively effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2016, with 
early adoption permitted. These amendments are not expected to have any impact on the Group.
Amendments to IAS 16 and IAS 38: Clarification of Acceptable Methods of Depreciation and Amortisation
The amendments clarify the principle in IAS 16 and IAS 38 that revenue reflects a pattern of economic benefits that are generated from 
operating a business (of which the asset is part) rather than the economic benefits that are consumed through use of the asset. As a result, 
a revenue-based method cannot be used to depreciate property, plant and equipment and may only be used in very limited circumstances 
to amortise intangible assets. The amendments are effective prospectively for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2016, with 
early adoption permitted. These amendments are not expected to have any impact to the Group given that the Group has not used a 
revenue-based method to depreciate its non-current assets. 146

Amendments to IAS 16 and IAS 41 Agriculture: Bearer Plants
The amendments change the accounting requirements for biological assets that meet the definition of bearer plants. Under the 
amendments, biological assets that meet the definition of bearer plants will no longer be within the scope of IAS 41 . Instead, IAS 16 will 
apply. After initial recognition, bearer plants will be measured under IAS 16 at accumulated cost (before maturity) and using either the cost 
model or revaluation model after maturity). The amendments also require that produce that grows on bearer plants will remain in the scope 
of IAS 41 measured at fair value less costs to sell. For Government grants related to bearer plants, IAS 20 Accounting for Government 
Grants and Disclosure of Government Assistance will apply. The amendments are retrospectively effective for annual periods beginning on 
or after 1 January 2016, with early adoption permitted. These amendments are not expected to have any impact to the Group as the Group 
does not have any bearer plants.
Amendments to IAS 27: Equity Method in Separate Financial Statements
The amendments allow entities to use the equity method to account for investments in subsidiaries, joint ventures and associates in  
their separate financial statements. Entities already applying IFRS and electing to change to the equity method in its separate financial 
statements will have to apply that change retrospectively. For first-time adopters of IFRS electing to use the equity method in its separate 
financial statements, they are required to apply this method from the date of transition to IFRS. The amendments are effective for annual 
periods beginning on or after 1 January 2016, with early adoption permitted. These amendments did not have any impact on the Group’s 
consolidated financial statements. 
Amendments to IFRS 10 and IAS 28: Sale or Contribution of Assets between an Investor and its Associate or Joint Venture
The amendments address the conflict between IFRS 10 and IAS 28 in dealing with the loss of control of a subsidiary that is sold or 
contributed to an associate or joint venture. The amendments clarify that the gain or loss resulting from the sale or contribution of assets 
that constitute a business, as defined in IFRS 3, between an investor and its associate or joint venture, is recognised in full. Any gain or loss 
resulting from the sale or contribution of assets that do not constitute a business, however, is recognised only to the extent of unrelated 
investors’ interests in the associate or joint venture. These amendments must be applied prospectively and are effective for annual periods 
beginning on or after 1 January 2016, with early adoption permitted. These amendments are not expected to have any impact on the Group.
Amendments to IAS 1 Disclosure Initiative
The amendments to IAS 1 clarify, rather than significantly change, existing IAS 1 requirements. The amendments clarify: 
• the materiality requirements in IAS 1; 
• that specific line items in the statement(s) of profit or loss and OCI and the statement of financial position may be disaggregated; 
• that entities have flexibility as to the order in which they present the notes to financial statements; and 
• that the share of OCI of associates and joint ventures accounted for using the equity method must be presented in aggregate as a single 
line item, and classified between those items that will or will not be subsequently reclassified to profit or loss. 
Furthermore, the amendments clarify the requirements that apply when additional subtotals are presented in the statement of financial 
position and the statement(s) of profit or loss and OCI. These amendments do not have any impact on the Group.
IFRS 16 Leases
IFRS 16 was issued in January 2016 and it replaces IAS 17 Leases, IFRIC 4 Determining whether an Arrangement contains a Lease, SIC-15 
Operating Leases-Incentives and SIC-27 Evaluating the Substance of Transactions Involving the Legal Form of a Lease. IFRS 16 sets out the 
principles for the recognition, measurement, presentation and disclosure of leases and requires lessees to account for all leases under a 
single on-balance sheet model similar to the accounting for finance leases under IAS 17 . The standard includes two recognition exemptions 
for lessees – leases of “low-value“ assets (e.g. personal computers) and short-term leases (i.e. leases with a lease term of 12 months or 
less). At the commencement date of a lease, a lessee will recognise a liability to make lease payments (i.e. the lease liability) and an asset 
representing the right to use the underlying asset during the lease term (i.e. the right-of-use asset). Lessees will be required to separately 
recognise the interest expense on the lease liability and the depreciation expense on the right-of-use asset.
Lessees will be also required to remeasure the lease liability upon the occurrence of certain events (e.g. a change in the lease term, a 
change in future lease payments resulting from a change in an index or rate used to determine those payments). The lessee will generally 
recognise the amount of the remeasurement of the lease liability as an adjustment to the right-of-use asset. 
Lessor accounting under IFRS 16 is substantially unchanged from today’s accounting under IAS 17 . Lessors will continue to classify all 
leases using the same classification principle as in IAS 17 and distinguish between two types of leases: operating and finance leases.
IFRS 16 also requires lessees and lessors to make more extensive disclosures than under IAS 17 .
IFRS 16 is effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2019. Early application is permitted, but not before an entity applies 
IFRS 15. A lessee can choose to apply the standard using either a full retrospective or a modified retrospective approach. The standard’s 
transition provisions permit certain reliefs.
In 2017 , the Group plans to assess the potential effect of IFRS 16 on its consolidated financial statements.

IAS 12 Recognition of Deferred Tax Assets for Unrealised Losses – Amendments to IAS 12
The amendments clarify that an entity needs to consider whether tax law restricts the sources of taxable profits against which it may make 
deductions on the reversal of that deductible temporary difference. Furthermore, the amendments provide guidance on how an entity 
should determine future taxable profits and explain the circumstances in which taxable profit may include the recovery of some assets for 
more than their carrying amount.
Entities are required to apply the amendments retrospectively. However, on initial application of the amendments, the change in the 
opening equity of the earliest comparative period may be recognised in the opening retained earnings (or in another component of equity, 
as appropriate), without allocating the change between opening retained earnings and other components of equity. Entities applying this 
relief must disclose that fact. These amendments are effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2017 with early application 
permitted. If an entity applies the amendments for an earlier period, it must disclose that fact. These amendments are not expected to have 
any impact on the Group.
Annual improvements 2012-2014 cycle
These improvements are effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2016. They include:
IFRS 5 Non-current Assets Held for Sale and Discontinued Operations
Assets (or disposal groups) are generally disposed of either through sale or distribution to owners. The amendment clarifies that changing 
from one of these disposal methods to the other would not be considered a new plan of disposal, rather it is a continuation of the original 
plan. There is, therefore, no interruption of the application of the requirements in IFRS 5. This amendment must be applied prospectively. 
This amendment did not have any impact on the Group.
IFRS 7 Financial Instruments: Disclosures
(i) Servicing contracts
The amendment clarifies that a servicing contract that includes a fee can constitute continuing involvement in a financial asset. An entity 
must assess the nature of the fee and the arrangement against the guidance for continuing involvement in IFRS 7 in order to assess 
whether the disclosures are required. The assessment of which servicing contracts constitute continuing involvement must be done 
retrospectively. However, the required disclosures would not need to be provided for any period beginning before the annual period in which 
the entity first applies the amendments. This amendment did not have any impact on the Group.
(ii) Applicability of the amendments to IFRS 7 to condensed interim financial statements
The amendment clarifies that the offsetting disclosure requirements do not apply to condensed interim financial statements, unless such 
disclosures provide a significant update to the information reported in the most recent Annual Report. This amendment must be applied 
retrospectively. This amendment did not have any impact on the Group. 
IAS 19 Employee Benefits
The amendment clarifies that market depth of high quality corporate bonds is assessed based on the currency in which the obligation is 
denominated, rather than the country where the obligation is located. When there is no deep market for high quality corporate bonds in that 
currency, Government bond rates must be used. This amendment must be applied prospectively. This amendment did not have any impact 
on the Group.
4. Significant accounting judgments and estimates
The preparation of the financial statements necessitates the use of estimates, assumptions and judgments. These estimates and 
assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and contingent liabilities at the reporting date as well as affecting the 
reported income and expenses for the period. Although the estimates are based on management’s best knowledge and judgment of 
current facts as at the reporting date, the actual outcome may differ from these estimates.
The key assumptions concerning the future and other key sources of estimation uncertainty at the reporting date, that have a significant risk 
of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial period are discussed below.
Goodwill impairment test
Significant accounting judgments and estimates related to goodwill impairment test are presented in Note 12.
Impairment of receivables from healthcare services
The impairment provision for receivables from healthcare services is based on the Group’s assessment of the collectability of specific 
customer accounts. If there is a sign of deterioration in an individually significant customer’s creditworthiness, the respective receivable is 
considered to be impaired. Key criteria for defining the signs of such deterioration is the customers’ debt services quality measured by the 
numbers of days in arrears (i.e. the number of days for overdue payments). Based on the respective analysis of the current and past debt 
services of the customers, the Group determines whether or not there is an objective evidence of an impairment. If yes, then the proper 
provision rate is applied, which reflects the credit risk associated with that particular category of debt services. If not, then the respective 
accounts receivable are assessed collectively, as a good quality, in a total pool for the good credit quality receivables, based on loss given 
default and the number of days overdue, which practically implies an immaterial amount of overdue days.  148

4. Significant accounting judgments and estimates continued
Impairment of receivables from healthcare services continued
For collective assessment purposes the management judgment is that historical trends can serve as a basis for predicting incurred losses 
and that this approach can be used to estimate the amount of recoverable debts as at the reporting period end.
Actual results may differ from the estimates and the Group’s estimates can be revised in the future, either negatively or positively, 
depending upon the outcome or expectations based on the facts surrounding each exposure. The amount of allowance for impairment of 
the healthcare receivables as at 31 December 2016 was GEL 11,030 (2015: GEL 7 ,829). Refer to Note 10.
Valuation of real estate
The fair value of real estate included in property and equipment is determined by independent professionally qualified appraisers. Fair value 
is determined using a combination of the so called sales comparison method. The Group performs valuation of its office buildings and 
hospitals and clinics once in every three years, unless there is a sign of material change in fair values on the market. First time valuation of 
hospitals and clinics was performed on 1 July 2016 by Georgian Valuation Company. Results of this valuation are presented in Note 11, while 
valuation inputs and techniques are presented in Note 40. The estimates described above are subject to change as new transaction data 
and market evidence become available.
Impairment of insurance premiums receivable
The Group regularly reviews its insurance premiums receivable to assess impairment. For accounting purposes, the Group uses an incurred 
loss model for the recognition of losses on the impaired insurance premiums receivable. This means that losses can only be recognised 
when objective evidence of a specific loss event has been observed. The model for identification of the impaired amounts and their further 
provisioning is mostly based on the number of days in arrears and is very similar to the model used for the analysis and impairment of the 
receivables from healthcare services described above.
For collective assessment purposes management’s judgment is that historical trends can serve as a basis for predicting incurred losses and 
that this approach can be used to estimate the amount of recoverable debts as at the reporting period end. For specific assessment 
purposes the management takes into account financial performance including key ratios and the cash position of the counterparty.
Actual results may differ from the estimates and the Group’s estimates can be revised in the future, either negatively or positively, 
depending upon the outcome or expectations based on the facts surrounding each exposure. The amount of allowance for impairment  
of insurance premiums receivable as at 31 December 2016 was GEL 2,519 (2015: GEL 2,692). Refer to Notes 9 and 34.
Current income tax recognition
The current income tax charge is calculated in accordance with Georgian legislation enacted or substantively enacted by the reporting date. 
Reinvestment of profits in the medical business is free from taxation in accordance with Georgian tax legislation. Judgment is applied to 
assess and determine the portion of the current year profit that the Group will reinvest in its core economical activities during the next 
three years. The probable future reinvestment amount of current year profit is based on the medium-term business plan (three years 
following the current year) prepared by the management. Further details on taxation are disclosed in Note 13.
Claims liability arising from insurance contracts
For insurance contracts, estimates have to be made both for the expected ultimate cost of claims reported at the reporting date and for the 
expected ultimate cost of claims incurred but not yet reported (“IBNR”) at the reporting date. It can take a significant period of time before 
the ultimate claims cost can be established with certainty. Insurance claims provisions are not discounted for the time value of money. The 
carrying amount of the claims incurred but not yet reported as at 31 December 2016 was GEL 1,790 (2015: GEL 1,650). Refer to Note 16.

2 Consideration comprised GEL 30,881, which consists of cash payment of GEL 26,686 and a holdback amount with a fair value of GEL 4,195.
Net cash outflow for the acquisition was as follows:
Cash paid 26,686
Cash acquired with the subsidiary (1,455)
Net cash outflow 25,231
The Group decided to increase its presence and investment in the Tbilisi healthcare market by entering the pharmaceuticals segment 
through the acquisition of GPC. Management considers that the deal will have a positive impact on the value of the Group.
Since acquisition, GPC has recorded GEL 133,002 and GEL 1,924 of revenue and profit, respectively. For the year ended 31 December 2016 
revenue and profit of the acquired entity were GEL 199,916 and GEL 1,705, respectively.
If the combination had taken place at the beginning of the year, the Group would have recorded GEL 490,667 and GEL 61,112 of revenue 
and profit, respectively. 
The primary factor that contributed to the cost of business combination that resulted in the recognition of goodwill on acquisition is the 
positive synergy that is expected to be brought into the Group’s operations. For tax legislation purposes goodwill is recognised on a 
stand-alone balance sheet of a company only subsequent to the legal merger of the relevant cash-generating unit. Until then goodwill as an 
asset does not exist separately for tax purposes, rather its full amount is part of the historical cost of the investment on the company’s 
balance sheet. Subsequent to the merger, for tax legislation purposes, the full amount of the goodwill is recognised as an intangible 
asset per tax code and is subsequently amortised applying the algorithm provided by tax code. Such amortisation is fully deductible for 
tax purposes. 150

6. Segment information
For management purposes, the Group is organised into three operating segments based on the products and services – Healthcare 
services, Pharma and Medical insurance. All revenues, expenses, assets and liabilities of the Group arise in Georgia.
Healthcare services are the inpatient and outpatient medical services delivered by the referral hospitals, community hospitals and ambulatory 
clinics owned by the Group throughout the whole Georgian territory. The Company’s and corporate centre costs are included in the healthcare 
services segment since the segment represents the main driver of the costs from the viewpoint of corporate centre resource consumption. 
Medical insurance comprises a wide range of medical insurance products, including personal accident insurance, term life insurance 
products bundled with medical insurance and travel insurance policies, which are offered by the Group’s wholly owned subsidiary Imedi L.
Pharma comprises a wide range of drugs and parapharmacy products which are offered through a chain of well-developed drug stores by 
the Group’s wholly-owned subsidiary JSC GPC.
Management monitors the operating results of each of the business units separately for the purpose of making decisions about resource 
allocation and performance assessment. Segment performance, as in the table below, is measured in the same manner as profit or loss in 
the consolidated financial statements.
Transactions between operating segments are on an arm’s length basis as with transactions with third parties.
More than 50% of the Group’s revenue is derived from the State. However, management believes that the Government cannot be 
considered as a single client, because the customers of the Group are the patients that receive medical services and not the counterparties 
that pay for these services. Therefore, no revenue from transactions with a single external customer amounted to 10% or more of the 
Group’s total revenue in the year ended 31 December 2016 or 31 December 2015. 158

The Group’s largest receivable is from the State, representing amounts receivable under the Universal Healthcare Programme (“UHC”) 
introduced by the State in March 2013. Through the UHC, the State provides basic healthcare coverage to the entire population, including 
more than two million people who previously lacked any medical insurance and purchased healthcare services only on an out-of-pocket 
basis. Currently fully operational, the implementation of UHC took place in several stages:
• March 2013. Urgent in-patient and limited out-patient healthcare was offered free of charge for individuals who were previously not 
covered by the State or private insurance programmes (accounting for approximately two million people, including children above the 
age of six and adults); 
• July 2013. UHC was extended to cover intensive therapy, planned surgeries, treatment of oncology diseases (including radiotherapy, 
chemotherapy and hormone therapy) as well as childbirth expenses; 
• April 2014. UHC superseded the State Insurance Programme (“SIP”) – the first of two existing State insurance programmes that had 
provided healthcare coverage to “economically vulnerable” citizens since 2007; and
• September 2014. UHC superseded the second SIP (under the Decree Nº165) that covered pensioners, children under six and students.
A summary description of UHC is as follows:
• UHC is fully financed by the Georgian Government and administered by the Social Service Agency. In most cases beneficiaries have an 
annual limit of GEL 15,000 per incident. This threshold limits the services to which a patient can have access, resulting in the need for 
co-payment for most critical elective services; 
• UHC beneficiaries are eligible to select a healthcare provider of their choice, as long as it is enrolled in the programme; 
• any provider, private or public, is eligible to participate in the programme; and
• the actual prices that are charged to patients by healthcare providers are not regulated by the State. However, the reimbursement 
scheme (i.e. the amount paid by the State to healthcare providers) differs depending on the type of services:
 – the capitation method is used for elective outpatient services; 
 – emergency medical care tariffs are based on the minimum historic prices under the previous State medical insurance programmes, 
with the possibility of changes over time; and
 – for elective in-patient services, the amount reimbursed by the State is based on the average of the lowest 25th percentile of the 
prices charged by countrywide providers, with the patient making a co-payment for any excess charges.

11.  Property and equipment continued
During 2016 the Group changed its accounting policy with respect to the hospitals and clinics. The Group engaged an independent appraiser 
to determine the fair value of its land and office buildings and hospitals and clinics on 1 July 2016. As a result, the Group posted a 
revaluation surplus of GEL 20,804 of which GEL 19,645 was attributable to shareholders of the Company and GEL 1,159 was attributable to 
non-controlling interest. Fair value is determined by reference to market-based evidence. The most recent revaluation report for the Group’s 
buildings was dated 1 July 2016. If the land and office buildings and hospitals and clinics were measured using the cost model, the carrying 
amounts of the buildings as at 31 December 2016 and 31 December 2015 would be as follows:

In performing goodwill impairment testing the following key assumptions were made:
• WACC was used as a discount rate for the forecasted cash flows. WACC was estimated using capital assets pricing model based on the 
Group’s shares market beta.
• 2017 , 2018 and 2019 years cash flow projections were modelled applying 10% growth.
• Moderate, stable 4% real GPD growth was assumed based on the external statistical forecasts for 2020 and beyond.
Management believes that reasonably possible changes in key assumptions used to determine the recoverable amount of CGUs will not 
result in an impairment of goodwill. The Group performs goodwill impairment testing annually. The latest impairment test performed by the 
Group was as at 31 December 2016. In 2016 the reporting segments were considered as CGUs for the purposes of goodwill impairment 
testing. The Group did not identify any impairment of goodwill as at 31 December 2016. The recoverable amounts of the cash-generating 
units have been determined based on a value-in-use calculations using cash flow projections based on financial budgets approved by senior 
management covering from a one to three-year period, historical price-to-tangible book value multiple and price earnings ratio multiple.

Deferred tax benefit – origination and reversal of temporary differences 20,004 2,122
Income tax benefit 21,156 9
Georgian legal entities must file individual tax declarations. The statutory corporate tax rate was 15% in years ended 31 December 2016 and 
31 December 2015.
In May 2016, the parliament of Georgia signed a document approving a change in the current corporate taxation model which is applicable 
starting from 1 January 2017 for all entities apart from financial institutions, including insurance business and is applicable starting from 
1 January 2019 to financial institutions, including our medical insurance subsidiary – Imedi L. The new model implies zero rate on retained 
earnings and 15% tax rate on distributed earnings. The Group considers the new regime was substantively enacted in June 2016 and thus 
has re-measured its deferred tax assets and liabilities. The deferred tax assets and liabilities remaining as of 31 December 2016 are 
attributable to only those temporary differences that are expected to be realised or reversed before the new Corporate Income Tax code 
becomes effective for financial institutions (1 January 2019). The change had immediate impact on deferred tax asset and deferred tax 
liability balances. The Group calculated the portion of the deferred tax expected to be utilised before 1 January 2017 for healthcare services 
and pharma subsidiaries and the portion of deferred tax expected to be utilised before 1 January 2019 for medical insurance business and 
fully wrote-off the unutilised portion of deferred tax assets and liabilities.
The effective income tax rate differs from the statutory income tax rates. Reconciliation of the income tax benefit based on statutory rates 
with actual is as follows:

31 December

Non-taxable income 3,195 2,702
Non-deductible expenses (5) (740)
Income tax benefit 21,156 9
Non-taxable income mainly comprises the amount of utilised investment tax credit and other non-taxable corrections. Reinvestment of 
profits in medical business is free from taxation in accordance with Georgian tax legislation. Judgment is applied to assess and determine 
the portion of the current year profit that the Group will reinvest in its core economical activities during the next three years. The probable 
future reinvestment amount of current year profit is based on the medium-term business plan (three years following the current year) 
prepared by the management.
The Group has an unrecognised deferred tax asset as at 31 December 2016 of GEL 587 (2015: GEL 25) originating from tax loss carried 
forward in the Company’s separate accounts. The Group does not expect taxable profits in the Company’s separate accounts for the 
foreseeable future which would enable it to utilise tax loss. Accordingly, in the absence of recognition of a deferred tax asset, there is no 
impact on the financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2016 of the future reductions in the UK corporation tax rate. 164

Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to offset current tax assets against current tax 
liabilities and when the deferred income tax assets and liabilities relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority on either the 
taxable entity or different taxable entities where there is an intention to settle the balances on a net basis. 
Georgia currently has a number of laws related to various taxes imposed by State Governmental authorities. Applicable taxes include value 
added tax, corporate income tax (profits tax) and a turnover based tax, amongst others. Laws related to these taxes have not been in force 
for significant periods in contrast to more developed market economies. Therefore, regulations are often unclear or non-existent and few 
precedents have been established. This creates tax risks in Georgia that are substantially more significant than typically found in countries 
with more developed tax systems. 
Management believes that the Group is in substantial compliance with the tax laws affecting its operations. However, the risk remains that 
relevant authorities could take differing positions with regard to interpretive issues. The Group’s operations and financial position will 
continue to be affected by Georgian political developments, including the application and interpretation of existing and future legislation and 
tax regulations. Such possible occurrences and their effect on the Group could have a material impact on the Group’s operations or its 
financial position in Georgia.

insignificant loss on the transaction. Outstanding balance as of 31 December 2016 equaled GEL 36,024 (2015: GEL 35,537).
20. Payables for share acquisitions
Payables for share acquisitions (also referred to as a “holdback” or an “acquisition holdback”) are stated at fair value and represent 
outstanding amounts payable for business combinations and acquisition of non-controlling interest in existing subsidiaries. Payables for 
business combination is a portion of the total consideration, payment of which is deferred for a specified period of time in the future and, 
usually, is contingent upon certain events or conditions precedent or covenants established by the buyer. These conditions are: (i) the 
audited total equity balance in accordance with IFRS should not be materially different compared to management accounts existing as at 
the date of deal; (ii) material unrecorded liabilities should not be identified; and (iii) any liabilities of the acquiree and/or its related parties 
towards the acquirer should not remain unpaid for greater than predetermined period after acquisition. Once these conditions precedent  
are fulfilled, the holdback amount is then paid fully or adjusted, as prescribed in the share purchase agreement for each particular business 
combination. As at 31 December 2016 payable for share acquisitions comprised a holdback for the acquisition of JSC GPC of GEL 5,210,

23. Commitments and contingencies
Legal
In the ordinary course of business, the Group and the Company are subject to legal actions and complaints. Management believes that the 
ultimate liability, if any, arising from such actions or complaints will not have a material adverse effect on the financial condition or the 
results of future operations of the Group and the Company.
T axation
Georgian tax, currency and customs legislation is subject to varying interpretations, and changes, which can occur frequently. 
Management’s interpretation of such legislation as applied to the transactions and activity of the Group may be challenged by the relevant 
tax authorities. Recent events within Georgia suggest that the tax authorities are taking a more assertive position in their interpretation of 
the legislation and assessments and as a result, it is possible that transactions and activities that have not been challenged in the past may 
be challenged. As such, significant additional taxes, penalties and interest may be assessed. It is not practical to determine the amount of 
unasserted claims that may manifest, if any, or the likelihood of any unfavourable outcome. Fiscal periods remain open to review by the 
authorities in respect of taxes for five calendar years preceding the period of review. Under certain circumstances reviews may cover longer 
periods. Management believes that its interpretation of the relevant legislation is appropriate and that it is probable that the Group’s tax, 
currency and customs positions will be sustained.
Financial commitments and contingencies
The Group’s financial commitments and contingencies comprise the following:
31 December 
2016
31 December 
2015
Capital commitments 12,914 17 ,176

In year ended 31 December 2016 as well as in year ended 31 December 2015 capital commitments comprised of contracts related to 
construction of ambulatory clinics in Georgia. The commitments fully result from subsidiaries. The Company does not have any 
commitments or contingencies. The Group did not have contingent rents or sublease payments. The Company does not have any lease 
commitments. Rent expense recognised during the year equalled GEL 9,382 (2015: GEL 1,672).
As at 31 December 2016 the Group had litigations with the Social Service Agency on aggregate amount of GEL 3,765. The litigations were 
mainly related to procedural violations in medical documentation as well as billing and invoicing process. The Group’s legal department 
identified related risks as possible but not probable. 
24. Equity
In April 2015 the Group obtained a convertible loan from BGEO in the amount of US$12 million (GEL 28,280 as of conversion date). In May 
2015 the loan was converted to 13,446,125 of GHG shares with par value of GEL 1 (par value changed to GBP 0.1 after IPO). The difference 
of GEL 14,834 between the carrying amount of the converted loan and par value of shares issued was recognised within additional 
paid-in capital.
In 2016 and in 2015 the following changes occurred in the amount of authorised shares:

the entire amount outstanding on the share premium account was cancelled and the nominal value of each issued ordinary share in the 
capital of the Company was reduced from 0.1 GBP to 0.01 GBP . The Capital Reduction has created a significant amount of distributable 
reserves for the Company. As at 31 December 2016 the additional paid-in capital included share-based compensation charge, difference 
between treasury shares purchase price and nominal value, expenses charged directly to equity.  168

GEL 2,520. In 2015 the Group identified transaction costs related to IPO of GEL 11,836. These costs have been debited directly to equity 
through additional paid-in capital and mainly comprise London Stock Exchange listing related fees of GEL 602, business travel expenses of 
GEL 430, IPO-related cash bonuses accrued of GEL 200, professional service expenses related to the IPO including audit and consultancy 
expenses as well as investment bankers’ fees of GEL 13,098, representative and other individually immaterial expenses of GEL 291 and the 
tax effect of the IPO transaction costs of GEL 265, deducted from the transaction costs. 
In 2016 GEL 20,804 was recognised in other comprehensive income as a revaluation surplus on hospitals and clinics. From the total 
amount, GEL 19,645 was attributable to shareholders of the Company and GEL 1,159 was attributable to non-controlling interests.
Regulatory capital requirements in Georgia are set by the ISSSG and are applied to Imedi L solely on a stand-alone basis. The ISSSG 
requirement is to maintain a minimum capital of GEL 2,200 (2015: GEL 1,500), of which 80% should be kept in current accounts. A bank 
confirmation letter is submitted to ISSSG on a quarterly basis in order to prove compliance with the above-mentioned regulatory 
requirement. Imedi L regularly and consistently complies with the ISSSG regulatory capital requirement.
In the July-September period of 2016, the Group purchased 227 ,835 Company shares (0.2% of outstanding shares) in the open market for 
cash consideration of GEL 2,310 to satisfy awards of share-based compensation to doctors and middle management. Aggregate nominal 
value of purchased shares comprised GEL 7 . For the purpose of calculating basic earnings per share the Group used profit for the year and 
total comprehensive income for the year attributable to shareholders of the Company of GEL 50,201 (2015: GEL 19,651) and GEL 69,848 
(2015: GEL 19,651) respectively as a numerator and the weighted average number of shares outstanding during the year ended 
31 December 2016 of 128,067 ,903 (2015: 128,181,820) as a denominator. For diluted earnings per share, the Group used same numerator 
as for basic earnings per share and used the weighted average number of shares outstanding together with number of shares granted to 
management during the year ended 31 December 2016 of 131,681,820 (2015: 131,681,820) as a denominator.
Nature and purpose of other reserves
Revaluation reserve for property and equipment
The revaluation reserve for property and equipment is used to record increases in the fair value of office buildings and hospitals and clinics 
and decreases to the extent that such decrease relates to an increase on the same asset previously recognised in equity. As at 
31 December 2016 the revaluation reserve for property and equipment equalled GEL 20,104 (2015: GEL 459).
Gains (losses) from sale/acquisition of shares in existing subsidiaries
In March 2016, the Group acquired the remaining 33.3% minority shareholding of its largest pediatric hospital, Iashvili Referral Hospital. The 
Group has held a 66.7% controlling interest in Iashvili since February 2014. In exchange for the 33.3% minority shareholding in Iashvili, GHG 
paid cash consideration of US$1 .0 million and transferred non-cash consideration – all of its fixed assets in Tbilisi Maternity Hospital “New 
Life” – to the seller of the minority stake. The resulting gain from the acquisition was GEL 467 .
In February 2015 JSC Georgia Healthcare Group acquired an additional 25% stake in LLC Children New Clinic, an existing subsidiary of 
which the Group previously owned a 75% stake. The acquisition of additional interests in existing subsidiaries in the year ended 
31 December 2015 derives from this transaction. The consideration paid by the Group comprised GEL 2,011 for the purchase of the 
non-controlling interest of GEL 3,265. The resulting gain GEL 1,254 is recorded directly in equity.
As at 31 December 2016 losses from sale/acquisition of shares in existing subsidiaries equalled GEL 15,282 (2015: GEL 15,748).

37 . Share-based compensation
Sanne Fiduciary Services (the “Trustee”) acts as the trustee of the Group’s Employee Benefit Trust (“EBT”), which was founded in 2015. The 
EBT was established for the purposes of satisfying deferred share compensation awarded to Executive Directors and other members of 
executive and senior management.
Due to the fact that the Group does not expect payments of any dividends in subsequent years, they were not incorporated into the 
measurement of fair value of the plans. 
GHG Plans
In February 2016 the Board of Directors of GHG resolved to award 237 ,500 ordinary shares of GHG to the CEO of the Group. In February 
2016 the Board of Directors of GHG resolved to award 281,000 ordinary shares of GHG to three executives. The shares were awarded with 
a three-year vesting period, with continuous employment being the only vesting condition for both awards. The Group considers 15 February 
2016 as the grant date for the awards to the CEO and other executives. The Group estimates that the fair value of the shares awarded was 
GEL 6.28 per share as of grant date. The fair values were identified based on market prices on grant date. As at 31 December 2016, no 
shares have been vested.
In January 2015 the CEO of the Group and the deputies signed five-year fixed contingent share-based compensation agreements for the 
total of 1,670,000 ordinary shares of GHG. The total amount of shares fixed to each executive will be awarded in five equal instalments 
during the five consecutive years starting January 2017 , of which each award will be subject to a four-year vesting period with 20% of shares 
vesting during the first three years and 40% of shares vesting during the fourth year. The Group considers 1 January 2015 and 29 April 2015 
as the grant dates for the awards to the CEO and deputies respectively. The Group estimates that the fair value of the shares awarded was 
GEL 2.18 per share as of the respective grant dates. The respective fair values were estimated using appropriate valuation techniques based 
on market and income approaches. As at 31 December 2016, no shares have been vested.
BGEO Plans
In March 2015 the Board of Directors of BGEO resolved to award 24,576 ordinary shares of BGEO to four executives of the Group. The 
shares were awarded with a three-year vesting period, with continuous employment being the only vesting condition for the awards. The 
Group considers 19 March 2015 as the grant date for the awards. The Group estimates that the fair value of the shares awarded on 
19 March 2015 was GEL 57 .41 per share. The fair value was identified based on market prices on grant date. As at 31 December 2016, 
one-third of the awarded shares have vested.

38. Capital management 
Capital under management consists of share capital, additional paid-in capital, retained earnings including profit or loss of the current year, 
revaluation and other reserves and non-controlling interests. The Group has established the following capital management objectives, 
policies and approach to managing the risks that affect its capital position.
The capital management objectives are as follows:
• to maintain the required level of stability of the Group thereby providing a degree of security to the shareholders as well as insurance 
policyholders of the insurance arm;
• to allocate capital efficiently and support the development of business by ensuring that returns on capital employed meet the 
requirements of its capital providers and of its shareholders; and
• to maintain financial strength to support new business growth and to satisfy the requirements of the shareholders, regulators as well as 
insurance policyholders for the insurance arm.
Some operations of the Group are subject to local regulatory requirements within the jurisdiction where it operates, currently Georgia only. 
Such regulations prescribe approval and monitoring of certain activities. They also impose certain restrictive provisions for the insurance 
arm, such as insurance capital adequacy and the minimal insurance liquidity requirement, to minimise the risk of default and insolvency and 
to meet unforeseen liabilities as they arise.
During the year ended 31 December 2016 and year ended 31 December 2015 the Group complied with all of regulatory requirements as 
well as insurance capital and insurance liquidity regulations, in full.
The Group’s capital management policy for its insurance business is to hold the least required amount of the regulatory capital and, also, to 
hold sufficient liquid assets to cover statutory requirements based on the directives of ISSSG. Regulations of ISSSG require that an 
insurance company must hold liquid assets of at least 75% of its unearned premium reserve, net of gross insurance premiums receivable, 
and 100% of its loss reserves. Assets eligible for inclusion in liquid assets are: cash and cash equivalents, amounts due from credit 
institutions, loans issued, investment property as well as other financial assets, as defined by ISSSG. The amount of such minimal liquid 
assets is called the “Statutory Reserve” . 
The Statutory Reserve requirement for Imedi L as at 31 December 2016 equals the minimal amount of liquid assets of GEL 7 ,007 
(2015: GEL 9,565). The insurance company is fully compliant with the requirement by holding GEL 9,693 (2015: GEL 10,607) of total 
eligible liquid assets.
39. Risk management
Introduction
Risk is inherent in the Group’s activities but it is managed through a process of ongoing identification, measurement and monitoring, 
subject to risk limits and other controls. This process of risk management is critical to the Group’s continuing profitability and each individual 
within the Group is accountable for the risk exposures relating to his or her responsibilities. The Group is exposed to insurance risk, credit 
risk, liquidity risk and market risk. It is also subject to operational risks. 
The independent risk control process does not include business risks such as changes in the environment, technology and industry. They 
are monitored through the Group’s strategic planning process. 
Risk management structure
Board of Directors
During 2016 and 2015 years the Board of Directors of the Group had the responsibility to monitor and manage the risk process within the 
respective GHG components on a regular basis, by assigning tasks, creating different executive committees, designing and setting up risk 
management policies and procedures as well as respective guidelines and controlling their implementation and performance of relevant 
departments and committees. 
Audit Committee
The Audit Committee has overall responsibility for implementing principles, frameworks, policies and limits in accordance with the Group’s 
risk management strategy related to the general control environment, manual and application controls, risks of intentional or unintentional 
misstatements, risk of fraud or misappropriation of assets, information security, information technology risks, etc. The Audit Committee 
facilitates the activities of the internal audit and external auditors of the Group. The Audit Committee is elected and directly monitored by 
the independent members of the Board.
Risk measurement and reporting systems
The Group’s risks are measured using a method which reflects both the expected loss likely to arise in normal circumstances and 
unexpected losses, which are an estimate of the ultimate actual loss based on different forecasting models. The models make use of 
probabilities derived from historical experience, adjusted to reflect the economic environment. The Group runs three different basic 
scenarios, of which one is the Base Case (forecast under normal business conditions) and the other two are the Troubled and Distressed 
Scenarios, which are worse and the worst-case scenarios, respectively, that would arise in the event that extreme events that are unlikely 
to occur do, in fact, occur. 174

39. Risk management continued
Monitoring and controlling risks is primarily performed based on limits established by the Group. These limits reflect the business strategy 
and market environment of the Group as well as the level of risk that the Group is willing to accept, with additional emphasis on selected 
industries. In addition, the Group monitors and measures the overall risk bearing capacity in relation to the aggregate risk exposure across 
all risks types and activities.
Information compiled from all the businesses is examined and processed in order to analyse, control and identify early risks. This 
information is presented and explained to the Management Board and the head of each business division. The reports include aggregate 
receivables exposures and credit exposures, their limits, exceptions to those limits, insurance contract liability positions and their limits, 
liquidity ratios and liquidity limits, market risk ratios and their limits, and changes to the risk profile. Senior management assesses the 
appropriateness of the levels of liquidity, credit positions, receivables positions and allowance for impairment on a monthly basis. The 
Management Board receives a comprehensive risk report once a month. These reports are designed to provide all the necessary 
information to assess and conclude on the risks of the Group. 
Risk mitigation
As part of its overall risk management, the Group uses derivatives and other instruments to manage exposures to net currency position, 
insurance liabilities risks, interest rates and credit risks. 
The Group actively uses a collective financial responsibility approach to individual healthcare customers arising from the provision of 
healthcare services to out-of-pocket customers, to manage the respective individual debtors arising from healthcare services falling out of 
the scope of the UHC. 
Insurance risk
The risk under an insurance contract is the risk that an insured event will occur including the uncertainty of the amount and timing of any 
resulting claim. The principal risk the Group faces under such contracts is that actual claims and benefit payments exceed the carrying 
amount of insurance liabilities. This is influenced by the frequency of claims, severity of claims, actual benefits paid that are greater than 
originally estimated and subsequent development of long term claims.
The Group primarily uses its loss ratio and its combined ratio to monitor its insurance risk. Loss ratio is defined as net insurance claims 
divided by net insurance revenue. Combined ratio is sum of loss ratio and expense ratio. Expense ratio is defined as insurance related 
operating expenses excluding interest expense divided by net insurance revenue. The Group’s loss ratios and combined ratios were 
as follows: 
31 December 
2016
31 December 
2015
Loss ratio 84.1% 83.4%
Combined ratio 104.7% 96.7%
The Group issues the following types of insurance contracts: health, term life bundled with health, personal accident and travel insurance. 
The table below sets out concentration of insurance contract liabilities by type of contract: 
Y ear ended 
31 December 
2016
Year ended 
31 December 
2015
Healthcare 3,556 2,412
Term life 667 721
Travel 144 222
Personal accident 48 11
T otal 4,415 3,366
For these insurance contracts the most significant risks arise from lifestyle changes, epidemic as well as changes in loss frequency and 
increases in prices of medical services. These risks vary significantly in relation to the location of the risk insured by the Group and the type 
of risks insured.
The above risk exposure is mitigated by diversification across a large portfolio of insurance contracts. The variability of risks is also improved 
by careful selection and implementation of underwriting strategies. The Group establishes underwriting guidelines and limits that stipulate 
who may accept risks, their nature and applicable limits. These limits are continuously monitored. Strict claim review policies to assess all 
new and ongoing claims, as well as the investigation of possible fraudulent claims are in place. The Group also enforces a policy of actively 
managing and promptly processing claims, in order to reduce its exposure to unpredictable future developments that can negatively impact 
the Group. 
Loss development triangle
Reproduced below is a table that shows the development of claims over a period of time. The table shows reserves for both, claims 
reported as well as claims incurred but not yet reported, and cumulative payments. Claims estimates are translated into GEL at the rate of

Credit risk
Credit risk is the risk that the Group will incur a loss because its customers, clients or counterparties fail to discharge their contractual 
obligations. The Group manages and controls credit risk by setting limits on the amount of risk it is willing to accept for individual 
counterparties and for product and currency concentrations, and by monitoring exposures in relation to such limits. Also, the Group 
establishes and regularly monitors credit terms by types of debtors, which is a proactive tool for managing the credit risk. 
The Group has established a credit quality review process to provide early identification of possible changes in the creditworthiness of 
counterparties, including regular analysis of debt service and ageing of receivables. Counterparty limits are established in combination with 
credit terms. The credit quality review process allows the Group to assess the potential loss as a result of the risks to which it is exposed 
and take corrective action.
Credit quality per class of financial assets
The credit quality of financial assets is managed by the Group based on number of overdue days. The table below shows maximum 
exposure to credit risk and credit quality by class of asset in the statement of financial position.

Liquidity risk and funding management
Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group will be unable to meet all its payment obligations when they fall due under normal or stress 
circumstances. To limit this risk, management has arranged diversified funding sources in addition to its capital, manages assets with 
liquidity in mind, and monitors future cash flows and liquidity on a regular basis. This incorporates daily monitoring of expected cash flows 
and liquidity needs. 
The Group manages the maturities of its assets and liabilities for better matching, which helps the Group additionally mitigate the liquidity 
risk. The major liquidity risks confronting the Group are the daily calls on its available cash resources in respect of supplier contracts, claims 
arising from insurance contracts and the maturity of borrowings.
The table below analyses assets and liabilities of the Group into their relevant maturity groups based on the remaining period at the 
reporting date to their contractual maturities or expected repayment dates.

Market risk
Market risk is the risk that the value of financial instruments will fluctuate due to changes in market variables such as interest rates and 
foreign exchange rates.
The Group has exposure to market risks. The Group structures the levels of market risk it accepts through a Group market risk policy that 
determines what constitutes market risk for the Group.
Interest rate risk
Interest rate risk arises from the possibility that changes in interest rates will affect the fair value of the financial instruments or the future 
cash flows on financial instruments. The Group has floating interest rate borrowings linked to LIBOR and NBG short-term loan refinancing 
rates and is therefore exposed to interest rate risk.

Currency risk
The Group is exposed to the effects of fluctuations in the prevailing foreign currency exchange rates on its financial position and cash flows. 
The Group’s principal transactions are carried out in Georgian Lari and its exposure to foreign exchange risk arises primarily with respect to 
Dollar.
The Group’s financial assets are primarily denominated in the same currencies as its liabilities, which is the functional currency of the Group 
entities – Lari. Most of the Group’s operations are denominated in Lari too. This fact mitigates the foreign currency exchange rate risk 
operationally. The main foreign exchange risk arises from Dollars denominated borrowings that are partially hedged through cash deposits 
with banks, also denominated in Dollars and the foreign currency forward contracts with the Group’s counterparties. The Group also hedges 
currency risk component of two of its fixed assets that are intended for disposal through foreign exchange denominated borrowings (Note 
3). The hedge was fully effective in 2016. The gross value of foreign exchange fluctuation (gain) hedged equalled GEL 1,986 on both hedged 
items and hedging instrument.

The tables below indicate the currencies to which the Group had significant exposure at 31 December 2016 and 31 December 2015 on its 
monetary assets and liabilities. The analysis calculates the effect of a reasonably possible movement of the currency rate against the 
Georgian Lari, with all other variables held constant on the profit or loss. A negative amount in the table reflects a potential net reduction  
in profit or loss, while a positive amount reflects a net potential increase.

39. Risk management continued
Operational risk
Operational risk is the risk of loss arising from systems failure, human error, fraud or external events. When controls fail to operate 
effectively, operational risks can cause damage to reputation, have legal or regulatory implications, or lead to financial loss. The Group 
cannot expect to eliminate all operational risks, but through a control framework and by monitoring and responding to potential risks, the 
Group is able to manage the risks. Controls include effective segregation of duties, access, authorisation and reconciliation procedures, 
staff education and assessment processes, including the use of internal audit. 
Operating environment
The Group’s business is concentrated in Georgia. As an emerging market, Georgia does not possess a well-developed business and 
regulatory infrastructure that would generally exist in a more mature market economy. Operations in Georgia may involve risks that are not 
typically associated with those in developed markets (including the risk that the Georgian Lari is not freely convertible outside the country, 
and undeveloped debt and equity markets). However, over the last few years the Georgian Government has made a number of 
developments that positively affect the overall investment climate of the country, specifically implementing the reforms necessary to create 
banking, judicial, taxation and regulatory systems. This includes the adoption of a new body of legislation (including new Tax Code and 
procedural laws). In the view of the Board, these steps contribute to mitigate the risks of doing business in Georgia. 
The existing tendency aimed at the overall improvement of the business environment is expected to persist. The future stability of the 
Georgian economy is largely dependent upon these reforms and developments and the effectiveness of economic, financial and monetary 
measures undertaken by the Government. However, the Georgian economy is vulnerable to market downturns and economic slowdowns 
elsewhere in the world. 
40. Fair value measurements
Fair value hierarchy
For the purpose of fair value disclosures, the Group has determined classes of assets and liabilities on the basis of the nature, 
characteristics and risks of the asset or liability. The Group uses the following hierarchy for determining and disclosing the fair value: 
• Level 1: quoted (unadjusted) prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities;
• Level 2: techniques for which all inputs which have a significant effect on the recorded fair value are observable, either directly or 
indirectly; and
• Level 3: techniques which use inputs which have a significant effect on the recorded fair value that are not based on observable 
market data.
The following tables show analysis of assets and liabilities measured at fair value or for which fair values are disclosed by level of the fair 
value hierarchy. They also include a comparison by class of the carrying amounts and fair values of the Group’s financial instruments that are 
carried in the financial statements. The tables do not include the fair values of non-financial assets and non-financial liabilities:

The Group carries land and office buildings and hospitals and clinics at fair value (level 3). Reconciliation between opening and closing 
balances is presented in Note 11 . 
The following is a description of the determination of fair value for financial instruments and property that are recorded at fair value 
using valuation techniques. These incorporate the Group’s estimate of assumptions that a market participant would make when valuing 
the instruments.
Property and equipment
Property carried at fair value consists of land and buildings and hospitals and clinics, for which fair value is derived by certain inputs that are 
not based on observable market data. The value of these assets is measured using the market approach. The market approach uses prices 
and other relevant information generated by market transactions involving identical or comparable land and buildings respectively. 
Derivative financial instruments 
Derivative financial instruments valued using a valuation technique with market observable inputs comprise forward foreign exchange 
contracts. The applied valuation technique represents forward pricing model using present value calculations. The model incorporates 
various inputs including the foreign exchange spot and forward rates.

The following describes the methodologies and assumptions used to determine fair values for those financial instruments that are not 
already recorded at fair value in the consolidated financial statements.
Assets for which fair value approximates carrying value
For financial assets and financial liabilities that are liquid or have a short-term maturity (less than three months) as well as for all short-term 
State receivables it is assumed that the carrying amounts approximate their fair value. This assumption is also applied to variable rate 
financial instruments.
Fixed rate financial instruments
The fair value of fixed rate financial assets and liabilities carried at amortised cost is estimated by comparing market interest rates when 
they were first recognised with current market rates offered for similar financial instruments. The estimated fair value of fixed interest 
bearing deposits is based on a discounted cash flow analysis using prevailing money-market interest rates for debts with similar credit risk 
and maturity. 182

42. Events after reporting period
IFRS 15 adoption 
On 1 January 2017 the Group adopted IFRS 15 applying the modified retrospective application method. For details refer to Note 3.
JSC ABC Pharmacy acquisition
On 6 January 2017 the Group acquired 67% of the shares of JSC ABC Pharmacy (“ ABC”), a pharmaceuticals company operating in Georgia 
from individual investors. As a result of acquisition, the Group increased its presence and investment in the Georgian healthcare market. 
Management considers that the deal will have a positive impact on the value of the Group. Subsequent to acquisition, GHG will merge ABC 
with GPC, the existing pharmaceuticals subsidiary of the Group, and the name of the merged company will be JSC Georgian Pharmacy 
(“GEPHA ”).
Consideration comprised cash payment of GEL 32,554, a holdback amount with a fair value of GEL 30,041 (payable in five tranches over the 
five-year period) and non-cash consideration comprising 33% shares in GPC. In accordance with the terms of the deal, the selling 
shareholders are required to invest 33% of cash proceeds from sale of ABC in GHG shares that will be locked up during the 3 years 
following the purchase. In addition, the Group and the selling shareholders entered in a call and put options over remaining 33% minority 
stake in the combined pharma business. Upon exercise of either option, 33% of the cash proceeds received by the selling shareholders will 
be used to purchase GHG shares, with a lock-up that expires annually in a straight line over two years.
Provisionally estimated unaudited net assets of ABC at acquisition date comprised GEL 39,937 . The goodwill is expected to arise from the 
acquisition consisting largely of the synergy that is expected to be brought into the Group’s operations. The Group continues a thorough 
examination of the net assets and if identified, adjustments will be made to the net assets and amount of the goodwill and accounting for 
business combination will be complete during the 12-month period from the acquisition date, as allowed by IFRS 3 ‘Business 
Combinations’. 184

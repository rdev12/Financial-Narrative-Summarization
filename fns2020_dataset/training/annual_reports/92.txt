UBC MEDIA GROUP PLC
CHAIRMAN’S STATEMENT
John Hodson Chairman
This is the ﬁrst opportunity I have had to write to the shareholders of 
UBC Media Group since my appointment as Chairman of the Company in 
February 2005.
As the new Chairman I think it is helpful to reiterate the strategy that has 
guided the Group’s development since its ﬂotation in July 2000. This has been 
to maximise the returns from UBC’s traditional businesses as a means to ﬁnance 
the Group’s digital expansion, including the signiﬁcant programme of investment 
in its portfolio of digital assets.
In keeping with UBC’s strategy, I am delighted to report another year of strong 
turnover growth for the Group. Turnover grew by 20% to £15.96 million (2004: 
£13.29 million). Operating Proﬁts for the Group increased to £1,075,000 (2004: 
£405,000) before goodwill of £704,000 and digital licences of £1.50 million. 
The growth in the past year reﬂects a combination of both organic growth and 
acquisitions, with positive contributions from all the Group’s main divisions.  
Full details of the performance of each of the Group’s divisions are contained in 
the Financial Review.
I would like to take this opportunity to extend the thanks of the board to my 
predecessor, Michael Peacock, who performed the role of chairman of UBC with 
great skill since the Company was founded in 1989. Michael’s contribution to the 
business has been enormous, bringing to UBC all the experience gained from a 
long and distinguished career in the media industry. On behalf of my colleagues 
I would like to express my appreciation to Michael for all he has done to guide 
UBC to where it is today and to wish him a long and well deserved retirement.
Following his decision to stand down as a director, I would also like to thank 
Keith Harris on behalf of the rest of the Board for his long standing contribution 
to the Company, and most recently for his services as a director of UBC.
The commercial and creative successes of the past year could not have been 
achieved without the enthusiasm and commitment of the whole team at UBC. 
The Company has a highly talented workforce and it is their consistent and 
focused efforts that have enabled us to deliver a further year of strong growth.
UBC is founded on a culture of innovation and creativity and the strong 
performance of the past year is evidence of the robust and complementary mix of 
businesses within the Group. The Company is led by an established management 
team that is young and energetic, and with ambitions to grow the business 
substantially over the next few years. I believe that with a continuing favourable 
environment the prospects for the Company in the current year are good.
 
John Hodson 
Chairman I am pleased to be able to report a further year of strong growth for UBC 
Media Group, delivering on our past commitment to shareholders and 
putting in place a robust foundation for the next stage in the development 
of your company.
Digital radio is now a success story, with the UK leading the world. Key skills for 
exploiting the digital marketplace are the supply of content, control of spectrum 
and software development. UBC is well placed in each of these areas, with skills 
and experience, as is evident from a number of developments during the last 
year, both in the UK and overseas.
The high growth digital radio environment that we anticipated and around which 
we have built UBC is now upon us. DAB is proving to be one of the fastest ever 
new technologies to reach mass market status and the industry’s forecasts 
for take-up this year are currently being revised upwards. UBC has sought to 
create the right business mix for an environment that we believe will operate on 
different economic models from that of the traditional analogue radio world.
The creation of strong brands is of growing importance in what is an increasingly 
competitive marketplace. In this respect, our partnership with Channel 4 
Television in our national digital radio station, Oneword Radio, is of particular 
signiﬁcance, and also demonstrates the increasing value of ownership of digital 
radio licences.
As we predicted, networking and the ability to generate revenues by providing 
programming to stations owned by others is becoming a key part of the digital 
radio economy. It is in this area that we have seen particularly strong growth in 
the past year. Our syndicated programmes now reach 34% of the UK population 
every day and revenues grew 44.1% in the year. The acquisition of the leading 
regional independent production company, Smooth Operations, has made an 
important contribution to a 34.4% growth in revenues from commissioned 
programming. We continue to be one of the leading suppliers of programmes 
to the BBC and the value of this position is ampliﬁed by the BBC’s intention to 
double the programming it commissions from independent production companies. 
Whilst we welcome a step that will beneﬁt our production businesses, it will 
still leave radio outsourcing signiﬁcantly behind that of television. We see no

justiﬁcation for this, and are lobbying government as part of the current Charter 
Review process to encourage greater movement from the BBC.
Digital radio offers the opportunity to bring real vision to the radio industry. UBC 
Media Group’s strategy has been to anticipate how digital radio will develop, 
and position the Company to beneﬁt from new opportunities as they emerge. 
We believe the ability to transmit data will be one of the key drivers of the 
next stage in the development of DAB digital radio. We already have a 40% UK 
market share for the provision of software to drive the existing text services that 
accompany digital radio broadcasts. This, however, is only the beginning: devices 
are now being launched which allow full Electronic Programme Guides (EPG) and 
facilitate sophisticated services using digital radio’s data capacity. 
UBC has the only commercially available EPG software in the UK and has already 
licensed this to major UK broadcasters, including GCap Media and the recently 
announced BT Livetime datacasting venture. A major part of our investment in 
2006 will focus on exploring ways to exploit the data capacity that is owned by 
UBC and, in particular, on the launch of innovative services that allow music to  
be downloaded over digital radio. We expect to launch such a service in the 
next calendar year.
UBC’s aim continues to be to grow the business both organically and by 
acquisition. We remain committed to investing in the development of 
our portfolio of digital assets and to maintaining our position at the 
forefront of innovation and technical achievement. Since the start of 
the new ﬁnancial year, as has been widely reported elsewhere, the 
radio advertising market has shown signs of softening. However, 
we continue to see advertising revenues higher than at this 
time last year. The Group continues to perform in line with 
expectations and we believe the prospects for the year 
ahead are positive.

UBC IS THE LARGEST INDEPENDENT RADIO PRODUCTION  
COMPANY IN THE UK. IN 2005 UBC’S PRODUCTION BUSINESSES,  
UNIQUE AND SMOOTH OPERATIONS, PRODUCED OVER 600 HOURS  
OF COMMISSIONED PROGRAMMING FOR THE BBC.
IN AUGUST 2004 UBC ACQUIRED SMOOTH OPERATIONS, THE UK’S LEADING 
REGIONAL INDEPENDENT PRODUCTION COMPANY. THE INTEGRATION OF 
SMOOTH OPERATIONS HAS PROGRESSED WELL AND IN THE LAST YEAR THE 
GROUP HAS SEEN STRONG GROWTH IN REVENUES FROM COMMISSIONED 
PROGRAMMING TO THE BBC. UBC IS WELL POSITIONED TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF 
THE BBC’S PLANS TO INCREASE BOTH ITS REGIONAL OUTPUT AND THE AMOUNT 
OF INDEPENDENTLY PRODUCED PROGRAMMING IT BROADCASTS.  UBC RANKS AS ONE OF THE LARGEST SUPPLIERS OF SYNDICATED 
PROGRAMMES TO COMMERCIAL RADIO – SUPPLYING BOTH THE 
NETWORK DRIVE AND ENTERTAINMENT NEWS SERVICES.
IN 2005 UBC’S SYNDICATED AIRTIME SALES BUSINESS DELIVERED 
STRONG GROWTH AS A RESULT OF COMBINING UBC’S AND EMAP’S 
SYNDICATED RADIO AIRTIME SALES NETWORKS AND THE LAUNCH OF A 
CONSOLIDATED TRAFFIC AND TRAVEL SERVICE. THE MARKET FOR UBC’S 
SYNDICATED RADIO PROGRAMMING CONTINUES TO BE STRONG AS THE 
COMMERCIAL RADIO SECTOR INCREASINGLY RECOGNISES ITS NEED TO 
INVEST IN HIGH–QUALITY PROGRAMMING.
6  CLASSIC GOLD DIGITAL AND ONEWORD RADIO ARE  
PRIME ASSETS IN DIGITAL RADIO.
CLASSIC GOLD DIGITAL RANKS AS ONE OF THE TOP ‘GOLD’ 
FORMATS IN THE UK, AND IS BROADCAST ON BOTH ANALOGUE 
AND DIGITAL PLATFORMS, REACHING A POTENTIAL UK ADULT 
AUDIENCE OF 29 MILLION. ONEWORD RADIO OWNS THE UK’S 
ONLY COMMERCIAL DIGITAL SPOKEN–WORD LICENCE. WE 
BELIEVE THAT CHANNEL 4’S TIE-UP WITH UBC IN THE JOINT 
OWNERSHIP OF ONEWORD RADIO IS A KEY DEVELOPMENT IN 
THE GROWTH OF DIGITAL RADIO IN THE UK.
8  THE LAUNCH OF A NEW GENERATION OF DIGITAL RADIO  
SERVICES WILL FUNDAMENTALLY CHANGE THE DEVELOPMENT  
OF DIGITAL RADIO.
UBC EXPECTS THE NEXT FEW YEARS WILL SEE THE LAUNCH OF A NEW 
GENERATION OF RADIO RECEIVERS CAPABLE OF DELIVERING SERVICES 
NEVER BEFORE AVAILABLE ON RADIO. THE LAUNCH IN 2005 OF THE FIRST 
EPG–ENABLED DEVICES WILL BE FOLLOWED BY THE LAUNCH OF NEW  
RADIO SERVICES, SUCH AS MUSIC DOWNLOADING. UBC’S OWNERSHIP  
OF DATA SPECTRUM AND EXPERIENCE IN RADIO SOFTWARE SERVICES 
PLACES THE GROUP AT THE FOREFRONT OF THIS MARKET.

Financial performance by division
PRODUCTION
UBC’s Production Division encompasses both the Group’s commissioned 
radio programming for the BBC and syndicated programming for the 
commercial radio industry.
Commissioned Programming 
 2005 2004  
 £m £m % Change
Turnover 2.93 2.18 +34.4
 
UBC’s commissioned programming business for the BBC comprises the 
Group’s historic production business, Unique, and the leading regional 
independent production company, Smooth Operations, which UBC 
acquired in August 2004.
The integration of Smooth Operations, which operates from ofﬁces in 
Manchester and Cambridge, has progressed well and Unique continues 
to recover from the expiry of one of its long-standing commissions 
at the start of the ﬁnancial year. Turnover for the year was ahead by 
34.4% at £2.93 million (2004: £2.18 million), and includes an 8 months’ 
contribution from Smooth Operations of turnover of £1.14 million.
Unique and Smooth Operations produce a wide range of programmes 
for broadcast across the BBC’s network of national analogue and digital 
stations. Unique and Smooth Operations produce more than 600 hours of 
programming for the BBC per year across a number of genres, with much 
of their output as long-term commissions for some of the BBC’s ﬂagship 
radio programmes. As an indication of the creative skills within the 
Group, this year UBC received a record number of Sony Radio Academy 
nominations for its programmes, including winning two prestigious Sony 
Radio Academy Gold Awards.
The acquisition of Smooth Operations, which specialises in the Folk 
and Country music genres, was an important strategic move by UBC in 
a sector that it knows well and where prospects for signiﬁcant organic 
growth have historically been limited. The strategic importance of 
the acquisition of Smooth Operations was underlined by the BBC’s 
announcement in December 2004 of its intention to invest signiﬁcantly 
in production resources in Manchester. In addition, UBC believes both 
Unique and Smooth Operations are well positioned to beneﬁt from  
the BBC’s announcement during the year that it intends to double 
the number of hours allocated to independent radio production by its 
national radio networks.

ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2005
Syndicated Programming 
 2005 2004  
 £m £m % Change
Turnover 7.55 5.24 +44.1
 
UBC operates two networks of syndicated programmes, Entertainment 
News and the Network Drive trafﬁc & travel service, both of which UBC 
supplies free of charge to radio stations across the UK while retaining 
airtime within each bulletin which is then available to UBC to sell to 
national advertisers.
Revenues from UBC’s airtime sales business were up 44.1% in the year 
to £7.55 million (2004: £5.24 million). The strong performance by the 
airtime sales business followed a doubling of revenues from syndicated 
programming in the year to 31 March 2004.
The signiﬁcant increase in airtime sales revenues in the year reﬂects 
in particular the substantial growth of the trafﬁc & travel news service 
in the ﬁrst-half of the ﬁnancial year. In July 2004 Emap and UBC 
consolidated their competing trafﬁc & travel services into a combined 
package encompassing over 174 commercial radio stations to be sold 
by UBC. The network was relaunched in August as one of the largest 
syndicated packages in the UK, delivering a weekly reach of over 15.1 
million adults and over 141 million adult impacts. The consolidation of 
competing airtime packages was followed in September 2004 by UBC’s 
appointment of Trafﬁclink as sole supplier of trafﬁc and travel data to  
the Network Drive service.
We believe that in the future syndicated programming will become an 
increasingly important feature of the commercial radio market. The 
growth in digital radio will result in there being more radio stations in 
each market, and in response to market fragmentation advertisers will 
seek advertising properties that deliver national reach. One of the main 
challenges facing radio groups in this changed environment will be how 
to provide cost effective, high-quality programming, and in particular 
programming which can compete against the BBC’s output. UBC believes 
that networked programming is likely to form an important part of the 
solution to these competitive challenges.
As a consequence, UBC is continuing to explore ways in which to grow 
its syndicated programming business. In September 2004 UBC acquired 
a 12.5% shareholding in Popworld Limited, which owns and controls 
Channel 4’s ﬂagship music-based programme of the same name and 
which is also broadcast on MTV. As part of its investment UBC became 
Popworld’s radio partner with exclusive responsibility for exploitation 
of the Popworld brand through networked programming to commercial 
radio stations.
RADIO STATIONS
UBC’s two main radio stations are Classic Gold Digital, which broadcasts 
a Classic Hits format on a network of analogue and digital platforms 
across the UK, and the national, digital spoken-word radio station, 
Oneword Radio.
Classic Gold Digital 
 2005 2004  
 £m £m % Change
Turnover 4.41 4.69 –6.0
 
Classic Gold Digital Limited performed in line with expectations in the 
year to 31 March 2005, with revenues down 6% on the previous year,  
at £4.41 million (2004: £4.69 million).
Classic Gold Digital’s revenues are directly based upon the network’s 
audience as measured by RAJAR, in the form of an audience fee that 
GCap Media pays to Classic Gold Digital in return for it selling airtime 
on the network. The RAJAR results during the year for Classic Gold 
Digital have shown a modest decline in audiences. Overall, the long-
term decline in audiences common to radio services broadcast on AM 
frequencies has been partially compensated for by growth in digital 
audiences. As part of its long-term strategy to maintain audiences, 
Classic Gold Digital has continued to invest throughout the year in high 
quality programming output and marketing. 
The RAJAR report for the ﬁnal quarter of the ﬁnancial year ended  
31 March 2005 shows that 30% of Classic Gold Digital’s listeners are 
listening to the station on digital, up from 25% in the preceding quarter. 
In addition, the number of listeners in areas where Classic Gold Digital  
is only available digitally has increased by 7%. With the increasing 
growth of digital listening, one of the key challenges facing the radio 
industry in the forthcoming year will be educating advertisers to place 
equal value on both analogue and digital listening.
GCap Media holds an option that it may exercise from October 2005 
to increase its shareholding in Classic Gold Digital from its current 
20% to 75%. The price GCap Media is required to pay UBC to increase 
its shareholding in Classic Gold Digital is based on a formula agreed 
in October 2000. UBC has currently received no indication from GCap 
Media of any plans to increase its shareholding in Classic Gold Digital.
Oneword Radio 
The past year was a transitional period for Oneword Radio. In June 2004 
UBC increased its shareholding in Oneword Radio to 100% as a means 
of ensuring the long-term future of the station. As a consequence of 
taking full control of Oneword Radio, the results of UBC for the year to 
31 March 2005 include a period of 9 months when Oneword Radio was 
treated as a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company. 14
UBC MEDIA GROUP PLC
As a result of a restructuring programme that took place at the same 
time that UBC acquired full control of Oneword Radio, the cost of 
operating Oneword Radio was closely controlled throughout the year. 
At the same time it has shown steady audience growth year-on-year, 
with audiences in the ﬁrst quarter of 2005 up 60% on the same period 
in 2004.
It was UBC’s intention when it acquired full control of Oneword Radio 
to identify a strategic partner for the station with a shared vision of 
the prospects for digital radio in the UK. Following the ﬁnancial year-
end, in April 2005 UBC reached agreement with Channel 4 Television 
for Channel 4 to acquire a 51% interest in Oneword Radio for a cash 
consideration of £1 million. It is our expectation that the cost of UBC’s 
investment in Oneword Radio will reduce in the current year following 
the sale of a shareholding in the station. UBC and Channel 4 are 
currently working on plans jointly to develop Oneword Radio; building  
on what we believe is a valuable digital asset that has signiﬁcant  
growth prospects.
RADIO SERVICES
UBC’s Radio Services division comprises the Group’s digital software 
development and facilities businesses.
 2005 2004  
 £m £m % Change
Turnover 1.08 1.18 –8.47
 
Turnover from Radio Services in the year was £1.08 million (2004: £1.18 
million), representing a fall of 8.47% on the previous year. The decline in 
turnover experienced by Radio Services reﬂects a further fall in turnover 
from the Group’s facilities and studios business as we continue to focus 
on higher margin business in this area. This was partly compensated for 
in the period by a 45% increase in turnover from software sales to the 
radio industry.
Unique Interactive 
Unique Interactive continues to beneﬁt from the increasing investment by 
both UK and overseas radio broadcasters in their digital services. Unique 
Interactive’s development focus continues to be on the Group’s two main 
software products: the ‘ManDLS’ software, which is used to manage the 
scrolling text (Dynamic Label Segment) of a digital radio service; and the 
development of software to operate electronic programme guide (EPG) 
services which form part of the interactive capabilities of an emerging 
new generation of EPG-enabled digital devices.
Unique Interactive’s EPG software continues to be the only commercially 
available radio EPG, and it was a key element in the launch of the ﬁrst 
EPG-enabled receivers in early 2005. UBC has for a long time believed 
that the launch of EPG-capable digital radios will signiﬁcantly change 
the way that broadcasters and listeners utilise digital radio, and that 
in the future digital radios will incorporate features as standard which 
will transform the capabilities of the medium, such as rewind, record 
and download. These will enable additional access to a signiﬁcantly 
enhanced range of information services, and will change the current 
common perception that digital radio is only about greater listener 
choice and better sound quality.
Unique Interactive is a market leader in software development for digital 
radio services as a result of its early investment in this area and it is 
currently developing an increasing international proﬁle in the delivery of 
software solutions to the industry. Unique Interactive is currently working 
with a number of leading broadcasting and technology companies in 
the UK and overseas and we believe the next 12 months will see major 
developments that will reinforce UBC’s prominence in this area.
Since the year-end UBC has announced its intention to invest 
approximately £400,000 in the ﬁrst half of the current ﬁnancial year on 
creating an innovative service which will allow music to be downloaded 
over digital radio. The music downloading service will utilise data 
capacity on a number of digital radio multiplexes that are owned by UBC. 
The Company has begun negotiation with partners in the music and radio 
industries with whom it will work on bringing this service to market. The 
Company’s plans in this area are still at an early stage of development, 
but it is intended that investors will be updated on progress at the time 
of the Company’s interim announcement in November 2005.
Unique Facilities 
Unique Facilities delivered a satisfactory performance in the year to 
31 March 2005 and continued for much of the year to grow yields 
on the back of good occupancy rates. Despite operating in a highly 
competitive market, UBC’s facilities have operated at full capacity for 
extended periods during the year. In addition, Unique Facilities has 
sought to extend its audio creative services, with the successful launch 
of a number of new products, including the composition of theme and 
incidental music for television programmes and bespoke music jingles.
Acquisitions & disposals 
UBC increased its shareholding in Oneword Radio Limited to 100% on 
30 June 2004 when it acquired the 50% shareholding of USI Holdings 
Limited for £694,000. In consideration, UBC issued approximately 2.44 
million new UBC ordinary shares.
In July 2004 UBC increased its shareholding in Digital News Network, 
which broadcasts a regional data service on ﬁve MXR multiplexes, from 
21.95% to 28.05% at a cost of approximately £32,000.
In August 2004 UBC acquired the business of Smooth Operations, 
a leading UK independent regional radio producer. The acquisition 
consideration comprised an initial payment of £1.8 million, with a further 
maximum payment of £1.9 million depending upon the proﬁt growth in 
each of the two years following the acquisition. A cash payment of £1.2 
million and the issue of approximately 2.45 million new UBC ordinary 
shares satisﬁed the initial acquisition consideration, plus costs incurred 
in connection with the acquisition of £79,000. Any further consideration 
will be payable as to 60% in cash and 40% by the issue of new UBC 
FINANCIAL REVIEW 15
ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2005
ordinary shares. The ﬁrst part of the deferred consideration will become 
payable in the second-half of the ﬁnancial year to 31 March 2006, and 
this element is capped at £665,000 and is payable in a mixture of cash 
and new UBC ordinary shares.
In September 2004 UBC announced the acquisition of a 12.5% 
shareholding in Popworld Limited, which owns and controls the 
music programme, Popworld, broadcast on Channel 4 and MTV. The 
consideration of £250,000 was settled in cash. UBC had an option to 
increase its shareholding in Popworld further to 25% at any time up to 
the end of December 2004 for a further consideration of £250,000.  
The option was not exercised.
In April 2005 UBC sold a 51% interest in Oneword Radio Limited to 
Channel 4 Television Corporation for a cash consideration of £1 million. 
Channel 4’s investment in Oneword Radio represents the ﬁrst partnership 
of a national television and commercial radio station and potentially 
mirrors the BBC’s ownership of a cross-media brand. UBC and Channel 
4 are currently working together on ways to develop Oneword Radio, 
including cross-promoting Oneword Radio and utilising the Channel 4 
brand name.
Fund Raising and use of proceeds 
In July 2004 UBC placed approximately 7.8 million new ordinary shares 
with institutional investors, raising an additional £1.8 million (before 
expenses) for the Company. The net proceeds of the placing were 
used to satisfy the initial cash consideration and related costs of the 
acquisition of Smooth Operations and a 12.5% shareholding in Popworld 
Limited. The balance of the proceeds will be used to fund the balance of 
any deferred cash consideration of the acquisition.
Investment in digital radio 
During the year to 31 March 2005 UBC invested the following amounts 
in digital licences:
–   Investment in subsidiary companies of £1.50 million (2004: £1.52 
million), of which £963,000 (2004: £947,000) relates to carriage of 
Classic Gold Digital on digital multiplexes covering Northern England 
and Greater London and other areas which broaden Classic Gold 
Digital’s coverage; £394,000 (2004: £nil.) on Oneword Radio; and 
£144,000 (2004: £133,000) to data licence fees for broadcasting 
regional data services on ﬁve MXR digital multiplexes.
–  Joint Venture Investment of £60,000 (2004: £436,000) in 
Oneword Radio.
Cash Flow 
During the year UBC had a cash inﬂow from operating activities after 
digital licences and before investment in Oneword Radio and working 
capital of £96,000 (2004: –£520,000).
Cash 
At 31 March 2005 UBC had cash in the bank of £3.50 million  
(2004: £4.32 million).
International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) 
As a result of a review of its accounting policies it is UBC Media Group’s 
intention to comply with IFRS standards for the year ended 31 March 
2008 in accordance with regulations applicable to AIM listed companies.

The Board is not recommending the payment of a dividend.

UBC MEDIA GROUP PLC
REPORT OF THE DIRECTORS CONTINUED 
FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 MARCH 2005
Substantial shareholders
At 1 June 2005 the Company has been informed of the following interests of 3% or more in its ordinary shares of 1p 
each in issue at that date:
 
Re-election of directors 
In accordance with the Articles of Association J. Hodson, M.A. Honey, J.P . Quinn and R.S. Silverstone offer 
themselves for re-election at the forthcoming AGM, details of which are set out at the back of this annual report. 
Brief particulars of all directors can be found on page 16.
Corporate governance 
As an AIM listed company, UBC Media Group plc is not required to comply with the main provisions of the 
principles of good governance and code of best practice prepared by the Committee on Corporate Governance 
(the ‘Combined Code’). However, insofar as they are able for a company of its size, the Board complies with the 
provisions of the Combined Code. Details concerning the Group’s arrangements relating to corporate governance 
and its compliance with the Combined Code are given on pages 19 to 20. The Directors’ Report on Remuneration 
is given on page 22.
Annual General Meeting 
The following special business is being proposed at this year’s Annual General Meeting:
Authority to Directors to allot shares: Resolution 8 
The Companies Act 1985 provides that the directors may not allot shares unless empowered to do so by the 
shareholders. Such a power cannot be given for longer than ﬁve years at any one time and the total nominal value 
of shares that can be allotted must be speciﬁed. In order to renew the Board’s powers in respect of unissued shares 
it is, accordingly, proposed that the directors be granted general authority at any time prior to the expiry of ﬁfteen 
months following the forthcoming Annual General Meeting (or prior to the next Annual General Meeting of the 
Company, if earlier) to allot shares up to an aggregate nominal value of £255,979 representing approximately 15% 
of the current issued share capital.
Disapplication of pre-emption rights: Resolution 9 
This resolution is proposed for two reasons. Firstly, it renews the directors’ authority to implement rights issues 
without complying fully with the technical requirements of section 89 of the Companies Act 1985 (relating to the 
allotment of shares for cash). Secondly, the resolution gives the directors authority to allot shares for cash other 
than by way of rights to existing shareholders up to an aggregate nominal amount of £170,653. This power will 
provide the directors with the ﬂexibility to take advantage of business opportunities as they arise. Shareholders 
should note that the London Stock Exchange does not require shareholders’ speciﬁc approval for each issue 
of shares for cash on a pre-emptive basis to the extent that under section 95 of the Companies Act 1985 the 
provisions of section 89 are disapplied generally. If given, this authority will expire ﬁfteen months from the date 
of passing of the special resolution or, if earlier, on the date of the next Annual General meeting of the Company.
Employee involvement 
The Group places considerable value on the involvement of its employees and encourages the development of 
employee involvement in each of its operating companies through both formal and informal meetings. It is the 
Group’s policy to ensure that employees are made aware of signiﬁcant matters affecting the performance of the 
Group through information bulletins, informal meetings, team brieﬁngs, internal newsletters and the Group’s 
website and intranet.
Employee involvement 
The Group acknowledges the vital role that all employees play in its success through their skills, initiative and 
commitment. The Group endorses and supports the principles of equal opportunities and always fully considers 
applications by disabled persons. The policy in respect of staff that become disabled whilst employed is to train 
and assist them wherever practicable to continue within the Group. It is the policy of the Group to consider 
individuals on their merit and to make employment decisions on a non-discriminatory basis in compliance with its 
legal obligations. The Group’s policy is to ensure that, as far as is reasonably practicable, working environments 
exist which will minimise risk to the health and safety of employees.
Going concern 
After reviewing the Group’s budget for the year to 31 March 2006 and its medium-term plans, the directors have a 
reasonable expectation that the Group has adequate resources to continue in operation for the foreseeable future. 
Therefore they have adopted the going concern basis in preparing the ﬁnancial statements.
Charitable donations 
The Group made charitable contributions of £5,492 (2004: £738) during the year, of which £951 was donated to 
the Company’s selected charity, Macmillan Cancer Relief. The balance was advertising commission donated to the 
Tsunami Relief appeal. The Group made no political donations during the year.
Auditors 
The auditors, PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP , have indicated their willingness to continue in ofﬁce and a resolution 
that they be re appointed will be proposed at the Annual General Meeting.
Policy and practice on payment of creditors 
Each Group company is responsible for agreeing the details of terms and conditions relating to transactions with 
its suppliers where goods and services have been supplied in accordance with the relevant terms and conditions of 
the contract. Trade creditors for the Company at 31 March 2005 represented 41 days of purchases (31 March 2004: 
24 days of purchases).

ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2005
CORPORATE GOVERNANCE STATEMENT
As an AIM listed company, UBC Media Group plc is not required to comply with the main provisions of the principles of 
good governance and code of best practice prepared by the Committee on Corporate Governance (the ‘Combined Code’). 
However, the Company supports the principles of good governance laid down in the Combined Code and insofar as they 
are able, for a company of its size, the Board complies with the provisions of the Combined Code.
This statement provides details of how UBC Media Group has applied these principles and complied insofar as they are 
able for a company of its size with the detailed provisions of Section1 of the Combined Code.
The Board 
The Company is controlled through a Board of Directors, which at 31 March 2005 comprised four executive directors and 
eight non-executive directors. A non-executive director of the Company, K.R. Harris, resigned as a director on 26 May 
2005 and it is the intention of the non-executive director, I.M. Peacock, to resign from the Board at the Company’s AGM 
on 29 July 2005. Short biographies of each director are set out on page 16.
The role of the Chairman and that of the Chief Executive are separate and have been so since the Company’s formation.
The Senior Non-Executive Director is P .H.B. Pascoe.
The Chairman, who was appointed to the Board on 18 February 2005, is responsible for the leadership of the Board, 
ensuring its effectiveness in all aspects of its role and setting its agenda. The Chairman also ensures that the directors 
receive accurate, timely and clear information and that there is effective communication with shareholders. The 
Chairman also facilitates the effective contribution of the other Non-Executive Directors and ensures constructive 
relations between executive and non-executive directors.
The Chief Executive’s responsibilities are concerned with co-ordinating the Group’s business and implementing 
Group strategy.
The Board’s role is to provide entrepreneurial leadership of UBC Media Group within the framework of prudent and 
effective controls that enable risk to be assessed and managed. The Board is responsible for setting the Company’s 
strategic aims and for ensuring the ﬁnancial and human resources are in place for the Company to meet its objectives 
and to review management performance. The Board is also responsible for setting the Company’s values and standards 
and ensuring that its obligations to its shareholders are understood and met.
The Board dispatches its role by holding bi-monthly meetings, at which:
–  monthly management accounts, including budgets and prior year comparatives, are presented and reviewed;
–  strategy is set and policy is debated;
–  all signiﬁcant investment and acquisition opportunities are reviewed and, if appropriate, approval is given;
–  any proposed changes to internal control and operating policies are debated.
The Non-Executive Directors bring a wide range of experience and expertise to the Company’s affairs which allows 
them to constructively challenge and help develop proposals and strategy, scrutinise performance and controls and take 
decisions objectively in the interests of the Company. N.E. Edmonds and P .H.B. Pascoe, as representatives of Unique 
Communications Limited, a signiﬁcant shareholder in the Company, are not considered by the Board to be independent. 
In addition, T.J. Blackmore and I.M. Peacock, by reasons of their signiﬁcant shareholdings in the Company, are not 
considered by the Board to be independent; and K.R. Harris, by reason of his signiﬁcant shareholding in the Company, 
was not considered by the Board to be independent.
All directors are subject to election by shareholders at the ﬁrst opportunity after appointment and to re-election every 
three years. At the Annual General Meeting in 2004 I.M. Peacock, T.J. Blackmore and N.E. Edmonds were re-elected to 
the Board. Details of directors submitted for re-election at the forthcoming AGM are provided on page 46.
The Company indemniﬁes directors for claims made against them in relation to their duties, with the exception of any 
losses incurred as a result of their wilful negligence. Insurance cover with an annual limit of £1 million is maintained in 
respect of potential legal action.
The Board of Directors meets formally approximately six times a year. During the year attendance at formal meetings 
of the Board was as follows: T.J. Blackmore, S.A. Cole, K.R. Harris, K.F. Harrison, M.A. Honey, P .H.B. Pascoe, J.P . 
Quinn and R.S. Silverstone attended on six occasions; J.H. Donald attended ﬁve meetings; and I.M. Peacock attended 
four meetings. J. Hodson was appointed as a director of the Company on 18 February 2005 and in the period from 18 
February 2005 to 31 March 2005 attended one meeting of the Board. N.E. Edmonds did not attend any formal meetings 
of the Board. In addition there were a number of informal meetings of the Board.
The Company has adopted the Model Code for Directors’ dealings as applicable to AIM companies.
Financial Reporting and Going Concern 
The Board places considerable emphasis on ensuring that all communications with shareholders present a balanced  
and transparent assessment of the Group’s position and prospects. The Board or a sub-committee of the Board reviews 
and approves results announcements, interim reports, annual reports, the Chairman’s AGM statement and trading 
updates prior to their release. The directors’ statement of responsibilities in respect of the preparation of ﬁnancial 
statements is set out on page 21 and the Auditors’ statement on the respective responsibilities of directors and  
auditors is included within their report on page 23.
Internal Controls & Risk Management 
The Board is responsible for maintaining a sound system of internal control to safeguard shareholders’ investments and 
the Company’s assets. Such a system is designed to manage rather than eliminate the risk of failure to achieve business 
objectives and can provide only reasonable and not absolute assurance against material misstatement or loss. The 
Board regularly reviews this process and the effectiveness of the Group’s system of internal controls. The review  
covers all material controls, including ﬁnancial, operational and compliance controls and risk management systems. 
Committees of the Board 
The Board has three standing committees, being the Audit Committee, the Remuneration Committee and the 
Nominations Committee, each of which operate within deﬁned terms of reference.
Audit Committee 
The Audit Committee consists of P .B.H. Pascoe, as chairman, K.F. Harrison and R.S. Silverstone. The Audit Committee 
has primary responsibility for monitoring the integrity of the ﬁnancial statements of the Company; reviewing the  20

The Committee has direct access to the Company’s auditors and meets with the auditors at least once a year without 
executive management being present. The Audit Committee met formally twice during the year.
During the year to 31 March 2005 K.R. Harris was chairman of the Audit Committee and P .H.B. Pascoe, I.M. Peacock, 
K.F. Harrison and R.S. Silverstone were members of the Committee. Since the year-end I.M. Peacock and K.R. Harris

Remuneration Committee 
The Remuneration Committee consists of K.F. Harrison, as chairman, J. Hodson, P .H.B. Pascoe and R.S. Silverstone. 
Further details of the Committee’s remit are contained in the Remuneration Committee report on page 22.

During the year to 31 March 2005 P .H.B. Pascoe was chairman of the Remuneration Committee and I.M. Peacock,

Nominations Committee 
The Nominations Committee is responsible for succession planning and ensuring that all appointments to the Board are 
objective. The Committee oversees the selection and appointment of directors, making its recommendations to the full 
Board. The Committee meets as and when required. The Nominations Committee met twice during the year.  
The Committee consists of J. Hodson, as chairman, S.A. Cole and J.H. Donald.

and J. Hodson was appointed as a member and as chairman of the Nominations Committee.
Relations with Shareholders 
The Board is committed to maintaining good communications with shareholders. The Chief Executive and the Finance 
Director maintain a regular dialogue with institutional shareholders throughout the year. The executive directors give 
presentations to analysts and hold one-to-one formal meetings with the Group’s key shareholders immediately following 
the announcement of the Group’s full year and interim results. The Group obtains independent feedback on these 
meetings through its corporate brokers, and this feedback is disclosed to the Board.
The Company responds formally to all queries and requests for information from existing and prospective shareholders. 
In addition, J. Hodson and P .H.B. Pascoe are available to shareholders to ensure that any potential concerns can be 
raised directly. The Group’s Annual Report and Accounts, preliminary and interim announcements, trading statements 
and press releases are available on its website at www.ubcmedia.com.
Constructive use of the AGM 
The Board uses the Annual General Meeting to communicate with both institutional and private shareholders. 
Resolutions are proposed on each substantially separate issue and the agenda includes a resolution to adopt the 
Group’s Annual Report and Accounts. Details of the proxy votes for and against each resolution are announced after  
the result of the hand votes is known. After the formal business of the Meeting has been concluded, the Chairman 
invites shareholder questions to the Board. 21
ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2005
STATEMENT OF DIRECTORS’ RESPONSIBILITIES
Company law requires the directors to prepare ﬁnancial statements for each ﬁnancial year that give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the 
Company and the Group and of the proﬁt or loss of the Group for that year. The directors are required to prepare the ﬁnancial statements on the going 
concern basis, unless it is inappropriate to presume the Group will continue in business.
The directors conﬁrm that, in preparing the ﬁnancial statements, suitable accounting policies have been used and applied. They also conﬁrm that 
reasonable and prudent judgements and estimates have been made in preparing the ﬁnancial statements for the year ended 31 March 2005 and that 
applicable accounting standards have been followed.
The maintenance and integrity of the Company’s websites is the responsibility of the directors. Legislation in the United Kingdom governing the 
preparation and dissemination of ﬁnancial statements may differ from legislation in other jurisdictions.
The directors are responsible for maintaining proper accounting records that disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the ﬁnancial position of the 
Company and the Group and enable them to ensure that the ﬁnancial statements comply with the Companies Act 1985. They are also responsible for 
safeguarding the assets of the Company and the Group and hence for taking reasonable steps for the prevention and detection of fraud and  
other irregularities.

On 6 June 2005 the non-executive directors, T.J. Blackmore, N.E. Edmonds, K.F. Harrison, P .H.B. Pascoe and R.S. Silverstone were appointed as non-executive

However, we voluntarily disclose the following information.
The Board has established a Remuneration Committee with formally delegated duties and responsibilities, 
consisting of K.F. Harrison as chairman, J. Hodson, P .H.B. Pascoe and R.S. Silverstone. The provisions of the

Committee. However, it is considered that J. Hodson’s experience and knowledge is of considerable value to  
the Committee and as a result he has been appointed a member of the Committee. The Remuneration Committee  
has responsibility for determining executive directors’ terms and conditions of service, including remuneration  
and grant of options under the Share Option Schemes.

(2) No beneﬁts are provided for under the terms of N.E. Edmonds’ engagement
– incentivise directors to maximise shareholder value through share options and the payment of an annual bonus.
Executive directors participate in an annual bonus plan under which in the year to 31 March 2005 their maximum 
bonus potential was 25% of salary. The primary measure used to assess performance under the bonus plan 
in the year to 31 March 2005 for all executive directors was Group and divisional proﬁtability compared to 
market expectation. In the year to 31 March 2006 it is proposed that, in order to increase the incentives for over 
performance at divisional and Group level, the maximum potential annual bonus for all executive directors  
is changed to 50% and which will be measured wholly against Group and divisional proﬁtability against  
market expectation.
The remuneration of each of the directors for the year ended 31 March 2005 was as follows: 23
ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2005
INDEPENDENT AUDITORS’ REPORT
Independent auditors’ report to the members of UBC Media Group plc
We have audited the ﬁnancial statements, which comprise the consolidated proﬁt and loss account, the consolidated and company balance sheets,  
the consolidated cash ﬂow statement, and the related notes.
Respective responsibilities of directors and auditors 
The directors’ responsibilities for preparing the annual report and the ﬁnancial statements in accordance with applicable United Kingdom law and 
accounting standards are set out in the statement of directors’ responsibilities. 
Our responsibility is to audit the ﬁnancial statements in accordance with relevant legal and regulatory requirements and United Kingdom Auditing 
Standards issued by the Auditing Practices Board. This report, including the opinion, has been prepared for and only for the company’s members as a body 
in accordance with Section 235 of the Companies Act 1985 and for no other purpose. We do not, in giving this opinion, accept or assume responsibility  
for any other purpose or to any other person to whom this report is shown or into whose hands it may come save where expressly agreed by our prior 
consent in writing.
We report to you our opinion as to whether the ﬁnancial statements give a true and fair view and are properly prepared in accordance with the Companies 
Act 1985. We also report to you if, in our opinion, the directors’ report is not consistent with the ﬁnancial statements, if the company has not kept proper 
accounting records, if we have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit, or if information speciﬁed by law regarding 
directors’ remuneration and transactions is not disclosed.
We read the other information contained in the annual report and consider the implications for our report if we become aware of any apparent 
misstatements or material inconsistencies with the ﬁnancial statements. The other information comprises only the Chairman’s Statement, the Chief 
Executive’s Statement, the Financial Review, the Report of the Directors, the Corporate Governance Statement and the Remuneration Report.
Basis of audit opinion 
We conducted our audit in accordance with auditing standards issued by the Auditing Practices Board. An audit includes examination, on a test basis, 
of evidence relevant to the amounts and disclosures in the ﬁnancial statements. It also includes an assessment of the signiﬁcant estimates and 
judgements made by the directors in the preparation of the ﬁnancial statements, and of whether the accounting policies are appropriate to the company’s 
circumstances, consistently applied and adequately disclosed.
We planned and performed our audit so as to obtain all the information and explanations which we considered necessary in order to provide us with 
sufﬁcient evidence to give reasonable assurance that the ﬁnancial statements are free from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or other 
irregularity or error. In forming our opinion we also evaluated the overall adequacy of the presentation of information in the ﬁnancial statements.
Opinion 
In our opinion the ﬁnancial statements give a true and fair view of the state of the state of affairs of the Company and the Group at 31 March 2005 and 
of the loss and cash ﬂows of the Group for the year then ended and have been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 1985.

UBC MEDIA GROUP PLC
NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 MARCH 2005
1. PRINCIPAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES 
 
The ﬁnancial statements have been prepared in accordance with applicable accounting standards in the  
United Kingdom. A summary of the more important accounting policies, which have been consistently applied, 
is set out below.
Basis of accounting 
The ﬁnancial statements are prepared in accordance with the historical cost convention.
Basis of consolidation 
The group ﬁnancial statements consolidate the ﬁnancial statements of the company and its subsidiary 
undertakings. The ﬁnancial statements of each subsidiary company have been prepared to 31 March for 2004  
and 2005. Intra-group sales and proﬁts are eliminated on consolidation.
As permitted by Section 230 of the Companies Act, a separate proﬁt and loss account is not presented for  
UBC Media Group plc.
The company loss after taxation for the year amounted to £30,000 (2004: £36,000).
Joint ventures are accounted for by the gross equity method from the date of their formation to the date of their 
sale. A fair value is attributed to the group’s share of separable assets and liabilities acquired on the formation of 
the joint venture and any excess of consideration over this fair value is disclosed in the balance sheet. 
Comparative information 
In the prior year, the Group separately analysed Goodwill and Development Items. This comprised goodwill 
amortisation, digital licence costs and the total share of operating loss in joint ventures. In the current year, the 
Group has separately analysed Goodwill and Digital Licences, which comprises goodwill amortisation and digital 
licences only. Accordingly, £178,000 of the Share of operating loss in joint ventures in the year ended 31 March 
2004 previously categorised as Development Items has been restated to the results before goodwill and digital 
licences.
Turnover  
Turnover excludes intra-group sales, Value Added Tax and trade discounts and comprises:
–  sale of programmes and content. The value of goods and services supplied is recognised in accordance with 
contract terms, which is generally on delivery. Production costs are recognised on the same date as the relevant 
turnover.
–  sale of advertising time. The amount invoiced to customers is recognised on the date the relevant advertisement 
is aired.
Fixed assets 
The cost of ﬁxed assets is their purchase cost, together with any incidental expenses of acquisition.
Depreciation is calculated so as to write off the cost of tangible ﬁxed assets, less their estimated residual values, 
on a straight-line basis over the expected useful economic lives of the assets concerned. The residual value is 
 
 
estimated taking into account obsolescence, technological development and expected proceeds on disposal.  
The principal annual rates used for this purpose are:
 
 %
Technical equipment 50 
Motor vehicles 25 
Computer equipment 33 
Ofﬁce equipment 20
 
The short leasehold refurbishment costs are amortised over the period of the extended lease. 
  
The short leasehold building was fully amortised over the period of the original lease.
The group selects its depreciation rates carefully and reviews them regularly to take into account any changes 
in circumstances. When setting useful economic lives, the principal factors the group takes into account are the 
expected rate of technological developments, expected market requirements for the equipment and the intensity at 
which the assets are expected to be used. The carrying value of the tangible ﬁxed assets is assessed annually and 
any impairment in value is charged to the proﬁt and loss.
Intangible assets 
Intangible assets are included at cost less provision for impairment, if applicable. The provision for impairment is 
assessed by reference to an estimate of the present value of future cashﬂows projected to arise from the relevant 
intangible assets.
Amortisation is calculated to write off the cost of intangible assets on a straight-line basis over its expected useful 
economic life. The useful economic life is estimated by reference to the period over which each asset is estimated 
to be capable of earning revenue. The carrying value of intangible assets is assessed annually and any impairment 
in value is charged to the proﬁt and loss account. The expected useful economic life is the term of the licence in 
question.
Goodwill 
Goodwill arising on consolidation represents the excess of the fair value of the consideration given over the fair 
values of the identiﬁable net assets acquired. Goodwill arising on consolidation has been capitalised and is being 
written off over its expected useful economic life. The expected useful economic life varies between 7-10 years. 
The amortisation expense in respect of goodwill relating to joint ventures is included as part of the Group’s share of 
operating loss of the joint venture. The carrying value of the goodwill is assessed annually and any impairment in 
value is charged to the proﬁt and loss account.

3 29
ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2005
Purchased goodwill in relation to the Classic Gold analogue service is included at cost and is amortised over the 
life of the underlying analogue radio licences, ranging from 5 months to 33 months. Purchased goodwill in relation 
to the Classic Gold digital service has been fully impaired in line with expected future cash ﬂows from digital radio 
in the short term. The carrying value of the goodwill is assessed annually and any impairment in value is charged to 
the proﬁt and loss account.
The decision to amortise goodwill arising from the acquisition of Smooth Operations (Productions) Limited over 7 
years reﬂects UBC Media Group’s view of the strength of Smooth Operations (Productions) Limited’s position in the 
specialist music areas of Country & Western music and Folk music; the likelihood that Country & Western and Folk 
music will continue to form a part of the BBC’s specialist music output; and UBC Media Group’s conﬁdence that the 
BBC will increase the percentage of its output which it commissions from the independent production sector.
Work in progress 
Programmes in production are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value and included in work in progress. 
Programme material is written off fully on ﬁrst transmission or sale. Expenditure relating to programmes that have 
been commissioned for production is carried forward at cost.
Deferred taxation  
Deferred taxation arises as a liability or asset if transactions have occurred at the balance sheet date that give rise 
to an obligation to pay more taxation in future, or a right to pay less taxation in future. The deferred tax liability 
that is the result of timing differences that are not permanent is recognised in full. Deferred tax assets are only 
recognised to the extent that, on the basis of all available evidence, they are recoverable. Deferred tax assets and 
liabilities recognised have not been discounted.
Pension scheme 
The Group operates a money purchase pension scheme. The contributions are accounted for as they fall due.
Finance and operating leases 
Costs in respect of operating leases are charged on a straight-line basis over the lease term. Where tangible ﬁxed 
assets are ﬁnanced by leasing agreements, which transfer to the group substantially all the beneﬁts and risks of 
ownership, the assets are treated as if they had been purchased outright and are included in tangible ﬁxed assets. 
The capital element of the leasing commitments is shown as obligations under ﬁnance leases. The lease rentals 
are treated as consisting of capital and interest elements. The capital element is applied to reduce the outstanding 
obligations and the interest element is charged against proﬁt in proportion to the reducing capital element 
outstanding. Assets held under ﬁnance leases are depreciated over the shorter of the lease terms and the useful 
lives of equivalent owned assets.
Costs of share options schemes 
As a result of the grant of share options under an unapproved share option scheme since 6 April 1999, the 
group will be obliged to pay National Insurance contributions on the difference between the market value of the 
underlying shares and their exercise price when the options are exercised. The liability is estimated using the 
market value of the Company’s shares at each balance sheet date. The movement in the provision is charged to the 
proﬁt and loss account as a staff cost. 
The group is also obliged to pay National Insurance contributions on the difference between the market value 
at the date of the grant (or the market value at each balance sheet date, if lower) and the option price for share 
options issued under the Enterprise Management Incentive Scheme.
Costs incurred on issue of shares 
The share premium account has been debited with £114,000 (2004: £21,000) being the costs associated with the 
raising of new equity funds. These include fees from professional advisors.
Financial instruments 
The group does not use or trade in derivative ﬁnancial instruments.
Capital instruments that contain an obligation to transfer economic beneﬁt, such as debt issues, are classiﬁed as 
liabilities and are recorded at their net proceeds. The ﬁnance costs in respect of such liabilities recognised in the 
proﬁt and loss account are allocated to periods over the term of the instrument at a constant rate on the carrying 
amount. Financial assets are recorded at cost and the return on such assets is accrued in the period to which it 
relates.
2. MERGER ACCOUNTING  
 
UBC Media Group plc merged with The Unique Broadcasting Company Limited on 22 June 2000 and has 
accounted for the combination using merger accounting principles as a result of the group reconstruction. The 
issue of 100,635,000 equity shares with a nominal value of 1p each satisﬁed the consideration. The fair value 
of the consideration was £6,038,000 at 22 June 2000. No signiﬁcant adjustments were deemed necessary to 
the assets and liabilities of The Unique Broadcasting Company Limited which have been recorded at their book 
values immediately prior to their merger and no adjustments were required to be made to the net assets of UBC 
Media Group plc. The book value of net assets of UBC Media Group plc and The Unique Broadcasting Company 
Limited at the date of the combination were £2 and £308,000 respectively. The other reserve of £801,350 arises on 
consolidation due to the difference between the nominal value of the shares issued by the Company of £1,006,350 
and the nominal value of The Unique Broadcasting Company Limited’s shares and share premium acquired of 
£205,000. The Unique Broadcasting Company Limited’s ﬁnancial year began on 1 April 2000. 30

Basic loss per share is calculated by dividing the loss attributable to shareholders by the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue during the year. 
For diluted loss per share, the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue is adjusted to assume conversion of all potential dilutive ordinary shares. 
In 2005 and 2004, the options or warrants outstanding were anti-dilutive. Reconciliation of the loss and weighted average number of shares used in the 
calculation are set out below.

The Group’s ﬁnancial instruments comprise its borrowings, consisting of its loan and convertible loan notes, bank 
overdrafts and ﬁnance lease liabilities, cash and short-term deposits, loans to its joint ventures and various items 
such as trade debtors and trade creditors that arise directly from its operations. The main purpose of the ﬁnancial 
liabilities is to provide ﬁnance for the Group’s operations in the year between raising equity funding. The main 
purpose of the ﬁnancial assets is to provide some ﬁnance to its joint ventures or as a store of liquid resources.
The Group has no exposure to foreign currency risk; thus the main risks arising from the Group’s ﬁnancial 
instruments are interest rate risk and liquidity risk. The Board reviews and agrees policies for managing these risks 
and they are summarised below. These policies have remained unchanged throughout the year under review. 
Interest rate risk 
The Group primarily ﬁnances its operations through raising of equity ﬁnance from its shareholders and thus is not 
generally exposed to interest rate risk on ﬁnancial liabilities. However, some ﬁnancing of ﬁxed assets has been 
achieved using ﬂoating rate ﬁnance leases and in the past a small amount of temporary funding has been taken 
through a bank overdraft. For the remaining loan note of £337,000 with market interest rates at their current low 
level, the group has not sought to protect itself from the adverse cash ﬂow effects should market interest rates 
rise.
In respect of its loans to its joint ventures these are in the nature of quasi-equity and do not bear interest. 
Consequently, the Group bears the loss of a return on these investments
The Group’s policy is to ensure that to the best of its ability it maximises the interest income on its surplus cash. 
This involves placing cash in a mix of ﬁxed rate and ﬂoating rate short-term deposits. There is no prescribed ratio  
of ﬁxed to ﬂoating rate.
Liquidity risk           
The Group’s policy throughout the year under review has been to ensure the continuity of funding. Of the 
convertible loan debt ﬁnancing of £1,686,000 secured in October 2001, £1,349,000 was repaid in May 2002 out of 
the proceeds of the equity ﬁnancing completed in April 2002. The remaining debt ﬁnancing of £337,000 is interest-
free if repaid before 1 October 2011.
Short-term debtors and creditors 
Short-term debtors and creditors have been excluded from the disclosures.
27. CONTINGENT LIABILITIES 
 
Legal Claim 
The directors have sought legal advice in connection with legal claims being brought against The Unique 
Broadcasting Company Limited (“Unique”) by one of their customers for services provided by Unique. In November 
1999, Radio Dimensione Sound (“RDS”) commenced proceedings against Unique and against Elemedia SpA in the 
court of Milan for £800,000. Unique has denied the claims. A hearing was held on 6 February 2002, which decided 
against the Italian courts having jurisdiction to try the case under all counts with the exception of pre-contractual 
liabilities. Having considered legal advice, the directors are conﬁdent of successfully defending this claim, however 
they have now indicated their willingness to settle for Euro 15,000 (circa £10,000) to overcome the aggravation 
factor associated with legal action. RDS has indicated their willingness to settle and have indicated that the 
current offer of Euro 15,000 is satisfactory. Therefore the directors have provided for Euro 15,000 in the proﬁt  
& loss account in the year ended 31 March 2005. The directors have been advised that the Italian courts 
have delayed their judgment on the ﬁnal outstanding claim of pre-contracted liability pending the settlement 
of the dispute.
28. PENSION COMMITMENTS  
 
The assets of the money purchase pension schemes are held in separate trustee-administered funds. The Group 
made contributions of £50,000 (2004: £64,000) into the money purchase scheme.
29. DIVIDENDS AND APPROPRIATIONS  
 
No dividends have been proposed for the year ended 31 March 2005 (2004: £nil).
30. RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS  
 
FRS8 “Related Party Transactions” requires the disclosure of the details of transactions between the reporting 
entity and related parties. The Group has taken advantage of the exemption under FRS8 not to disclose 
transactions between group companies.
Transactions with directors 
During the year there were no transactions with directors.
Transactions with joint ventures 
During the year the Group charged Oneword Radio Limited £17,000 (2004: £136,000) and The Digizone Limited 
£32,000 (2004: £41,000) for the provision of management, technical and administration services and studio 
facilities.
For the period 1 April 2004 to 30 June 2004 the Group loaned £90,000 to Oneword Radio Limited.
Details of balances held with Group companies at the year-end are disclosed in notes 16 and 17. NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED

32. FUTURE LIABILITIES 
On exercise of share options after 6 April 1999, the Company will be required to pay National Insurance on the difference between the exercise 
price and the market value of the shares issued. As described in note 20 the options issued by the Company since 6 April 1999 will vest at various 
dates. The Company will become unconditionally liable to pay the National Insurance upon exercise of the options. The amount of National Insurance 
payable will depend upon the number of employees who remain with the Company and exercise their options, the market value of the Company’s 
ordinary shares at the time of exercise and the prevailing National Insurance rate at that time. At 31 March 2005 an amount of £26,000 (2004: 
£32,000) was provided based on the year-end share price of 29.25 pence (2004: 32 pence).   45

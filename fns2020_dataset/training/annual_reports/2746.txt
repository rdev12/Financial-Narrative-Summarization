CORPORATE OVERVIEW
Highlights of 2010 include:
The successful startup of piped oil 
production from the large Mangala 
field in India, contributing a record 
turnover of $1.6 billion and profit  
of $1.1 billion;
The commencement of our potentially 
transformational multi-well and 
multi-year exploration drilling 
programme offshore Greenland; and
The announcement of the proposed 
part sale of up to 51% of Cairn’s 
shareholding in Cairn India (CIL) to 
Vedanta Resources Plc (Vedanta).
Rajasthan crude is now transported to a 
number of Indian refineries by the world’s 
longest continuously heated pipeline, which 
was built, and is operated, by Cairn India. 
This infrastructure is strategically important 
as it means all the remaining fields and 
discoveries can be tied-in to the pipeline  
as they are developed. The total resource 
base supports a combined potential 
production of 240,000 barrels of oil per  
day (bopd), subject to further investment 
and Government of India (GoI) and joint 
venture (JV) partner approvals. 
The accelerated multi-well and multi-year 
exploration campaign planned in the 
frontier basins of Greenland means  
Cairn is now the largest acreage holder 
offshore Greenland and the most active 
operator in this new frontier. There is 
heightened industry interest in this region, 
as exemplified by the number of major oil 
companies participating in the Baffin Bay 
bid round in May and the subsequent 
block awards in December. 
INDIA
The IPO of Cairn India in 2007 provided  
a return of $1 billion cash to Cairn 
shareholders and generated sufficient 
financial flexibility to allow the fast-track 
development of Cairn’s (discovered and 
appraised) world-class fields in Rajasthan. 
The completion of the first phase of the 
Rajasthan development represents a 
significant milestone for the Cairn Group, 
with the Mangala field now producing at  
an initial plateau rate of 125,000 bopd.  
The overall development project is now 
materially de-risked from a technical and 
commercial perspective, and demonstrates 
significant shareholder value creation.
In the summer of 2010, Cairn was 
approached by Vedanta with a proposal  
to purchase the majority of Cairn’s equity  
in Cairn India. This presented Cairn and  
its shareholders with an early opportunity  
to realise a large proportion of the value 
created. The proposed transaction  
was agreed and announced by the two 
companies in August, and approved by 
Cairn and Vedanta shareholders in Q4 2010.  03

The transaction is currently awaiting  
GoI approval.
GREENLAND 
The Group’s strong financial position  
and entrepreneurial exploration focus has 
allowed it to build a strategic and leading 
early entry position in the frontier offshore 
basins of Greenland, a country which Cairn 
believes has the necessary geological 
ingredients for exploration success.  
Cairn currently operates 11 blocks with  
a combined area of 102,000km
2
, which is 
equivalent to 15 quadrants or 450 blocks 
in the UK North Sea.
Cairn successfully drilled three wells and 
acquired 15,000km of seismic offshore 
Greenland in 2010, and all operations  
were carried out safely and without a 
major incident. 
In January 2011, Cairn increased its equity 
interest to 87 .5% and became operator of 
the sub-Arctic Atammik and Lady Franklin 
blocks offshore west Greenland. These 
prospective blocks are virtually free of sea 
ice throughout the year and consequently 
offer a potentially wider operating window.
To conduct its planned 2011 exploration 
campaign offshore Greenland, Cairn has 
contracted a sixth-generation drill ship  
and a fifth-generation semi-submersible 
drilling unit to drill up to four wells during 
the summer. Cairn also intends to acquire 
three 3D seismic surveys (approximately 
1,500km
2
 each); two of the surveys are 
planned over high-graded lead and 
prospect areas, whilst the exact location  
of the third is yet to be decided. 
Wherever it is active, Cairn seeks to 
operate in a safe and prudent manner  
and recognises that our activities can  
have an impact on the environment.  
The Greenlandic Bureau of Minerals and 
Petroleum has established some of the 
most stringent operating regulations 
anywhere globally, which mirror those 
applied in the Norwegian North Sea.  
The Greenland Government and Cairn put 
a thorough and robust operations strategy 
in place even before the incident in the 
Gulf of Mexico. Following this industry 
incident, the Greenland Government and 
Cairn reviewed the planned exploration 
programme to ensure that the lessons 
learned which were not already part of  
the Greenland drilling operations plan 
were captured and applied to the 2010 
exploration drilling programme.
PEOPLE
I would like to recognise all the creative 
effort, hard work and commitment the 
management, employees and contractor 
teams working in South Asia for Cairn have 
put in during our work in this region for 
more than 20 years. Working effectively with 
government and partners is fundamental 
wherever we operate, but the complexity  
of the Rajasthan development in particular 
has meant that such collaboration was 
critical to achieve success. Cairn’s 
experience has shown it is possible to build 
world-class businesses and, when the time 
is right, to realise value for shareholders.
Cairn no longer has any interests in 
Bangladesh after 16 years of exploration, 
development and production activities. 
During this period, Cairn discovered, 
developed and brought to production 
the offshore Sangu gas field and I would 
like to thank all the past and present  
Cairn personnel who were involved  
during this period.
I would also like to thank the asset 
management and project teams working 
on the Greenland programme over the  
past three years and, in particular, everyone 
involved during the first year of the drilling 
operations in 2010. The safe and efficient 
operations undertaken by Cairn is a 
testament to the hard work, dedication and 
commitment shown by all those involved. 
BOARD
Two new independent non-executive 
directors, Ms M. Jacqueline Sheppard  
QC and Alexander Berger, were appointed 
in 2010 to the Cairn Energy PLC Board.  
Ms Sheppard was previously Executive 
Vice-President, Corporate and Legal at 
Talisman Energy Inc. in Calgary, a post she 
held for 15 years. Mr Berger is currently 
CEO of Oranje-Nassau Energie B.V., a 
private Dutch exploration and production 
company based in Amsterdam and active 
both in the North Sea and internationally. 
These appointments greatly strengthen 
the industry knowledge represented on 
the Cairn Board, and continue the Board’s 
goal of striving for diversity among its 
directors and senior executives.
OUTLOOK
The potential completion of the Vedanta 
transaction would uniquely position Cairn 
to return significant value to shareholders 
whilst retaining the financial flexibility to 
continue to focus on Cairn’s core expertise 
in exploration. 2011 looks set to be an 
exciting year for Cairn as we continue  
to pursue future growth opportunities.

Chief Executive’s 
REVIEW
“ Cairn continues to believe the necessary approvals to 
complete the Vedanta transaction will be received and  
is working with the Government of India in a positive  
and constructive manner.
   The planned sale of Cairn’s majority stake in India would  
lead to a significant return of capital to shareholders  
whilst maintaining balance sheet strength and flexibility.
  Cairn is continuing its active exploration programme  
offshore Greenland which has the potential for 
transformational growth while also seeking to  
add new opportunities. ”  
 
SIR BILL GAMMELL
CHIEF EXECUTIVE 
 
Following more than 20 years of successful 
exploration, development and production 
in South Asia, Cairn has built a material 
business in India of strategic significance. 
This led to Cairn receiving an offer in  
the summer of 2010 for the purchase  
by Vedanta of the majority of Cairn’s 
shareholding in CIL.
This transaction is an opportunity to 
realise value from our strategic stake, 
return significant capital to shareholders 
and return Cairn to doing what it does 
best: taking an entrepreneurial approach 
to exploring for new hydrocarbon sources 
in frontier basins so providing shareholders 
with exposure to future transformational 
potential while maintaining balance  
sheet strength and flexibility. I would like 
to take this opportunity to extend my 
appreciation to all of those who have 
contributed to our success in India. 
INDIA
Mangala is the largest oil discovery  
in India for more than 20 years. It was 
brought on stream in August 2009 and 
inaugurated at a ceremony by the Indian 
Prime Minister, Dr Manmohan Singh. The 
initial crude was evacuated by road tanker. 
In June 2010, CIL completed the world’s 
longest continuously heated pipeline, 
which allowed Mangala production to 
increase to 125,000 bopd in August 2010. 
The next fields to be placed on production 
will be the Bhagyam and Aishwariya fields.
The Mangala, Bhagyam and Aishwariya 
(MBA) fields, at the field development  
plan (FDP) approved level of 175,000  
bopd, will produce more than 20%  
of India’s overall domestic crude oil 
production. The resource base can 
support production of 240,000 bopd, 
subject to all required consents and 
further investment. Consequently,  
oil production from Rajasthan can 
significantly reduce India’s crude  
import costs and provide increased 
energy security for the country.  07

GREENLAND
The US Geological Survey (USGS) in  
2008 highlighted the multi-billion barrels 
of oil equivalent (boe) risked resource 
potential of the Greenland geological 
basins. The survey found the country  
to be one of the top ten ‘yet to find’ 
hydrocarbon destinations globally.  
In this context, it is noteworthy that Cairn 
operates the largest acreage position 
(102,000km
2
, which is equivalent to 15 
quadrants in the UK North Sea) and is 
currently the most active explorer in  
the country. The significant scale of this 
position means Cairn is now better able to 
consider the portfolio management of the 
risk and reward balance as its investment 
in the exploration programme continues. 
Last year, Cairn embarked on the first 
exploration programme offshore 
Greenland in ten years, and first drilling 
within the Greenland Arctic for 35 years.
In December 2010, the Government of 
Greenland announced the results of the 
Baffin Bay bid round. Cairn was awarded 
an 87 .5% interest in three blocks: Ingoraq, 
Napariaq and Pitu, with its partner Nunaoil 
(12.5%), the Greenland National State oil 
company. Evidence of the increased 
industry interest in the area was shown 
with Shell, Statoil, GDF, Conoco-Phillips 
and Maersk among the other recipients  
of block awards. 
In January 2011, the Government of 
Greenland confirmed Cairn as the Operator 
of the Atammik and Lady Franklin blocks, 
and Cairn has acquired the 47 .5% interest 
previously held by Encana. The entitlement 
interests in these two blocks are now Cairn 
(Operator): 87 .5% and Nunaoil: 12.5%.  
The acquisition of these blocks provides 
material additional prospectivity and also 
operational flexibility as they are virtually 
free of sea ice all year round.
Over the past three years, Cairn has 
acquired more than 85,000km of 2D 
seismic, and during 2010 and into 2011 
completed a record 13 consecutive 
months of continuous activity offshore 
Greenland. 
We have been greatly encouraged by the 
well results from the 2010 drilling campaign, 
which, from an exploration viewpoint, 
proved that the previously undrilled Baffin 
Bay basin is hydrocarbon-generative and 
possesses active petroleum systems. 
However, none of the wells drilled to  
date encountered thick reservoirs in the 
Tertiary section. Also, the Cretaceous 
section prognosed in the Alpha well was 
not reached in the time available due  
to an unexpectedly thick sequence of 
Tertiary volcanics. 
The geochemical analyses of the 
hydrocarbons sampled in the wells 
indicate the presence of two types of  
gas (biogenic and thermogenic) and three 
types of oil, one of which is pre-Tertiary 
and presumed Mesozoic in age, being 
similar in composition to the Itilli oil  
seeps seen onshore in the Nuussuaq  
area. It is the presence of this latter oil 
type in the Alpha well that is of particular 
interest because it demonstrates a 
working hydrocarbon system beneath  
the volcanics. It gives fresh impetus to  
the future exploration programmes in the 
offshore Baffin Bay basins as we continue 
to explore for the thick, high quality and 
prospective Cretaceous reservoirs seen  
at outcrops onshore in the Nuussuaq basin 
and further south in the Qulleq well drilled 
by Statoil offshore Greenland in 2000.

CAIRN’S 
STRATEGY
Cairn’s strategy is to establish 
commercial reserves from  
strategic positions in high- 
potential exploration plays  
in order to create and deliver 
shareholder value.
The Company has focused on gaining 
early entry into key geographic regions 
such as India and Greenland. Cairn has 
an experienced senior management 
team geared to delivering value for all 
stakeholders. In the implementation 
of this strategy, the Group focuses on 
identifying assets that are capable of 
providing significant and sustainable 
growth through exploration and value 
through development. 08 Cairn Energy PLC Annual Report 2010
Cairn has now drilled three of the total nine exploration  
wells drilled offshore Greenland to date, previously five  
wells were drilled in the 1970s and one in 2000. 
 
 
CHIEF EXECUTIVE’S REVIEW 
(CONTINUED)
Cairn has now drilled three of the total  
nine exploration wells drilled offshore 
Greenland to date, previously five wells 
were drilled in the 1970s and one in 2000. 
No previous operators were able to benefit 
from a sustained campaign. Following 
Cairn’s successful operations in 2010,  
the Company’s multi-year exploration 
campaign is planned to continue in 2011. 
Subject to approval from the Government 
of Greenland, the main elements of the 
2011 exploration campaign, are:
The drilling of up to four exploration 
wells;
Three shallow (~400m) marine  
soil investigations to obtain critical 
stratigraphic information. These will  
be drilled in the north of Baffin Bay,  
the Disko area and the south  
offshore Greenland (across a distance 
equivalent to that between Edinburgh 
and Rome); and
Three 3D seismic surveys (total 
~4,500km
2
), one in the north of Baffin 
Bay, one in the south of Greenland and 
one location to be decided dependent 
on early drilling results. 
The final selection of prospects and well 
targets for the proposed 2011 exploration 
campaign will be made in May 2011. 
Cairn has again secured two state-of-the-art 
dynamically positioned drilling vessels  
for its planned 2011 dual rig exploration 
programme. Both of these drilling units 
are owned and operated by Ocean Rig. 
Cairn and its partner Nunaoil are currently 
completing a public consultation process 
with regard to the 201 1 exploration 
programme. The process includes engaging 
with a number of communities along the 
western coast of Greenland and the 
submission of Environmental and Social 
Impact Assessment studies. Feedback from 
these consultations will be used to tailor  
the programme to minimise and mitigate 
against any potential negative impacts.
FINANCIAL REVIEW
This year, the Group has delivered record 
revenues of ~$1.6 billion, profit after tax 
before exceptional items of ~$1.1 billion 
and operating cashflow of ~$837 million.
Group net cash at 31 December 2010, 
after taking account of the $674 million 
debt drawn, was $404 million (2009: $524 
million) including $217 million held by 
Cairn India.
The Board continues to focus the Group’s 
capital resources to maximise shareholder 
value and maintain financial and 
operational flexibility.

Academy provides his view on the industry. 
 
DR JULIAN FENNEMA

RETURN TO GROWTH
In 2010, the world economy started  
on the road to recovery from the worst 
recession since the Second World War, 
registering 5% GDP growth after a 
contraction in 2009
(1)
. Ongoing fragility  
in private demand constrained advanced 
economies to 3% growth, but the emerging 
and developing economies expanded  
by 7 .1%. This strong performance led  
to concerns of overheating in many 
economies, with competition for  
scarce resources driving up global 
commodities prices.
Brent crude also trended upwards, 
averaging $79.5/per barrel (bbl) in 2010, up 
from $61.7/bbl in 2009. This has continued 
in early 201 1, breaking through the $100/bbl  
per barrel mark at the end of January for  
the first time in three years, predominantly  
as a result of increased geo-political risk.
Global demand for oil products rose by 
3.2% to 87 .8 mmbopd in 2010
(2)
. This 
increase was partially due to the economic 
recovery in advanced economies but 
mainly driven by non-OECD
(3)
 economies 
such as China and India, where energy-
intensive industrial development and 
expanding transport services increased 
demand by in excess of 1 mb/d
(4)
. 
Expansions in supply did not keep pace 
with this demand growth through 2010, 
hence the tightening in price. Supply  
grew by 2.5% to 87 .3 mb/d
(5)
, this response 
being evenly shared between OPEC
(6)
 and 
non-OPEC sources, where the second  
was higher than expected given declining 
production in mature areas such as the 
North Sea and Mexico.
Historically, the gas price was linked to  
that of oil due to the lack of an open 
market and the need for long-term 
contracts to pay for expensive transport 
systems. The recent development of a 
global LNG infrastructure has brought 
about a disconnection between the  
two commodities which was reinforced  
in 2010. The upturn in economic growth,  
and linked demand for natural gas,  
did result in a modest increase of the  
gas price within the European market,  
but expansions in domestic supply  
led to continued falls in price in the  
United States
(7)
. 
EXPLORATION IN 2010
Exploration activity is vital to ensure a 
continued resource stock for exploitation, 
but exploration expenditure was squeezed 
in the aftermath of the financial crisis due 
to a high-cost environment and restricted 
cash flows. Despite the amelioration of 
these constraints through 2010, the total 
exploration expenditure, and number  
of completed wells, continued to fall.

  The increase in domestic supply in the US from the unconventional gas “revolution”,  
gas extracted from shale, tight sands or coalbeds, has driven prices down from  
c. $7 per thousand cubic feet in 2008 to c. $4 in 2010.
8
  As resource nationalism increasingly restricts the access of independent oil companies 
(non-government companies, from the IOCs to large and mid-cap) they need reserves 
in other areas. These are likely to be in remote, and often extreme, geographical 
locations or in deepwater, or from unconventional sources such as tar sands or shale 
deposits. Although technically more risky these projects offer more advantageous  
fiscal terms and hence maintain a risk-return relationship. The frontier is continually 
expanding due to technical innovation within the industry.
9
  A barrel of oil equivalent (boe) is the quantity of gas with the same energy content  
as one barrel of oil, allowing direct comparison of the size of oil and gas fields.
Given the long-term forecasts for continued demand  
growth, particularly from non-OECD economies, the oil  
and gas sector has seen the improved market outlook  
reflected in its stock prices.  
 
Despite mixed experiences, the sector valuation  
rose 32% over 2010, almost twice the increase of  
the wider market.

Overview
Business Review

Financial Statements
Additional Information
The suspension of drilling activity in the 
Gulf of Mexico in the aftermath of the 
Macondo incident was a key reason for  
this, as a major proportion of exploration 
activity by international oil companies 
(IOCs) was planned in this area last year. 
The imposed drilling moratorium also 
reinforced the strategic move by the large 
companies to diversify their resource base, 
with a reallocation of planned capital spend 
towards frontier exploration activity
(8)
. 
Despite the fall in expenditure, additions 
to reserves were at their highest since 
2000, estimated to have grown by over  
40 billion boe
(9)
. A small number of 
very significant finds in Brazil and Iran 
accounted for approximately 50% of this 
volume, but these reserves are owned by 
national oil companies (NOCs). There was 
only one recorded discovery in excess  
of 1 billion boe by an independent oil 
company, the Leviathan gas field in the 
Mediterranean off the coast of Israel.
In 2010, smaller, but still economically 
attractive, finds have been associated  
with exploration efforts in Australia, 
onshore former Soviet Union and in 
deepwater West Africa. The public  
profile of exploration in frontier areas such 
as East Africa, the Falkland Islands and 
Greenland was also significantly boosted. 
Despite the decline in overall activity, the 
availability of drilling rigs for exploration 
remained tight. While rigs could not be 
used in the Gulf of Mexico, they remained 
under contract and therefore were 
repositioned in other areas of the world. 
The supply of rigs is catching up with 
demand, easing conditions slightly in 2011, 
but demand is expected to remain buoyant 
and rental and utilisation rates high.
M&A MARKET REIGNITED
Exploration activity is not the only way, 
however, for companies to gain access  
to reserves, and 2010 saw an increase  
of 33% in the value of upstream M&A 
activity over the previous year, to $183 
billion. This reflected the easing of 
financial conditions but also the increased 
bullishness over long-term prices  
and the value of acquired reserves. 
The firms undertaking the acquisitions  
were mainly NOCs from countries with 
insufficient domestic resource bases.  
These included the cash-rich Chinese 
NOCs Sinopec and CNOOC investing 
heavily in North American projects, and  
the hostile takeover of the UK-based 
independent oil company, Dana Petroleum, 
by the South Korean NOC in September. 
The IOCs were net sellers as they  
sought to readjust their portfolio  
and to raise capital for new frontier 
developments, but some were also 
acquiring projects in order to acquire 
reserves to compensate for the success 
rates of their own exploration. For 
example, when ExxonMobil acquired  
XTO Energy in December 2009, this  
deal accounted for 80% of the increase  
in their reserves over the year.
SHAREHOLDER VALUE
Given the long-term forecasts for 
continued demand growth, particularly 
from non-OECD economies, the oil and 
gas sector has seen the improved market 
outlook reflected in its stock prices. 
Despite mixed experiences, the sector 
valuation rose 32% over 2010, almost  
twice the increase of the wider market.
Producing oil from a successful exploration 
effort is not the only way to generate 
shareholder value, however, as the previous 
section demonstrates. By identifying 
commercially viable reserves, exploration 
companies create a new asset with a market 
value derived from its future production 
potential. The company might choose to 
produce the reserves themselves, but may 
also generate returns by selling the asset. 
This avoids the complexity of bringing  
large finds into production, requiring 
significant upfront investment and, usually, 
joint ventures as a means of financing  
the development. 
This business model therefore represents  
a different value proposition from that of 
the larger integrated oil and gas company 
generating a stable stream of available cash 
to return to shareholders. Given that the 
size of the project relative to the size of  
the firm will tend to be high, it creates  
a sawtooth pattern of company value 
through the cycle of the project emerging, 
maturing and being sold to finance the next 
phase. The model is therefore focused on 
the potential for significant capital growth 
– an increase in the share value as the 
project matures – rather than a less volatile 
stream of dividend payments: higher risk, 
but with the potential for higher returns.

How we   
WORK
Cairn can only ever operate at the 
invitation of others. Its licence to do  
so depends on the Company’s ability  
to respect local cultures, respect the 
environment and bring lasting social  
and economic benefits to those Cairn 
works alongside.
From Cairn’s employees, contractors  
and suppliers to the local communities  
and environment where it operates,  
safety remains Cairn’s first priority. 
The Company takes great care to ensure 
that its operations have the minimal 
impact possible on the environment,  
carrying out assessments throughout any 
programme to measure what impact its 
activities might have. Wherever Cairn 
operates, its plans are reviewed by the 
regulatory bodies of the host nations.
Cairn runs programmes for local 
communities that aim to provide positive 
social and sustainable economic benefits.
A good example is the Dairy Development 
Programme set up by Cairn India in the 
Barmer district, also home to Cairn’s 
Rajasthan oil development.
Livestock breeding has long been  
the traditional subsistence method  
in western Rajasthan, yet the hostile  
terrain offers little opportunity to sell 
surplus milk, and a lack of technology  
for measuring and analysing the milk  
has meant that communities have  
been unable to command a fair price  
for what they could sell. The Dairy 
Development Programme was established 
to form a central body to collect milk  
and provide an assured buyer, while 
investment in technology now means  
that local people can achieve prices  
up to 25% higher than before.
In Greenland, Cairn worked with  
local training institutes and language 
centres in 2010, to train Greenlanders in 
English language skills to equip them to 
participate in future oil and gas activities 
or other international industries. Cairn  
also conducted an enterprise workshop, 
employs Greenlandic service providers 
wherever possible, and supported 
approximately $3 million of environmental 
research in Greenland. 
Cairn’s approach in Greenland will follow 
that which it has pursued in Rajasthan and 
Bangladesh. Should Cairn successfully find 
significant quantities of hydrocarbons, the 
Company will support local people through 
a number of relevant, targeted and 
sustainable initiatives.
As an entrepreneurial company, Cairn has demonstrated  
many times how quick decision making and the ability to form 
strong and lasting relationships has benefitted all stakeholders.

GROUP PRODUCTION
Cairn’s average gross production during 
2010 was 130,961 barrels of oil equivalent 
per day (boepd) which represents an 
increase of 70% from daily production  
in 2009 (2009: 77 ,222* boepd). The 
Group’s average entitlement production 
for 2010 was 65,299 boepd net to  
Cairn (2009: 20,307* boepd) which  
is a 222% increase.
The figures in the table opposite show 
group production for 2010 on a gross, 
working interest and entitlement interest 
basis (including 100% of both CIL’s and 
Capricorn’s production).
The average realised price per boe for 
2010 was $69.17 (2009: $50.02). Cairn’s 
current entitlement interest production  
is 95% oil: 5% gas.
*  Includes Rajasthan boepd production for 125 days.
GROUP BOOKED 2P RESERVES
The table opposite shows reserves 
information at 31 December 2010 on  
an entitlement interest basis for the  
Group (including 100% of both CIL’s and 
Capricorn’s reserves). For accounting and 
reserves purposes, the Group has used  
an oil price assumption of $75/bbl for  
2011 (real) (2009: $65/bbl for 2010 (real)).
On a direct working interest basis,  
proven plus probable (2P) reserves as  
at 31 December 2010 have decreased  
by 27 .1 million barrels of oil equivalent 
(mmboe) to 315.7 mmboe (31 December 
2009: 342.8 mmboe). The net entitlement 
reserves position has also decreased  
by 28.9 mmboe from 253.9 mmboe to 
225.0 mmboe. The Group’s reserves are  
now all in India following the sale of its 
interests in Bangladesh in December 2010.
The Group’s net entitlement interest to 
reserves is significantly geared to the oil 
price assumption used and the potential 
movement in reserves at different 
long-term oil prices is shown opposite.
Figures include 100% of CIL’s and 
Capricorn’s production and reserves.

Additional Information
The well results from Bhagyam drilling have 
so far met expectations. 
As a result of an increase in the estimated 
reserves and resources, an assessment  
of the plateau production potential and 
design optimisation of the Aishwariya field 
facilities is currently underway. Production 
is currently scheduled to commence in  
H2 2012, subject to obtaining all the 
necessary approvals.
Cairn India and its JV partner ONGC 
continue to develop the hydrocarbon 
resources in the state of Rajasthan with  
a continued focus on cost and the 
application of innovative technologies. 
Midstream (pipeline) 
The already-constructed MPT to Salaya 
section (~590km) of the pipeline and 
associated facilities continue to safely 
deliver crude oil to various buyers. 
Construction work on the final ~80km 
Salaya to Bhogat section of the pipeline 
and the Bhogat terminal and marine 
facilities are under way, with completion 
targeted for H2 2012.
In 2010, more than 22 mmbbls of crude oil 
were safely delivered through the pipeline. 
The pipeline system availability is currently 
at 98.7%, achieved within six months  
of start-up. 
Crude – sales
The implied crude price realisation 
represents an average 10-15% discount to 
Brent on the basis of prices prevailing for 
the twelve months to December 2010. 
Sales arrangements are in place for 
143,000 bopd with PSU and private 
refiners and discussions continue with  
the GoI for further nominations. 
Resource base including enhanced  
oil recovery (EOR)
The MBA fields have gross recoverable  
oil reserves and resources of over 1 billion 
barrels, which include 2P gross reserves 
and resources of 694 mmboe with a 
further 300 mmboe or more of EOR 
resource potential. The MBA fields will 
contribute more than 20% of India’s 
domestic crude production when they 
reach the currently approved plateau  
rate of 175,000 bopd.
The first phase of the EOR pilot,  
consisting of the drilling and completion  
of four injectors, one producer and three 
observation wells and their hook-up to  
the facilities, has already been completed. 
The water injection and production phase 
commenced in December 2010.
A pilot hydraulic fracturing programme  
to test the potential of the Barmer Hill 
Formation is planned, subject to GoI 
approval. The pilot programme will  
allow evaluation of the appropriate cost- 
effective technology for a fully-optimised 
development of this low-permeability  
oil resource base. A declaration of 
commerciality for Barmer Hill was 
submitted to the GoI in March 2010  
and a FDP is under preparation.
Exploration
Cairn India has a total of 10 blocks in its 
portfolio in three strategically-focused 
areas, namely one block in Rajasthan, 
three on the west coast of India and six  
on the east coast of India, including one  
in Sri Lanka. Out of these, eight, including 
the three producing blocks, are operated 
by Cairn India. Activities are ongoing at 
different stages in the exploration blocks. 
Over the years, Cairn India has optimised 
its exploration portfolio by adding new 
prospective blocks and relinquishing 
some, but has continued to increase its  
net unrisked potential resource base.
The MBA fields have gross recoverable oil reserves  
and resources of over 1 billion barrels, which includes  
2P gross reserves and resources of 694 mmboe,  
with a further 300 mmboe or more of enhanced  
oil recovery (EOR) resource potential.

(comprising an average oil/condensate 
production of 7 ,344 bopd and average  
gas production of 29 mmscfd). To date,  
the asset has produced more than  
200 billion cubic feet of gas and 11 mmbbls 
of commingled oil (crude and condensate). 
GREENLAND
Subject to approval from the Government 
of Greenland, Cairn is planning to carry 
out an exploration drilling programme  
of up to four exploration wells offshore 
Greenland in the summer of 2011.  
This programme follows on from the  
2010 three well exploration programme 
offshore west Greenland in the Baffin Bay 
basin. While drilling operations ceased at 
the beginning of October in accordance 
with the Greenland Government’s 
regulations, Cairn has now been operating 
offshore Greenland (recently acquiring 
environmental survey data) for thirteen 
consecutive months, which demonstrates 
the ability to be able to work all through 
the year in this area.
The 2010 exploration campaign was 
focused on safety, and following the  
Gulf of Mexico incident, Cairn reviewed  
its exploration programme, with the  
full participation of the Greenland 
Government. The 2010 plan included:
Contracting two state-of-the-art 
‘dynamically positioned’ fifth- and  
sixth-generation vessels to explore 
simultaneously, allowing almost 
immediate drilling of a relief well as  
a back-up should this be necessary;
Designing the drilling schedule so that 
only one rig entered a hydrocarbon-
bearing section at any given time;
A well design with primary and 
secondary barriers to minimise the 
possibility of an uncontrolled release  
of hydrocarbons, which was reviewed 
by an independent external expert in 
accordance with North Sea practice;

For reasons of operational flexibility, 
evaluation efforts are focused on 
maintaining between 10 and 12 separate 
potential exploration well locations in a 
variety of operating environments and 
geological settings for as long as possible. 
At the time of going to print, the prospect 
inventory is being finalised for the various 
target options in the different locations. 
Unrisked mean prospective resource 
potential ranges from 0.35 billion to  
> 1 billion barrels contingent resource 
potential for each prospect. The final 
selection of prospects and well targets  
for the proposed 2011 exploration 
campaign will be made in May 2011.  
These will include a well in each of the 
Atammik and Lady Franklin blocks. 
The 2011 drilling programme will  
once again utilise a dual rig strategy  
with an emphasis on safety as well  
as providing increased operational 
capability and flexibility. The primary 
vessel, the ‘Ocean Rig Corcovado,’ is a 
‘state-of-the-art’ high-efficiency, sixth-
generation dynamically positioned 
drillship. The second vessel, the ‘Leiv 
Eiriksson’, is a fifth-generation dynamically 
positioned semi-submersible. Both rigs 
are designed and equipped for working  
in harsh environments. 
A number of other vessels have been 
selected to provide additional operational 
support including cover for emergency 
response, rig stand-by, ice management, 
oil spill response, re-supply operations 
and helicopter support. Negotiations  
are ongoing with a wide range of oilfield 
service contractors to provide the 
necessary support for the 2011  
exploration programme.
Cairn also plans to undertake a 3D seismic 
acquisition programme in Greenland 
during 2011, subject to the necessary 
approvals. Two 3D seismic survey vessels 
are expected to be contracted to acquire 
up to three 3D surveys in different areas.
Cairn also plans to implement, subject  
to the required approvals, three shallow  
(~400 metres) marine soil investigations  
to obtain critical stratigraphic information. 
These will be drilled in the north of Baffin 
Bay, the Disko area and offshore south 
Greenland.
West Disko blocks
Cairn continues to evaluate the results  
of its 2010 exploration campaign on  
the Sigguk Block in the Disko Bay area.  
The wells found both gas (biogenic  
and thermogenic) and oil (geochemical 
evaluation having now identified three oil 
types), although significant target reservoir 
rocks were not encountered. The Alpha-1S1 
exploration well was suspended to allow 
possible re-entry to sidetrack or deepen 
the well at a later date.

three blocks: Ingoraq, Napariaq and Pitu. 
Other recipients of block awards included 
Shell, Statoil, GDF, Conoco-Phillips  
and Maersk.
Atammik and Lady Franklin blocks
In January 201 1, the Government of 
Greenland confirmed Cairn as the Operator 
of the Atammik and Lady Franklin blocks, 
and Cairn has acquired the 47 .5% interest 
previously held by Encana. The participating 
interests in these two blocks are now Cairn

REVIEW
The financial strategy of the Group  
remains focused on maintaining the 
Balance Sheet strength to allow us to  
invest in our exploration and development 
opportunities. With completion of the first 
phase of the development of the MPT in 
Rajasthan and the associated pipeline the 
Group’s cash flow generation has increased 
over six fold this year, and Cairn India is set 
to continue to grow its operating cash flow.
At 31 December 2010, Cairn had net  
cash of $404 million (2009: $524 million). 
Cairn India had net cash of $217 million, 
comprising $891 million and $674 million 
debt. PLC/Capricorn’s cash balances  
were $187 million, with no debt drawn.
PRESENTATION OF RESULTS – 
IMPACT OF VEDANTA TRANSACTION
As at the Balance Sheet date 31 December 
2010, the transaction to sell to Vedanta 
a majority stake in Cairn India had already 
been announced and was considered, 
under IFRS, highly probable. As a result, 
the financial results of Cairn India are 
shown as discontinued operations in the 
Group Income Statement, and its assets 
and liabilities are reflected as held-for-sale 
in the Group Balance Sheet. The sale of 
our Bangladesh operations has also been 
reflected as discontinued operations.
Before taking account of the adjustments associated with the 
Vedanta transaction, the Group made a profit after tax before 
exceptional items of $483 million (2009 restated: $43 million). 
This increases to $1.1 billion if these adjustments are included.

Additional Information
As a consequence of our interest in Cairn 
India being classified as held-for-sale, two 
accounting adjustments were required 
which have had an impact on the Income 
Statement. The first adjustment is the 
treatment of charges for depletion, 
depreciation and amortisation. From  
16 August 2010, the date on which the 
transaction was announced, no further  
such charges have been made, the impact 
of which has been to increase reported 
profits by $193 million. The second is the 
accounting for deferred tax. Previously, 
deferred tax was provided on the basis that 
the carrying value of the net assets would 
be recovered through use in the continuing 
business, which would pay tax on its profits 
in due course. In these accounts, deferred 
tax is provided on the basis that the 
carrying value of the net assets will be 
recovered through the sale of our interest  
in Cairn India. As the accounting carrying 
value is significantly lower than the tax base  
of the assets deductible against the sale 
proceeds, the result is a credit to the 
Income Statement of $445 million.
The overall impact on the Income 
Statement is an increase in reported  
profit after tax of $638 million.
The Vedanta transaction is currently 
awaiting GoI approval. The proceeds, gain 
on sale and related tax charges arising from 
this transaction will not be recognised in the 
accounts until such time as all contractual 
conditions between Cairn and Vedanta, 
including receipt of all necessary approvals, 
are satisfied. 
While the accounting adjustments  
noted above are required to comply  
with our financial reporting obligations, 
the Board has monitored the performance 
of the Group throughout the year by 
reference to the underlying results of  
each operating segment, i.e. as if Cairn 
India was a continuing business of the 
Group and so ignoring the adjustments  
to depletion, depreciation, amortisation 
and deferred tax.
For clarity, the table above shows the results 
of the Group on a continuing basis and 
before exceptional items. The adjustments 
noted and the exceptional items are shown 
separately, and reconcile profit after tax  
on a continuing basis and profit after tax as 
reported. The commentary in this financial 
review is provided on the continuing basis, 
unless stated otherwise.
PRODUCTION, REVENUE AND  
GROSS PROFIT 
All numbers are stated before the impact 
of exceptional items.
Group oil and gas revenues for the  
year were ~$1.6 billion, compared with 
$234 million in 2009. Average entitlement 
production increased to 65,299  
boepd (2009: 13,803 boepd), of which  
oil production accounted for 95%  
(2009: 71%). Production costs also  
rose to $259 million from $53 million. 
The significant increases in revenue and 
production reflect the contribution made 
by the Rajasthan field which in May 2010 
saw the milestone of first oil through the 
pipeline from Mangala. In the last quarter 
of the financial year, gross daily production 
averaged 124,861 bopd, in line with the 
currently approved plateau production rate.
The Group’s blended average price 
realised was $69.17 compared to $50.02  
in 2009. Rajasthan crude realised an 
average price of $70.86 per bbl for  
the year (2009: $65.48 per bbl).
Production costs include the cost of 
trucking oil from Rajasthan to Kandla  
port until May, when the primary  
delivery method was switched to the 
pipeline from MPT to Salaya. Due to  
the significant increase in volumes,  
the Group’s average production cost  
of $11.49 per boe (2009: $12.31 per boe) 
primarily reflects the operating cost  
of the Mangala field. This includes  
CESS at 2,500 Rupees per tonne (~$7 .50 
per bbl at current exchange rates) levied 
on Rajasthan production. Cairn India is 
currently disputing the obligation to pay 
this through arbitration.

The majority of the unsuccessful exploration 
costs of $235 million (2009: $57 million) 
relate to the Greenland drilling campaign. 
The T8-1 and T4-1 wells did not result in 
commercial discoveries; consequently  
the well costs, including all associated 
demobilisation and other costs have been 
written off in accordance with Cairn’s 
accounting policies. The primary objectives 
of the Alpha prospect were not reached,  
the well has been suspended and any future 
re-entry work depends on the results of 
further evaluation. These costs, totalling 
$203 million, have not been written off.
Depletion and decommissioning charges, 
on a continuing operations basis, have 
increased from $60 million to $352 million 
and the charge per boe has increased  
from $11.92 per boe to $14.79 per boe. 
Both increases are as a result of Rajasthan 
production. The depletion and 
decommissioning rate per boe is calculated 
using booked reserves. In Rajasthan, if the 
planned EOR and Barmer Hill trials are 
successful we would expect to increase the 
Group’s booked reserves. Consequently, 
the depletion and decommissioning rate 
per boe would decrease accordingly.
Gross profit for the year was $741 million 
(2009 restated: $42 million).
RESULTS FOR THE YEAR
All numbers are stated before the impact 
of exceptional items.
Administrative expenses include non-cash 
charges for share-based payments of  
$29 million (2009: $24 million) and for 
depreciation and amortisation of $10 
million (2009: $8 million). Net of these 
charges, administrative expenses have 
increased to $66 million (2009: $57 million).
Impairment charges of $16 million relate  
to the Group’s Mediterranean operations. 
The Group recognised an accounting  
loss of $9 million on the disposal of our 
Bangladesh operations and a gain on the 
sale of our interest in Papua New Guinea 
of $13 million.
Net finance costs for the year were  
$58 million (2009: $11 million income). 
From April 2010, a proportion of interest 
charges incurred on the debt associated 
with the Rajasthan development were no 
longer capitalised following completion  
of the additional processing trains  
and pipeline.
The Group’s current tax charge for the year 
is $253 million (2009 restated: $36 million) 
and mainly reflects Indian corporate tax  
on the profits from the Mangala field.  
The deferred tax credit for the year is  
$604 million (2009 restated: $106 million). 
This is due to a change in the basis of 
calculation for the Cairn India Group, 
previously a continuing use basis and  
now, as a result of the Vedanta transaction, 
on a held-for-sale basis.
Before taking account of the adjustments 
associated with the Vedanta transaction, 
the Group made a profit after tax  
before exceptional items of $483 million 
(2009 restated: $43 million). This increases 
to $1.1 billion if these adjustments are 
included.
EXCEPTIONAL ITEMS 
Ravva Arbitration
The calculation of the GoI’s share of 
petroleum produced from the Ravva field 
in earlier years has been disputed for some 
years. In January 2009, the GoI instructed 
the buyers of the Ravva crude not to pass 
over the revenues to Cairn until such time 
as they believed that the liability had been 
settled in full. In 2009, Cairn provided for 
the full $96 million liability, and this has 
been collected by the GoI by withholding 
revenues. Cairn continues to seek 
resolution of the dispute and recovery  
of these revenues through legal channels. 
In 2010, additional interest charges of  
~$1 million have been provided for.

Share-based payments
In December 2009, Cairn’s shareholders 
approved the conversion of notional 
“Units” in the Capricorn Group awarded  
in 2007 and 2008 into incentives over 
Cairn Energy PLC shares. Consequently, 
$38 million has been recognised in the 
Income Statement as a result of this 
modification (2009: $30 million). The  
final charge relating to this share scheme 
conversion will be incurred in the first  
half of the 2011 financial year. 
CASH FLOW, CAPITAL INVESTMENT 
AND LIQUIDITY
Cash inflow from operating activities  
was $837 million (2009: $111 million). 
Whilst operating cash flows in 2009 were 
impacted by the GoI withholding Ravva 
revenues, 2010 operating cash flows have 
still increased significantly as a result of the 
contribution made by the Rajasthan field. 
Significant inflows during the year arose 
from the receipt of $64 million proceeds 
from the disposal of a 10% interest in  
Cairn’s operated Greenland licences to 
PETRONAS, which completed in February 
2010. The Group also earned interest of $44 
million during the year (2009: $39 million).
Cash outflow on capital expenditure is set 
out in the table below.
Exploration/appraisal expenditure in 2010 
includes costs of the Greenland drilling 
programme, the well costs in Tunisia and 
the Group’s share of the non-operated 
drilling campaign in the KG basin offshore 
India. Development expenditure in 2010 
primarily relates to the Rajasthan 
development. 
During the year, Cairn India refinanced  
its existing INR facility by raising INR 
22,500 million (approximately $500 million) 
through INR Unsecured Non-convertible 
Debentures. This access to the Indian 
Debt Capital Market is a first for Cairn 
India, which received subscription from  
a wide range of investors consisting of 
mutual funds and insurance companies. 
Total debt facilities for Cairn India are now 
~$1,250 million of which ~$576 million 
remained undrawn at the year end.
To provide the liquidity required to enable 
the Group to agree contracts for two  
state-of-the-art drilling vessels for its 2011 
dual rig exploration programme offshore 
Greenland, Cairn also entered into a 
stand-by secured revolving debt facility  
of $900 million. The facility can also  
be used for general corporate purposes.
At 31 December 2010, Cairn had net  
cash of $404 million (2009: $524 million). 
Cairn India had net cash of $217 million, 
comprising $891 million and $674 million 
debt. PLC/Capricorn’s cash balances were 
$187 million, with no debt drawn.
GOING CONCERN
The directors have considered the  
financial and operational risks relevant  
to support a statement of going concern. 
The Group’s liquidity is carefully and 
routinely monitored, with scenarios run for 
different assumptions, including oil price 
and production rates. The directors have a 
reasonable expectation that the Group has 
adequate financial resources to continue in 
operational existence for the foreseeable 
future, and therefore continue to adopt  
the going concern basis in preparing the 
financial statements.
OUTLOOK
The Board continues to focus the Group’s 
capital and human resources to maximise 
shareholder value and maintain financial 
and operational flexibility. 
Our focus on value remains our top 
priority, and completion of the transaction 
with Vedanta would provide the funding to 
continue a multi-year programme offshore 
Greenland, return a substantial proportion 
of the proceeds to shareholders and 
consider other portfolio management 
opportunities. By retaining a significant 
stake in Cairn India, the Group will also 
retain exposure to the future potential  
in this growing business. 
The proposed return of capital to 
shareholders is in keeping with our long 
held strategy of creating and realising 
value for shareholders.

AND UNCERTAINTIES
MANAGING BUSINESS RISKS
Getting risk management right is an 
essential component of business success 
at Cairn. The identification, evaluation  
and management of risk, together with  
the way we respond to changes in the 
external operating environment, are  
key to our success and underpin the  
safe delivery of our business plans and 
strategic objectives, protect our licence  
to operate and reputation, and help  
create long-term competitive advantage. 
In pursuing its strategy, Cairn considers 
investment opportunities that provide  
the right mix of political, commercial and 
technical risks. Cairn’s success in South  
Asia over the past twenty-plus years has 
been achieved through confidence in our 
technical and commercial acumen and the 
ability to identify, assess and effectively 
manage uncertainties. We knowingly 
accept business risks which are appropriate 
for the component parts of our business 
in pursuit of our vision. 
Risk management is embedded in  
Cairn’s organisation structure, operations 
and management systems. Business  
risks across the Group are addressed  
in a systematic way through the risk 
management structure shown here 
which ensures that the Board’s assessment  
of risk is informed by risk factors and 
mitigating controls originating from 
and identified by the Group’s assets, 
functional departments and in-country 
operations, including Cairn India,  
the Company’s majority owned  
subsidiary in India.

RESPONSIBILITY  
Responsible behaviour is integral to Cairn’s activities. As one  
of Europe’s largest independent oil and gas companies, we 
aim to create sustainable value for all our stakeholders through 
exploring for, and providing, an essential source of energy, 
while simultaneously safeguarding the environment and 
respecting and contributing to the communities in which  
we operate. This is at the heart of our business strategy.
An overview of Cairn’s approach to 
managing Corporate Responsibility  
(CR) and a summary of 2010 performance 
is provided in the following section. For 
the last ten years, Cairn has also issued  
a separate report with more details on  
its approach to CR management and 
performance data; and since 2009, this has 
been provided electronically on the Cairn 
website. Cairn’s 2010 CR report is available  
at www.cairnenergy.com/CRR2010. 
Environmental Resource Management 
(ERM) has also provided limited assurance 
of selected subject matters within the 
contents of the 2010 CR Report and a 
statement of their findings is available  
on this site.
2010 CR OVERVIEW
We reached our initial production 
target of 125,000 bopd from the 
Mangala field in Rajasthan in June 2010 
and sales started through the 600km 
Barmer-Salaya crude oil pipeline. Prior 
to this, crude was transported via road 
tankers and consequently the pipeline 
is contributing to reducing the risk of 
road accidents and greenhouse gas 
(GHG) emissions associated with 
transporting our product to market.
Initiatives continued in Rajasthan to 
assist in providing access to water for 
local people, while we also continued 
funding schemes to improve health

to help assure farmers of a new, year 
round income, and the Enterprise 
Centre, where local people have  
learned new skills.
Regrettably, there were two fatalities 
among contractors working in Rajasthan 
and three members of the public were 
involved in fatal traffic accidents with 
vehicles driven by contractors. These 
tragic incidents were fully investigated, 
and corrective steps taken with the 
contractors concerned, to minimise  
their likelihood of happening again.
Permission was secured to drill up to 
four new wells offshore Greenland; the 
first for ten years. The application was 
supported by detailed environmental 
and social impact assessments, during 
which 74 consultation meetings and  
4 public hearings were held.

Three offshore exploration wells  
were drilled in Greenland in 2010 
without environmental incidents and 
only one lost time incident, on an  
ice management vessel. An offshore 
exploration well was also drilled  
in Tunisia with no accidents or 
environmental incidents.
An Impact Benefit Agreement (IBA)  
was signed with Greenlandic National 
and Municipal authorities which 
included commitments to support 
education, promote local participation, 
infrastructure and environmental 
research in Greenland.
Cairn’s CR Policies, Business Principles 
and CR Management System were

OUR CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY 
PRIORITIES
The complexity and scale of our business 
raises a number of CR matters at local, 
national and international levels. 
During 2010, we concentrated on 10  
CR-related areas:
Stakeholder engagement
Business ethics
Continual improvement 
Environmental impact
Climate change
Employee development 
Labour practices 
Health and safety
Community development
Human rights
We address these priorities through 
responsible business practices, which are 
underpinned by our CR Policies, Business 
Principles and CR Management System.
OUR APPROACH TO CORPORATE 
RESPONSIBILITY 
Our approach to corporate responsibility 
is about how we manage the interaction 
between financial growth, the environment 
and society. This is based on the 
expectations of our shareholders and 
other stakeholders in relation to our 
financial performance, as well as risk 
management and wider environmental 
and societal concerns. 
Our Business Principles describe our key 
principles and approach to managing the 
business which are based on our three 
Core Values, known as the 3Rs:
Respect: for people, communities,  
the environment, the rule of law and 
human rights.
Relationships: we believe that building 
strong, open and lasting relationships 
with our stakeholders is not merely  
a social responsibility, but vital to 
achieving our business goals.
Responsibility: we recognise our 
responsibility to ensure our actions  
do not harm people, the environment 
or society.
CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY 
(CONTINUED)
Our approach to corporate responsibility is about how  
we manage the interaction between financial growth,  
society and the environment. 41

The Business Principles are implemented 
by all directors, officers and employees of 
the Cairn Group and subsidiary companies, 
and others who work on our behalf, in 
accordance with our CR Policies.
These 3Rs and the Business Principles  
are promoted to staff, partners, suppliers 
and contractors. The CR Policies and

Cairn’s Group CR Policies, which  
cover Health, Safety and Security (HSS), 
Environment and Corporate Social 
Responsibility (CSR) are statements 
of intent and commitments towards CR. 
To support the delivery of these 
commitments, we implement  
a Group Corporate Responsibility 
Management System (CRMS), which is 
supported by detailed procedures and 
guidelines. Applying the Group CRMS  
to all our business activities is essential  
in maintaining our ‘licence to operate’  
and building our business reputation.
In 2010, we reviewed and updated  
our CRMS to ensure that it continued  
to effectively deliver our policies and 
Business Principles, and ensure it  
remains consistent with good practice  
and international standards.
Through the CRMS, we aim to recognise 
and manage potential CR impacts, and 
encourage a culture of openness and 
continuous improvement.
CR GOVERNANCE
The Board has overall responsibility for 
defining Group CR Policies and Business 
Principles, and maintaining and seeking 
improvement to the Group’s CR 
performance. It also ensures that effective 
policies and management systems are in 
place to manage CR risks in the business.
Day-to-day responsibility for implementing 
the business management system lies with 
the executive directors, while the Chief 
Executive’s Committee (CEC) reviews  
and agrees strategy.
The CEC is advised on CR matters by the 
Group CR Committee, which is chaired by 
the Deputy Chief Executive, and comprises 
executive directors and key heads of 
department. The Group CR Committee 
regularly reviews Cairn’s CR Policies, 
Business Principles and management 
systems, CR performance, and CR risks and 
mitigation measures. CR risks are also fed 
into the business risk management process.
The Risk Management Committee (RMC) 
is responsible for ensuring an effective 
business risk management system on 
behalf of the Board. To achieve this, it 
receives regular updates on risk matrices 
and registers from the appropriate project, 
asset, country and corporate departments. 
Cairn India
Since 2007 , Cairn Group’s activities in  
India have been managed by Cairn India. 
Cairn India has an integrated internal 
control and assurance framework, 
overseen by the Cairn India Board,  
and receives regular updates on CR 
matters and performance. 42 Cairn Energy PLC Annual Report 2010
Capricorn
The Group manages the business  
outside of Cairn India, including its 
operations in Greenland, Albania, Spain 
and Nepal, through its unlisted, wholly-
owned subsidiary Capricorn. Cairn’s 
strategy for Capricorn is delivered by an 
asset-led matrix organisation, applying  
a business management system that 
includes CR, technical, financial and 
operational procedures.
STAKEHOLDER ENGAGEMENT
The importance of developing strong 
relationships with our stakeholders is 
enshrined in our Business Principles. By 
engaging with stakeholders, canvassing 
their views and understanding their needs, 
we can act as a responsible business,  
well placed to achieve our goals. 
Guidance on stakeholder engagement  
is given by the Group Guidelines for 
Stakeholder Management. These help  
all country, asset and project managers  
to identify and assess stakeholders,  
and develop engagement strategies.
Engagement strategies for every project 
are defined within Public Consultation and 
Disclosure Plans (PCDPs). In 2010, PCDPs 
were completed in Tunisia and Greenland 
to reflect our drilling activities during the 
year, and the PCDP for Greenland will  
be updated again in 2011 to reflect the 
proposed exploration programme for  
the coming year.
Additionally, in Greenland, as part of the 
process to gain approval for our 2010 
drilling programme from the Greenlandic 
Government, Cairn carried out both an 
Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) 
and a Social Impact Assessment (SIA).  
Both were subject to public hearings.  
The public were invited to submit their 
comments and concerns about the project, 
and Cairn provided written responses  
to the Greenlandic Government for every 
comment raised by the process, prior to 
approval being granted.
OUR PROGRESS IN 2010
Cairn invests in projects at different stages 
in the value chain, from the early stages of 
exploration through to production, and in 
vastly different operating environments, 
from the deserts of Rajasthan in India  
to the waters around Greenland.
We use materiality reviews to identify  
and communicate the key CR issues  
which are relevant to our business and  
our stakeholders. The issues faced in  
each location are very different, and  
their relevance to our stakeholders varies 
considerably. The materiality process is 
therefore an amalgam of different views 
and represents an attempt to define a 
complex position for the Group as a whole. 
Full details of our latest materiality analysis 
are available in the 2010 CR Report.
Through this process we identified  
a number of key CR issues and each  
is described in more detail in the  
following sections.
Cairn India 
CR is integral to the way Cairn India 
operates and the Company works closely 
with local communities to ensure they  
are active partners in its activities.
2010 saw the amicable closing of all  
land acquisitions claims that arose from 
the development of the first phase of  
the Barmer-Salaya pipeline. Cairn India 
ensured that all relevant stakeholders  
were kept informed about developments 
with an effective grievance system in place 
that includes a compensation package.

Additional Information
Cairn India also completed projects 
focused on access to water and improved 
healthcare and education, and a variety  
of enterprise initiatives designed to help 
local communities.
Ensuring the security of Cairn India’s 
installations, sites, pipelines and other 
assets in India, particularly those located  
in Rajasthan, is a key requirement. The 
provision of trained security guards, 
implementation of other preventative 
measures and maintenance of good 
community relations has been critical  
in minimising the potential for theft  
or damage to the facilities.
Greenland 
In 2010, Cairn drilled the first wells 
offshore Greenland for ten years. In total, 
Cairn now has interests in 11 exploration 
licence areas offshore Greenland.
Operating in this remote environment 
presents specific challenges. These range 
from the health and safety issues associated 
with operating in harsh weather conditions, 
to meeting the expectations of local people, 
minimising potential environmental impacts 
and improving opportunities for local 
participation in our activities.
From first expressing our interest in 
exploring offshore Greenland to receiving 
drilling approval, we have worked closely 
with the Government of Greenland to 
prioritise social and environmental 
protection. We have also worked to ensure 
that effective CR management mitigates  
or minimises any risks or potential impacts 
connected to our activities. In keeping with 
our approach to each new drilling project 
we undertook independent EIAs and SIAs. 
Legal and regulatory compliance 
Cairn’s activities are subject to compliance 
with a number of international and national 
laws and conventions, internal policy and 
performance standard requirements and 
voluntary codes and best practices. These 
are all detailed in our Business Principles 
and ensuring compliance to them is a  
key goal.
In addition, applications to carry out 
activities, whether seismic, drilling, 
construction or oil production, are subject 
to host government and/or local authority 
approval wherever we work. These 
approvals usually come with a number  
of operating conditions.
To ensure we meet these conditions, in 
accordance with our management system, 
we compile compliance registers and 
regularly monitor compliance throughout 
our operations.
Health and safety
Working in the oil and gas industry carries 
inherent potential risks. An essential 
element of our CRMS is to assess the 
health and safety risks associated with our 
activities, implement effective controls,  
set objectives and monitor performance.
Our employees, at all levels, are crucial to 
ensuring the successful implementation  
of our health and safety policies. We are 
committed to eliminating all work-related 
injuries and illnesses and protecting our 
employees and contractors through a 
comprehensive and proactive approach  
to health and safety.
However, despite these efforts, 2010
saw in Rajasthan two fatalities among 
contractors working on our sites and three 
among members of the public during fatal
traffic accidents involving our contractor
vehicles. These tragic incidents were fully 
investigated, and corrective steps taken 
with the contractors concerned, to minimise 
their likelihood of happening again. 
The importance of developing strong relationships with  
our stakeholders is enshrined in our Business Principles.  
By engaging with stakeholders, canvassing their views and 
understanding their needs, we can act as a responsible 
business, well placed to achieve our goals.  44 Cairn Energy PLC Annual Report 2010
Local residents, Barmer, Rajasthan
Road traffic has been significantly reduced 
since the opening of the pipeline from the 
MPT but we are still constantly reviewing 
our road safety plans. Recent initiatives 
include a Road Safety Task Force, revision 
of our Road Safety Policy and guidance 
document, continuous engagement  
with vehicle contractors, defensive  
driving training for both contractors  
and employees, and a recognition  
and reward scheme for drivers.
We also measure our Health, Safety  
and Environment (HSE) performance  
in line with the OGP* KPIs for health and 
safety. The key indicators are Lost Time 
Injury Frequency Rate (LTIFR) and Total 
Recordable Injury Rate (TRIR). 
With the completion of the first 3 trains at 
MPT and the pipeline to Salaya, the total 
number of staff and contractor hours in 
Cairn’s group-wide activities declined by 
40% from 71.9 million hours in 2009 to 43.3 
million hours in 2010. Cairn Group’s 2010 
LTIFR was 0.42 (2009: 0.26), an increase 
over 2009, but lower than in the wider 
upstream oil and gas industry as reported 
by OGP (2009: 0.45).
Cairn (excluding Cairn India) recorded  
an LTIFR of 0.60 and a TRIR of 1.81, while 
Cairn India recorded an LTIFR of 0.40  
and a TRIR of 1.55. The safety indicators 
have increased over 2009 and reflect  
the increased activity in 2010 in Cairn 
(excluding Cairn India), with seismic 
operations in Greenland and Bangladesh 
and well operations in Greenland and 
Tunisia. In Cairn India the increase in  
LTIs were mainly due to road accidents 
involving contractors. We will be striving  
to improve our safety performance and 
that of our contractors in 2011. 
Preventing major accidents
The Deepwater Horizon incident in the 
Gulf of Mexico in 2010 has, among other 
things, meant that there is increased 
awareness of the potential impacts  
of oil exploration there.
Our risk management systems are key  
to identifying potential major accident 
hazards and mitigating these hazards 
throughout the design and operation of 
our activities. Major projects are subject  
to a ‘gated review’ process. This process 
enables the review of project plans and 
risk management at pre-defined stages  
of the project, from concept to execution 
and close-out. 
Loss of well control is an example of a  
key potential major hazard when drilling. 
Special attention is therefore paid to 
assessing and assuring that the right 
mitigation measures are in place. This 
includes a hazard identification exercise 
(HAZID) for the well control programme 
and an audit of well control competencies 
through both Cairn and contractor 
personnel. 
Other measures deployed for the offshore 
Greenland programme included:
a dual rig strategy, that provided for 
two rigs to provide relief well capability 
at any time if it had been required
peer review by independent external 
experts
well defined ice monitoring and 
management procedures
independently audited and fully tested 
BOPs
an integrated drilling team with 
extensive experience operating in 
remote and challenging offshore 
locations
multiple well isolation devices
A variety of exercises were implemented 
throughout the programme to test 
emergency procedures and test reaction 
times for this critical area.
CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY

Cairn is committed to protecting the health and sustainability 
of the locations in which we operate, as enshrined in one of  
our Business Principles.

These were backed up with spill contingency 
plans, which were extensively resourced 
both with high-quality equipment and highly 
experienced response specialists.
At the end of the 2010 Greenland  
drilling programme, a ‘lessons learned’ 
exercise was undertaken to ensure areas 
for improvement were identified and 
included in the planning for the 2011 
drilling programme.
Business ethics
We operate in some countries with a 
relatively low ranking on the Transparency 
International Corruptions Perceptions Index. 
As a result, we need to be particularly 
vigilant about corruption and ensure we 
operate with the highest standards of 
integrity at all times. We expect all of our 
employees to maintain high standards of 
personal and professional integrity and we 
also have procurement controls to ensure 
fairness and integrity in the placing of 
contracts for goods and services.
In 2010, we further updated our  
anti-bribery and corruption management 
system, processes and procedures, 
including our Group Code of Business 
Ethics, and ran a series of workshops to 
raise awareness of the requirements of  
the new UK Bribery Act. 
Human rights
Respect for human rights is one of our 
defined Business Principles. We seek to 
apply the principles contained within the 
Universal Declaration of Human Rights 
(UDHR) within our sphere of influence 
and activities. This includes the rights of 
employees and those who are affected 
by our activities.
Meeting our responsibility to respect 
human rights is critical to the development 
and maintenance of effective relationships 
with our workers and the communities 
in which we operate. In Greenland, for 
instance, we are working to understand the 
potential impacts of our activities on the 
ways of life of the local population through 
consultation and social impact studies.
Cairn has taken a pro-active position on  
this issue for many years. Our human rights 
handbook contains guidance for managers 
on assessing human rights issues, helping 
to ensure that human rights are considered 
at key stages of every project.
Environment and climate change
Cairn is committed to protecting the 
health and sustainability of the locations  
in which we operate, as enshrined in  
our Business Principles. While we realise 
that our activities can have an impact  
on the environment, we aim, wherever 
possible, to avoid, mitigate or, at the very 
least manage, any negative impacts our 
operations may have.
One of our major achievements in 2010 
was the opening of the oil export pipeline 
in Rajasthan which, by eliminating the use 
of road tankers, will significantly reduce 
our greenhouse gas emissions from 
transporting our product to market. 46 Cairn Energy PLC Annual Report 2010
Students in Nuuk, Greenland
CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY 
(CONTINUED)
In Greenland, we undertook an EIA before 
our drilling operations started, which 
helped us develop a series of measures 
described within an Environmental 
Protection Plan (EPP) which was applied  
to the 2010 drilling programme.
In the course of its Greenland operations, 
Cairn generated a significant amount of 
environmental data, which it is sharing with 
the Greenlandic authorities. In addition, 
Cairn has contributed to environmental 
research which monitors the level of noise 
generated by drilling activities and the 
mapping of theoretical oil spill sensitivity 
scenarios along the west coast of 
Greenland. $4.5 million has been 
committed for environmental research  
in Greenland since January 2008.
Climate change is a complex issue that has 
the potential to change the way in which  
we live our daily lives. Cairn acknowledges 
these potentially adverse effects and 
understands the role we have as a 
responsible business in responding to them. 
Our climate change strategy, which is 
enshrined within our Business Principles, 
comprises four elements:
GHG measurement, verification  
and reporting;
energy and emissions efficiency;
informed and transparent action on 
climate change; and
contribution to programmes that 
address the environmental and social 
impacts of climate change.
We measure, monitor and report a 
significant number of environmental 
performance indicators in our business 
activities and these are detailed in the 
2010 CR Report. There were no oil spills  
or environmental incidents associated  
with our offshore exploration wells in 
Greenland or Tunisia. We did, however, 
experience a diesel fuel and chemical  
spill from our Sangu offshore and onshore 
facilities in Bangladesh, and two minor 
chemical spills during seismic and seabed 
surveys in Greenland. In Cairn India, there 
were nine minor oil spills associated with 
our crude trucking operations in Rajasthan, 
all of which were cleared up.
The flaring of excess gas during the start up 
and commissioning of the MPT facilities in 
Rajasthan and major maintenance activity 
carried out in Ravva contributed to a 
significant increase in greenhouse gas 
intensity from the producing fields of Cairn 
India from a re-stated 58.7 tonnes CO2 
equivalent per 1000 tonnes of production 
in 2009 to 90.7 tonnes CO2 equivalent  
per 1000 tonnes of production in 2010.  
This is still well below the average 
greenhouse gas intensity as measured  
by the OGP at 163 tonnes CO2 equivalent 
per 1000 tonnes of production in 2009.  
The greenhouse gas intensity of Cairn  
India’s fields is forecast to decline in 2011.  
For Cairn (excluding Cairn India), there was 
also a significant increase in greenhouse 
gas intensity from the Sangu field in 
Bangladesh, which reflects increased 
emissions from gas compression and lower 
levels of production as the field reaches  
the latter stages of its producing life. 
Supply chain
Cairn, like other oil and gas exploration 
companies, outsources a number of  
its activities to other contractors. As a 
consequence, the majority of operational 
hours worked are being undertaken by 
contractors’ employees. Their performance 
is therefore vital to ours overall.
Our Business Principles are important  
to many aspects of our supply chain  
and we seek to ensure that we treat our 
prospective and successful contractors  
and suppliers with honesty and integrity.  
To do so, we implement a rigorous system 
to ensure fair and transparent tendering  
of supplies and services to our activities. 
To bring additional benefits to the locations 
where we operate, we prefer to use local 
contractors and suppliers where possible. 
In many countries where we operate, there 
is no well-established sector of companies 
with experience of working for oil and  
gas activities. In these cases, we work  47

transfer where possible.
PEOPLE
Employing more than 1,300 staff in five 
different countries puts people at the 
heart of everything we do, and this is 
strongly reflected in our CR approach.
Our priorities include protecting our 
people’s health, safety and security  
and providing them with a supportive 
workplace in which diversity and equality 
are respected and valued. We engage 
with our people to understand their views, 
and provide them with opportunities to 
develop their careers at Cairn.
Integral to this approach is staff training 
and across the Group, over 50,000 hours  
of training were delivered in 2010. Other 
initiatives at our Edinburgh offices such as 
Child Care Vouchers, wellness events and 
staff rewards all help to ensure that Cairn 
continues to be considered a desirable 
place to work.
As recognition for these efforts, the 
company was proud to receive Investors  
in People reaccreditation in 2010.
COMMUNITIES AND SUPPLIERS
One of the key business goals at Cairn  
is to maintain positive relations with the 
local communities in which we operate. 
We believe our business activities can 
contribute to community and social 
development by providing energy, 
infrastructure, employment and trade  
with local enterprises.
We also aim to add value to these benefits 
through focused social investment.  
Our community development strategies 
are devised and implemented through 
consultation and partnership with local 
authorities, NGOs and other organisations.
By using tools such as SIA and social 
baseline studies, we can assess the 
potential social impacts of our activities 
and start to develop mutually beneficial 
relationships with our stakeholders.
Over the last seven years, our operations 
in India have brought many benefits  
to local people, from employment to 
improved healthcare and new income 
opportunities, such as our work to help 
dairy farmers in Rajasthan sell their milk.
In 2010, for our first drilling operations  
in Greenland, we entered into an Impact 
Benefit Agreement (IBA) with national  
and municipal authorities. This agreement 
sets out a number of commitments from 
Cairn towards social investment and 
impact mitigation related to the 2010 
drilling programme. 
The IBA in Greenland was split into four 
main areas:
Support education and skills 
development in Greenland in order  
to promote greater participation  
by Greenlanders in future oil and  
gas activities
Promoting local participation through 
raising awareness of the opportunities 
and requirements of local enterprises  
in future oil and gas activities
Investment in infrastructure and 
institutional support such as search  
and rescue and emergency response 
capabilities
Environmental research commitments  
in conjunction with the BMP and NERI 
(Danish National Environmental Institute)
In recent years, we have also been 
strengthening our relationships with 
existing suppliers and contractors, and 
encouraged them to meet the standards

VOTING RIGHTS
Subject to any special rights or restrictions 
attaching to any class of shares, at a general 
meeting or class meeting, on a show of 
hands, every member present in person 
and every duly appointed proxy entitled  
to vote shall have one vote and on a poll 
every member present in person or by 
proxy and entitled to vote shall have one 
vote for every share held by him. In the  
case of joint holders of a share, the vote  
of the senior member who tenders a vote, 
whether in person or by proxy, shall be 
accepted to the exclusion of the votes of 
the other joint holders and for this purpose, 
seniority shall be determined by the order 
in which the names stand in the register of 
members in respect of the joint holding. 
Under the Companies Act, members are 
entitled to appoint a proxy, who need not 
be a member of the Company, to exercise 
all or any of their rights to attend and to 
speak and vote on their behalf at a general 
meeting or class meeting. A member may 
appoint more than one proxy in relation  
to a general meeting or class meeting, 
provided that each proxy is appointed to 
exercise the rights attached to a different 
share or shares held by that member.  
A corporation which is a member of the 
Company may authorise one or more 
individuals to act as its representative  
or representatives at any meeting of the 
Company, or at any separate meeting of

corporation as the corporation could 
exercise if it were an individual member  
of the Company.

No member shall, unless the directors of 
the Company otherwise determine, be 
entitled in respect of any share held by him/
her to attend or vote at a general meeting 
of the Company, either in person or by 
proxy, if any call or other sum presently 
payable by him/her to the Company in 
respect of shares in the Company remains 
unpaid. Furthermore, if a member has been 
served with a notice by the Company under 
the Companies Act requesting information 
concerning interests in shares and has

the Company, within 14 days of the notice, 
with such information, the directors of  
the Company may determine that such 
member shall not be entitled in respect  
of such shares to attend or vote (either in 
person or by proxy) at any general meeting 
or at any separate general or class meeting 
of the holders of that class of shares.

Proxy forms must be submitted not less 
than 48 hours (or such shorter time as the 
Board may determine) (excluding, at the 
Board’s discretion, any part of any day  
that is not a working day) before the time 
appointed for the holding of the meeting  
or adjourned meeting or, in the case of a 
poll taken more than 48 hours after it was 
demanded, not less than 24 hours (or such 
shorter time as the Board may determine) 
before the time appointed for the taking  
of the poll at which it is to be used.
VARIATION OF RIGHTS
Whenever the share capital of the 
Company is divided into different classes  
of shares, all or any of the special rights 
attached to any class may, subject to 
statute and unless otherwise expressly 
provided by the rights attached to the 
shares of that class, be varied or abrogated 
either with the consent in writing of the 
holders of not less than three-fourths  
in nominal value of the issued shares of  
that class or with the sanction of a special 
resolution passed at a separate general 
meeting of the holders of the shares of  
that class. At every such separate general 
meeting, the quorum shall be two persons 
holding or representing by proxy at least 
one-third in nominal value of the issued 
shares of the class. These provisions also 
apply to the variation or abrogation of  
the special rights attached to some only  
of the shares of any class as if the shares 
concerned and the remaining shares of 
such class formed separate classes. The 
rights attached to any class of shares shall, 
unless otherwise expressly provided by the 
terms of issue of such shares or the terms 
upon which such shares are for the time 
being held, be deemed not to be varied  
or abrogated by the creation or issue of 
further shares ranking pari passu with, or 
subsequent to, the first mentioned shares  
or by the purchase by the Company of its 
own shares.
TRANSFER OF SHARES
Subject to any procedures set out by the 
directors in accordance with the Articles  
of Association, all transfers of shares shall 
be effected by instrument in writing in  
any usual or common form or in any other 
form acceptable to the directors of the 
Company. The instrument of transfer  
shall be executed by, or on behalf of,  
the transferor and (except in the case  
of fully paid shares) by, or on behalf of,  
the transferee. The transferor shall be 
deemed to remain the holder of the shares 
concerned until the name of the transferee 
is entered in the register of members of 
the Company. 
The directors may, in their absolute 
discretion and without assigning any reason 
therefor, refuse to register a transfer of any 
share which is not a fully paid share unless 
such share is listed on the Official List of  
the UK Listing Authority and traded on the 
London Stock Exchange’s main market for 
listed securities. The directors may also 
refuse to register a transfer of a share in 
uncertificated form where the Company  
is entitled to refuse (or is excepted from  
the requirement) under the Uncertificated 
Securities Regulations 2001 to register  
the transfer and they may refuse any  
such transfer in favour of more than four 
transferees. The directors may also refuse 
to register any transfer of a share on which 
the Company has a lien. 
The directors may, in their absolute 
discretion and without assigning any 
reason therefor, refuse to register a 
transfer of any share in certificated form 
unless the relevant instrument of transfer is 
in respect of only one class of share, is duly 
stamped or adjudged or certified as not 
chargeable to stamp duty, is lodged at the 
transfer office or at such other place as the 
directors may determine, is accompanied 
by the relevant share certificate(s) and  
such other evidence as the directors may 
reasonably require to show the right of the 
transferor to make the transfer and is in 
favour of not more than four transferees 
jointly. If the directors refuse to register a 
transfer, they shall, as soon as practicable 
and in any event within two months after 
the date on which the transfer was lodged 
with the Company (in the case of a share  
in certificated form) or the date on which 
the operator-instruction (as defined in the 
Uncertificated Securities Regulations 2001) 
was received by the Company (in the case 
of a share in uncertificated form) (or in 
either case such longer or shorter period 
(if any) as the Listing Rules may from time 
to time permit or require), send to the 
transferee notice of the refusal.

AGM 2011
The Notice of AGM is set out on pages 
144 to 147 of this document. A form of 
proxy and attendance card for use at the 
AGM are enclosed. 
The following provides an explanation of 
the proposed resolutions. Resolutions 1 to 
8 are proposed as ordinary resolutions. This 
means that for each of those resolutions  
to be passed, more than half of the votes  
cast must be in favour of the resolution. 
Resolutions 9 to 11 are proposed as special 
resolutions. This means that for each of 
those resolutions to be passed, at least 
three-quarters of the votes cast must be  
in favour of the resolution.
Resolution 1 – Annual Report  
and Accounts
The directors must lay the Company’s 
accounts, the directors’ report and the 
auditor’s report before the shareholders  
in a general meeting. 
Resolution 2 – Remuneration Report
Listed companies are required to prepare 
a directors’ remuneration report and put  
a resolution to approve the report to the 
shareholders at the AGM. A copy of the 
Directors’ Remuneration Report is set  
out on pages 68 to 83 of this document.
Resolution 3 and 4 –  
Re-appointment and  
Remuneration of Auditors
The Company is required to appoint 
auditors at each general meeting at which 
accounts are laid before shareholders,  
to hold office until the end of the next 
such meeting. Ernst & Young LLP have 
expressed their willingness to continue  
as auditors and resolution 3 proposes  
their re-appointment as the Company’s 
auditors. Resolution 4 seeks authority  
for the directors to decide the auditor’s 
remuneration. 
Resolutions 5 to 7 – Election/Re-Election 
of Directors
Alexander Berger and M. Jacqueline 
Sheppard QC were appointed as 
independent non-executive directors of  
the Company with effect from the close of 
the annual general meeting held on 20 May 
2010. Both are therefore due to retire at the 
2011 AGM (being the first annual general 
meeting of the Company following their 
appointment) and, being eligible, offer 
themselves for election as directors. Sir Bill 
Gammell will retire by rotation at the AGM 
in accordance with the Company’s Articles 
of Association and, being eligible, offers 
himself for re-election as a director. 
The directors’ biographies are set out on 
pages 48 and 49 of this document. The 
Company’s Articles of Association provide 
that directors can be appointed by the 
Company, by ordinary resolution or by the 
Board. The nomination committee makes 
recommendations to the Board on the 
appointment and replacement of directors. 
Further details of the rules governing the 
appointment and replacement of directors 
are set out in the Corporate Governance 
Statement on pages 57 to 67 and in the 
Company’s Articles of Association. An 
explanation of the performance evaluation 
procedure carried out by the Company  
is also contained in the Corporate 
Governance Statement, on page 57 .
Resolution 8 – Authority  
to Allot Shares
Resolution 8 seeks to renew the directors’ 
power to allot shares. This resolution 
proposes that authority be granted in 
substitution of the existing authority  
to allot securities up to a maximum 
amount of £2,872,414.93, representing 
approximately 33.33% of the Company’s 
total issued ordinary share capital 
(excluding treasury shares) as at 21 March 
2011, being the latest practicable date 
prior to publication of this document.
The AGM of the Company will be held in the Castle Suite of the 
Caledonian Hilton Hotel, Princes Street, Edinburgh EH1 2AB at  
12 noon (UK time) on Thursday, 19 May 2011.

Additional Information
Following guidance issued by the 
Association of British Insurers (ABI)  
in December 2008 and updated in 
November 2009, the Company is seeking 
an additional authority to allot securities in 
connection with a pre-emptive rights issue 
up to a maximum amount of £2,872,414.93, 
representing approximately 33.33% of  
the Company’s total issued ordinary share 
capital (excluding treasury shares) as at  
21 March 2011, being the latest practicable 
date prior to publication of this document. 
The benefit to the Company of obtaining 
such authority on an annual basis is that it 
would allow the Company to implement  
a rights issue of up to approximately 
66.66% of the issued ordinary share  
capital without needing to call an  
additional general meeting. This would 
shorten the implementation timetable  
of such a rights issue.
The directors consider that the authorities 
sought pursuant to Resolution 8 are 
desirable to allow the Company to retain 
flexibility, although they have no present 
intention of exercising these authorities. 
The authorities will expire on 30 June 2012 
or, if earlier, at the end of the next AGM  
of the Company to be held in 2012. 
As at 21 March 2011, being the latest 
practicable date prior to publication of this 
document, the Company did not hold any 
shares in treasury.
Resolution 9 – Disapplication  
of Pre-emption Rights
Section 561(1) of the Companies Act 2006 
provides that if the directors wish to allot 
any equity securities, or sell any treasury 
shares (if it holds any), for cash, it must first 
offer them to existing shareholders in 
proportion to their existing shareholdings. 
Section 561 does not apply to allotments 
of equity securities made in connection 
with an employee share scheme.
Resolution 9 seeks to give the directors 
power to allot equity securities or sell 
treasury shares for cash as if section 561  
of the Companies Act 2006 did not apply, 
in connection with rights issues, open 
offers and other pre-emption offers 
pursuant to the authority granted by 
Resolution 8, and otherwise up to a total 
amount of £430,905.33, representing 
approximately 5% of the Company’s total 
issued ordinary share capital as at 21 
March 2011, being the latest practicable 
date prior to publication of this document. 
The power conferred by Resolution 9 will 
expire at the same time as the authority 
conferred by Resolution 8, unless 
previously revoked, varied or extended by 
the Company in general meeting.
Resolution 10 – Market Purchase of Own 
Shares by the Company
If passed, Resolution 10 will authorise  
the Company to make market purchases  
of its own ordinary shares. Ordinary shares 
repurchased by the Company pursuant to 
such authority may be cancelled or held  
in treasury and then either sold (in whole 
or in part) for cash or cancelled (in whole  
or in part). The directors do not intend  
at present to use this power but wish to 
retain the flexibility to do so in the future. 
No dividends will be paid on treasury 
shares and no voting rights attach to them.
The maximum aggregate number of 
ordinary shares that may be purchased 
pursuant to the authority shall be 
approximately 14.99% of the issued 
ordinary share capital of the Company  
as at 21 March 2011, being 209,926,303 
ordinary shares. The maximum price which 
may be paid for an ordinary share pursuant 
to this resolution (exclusive of expenses) 
shall be the higher of (i) an amount equal 
to 105% of the average of the middle 
market quotations for the Company’s 
ordinary shares for the five business  
days immediately preceding the date of 
purchase, and (ii) the higher of the price of 
the last independent trade of an ordinary 
share and the highest current independent 
bid for an ordinary share as derived from 
the London Stock Exchange Trading 
System (SETs). The minimum price that 
may be paid for an ordinary share pursuant 
to this resolution (exclusive of expenses) 
shall be 
8
⁄13 pence, being the nominal value 
of an ordinary share.
In accordance with the Listing Rules, the 
Company will not repurchase shares in the 
period of 60 days immediately preceding 
the announcement of its interim results or 
the preliminary announcement of its annual 
results or, if shorter, the period from the 
end of the financial period concerned up  
to and including the time of a relevant 
announcement or, except in accordance 
with the Listing Rules, at any other time 
when, in terms of the Company’s dealing 
rules, the directors would be prohibited 
from dealing in shares.

DIRECTORS’ REPORT 
(CONTINUED)
This authority, if conferred, will only be 
exercised if the directors consider that any 
purchase will result in an increase in 
earnings per share of the ordinary share 
capital in issue after the purchase and, 
accordingly, would be in the best interests 
of shareholders generally.
This authority will expire on the earlier  
of 30 June 2012 or the conclusion of the 
AGM of the Company to be held in 2012, 
unless previously revoked, varied or 
renewed by the Company in general 
meeting. The directors intend to seek 
renewal of this authority at subsequent 
annual general meetings.
The Company did not purchase any of its 
own shares during 2010. As at 21 March 
2011, options to subscribe for shares  
were outstanding over an aggregate of 
4,297 ,502 ordinary shares (representing 
approximately 0.31% of the issued share 
capital of the Company as at 21 March 
2011). If the outstanding amount of the 
existing buy-back authority granted at  
the 2010 AGM was utilised in full prior  
to the 2011 AGM and the new authority 
was granted at the 2011 AGM and then 
utilised in full, the options outstanding  
at 21 March 2011 would represent 
approximately 0.44% of the issued  
share capital of the Company.
Resolution 11 – Notice  
of General Meetings 
Changes made to the Companies  
Act 2006 by the Shareholders’ Rights 
Regulations increase the notice period 
required for general meetings of the 
Company to 21 days unless shareholders 
approve a shorter notice period, which 
cannot however be less than 14 clear days. 
Annual general meetings will continue to 
be held on at least 21 clear days notice.
Before the coming into force of the 
Shareholders’ Rights Regulations on  
3 August 2009, the Company was able to  
call general meetings other than an AGM 
on 14 clear days notice without obtaining 
such shareholder approval. The directors 
believe that it is appropriate for the 
Company to retain the flexibility of being 
able to call a general meeting on 14 days’ 
notice and in order to preserve this ability, 
Resolution 11 seeks such approval. The 
flexibility offered by this resolution will be 
used where, taking into account all the 
circumstances, the directors consider this 
appropriate in relation to the business to be 
considered at the meeting. The approval 
will be effective until the Company’s next 
AGM in 2012, when it is intended that a 
similar resolution will be proposed. 
RECOMMENDATION
The Board considers that all the 
resolutions to be considered at the AGM 
are in the best interests of the Company 
and its shareholders as a whole, and 
unanimously recommends that you vote  
in favour of all of the proposed resolutions, 
as they intend to do in respect of their  
own beneficial shareholdings.

CORPORATE GOVERNANCE STATEMENT 
CAIRN’S COMMITMENT TO CORPORATE GOVERNANCE
Cairn is committed to achieving compliance with the principles and provisions set out in the 2008 Combined Code on Corporate 
Governance and to ensuring that high standards of corporate governance are maintained. In this regard, the Board is fully aware  
of the changes introduced by the new UK Corporate Governance Code published in June 2010, which supersedes the Combined 
Code and applies to listed companies with financial years beginning on or after 29 June 2010. 
Whilst the Board considers that the Company already complies with a number of the principles and provisions of the new UK 
Corporate Governance Code, it intends to thoroughly review and, where appropriate, enhance its governance processes in view  
of the new provisions by the end of 2011. The Company will, therefore, report against the new Code in the corporate governance 
statement published in the 2011 annual report.
Set out below is a statement of how the Company applied the principles of the Combined Code for the year ended 31 December 
2010. The Board considers that the Company complies with all provisions of the Combined Code, other than one which is detailed  
at the end of this statement.
THE CAIRN BOARD
Cairn’s business is international in scope and carries political, commercial and technical risks. Accordingly, particular attention is paid to 
the composition and balance of the Board to ensure that it has wide experience of the sector and regulatory environment in which Cairn 
operates, and appropriate financial and risk management skills. In each Board appointment, whether executive or non-executive, the 
Board considers that objectivity and integrity, as well as skills, experience and ability that will assist the Board in its key functions, are 
prerequisites for appointment. 
The Board currently comprises the Chairman, the Chief Executive, five executive directors and five independent non-executive 
directors. The directors’ biographies are on pages 48 and 49. Hamish Grossart and Mark Tyndall both served as non-executive 
directors during the year but retired at the AGM held on 20 May 2010. The Board appointed two new independent non-executive 
directors, Alexander Berger and M. Jacqueline Sheppard QC, with effect from the close of the AGM on 20 May 2010. 
SENIOR INDEPENDENT DIRECTOR
Iain McLaren continues to be Cairn’s senior independent non-executive director. The main responsibilities of the senior independent 
non-executive director are as follows:
To provide a sounding board for the chairman and to serve as an intermediary with other directors when necessary.
To be available to shareholders if they have concerns through which contact through the normal channels of chairman,  
chief executive or other executive directors has failed to resolve or for which such contact is inappropriate.
To meet with the other non-executive directors without the chairman present at least annually in order to appraise the  
chairman’s performance.
RE-ELECTION OF DIRECTORS
Currently, all of the directors are subject to election by shareholders at the first AGM after their appointment to the Board and to 
re-election by shareholders at least once every three years. Furthermore they are subject to re-election annually if they have held 
office with the Company, other than employment or executive office, for a continuous period of nine years or more at the date of  
the relevant AGM. These provisions have been applied in selecting the directors to be elected/re-elected at the AGM to be held  
on 19 May 2011. 
In accordance with the new UK Corporate Governance Code, all of the Company’s directors will be subject to annual re-election  
by shareholders with effect from the 2012 AGM.
PERFORMANCE EVALUATION 
The Board has in place a process for annual performance evaluation for the Board, audit, nomination and remuneration committees 
and individual directors. The Board also reviews on an annual basis whether such performance evaluation should be conducted using 
an external resource. The performance evaluation process was conducted internally and had a different agenda than in 2009. 
The process during 2010, which was led by the Chairman, focused on conducting a thorough review of the skills and experience  
of each member of the Board and of the strengths and weaknesses of the Board as a whole. 
The executive directors also have their performance individually reviewed by the remuneration committee against objectives which 
are set annually. The bonuses payable to the executive directors under the Company’s cash bonus scheme (described further in the 
Directors’ Remuneration Report on page 69) are linked directly to the results of these reviews.
The senior independent director met with the other non-executive directors (without the Chairman present) in late 2010 to evaluate 
the Chairman’s own performance and confirmed that he continued to be effective and to demonstrate a high level of commitment  
to the role.
Following the evaluation process conducted in 2010, the Board and Board committees are satisfied that they are operating 
effectively. Following the individual performance evaluations, the Board believes that all of the directors’ performance (including 
those to be elected/re-elected at the AGM) continues to be effective and that they demonstrate commitment to the role. 
A performance evaluation of the Board, the Board committees and individual directors will continue to be conducted annually and,  
in view of the provisions of the UK Corporate Governance Code, the directors also intend to review how best to implement the new 
requirement that evaluation of the board should be externally facilitated at least every three years.  58 Cairn Energy PLC Annual Report 2010
CORPORATE GOVERNANCE STATEMENT 
(continued)
INDEPENDENCE OF NON-EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
The Board evaluation and review process also covered the independence of each of the non-executive directors, taking into account 
their integrity, objectivity and contribution to the Board and its committees. The Board believes that the following behaviours are 
essential in order for a director to be considered independent:
Provides an objective, robust and consistent challenge to the assumptions, beliefs and views of senior management and the other 
directors.
Questions intelligently, debates constructively and challenges rigorously and dispassionately.
Acts at all times in the best interests of the organisation and its shareholders.
Has a detailed and extensive knowledge of the Group’s business, industry and the market as a whole and the ability to help the 
executive directors develop proposals on strategy.
Having reviewed the independence of each of the non-executive directors, the Board concluded that all of the non-executive 
directors of the Company are considered independent. 
INDUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
New directors receive a full and appropriate induction on joining the Board. This involves meetings with other Board members,  
senior management and the Company’s principal advisers. In addition, a new director is provided with an induction pack which 
contains background materials and general information on the Company, the Company’s policies and procedures, financial 
information, an operational review and a briefing on directors’ legal and regulatory responsibilities. 
The Company provides the necessary resources for developing and updating its directors’ knowledge and capabilities. In particular,  
the Company is committed to the provision of continuing professional development training to its directors and in 2010 held a number 
of seminars for Board members, which are regularly presented by the Company’s external advisers and guest speakers, on subjects 
appropriate to the Company’s business, including changes to legislation, regulation and market practice. These seminars were held at 
the end of Board meetings and were attended by all directors present at such meetings. This process is continuing in 2011. Any director 
may request that a particular subject is covered in a seminar. In addition, all media articles relating to the Company and all brokers’ and 
analysts’ reports on the Company are distributed to all directors. At least once a year, the Board visits an operational site and during 
2010, the Board visited both Greenland (in July 2010) and the Company’s operations in Rajasthan, India (in September 2010). 
INFORMATION AND SUPPORT
The Board has full and timely access to all relevant information to enable it to perform its duties. The Company Secretary and Deputy 
Company Secretary are responsible for advising the Board, through the Chairman, on all corporate governance matters. In addition, 
each director has access to the advice and services of the Company Secretary and Deputy Company Secretary. There is also a 
procedure agreed by the Board for directors, in furtherance of their duties, to take independent professional advice if necessary,  
at the Company’s expense, up to a pre-determined limit. 
DIRECTORS’ AND OFFICERS’ LIABILITY INSURANCE
The Company has directors’ and officers’ liability insurance in place. 
CONFLICTS OF INTEREST
The Board has in place a procedure for the consideration and authorisation of conflicts or possible conflicts with the Company’s 
interests. All directors are aware of the requirement to submit details to the Company Secretary of any current situations (appointments 
or otherwise) which may give rise to a conflict, or potential conflict, of interest. Notifications have been received from all of the current 
directors and there are no conflict matters requiring authorisation. The Board will continue to monitor and review potential conflicts of 
interest on a regular basis.
MATTERS RESERVED TO THE BOARD AND DELEGATION OF AUTHORITY
The Board has a formal schedule of matters specifically reserved to it for decision. These reserved matters include determination  
of the overall strategy of the Group and approval of the annual report and accounts and any other financial statements; the Group’s 
annual budget and amendments to that budget over a particular amount; borrowing and security; acquisitions and disposals; capital 
expenditure over a specified amount; amendments to the organisational structure of the Group and Board; approval of significant 
changes to accounting policies; and approval of management incentive schemes and Group policy on pensions. The schedule of 
matters reserved to the Board was also reviewed and updated during 2010.
The Board delegates the execution of its strategic objectives to the Chief Executive’s Committee, which comprises the executive 
directors and senior management. Operational management of the Group on a day-to-day basis is delegated to asset managers  
and functional heads of department. 
In addition to this, the Company during 2010 instituted two new non-board committees – the strategy review group and the technical 
advisory board – to support its operational management and strategic decision-making process. 
The strategy review group meets on an ad hoc basis and comprises five members of the senior management team (including three 
executive directors) and one non-executive director. It provides advice to the Board on strategic options open to Cairn to fulfil its 
next phase of growth. 
The technical advisory board meets at least three times per year, usually on a day immediately prior to a scheduled Board meeting,  
and currently comprises three executive directors, two independent technical experts and three non-executive directors who attend by 
invitation. It provides an independent forum for expert technical advice and peer group review of technical programmes, including new 
ventures proposals, in the context of the agreed exploration strategy. The technical advisory board also provides advice on technical 
excellence and appropriate new technology to assist in developing the Company’s growth strategy. 59 Cairn Energy PLC Annual Report 2010

BOARD MEETINGS
During 2010, seven scheduled meetings of the Board were held, six of which were held at the Company’s registered office in 
Edinburgh, with one meeting held in India. Details of attendance at each of those meetings, and at meetings of Board committees, 
are set out below. 
During the year, a number of other meetings took place to deal with specific matters that required to be considered at short notice. 
When a specific matter requires consideration at short notice, there is a procedure that sets out when those matters must be considered 
at a short-notice Board meeting and when they may be dealt with by a committee of the Board (comprising at least two non-executive 
directors, one of whom must be the chairman or the senior independent non-executive director, and two executive directors). 
Any director who is physically unable to attend Board and committee meetings is given the opportunity to be consulted and 
comment in advance of the meeting by telephone or in writing. Video and telephone conferencing facilities are also used when 
directors are not able to attend meetings in person.
The formal agenda for each scheduled Board meeting, which regularly includes presentations from senior operational management, 
is set by the Chairman in consultation with the Chief Executive and the Company Secretary. In particular, the agenda for each Board 
meeting includes a detailed update on matters in respect of the Group’s Indian business from those directors of the Company who 
also sit in a non-executive capacity on the board of Cairn India (currently Sir Bill Gammell, Jann Brown and Malcolm Thoms). The 
Chief Executive Officer of Cairn India, Rahul Dhir, also attends part of each meeting to ensure that the Board is kept fully briefed on 
matters relating to Cairn India. Formal minutes of all Board and committee meetings are circulated to all directors prior to the next 
Board meeting and are considered for approval at that Board meeting. In addition, the members of the Board are in frequent contact 
between meetings to progress the Group’s business. The non-executive directors also meet informally, without any executives 
present, on a regular basis to discuss matters in respect of the business.

BOARD COMMITTEES
The Board has established an audit committee, a remuneration committee and a nomination committee, each of which has formal 
terms of reference approved by the Board. The terms of reference for each of these committees satisfy the requirements of the 
Combined Code and are reviewed internally on an ongoing basis by the Board. Copies of the terms of reference are available  
on the Company’s website.
The committees are provided with all necessary resources to enable them to undertake their duties in an effective manner. The 
Company Secretary acts as secretary to the committees and the minutes of all committee meetings are circulated to all directors.
Set out below are reports from the audit committee, remuneration committee and nomination committee.
1. Audit Committee Report
The audit committee currently comprises three non-executive directors, all of whom are considered by the Board to be independent. 
The Board is satisfied that all members of the committee have recent and relevant financial experience. 
The members of the committee during the year were as follows:
Iain McLaren (chairman);
Dr James Buckee;
M. Jacqueline Sheppard QC (joined the committee on 20 May 2010); and
Hamish Grossart (retired as a non-executive director and member of the committee on 20 May 2010).
The audit committee met four times in 2010. At the request of the audit committee, the Finance Director and senior members of the 
Finance Department attended each of these meetings. The Chairman also attended one meeting as an observer, on being invited  
to do so by the committee. In addition, all four meetings were attended by the external auditors and by the internal auditors. 
The external auditors receive copies of all audit committee papers (including papers to be considered at meetings when they are not 
in attendance) and minutes of all committee meetings. In addition, the chairman of the committee regularly meets with the external 
audit partner to discuss matters relevant to the Company. 
The role of the committee includes:
monitoring the integrity of the financial statements of the Company and formal announcements relating to the Company’s 
financial performance and reviewing any significant financial reporting judgements contained in them; 
reviewing accounting policies, accounting treatments and disclosures in financial reports; 
reviewing the Company’s internal financial controls and internal control and risk management systems;
monitoring and reviewing the effectiveness of the Company’s internal audit function; 
overseeing the Company’s relationship with the external auditors, including making recommendations to the Board as to the 
appointment or reappointment of the external auditors, reviewing their terms of engagement, and monitoring the external 
auditors’ independence, objectivity and effectiveness; and 
reviewing the Company’s whistleblowing procedures and ensuring that arrangements are in place for the proportionate and 
independent investigation of possible improprieties in respect of financial reporting and other matters and for appropriate 
follow-up action.
Of the four audit committee meetings held during 2010, the first two meetings were in respect of the 2009 year-end process  
(the second two meetings were in respect of the 2010 interim accounts). At the first of these meetings, issues which may impact  
on the financial statements were raised by both the senior management and the external auditors. The auditors also presented  
their audit plan. Audit committee guidance was sought on accounting policies and assumptions to be adopted in preparing the 
financial statements. After discussing and challenging the issues raised, the audit committee recommended the policies to be 
adopted or directs senior management to produce further information if deemed necessary. 
At the second meeting in respect of the year-end process, the external auditors report their audit results to the audit committee, 
including a summary of any significant accounting and auditing issues, internal control findings and a summary of audit differences 
identified. The audit committee considers any disagreements in accounting treatment between management and the auditors, 
should any arise.
The audit committee has established a policy in relation to the supply of non-audit services by the external auditors and other third 
parties. The Company will engage an external adviser to provide non-audit services on the basis of the skills and experience required 
for the work, where benefit will be derived as a result of the third party’s knowledge of the Company and cost. These advisers may 
include the Company’s external auditors for a restricted list of non-audit services, although, before the engagement commences,  
the Company must be satisfied that the auditor’s objectivity and independence would not be compromised in any way as a result  
of being instructed to carry out those services. If the cumulative fees to be paid to an external adviser for the provision of non-audit 
services are below a certain level, the adviser may be engaged in accordance with the Company’s financial delegations of authority 
after a quotation has been received. If the fees payable are expected to exceed that level on a cumulative basis, the engagement 
must be approved by the audit committee in advance after following a tender process. The audit committee must also be satisfied 
that the engagement is the most effective and efficient means of procuring such non-audit services. 61 Cairn Energy PLC Annual Report 2010

1. Audit Committee Report (continued)
KPMG LLP has been appointed by the audit committee to supervise and co-ordinate the Company’s internal audit function.  
KPMG also provides internal audit services to Cairn India. At the beginning of each year, an internal audit plan is developed by the 
internal auditor, in consultation with senior management, based on a review of the outcome of the previous year’s internal audit, the 
significant risks in the Group Risk Matrix and identified mitigation measures. The internal auditor also participates in meetings of the 
Group Risk Management Committee to maintain an understanding of the business activities and associated risks and to update the 
committee on the internal audit work plan. The audit committee also receives updates on the internal audit work plan on an ongoing 
basis. The external auditors do not place any reliance on the work undertaken by the Company’s internal audit function due to the 
nature of the scope and the timing of their work. The external auditors do, however, attend all audit committee meetings where 
internal audit updates are given.
The Company monitors its auditor’s performance on an ongoing basis, including an annual assessment carried out by the audit 
committee with input from the Finance Director and other key members of the finance department. Following such assessment, the 
audit committee meets to discuss what actions, if any, require to be taken. In addition to this, the EY senior audit partner working with 
Cairn is subject to rotation. The current audit partner has worked with the Company on the 2008, 2009 and 2010 year-end process.
The Company updated its Whistleblowing Policy during 2009 and the new policy was subsequently rolled out across the organisation 
and reviewed by the audit committee. The audit committee is satisfied that arrangements are in place for the proportionate and 
independent investigation of possible improprieties in respect of financial reporting and other matters and for appropriate 
follow-up action.
2. Remuneration Committee Report
The remuneration committee currently comprises four non-executive directors, all of whom are considered by the Board to be 
independent. 
The members of the remuneration committee during the year were as follows:
Dr James Buckee (chairman);
Todd Hunt;
Norman Murray; 
Iain McLaren (joined the committee on 20 May 2010); and
Mark Tyndall (retired as a non-executive director and member of the committee on 20 May 2010).
The remuneration committee met six times during 2010. The Chief Executive, at the request of the committee, attends its meetings. 
In addition, he is consulted by the committee on its proposals. Certain other of the executive directors attended meetings of the 
committee as observers on being invited to do so by the committee. None of the members of the committee, nor the Chief 
Executive nor the Chairman, participated in any meetings or discussions relating to their own remuneration.
The role of the committee includes:
determining and agreeing with the Board the remuneration policy for all the executive directors, the Chairman and the members 
of the CEC;
within the terms of the agreed policy, determining the total individual remuneration package for each executive director;
determining the level of awards made under the Company’s long-term incentive plans and share option plans and the 
performance conditions which are to apply;
determining bonuses payable under the Company’s cash bonus scheme;
determining the vesting of awards under the Company’s long-term incentive plans and exercise of share options; and
determining the policy for pension arrangements, service agreements and termination payments for executive directors.
Details of the Company’s policies on remuneration, service contracts and compensation payments are given in the Directors’ 
Remuneration Report on pages 68 to 83.
3. Nomination Committee Report
The nomination committee currently comprises the Chairman, two independent non-executive directors and (to ensure input from 
the executive) the Chief Executive. 
The members of the nomination committee during the year were as follows:
Norman Murray (chairman);
Todd Hunt;
Iain McLaren; 
Sir Bill Gammell; and
Mark Tyndall (retired as a non-executive director and member of the committee on 20 May 2010).
The nomination committee met six times in 2010. In addition to the members listed above, certain other non-executive directors 
attended meetings on being invited to do so by the committee. 
The Combined Code requires there to be a formal, rigorous and transparent procedure for the appointment of new directors, which 
should be meritocratic and made against objective criteria. For this purpose, the Board has established the nomination committee, 
whose role includes considering the composition, balance and skills of the Board and making recommendations to the Board on 
these matters, on the appointment of new directors and on the reappointment and orderly succession of existing directors. The 
nomination committee also takes into account the benefits of diversity on the Board, including gender. Cairn currently has two 
exceptionally well qualified women on its Board, one executive and one non-executive. The Board is also diverse in terms of the 
range of experience and nationality of its members. 62 Cairn Energy PLC Annual Report 2010

New appointments during 2010
Alexander Berger and M. Jacqueline Sheppard QC were appointed as non-executive directors of the Company with effect from 
20 May 2010. The following procedures were followed in respect of these appointments:
The committee evaluated the balance of skills, knowledge and experience on the Board with a view to identifying any gaps in the skill 
set of the Board and also where gaps would exist following the retirement of Hamish Grossart and Mark Tyndall. The committee then 
decided to conduct a search for one new non-executive director with technical expertise and another new non-executive director 
with a general business, commercial and/or financial background. The committee instructed Ridgeway Partners to headhunt for these 
positions pursuant to which a list of candidates was provided to the committee. During this external selection process, additional 
potential candidates were identified by the committee. Following this, a shortlist was prepared and four candidates were interviewed 
by the Chairman and Chief Executive. 
This process identified Alexander Berger and M. Jacqueline Sheppard QC as the preferred two candidates based on their extensive 
experience in the oil and gas sector and their business, commercial and financial skills.
Alexander Berger is currently CEO of Oranje Nassau Energie B.V., a private Dutch exploration and production company based in 
Amsterdam, where his key responsibility is to grow the portfolio through the acquisition and development of production assets.  
Prior to his appointment to this role in 2009, Alexander was Managing Director of Dyas Exploration and Production BV in Utrecht 
from 2007-2009. Alexander started his industry career with Shell where he held various technical and commercial positions. 
Alexander’s educational qualifications are detailed in his biography in the board of directors section on pages 48 and 49.
M. Jacqueline (Jackie) Sheppard QC was previously Executive Vice-President, Corporate and Legal at Talisman Energy Inc, a post she 
held for 15 years (1993-2008). Jackie played a key role in Talisman’s growth from a domestic only producer of less than 50,000 boepd 
to an international producer of more than 525,000 boepd. During her career to date Jackie has been the recipient of many national 
awards as one of Canada’s top business women and corporate counsel. Jackie is director of Emera Inc. and NWest Energy Inc.,  
both public corporations, and she is Chair of the Research and Development Corporation of Newfoundland and Labrador, a Crown 
corporation. Jackie also acts as a director in other private corporations active in the oil and gas sector. Jackie’s educational and 
professional qualifications are detailed in her biography in the board of directors section on pages 48 and 49.
Following their identification as the preferred candidates and prior to their appointment, both Alexander Berger and M. Jacqueline 
Sheppard QC met with the Chairman and other members of the nomination committee and with the other non-executive directors as 
well as the executive directors, Company Secretary and senior management. They were also given the opportunity to, and subsequently 
carried out, due diligence on the Company. The nomination committee then recommended to the Board that Alexander Berger  
and M. Jacqueline Sheppard QC be appointed as non-executive directors of the Company and the proposed appointments were 
unanimously approved by the Board. Both were appointed with effect from the close of the AGM held on 20 May 2010 and were  
invited to attend the board meeting and AGM held immediately prior to their appointment. M. Jacqueline Sheppard QC was also 
appointed a member of the Company’s audit committee on 20 May 2010.
Succession planning
The nomination committee regularly reviews the structure, size and composition (including the skills, knowledge and experience) 
required of the Board and makes recommendations to the Board as appropriate. The Board has satisfied itself that the nomination 
committee has in place appropriate plans for orderly succession to the Board and senior management positions as well as procedures 
to ensure an appropriate balance of skills within the Company and on the Board and its committees. 
The Board and nomination committee are satisfied that the individuals currently fulfilling key senior management positions in the 
organisation have the requisite depth and breadth of skills, knowledge and experience to ensure that orderly succession to the  
Board and Chief Executive’s Committee can take place.
Organisational planning 
2010 was an exceptionally busy year, with drilling operations commencing in both Greenland and Tunisia and the continued transition 
of the Edinburgh office from a primarily corporate head office to a joint corporate-operational hub. Resourcing remained a key focus 
area in this respect: over the course of the year, the organisation grew its staff headcount by 22% and further engaged with a large 
number of specialist consultants to ensure that the organisation was fit-for-purpose and ably equipped to manage operations. 
With operations commencing, 2010 saw the Edinburgh office become the base for an Emergency Response Group (ERG) for 
Edinburgh-directed operations (in addition to the Crisis Response Team (CRT)), and dedicated fully-equipped response rooms were 
set up from which to manage any emergencies or crises that may arise. Employees and consultants who were part of the ERG/CRT 
teams undertook a number of emergency training exercises throughout the year to ensure they were fully trained and equipped to 
deal with a live emergency. 
Unfortunately, drilling of the Louza well offshore Tunisia was deemed commercially unsuccessful and following much consideration, 
the decision was taken to relinquish the block and to close Cairn’s office in Tunis at the end of November, which resulted in four  
local redundancies. These were managed as sensitively as possible and in strict compliance with Tunisian employment legislation. 
The decision was also taken to sell Cairn’s interest in Bangladesh to Santos and this was completed in December 2010. Fortunately, 
this was a smooth transition with all national staff continuing to be employed by Santos following the sale.  63 Cairn Energy PLC Annual Report 2010

In addition to operations, the Company continued to focus on Employee Engagement and conducted a pulse check staff survey in 
January 2010. The response rate from staff increased from the initial 2008 survey from 74% to 80%, which was in itself an indication of 
enhanced levels of engagement. We were delighted that the results across seven of the eight engagement factors showed increased 
engagement levels; however, lower levels of engagement were reported in the area of well-being. Continued efforts across all the 
engagement factors have been made over the course of the year. These have included the introduction of a new employee recognition 
scheme, formal articulation of Company Values and giving five staff the opportunity of a trip to Greenland. This was in addition to the 
continuation of our ‘free fruit Fridays’,’ lunch and learn’ programme, 6-month joiner surveys with new staff and other successful 
engagement initiatives implemented since the original survey was conducted in 2008. 
Another big achievement in 2010 was our Investors in People re-accreditation, demonstrating our ongoing commitment to our people. 
The assessment looked at our approach to business strategy, people management strategy, leadership and management strategy, 
learning and development, management effectiveness, recognition and reward, involvement and empowerment, performance 
measurement and continuous improvement. The independent assessor was “satisfied beyond any doubt” that Cairn continued  
to meet the requirements of the Investors in People Standard.
Equality and Diversity continues to be an important factor in all that we do. A comprehensive suite of Diversity policies were 
implemented in 2009 and training to all staff and contractors on Equality and Diversity in the Workplace is scheduled for 2011.  
We continue to monitor the diversity of our workforce and are pleased that, as the organisation has grown, so too has the diverse 
nature of our staff. Over the past year, while our headcount within the Capricorn organisation comprises marginally more women  
than men (48%:52%), the number of women in managerial roles has increased from 15.15% to 26.83%. Our workforce also comprises 
a more diverse range of ethnicities (5% compared with 2% in 2009) and employees with a disability (4% compared with 3% in 2009).
2011 looks set to be another busy year on the resourcing front as the organisation continues to grow. Work on our Employer Brand  
is currently under way to assist us in continuing to attract the very best talent and help us to meet the organisation’s resource needs 
both this year and in the future. A comprehensive engagement plan is once again in place for 2011 to enhance our ability to attract 
talent and to help maintain our strong staff retention record. In response to the results from the 2010 survey, this will include a key 
focus on employee well-being with a planned introduction of a gym/fitness allowance and other wellness-related activities.
RELATIONS WITH SHAREHOLDERS
Communications with shareholders are given high priority by the Board. Cairn sends both its annual report and accounts and 
half-yearly report to all shareholders. In order to ensure that the members of the Board develop an understanding of the views  
of major shareholders, there is regular dialogue with institutional shareholders, including meetings after the announcement of  
the year-end and interim results. The Chairman usually attends a number of these meetings. At the Board meeting immediately 
following these meetings, a detailed report is given to all directors who were not in attendance at those meetings. In addition, the 
Company maintains an external relations database which details all meetings attended by the directors with third party stakeholders. 
All analysts’ and brokers’ reports on the Company are also distributed to all directors. Cairn responds to all correspondence from 
shareholders and its website contains a wide range of information on the Company, including a dedicated investor relations section. 
A list of the Company’s major shareholders can be found in the Directors’ Report on page 53.
The senior independent non-executive director is available to shareholders if they have concerns which contact through the normal 
channels of the Chairman, Chief Executive or Finance Director has failed to resolve or for which such contact is inappropriate.
Each of the non-executive directors is available to attend meetings with major shareholders (without the executive directors present), 
if requested by such major shareholders.
ANNUAL GENERAL MEETING 
The Board uses the AGM to communicate with private and institutional investors and welcomes their participation. It is policy  
for all directors to attend the AGM if at all possible. Whilst this may not always be possible for business or personal reasons, in 
normal circumstances the chairmen of the audit, remuneration and nomination committees will attend the AGM and be available 
to answer questions.
It is policy to involve shareholders fully in the affairs of the Company and to give them the opportunity at the AGM to ask questions 
about the Company’s activities and prospects. 
Details of resolutions to be proposed at the AGM on 19 May 2011 can be found in the Notice of Annual General Meeting on 
pages 144 and 145 and on the Company’s website. Further explanation of the resolutions can also be found in the Directors’ 
Report on pages 54 to 56.
The proxy votes for and against each resolution, as well as abstentions, will be counted before the AGM and the results will be made 
available at the meeting after the shareholders have voted on each resolution on a poll. The Form of Proxy for the AGM includes a 
‘vote withheld’ option in respect of each resolution, to enable shareholders to abstain on any particular resolution. It is explained on 
the Form of Proxy that a ‘vote withheld’ is not a vote in law and will not be counted in the calculation of the proportion of the votes 
‘for’ or ‘against’ a resolution. 64 Cairn Energy PLC Annual Report 2010
CORPORATE GOVERNANCE STATEMENT 
(continued)
DIRECTORS’ RESPONSIBILITY STATEMENT 
The directors are responsible for preparing the annual report and the Group and Company financial statements in accordance  
with applicable United Kingdom law and those International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the European Union. 
Under Company Law the directors must not approve the Group and Company financial statements unless they are satisfied that they 
present fairly the financial position, financial performance and cash flows of the Group and Company for that period. In preparing 
those financial statements, the directors are required to:
select suitable accounting policies in accordance with IAS 8 ‘Accounting Policies, Changes in Accounting Estimates and Errors’  
and then apply them consistently;
present information, including accounting policies, in a manner that provides relevant, reliable, comparable and understandable 
information;
provide additional disclosures when compliance with the specific requirements in IFRSs is insufficient to enable users to 
understand the impact of particular transactions, other events and conditions on the Group’s financial position and financial 
performance;
state that the Group and Company has complied with IFRSs, subject to any material departures disclosed and explained in  
the financial statements; and
make judgements and estimates that are reasonable and prudent.
The directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting records that are sufficient to show and explain the Group’s and 
Company’s transactions and disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position of the Group and Company and 
enable them to ensure that the Group and Company’s financial statements comply with the Companies Act 2006 and Article 4 of the 
IAS Regulation. They are also responsible for safeguarding the assets of the Group and Company and hence for taking reasonable 
steps for the prevention and detection of fraud and other irregularities. 
DIRECTORS’ STATEMENT PURSUANT TO THE DISCLOSURE AND TRANSPARENCY RULES
Each of the directors, whose names are listed in the Board of Directors section on pages 48 and 49 confirms to the best of his 
knowledge that:
the financial statements give a true and fair view of the assets, liabilities, financial position and profit or loss of the Group and 
Company; and
the Directors’ Report includes a fair review of the development and performance of the business and the position of the Group 
and Company, together with a description of the principal risks and uncertainties that it faces.
INFORMATION PURSUANT TO THE TAKEOVERS DIRECTIVE
The Company has provided the additional information required by DTR 7 .2.7 (directors’ interests in shares; appointment and 
replacement of directors; powers of the directors; restrictions on voting rights and rights regarding control of the Company)  
in the Directors’ Report.
GOING CONCERN
The directors have considered the factors relevant to support a statement on going concern. They have a reasonable expectation 
that the Group has adequate financial resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future and have therefore 
continued to use the going concern basis in preparing the financial statements.
INTERNAL CONTROL
The Board acknowledges its responsibility for the system of internal control and for reviewing its effectiveness. The Company has in 
place an Integrated Internal Control & Assurance Framework (the framework), which plays a critical role in managing the risks towards 
the achievement of corporate vision, strategy and objectives, and is also central to safeguarding shareholders’ interests and Company 
assets. This system of internal control is in accordance with the guidance of the Turnbull Committee and is designed to manage rather 
than eliminate the risk of failure to achieve business objectives and can only provide reasonable but not absolute assurance against 
material misstatement or loss. 
The process has been in place in respect of the Group for the 2010 accounting period and up to the date of approval of the report 
and accounts. The Board has carried out a review of the effectiveness of the system of internal controls during 2010 and will ensure 
that such reviews are performed in 2011. In so doing, the Board has taken into account the assurance provided by the Chief Executive 
Officer of Cairn India and Chief Executive of Cairn Energy PLC in respect of the effectiveness of the system of internal control within 
Cairn India Limited and Cairn Energy PLC. The Board is accordingly satisfied that effective controls are in place and that risks have 
been mitigated to an acceptable level. 
The Company is subject to a variety of risks which derive from the nature of the oil and gas exploration and production business and 
relate to the countries in which it conducts its activities. The directors believe that Cairn derives its competitive edge by focusing 
activities in areas where they believe they have a technical and commercial advantage and the experience gained over many years 
enables the Company to manage these risks effectively. 
Operations in any country are only possible when values are shared, and the directors believe that the Group’s values of integrity, 
social and environmental responsibility, teamwork and nurturing of individuals, creativity, risk management and alliances with key 
partners are ingredients that are central to the Company’s success. The ability to recognise the value of working as a partnership  
with host governments, both nationally and regionally, has also been a critical ingredient in this approach and success. 65 Cairn Energy PLC Annual Report 2010

INTERNAL CONTROL (continued)
2010 was another year of change. The Company focused on conducting an exploration drilling programme in its Capricorn subsidiary  
in Greenland and Tunisia and supporting its subsidiary company Cairn India in progressing the Mangala Field development. Particular 
attention has been placed by Group management on ensuring that a robust system of internal control has been maintained during 2010 
in relation to the significant risks in these business activities. This included the Greenland drilling programme, where a thorough and 
robust strategy was in place, even before the tragic incident in the Gulf of Mexico.
Cairn India is subject to the rules, regulations and guidelines of SEBI and to its listing agreement with the BSE and NSE. Under  
the terms of a relationship agreement between the Company and Cairn India entered into at the time of the IPO (the ‘Relationship 
Agreement’), both companies have also agreed to use reasonable endeavours to ensure that they can comply with their respective 
obligations to SEBI, the FSA, the BSE, the LSE and the NSE and under the SEBI Insider Trading Regulations and UK regulation  
and legislation relating to the disclosure of information or dealing in respect of listed securities or corporate governance. This has 
included adopting and following the principles and policies of corporate governance, including risk management, which enable  
each company to comply with these obligations. 
The following describes the key elements of the framework and the processes used by the Board during 2010 to review the 
effectiveness of the system. It also describes the approach to be taken in 2011.
1. Strategic direction
The Group business model is conventional in that strategy is set by the directors and approved by the Board and its implementation 
is delegated to the CEC. Following its listing on the BSE and NSE in January 2007 , Cairn India is a subsidiary of the Company with  
its own board of directors. In accordance with the memorandum and articles of association of Cairn India, the Company has three 
non-executive directors on the board of Cairn India (including Sir Bill Gammell as Chairman) and, therefore, has an input to Cairn 
India’s strategy.
2. Operating management
Outside of Cairn India, the Group, through its unlisted wholly–owned subsidiary Capricorn, operates several business units in different 
countries and with various partners. Capricorn has an asset-led matrix organisation where the assets are the principal focus tasked with 
delivering objectives for their particular asset. Functional Departments provide support to the assets in delivering their objectives.
Work programmes and budgets are prepared annually to meet the Group strategy, starting at asset level before being consolidated at 
Group level. A detailed business plan is also prepared to meet the agreed annual work programme and budget. This sets out detailed 
objectives and KPIs for each asset and supporting functional departments, and is consolidated into the Company’s annual business 
plan. After an iterative process, the business plan and budget is presented to the CEC and the Board for approval. 
The asset management teams then have the required authority to implement these business plans and to deliver the agreed work 
programme within the approved budget and delegations of authority, and in accordance with the internal control framework. 
The remit of the CEC is to oversee the delivery of the strategy through the annual business plans and approved budget. The directors 
have also appointed Group Functional Department Heads whose roles include providing input and ‘challenge’ to the work programmes, 
budgets and business plans, and supplying the relevant director with full and accurate information and to make statements on the 
adequacy of internal control.
3. Risk management 
The Group Risk Management Committee (GRMC), established by the Board in 1999, continues to be responsible for the development  
of risk management strategy and processes within the Company and for overseeing the implementation of the requirements of this 
strategy. It does this by ensuring that the framework for the identification, assessment, mitigation and reporting on all areas of risk is  
‘fit for purpose’ and that appropriate assurance arrangements are in place in relation to these risks. 
The Group Business Risk Management System (GBRMS) defines the processes through which Cairn seeks to systematically identify, 
analyse, assess, treat and monitor the business risks faced by the Group. The GBRMS also identify the risk management organisational 
structure through which business risks are managed and regularly reviewed at operating, asset, country and group levels. 
In 2010, the GRMC was chaired by the Finance Director and in keeping with its rotation policy, the Legal and Commercial Director 
took over the chair in January 2011. The GRMC comprises executive directors and senior functional management. The non-executive 
chairman of the audit committee is a member of the GRMC and the Internal Auditor also attends meetings, in order to ensure internal 
audit’s integration with the risk management process. A Corporate and Functional Risk Management Sub Committee is also in place 
under the chairmanship of the Director, Planning & Business Development, to manage the assessment and treatment of wider 
business risks that may affect the Company’s ability to deliver its strategy.
Subsequent to its listing, Cairn India operates its own RMC in line with its Business Risk Management System (BRMS) under the 
chairmanship of its Chief Operating Officer and reporting to the Cairn India Board. Risk Management Sub Committees have also been 
set up reporting to the Cairn India RMC to consider the specific risks associated with operations, finance, exploration, commercial, and 
the Rajasthan upstream and midstream projects. The Cairn India BRMS is substantially similar to that of the Company and, under the 
terms of the Relationship Agreement, a copy of the Cairn India risk report and RMC minutes is routinely submitted for review at the 
GRMC, at which a senior representative from Cairn India is present to provide explanation and take questions.  66 Cairn Energy PLC Annual Report 2010
CORPORATE GOVERNANCE STATEMENT 
(continued)
INTERNAL CONTROL (continued) 
3. Risk management (continued)
Business risks, together with the identified mitigating measures and responsibilities, are recorded in asset and country risk registers 
which are reported through to the Group risk register. The Cairn India, asset and corporate and functional risk registers are integrated 
into the Group risk register, and are regularly reviewed by the GRMC to ensure that the business understands the key risks it faces and 
that there is an embedded risk management approach in place across the Group.
The GRMC reports on the Group’s risk profile to both the audit committee and the Board. Additionally, the audit committee and 
Board receive internal reviews of the effectiveness of internal control relative to the key risks. The conclusion of the Board following 
these reviews during 2010 is that the internal controls in respect of key risks are effective.
4. Financial Accounts
To mitigate risks in the preparation of the Group consolidated accounts, Cairn uses a standard accounting policy manual throughout  
the Group to ensure that transactions are recognised and balances measured and reported in accordance with prescribed accounting 
policies. Information is appropriately reviewed and reconciled as part of the Group reporting process and this is supplemented by 
frequent planning and review visits from those responsible for the preparation of the consolidated accounts to the Group’s key overseas 
locations. A uniform chart of accounts within the Capricorn Group and direct one-to-one mapping of the Cairn India Group trial 
balances supplemented by standard reporting packs used for submissions from overseas locations ensures that information is gathered 
and presented in a consistent manner.
5. Assurance
The framework adopted by the Board provides for three levels of assurance against the risks facing the Group: firstly at operational 
level; secondly, through overview by Group functional management and the GRMC; and thirdly through internal, external or joint 
venture audits.
The integrated internal control and assurance framework was updated and distributed throughout the Company in October  
2010. The new version reflects changes to the organisation since the original version was issued in May 2005, including the  
move to an asset-led organisation and the feedback from the Deloitte’s review in 2009 into the appropriateness of the Cairn 
framework. It includes a description of the Cairn business and assurance models, organisation and Committee structure and  
defines responsibilities. The framework also defines the key policies/procedures which govern the way in which Cairn conducts  
its business and are therefore a core part of its system of internal control. 
A separate Group HSE, Risk and Compliance Department was established in January 2010 reporting to the Finance Director with the 
role of providing independent verification of the CR, business risk and compliance activities. In 2010, the Company also established 
two advisory committees (described earlier in this statement on page 58) which facilitate independent advice on strategic and 
technical issues.
During 2010, the directors reviewed the effectiveness of the Group’s system of financial and non-financial controls, including operational 
and compliance controls, risk management and the Group’s high level internal control arrangements. The directors derive assurance 
from the following internal and external controls:
a regularly updated schedule of matters specifically reserved for a decision by the Board;
implementation of policies and procedures for key business activities;
an appropriate organisational structure;
control over non-operated joint venture activities through delegated representatives;
specific delegations of authority for all financial and other transactions;
segregation of duties where appropriate and cost effective;
business and financial reporting, including KPIs;
functional management reviews;
nomination of various directors of the Company to the Cairn India Board (in a non-executive capacity) and to certain of its 
committees. The Board also receives copies of minutes of meetings of the Cairn India Board of directors;
a Relationship Agreement with Cairn India, which, inter alia, contains provisions for the supply by Cairn India to the Company  
of such information and confirmations as the Company may require to comply with legal, regulatory and reporting obligations;
an annual ‘letters of assurance’ process, through which asset and functional managers confirm the adequacy of internal financial 
and non-financial controls and their compliance with Group policies and report any control weaknesses identified in the past year;
a ‘letter of assurance’ from the Cairn India Chief Executive Officer and Cairn Energy PLC Chief Executive confirming the adequacy 
of internal controls within Cairn India and Cairn Energy PLC in line with its policy, and reporting any control weaknesses identified 
in the past year;
Group internal audits to assess compliance – the internal auditor implements a number of audits during the year in line with the 
annual internal audit plan approved by the audit committee and Board;
reports from the Group audit committee and GRMC, (including reports from the Cairn India RMC and Cairn India audit committee);
reports from the new advisory committees on technical and strategic options;
reports from the Group external auditor on matters identified during its statutory audit;
reports from audits by host governments and co-venturers; and
independent third party reviews. 67 Cairn Energy PLC Annual Report 2010

DIRECTORS’ REMUNERATION REPORT 
INTRODUCTION
This report has been prepared in accordance with Regulation 11 and Schedule 8 of the Large and Medium-Sized Companies  
and Groups (Accounts and Reports) Regulations 2008 (the ‘Regulations’). The report also meets the relevant requirements of  
the Listing Rules of the Financial Services Authority and describes how the Board has applied the Principles of Good Governance 
relating to directors’ remuneration. As required by the Regulations, a resolution to approve the report will be proposed at the 
forthcoming AGM.
In preparing this report, the Company has also taken into account the Principles and Guidelines on Remuneration issued by the 
Association of British Insurers and the voting guidelines issued by the National Association of Pension Funds, as well as individual 
voting guidelines published by the Company’s institutional investors.
The Company’s auditors are required to report to Cairn’s shareholders on the ‘auditable parts’ of this report and to state whether,  
in their opinion, those parts have been properly prepared in accordance with the Regulations and the Companies Act 2006. In light 
of this requirement, and in order to present the information in a form that is as accessible as possible to shareholders, the report has 
been split into two main sections – the first containing information which is unaudited and the second containing information which  
is audited.
1. UNAUDITED INFORMATION
Overview of the Remuneration Committee and its policies
Purpose and role of the Remuneration Committee
The remuneration committee determines and agrees with the Board the overall remuneration policy for the executive directors and 
the members of the Company’s senior management. Within the terms of the agreed policy, the committee is also responsible for:
determining the total individual remuneration package for each executive director;
determining the level of awards made under the Company’s long-term incentive plans and share option plans and the 
performance conditions which are to apply;
determining bonuses payable under the Company’s annual cash bonus scheme;
determining the vesting of awards under the Company’s long-term incentive plans and exercise of share options; and
determining the policy for pension arrangements, service agreements and termination payments for executive directors.
In designing the remuneration structures of the executive directors, the committee takes into account pay policies within the Group 
as a whole. In this regard, the committee reviews and approves the overall remuneration levels of employees beneath senior 
management level (it does not review individual remuneration amounts for such employees).
Cairn’s remuneration committee operates within written terms of reference agreed by the Board. These are reviewed periodically to 
ensure that the remuneration committee remains up to date with best practices appropriate to Cairn, its strategy and the business 
environment in which it operates. The terms of reference of the remuneration committee are available on the Company’s website.
Members of the Remuneration Committee
The members of the remuneration committee during the year were as follows:
Dr James Buckee (chairman);
Todd Hunt;
Norman Murray;
Iain McLaren (joined the committee on 20 May 2010); and
Mark Tyndall (retired as a non-executive director and member of the committee on 20 May 2010).
All of the current members of the committee are independent non-executive directors. The Chief Executive is not a member of the 
remuneration committee but may attend its meetings by invitation and is consulted in respect of certain of its proposals (although 
the Chief Executive is not consulted or involved in any discussions in respect of his own remuneration).
Advisers to the Remuneration Committee
As and when the remuneration committee deems appropriate, it takes external advice on remuneration from a number of sources.  
The committee periodically consults with Hewitt New Bridge Street (an independent executive compensation consultancy appointed  
by the committee) on various aspects of the directors’ remuneration packages. In addition, the Company’s legal advisers (Shepherd and 
Wedderburn LLP) and auditors (Ernst & Young LLP) provide ongoing assistance to the committee in respect of the Company’s long-term 
incentive plans and share option schemes. Advice obtained from Ernst & Young LLP is purely in relation to their independent verification 
of the Company’s achievement against performance conditions applicable to the Company’s long-term incentive plans and share  
option schemes.
Remuneration policy – overview
Cairn’s policy on executive directors’ remuneration for the current year and subsequent financial years is that the overall remuneration 
package should be sufficiently competitive to attract, retain and motivate high-quality individuals capable of achieving the Group’s 
objectives and thereby enhancing shareholder value.
The package is designed to support the Group’s business strategy and to provide an appropriate incentive to maximise individual 
and corporate performance, whilst ensuring that overall rewards are market competitive. The overall package is generally weighted 
more towards variable pay and, in relation to the variable pay element, the package is weighted more towards long-term 
performance through the award of long-term incentives.
There have been no changes to the Company’s remuneration policy and practices during 2010 other than the implementation  
of an all-employee share incentive plan, which is described on page 79. 69 Cairn Energy PLC Annual Report 2010

Explanation of the components of executive directors’ remuneration
Each executive director’s remuneration package currently consists of basic salary, benefits, annual performance related bonuses,  
a long-term incentive plan, a defined contribution pension (if appropriate) and life assurance of four times basic annual salary. 
Executive directors are also eligible to participate in the Company’s all-employee share incentive plan.

Pension provision T o provide a competitive defined contribution to the individual’ s pension arrangements
All employee Share Incentive Plan  T o reward all employees for Company performance and encourage employee share 
ownership aligned to the interests of shareholders
Other benefits T o provide a competitive, cost-effective benefits package 
Basic salary and benefits
Basic salary is reviewed annually by the remuneration committee and any changes take effect from 1 January each year. In deciding 
appropriate levels, the committee periodically utilises objective benchmarking, which gives up-to-date information on remuneration 
practice within a comparator group of similar companies within the sector.
Following the most recent detailed benchmarking review carried out by Hewitt New Bridge Street consultants in early 2010, the basic 
salaries of the executive directors for the year 2010 were £600,000 for Sir Bill Gammell, £420,000 for Dr Mike Watts and £360,000 for 
each of Malcolm Thoms, Phil Tracy, Jann Brown and Simon Thomson.
The executive directors’ salaries for the year 2011 have been increased by approximately 4% to £625,000 for Sir Bill Gammell, £435,000 
for Dr Mike Watts and £375,000 for each of Malcolm Thoms, Phil Tracy, Jann Brown and Simon Thomson. This is in line with the increase 
awarded to all other employees.
Benefits available to the executive directors comprise a company car, permanent health insurance, private health insurance and death 
in service benefit. Further details of the salary and benefits of each of the executive directors are also set out in the remuneration 
table on page 76.
Annual cash bonus scheme
Cairn’s annual cash bonus scheme applies to all employees and executive directors.
For all participants, bonuses under the scheme are based on individual and Company performance measures. Individual performance  
is measured through the Company’s performance management system. Company performance measures are based on annually 
defined key performance indicators (‘KPIs’). The KPIs for 2010 encompassed various portfolio growth and operational performance 
targets, the majority of which were met. Cairn is not wholly driven by financial KPIs – our focus is on the safe execution of proposed  
work programmes, maximising the value of our portfolio and maintaining financial and commercial discipline.
In addition to the above, the bonus award to the executive directors is currently subject to two further performance measures, being 
performance against annually defined corporate objectives for the CEC and also Cairn India KPIs (the latter replaced the reserve 
replacement performance measure used in relation to the 2009 cash bonus award). The Cairn India KPI’s comprised various operational 
targets in relation to HSE, operational excellence, project execution excellence, crude oil sales, stakeholder management, exploration, 
systems enhancements, technical skills, business planning and business improvement initiatives. The CEC’s corporate objectives for 
2010 are commercially sensitive and are therefore excluded from this report, as are the 2011 corporate objectives.
For 2010, this resulted in one quarter of each executive director’s award being determined by individual performance, one quarter by 
Company performance against the annually defined KPIs referred to above, one quarter by performance against the CEC’s corporate 
objectives, and one quarter by performance against Cairn India KPIs. The choice of these measures, and their respective weightings, 
reflects the remuneration committee’s belief that any short-term incentive compensation should be tied both to the overall 
performance of the Company and to those areas of its business that each individual can directly influence.
The maximum level of bonus award for the executive directors and other senior executives for 2010 was up to 100% of salary. None of 
the executive directors received the maximum amount payable. The actual bonuses awarded to the executive directors for performance 
in 2010 are shown in the remuneration table on page 76. The bonus cap for all other employees for 2010 was between 25% and 40%.
The remuneration committee has the discretion to award bonuses in addition to those payable under the annual cash bonus scheme 
in recognition of particular efforts or achievements by employees, including executive directors. No bonuses of this kind were 
awarded to executive directors during 2010.
A similar structure with equivalent maximum bonus potentials will operate in 2011. 70 Cairn Energy PLC Annual Report 2010

Long-term incentives – introduction
In order to encourage executive directors (and other selected senior employees) to deliver superior levels of long-term performance 
for the benefit of shareholders, the Company’s policy since 1999 has been to provide these individuals with share incentives under a 
long-term incentive plan. The current arrangement is the Cairn Energy PLC Long Term Incentive Plan (2009) (‘2009 LTIP’), which was 
approved by shareholders at the AGM held on 19 May 2009.
During the year, executive directors also held outstanding awards under the following historic share incentive arrangements operated 
by the Company:
The Cairn Energy PLC Long Term Incentive Plan 2006 (‘2006 LTIP’).
The Cairn Energy PLC Replacement Long Term Incentive Plan (‘Replacement LTIP’).
Summaries of the 2009 LTIP , 2006 LTIP and Replacement LTIP are provided below.
2009 LTIP
The 2009 LTIP enables executive directors and selected senior employees (excluding those employed by the Cairn India Group) to be 
granted conditional awards over ordinary shares, the vesting of which is normally dependent on both continued employment with the 
Group and the extent to which pre-determined performance conditions are met over a specified period of three years. The scheme is 
intended to incentivise the participants to create shareholder value whilst retaining due focus on the underlying financial performance  
of the Group and to align their interests more closely with those of shareholders.
The value of ordinary shares awarded to a participant under the 2009 LTIP in any financial year is subject to a limit of 300% of his/her basic 
salary (although a 400% of salary limit can be applied to an individual by the remuneration committee in exceptional circumstances).
On the vesting of an award under the 2009 LTIP , only 50% of the ordinary shares to which the holder has become entitled are released 
to him/her immediately, with the remaining 50% normally being released after a further period of one year. No amounts due under the 
2009 LTIP are recognised as remuneration until the award has vested and the ordinary shares released.
The first awards under the 2009 LTIP were made on 29 May 2009 to the executive directors and a selection of the Company’s senior 
managers. A further award was made to the executive directors on 26 March 2010. Details of the awards granted to the executive 
directors are set out on page 77 .
Pages 79 and 80 contain a summary of the performance conditions that will determine the extent to which the above awards vest at 
the end of the applicable performance period. For awards made in future years, the remuneration committee will review, and may 
amend, the performance conditions used for this arrangement in order to ensure they remain appropriate, challenging and in line 
with best practice/investor guidelines.
2006 LTIP
The 2006 LTIP was approved by shareholders at the EGM held on 17 November 2006, conditional on the flotation of Cairn India 
becoming effective, which occurred on 9 January 2007 . Following the adoption of the 2009 LTIP , no further awards have been or  
will be granted under the 2006 LTIP . The date of grant of the last award under the 2006 LTIP was 7 July 2008.
The 2006 LTIP enabled executive directors and selected senior employees to be granted conditional awards over two separate pools  
of notional ‘units’, the first relating to Cairn India (‘Cairn India Units’) and the second relating to the Capricorn Group (‘Capricorn Units’) 
(together, ‘Units’).
As explained in last year’s directors’ remuneration report, significant issues were identified by the remuneration committee in  
relation to one aspect of the 2006 LTIP’s operation, namely the mechanism for valuing Capricorn Units. As a result, all participants  
in this arrangement who held awards over Capricorn Units (‘Capricorn Awards’) were, during 2009, invited to surrender those rights  
in exchange for the grant of ‘Converted Awards’ over ordinary shares in the Company pursuant to the Replacement LTIP (further 
details of which are provided below), with the number of ordinary shares subject to each such Converted Award being calculated  
by reference to an implied valuation of the Capricorn Group derived from the 2009 ‘farm-in’ to its Greenland assets by PETRONAS. 
On the basis that each of these individuals accepted this invitation, there are no outstanding Capricorn Awards under the 2006 LTIP .
The above conversion process did not, however, apply to outstanding awards over Cairn India Units (‘Cairn India Awards’). As a result, 
these awards (which are held by the executive directors and a number of senior managers) continued to subsist on their 
original terms.
The extent to which a Cairn India Award vests is dependent on continued employment within the Group and the extent to which 
pre-determined performance conditions relating to Cairn India are met over a specified period.
Following the vesting of a Cairn India Award, the participant becomes entitled to such number of ordinary shares in the Company  
as have a market value equal to the aggregate price of the vested Units. (For the purposes of the 2006 LTIP , the price of a Cairn India 
Unit on any day is equal to the price of a Cairn India share, as quoted on the BSE and the NSE of India.) Only 50% of these ordinary 
shares are transferred to the participant immediately. The remaining 50% are normally withheld for a further year.
Information in relation to the Cairn India Awards held by the executive directors, together with details of those awards that vested 
during 2010, are set out on pages 77 and 78. A summary of the applicable performance conditions is provided on pages 80 and 81. 71 Cairn Energy PLC Annual Report 2010

Replacement LTIP
The Replacement LTIP was approved by shareholders at the EGM on 21 December 2009 and, as explained above, has been used  
to grant Converted Awards over ordinary shares to those participants in the 2006 LTIP who accepted the invitation to surrender  
their Capricorn Awards. These Converted Awards were granted on 22 December 2009.
Converted Awards comprise conditional rights to acquire ordinary shares, the vesting of which is normally dependent both on 
continued employment with the Group and on the extent to which pre-determined performance conditions are met over a specified 
period of three years. The form of these performance conditions, and the period over which they are measured, mirrors those that 
applied to the replaced Capricorn Awards.
On the vesting of a Converted Award, any ordinary shares to which the holder becomes entitled are normally subject to an extended 
‘holding period’ during which they cannot be sold (save to meet tax liabilities arising on vesting). This period will generally last until  
9 January 2013. Where a participant ceases employment with the Group during this holding period his/her unreleased ordinary 
shares will normally be forfeit for no consideration.
Exceptions to this general forfeiture principle are at the remuneration committee’s discretion but will usually be limited to ‘good 
leaver’ circumstances. In addition, if prior to the end of the holding period, events occur which cause the remuneration committee to 
consider that the implied value of the Capricorn Group used as part of the conversion process (see above) was materially overstated 
as at the date on which the conversion took place, then a proportion of a participant’s unreleased ordinary shares may be forfeited 
for no consideration. In these circumstances, the number of ordinary shares to be forfeited will be decided by the remuneration 
committee on such fair and equitable basis as it may determine at the relevant time.
Information in relation to the Converted Awards held by executive directors, together with details of those awards that vested during 
2010, are set out on pages 77 to 79. A summary of the applicable performance conditions is provided on pages 81 and 82.
No awards were granted under the Replacement LTIP during 2010 and no further awards will be granted pursuant to this 
arrangement in the future.
Pension arrangements
The Company operates a defined contribution group personal pension plan in the UK. The scheme is non-contributory and all UK 
permanent employees are eligible to participate. The Company contributes 10% of basic annual salary (15% in respect of senior 
executives) on behalf of all qualifying employees. The Company also has a pension committee which meets on a regular basis to 
assess the performance and suitability of the Company’s pension arrangements.
Dr Mike Watts and Jann Brown are members of the Company plan and, during the year, both received a contribution equal to 15%  
of their respective annual basic salaries.
Simon Thomson and Malcolm Thoms both have an individual personal pension plan and, during the year, received a contribution 
from the Company equal to 15% of their respective annual basic salaries.
During the year, Sir Bill Gammell and Phil Tracy both received an amount equivalent to 15% of their respective annual basic salaries  
in the form of additional salary, as their pension arrangements are fully funded.
Further details of the contributions made by the Company in respect of each executive director are set out in the remuneration table 
on page 76.
The Company is also the principal employer for a Small Self-Administered Scheme. Sir Bill Gammell is the sole member of this scheme. 
The Company is not contractually obliged to make any contributions into this scheme on behalf of Sir Bill Gammell and did not do so 
during the year.
All employee share schemes
Share Incentive Plan 2010
In order to encourage increased levels of long-term share ownership amongst its general employee population, the Company 
launched an HM Revenue & Customs approved share incentive plan (‘SIP’) in April 2010. The SIP provides eligible employees, 
including the executive directors, with the following benefits:
‘Partnership shares’ – employees can authorise deductions of up to £1,500 per tax year from pre-tax salary, which are then used  
to acquire ordinary shares on their behalf.
‘Matching shares’ – the Company can award further free shares to all participants who acquire partnership shares on the basis  
of up to two matching shares for every one partnership share purchased. For the tax year 2010/2011, the Company awarded two 
matching shares for every one partnership share purchased and intends to continue using this award ratio for the tax year 2011/2012.
‘Free shares’ – employees can be given up to £3,000 worth of ordinary shares free in each tax year. The first award of free shares 
to employees, including the executive directors, was made on 24 May 2010.
As the SIP is an ‘all-employee’ arrangement, no performance conditions are imposed in relation to any matching or free shares 
awarded pursuant to its terms. 72 Cairn Energy PLC Annual Report 2010

Share option schemes for other employees
Introduction
The Company currently operates the following share option schemes for employees below senior management level.
2009 Approved Share Option Plan (‘2009 Approved Option Plan’)
2009 Unapproved Share Option Plan (‘2009 Unapproved Option Plan’)
Replacement Share Option Plan (‘Replacement Option Plan’)
2003 Approved Share Option Plan (‘2003 Option Plan’)
2002 Unapproved Share Option Plan (‘2002 Option Plan’)
1996 Second Share Option Scheme (‘1996 Option Scheme’)
Brief summaries of these arrangements are set out below. It should, however, be noted that none of the Company’s executive 
directors participate in any of the above schemes and it is not intended that options will be granted to them under these 
arrangements in the future.
2009 Approved Option Plan and 2009 Unapproved Option Plan
The 2009 Approved Option Plan and the 2009 Unapproved Option Plan, both of which were approved by shareholders at the 
AGM held on 19 May 2009, are used to grant market value options to less senior employees of the Group (excluding those employed  
by the Cairn India Group). The principal difference between these two arrangements is that the approval of HM Revenue & Customs  
was sought and obtained for the 2009 Approved Option Plan, whereas no such approval was sought in relation to the 2009 Unapproved 
Option Plan. Options granted under the 2009 Unapproved Option Plan and 2009 Approved Option Plan are normally exercisable 
between three and 10 years following their grant but only if and to the extent that specified performance conditions have been satisfied.
The value of ordinary shares over which options may be granted to a participant under the 2009 Unapproved Option Plan and  
2009 Approved Option Plan in any financial year is subject to a limit of 200% of his/her basic salary (although a 300% of salary  
limit can be applied to an individual by the remuneration committee in exceptional circumstances).
The first options under the 2009 Unapproved Option Plan and 2009 Approved Option Plan were granted on 29 May 2009, with 
further awards being made to selected employees during 2010. A summary of the performance conditions that will determine  
the extent to which these options vest at the end of the applicable performance period is provided on page 82.
Replacement Option Plan
The Replacement Option Plan, which was approved by shareholders at the EGM on 21 December 2009, was introduced to facilitate 
the conversion of certain options that had previously been granted by the Company under the Cairn Energy PLC Share Option Plan 
2006 (‘2006 Plan’).
The 2006 Plan was established by the Company at the same time as the 2006 LTIP described above. It was designed to enable 
selected employees to be granted options over Capricorn Units (i.e. notional ‘units’ of value relating to the Capricorn Group).
However, due to the same technical issues highlighted above in relation to the 2009 LTIP , the holders of these options over Capricorn 
Units were, during 2009, invited to surrender their rights in exchange for the grant of ‘Converted Options’ over ordinary shares in the 
Company pursuant to the Replacement Option Plan. All participants in the 2006 Plan subsequently accepted this conversion invitation 
and were granted their Converted Options on 22 December 2009. As a result, there are no outstanding options over Capricorn Units 
under the 2006 Plan.
Converted Options granted under the Replacement Option Plan comprise conditional rights to acquire ordinary shares for a 
specified price, the vesting of which is normally dependent on both continued employment with the Group and the extent to which 
pre-determined performance conditions are met over a specified period of three years. The form of these performance conditions, 
and the period over which they are measured, are intended to mirror those that applied to the options over Capricorn Units that have 
been replaced. 73 Cairn Energy PLC Annual Report 2010

performance period is provided on page 82.
No options were granted under the Replacement Option Plan during 2010 and no further awards will be granted pursuant to this 
arrangement in the future.
1996 Option Scheme, 2002 Option Plan and 2003 Option Plan
The 1996 Option Scheme, 2002 Option Plan and 2003 Option Plan (all of which have subsequently been superseded) were formerly 
used by the Company to grant options to a broad selection of employees in the Group. Although a number of options granted under 
these plans currently subsist, no further awards will be granted pursuant to their terms.
A summary of the performance conditions that must be satisfied before awards under these plans can be exercised is provided on 
page 83.
Cairn India schemes
As part of the arrangements surrounding its flotation, Cairn India established its own share option schemes pursuant to which 
options to acquire its shares can be granted. These arrangements have been or will be used to grant options over Cairn India  
shares to selected employees and executive directors of Cairn India and its various subsidiary undertakings.
Dilution of share capital pursuant to share plans
In any 10-year rolling period, the number of ordinary shares which may be issued in connection with the Company’s discretionary 
share plans cannot exceed 5% of the Company’s issued ordinary share capital.
In addition, in any ten-year rolling period, the number of ordinary shares which may be issued in connection with all the Company’s 
employee share schemes (whether discretionary or otherwise) cannot exceed 10% of the Company’s issued ordinary share capital.
It should also be noted that all shares acquired by or awarded to participants under the SIP are existing ordinary shares purchased  
in the market. As a result, the SIP does not involve the issue of new shares or the transfer of treasury shares.
Non-executive directors
The remuneration of each of the non-executive directors (other than the Chairman) is determined by the executive members of the 
Board and the Chairman within limits set out in the Articles of Association and having taken independent advice on appropriate levels. 
The remuneration of the Chairman is determined by the remuneration committee (in his absence), again based on independent advice. 
In all cases, the fees are designed to attract experienced individuals and reflect the increased responsibilities of the role of the Chairman 
and other non-executive directors.
Non-executive directors cannot participate in any of the Company’s long-term incentive arrangements and are not entitled to a 
bonus or pension contributions.
The non-executive directors’ fees for 2010 are set out in full in the remuneration table on page 76. The non-executive directors’  
fees for 2011 were increased by 4% and are £213,000 for Norman Murray and £66,000 for each of the other non-executive directors. 
In addition to this, an annual fee of £10,000 is payable to each of Iain McLaren and Dr James Buckee for their roles as chairman of the 
audit and remuneration committee respectively.
Service contracts/letters of appointment
The Company’s policy is for all executive directors to have contracts of service which can be terminated either by the director concerned 
or by the Company on giving 12 months’ notice of termination. In the event of termination by the Company (other than as a result of a 
change of control), the executive directors would be entitled to loss of salary, benefits and pension contributions for the notice periods. 
Depending on the circumstances of termination, the executive directors may be entitled, or the remuneration committee may exercise its 
discretion to allow the executive director, to retain a proportion of his or her outstanding awards under long-term incentive arrangements 
(but only to the extent that any applicable performance conditions have been met). The committee’s policy on early termination is to 
emphasise the duty of the terminated party to mitigate any loss caused by the early termination to the fullest extent practicable.
On a change of control of the Company resulting in the termination of a director’s employment, each of the directors is entitled to 
compensation of a sum equal to his/her annual basic salary as at the date of termination of employment.
Each of the non-executive directors has a letter of appointment in terms of which he is appointed for a fixed three-year period, 
subject to the Company’s Articles of Association, which provide for retirement by rotation at least once every three years. The letters 
of appointment set out the time commitment expected by the Company and can be terminated with immediate effect by either the 
director concerned or the Company. The Board is satisfied that each of the non-executive directors commits sufficient time to fulfil 
his/her duties as a director of the Company. None of the non-executive directors has any conflict of interest which has not been 
disclosed to the Board in accordance with the Company’s Articles of Association. The executive directors’ service contracts and 
non-executive directors’ letters of appointment are available for inspection on request and will be available for inspection before  
and during the AGM to be held on 19 May 2011. 74 Cairn Energy PLC Annual Report 2010

Notes:
(1) Simon Thomson was appointed a non-executive director of Graham’s The Family Dairy on 5 February 2010. His fees reflect the period from that date to 31 December 2010.
(2) Malcolm Thoms was appointed a non-executive director of Agora Oil & Gas AS on 1 December 2010. His fees are paid in Norwegian Krone.
The Board believes, in principle, in the benefits of executive directors accepting positions as non-executive directors of other 
companies in order to widen their skills and knowledge for the benefit of the Company, provided that the time commitments 
involved are not unduly onerous.
The appointment of any executive director to a non-executive position with another company must be approved by the Board. In the 
case of a proposed appointment to a company within the oil and gas industry, permission will only be given if the two companies do 
not compete in the same geographical area.

Awards vesting during the year – overview
On 8 January 2010, the three-year performance period applicable to certain awards granted under the 2006 LTIP and Replacement LTIP 
came to an end. Shortly thereafter, the remuneration committee determined that the relevant performance conditions (see pages 80 to 
82 for full details) had been met to the following extent:
in the case of the Cairn India Awards granted under the 2006 LTIP , Cairn India’s Total Shareholder Return (TSR) performance  
over the period was ranked between median and upper decile in the applicable comparator group resulting in a vesting of 
approximately 80% of the Cairn India Units over which the awards subsisted; and
in the case of the Converted Awards granted under the Replacement LTIP , the Company’s TSR performance over the period was 
(i) ranked above upper decile in the applicable comparator group; and (ii) in excess of 150%. The 1.33 ‘multiplier’ contained within 
the rules of the Replacement LTIP was therefore applied in full, resulting in a vesting of 133% of the ordinary shares over which the 
awards subsisted.
The calculations used to determine these vesting percentages were carried out by Cairn and independently verified by Ernst & 
Young LLP .
Details of LTIP awards which vested during 2010 pursuant to the 2006 LTIP and Replacement LTIP are given in the tables below.

*  The number of ordinary shares to which a participant became entitled on the vesting of the above Cairn India Awards was calculated by reference to (i) a fair market value per 
Cairn India Limited share of INR 293.15 (being the closing price of such share on the day preceding the vesting date); and (ii) a market value per ordinary share of £3.62 (being 
the closing middle market quotation of an ordinary share on the day preceding the vesting date).
In accordance with the rules of the 2006 LTIP , 50% of the ordinary shares in respect of which the above Cairn India Awards vested 
were released to the executive directors immediately. The remaining 50% of the ordinary shares have been withheld by the trustee  
of the Company’s employee benefit trust (the ‘Trustee’) and will normally be released on the first anniversary of vesting. 79 Cairn Energy PLC Annual Report 2010

*  As explained above, these Converted Awards vested in respect of 133% of the ordinary shares over which they were originally granted as a result of the application of the 1.33 
‘multiplier’ contained within the rules of the Replacement LTIP.
Following the above vesting, a total of 2,247 ,126 ordinary shares acquired by the executive directors’ were sold on their behalf to fund 
the tax and national insurance liabilities arising on vesting. The balance of the ordinary shares acquired are subject to an extended 
holding period during which they will be held by the Trustee as nominee for each of the individuals. This holding period, during which 
the ordinary shares cannot be sold and may be forfeited in certain specified circumstances, will normally expire on 9 January 2013.
Overview of share incentive plan performance conditions
Introduction
The vesting of each award and option granted under the Company’s various share incentive plans is conditional on the achievement 
of performance conditions determined by the remuneration committee at the relevant date of grant. Set out below is a summary of 
the conditions applicable to awards and options that were outstanding during the year.
In the case of the Company’s long-term incentive plans (being the arrangements in which the executive directors participate),  
the conditions principally relate to the TSR performance of the Company. These TSR measures were selected by the remuneration 
committee on the basis that they improve shareholder alignment and are consistent with the Company’s objective of delivering 
long-term value to shareholders.
On the expiry of the performance period applicable to an award or option, the calculations necessary to determine the extent to 
which the relevant conditions have been satisfied are subject to independent verification by Ernst & Young LLP .
2009 LTIP
In the case of all outstanding awards granted under the 2009 LTIP , the extent to which they vest will be determined by comparing the 
TSR of the Company over a three year performance period with the TSR of a share in each company in a comparator group. The tables 
below show the comparator groups for each tranche of awards granted under the 2009 LTIP to executive directors.

2. AUDITED INFORMATION (continued)
Overview of share incentive plan performance conditions (continued)
2009 LTIP (continued)
At the end of the performance period, each company in the comparator group will be listed in order of TSR performance to produce 
a ‘ranking table’. The vesting of awards will then take place as follows:
Ranking of Company against the comparator group Percentage of ordinary shares comprised in Award that vest
Below median 0%
Median 20%
Upper decile (i.e. top 10%) 100%
Between median and upper decile 20% – 100% on a straight line basis
In order to make sure that the 2009 LTIP encourages and rewards exceptional performance, the performance conditions attaching  
to awards also provide that, where the TSR of the Company produces a ranking at or above the upper decile level in the appropriate 
comparator group, a participant will then be given the opportunity to increase the percentage of his/her award that vests through the 
application of a ‘multiplier’ that is linked to the TSR actually achieved over the performance period. The way in which this multiplier 
will operate is as follows:
Multiplier applied to determine the number of  
ordinary shares that actually vest TSR of the Company over the performance period
1 50% or less
1.33 100% or more
1 – 1.33 on a straight line basis Between 50% and 100%
However, notwithstanding the performance of the Company against the above targets, no part of any award will vest unless the 
remuneration committee is satisfied that there has been an overall satisfactory and sustained improvement in the performance  
of the Company as a whole over the performance period.
2006 LTIP (Cairn India Awards)
In the case of all outstanding Cairn India Awards granted under the 2006 LTIP , the extent to which they vest is determined by 
comparing the TSR of a Cairn India share over a three year performance period with the TSR of a share in each company in a 
comparator group. The tables below show the comparator groups for each tranche of Cairn India Awards.

2006 LTIP (Cairn India Awards) (continued)
For the same reasons as noted above in relation to the 2009 LTIP , where the TSR of a Cairn India share produces a ranking at or above 
the upper decile level in the appropriate comparator group, the percentage of the relevant Cairn India Award that vests may be 
increased through the application of the following ‘multiplier’ that is linked to the TSR actually achieved over the performance period:
Multiplier applied to determine the number of  
Cairn India Units that actually vest TSR of Cairn India over the performance period
1 40% or less
1.33 80% or more
1 – 1.33 on a straight line basis Between 40% and 80%
Notwithstanding the performance of a Cairn India share against the above targets, no part of any Cairn India Award vests unless the 
remuneration committee is satisfied that there has been an overall satisfactory and sustained improvement in the performance of the 
Company as a whole over the performance period.
Replacement LTIP
The vesting of a Converted Award is determined by the extent to which specified performance conditions are satisfied over the 
original three year performance period that applied to the 2006 LTIP Capricorn Award that it has replaced pursuant to the conversion 
mechanism described on pages 70 and 71.
The terms of these conditions that apply to each Converted Award are the same as those applied to the Capricorn Award that it has 
replaced. In particular, the extent to which a Converted Award vests is determined by comparing the TSR of the Company over the 
applicable performance period with the TSR of a share in each company in a comparator group (see below) with vesting taking place 
as follows:
 Percentage of ordinary shares comprised 
Ranking of the Company against the comparator group in converted Award that vest
Below median 0%
Median 20%
Upper decile (i.e. top 10%) 100%
Between median and upper decile 20% – 100% on a straight line basis
For the same reasons as noted above in relation to the 2009 LTIP , where the TSR of the Company produces a ranking at or above the 
upper decile level in the appropriate comparator group, the percentage of the relevant Converted Award that vests may be increased 
through the application of the following ‘multiplier’ that is linked to the TSR actually achieved over the performance period:
Multiplier applied to determine the number of  
ordinary shares that actually vest TSR of the Company over the performance period
1 75% or less
1.33 150% or more
1 – 1.33 on a straight line basis Between 75% and 150%
For the purposes of the above conditions, the TSR performance of the Company over the performance period will be calculated by 
aggregating (i) the growth (or fall) in the TSR of a Capricorn Unit achieved between the start of the period and the ‘conversion date’ 
(being the date on which the conversion mechanism described on pages 70 and 71 became effective); and (ii) the growth (or fall) in 
the TSR of a Cairn share between the conversion date and the end of the period.
Notwithstanding the performance of the Company against the above targets, no part of any Converted Award vests unless the 
remuneration committee is satisfied that there has been an overall satisfactory and sustained improvement in the performance  
of the Company as a whole over the performance period. 82 Cairn Energy PLC Annual Report 2010

2009 Approved Option Plan and 2009 Unapproved Option Plan
All options granted under the above arrangements are subject to a TSR growth target measured over a three year performance 
period. Under this target, vesting will occur as follows:
Average annual compound growth in TSR of the  
Company over the performance period Percentage of ordinary shares comprised in option that vests
Less than 5% 0%
5% 50%
10% or more 100%
More than 5% but less than 10% 50% – 100% on a straight line basis
Notwithstanding the above condition, no part of an option granted under the 2009 Approved Option Plan or 2009 Unapproved 
Option Plan will vest unless the TSR of the Company over the performance period is sufficient to place it at or above the median  
level in the same comparator group of companies that is used for the purposes of the 2009 LTIP (see table on page 79).
Replacement Option Plan
The vesting of a Converted Option will be determined by the extent to which specified performance conditions are satisfied over  
the original three year performance period that applied to the 2006 Plan Capricorn Unit option that it has replaced pursuant to the 
exchange mechanism described on page 72.
The terms of these conditions that apply to each Converted Option are the same as those applied to the Capricorn Unit option  
that it has replaced. In particular, the extent to which a Converted Option vests will be determined by reference to the Company’s 
achievement against a share price growth target measured over the applicable performance period. Under this target, vesting will 
occur as follows:
Average annual compound growth in the price Percentage of ordinary shares comprised 
of a Cairn share over the performance period in Converted Option that vests
Less than 5% 0%
5% 50%
10% or more 100%
More than 5% but less than 10% 50% – 100% on a straight line basis
Notwithstanding the above condition, no part of a Converted Option vests unless the TSR of the Company over the performance 
period is sufficient to place it at or above the median level in the same comparator group of companies that is used for the purposes 
of the Converted Awards granted under the Replacement LTIP (see the table above). 83 Cairn Energy PLC Annual Report 2010

This report is made solely to the company’s members, as a body, in accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies Act 2006. 
Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might state to the company’s members those matters we are required to state to them 
in an auditor’s report and for no other purpose. To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility to 
anyone other than the company and the company’s members as a body, for our audit work, for this report, or for the opinions we

RESPECTIVE RESPONSIBILITIES OF DIRECTORS AND AUDITOR
As explained more fully in the Directors’ Responsibilities Statement set out on page 65, the directors are responsible for the 
preparation of the financial statements and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view. Our responsibility is to audit  
and express an opinion on the financial statements in accordance with applicable law and International Standards on Auditing  
(UK and Ireland). Those standards require us to comply with the Auditing Practices Board’s Ethical Standards for Auditors.
SCOPE OF THE AUDIT OF THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
An audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements sufficient to give reasonable 
assurance that the financial statements are free from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or error. This includes an 
assessment of: whether the accounting policies are appropriate to the group’s and the parent company’s circumstances and have 
been consistently applied and adequately disclosed; the reasonableness of significant accounting estimates made by the directors; 
and the overall presentation of the financial statements.
OPINION ON FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
In our opinion:
The financial statements give a true and fair view of the state of the group’s and of the parent company’s affairs as at 31 December 
2010 and of the group’s profit for the year then ended;
The group financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the European Union; and 
The parent company financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the European 
Union and as applied in accordance with the provisions of the Companies Act 2006; and
The financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006 and, as regards the 
group financial statements, Article 4 of the IAS Regulation.
OPINION ON OTHER MATTERS PRESCRIBED BY THE COMPANIES ACT 2006
In our opinion:
The part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited has been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 
2006; and
The information given in the Directors’ Report for the financial year for which the financial statements are prepared is consistent 
with the financial statements.
MATTERS ON WHICH WE ARE REQUIRED TO REPORT BY EXCEPTION
We have nothing to report in respect of the following:
Under the Companies Act 2006 we are required to report to you if, in our opinion:
Adequate accounting records have not been kept by the parent company, or returns adequate for our audit have not been 
received from branches not visited by us; or
The parent company financial statements and the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited are not in agreement 
with the accounting records and returns; or
Certain disclosures of directors’ remuneration specified by law are not made; or
We have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit.
Under the Listing Rules we are required to review:
The directors’ statement, set out on page 65, in relation to going concern;
The part of the Corporate Governance Statement relating to the company’s compliance with the nine provisions of the June 2008 
Combined Code specified for our review; and

1 ACCOUNTING POLICIES
a) Basis of preparation
The consolidated financial statements of Cairn Energy PLC (‘Cairn’ or ‘the Group’) for the year ended 31 December 2010 were 
authorised for issue in accordance with a resolution of the directors on 21 March 2011. The Group is a limited company incorporated 
and domiciled in the United Kingdom whose shares are publically traded. The registered office is located at 50 Lothian Road, 
Edinburgh, Scotland.
Cairn prepares its accounts on a historical cost basis. Where there are assets and liabilities calculated on a different basis, this fact is 
disclosed in the relevant accounting policy. 
Cairn has changed its accounting policy for the valuation of inventory. The Group’s policy is now to do so at the lower of cost or net 
realisable value; previously, inventories of oil and condensate were valued at estimated selling price. See Note 35a for further details 
and the impact of this change on comparatives. 
b) Accounting standards
Cairn prepares its accounts in accordance with applicable International Financial Reporting Standards (‘IFRS’) as adopted by the EU. 
The Group’s financial statements are also consistent with IFRS as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (‘IASB’) as 
they apply to accounting periods ended 31 December 2010. 
For the year ending 31 December 2010, Cairn has adopted the following standards and interpretations:
Title Change to accounting policy Impact on initial application
Amendment to IFRS 2 ‘Group-Settled 
Share-based Payment Arrangements’
Amendments to the definitions of 
share-based payment transactions,  
the scope of IFRS 2 and accounting  
for group cash-settled share-based 
payment transactions.
No impact on the financial position  
or performance of the Group. Refer  
to Note 35(b) for the impact on the 
Company.
IFRS 3 ‘Business Combinations (revised)’ Significant changes to accounting for 
business combinations including the 
non-capitalisation of acquisition costs, 
recognition of contingent liabilities at 
fair values and re-measurement of 
deferred consideration at subsequent 
reporting dates.
Changes in accounting policy are 
prospective and therefore there is  
no impact on the financial position  
or performance of the Group.
IFRS 5 ‘Non-current Assets Held-for-sale 
and Discontinued Operations’ 
Clarifies the disclosures required for 
non-current assets, disposal groups 
classified as held-for-sale and 
discontinued operations.
Disclosures given in Note 3 to these 
accounts comply with revised standard.
IFRS 8 ‘Operating Segments’ Segment assets and liabilities need only 
be reported when they are included in 
measures used by the chief operating 
decision maker.
No impact on the financial position  
or performance of the Group.
IAS 1 ‘Presentation of Financial Statements’ Amendments to the classification of 
convertible instruments.
No impact on the financial position or 
performance of the Group or Company. 
IAS 7 ‘Statement of Cash Flows’ Explicitly states that only expenditure  
that results in a recognised asset can  
be classified as investing activities.
No impact on the financial position or 
performance of the Group.
IAS 27 ‘Consolidated and Separate 
Financial Statements (amended)’
Changes in ownership interests of a 
subsidiary undertaking which do not 
result in a change of control are to be 
recognised through equity.
A disposal of a non-controlling interest in 
subsidiary undertakings is now recognised 
in equity with neither a gain arising in profit 
or loss, nor goodwill being recorded in the 
Balance Sheet.
IAS 36 ‘Impairment of Assets’ Clarification that the largest unit for 
allocating goodwill acquired in a business 
combination is the operating segment 
before segments are combined into a 
single reportable segment.
Goodwill arising on the acquisition of the 
Group’s Mediterranean assets has been 
impaired. See Note 16.

1 ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued)
b) Accounting standards (continued)
Other amendments to IFRS effective during the year but with no impact on the accounting policies, financial position or performance 
of the Group were as follows:
IAS 17 ‘Leases’;
IAS 18 ‘Revenue; 
IAS 38 ‘Intangible Assets’;
Amendment to IAS 39 ‘Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement’;
IFRIC 12 ‘Service Concession Arrangements’;
IFRIC 15 ‘Agreements for the Construction of Real Estate’;
IFRIC 17 ‘Distributions of Non-cash Assets to Owners’; and
IFRIC 18 ‘Transfers of Assets from Customers’.
The following new standards and interpretations, which are not yet effective and which are not expected to impact on the Group’s 
financial position or performance, have been issued by the IASB:
IFRS 9 ‘Financial Instruments: Classification and Measurement’;
IAS 24 (Revised) ‘Related Party Disclosures’; 
Improvements to IFRS 7 ‘Transfers of Financial Assets’;
Amendment to IAS 12 ‘Deferred Tax: Recovery of Underlying Assets’;
Amendment to IAS 32 ‘Classification of Rights Issues’; and
IFRIC 19 ‘Extinguishment of Financial Liabilities with Equity Instruments’.
c) Presentation currency
The functional currency of Cairn Energy PLC, the ultimate parent company of the Group, is Sterling. These accounts have been 
presented in US Dollars ($), the functional currency of most companies within the Group. It is deemed to be more appropriate to 
present the financial statements in line with the functional currency of the majority of the Group. The Group’s policy on foreign 
currencies is detailed in Note 1(q).
d) Basis of consolidation
The consolidated accounts include the results of Cairn Energy PLC and its subsidiary undertakings to the Balance Sheet date.  
The results of subsidiaries acquired or disposed of during the year are included in the Income Statement and Statement of Cash 
Flows from the effective date of acquisition or up to the effective date of disposal as appropriate.
Cairn allocates the purchase consideration of any acquisition to assets and liabilities on the basis of fair values at the date of acquisition. 
Any excess of the cost of acquisition over the fair values of the assets and liabilities is recognised as goodwill. Any goodwill arising is 
recognised as an asset and is subject to annual review for impairment. Goodwill is written off where circumstances indicate that the 
value of the underlying cash generating unit including the asset may no longer support the carrying value of goodwill. Any such 
impairment loss arising is recognised in the Income Statement for the year. Impairment losses relating to goodwill cannot be reversed  
in future periods. Negative goodwill is credited immediately to the Income Statement.
Cairn has used the exemption granted under s408 of the Companies Act 2006 that allows for the non-disclosure of the Income 
Statement of the parent company. The profit attributable to the Company for the year ended 31 December 2010 was $150.2m  
(2009: loss of $57 .0m).
e) Joint Ventures
Cairn participates in several unincorporated Joint Ventures which involve the joint control of assets used in the Group’s oil and gas 
exploration and producing activities. Cairn accounts for its share of assets, liabilities, income and expenditure of Joint Ventures in 
which the Group holds an interest, classified in the appropriate Balance Sheet and Income Statement headings. Cairn’s principal 
licence interests are jointly controlled assets.
A list of Cairn’s interests in unincorporated Joint Ventures is given on page 25.
f) Revenue and other income
Revenue from operating activities
Revenue represents Cairn’s share of oil, gas and condensate production, recognised on a direct entitlement basis, and tariff income 
received for third party use of operating facilities and pipelines in accordance with agreements.
Other income
Income received as operator from Joint Ventures is recognised on an accruals basis in accordance with Joint Venture agreements and  
is included within ‘Other operating income’ in the Income Statement. Interest income is recognised using the effective interest method 
on an accruals basis and is recognised within ‘Finance income’ in the Income Statement.

g) Intangible exploration/appraisal assets and property, plant & equipment – development/producing assets
Cairn follows a successful efforts based accounting policy for oil and gas assets. 
Costs incurred prior to obtaining the legal rights to explore an area are expensed immediately to the Income Statement.
Expenditure incurred on the acquisition of a licence interest is initially capitalised on a licence-by-licence basis. Costs are held,  
un-depleted, within intangible exploration/appraisal assets until such time as the exploration phase on the licence area is complete  
or commercial reserves have been discovered. 
Exploration expenditure incurred in the process of determining oil and gas exploration targets is capitalised initially within intangible 
exploration/appraisal assets and subsequently allocated to drilling activities. Exploration/appraisal drilling costs are initially capitalised 
on a well-by-well basis until the success or otherwise of the well has been established. The success or failure of each exploration/
appraisal effort is judged on a well-by-well basis. Drilling costs are written off on completion of a well unless the results indicate  
that hydrocarbon reserves exist and there is a reasonable prospect that these reserves are commercial. 
Following appraisal of successful exploration wells, if commercial reserves are established and technical feasibility for extraction 
demonstrated, then the related capitalised intangible exploration/appraisal costs are transferred into a single field cost centre within 
property, plant & equipment – development/producing assets after testing for impairment (see below). Where results of exploration 
drilling indicate the presence of hydrocarbons which are ultimately not considered commercially viable, all related costs are written  
off to the Income Statement. 
All costs incurred after the technical feasibility and commercial viability of producing hydrocarbons has been demonstrated are 
capitalised within property, plant & equipment – development/producing assets on a field-by-field basis. Subsequent expenditure is 
capitalised only where it either enhances the economic benefits of the development/producing asset or replaces part of the existing 
development/producing asset. Any remaining costs associated with the part replaced are expensed.
Net proceeds from any disposal of an intangible exploration/appraisal asset are initially credited against the previously capitalised 
costs. Any surplus proceeds are credited to the Income Statement. Net proceeds from any disposal of development/producing 
assets are credited against the previously capitalised cost. A gain or loss on disposal of a development/producing asset is recognised 
in the Income Statement to the extent that the net proceeds exceed or are less than the appropriate portion of the net capitalised 
costs of the asset.
Depletion
Cairn depletes separately, where applicable, any significant components within property, plant & equipment – development/
producing assets, such as fields, processing facilities and pipelines, which are significant in relation to the total cost of a 
development/producing asset. 
Cairn depletes expenditure on property, plant & equipment – development/producing assets on a unit-of-production basis, based 
on proved and probable reserves on a field-by-field basis. In certain circumstances, fields within a single development area may be 
combined for depletion purposes.
Impairment
Intangible exploration/appraisal assets are reviewed regularly for indicators of impairment following the guidance in IFRS 6 
‘Exploration for and Evaluation of Mineral Resources’ and tested for impairment where such indicators exist. In such circumstances 
the exploration/appraisal asset is allocated to property, plant & equipment – development/producing assets within the same 
operating segment and tested for impairment. Any impairment arising is recognised in the Income Statement for the year. Where 
there are no development/producing assets within an operating segment, the exploration/appraisal costs are charged immediately 
to the Income Statement. 
Impairment reviews on property, plant & equipment – development/producing assets are carried out on each cash-generating unit 
identified in accordance with IAS 36 ‘Impairment of Assets’. Cairn’s cash-generating units are those assets which generate largely 
independent cash flows and are normally, but not always, single development areas. 
At each reporting date, where there are indicators of impairment, the net book value of the cash-generating unit is compared with 
the associated expected discounted future net cash flows. If the net book value is higher, then the difference is written off to the 
Income Statement as impairment. Discounted future net cash flows for IAS 36 purposes are calculated using an estimated short  
and long-term oil price of $75/bbl (2009: short and long-term oil price of $65/bbl), or the appropriate gas price as dictated by the 
relevant gas sales contract, escalation for prices and costs of 3%, and a pre-tax discount rate of between 10% and 12% (2009: 3% 
and 10% respectively). Forecast production profiles are determined on an asset-by-asset basis, using appropriate petroleum 
engineering techniques. 
Where there has been a charge for impairment in an earlier period, that charge will be reversed in a later period where there has  
been a change in circumstance to the extent that the discounted future net cash flows are higher than the net book value at the  
time. In reversing impairment losses, the carrying amount of the asset will be increased to the lower of its original carrying value  
or the carrying value that would have been determined (net of depletion) had no impairment loss been recognised in prior periods. 94 Cairn Energy PLC Annual Report 2010
NOTES TO THE ACCOUNTS

h) Property, plant & equipment – other
Property, plant and equipment are measured at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment and depreciated over their 
expected useful economic lives as follows:
      Annual Depreciation  
      rate (%) method
Tenants’ improvements      10 – 33* straight line
Vehicles and equipment      25 – 50* straight line
* Depreciation is charged over the shorter of the economic life or the remaining term of the lease.
i) Intangible assets – other
Intangible assets have finite useful lives, are measured at cost less accumulated amortisation and impairment, and amortised over 
their expected useful economic lives as follows:
      Annual Amortisation  
      rate (%) method
Software costs      25 – 50 straight line
Goodwill arising on business combinations is not amortised but is tested annually for impairment. See Note 1(d).
j) Investments
The Company’s investments in subsidiaries are carried at cost less provisions resulting from impairment. The recoverable value of 
investments is the higher of its fair value less costs to sell and value in use. Value in use is based on the discounted future net cash 
flows of the oil and gas assets held by the subsidiary.
Discounted future net cash flows for IAS 36 purposes are calculated using an estimated short and long-term oil price of $75/bbl 
(2009: short and long-term oil price of $65/bbl) or the appropriate gas price as dictated by the relevant gas sales contract, escalation 
for prices and costs of 3%, and a discount rate of 7% (2009: 3% and 10% respectively). Forecast production profiles are determined 
on an asset-by-asset basis, using appropriate petroleum engineering techniques.
k) Inventory
Inventories of oil and condensate held at the Balance Sheet date are valued at the lower of cost or net realisable value based on the 
estimated selling price.
l) Assets and liabilities held-for-sale 
Non-current assets and disposal groups and related liabilities are classified as held-for-sale where it is highly probable that their carrying 
amount will be recovered principally through a sale transaction rather than through continuing use. Where a disposal group classified as 
held-for-sale represents a separate major line of business or geographical area of operation, it is presented as a discontinued operation 
in the Income Statement. A sale is considered highly probable where buyers have been identified and the sale transaction is expected 
to be complete within one year from the date of classification. 
Assets held-for-sale are measured at the lower of cost or fair value less cost to sell. Any depletion, depreciation or amortisation 
charges against the asset cease at the date of classification.
m) Financial instruments
A financial instrument is any contract that gives rise to a financial asset of one entity and a financial liability or equity instrument of 
another entity. 
Financial assets are categorised as financial assets held at fair value through profit or loss, held-to-maturity investments, loans and 
receivables and available-for-sale financial assets. The Group holds financial assets which are classified as either available-for-sale 
financial assets or loans and receivables, with the exception of derivative financial instruments which are held at fair value through 
profit or loss. 
Financial liabilities generally substantiate claims for repayment in cash or another financial asset. Financial liabilities are categorised  
as either fair value through profit or loss or held at amortised cost. All of the Group’s financial liabilities are held at amortised cost, 
with the exception of derivative financial instruments which are held at fair value through profit or loss. 
Financial instruments are generally recognised as soon as the Group becomes party to the contractual regulations of the financial 
instrument.
Derivative financial instruments
The Group uses derivative financial instruments such as foreign currency options to hedge its risks associated with foreign currency 
fluctuations. Such derivative financial instruments are designated upon initial recognition as at fair value through profit or loss. The 
derivative financial instruments are initially recognised at fair value on the date on which a derivative contract is entered into and are 
subsequently remeasured at fair value. Derivatives are carried as assets when the fair value is positive and as liabilities when the fair 
value is negative. 95

m) Financial instruments (continued)
Derivative financial instruments (continued)
Any gains or losses arising from changes in fair value on derivatives during the year are taken directly to the Income Statement.  
The Group did not apply hedge accounting for derivative financial instruments held during the current and prior year.
Available-for-sale financial assets
Available-for-sale financial assets are those non-derivative financial assets that are not classified as loans and receivables. Movements 
in the fair value during the year are recognised directly in equity and are disclosed in the Statements of Comprehensive Income. 
The cumulative gain or loss that arises on subsequent disposal of available-for-sale financial assets will be recycled through the 
Income Statement.
Loans and other receivables
Trade receivables, loans and other receivables that have fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted on an active market are 
classified as ‘loans and receivables’. Loans and receivables are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method less 
any impairment. Trade and other receivables are recognised when invoiced. Interest income is recognised by applying the effective 
interest rate, except for short-term receivables where the recognition of interest would be immaterial.
The carrying amounts of loans and other receivables are tested at each reporting date to determine whether there is objective 
material evidence of impairment, for example overdue trade debt. Any impairment losses are recognised through the use of an 
allowance account. When a trade receivable is uncollectible, it is written off against the allowance account. Subsequent recoveries  
of amounts previously written off are credited against the allowance account. Changes in the carrying amount of the allowance 
account are recognised in the Income Statement or Balance Sheet in accordance with where the original receivable was recognised.
Bank deposits
Bank deposits with an original maturity of over three months are held as a separate category of current asset and presented on  
the face of the Balance Sheet.
Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash at bank and short-term deposits with an original maturity of three months or less.
For the purposes of the Group Statements of Cash Flows, cash and cash equivalents consist of cash and cash equivalents as defined 
above, net of outstanding bank overdrafts.
Trade payables and other non-derivative financial liabilities
Trade payables and other creditors are non-interest bearing and are measured at cost.
Interest bearing bank loans and borrowings
All interest bearing bank loans and borrowings represent amounts drawn under the Group’s revolving credit facilities, classified 
according to the length of time remaining under the respective facility. Loans are initially measured at fair value less directly 
attributable transaction costs. After initial recognition, interest bearing loans are subsequently measured at amortised cost  
using the effective interest method. Interest payable is accrued in the Income Statement using the effective interest rate method.
Finance leases
Assets held under finance leases are recognised as assets of the Group at their fair value at the inception of the lease or, if lower,  
at the present value of the minimum lease payments. The corresponding liability to the lessor is included in the Balance Sheet as a 
finance lease obligation. Lease payments are apportioned between finance charges and reduction of the lease obligation so as to 
achieve a constant rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability. Finance charges are charged to the Income Statement, 
unless they are directly attributable to qualifying assets, in which case they are capitalised in accordance with the Group’s general 
policy on borrowing costs (see below).
The Group has reviewed the terms and conditions of the lease arrangements and determined that all risks and rewards of ownership 
lie with the Group and has therefore accounted for the contracts as finance leases.
Borrowing costs
Borrowing costs are recognised in the Income Statement in the period in which they are incurred except for borrowing costs incurred 
on borrowings directly attributable to development projects which are capitalised within the property, plant & equipment – 
development/producing asset.
n) Equity
Equity instruments issued by Cairn are recorded at the proceeds received, net of direct issue costs, allocated between share capital 
and share premium. 96 Cairn Energy PLC Annual Report 2010
NOTES TO THE ACCOUNTS 
(continued)
1 ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued)
o) Taxation
The tax expense represents the sum of current tax and deferred tax.
The current tax is based on taxable profit for the year. Taxable profit differs from net profit as reported in the Income Statement 
because it excludes items of income or expense that are taxable or deductible in other years and it further excludes items that are 
never taxable or deductible. The Group’s liability for current tax is calculated using tax rates that have been enacted or substantively 
enacted by the Balance Sheet date. 
Deferred tax is the tax expected to be payable or recoverable on differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities  
in the financial statements and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable profit.
Deferred income tax liabilities are recognised for all taxable temporary differences except in respect of taxable temporary differences 
associated with investments in subsidiaries, associates and interests in Joint Ventures where the timing of the reversal of the temporary 
difference can be controlled and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future. A deferred 
income tax liability is not recognised if a temporary difference arises on initial recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction that  
is not a business combination and, at the time of the transaction, affects neither the accounting profit nor taxable profit or loss.
Deferred income tax assets are recognised for all deductible temporary differences, carry forward of unused tax assets and unused  
tax losses, to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available against which the deductible temporary differences,  
carry forward of unused tax assets and unused tax losses can be utilised, except where the deferred income tax asset relating to the 
deductible temporary timing difference arises from the initial recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction that is not a business 
combination and, at the time of the transaction, affects neither the accounting profit nor taxable profit or loss. In respect of deductible 
temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries, associates and interests in Joint Ventures, deferred tax assets are only 
recognised to the extent that it is probable that the temporary differences will reverse in the foreseeable future and taxable profits will 
be available against which the temporary differences can be utilised.
The carrying amount of deferred income tax assets are reviewed at each Balance Sheet date and reduced to the extent that it is no 
longer probable that sufficient taxable profits will be available to allow all or part of the deferred income tax asset to be utilised.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the periods in which the asset is realised 
or the liability is settled, based on tax rates and laws enacted or substantively enacted at the Balance Sheet date.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are only offset where they arise within the same entity and tax jurisdiction and the Group intends 
either to settle on a net basis, or to realise the asset and settle the liability simultaneously. 
p) Decommissioning
At the end of the producing life of a field, costs are incurred in removing and decommissioning production facilities. Cairn recognises 
the full discounted cost of dismantling and decommissioning as an asset and liability when the obligation arises. The decommissioning 
asset is included within property, plant & equipment – development/producing assets with the cost of the related installation. The 
liability is included within provisions. Revisions to the estimated costs of decommissioning which alter the level of the provisions required 
are also reflected in adjustments to the decommissioning asset. The amortisation of the asset, calculated on a unit-of-production basis 
based on proved and probable reserves, is included in the ‘Depletion and decommissioning charge’ in the Income Statement, and the 
unwinding of the discount on the provision is included within ‘Finance costs’.
q) Foreign currencies 
In the accounts of individual Group companies, Cairn translates foreign currency transactions into the functional currency at the rate 
of exchange prevailing at the transaction date. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currency are translated into  
the functional currency at the rate of exchange prevailing at the Balance Sheet date. Exchange differences arising are taken to the 
Income Statement except for those incurred on borrowings specifically allocable to development projects, which are capitalised  
as part of the cost of the asset.
The Group maintains the accounts of the parent and subsidiary undertakings in their functional currency. Where applicable, the 
Group translates parent and subsidiary accounts into the presentation currency, $, using the closing rate method for assets and 
liabilities which are translated into $ at the rate of exchange prevailing at the Balance Sheet date and rates at the date of transactions 
for Income Statement accounts. Cairn takes exchange differences arising on the translation of net assets of Group companies whose 
functional currency is non $ directly to reserves. 
Rates of exchange to $1 were as follows:
    31 December Average 31 December Average 
    2010 2010 2009 2009
Sterling    0.641 0.647 0.619 0.639

r) Employee benefits
Pension schemes
Cairn operates defined contribution pension schemes in the UK and India. The assets of the schemes are held separately from those of 
Cairn and its subsidiaries. Cairn also operates insured benefit schemes for certain Indian and Bangladeshi employees as required under 
local legislation. In accordance with IAS 19 ‘Employee Benefits’ these are treated as defined contribution schemes. The pension cost 
charged represents contributions payable in the year in accordance with the rules of the schemes.
Share schemes
The cost of awards to employees under Cairn’s LTIP and share option plans, granted after 7 November 2002, are recognised over  
the three year period to which the performance relates. The amount recognised is based on the fair value of the shares as measured 
at the date of the award. The shares are valued using either the Black Scholes or binomial model, further details of which are given in 
Note 27 .
The cost of equity-settled transactions is recognised, together with a corresponding increase in equity, over the period in which the 
performance and/or service conditions are fulfilled, ending on the date on which the relevant employees become fully entitled to the 
award (‘the vesting date’). The cumulative expense recognised for equity-settled transactions at each reporting date until the vesting 
date reflects the extent to which the vesting period has expired and the Company’s best estimate of the number of equity instruments 
that will ultimately vest. The Income Statement charge or credit for a period represents the movement in cumulative expense as 
recognised at the beginning and end of that period.
No expense is recognised for awards that do not ultimately vest, except for awards where vesting is conditional upon a market 
condition, which are treated as vesting irrespective of whether or not the market condition is satisfied, provided that all other 
performance conditions are satisfied.
Where the terms of an equity-settled award are modified, the minimum expense recognised is the expense as if the terms had not 
been modified. An additional expense is recognised for any modification, which increases the total fair value of the share-based 
payment arrangement, or is otherwise beneficial to the employee as measured at the date of modification.
Where an equity-settled award is cancelled, it is treated as if it had vested on the date of cancellation, and any expense not yet 
recognised for the award is recognised immediately. However, if a new award is substituted for the cancelled award, and designated 
as a replacement award on the date that it is granted, the cancelled and new awards are treated as if they were a modification of the 
original award, as described in the previous paragraph. 
Shares acquired to meet awards under these shares schemes are held by the ESOP Trust. The accounts of the ESOP Trust are 
aggregated into these financial statements. 
The costs of awards to employees, in the form of cash but based on share performance (phantom options) are recognised over the 
period to which the performance relates. The amount recognised is based on the fair value of the liability arising from the transaction.
Termination benefits
Cairn recognises a liability for termination benefits at the point where the Group is committed to making the payments in return for 
employee redundancy.
s) Operating lease commitments
Cairn charges rentals payable under operating leases to the Income Statement on a straight line basis over the lease term. The Group 
has reviewed the terms and conditions of the lease arrangements and determined that all risks and rewards of ownership lie with the 
lessor and has therefore accounted for the contracts as operating leases.
t) Exceptional items
The Group presents as exceptional items on the face of the Income Statement, those material items of income and expense which, 
because of the nature and expected infrequency of the events giving rise to them, merit separate presentation to allow shareholders 
to understand better the elements of financial performance in the year, so as to facilitate comparison with prior periods and to assess 
better the trends in financial performance.
u) Significant accounting judgements, estimates and assumptions
Judgements
In the process of applying Cairn’s accounting policies, the Group has made the following judgements, which have the most significant 
accounting impact in the consolidated financial results:
Assets held-for-sale and discontinued operations
Cairn has entered into an agreement with Vedanta to sell a controlling interest in its subsidiary, Cairn India Limited. Shareholder approval 
has been unanimously received and the deal will complete on approval from GoI and Joint Venture partners. At 31 December 2010 
Cairn believed that all necessary approvals would be received within a time-frame which would allow this transaction to complete on  
its original terms. Therefore all assets and liabilities of the Cairn India Group have been classified as a disposal group held-for-sale.  
The results of the Cairn India Group have been included within discontinued operations. 98 Cairn Energy PLC Annual Report 2010

Key estimations and assumptions
The Group has used estimates and assumptions in arriving at certain figures within the financial statements. The resulting accounting 
estimates may not equate with the actual results which will only be known in time. Those areas believed to be key areas of estimation 
are noted below, with further details of the assumptions contained in the relevant note.
Oil and gas reserves 
Cairn estimates oil and gas reserves on a proved and probable entitlement interest basis. Gross reserve estimates are based on 
forecast production profiles over the remaining life of the field, determined on an asset-by-asset basis, using appropriate petroleum 
engineering techniques. Net entitlement reserve estimates are subsequently calculated using the Group’s current oil price and cost 
recovery assumptions. Estimated reserve quantities are given in the Reserves table on page 141.
Impairment testing
Discounted future net cash flows for IAS 36 purposes are calculated using commodity price, cost and discount rate assumptions on 
forecast production profiles. See Notes 1(d), 1(g), 1(j) and 1(m) for further details.
Depletion 
Depletion charges are calculated on a field-by-field basis using oil and gas reserve estimates and future capital cost assumptions. 
Depletion ceases on assets held-for-sale at the date of classification. See Note 1(g) and 1(l).
Decommissioning estimates
The Group’s provision for decommissioning oil and gas assets is based on current estimates of the costs for removing and 
decommissioning producing facilities, the forecast timing of settlement of decommissioning liabilities and the appropriate discount 
rate. See Note 25.
Share-based payments
Charges for share-based payments are based on the fair value at the date of the award. The shares are valued using appropriate 
modelling techniques and inputs to the models include assumptions on leaver rates, trigger points, discounts rates and volatility.  
See Note 27 .
Deferred tax
The tax base used in the calculation of deferred tax on the Group’s Indian assets changed during the year to reflect the classification 
of the assets and liabilities of the Cairn India Group as a disposal group held-for-sale rather than as assets held for continued use. 
Details on further estimates and assumptions used in calculating deferred tax liabilities are given in Note 1(o).

3 DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS AND ASSETS HELD-FOR-SALE
On 16 August, Cairn announced the conditional agreement with Vedanta, for the sale of a maximum 51% of the fully-diluted share 
capital of Cairn India. Shareholder approval from both parties has been obtained and, although regulatory approval and Joint 
Venture partner approval is required to complete the proposed transaction, as at 31 December 2010 Cairn believed the necessary 
approvals would be received and has classified the assets and liabilities of the Cairn India Group as a disposal group held-for-sale.
The size of the interest in Cairn India sold by Cairn may be reduced down to 40% of the fully-diluted share capital of Cairn India. 
Immediately following completion, Cairn is expected to have a residual interest of between approximately 10.6% and 21.6% of  
the fully-diluted share capital of Cairn India, while Vedanta will hold a controlling 51% interest. Cairn is expected to receive a cash 
consideration of between $6.6bn (40% sold) and $8.5bn (51% sold), depending on both the number of shares comprised within  
the fully-diluted share capital of Cairn India at completion and the size of the interest in Cairn India sold to Vedanta pursuant to  
the proposed transaction. 
On 20 December 2010, Santos International Holdings Pty Limited agreed to purchase the entire share capital of Cairn Energy Sangu 
Field Limited, which holds 37 .5% interest in the producing Sangu gas field, offshore Bangladesh, and a 50% interest in Block 16 
exploration acreage for a consideration of $0.8m. As a result of this transaction Cairn no longer has operations in Bangladesh. 99

Other assets held-for-sale represents intangible exploration/appraisal assets of $1.5m on the proposed sale of the Group’s Nabeul 
permit in Tunisia.
Included in loans and borrowings of $673.7m are debenture and loan balances. In October 2010 Cairn India raised $500m through 
INR Unsecured Non-convertible Debentures, at competitive commercial terms. $301.9m was drawn at the year end and the balance 
is available to drawdown subject to certain conditions. 
In October 2009, the Cairn India Group completed a $1.6bn re-financing for the Rajasthan project through a combination of $750m 
international US dollar borrowings (‘USD Facility’) and a domestic borrowing (‘INR Facility’) of INR 40bn ($850m). The domestic 
borrowing programme was given ‘AAA’ by CARE.
The USD Facility of $750m was provided by a consortium of overseas commercial banks led by Standard Chartered Bank and the 
International Finance Corporation, a member of the World Bank Group. Of the full $750.0m facility $371.8m was drawn at 31 December 
2010. Cairn India may cancel and repay the facility at any time. Under the terms of the facility agreement, security in terms of share 
pledge over the shares in Cairn Energy Hydrocarbons Limited (a 100% indirect subsidiary of Cairn India Limited which holds 50%  
of the Group’s interest in Rajasthan) has been provided. 
The INR Facility was underwritten by the State Bank of India, who syndicated to other banks and financial institutions, including 
Canara Bank, Bank of India, Oriental Bank of Commerce, Bank of Baroda, HDFC Bank and Infrastructure Development and Finance 
Corporation. Cairn India settled and cancelled the INR facility following the Debenture issue. 
Assets held-for-sale as at 31 December 2009 were as follows:

3 DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS AND ASSETS HELD-FOR-SALE (continued)
As part settlement of the minority buy-back from Dyas in 2009, Cairn agreed to transfer to Dyas a 15% interest in the Louza licence 
and a 7 .5% interest in the Nabeul licence, both offshore Tunisia, and a 15% interest in the Joni-5 block offshore Albania. The three 
transfers were subject to approval from the respective Governments which were received during 2010. 
On 31 December 2009, Cairn entered into an agreement with Oil Search Limited for the sale of the Group’s 12.73% interest in Block 
PRL-1, Papua New Guinea. This transaction was subject to Government approval which was received during 2010 and a gain on sale 
was recognised in the current year (see Note 5c). 
As none of the required approvals in the above transactions had been received at 31 December 2009 the assets were classified as 
held-for-sale.

In addition to the assets and liabilities of the Cairn India disposal unit held-for-sale, the following contingent liabilities are not 
recognised in the financial statements:
Indian service tax
One of the subsidiary companies of the Cairn India Group has received five show cause notices from the tax authorities in India for 
non-payment of service tax as a recipient of services from foreign suppliers.
These notices cover periods from 16 August 2002 to 31 March 2010. A writ petition has been filed with Chennai High Court challenging 
the liability to pay service tax as recipient of services in respect of the first show cause notice (16 August 2002 to 31 March 2006) and 
another challenging the scope of some services in respect of the second show cause notice (1 April 2006 to 31 March 2007). Writ 
petitions for the first show cause notice were decided in favour of the subsidiary company resulting in a quashing of the demand  
notice of $10.6m (INR 475m). The writ petition for the second show cause notice is expected to come up for hearing in 2011.
The reply for the third and fourth show cause notice has also been filed before the authorities. The reply to the fifth show cause 
notice is in process and will be submitted shortly.
Should future adjudications go against the Cairn India Group, it will be liable to pay the service tax of approximately $28.7m  
(INR 1.3bn) plus potential interest to date of approximately $9.5m (INR 425m), although this could be recovered in part where  
it relates to services provided to the Joint Venture of which Cairn India is operator.
Indian tax holiday on gas production
Section 80-IB(9) of the Income Tax Act, 1961 allows the deduction of 100% of profits from the commercial production or refining  
of mineral oil. The term ‘mineral oil’ is not defined but has always been understood to refer to both oil and gas, either separately  
or collectively. The 2008 Indian Finance Bill appeared to remove this deduction by stating without amending section 80-IB(9) that 
“for the purpose of section 80-IB(9), the term ‘mineral oil’ does not include petroleum and natural gas, unlike in other sections of  
the Act”. Subsequent announcements by the Finance Minister and the Ministry of Petroleum and Natural Gas have confirmed that 
the tax holiday would be available on production of crude oil but have continued to exclude gas.
Cairn India filed a writ petition to the Gujarat High Court in December 2008 challenging the restriction of section 80-IB to the 
production of oil. Gujarat High Court did not admit the writ petition on the ground that the matter needs to be first decided  
by lower tax authorities. An SLP has been filed before the Supreme Court against the decision of the Gujarat High court.  102 Cairn Energy PLC Annual Report 2010
NOTES TO THE ACCOUNTS 
(continued)
3 DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS AND ASSETS HELD-FOR-SALE (continued)
Indian tax holiday on gas production (continued)
In the event this challenge is unsuccessful, the potential liability for tax and related interest on tax holiday claimed on gas production 
for all periods to 31 December 2010 is approximately $53.5m. A demand was raised against one of the Group’s subsidiaries which 
included $11.2m of this amount and this has been provided for in the results for the year. Cairn does not expect demands to be 
raised on the remaining $42.3m prior to a Supreme Court ruling. 
Further, the tax office in India has disallowed the tax holiday claimed by Cairn India relating to condensate production for the fiscal 
year ending March 2007 on the basis that it is obtained from natural gas through condensation or extraction thus not included in  
the definition of mineral oil. The Company will appeal against this disallowance. The maximum tax exposure to the Group is $47 .4m 
including related interest. Similarly, the demand against on of the Group’s subsidiaries included $2.9m of this amount which has been 
provided in the accounts. The remaining $44.5m remains contingent.
4 SEGMENTAL ANALYSIS
Operating segments
For management purposes, the Group is organised into two business units; the Capricorn Group, being Capricorn Oil Limited and  
its subsidiary undertakings, and the Cairn India Group, each reporting internally to its own chief executive. There are two reportable 
operating segments as follows:
Cairn India Limited Group’s operations are primarily within India.
Capricorn Group’s operations focus on new exploration activities in Greenland and the Mediterranean. The Capricorn Group also 
includes the Group’s interests in Nepal and a share in certain North Indian assets operated by Cairn India Limited. This segment also 
included the results of the Group’s Sangu asset, operating in Bangladesh which was sold during the year. Operating segments based 
on the geographical locations of the Capricorn Group’s Greenland, Mediterranean and South Asia operating segments have been 
aggregated to form the Capricorn reportable segment. No one individual segment accounts for more than 10% of total segmental 
assets of the Group. As a whole, the Capricorn Group accounts for less than 1% of total Group external revenues.
Cairn Energy PLC is disclosed and exists to accumulate the activities and results of Cairn UK Holdings Limited, an intermediate 
holding company and direct parent of Cairn India Limited, and Cairn Energy PLC company results. Unallocated expenditure and net 
assets/(liabilities) including amounts of a corporate nature, not specifically attributable to one of the sub-Groups, are also included 
within this segment.
Management monitors the results of its business units separately for the purposes of making decisions about resource allocation  
and performance assessment. 
Following the announcement of the Vedanta transaction on 16 August, the results of the Cairn India Limited Group segment are 
classified as discontinuing and assets and liabilities classified as held-for-sale. Under IFRS certain presentational changes and 
adjustments are required to reflect that the assets and liabilities are classified as held-for-sale at the Balance Sheet date. 
Throughout the year, the Board monitored the performance of the Group by reference to the combined results of its separate 
operating segments, Cairn India and Capricorn, following accounting policies which did not reflect the classification of assets and 
liabilities of Cairn India as held-for-sale. The Board does not receive any allocation of assets or liabilities by segment. Segmental 
results are therefore disclosed on this basis. A summary of the adjustments made to reconcile the segmental results to those 
reported under the Group’s accounting policies are included within the segmental information provided. These adjustments include 
the reversal of the depletion, depreciation and amortisation charges for the period after the date the transaction was announced and 
a deferred tax position prepared on the basis that Cairn India was held-for-sale as at the Balance Sheet date. The combined impact 
of these adjustments is to increase profit after tax by $638m.
Segment accounting policies have been amended in 2010 to reflect the change in the Group’s accounting policy for the valuation  
of inventory as per Note 35a. Prior year comparatives have been adjusted to reflect this change in policy. 103

At the year end the Group reviews the carrying value of cash generating units within intangible exploration/appraisal assets for 
indicators of impairment or reversal of prior year impairment. The review at 31 December 2010 determined that indicators existed on 
a certain asset and, with no remaining producing assets to support the carrying value, this asset was impaired. Consequently $3.7m 
has been charged to the Income Statement. A further $7 .9m of impairment was charged in 2010 on certain intangible exploration/
appraisal assets prior to classification as assets held-for-sale.
At 31 December 2009, the review of intangible exploration/appraisal assets for indicators of impairment and subsequent impairment 
test resulted in a write down of $135.6m which has been classified as an exceptional charge against profit as it results from the assets 
transferred in the buy back of non-controlling interest in the year. See Note 6 for further details.
Goodwill relating to the acquisition of the Capricorn Group’s Mediterranean assets in prior years has been fully impaired following the 
unsuccessful drilling programme in 2010 and the decision to sell the Group’s remaining Tunisian asset. See Note 16 for further details.
Refer to details on the reasons for impairments in Notes 13 and 16 and Note 1(g) for details of the assumptions used in the 
impairment calculation.
c) Gain on sale of oil and gas assets
On 31 December 2009, Cairn entered into an agreement with Oil Search Limited for the sale of the Group’s 12.73% interest in  
Block PRL-1, Papua New Guinea. This transaction received Government approval during 2010 and a gain of $12.6m was recognised 
on the sale in the current year.

Administrative expenses – share-based payments
At an EGM held on 21 December 2009, Cairn’s shareholders approved the conversion of ‘phantom options’ awarded in 2007 and 2008 
based on notional ‘Units’ in the Group into Cairn Energy PLC Share options and LTIP’s. In accordance with IFRS 2, the incremental fair 
value of the modified awards, calculated at the date of modification, is charged over the remaining vesting period. A net charge of 
$35.6m is therefore recognised in the Income Statement as a result of this modification and in order to be comparable with 2009 this  
has also been included as an exceptional charge. A charge of $27 .8m was generated in 2009. Further details can be found in Note 27 .
Gain on disposal of non-controlling interest in Cairn India Limited and farm-out of exploration/appraisal assets
On 14 October 2009, Cairn entered into an agreement with Petronas to dispose of a further 2.29% of the Group’s holding in  
Cairn India Limited and farm-out a 10% interest in each of the six Cairn operated Greenland exploration licences. Total consideration 
receivable from Petronas was $310.0m of which $241.4m related to the Cairn India Limited shares with the remaining $68.6m allocated 
across the Greenland assets. At 31 December 2009 a balance of $63.5m was due to Cairn.
The disposal of the Cairn India Limited shares resulted in a gain of $199.5m and reduced the Company’s indirect percentage 
shareholding in Cairn India Limited to 62.39% at 31 December 2009. Capital gains tax on the sale of $17 .5m was charged to the 
Income Statement. Under the Group’s accounting policy proceeds on the disposal of intangible exploration/appraisal assets were 
initially credited against previously capitalised costs in the Balance Sheet. Surplus proceeds remaining were credited to the Income 
Statement recognising a gain of $15.0m.  107

Impairment of intangible exploration/appraisal assets
On 30 November 2009, Cairn announced the acquisition of the 9.99% non-controlling interest held by Dyas in Capricorn Oil Limited. 
Total consideration for the purchase of the Capricorn shares was $103.7m payable in $91.3m PLC shares, $3.7m cash and the transfer 
of 15% of Capricorn’s working interests in the Tunisian and Albanian licences. Prior to the transfer, an impairment test was performed 
based on fair value less cost to sell resulting in an impairment charge of $135.6m with an associated deferred tax credit of $33.6m.

The applicable tax rate was the weighted average rate for the year of the UK, Netherlands, Australian, Indian, Jersey, Swiss, 
Bangladeshi, Tunisian, Sri Lankan, Singaporean and Mauritian tax rates. There were no major changes in the statutory tax rates 
applying in each of these jurisdictions, however, the weighted average rate is subject to fluctuations from year to year based on the 
level of profits and losses which arise to the Group in each jurisdiction. The reason for the change of rate applied to assets classified 
as held-for-sale is disclosed in Note 3.
c) Factors that may affect future corporation tax charges
At 31 December 2010, Cairn had losses of approximately $237 .1m (2009: $527 .3m) available for offset against future trading profits 
chargeable to UK Corporation Tax. In addition there are surplus management expenses of $192.3m (2009: $141.4m) and non-trade 
deficits of $19.6m (2009: $21.9m) available for offset against future investment income. None of the trading losses, surplus management 
expenses or non-trade deficits has been recognised for deferred tax as it is not considered sufficiently probable that they will be used. 
Under UK tax law, tax losses may generally be carried forward indefinitely. 11 0 Cairn Energy PLC Annual Report 2010

Cairn India Group assets reclassified as held-for-sale (Note 3) of $376.5m in 2010 are those assets which are being held-for-sale 
pending completion of the Vedanta transaction. See Note 3 for further details. In addition $1.5m of costs net of impairment relating 
to the Nabeul licence were also included within assets held-for-sale. In 2009 assets held-for-sale included intangible exploration/
appraisal assets being transferred on the buy back of the non-controlling interest in Capricorn and costs relating to the Group’s 
Papua New Guinea interest. Prior to the re-classification, these assets were tested for impairment and an impairment charge of 
$135.6m recognised accordingly. Full details of the transfer of assets and resulting impairment loss can be found in Note 6.
In April 2010, Cairn completed an exploration well offshore Tunisia in the Louza block. Although minor evidence of light oil was 
observed, the expected target reservoir was not developed in the well. The well has therefore been plugged and abandoned  
without testing. As a result, all related costs are charged to the Income Statement as unsuccessful exploration costs. As $69.2m  
of these costs were previously impaired, the impairments have been released on relinquishment of the block. 
In Greenland the T8-1 well, which encountered gas in thin sands, has been plugged and abandoned. The T4-1 well, which was targeting 
a Tertiary objective at a different stratigraphic level to T8-1, failed to encounter any significant hydrocarbons and found only thin 
reservoir sands, although geochemical analyses continues on selective samples. As the T8-1 and T4-1 wells did not result in commercial 
discoveries the well costs, including all associated demobilisation and other costs, of $186.1m were charged to the Income Statement as 
unsuccessful exploration costs. The primary objectives of the third Greenland exploration well drilled on the Alpha prospect were not 
reached and the well has been suspended for future re-entry work depending on the results of further evaluation. Costs of the Alpha 
well, totalling $202.6m, remain in exploration/appraisal assets.
In December 2010 Cairn disposed of its interests in the Bangladesh licences to Santos. This triggered a release of previous 
impairments of $65.8m. 11 2 Cairn Energy PLC Annual Report 2010

13 INTANGIBLE EXPLORATION/APPRAISAL ASSETS (continued)
At the year end or prior to the intangible exploration/appraisal assets being transferred to assets held-for-sale, the Group reviews 
intangible/exploration assets for indicators of impairment. Where an indicator is identified, the asset is tested for impairment. As at 
31 December 2010, indicators were found on two assets held by the Capricorn Group where uncertain future drilling plans or other 
facts or circumstances existing indicated that the carrying value of the assets may not be recovered. As no development/producing 
assets remain in the cash generating unit of the Capricorn Group an impairment of $11.6m was identified and charged to the Income 
Statement in full. In 2009, exploration/appraisal costs of $1.9m relating to Bangladesh assets have been impaired. See Note 5(b) for 
further details of the impairment review. 
Disposals in 2009 relate to the farm-out of a 10% interest in each of Cairn’s operated Greenland licences to Petronas. A gain on 
disposal of $15.0m is recognised in the Income Statement. See Note 6 for further details. 
Exploration costs transferred to property, plant & equipment – development/producing assets (Note 14) during 2009 of $19.0m 
represent general exploration costs allocated to successful exploration activities in Rajasthan in accordance with the Group’s 
accounting policy.

Included within additions during the year is an amount of $28.5m of directly attributable borrowing costs (2009: $35.1m).
The net book value at 31 December 2010 included $135.3m in respect of assets under construction which are not yet subject to 
depletion; this has been transferred to assets held-for-sale. The 2009 net book value includes $584.2m of assets under construction 
not yet subject to depletion. 
Assets reclassified as held-for-sale (Note 3) of $2,402.2m in 2010 are the assets of Cairn India which are being held-for-sale pending 
completion of the Vedanta transaction. See Note 3 for further details. 
In December 2010 Cairn disposed of its interests in Sangu, the Capricorn Group’s sole development/producing asset, to Santos. 
At the year end, and prior to the Cairn India assets being transferred to assets held-for-sale, the Group reviews the carrying value of 
cash generating units within property, plant & equipment – development/producing assets for indicators of impairment or reversal  
of prior year impairment. This review determined that there was no impairment of assets. In 2009 the value of certain units within  
the Capricorn Group was below the carrying value resulting in an impairment charge of $1.3m. See Note 5(b) for further details of  
the impairment review.
Exploration costs transferred from intangible exploration/appraisal assets (Note 13) during 2009 of $19.0m represent general 
exploration costs allocated to successful exploration activities in Rajasthan in accordance with the Group’s accounting policy.

Goodwill was previously tested for impairment at the Balance Sheet date against the carrying value of the cash generating unit,  
being the combined Capricorn Group cash-generating unit equivalent to the reported operating segment. Following clarifications  
to IFRS effective during the current year, testing goodwill for impairment is now performed on the cash-generating unit equating to 
individual operating segments before they are combined into the reported segment. Goodwill has therefore been allocated to two 
cash generating units which are also operating segments combined within the Capricorn Group reported segment; the Greenland 
assets operating segment and the Mediterranean assets operating segment.
The recoverable amount of a cash-generating unit is determined by taking the higher of fair value less costs to sell or its value-in-use, 
using estimated cash flow projections over the licence period of the exploration assets risk-weighted for future exploration success. 
The key assumptions used in the value in use calculation are disclosed in Note 1(g). The key assumptions are sensitive to market 
fluctuations and the success of future exploration drilling programmes. The most likely factor which will result in a material change  
to the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit is the results of future exploration drilling, which will determine the licence 
area’s future economic potential. 
During 2010, $4.4m of goodwill relating to the Group’s Mediterranean assets has been fully impaired following the unsuccessful 
exploration drilling in 2010. No impairment was charged in 2009.
Additions to goodwill in 2009 arose on the acquisition by Cairn of the 9.99% non-controlling interest held by Dyas in Capricorn Oil 
Limited. The non-controlling interest was created in 2007 when Dyas acquired its holding in Capricorn with the group recording  
a gain on deemed disposal of $40.0m in that year. Total consideration for the purchase of the Capricorn shares was $102.5m. With  
the non-controlling interest at the date of the transaction being $41.0m, goodwill of $62.8m was recognised on the buy-back after 
deducting further costs resulting from the transaction. This goodwill is allocated to the Greenland assets cash generating unit for 
impairment testing and represents the balance of goodwill remaining at 31 December 2010. If future exploration drilling in Greenland 
proves unsuccessful, goodwill will be impaired in full. 11 6 Cairn Energy PLC Annual Report 2010

affect the Income Statement.
In determining the recoverability of a trade or other receivable, the Group carries out a risk analysis based on the type and age of the 
outstanding receivable. 
Included in the allowance for doubtful debts are individually impaired Joint Venture debtors with a balance of $83.7m (2009: $79.6m). 
These predominantly relate to outstanding Rajasthan cash calls which are currently being pursued by management. The increase 
in allowance recognised in the Income Statement for impaired Joint Venture debtors in 2010 is included in unsuccessful exploration costs.

As at 31 December 2010, the Group had a deferred tax asset of $11.9m (2009: $24.3m) in respect of future United Kingdom corporation 
tax deductions for equity-based remuneration. This asset has not been recognised as it is not considered probable that there will be 
sufficient profits to utilise these tax deductions. 
As at the Balance Sheet date, a deferred tax asset was not recognised in respect of Group losses of $449.0m (2009: $1,215.0m) 
(Company: $157 .6m; 2009: $141.4m) where it is not probable that they can be utilised in future periods.
No deferred tax asset has been recognised at 31 December 2010 or at 31 December 2009 in respect of trading or other losses,  
as it is not considered to be probable that these losses will be utilised against future trading or other profits arising to the Group. 
At the Balance Sheet date, the aggregate amount of temporary differences associated with undistributed earnings of subsidiaries for 
which deferred tax liabilities have not been recognised was $428.0m (2009: $398.5m). No liability has been recognised in respect of 
these differences because Cairn is in a position to control the timing of the reversal of the temporary differences and it is probable 
that, as a result of the proposed sale, these differences will reverse with no impact on future taxation. 121

Finance lease obligations have been reclassified as liabilities related to disposal units held-for-sale. 
In 2009 the average lease term was between 4 and 5 years. For the period ended 31 December 2009, the average effective borrowing 
rate was 19.33%. Interest rates are fixed at the contract date. All leases are on a fixed repayment basis and no arrangements have been 
entered into for contingent rental payments. The fair value of the Group’s lease obligations approximates their carrying amount. The 
Group’s obligations under finance leases are secured by the lessors’ rights over the leased assets. 
The Company does not have any obligations under finance leases.

Decommissioning costs which were expected to be incurred between 2016 and 2041 (31 December 2009: 2015 and 2041) have been 
transferred to liabilities related to disposal units held-for-sale. The provision has been estimated using existing technology at current 
prices and discounted using a real discount rate of 7% p.a. (2009: 7% p.a.). A re-assessment of the estimated costs of decommissioning 
the Rajasthan producing facilities undertaken during 2010 led to an increase in the decommissioning estimate of $147 .6m. 
Other provisions remaining at 31 December 2010 of $2.8m (2009: $2.3m) relate to a provision for onerous contracts relating to the 
Group’s Sangu asset which remains post disposal of the Group’s interests in the asset. Further provisions in 2009 represented $8.8m 
relating to phantom options awarded to certain employees in India, the remaining balance has been transferred to liabilities related 
to disposal units held-for-sale.
A provision of $95.6m regarding the Ravva arbitration proceedings was made during 2009. Payments withheld by the buyers of Ravva 
crude on the instruction of GoI have been offset against current profit petroleum payments due to GoI with the remaining excess 
offset against the provision. During 2010, the GoI issued further demand notices and withheld payments to recover 2009/2010 and 
2010/2011 current profit petroleum payments due. The provision has therefore increased to $58.8m prior to classification as liabilities 
related to disposal units held-for-sale.  123

Foreign currency translation
Group
Unrealised foreign exchange gains and losses arising on consolidation of subsidiary undertakings are taken directly to reserves in 
accordance with IAS 21 ‘The Effects of Changes in Foreign Exchange Rates’.
In accordance with IAS 21, foreign exchange differences arising on intra-group loans are not eliminated on consolidation; this reflects 
the exposure to currency fluctuations where the subsidiaries involved have differing functional currencies. These intra-group loans 
are not considered to be an investment in a foreign operation.

Unrealised foreign exchange gains and losses arise on translation of the Company’s £ functional results into $ presentation currency 
in accordance with IAS 21.

HMRC limits. The shares are normally held in trust for a period of 5 years after which they can be released to employees on a tax 
free basis.

Pre-2006 Plans and 2009 Plan (continued)
The Cairn Energy PLC share options have been valued using a binomial model. The main inputs to the model include the number  
of options, share price, leaver rate, trigger points, discount rate and volatility. 
Leaver rate assumptions are based on past history of employees leaving the Company prior to options vesting and are revised  
to equal the number of options that ultimately vest.
Trigger points are the profit points at which the relevant percentage of employees are assumed to exercise their options. 
The risk-free rate is based on the yield on a zero coupon Government bond with a term equal to the expected term on the option 
being valued.
Volatility was determined as the annualised standard deviation of the continuously compounded rates of return on the shares of  
a peer group of similar companies selected from the FTSE, as disclosed in the Directors’ Remuneration Report on pages 68 to 83, 
over a ten year period to the date of award.

2006 Plan and 2009 Replacement Share Option Plan
Under the 2006 Share Option Plan (the ‘2006 Plan’), employees had been granted ‘phantom options’ (which are equity settled)  
over ‘units’ in the Group. On the exercise of an option, participants would generally become entitled to such number of Cairn  
shares as have a market value equal to the notional gain that they realise, being the difference between the ‘notional exercise  
price’ attributable to their option and the price of the units in respect of which their option has been exercised. 
At an Extraordinary General Meeting on 21 December 2009 resolutions were approved to convert these phantom options into 
Replacement Options over ordinary shares in the Company – the Replacement Share Option Plan. The conversion was intended  
to put the director or employee in the same position as if, on the date the phantom option was granted, they had instead been 
granted an option on equivalent terms over shares in the Company. The conversion took place on 22 December 2009. 
The following table details the number and weighted WANEP of share options issued under the 2006 Plan as at 31 December 2009:

2006 LTIP and Replacement LTIP
Under the 2006 LTIP , certain executive directors and employees had been granted ‘phantom options’ (which are equity settled) over 
‘units’ in the Group. Following the vesting of an award, participants would generally become entitled to such number of Cairn shares  
as have a market value equal to the aggregate price of the vested units. Only 50% of these shares will be transferred to the participant 
immediately. The remaining 50% will be held for a further year.
At an Extraordinary General Meeting on 21 December 2009 resolutions were approved to convert these phantom options  
into Replacement LTIP awards over ordinary shares in the Company – the Replacement LTIP Plan. The conversion took place on 
22 December 2009. The conversion was intended to put the director or employee in the same position as if, on the date the phantom 
award was granted, they had instead been granted an award on equivalent terms over shares in the Company. An additional 
condition was made concerning the holding period; on vesting the holder is able to sell sufficient shares to fund the tax liabilities 
which have arisen, and the remaining shares will be held by the Company’s employment benefit trust until 9 January 2013.

28 FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT: OBJECTIVES AND POLICIES
Group and Company
The main risks arising from the Company’s and the Group’s financial instruments are liquidity risk, interest rate risk, foreign currency 
risk, and credit risk. The Board of Cairn Energy PLC reviews and agrees policies for managing each of these risks and these are 
summarised below.
The Group’s treasury functions at Cairn Energy PLC and local operational offices are responsible for these risks for their respective 
businesses, in accordance with the policy set by the Board. Management of these risks is carried out by monitoring of cash flows, 
investment and funding requirements using a variety of techniques. These potential exposures are managed whilst ensuring that  
the companies and the Group have adequate liquidity at all times in order to meet their immediate cash requirements.
There are no significant concentrations of risks unless otherwise stated.
The primary financial instruments comprise bank loans, cash, short and medium-term deposits, certificates of deposit, money market 
liquidity and mutual funds, intra-group loans, forward contracts, swaps, options, and other receivables and financial liabilities held at 
amortised cost. The Group’s strategy has been to finance its operations through a mixture of retained profits and bank borrowings. 
Other alternatives such as equity and other forms of non-investment-grade debt finance are reviewed by the Board, when 
appropriate, to fund substantial acquisitions or oil and gas projects.
Liquidity risk
On 28 March 2008 Cairn Energy PLC entered into a £30.0m revolving credit facility to fund its working capital. The facility was jointly 
provided by The Royal Bank of Scotland PLC and the Bank of Scotland and was to expire on 31 January 2013. Interest was charged  
at floating rates determined by LIBOR plus an applicable margin. The facility was cancelled on 20 January 2010. No sums were drawn 
at 31 December 2009.
On 15 September 2010 Cairn Energy PLC entered into a £200m revolving credit facility to fund its working capital. The facility was 
provided by Standard Chartered Bank Plc and was to expire on 30 September 2011. Interest was charged at floating rates determined 
by LIBOR plus an applicable margin.
On 15 December 2010 the above facility was refinanced. Cairn Energy PLC entered into a stand-by secured revolving credit of $900m 
to extend the working capital available, to enable commitments to be made for the 2011 Greenland drilling campaign and for other 
general corporate purposes. The facility is provided by Standard Chartered Bank, Bank of Scotland Plc, Crédit Agricole Corporate 
and Investment Bank, HSBC Bank PLC and Société Générale and expires on 30 September 2011. Security, in the form of a pledge 
over a number of shares in Cairn UK Holdings Limited, would be provided prior to first drawdown. Interest is charged at floating  
rates determined by LIBOR plus an applicable margin. No sums were drawn at 31 December 2010.
In addition, Cairn Energy PLC and the Capricorn Group have $35.0m of facilities (2009: $35.0m) in place to cover the issue of performance 
guarantees. Fixed rates of bank commission and charges apply to these. $0.7m was utilised as at 31 December 2010 (2009: $5.9m). 131

28 FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT: OBJECTIVES AND POLICIES (continued)
Liquidity risk (continued)
The Group currently has surplus cash which it has placed in a combination of money market liquidity funds, fixed term deposits  
and mutual funds with a number of International and Indian banks and financial institutions, ensuring sufficient liquidity to enable  
the Group to meet its short/medium-term expenditure requirements.
The Group is conscious of the current environment and constantly monitors counterparty risk. Policies are in place to limit 
counterparty exposure. The Group monitors counterparties using published ratings and other measures where appropriate.
Interest rate risk
Surplus funds are placed on short/medium-term deposits at floating rates. It is Cairn’s policy to deposit funds with banks or other 
financial institutions that offer the most competitive interest rate at time of issue. The requirement to achieve an acceptable yield  
is balanced against the need to minimise liquidity and counterparty risk.
Short/medium-term borrowing arrangements are available at floating rates. The treasury functions may from time to time opt to 
manage a proportion of the interest costs by using derivative financial instruments like interest rate swaps. At this time, however, 
there are no such instruments (2009: none).
Interest rate risk table
The following table demonstrates the sensitivity of the Group’s profit before tax to a change in interest rates (through the impact  
on floating rate borrowings and investments).
    Increase/(decrease) Increase/(decrease)  
    in basis points on profit before tax
2010 (continuing operations)    50 $2.5m
2009 (continuing operations)    50 $2.1m
The amounts calculated are based on actual drawings and investments in the periods for a 50 basis point movement in the total rate 
of interest on each loan or investment.
Foreign currency risk
Cairn manages exposures that arise from non-functional currency receipts and payments by matching receipts and payments in  
the same currency and actively managing the residual net position. Generally the exposure has been limited given that receipts  
and payments have mostly been in US dollars and the functional currency of most companies in the Group is US dollars.
The Group also aims, where possible, to hold surplus cash, debt and working capital balances in functional currency which in most 
cases is US dollars, thereby matching the reporting currency and functional currency of most companies in the Group. This minimises 
the impact of foreign exchange movements on the Group’s Balance Sheet.
Where residual net exposures do exist and they are considered significant, the Company and Group may from time to time opt to 
use derivative financial instruments to minimise its exposure to fluctuations in foreign exchange and interest rates.
The following table demonstrates the sensitivity to movements in the $:GBP and $:INR exchange rates, with all other variables held 
constant, on the Group’s monetary asses and liabilities. The Group’s exposure to foreign currency changes for all other currencies  
is not material.

28 FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT: OBJECTIVES AND POLICIES (continued)
Credit risk
Investment credit risk for investments with banks and other financial institutions is managed by the treasury function in accordance 
with the Board approved policies of Cairn Energy PLC. Investments of surplus funds are only made with approved counterparties  
who meet the appropriate rating and/or other criteria, and are only made within approved limits. The Board continually re-assesses 
the Group’s policy and updates as required. The limits are set to minimise the concentration of risks and therefore mitigate financial 
loss through counterparty failure.
PLC and Capricorn Group limit the placing of deposits, certificates of deposit and other investments to banks or financial institutions 
that have at least 2 AA- or above ratings from Moody’s, Standard & Poor’s or Fitch, unless a Sovereign Guarantee is available from a 
AAA rated government. The counterparty limit is $100m and a maximum of 5% of a fund. Investments in international money market 
liquidity funds are only made with AAA rated funds and where the investment policy is limited to money market instruments.
At the year end, the Group does not have any significant concentrations of bad debt risk other than that disclosed in Note 19. As at 
31 December 2010, the Group had investments with 10 counterparties to ensure no concentration of counterparty investment risk.
The maximum credit risk exposure relating to financial assets is represented by the carrying value as at the Balance Sheet date.
Capital management
The objective of the Group’s capital management structure is to ensure that there remains sufficient liquidity within the Group to 
carry out committed work programme requirements. The Group monitors the long term cash flow requirements of the business  
in order to assess the requirement for changes to the capital structure to meet that objective and to maintain flexibility.
The Board manages the capital structure and makes adjustments to it in light of changes to economic conditions. To maintain or 
adjust the capital structure, the Board may adjust the dividend payment to shareholders, return capital, issue new shares for cash, 
repay debt, put in place new debt facilities or other such restructuring activities as appropriate.
No significant changes were made in the objectives, policies or processes during the year ended 31 December 2010.

Fair value hierarchy
The Group uses the following hierarchy for determining and disclosing the fair value of financial instruments by valuation technique:
Level 1: quoted (unadjusted) prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities
Level 2: other techniques for which all inputs which have a significant effect on the recorded fair value are observable, either directly 
or indirectly
Level 3: techniques which use inputs which have a significant effect on the recorded fair value that are not based on observable 
market data.
At 31 December 2010 the Group had no financial instruments in level 1, 2 or 3. 
The Group has no financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss.

35 PRIOR YEAR ADJUSTMENTS
a) In June 2010, Cairn changed its accounting policy for the valuation of inventories of oil and condensate. Cairn now value such 
inventories at the lower of cost and net realisable value, where previously these inventories were valued at net realisable value based 
on the estimated selling price.
Cairn’s revised accounting policy aligns the Group with the majority of UK listed entities in the oil and gas sector. Given the increased 
volumes of inventory held in Rajasthan, Cairn believed that valuing oil and condensate at cost presented a fairer and more comparable 
measure of operating profit for a given period.
Prior period comparatives have been restated to reflect this change in policy. The following table indicates the changes that have 
been made to comparative statements. No detailed restated comparative information has been provided as there is no material 
impact on the results of earlier years following this change in policy, being only $0.8m impact on net assets and equity. 139

SHAREHOLDER NOTES
1. A member entitled to attend and vote at the Meeting is entitled to appoint one or more proxies to attend, speak and vote instead  
of him or her. A proxy need not be a member of the Company but must attend the Meeting to represent you. A form of proxy 
accompanies this Notice of Annual General Meeting and must be lodged with the Company at the office of its registrars, Equiniti 
Limited, Aspect House, Spencer Road, Lancing, West Sussex BN99 6ZR (the ‘Registrars’) or received via the Sharevote service (see 
Note 2 below) or lodged using the CREST proxy voting service (see Note 3 below) not less than 48 hours before the time appointed 
for the Meeting or any adjournment(s) thereof (excluding any part of any day that is not a working day). The appointment of a proxy 
will not preclude a member entitled to attend and vote at the Meeting from doing so if he or she wishes. You can only appoint a 
proxy using the procedures set out in these notes and the notes to the form of proxy. If you wish to change or revoke your proxy 
appointment, please contact the Registrars on 0871 384 2660 (if calling from overseas: +44 (0) 121 415 7047) for further details.  
Lines are open 8.30am to 5.30pm, Monday to Friday. Calls to the 0871 384 2660 number cost 8 pence per minute from a BT landline. 
Other telephony provider costs may vary. Calls to the helpline from outside the United Kingdom will be charged at applicable 
international rates.
2. Members may register their proxy appointments or voting directions electronically via the www.sharevote.co.uk website, where full 
details of the procedure are given. Members will need the Voting ID, Task ID and Shareholder Reference Number set out on the form 
of proxy which accompanies this Notice of Annual General Meeting. Members are advised to read the terms and conditions of use 
carefully. Electronic communication facilities are available to all shareholders and those who use them will not be disadvantaged.  
The Company will not accept any communication that is found to contain a computer virus.
3. CREST members who wish to appoint a proxy or proxies through the CREST electronic proxy appointment service may do so for 
the Annual General Meeting to be held on 19 May 2011 and any adjournment(s) thereof by using the procedures described in the 
CREST Manual. CREST personal members or other CREST sponsored members and those CREST members who have appointed 
a voting service provider(s) should refer to their CREST sponsor or voting service provider(s) who will be able to take the 
appropriate action on their behalf.
 In order for a proxy appointment or instruction made using the CREST service to be valid, the appropriate CREST message (a ‘CREST 
Proxy Instruction’) must be properly authenticated in accordance with Euroclear UK & Ireland Limited’s (‘EUI’) specifications and must 
contain the information required for such instructions, as described in the CREST Manual. The message, regardless of whether it 
constitutes the appointment of a proxy or an amendment to the instruction given to a previously appointed proxy, must, in order to 
be valid, be transmitted so as to be received by the Registrars (RA19) by no later than 12.00 noon on Tuesday, 17 May 2011, or, in the 
event that the Meeting is adjourned, not less than 48 hours before the time appointed for the adjourned Meeting (excluding any part 
of any day that is not a working day). No such message received through the CREST network after this time will be accepted. For this 
purpose, the time of receipt will be taken to be the time (as determined by the timestamp applied to the message by the CREST 
Applications Host) from which the Registrars are able to retrieve the message by enquiry to CREST in the manner prescribed by 
CREST. After this time, any change of instructions to proxies appointed through CREST should be communicated to the appointee 
through other means.
 CREST members and, where applicable, their CREST sponsors or voting service provider(s) should note that EUI does not make 
available special procedures in CREST for any particular messages. Normal system timings and limitations will therefore apply in 
relation to the input of CREST Proxy Instructions. It is the responsibility of the CREST member concerned to take (or, if the CREST 
member is a CREST personal member or sponsored member or has appointed a voting service provider(s), to procure that his 
CREST sponsor or voting service provider(s) take) such action as shall be necessary to ensure that a message is transmitted by 
means of the CREST system by any particular time. In this connection, CREST members and, where applicable, their CREST 
sponsors or voting service provider(s) are referred, in particular, to those sections of the CREST Manual concerning practical 
limitations of the CREST system and timings. The CREST Manual can be reviewed at www.euroclear.com/CREST.
 The Company may treat as invalid a CREST Proxy Instruction in the circumstances set out in regulation 35(5)(a) of the 
Uncertificated Securities Regulations 2001.
4. You may appoint more than one proxy provided that each proxy is appointed to exercise rights attached to different Ordinary 
Shares. You may not appoint more than one proxy to exercise rights attached to any one Ordinary Share. To appoint more than 
one proxy, please contact the Registrars on 0871 384 2660 (if calling from overseas: +44 (0) 121 415 7047 . Lines are open 8.30am  
to 5.30pm, Monday to Friday. Calls to the 0871 384 2660 number cost 8 pence per minute from a BT landline. Other telephony 
provider costs may vary. Calls to the helpline from outside the United Kingdom will be charged at applicable international rates.
5. The right to appoint a proxy does not apply to persons whose shares are held on their behalf by another person and who have 
been nominated to receive communications from the Company in accordance with section 146 of the Companies Act 2006 
(‘Nominated Persons’). Nominated Persons may have a right under an agreement with the registered shareholder who holds  
the shares on their behalf to be appointed (or to have someone else appointed) as a proxy. Alternatively, if Nominated Persons  
do not have such a right, or do not wish to exercise it, they may have a right under such an agreement to give instructions to the 
person holding the shares as to the exercise of voting rights. 
6. Any corporation which is a shareholder can appoint one or more corporate representative(s) who may exercise on its behalf  
all of its powers as a shareholder provided that they do not do so in relation to the same Ordinary Shares. 147

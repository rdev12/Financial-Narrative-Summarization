our consistent and robust performance during the 
financial year ended 30 June 2010 is particularly 
pleasing in light of the challenging economic 
environment and uncertainty affecting our sector.  
In line with our expectation, profit before tax from 
continuing operations before exceptional items 
and amortisation of intangible assets amounted 
to £12.0m (2009: £13.3m).  Adjusted earnings per 
share
1
 amounted to 29.91p compared to 33.65p for 
the previous year.  t he Board remains confident that 
it has the right strategy for continued success.  It is 
recommending a final dividend of 10.14p per share, 
resulting in dividends per share for the year as a whole 
totalling 14.34p compared to 13.66p for last year – an 
increase of 5%.  our business continues to be cash 
generative.  At the year end net cash stood at £31 .0m 
(2009: £32.1m) after reducing bank indebtedness by a 
further £5.6m.
t he strength of the business is underpinned by its 
strategy to:
•	 leverage our strong relationships with major 
uK and uS-based customers by servicing their 
international growth plans for commercial offices;
•	 further establish our uK and international 
presence in the retail fit out market of high street 
banks, food retail and global fashion brands;
•	 focus the business on the private sector which 
currently accounts for 70% of the Group’s 
revenue;
•	 continue a geographic expansion in the uK of our 
construction business to strengthen the service 
offering to our core clients.
A feature of the year has been our involvement 
in large-scale and prestigious projects.  A notable 
example is the olympic Velodrome stadium where 
we have performed to time and cost and attracted 
favourable reviews.  other noteworthy projects include 
the fitting out of a 400,000 sq. ft. office building 
for KpMG in canary Wharf and the completion of 
the hotel lobby and casino at the new Marina Bay 
Sands complex in Singapore.  of equal importance, 
in terms of revenues rather than project size, are 
our framework agreements with most of the uK 
supermarket groups and high street banks.
In our overseas markets our business comes 
predominantly from our multinational client base 
rather than national occupiers.  While some of these

clients have been cautious about the speed of their 
expansion in the current market, we are still winning 
significant new projects.  For example, in addition to 
Marina Bay Sands in Singapore, we are fitting out a 
70,000 sq. ft. office for Barclays in Geneva.
We have completed the integration of our recent 
acquisitions.  t hey have successfully assimilated 
our culture and values and have adopted our 
more rigorous systems and controls.  We have 
now consolidated our uK businesses into three 
distinct entities, namely Fit out, Food Retail and 
construction.  each has its own managing director 
and management board.  t his will provide greater 
focus to deliver the future growth of the business 
and also provide greater clarity for our customers.  
our overseas businesses, based in europe, Asia 
and the Middle east will largely face the market as 
before although we are taking a number of steps to 
strengthen their managements.
our vision is to be a leading international brand, 
delivering exceptional service.  We could not achieve 
this without the loyalty and hard work of our people, 
for which I thank them.  t heir commitment has seen 
the business continue to impress customers, win and 
deliver great projects, receive prestigious awards, 
while maintaining our exemplary health and safety 
record.
We can see signs of recovery in all our markets, 
except uK construction, but lead times are shorter.  
t hus whilst our order book at the year end at £742m 
is some £80m lower than last year, the amount due 
to be delivered in the current year is higher at £704m 
compared with £686m at this point last year.  Margins 
however will remain under pressure and therefore an 
improvement in profitability will be dependent upon 
the early signs of a pick up in economic activity being 
sustained into the second half of the financial year.
In the longer term we still view the future with 
confidence, based on our reputation with our major 
clients and the success of our strategy of diversifying 
the business by activity, sector and geography.  We 
will continue to explore opportunities to broaden 
further our business base.

I am pleased to announce a robust set of results, in line 
with management expectations and delivered against a 
challenging and competitive market.  our strategy to be 
a diversified business has created a balanced and flexible 
portfolio where we are not over exposed to any sector 
or geography.  In the past year, our uK businesses have 
performed strongly ahead of expectation and this has 
offset a delay in the expected pick up in international 
markets. 
Key features of our business during the year included:
•	 a private sector portfolio which accounted for circa 
70% of our revenue, helping to ensure we are not 
over exposed to future uK public sector spending 
cuts;
•	 continued strong allocations from our retail banking 
and food retail clients in the uK;
•	 a slower start to the year overseas as our 
international clients delayed commitments, but a 
stronger performance in revenue and profit in the 
second half of the financial year;
•	 closer customer relationships with multinationals, 
leading to more international opportunity;
•	 an increase in our office network both within and 
outside the uK.  underpinning this has been our 
strategy to grow in line with customer demand 
through both organic growth and acquisition;
•	 development of a high-end residential fit out activity 
in London to complement our commercial and retail 
fit out activities;
•	 we have further embedded our visions and values 
throughout the organisation.  It is this that keeps our 
brand strong and consistent as we continue to build 
our business across new geographies and sectors.  
our vision is to be a leading international brand 
delivering exceptional service in fit out, construction 
and management services; 
•	 we have continued to embed our systems and 
processes in our recent acquisitions and completed 
their integration into the Group.

Results
For the year ended 30 June 2010, adjusted profit before 
tax
1
 was £12.0m (2009: £13.3m) on revenue
2
 of £972m 
(2009: £1,046m).  Adjusted earnings per share
1
 amounted 
to 29.91p (2009: 33.65p).
t here were two exceptional items in the year.  t he first 
exceptional item of £1 .9m was recorded at 31 December 
2009 and represents the Group’s current estimate of 
fines and legal costs net of recoveries in respect of the 
office of Fair trading’s cover pricing investigation of 
two subsidiaries, propencity Group Limited and pearce 
construction (Midlands) Limited, prior to ISG’s ownership.  
t he propencity Group Limited’s fine of £0.1m has been 
settled.  We have lodged an appeal against the fine 
imposed on pearce construction (Midlands) Limited which 
has been heard.  We await the competition tribunal’s 
findings.
t he second exceptional item was the closure of our office 
in Japan, where we offered project management services 
only.  With no sign of recovery in the investment plans 
of our multinational clients in the Japanese market, we 
decided to discontinue our operations at a total loss for 
the year of £0.8m.
net cash as at 30 June 2010 of £31 .0m was slightly 
behind prior year (2009: £32.1m).  In the year there was 
net cash inflow from operating activities of £6.0m (2009: 
£6.9m) and the Group repaid £5.6m of bank borrowings.  
t he Group continues to trade well within its banking 
covenants.  In addition, the Group retains an undrawn 
working capital revolving credit facility of £10.0m which 
expires in 2013. 
Dividends
An interim dividend of 4.20p was paid in April 2010.  
t he Board has decided to recommend an increase for 
the final dividend of 5% to 10.14p, bringing the total to 
14.34p (2009: 13.66p).  Subject to shareholder approval 
at the AGM on 3 December 2010, the final dividend will 
be payable on 7 December 2010 to shareholders on the 
register on 5 november 2010.  t he ex-dividend date will be 
3 november 2010.  t he closing date for elections for the 
Dividend Reinvestment plan is 11 november 2010.

London Fit Out
After two years of decline, we predicted a stabilisation of 
the London fit out market.  t his has proved accurate, with 
revenue up by 4% to £170m (2009: £163m).  However it 
continued to be both a challenging and highly competitive 
market.  With operating margins decreasing to 1 .9% 
(2009: 2.6%), total operating profit decreased by 24% to 
£3.3m (2009: £4.3m).
notable successes over the year have included the fit 
out of KpMG’s new uK headquarters in canary Wharf, a 
15-storey office building totalling 400,000 sq. ft.  We also 
continue to develop our profile in the high-end residential 
sector with a number of prestigious wins in central 
London.  to support this growth in high-end residential, 
we recruited the former management team from Harry 
neal, a long-established London residential construction 
company.
t he current order book stands at £122m (2009: £159m) of 
which £118m is to be delivered in the current financial year 
(2009: £137m).  Significant contract awards for delivery 
in the current financial year include: Riverbank House for 
Man Group, t he Ark, Hammersmith, for Ge capital Real 
estate and 30 crown place, for pinsent Masons.  
currently we are seeing an upturn in the smaller-end 
fit out market and together with our focus on high-end 
residential, we anticipate revenue being ahead in the 
current financial year, although margins are likely to 
continue to be competitive.

London Construction
We expected that revenue would continue to decrease 
from the private sector London construction market.  t his 
is proving to be the case, with commercial developers 
only now starting to return to the market.  In line with this, 
we anticipate seeing an upturn in London construction 
activity levels but not until the second half of 2011 .  t his 
upturn will be partly fuelled by those 25-year leases from 
the 1980s and 15-year leases from the 1990s expiring, 
leading to a demand from new occupiers seeking modern, 
high-quality commercial space. 
During the year, we worked on some high-profile projects 
such as the olympic Velodrome, where our advice and 
methodologies have attracted positive media coverage 
for their delivery of cost and time benefits.  Additionally 
we worked on two large-scale student accommodation 
schemes – nido Spitalfields and nido notting Hill – for 
Blackstone and also a significant mixed-use scheme for 
Marshall Street Regeneration Limited.
Within London construction we have launched a new unit 
called London Building.  London Building is a dedicated 
business unit, established to focus on smaller spend 
projects within London and the South east. 
Despite a decline in revenue of 29% to £154m (2009: 
£217m), the operating margin on revenue increased to 
1 .4% (2009: 0.5%) resulting in operating profit increasing 
by 119%, to £2.2m (2009: £1 .0m).  t his reflects tight 
management of costs, together with better buying 
margins and a different mix of work.
In London, our construction portfolio is heavily weighted 
towards the private sector, so public sector cuts should 
have a negligible effect on our revenues.  However, project 
sizes have reduced, and we are therefore anticipating a 
10% decline in revenue in this financial year.  t he current 
order book stands at £114m (2009: £188m) of which 
£103m is to be delivered in the current financial year 
(2009: £140m).

Regional Construction
t he uK construction market outside London has 
declined as expected at a rate of around 10%.  Revenue 
in the period decreased by 8% to £338m (2009: 
£367m).  However, margins increased to 1 .0% (2009: 
0.8%) resulting in operating profit increasing by 17% 
to £3.5m (2009: £3.0m), mainly as a result of better 
buying margins.  t his is the Group’s one division with 
significant exposure to the public sector although we 
have been careful to ensure that our public sector 
portfolio is broadly spread across sectors, including 
work in education, defence, the Home office, health 
departments and social housing.  In addition, we 
continue to target the business towards smaller projects 
which we believe will be more resilient to the coming uK 
public sector cuts.
We continue to win work under a number of public 
sector frameworks including Ministry of Justice - 
custodial p roperty framework, Aspire Defence’s pFI 
framework, Manchester city council framework, 
Sovereign Housing Group framework, Swann Housing 
Group framework and during the year we were appointed 
to the construction Framework South West, as the Sole 
Framework contractor for Smaller p rojects for cardiff 
city council, and to Sheffield teaching Hospitals nHS 
Foundation t rust framework.
olympic Games related development has also featured 
in the regions, including Garon’s olympic Diving p ool in 
Southend and a national rowing facility in Durham.  While 
commercial activity remains slow, there are now some 
tentative signs of recovery in the residential sector.
During the year, we worked on 72 education projects 
(2009: 56) with a total revenue of £114m (2009: £118m) 
including completing the Suffolk one centre in Ipswich 
and St John’s School in Marlborough.  We have an 
education order book of £99m as at the end of June 2010 
(2009: £108m), which includes t he Manchester college, 
Millwood Special education needs School, north 
Warwickshire college Hinckley and newcastle university 
translational Research Building.
We have continued to spread our geographical reach 
across the uK in order to be positioned locally wherever 
there is market demand.  In line with this, we are 
strengthening our uK office network with a larger office 
in Birmingham and new offices in exeter and cardiff, 
both of which have already started to also support ISG 
pearce’s food retail expansion plans.  As at 30 June 2010, 
the total order book for Regional construction stands at 
£276m (2009: £286m).  of this, £253m will be delivered 
in the current financial year (2009: £223m).  Despite 
the in-year order book being ahead of prior year, we 
anticipate a tougher second half of the year and a decline 
in revenue for the year as a whole of 10%.

Retail
our uK retail operations continue to be provided by ISG 
pearce and ISG cathedral, with ISG p earce focusing on 
major food retail customers and larger format high street 
retailers and ISG cathedral working with the retail banking 
sector and smaller format high street retail customers.
Retail – ISG Cathedral
t he market for the financial services sector has continued 
to grow, in particular, our work under frameworks.  current 
clients include Barclays, Lloyds Banking Group, RBS and 
HSBc, the latter choosing ISG to deliver their p remier 
concept Branch in Kings Road, London.  t his increased 
activity from the banking sector has offset challenges 
presented by the high street retail sector.  However, there 
are encouraging signs that the high street retail sector is 
improving with recent wins from existing clients Monsoon 
and t he carphone Warehouse and, in addition, we have 
attracted new clients including Mulberry and oliver 
Sweeney.
ISG cathedral’s reputation for excellence in fit out services 
to the retail and leisure industry has been recognised 
at this year’s global RLI Awards.  t he company not 
only won Shopfitter of the Year, but its project for the 
Doyle collection’s London’s Kensington Hotel was also 
presented with the Award for Interior excellence.
t he order book for ISG cathedral at the end of the 
financial year is in line with the prior year at £50m (2009: 
£51m).
Retail – ISG Pearce
Although the capital spend of key clients on refurbishment 
programmes decreased during the year, ISG pearce was 
able to increase its market share with more turnover 
for new build and extension work, with increased work 
coming from major retailers including tesco, Asda, 
Sainsbury’s, Marks & Spencer and Morrisons where we 
are a key strategic partner on their frameworks.  During 
the year the business built its first new build supermarket 
for tesco, with three more currently under construction.  
During the last quarter we have continued to receive 
strong allocations with an order book at the end of the 
financial year of £113m (2009: £84m).
o verall, in uK retail, revenue decreased by 8% to £192m 
(2009: £208m).  t he operating margin increased to 3.5% 
(2009: 3.2%) resulting in operating profit being maintained 
at £6.7m (2009: £6.7m).  With the potential growth from 
high street retailers and a continued strong allocation from 
food and banking frameworks, we anticipate increased 
revenue in the current year.

Europe
In mainland europe our multinational clients held back 
from significantly investing in the first half of the year, 
recovering only in the last quarter of the year.  t his, 
despite a positive result in the second half of the year, 
has led to an overall operating loss of £0.2m (2009: 
operating profit £1 .4m).  We continued to grow the 
business with revenue increasing by 14% to £33m (2009: 
£29m).  Highlights have included project wins for clients 
such as Barclays, pfizer and Standard chartered Bank.  
In particular, our appointment to the exxon framework 
has led to projects for them in Belgium and Germany, 
with Rome and egypt scheduled for the year ahead.  on 
the back of customer demand, we continue to develop 
our network of offices in the region, with a new office 
in Geneva opened during the year and our acquisition 
of olson in Russia.  olson, rebranded ISG olson, is a 
specialist fit out company based in Moscow, with a 
strong track record of servicing multinational clients 
and it will further strengthen our european capability.  
our confidence in the future in mainland europe is 
demonstrated by a record order book at the year end of 
£32m in europe (2009: £6m).
Middle East
In the Middle east, where we offer fit out and joinery 
services, the joint venture business continued to 
make a small loss of £0.3m (2009: £0.4m) which was 
predominantly due to the poor performance of the joinery 
division.  However the fit out side of the business made 
a profit, delivering projects such as the Abu Dhabi football 
stadium, a cinema complex for cinestar and a commercial 
office for exxonMobil.  We have continued to invest in the 
build up of our capability in the region and are targeting 
to open a permanent office in Abu Dhabi in the current 
financial year.  
Since the year end, we have agreed terms to dispose 
of our interest in the joinery division to our joint venture 
partner, Al Habtoor Leighton, and to acquire a 100% 
interest in the fit out division.  t he order book for the fit 
out division at the end of the financial year is £9m (2009: 
£6m).

Asia
our Asia operations experienced significant margin 
pressure and a weighting in volumes to the second half of 
the year.  o verall the business continues to grow.  
Revenue from continuing operations increased by 44% 
to £86m (2009: £60m) but with operating margins 
decreasing to 2.2% (2009: 3.7%).  operating profit from 
continuing operations decreased by 16% to £1 .9m (2009: 
£2.2m).
Highlights in the year include our work for major clients 
such as Marina Bay Sands casinos, a 225,000 sq. ft. office 
for Standard chartered Bank (ScB) in Singapore and the 
project management of the Saudi Arabia pavilion at the 
Shanghai expo.  We were also appointed to the Goldman 
Sachs project management framework for china.  After 
the year end, we were appointed by ScB to provide 
project management services in Asia under a two-year 
contract.  Additionally, ISG’s design team hub in china was 
awarded a global two-year agreement to provide technical 
production design services for ScB internationally.
We have continued to progress in the retail sector, 
particularly in Hong Kong and china, working with clients 
such as Ralph Lauren, Apple, citibank, Bohai Bank, 
uGG and Giorgio Armani on their international roll out 
programmes.
t he year ahead is likely to be characterised by maintained 
volumes consolidating last year’s significant growth and 
a continued recovery in margins.  We expect our profit 
contribution within Asia to be more evenly spread than 
last year.  to support our future in the region we will be 
looking to continue to develop our people and we have 
appointed peter K Yam as a non-executive director of ISG 
Asia.  peter has extensive business experience in the 
region and was previously president of emerson Greater 
china - p eter’s focus will be to advise on our Greater 
china strategy and also to help us develop our leadership 
capability in the region.
Last year’s order book was heavily weighted to Singapore 
with the large Marina Bay Sands casino projects (£21m).  
t he order book at the end of the financial year of £26m 
(2009: £42m) is more evenly spread and focused on 
smaller projects.
We anticipate continued investment from our retail 
clients and we are now starting to see the recovery of 
the financial sector and an increase in commercial office 
activity.  For example, since the year end we have been 
appointed to project manage the 350,000 sq. ft. credit 
Suisse relocation to Kowloon.

Structure
As of 1 July 2010 we have reorganised to face the 
market with three distinct offers:
•	 For multinational corporate office and retail fit out 
customers the Group provides a broad range of 
services internationally;
•	 For national food retail customers the Group 
provides a comprehensive range of services in 
the uK extending from large and small fit out to 
refurbishment and new build;
•	 For uK construction customers the Group provides 
a full network of regionally based construction 
businesses operating on a nationally coordinated 
basis across england and Wales.
t his change to our structure, which includes the 
refocusing of our management teams on the three 
offers, will be reflected in the reporting of our numbers 
in future.  t he change is part of our ongoing development 
of the ISG brand, designed to make it easier for 
customers to engage with the right part of the business.  
It is reflected in our new corporate website, launched in 
June 2010. 
Outlook
At the end of June 2010 our total order book was £742m 
(2009: £822m), of which £704m (2009: £686m) is for 
delivery in the current year and £38m (2009: £122m) for 
the next financial year.
Across the Group, we will continue to focus on 
growing and developing our relationships with national 
and international customers.  t his, alongside our 
strengthened office network and further appointments 
to frameworks, will form the backbone of our strategy. 
t he London fit out market is likely to be stable over 
the coming year, with a greater number of smaller 
projects and an increase in activity in high-end residential 
refurbishment.  For London and Regional construction, 
with public sector cuts and waiting for the return of the 
private sector, the market is likely to decline overall in 
the second half of the financial year.
In uK retail, with continued strong investment by the 
banks and food retailers and the return of the high 
street, we expect volumes in the retail market to be 
moderately higher than the last financial year.
In europe, we expect to see continued progress 
in the next 12 months particularly in respect of the 
opportunities presented by the expansion plans of our 
multinational clients and we will also commence offering 
retail fit out.
In Asia, similarly with the return of finance sector clients 
to augment our strong activity with retail customers, we 
expect to see continued progress and benefit from the 
recovery of the Asian economy.
While there is little doubt that overall our markets will 
remain highly competitive over the coming year, we 
are seeing a recovery in the spending programmes of 
our private sector customers.  our results show the 
continued resilience of the Group and our strategy 
places us well to resume the growth path we 
demonstrated leading up to the global economic crisis.

ReVIeW
Revenue and Operating Profit
t he segmental analysis has been changed this year 
to reflect the separation of the management of the 
Group’s London operations between London Fit out 
and London construction.
Whilst the macroeconomic uncertainty has continued, 
ISG has delivered a set of robust results against 
challenging and competitive market conditions.  our 
uK businesses have performed strongly ahead of 
expectations and this has offset a delay in the expected 
pick up in international markets.
total revenue
2
 is down by 7% at £972m (2009: 
£1,046m). t his was due to decreases in revenue of 
29% in London construction to £154m (2009: £217m); 
8% in Regional construction to £338m (2009: £367m); 
and 8% in Retail to £192m (2009: £208m). t here 
have been increases in revenue of 43% in our Asia 
operations to £86m (2009: £60m), 14% in the revenue 
of our european operations to £33m (2009: £29m) and 
4% in London Fit out to £170m (2009: £163m).
Group adjusted operating profit
1
 declined by 11% to 
£12.5m (2009: £14.1m).  t here were decreases in 
operating profit of 24% in London Fit out to £3.3m 
(2009: £4.3m); 116% in europe to a loss of £0.2m 
(2009: profit £1 .4m); and 16% in our Asia operations 
to £1 .9m (2009: £2.2m) which have been partly offset  
by increases of 119% in London construction to 
£2.2m (2009: £1 .0m); and 17% increase in Regional 
construction to £3.5m (2009: £3.0m). t here was no 
change in Retail at £6.7m (2009: £6.7m).  t he costs 
from Group activities increased by 34% to £4.4m 
(2009: £3.3m) following further investment in central 
support functions. 
Exceptional Item
As reported last year, the activity of two of ISG’s 
subsidiaries, prior to ISG’s ownership, was included as 
part of the office of Fair trading (oFt) investigation into 
tendering in the construction industry. Both companies 
were fined. t he fine relating to propencity Group 
Limited of £0.1m was paid in november 2009. t he oFt 
fined pearce construction (Midlands) Limited £5.2m 
of which £4.4m is on a joint and several basis with the 
company’s former owner crest nicholson plc.  Both 
parties submitted appeals in november 2009 to the 
competition Appeal tribunal (cAt) and applied for the 
fines to be paid over a three year period. t he appeals 
were heard by the cAt in early July 2010, and we await 
its findings.

Jonathan Houlton 
Group Finance Director Legal fees of £0.5m have been incurred during the 
year.  A provision of £1 .2m in respect of potential fines 
and associated legal costs has also been made in the 
accounts, and treated as an exceptional item.
ISG has a £2.0m cash backed indemnity from the 
vendors of ISG pearce Holdings Limited, being cash of 
£1 .0m held in an escrow bank account and the remainder 
being the outstanding deferred consideration from the 
original acquisition.
Further details are provided in note 7 to the financial 
statements on page 76.
Discontinued operations
After reviewing future prospects in Japan in the context 
of the Group’s strategy for its Asian business, the 
decision was taken in April 2010 to discontinue its 
operations in that country. trading losses and closure 
costs incurred in the year were £0.8m (2009: £0.1m).
Key accounting policies
note 2 summarises the accounting standards that were 
adopted by the Group during the financial year. t he main 
change in accounting policy resulting from the revised 
standards is the requirement under IFRS 3 (revised) 
‘Business combinations’ to expense acquisition costs in 
the year they are incurred. Accordingly, £0.4m of such 
costs have been expensed this year (2009: £nil).
Profit before T ax
Adjusted profit before tax
1
 of £12.0m was 9% behind 
last year’s £13.3m.  Finance income decreased to 
£0.1m (2009: £0.9m) as a result of the lower interest 
rates throughout the year.  Finance costs decreased to 
£0.6m (2009: £1 .7m) as a result of the lower interest 
rates throughout the year and the continued repayment 
of debt. t he finance costs include the unwinding of 
discount on deferred consideration of £0.1m (2009: 
£0.4m). profit before tax was £8.0m (2009: £11 .7m) 
after losses on discontinued activity of £0.8m (2009: 
£0.1m), an exceptional loss of £1 .9m (2009: £nil), and 
amortisation of intangibles of £1 .4m (2009: £1 .4m).
T axation
t he Group’s effective tax rate was 26.9% (2009: 27 .3%).
t he rate was lower than the standard rate for the current 
year due to the utilisation of tax losses brought forward, 
offset by expenses disallowable for tax purposes 
including the provision relating to the oFt investigation 
and current year overseas losses carried forward for net 
off against future profits. tax losses brought forward of 
£4.0m have been utilised this year, and we have carried 
forward tax losses of £14.5m, none of which have been 
treated as a deferred tax asset.
Earnings per Share and Dividends 
Basic earnings per share for the period was 18.80p 
(2009: 29.67p).
t he adjusted basic earnings per share
1
 shows a decrease 
of 11% to 29.91p per share (2009: 33.65p). t he final 
dividend is proposed at 10.14p (2009: 9.66p) giving a 
total dividend for the year of 14.34p up 5.0% on last year 
(2009: 13.66p). At this level the dividend is covered 2.1 
times (2009: 2.4 times) based upon the adjusted basic 
earnings per share
1
.
Shareholders’ Funds  
During the year, shareholders’ funds increased by £5.2m 
to £50.5m (2009: £45.3m).
t he Group generated a profit after tax for the period 
of £5.8m (2009: £8.5m).  Dividend payments of £4.4m 
(2009: £3.8m) were made during the year. t he issue of 
shares in the year accounted for £2.5m of the increase in 
shareholders’ funds (2009: £2.4m). 
t he foreign currency reserve movement for the year was 
£0.4m (2009: £1 .2m) and represented the translation 
gain on the revaluation of the assets and liabilities of 
foreign subsidiaries and related goodwill using rates of 
exchange at the balance sheet date.
t he number of shares in issue at 30 June 2010 was 
33,158,467 (2009: 31,050,559).  t he increase of 
2,107 ,908 shares (2009: 1,592,860) is largely due to 
the issue of 2,107 ,038 shares as part of the deferred

In prior years the Group has entered into bank loan facilities 
totalling £29.7m to fund various acquisitions. At 30 June 
2010, a balance of £12.4m (2009: £18.4m) was outstanding 
on these facilities as a result of repayments in the year of 
£5.9m (2009: £5.9m). In addition, in May 2007 the Group 
entered into a £10.0m revolving credit facility for working 
capital purposes which was not drawn on during the year or 
at year end. t hese facilities expire in May 2013.
t he Group continues to have bonding facilities lines with 
euler Hermes, Hcc International, Liberty Mutual, norwich 
union, Royal Bank of Scotland, Société Générale and united 
o verseas Bank. 
Foreign exchange
t he exchange rates used to translate the Group’s overseas 
operations were as follows:
t he Group manages its foreign currency exposures by taking 
out forward exchange contracts as appropriate and monitors 
its currency risk on a regular basis. t he effect of volatile short-
term currency movements on profits is reduced because the 
Group accounts for foreign profits using average exchange 
rates. 
Goodwill
t he carrying value of goodwill is £79.9m. t he Group carries 
out annual impairment tests in relation to this amount. t hese 
tests use the cash flows derived from two year financial 
forecasts approved by the Board. Revenue growth and future 
gross margin are the key assumptions within these forecasts. 
t he testing undertaken shows that there is no impairment 
of these assets. Further details of the impairment tests 
performed are set out in note 16. 
Acquisitions and Deferred consideration
During the year, the Group paid deferred consideration on 
the acquisition in 2008 of ISG pearce Holdings Limited. t he 
Group paid cash of £1 .5m and issued shares with a value of 
£2.5m.  Further details are provided in note 7 to the financial 
statements on page 76.

REVIEw OF BuSInESS
A fair review of the Group’s activities during the year, trends and factors likely to affect the business and its future prospects 
are set out in the chief executive’s Statement on pages 2 to 36 the Financial Review on pages 38 to 41, the Directors’ Report 
on pages 44 to 49 and the corporate Governance report on pages 55 to 58, and the key performance indicators are set out in 
Group Financial Highlights on page 1, which are incorporated by reference to this report and should be deemed to form part of 
it. 
t he Directors’ Report is prepared for the members of the Group and should not be relied upon by any other party for any 
other purpose.  t he Directors’ Report (including the chairman’s Statement, chief executive’s Statement, the Financial Review 
and the corporate Governance report) contain certain forward-looking information and statements in relation to the Group’s 
operations, economic performance and financial conditions.  t hese statements are made by the directors in good faith based 
on the information available to them at the time of their approval of this report and, although they believe that the expectations 
reflected in such forward-looking statements are reasonable, they should be treated with caution due to the inherent 
uncertainties, including both economic and business risk factors, underlying such forward-looking statements or information.
BASIS FOR PREPARATIOn OF FInAnCIAL STATEMEnTS On A GOInG COnCERn BASIS
Information on the business environment in which the Group operates, including the factors that are likely to impact the future 
prospects of the Group, are included in the chief executive’s Statement on pages 2 to 36. t he principal risks and uncertainties 
that the Group faces are set out below on pages 45 and 46.  t he financial position of the Group, its cash flows, liquidity position 
and debt facilities are described in the Financial Review on pages 40 and 41 .  In addition, notes 3 and 26 to the consolidated 
financial statements set out the Group’s objectives, policies and processes for managing its capital, financial risks, financial 
instruments and hedging activities, and its exposure to credit risk and liquidity risk.
t he directors have prepared cash flow forecasts for the Group for a period in excess of twelve months from the date of 
approval of these consolidated financial statements.  t hese forecasts are based on the Group’s existing order book and reflect 
an assessment of current and future market conditions, their impact on the Group’s trading performance and the actions taken 
by management in response to current market conditions.  t he forecasts completed on this basis demonstrate that the Group 
will be able to operate within the current committed debt facilities and show continued compliance with the financial covenants.  
In addition, management has considered various mitigating actions that could be taken in the event that future market 
conditions deteriorate beyond their current assessment. Such measures include further improvements in working capital within 
management’s control, further reductions in costs and capital expenditure and use of the Group’s undrawn credit facilities.
on the basis of the exercise described above, the directors have a reasonable expectation that the Group and company have 
adequate resources to continue operating for the foreseeable future.  Accordingly, they continue to adopt the going concern 
basis in preparing the financial statements of the Group and the company.

At the Annual General Meeting held on 4 December 2009, the shareholders authorised the company to make one or more 
market purchases of ordinary shares of 1p each in the capital of the company during the year.  t he company did not exercise

share schemes.  At the year end the trust held a total of 1,569,129 (2009: 1,614,487) ordinary shares of 1p each in the capital 
of the company, representing 4.73% (2009: 5.20%) of the company’s called-up ordinary share capital.  t he trust has, at the 
recommendation of the Board, waived its right to receive dividends.
PRInCIPAL RISKS AnD unCERTAInTIES
t he key risks and uncertainties facing the Group are considered as part of the Group’s well established process for identifying, 
evaluating, and managing risk. t he impact of significant risks and their mitigation is monitored at both Group and subsidiary 
Board meetings throughout the year and are subject to annual review by the Board. t he Board considers that the most 
significant risks are:
•	 Market and economic environment 
 
t he varied market sectors in which the Group operates are affected by general macroeconomic conditions and changes in 
Government spending priorities.  t he state of the market and the economy may adversely impact the Group’s order book 
and lead to increased competition and over-reliance on key clients. t he Group is continually reviewing economic prospects 
for each of its activities including order book levels and market data and is positioning its activities to maximise shareholder 
value. Resource levels are regularly reviewed against anticipated workload and discretionary expenditure continues to be 
45 RepoR t  
AnD FInAncIAL 
St AteMentS 2010
monitored closely. our ongoing strategy of diversification across a broad geographical and sector spread helps to mitigate 
risks associated with the current macro-economic conditions.
•	 Attracting, developing and retaining staff 
 
Attracting, developing and retaining high calibre senior management and other key staff are crucial to the Group achieving 
its aims. Failure to do so could adversely affect Group performance in terms of project delivery and growth. t here is a 
remuneration system in place that is firmly linked to performance as well as a continuous formal performance appraisal 
system to provide regular assessment of individual performance. Staff are actively encouraged to develop their skills, taking 
advantage of the training schemes embedded throughout the Group. t he Group also has succession planning processes in 
place to identify and develop staff to fill key roles.
•	 Financial risk 
 
As detailed in note 26, the Board considers the Group’s key elements of financial risk to be interest rate risk, currency rate 
risk, credit risk and liquidity risk.  t he Group is exposed to interest rate risk primarily through borrowing funds at floating 
interest rates albeit the Group’s positive cash balance normally acts as a natural hedge. t he Group continually monitors 
interest rate movements and the use of interest rate swaps is considered regularly. t he Group publishes its financial 
statements in pounds Sterling and conducts most of its business in Sterling.  t he level of foreign business is approximately 
12% of the Group’s turnover. Relevant foreign currency rates are continually monitored. t he credit and liquidity risks are 
diminished by the creditworthiness of the Group’s customers and the strength of its cash position.  In addition the Group 
is reliant on its supply chain in particular the financial stability of each sub-contractor which is monitored on a regular basis. 
t he Group treasury function operates within policies and processes approved by the Board. It ensures that there are 
sufficient levels of committed facilities and cash and cash equivalents to enable the Group to meet its liabilities as they fall 
due and operate within its financial covenants at all times. As the Group generally has a positive net cash position, it reviews 
its treasury position daily, placing surplus cash on short-term deposits. t he company does not speculate with derivative 
instruments.
•	 Project risk 
 
t he risks to which the Group is exposed are dependent upon the nature and complexity of the work, the duration of the 
contract and the legal form of the contract. Failure to manage or deliver a project in accordance with the contract to an 
appropriate quality and on a timely basis could result in a number of issues, including cost overruns, delays and contractual 
disputes, which could adversely impact on the profitability and reputation of the Group. t he Group has a controlled approach 
to contract selection to ensure that work undertaken matches the capability and resources available, that contractual terms 
are acceptable, and that clear responsibility for scrutiny and approval is given to the appropriate level of management. 
In addition, contracts in progress are controlled and managed through the Group’s operating structure and procedures, 
including detailed and regular reviews both divisionally and centrally of forecast revenue and costs to complete.
•	 Health, safety and environmental risks 
 
t he Group treats health, safety and environmental issues as a priority. Failure to manage these risks could result in serious 
harm to employees, subcontractors, the public or the environment and could expose the Group to significant potential 
liabilities and reputational damage. t he Group has a comprehensive policy and framework in place to manage these risks 
and best practice is shared via the Health & Safety forum.  t he accident incidence rate is monitored closely in all operating 
companies.
•	 Counterparty risk 
 
t he Group is exposed to the counterparty risk of its clients, subcontractors, suppliers and financial institutions. t he failure 
of any counterparties could lead to significant financial loss. t he Group performs a credit risk assessment on clients before 
a contract is signed. Where possible, credit insurance is taken out on the Group’s clients or suitable arrangements, such as 
the use of escrow accounts or reduced credit terms, are put in place. Subcontractors’ performance and financial stability 
is continually monitored once they have been approved and are working with the Group. contracts are spread between 
subcontractors to the extent possible to reduce dependence on any one subcontractor. t he Group monitors the level of 
funds held with each financial institution and mitigates the risk by limiting the level of funds held.
Directors’ report  (continued) PAyMEnTS TO CREDITORS
t he Group’s policy is to fix payment terms when agreeing the terms of each transaction.  It is the Group’s general policy to 
pay suppliers according to the agreed terms and conditions, provided that the supplier has complied with those terms.  trade 
creditors include retention amounts held over defect liability periods.  t he creditor days for the Group at 30 June 2010 are 48 
days (2009: 48 days).
DOnATIOnS
During the year the company made no political donations (2009: £nil).  During the year the Group made charitable donations 
totalling £23,369 (2009: £18,833) including £4,140 to Muscular Dystrophy, £4,000 to caravan, £2,000 to the national Autistic 
Society and £2,401 to various hospice trusts.
EMPLOyMEnT POLICIES
We support the principle of equal opportunities in employment and oppose all forms of unlawful or unfair discrimination on the 
grounds of colour, race, religion or belief, age, nationality, ethnic origin, gender, sexual orientation, marital status or disability.  
t he Group’s policy provides equality of opportunity for employment and advancement on the basis of an individual’s suitability 
for the work.  As an equal opportunities employer our benefits and training are accessible to every staff member and, as 
mentioned above, we encourage and support personal and professional development.  
At ISG we pride ourselves not only on the projects that we deliver but also the training opportunities we provide to our staff.  
All of our uK businesses are accredited by Investors in p eople.  t he accreditations are supported by regular audits.  In the last 
year we have reviewed our performance Development Review process across the businesses in the uK to share best practice 
and consequently we have streamlined the process.  t he Group’s values and associated behaviours are a fundamental part of 
the review process.  t hese reviews ensure that employees continue to receive structured feedback and have the opportunity to 
agree personal development plans with their managers.
Building on the experience gained from working with the olympic Delivery Authority we are enhancing our equality and 
Inclusion programme across the Group.
t he Group has well-established mechanisms to communicate with employees at every level and to encourage their involvement 
regarding the Group’s performance and future activities.  Following the re-launch of the Group’s external website in June 2010, 
work is now underway to update and improve the intranet for all employees across the Group.  Information for employees is 
given through a combination of online communications and flyers, brochures and newsletters which seek to achieve a common 
awareness on the part of all employees of the financial and economic factors affecting the Group’s performance.
All employees who have completed six months service with a Group company are invited to join the company’s Savings Related 
Share option Scheme on an annual basis and thereby share in the success of the Group.
During the year we recruited a HR director who has responsibility for the development of the Group human resources strategy 
in the uK and europe.  t his is a new position intended to drive excellence across the human resources agenda to support the 
Group’s overall business objectives.
HEALTH & SAFETy 
t he Board continues to consider health & safety a key priority and has maintained this focus throughout the year.  It is essential 
that we take all reasonable measures to conduct our business to ensure the health, safety and welfare of all our employees 
and all other persons who may be affected by our activities.  t his includes members of the public, clients, designers and the 
trade contractors that we employ.  In the uK we support this with our certifications to oHSAS 18001:2007 occupational Health 
& Safety Management Systems and our dedicated teams of health & safety professionals achieving industry leading safety 
performance.  t his is demonstrated by ISG’s Accident Incident Rate (calculated on the number of reportable accidents per 1,000 
employees) of 3.17 (2009 - 3.12) (industry average 7 .81 for the period April 2009 to March 2010).  t hese figures now also include 
our safety performance in Asia.  We endeavour to ensure that the same high standards of health & safety are applied by our 
overseas operations.
one of the best ways to raise standards is to recognise and reward those that lead the field and to encourage others to follow.

St AteMentS 2010
t hat is why every year t he Royal Society for the prevention of Accidents (RoSpA) and the British Safety council (BSc), two of 
the world’s leading health & safety organisations, invite companies of all sizes from the full spectrum of work activities and from 
all over the world to enter the RoSpA and BSc safety awards.  During May 2010 the Group received nine RoSp A Gold Medals, 
21 Gold Awards and two Silver Awards (2009: twelve RoSpA Gold Medals, six Gold Awards and one Silver Award) and 20 BSc 
International safety awards (2009: 15 BSc International safety awards).
We have maintained a strong commitment to health & safety training with over 75 uK directors and senior managers 
completing the IoSH (Institute of occupational Safety and Health) Safety for senior executives course.  We also now have over 
280 uK employees and key suppliers who have completed our 5 day Site Managers Safety training Scheme.
SuSTAInABILIT y
ISG is committed to the sustainability of our business, our communities and our environment.
construction services are our core business and as such our influence is far reaching.  We oversee the changing of landscapes, 
performing work throughout communities across the world for clients within varying industry sectors.  t hrough our supply chain 
we acquire and dispose of vast quantities of materials on a daily basis.  As an employer we are responsible for the wellbeing 
and development of a large workforce and we are responsible to our shareholders for financial performance.  In short our work 
affects people, the planet and the prosperity of many on a daily basis and this, more than anything, has formed the basis of our 
sustainability policy and strategy.
true sustainability requires a holistic approach which embraces all aspects equally. our sustainability strategy has been 
developed to cover all three pillars: ‘people’ (social issues), ‘planet’ (environmental issues) and ‘prosperity’ (economic issues).
•	 People (social issues) 
 
our main objectives are to develop the skills of our staff; to be socially responsible treating all of our stakeholders fairly and 
with respect; create a safe and healthy built environment and to manage our supply chain responsibly. 
 
In the last year we maintained our commitment to health and safety issues and have won further recognition including a 
wide range of RoSpA and British Safety council awards as detailed above. our training academies continue to improve 
the skills of our staff and we continue to recognise our supply chain development with the continuation of our annual ISG 
sustainability award.
•	 Planet (environmental issues) 
 
We aim to enhance and protect the natural environment and minimise the consumption of natural resources and non-
renewable energy sources. We also aim to minimise waste and maximise the opportunities for recycling. to demonstrate 
this commitment, all of our uK-based operations and now our Hong Kong office have management systems which are 
certified to the requirements of ISo14001:2000 environmental Management Systems. 
 
Waste management remains a priority with commitments to the uK halving Waste to Landfill initiative promoted by the 
government funded WRAp (Waste & Resources Action programme). our recycling rates continue to improve across the 
business with our exemplar projects achieving recycling rates of up to 99% and with a uK recycling rate of 85% (2009: 
81%). 
 
We are also leading the industry in sustainable materials with key projects achieving a recycled content of 33% and 
responsible sourcing rates of 85%.
•	 Prosperity (economic issues) 
 
our main objective is to be a good corporate citizen and engage with the local communities in which we work. We also 
aim to improve the capability of ISG and to communicate with our shareholders. 
 
our projects continue to participate with the voluntary considerate constructors schemes and our impressive run of 
national awards continued with 15 in 2010. t his year also saw the palestra project in Southwark winning Runner up for the 
prestigious ‘Most considerate Site 2010’ for its work in the local community. 
 
We have improved the Group’s capability by investing in innovation and development to ensure that we remain efficient, 
effective and competitive.

REMunERATIOn COMMITTEE
t he members of the Remuneration committee during the year were J L Jeremy (chairman), M J Barnes and J R Stevenson.  
t he Remuneration committee makes recommendations to the Board, within existing terms of reference, on remuneration 
policy and determines, on behalf of the Board, specific remuneration packages for each of the executive directors.
REMunERATIOn POLIC y
t he Group’s policy is to provide executive remuneration arrangements which are designed to attract, motivate and retain 
directors of the high calibre required and to reward them for enhancing value to shareholders without encouraging inappropriate 
risk taking.  t he performance measurement of the executive directors and the determination of their annual remuneration 
arrangements are undertaken by the Remuneration committee consisting solely of non-executive directors.  t he remuneration 
of the non-executive directors is determined by the full Board.
In framing remuneration policy the Remuneration committee has given full consideration to the requirements of the combined 
code appended to the Listing Rules of the London Stock exchange. 
COMPOnEnTS OF REMunERATIOn
t he Remuneration committee recognises the importance of ensuring an appropriate mix of performance related and 
non-performance related elements of remuneration and this is reflected in the remuneration arrangements established 
for the executive directors.  t he Remuneration committee reviews the remuneration of the executive directors and the 
senior management to ensure a consistent approach is being applied to remuneration arrangements.  t he components of 
remuneration are:
a) basic salary and benefits; 
b) performance related discretionary bonuses; and 
c) performance related share option incentives.
t he company operates an optional salary waiver arrangement which can result in pension contributions being made.
BASIC SALARy
An executive director’s basic salary is determined by the Remuneration committee at the beginning of each financial year and 
when an individual changes position or responsibility.  J c B Houlton and S D Lawther did not take a salary increase during the 
year.
BOnuS PA yMEnTS
In the year ended 30 June 2010, the directors received bonuses which reflected performance relating to the financial year 
ended 30 June 2009.  
For J c B Houlton and S D Lawther the performance criteria for the financial year ended 30 June 2009 included Group profit 
based targets, completion of strategic objectives and non-financial elements covering health & safety, financial accounting 
standards, human resource management and environmental responsibility.  As stated in last year’s annual report, not all of the 
targets were achieved and therefore J c B Houlton and S D Lawther did not receive the maximum bonuses of 75% of basic 
salary.  However, it was the view of the Remuneration committee that J c B Houlton and S D Lawther had performed well 
against the targets despite the difficult economic circumstances and they therefore each received a bonus equal to 50% of 
basic salary.  Similar performance criteria applied for the financial year ended 30 June 2010, the maximum bonus payable being 
up to 75% of basic salary.  Again, not all of the targets were achieved and therefore an accrual of 60% of basic salary has been 
included in the accounts for the financial year ended 30 June 2010.
For G V Aldridge the performance criteria for the financial year ended 30 June 2009 included Group profit based targets and 
completion of strategic objectives.  t he maximum bonus payable was 50% of basic salary.  As not all of the targets were 
achieved he received a bonus equal to 20% of basic salary.  Similar performance criteria applied for the financial year ended 
30 June 2010, the maximum bonus payable being up to 50% of basic salary.  Again, not all of the targets were achieved and 
therefore an accrual of 20% of basic salary has been included in the accounts for the financial year ended 30 June 2010.
Report of the Board to the shareholders on directors’ remuneration SHARE OPTIOnS
t he Remuneration committee approves the grant of options to executive directors under the Group’s discretionary share option 
schemes.  In respect of share options, the following audited information also applies:
a) details of directors’ share options are detailed below, and  
b) all options granted to directors under the Approved plan (since 2008) and under the unapproved plan are subject  
 to performance criteria relating to growth in adjusted earnings per share which is calculated from the earnings   
 attributable to ordinary shareholders after adjusting for amortisation of goodwill and the profit or loss on disposal of  
 associates and subsidiaries.
t he performance criteria for share options unexercised as at 30 June 2010 are as follows:
Date of grant Performance period T arget  
10 May 2004 1 July 2004 to 30 June 2007 t he percentage increase in adjusted epS over the performance  
  period must be greater than the increase in the RpI plus 3% per  
  annum over the same period.
29 September 2005 1 July 2005 to 30 June 2008 t he percentage increase in adjusted epS over the performance  
  period must be greater than the increase in the RpI plus 3% per  
  annum over the same period.
18 September 2006 1 July 2006 to 30 June 2009 t he percentage increase in adjusted epS over the performance  
  period must be greater than the increase in the RpI plus 3% per  
  annum over the same period.
14 october 2008 1 July 2008 to 30 June 2011 t he percentage increase in adjusted epS over the performance  
  period must be greater than the increase in the RpI plus 3% per  
  annum over the same period.
14 April 2009 1 July 2009 to 30 June 2012 Aggregate adjusted epS for the performance period must be  
  in the range of 72p to 80p.  t he proportion of the option which is 
  exercisable will increase from 0% to 100% on a straight line  
  basis between these amounts.
16 october 2009 1 July 2009 to 30 June 2012 Aggregate adjusted epS for the performance period must be  
  in the range of 72p to 80p.  t he proportion of the option which is 
  exercisable will increase from 0% to 100% on a straight line  
  basis between these amounts.
In the Remuneration committee’s opinion any share-based incentives should be linked to the interests of the shareholders and 
the principal measure of those interests is shareholder return.  t he Remuneration committee believes that an improvement in 
earnings per share should be reflected in future enhanced shareholder return.
executive directors are also entitled to participate in the SAYe Scheme.

DIRECTORS’ COnTRACTS
none of the service contracts of executive directors includes provision for specific payment in the event of early termination, 
nor do they provide for extended notice periods in the event of a change in control.  It is not the Remuneration committee’s 
intention to introduce such provisions.  If any existing contract of employment is breached by the company in the event of 
termination, the company would be liable to pay, as damages, an amount approximating to the net loss of salary and contractual 
benefits for the unexpired notice period.  t he Remuneration committee will seek to ensure that the director fulfils his obligation 
to mitigate his losses and will also give consideration to phased payments where appropriate.
Details of the service contracts of the executive directors are shown in the table below.

Report of the Board to the shareholders on directors’ remuneration  (continued) While the Group is not subject to the provisions of the revised combined code on corporate Governance – June 2008 (t he 
combined code), the directors have decided to provide corporate governance disclosures.  t he directors have also considered 
the guidance set out in Guidance on Audit committees (formerly known as t he Smith Guidance).
Section 1 of the combined code, as appended to the Listing Rules, sets out p rinciples of Good corporate Governance and 
code provisions which are applicable to listed companies incorporated in Great Britain.
A narrative statement on how the company has applied the principles and a statement explaining the extent to which the 
provisions in the code have been complied with appear below.
nARRATIVE STATEMEnT
Section 1 of the code establishes 14 p rinciples of Good Governance which are split into the four areas described below.
Directors
t he company is controlled through the Board of directors which comprises three executive directors and four independent 
non-executive directors.  t here is a separation of the roles and responsibilities of the chairman and the chief executive.  t he 
non-executive chairman leads the Board and ensures that the directors have sufficient relevant information to enable them to 
make informed decisions on the strategy of the business and to assess the performance of the various business units.  t he 
chief executive’s responsibilities focus on running the Group’s businesses and implementing Group strategy.  All directors are 
able to take independent professional advice in furtherance of their duties if necessary.
t he Board has considered and confirmed the independence of its non-executive directors.  Although J L Jeremy has been a 
director of the company since 1995, the Board believes that he continues to be independent in character and judgement; he has 
extensive experience as a non-executive director in sectors other than construction and, furthermore, during his directorship 
the management team of the company has changed and, therefore, he is not considered to be too closely connected with the 
incumbent executive directors.
During the year there were ten Board meetings, three Audit committee meetings and five Remuneration committee meetings.  
Attendance by the directors was as follows:
 Board Audit Committee Remuneration Committee
G V Aldridge 10 n/A n/A
M J Barnes 9 n/A 3
R M Dantzic 10 3 n/A
J c B Houlton 9 n/A n/A
J L Jeremy 9 3 5
S D Lawther 10 n/A n/A
J R Stevenson 10 3 5
t he chairman also regularly meets with the non-executive directors without the executive directors present to discuss the 
performance of the Group and any other matters as they arise.
t he Board has a formal schedule of matters reserved to it which includes:
•	 approval of annual budgets and business plans
•	 approval of contracts exceeding prescribed thresholds
•	 acquisitions and disposals
•	 approval of all capital expenditure projects not covered by budget
It is responsible for overall Group strategy, acquisition and divestment policy, approval of major capital expenditure projects and 
consideration of significant financing matters.  It monitors the exposure to key business risks and reviews the strategic direction 
of individual trading subsidiaries, their codes of conduct, their annual budgets, their progress towards achievement of those 
budgets and their capital expenditure programmes.  t he Board also considers environmental and employee issues and key 
appointments.  It ensures that all directors receive appropriate training on appointment and then subsequently as appropriate.  
All directors, in accordance with the code, will submit themselves for re-election at least once every three years.

St AteMentS 2010
t he Board has two committees, the Audit committee and the Remuneration committee.  Details of the Remuneration 
committee can be found in the Report of the Board to the Shareholders on Directors’ Remuneration on pages 50 to 54.  t he 
members of the Audit committee are R M Dantzic (chairman), J L Jeremy and J R Stevenson.  R M Dantzic is a qualified 
accountant, he has been a finance director of two public companies and he is considered to be the non-executive member of 
the Board with the most recent experience necessary for the role of chairman of the Audit committee. 
During the year, the Audit committee of the Board:
a) meets regularly with the external auditors and executive directors attending by invitation to review the financial 
statements, the suitability of the accounting policies and financial reporting of the company, its internal management and 
financial controls and matters arising from the external auditors’ work;
b) approves the nature and extent of non-audit work undertaken by the external auditors; and
c) makes recommendations to the Board on these matters. 
In forming their opinion of the independence and objectivity of the external auditors, the Audit committee takes into account 
the safeguards operating within the external auditors and ensures that the level of audit fee is sufficient to enable them to 
fulfil their obligations in accordance with the audit Letter of engagement.  Fees for non-audit work are reviewed by the Group 
Finance Director and then passed to the Audit committee for approval.
t he chairman of the Audit committee makes a report to the Board following each committee meeting and the Board receives 
the minutes of all Audit committee meetings.
t he Audit committee’s terms of reference are available from the Secretary and will be available for inspection at the Annual 
General Meeting.
Directors’ remuneration
t he Remuneration committee measures the performance of the executive directors and key members of senior management 
as a prelude to recommending their annual remuneration, bonus awards and awards of share options to the Board for final 
determination.  t he report of the Board to the shareholders on directors’ remuneration is set out on pages 50 to 54.  t he 
Remuneration committee’s terms of reference are available from the Secretary and will be available for inspection at the Annual 
General Meeting.
Relations with shareholders
t he Board encourages two way communication with both its institutional and private investors and responds quickly to all 
queries received.  t he executive directors have met with analysts and institutional shareholders on a regular basis in the year 
ended 30 June 2010.  non-executive directors are fully briefed by the executive directors on the views of major shareholders 
about the company and are available for meetings with major shareholders.  All shareholders have at least twenty working days’ 
notice of the Annual General Meeting at which all directors and committee chairs are introduced and available for questions.
Accountability and audit
Financial reporting
A review of the performance and financial position of the Group is included in the Financial Review.  t he Board uses this, 
together with the chairman’s Statement, the chief executive’s Statement and the Directors’ Report on pages 3 to 49, to 
present a balanced and understandable assessment of the company’s position and prospects.  t he statement of directors’ 
responsibilities for the financial statements is described on page 59.
Internal control
An ongoing process for identifying, evaluating and managing the significant risks faced by the Group has been established and 
that process is regularly reviewed by the Board and accords with the revised version of Internal control Guidance for Directors 
on the combined code produced by the turnbull working party.  Following the latest review, the significant risks faced by the 
Group now total 30, of which six are considered principal risks as described on pages 45 and 46.  Steps continue to be taken 
to embed internal control and risk management further into the operations of the business and deal with areas of improvement 
coming to management and Board attention.  As part of this process, a corporate Governance Manual setting out the principle 
business policies and procedures operating within the Group has been produced and adopted by all businesses across the 
Group. 
corporate governance  (continued) t he reporting systems include formal consideration of all significant business risks at the monthly Board meetings and are 
still subject to continuous review by the Board throughout the year.  t he monthly management information includes key risk 
indicators with the emphasis on early warning systems.  Risk management principles are embedded within all significant 
projects.
t he directors are responsible for the system of internal control and reviewing its effectiveness.  Such a system is designed to 
manage rather than eliminate the risk of failure to achieve business objectives, and can provide only reasonable but not absolute 
assurance against material misstatement or loss.
t he key risk management activities are described under the following headings:
•	 Strategic control 
t he Board reviews the Group’s strategic plans each year and monitors progress throughout the year.  on a regular basis, 
the Group’s significant risks are updated and appropriate control strategies and accountabilities are agreed.
•	 Allocation of responsibilities and control environment 
t he Board has set clear terms of reference for each of its committees and the Group has an organisational structure with 
clear reporting lines for financial results, risk exposure and control assessment, and defined and documented delegated 
authorities are in place.
•	 quality and integrity of personnel 
t he Group is committed to competence and integrity of management and staff at all levels, through its values statement, 
comprehensive recruitment, training and appraisal programmes.
•	 Role of the executive directors 
Day-to-day management of the Group’s activities is delegated by the Board to the executive directors.  t hey monitor 
the effectiveness of the operating units in meeting Group objectives and controlling major business risks and make 
recommendations to the Board.
•	 Risk management reporting and Board review 
t he Board has overall responsibility for identifying, evaluating and managing major business risks facing the Group.  It 
regularly reviews all operating unit assessments of business risk exposure and control, including compliance assessments, 
and determines appropriate action, taking into account the recommendations of the executive directors.
•	 Operating unit controls 
Key controls over major business risks include reviews against performance indicators and exception reporting.  each 
operating unit’s senior management is responsible for identifying, evaluating and managing major business risks.  t hey 
make regular assessments of their exposure to major business risks and the extent to which these risks are controlled, 
which are reported to the Board on a monthly basis.
•	 Financial control 
t he Group has a comprehensive system for reporting financial results to the Board. t he performance of each business 
is reviewed monthly by local and Group management. each operating unit prepares monthly results with a comparison 
against budget.  t he Board reviews these for the Group as a whole and determines appropriate action. certain members 
of the Board sit on the boards of the main operating companies.
•	 Internal audit 
While there is no dedicated internal audit function, internal audit resources are provided by the central functions which 
are considered sufficient by the Group. t hey support the risk management activities and help to identify key risk areas 
across the Group. Any significant issues are reported to the Board via monthly reports. In particular, the Group commercial 
Director’s role includes the implementation of, and the monitoring of adherence to, the Group’s policies on key commercial 
issues, assisting in the validation of key commercial judgements taken, and ensuring that relevant training is provided for 
all key commercial staff as appropriate. 
•	 Controls over central functions 
A number of the Group’s key functions, including commercial, HR, Health and Safety and Finance, are monitored and 
managed centrally.  each function is required to report to the Board on a regular basis.
•	 IT systems 
t he Group has established controls and procedures over the security of data held on computer systems and suitable 
disaster recovery arrangements are in place.

St AteMentS 2010
An ongoing review of the effectiveness of the system of internal control for the year ended 30 June 2010 has been maintained 
and has taken account of any material developments since the year end.
COMPLIAnCE STATEMEnT
Although not required to, the Board reports on compliance with the forty eight code provisions throughout the accounting 
period.  Save for the exceptions outlined below, the company has complied throughout the accounting period ended 30 June 
2010 with the provisions set out in Section 1 of the code.  t he exceptions to the code were as follows:
A.4.1 t he directors have not constituted a nomination committee because they consider that it is preferable for elections  
 to the Board to be dealt with by the Board as a whole.
A.6 t he Board has not undertaken a formal evaluation of its own performance and that of its committees and individual  
 directors in 2010.  A satisfactory evaluation was undertaken in 2009.  t he directors believe that a formal evaluation  
 every two years is sufficient.  t he next formal evaluation will be undertaken in 2011 .
corporate governance  (continued) t he directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report and the financial statements in accordance with applicable law 
and regulations.
company law requires the directors to prepare financial statements for each financial year.  under that law the directors are 
required to prepare the group financial statements in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) 
as adopted by the european union and Article 4 of the IAS Regulation and have elected to prepare the parent company 
financial statements in accordance with united Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting p ractice (united Kingdom Accounting 
Standards and applicable law).  under company law the directors must not approve the accounts unless they are satisfied that 
they give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the company and of the profit or loss of the company for that period.  
In preparing the parent company financial statements, the directors are required to:
•	 select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently;
•	 make judgments and accounting estimates that are reasonable and prudent;
•	 state whether applicable uK Accounting Standards have been followed, subject to any material departures disclosed and 
explained in the financial statements; and
•	 prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis unless it is inappropriate to presume that the company will 
continue in business.
In preparing the group financial statements, International Accounting Standard 1 requires that directors:
•	 properly select and apply accounting policies;
•	 present information, including accounting policies, in a manner that provides relevant, reliable, comparable and 
understandable information; 
•	 provide additional disclosures when compliance with the specific requirements in IFRSs are insufficient to enable users to 
understand the impact of particular transactions, other events and conditions on the entity’s financial position and financial 
performance; and
•	 make an assessment of the company’s ability to continue as a going concern.
t he directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting records that are sufficient to show and explain the company’s 
transactions and disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position of the company and enable them to ensure 
that the financial statements comply with the companies Act 2006.  t hey are also responsible for safeguarding the assets of 
the company and hence for taking reasonable steps for the prevention and detection of fraud and other irregularities.
t he directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity of the corporate and financial information included on the 
company’s website.  Legislation in the united Kingdom governing the preparation and dissemination of financial statements 
may differ from legislation in other jurisdictions.
RESPOnSIBILIT y STATEMEnT 
We confirm that to the best of our knowledge:
•	 the financial statements, prepared in accordance with the relevant financial reporting framework, give a true and fair 
view of the assets, liabilities, financial position and profit or loss of the company and the undertakings included in the 
consolidation taken as a whole; and
•	 the management report, which is incorporated into the directors’ report, includes a fair review of the development and 
performance of the business and the position of the company and the undertakings included in the consolidation taken as 
a whole, together with a description of the principal risks and uncertainties that they face.

consolidated cash flow statement   |  Year ended 30 June 2010 1. GEnERAL InFORMATIOn
Interior Services Group plc is a company incorporated and domiciled in the united Kingdom under the companies Act. t he 
address of the registered office is given on page 43. t he nature of the Group’s operations and its principal activities are set out 
in the principal Activities section of the Directors’ Report on page 44.
t hese financial statements are presented in pounds Sterling (GBp) because that is the currency of the primary economic 
environment in which the Group operates. Foreign operations are included in accordance with the policies set out in note 3.
Restatement of companies balances 
certain balances have been reclassified to conform to the current year’s presentation of the discontinued operations.  t he 
directors consider that the restatement of the income statement has no impact on the Group’s reported balance sheet at 30 
June 2009 and consequently no comparative balance sheet for the year ended 30 June 2008 has been presented in these 
financial statements.
2. ADOPTIOn OF nEw AnD REVISED STAnDARDS
During the financial year, the following accounting standards and guidance were adopted by the Group:
•	 IAS 1 (revised) ‘Presentation of financial statements’; requires the presentation of the statement of changes in   
equity as a primary statement, separate from the income statement and the statement of comprehensive    
income. As a result, a statement of changes in equity is presented for each period.
•	 IFRS 3 (revised) ‘Business Combinations’; applies to business combinations occurring on or after 1 July 2009 and   
as such has not resulted in the restatement of comparative results. 
•	 Amendments to IFRS 7 ‘Financial instruments: Disclosures’; expand the disclosures in respect of fair    
value measurements and liquidity risk.
Additionally, the following pronouncements either had no impact on the financial statements or resulted in changes to 
presentation and disclosure only:
•	 IFRS 2 ‘Share-based payments’; effective for accounting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2009
•	 IAS 23 (revised) ‘Borrowing costs’; effective for accounting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2009
•	 IAS 27 ‘Consolidated and Separate Financial Statements’; effective for accounting periods beginning on or after   
1 July 2009
•	 IAS 32 ‘Financial Instruments: Presentation’; effective for accounting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2009
•	 IAS 39 ‘Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement – Eligible Hedged Items’; effective for accounting periods 
commencing on or after 1 January 2009
•	 IFRIc 15 ‘Agreements for the Construction of Real Estate’; effective for accounting periods beginning on or after 1  
January 2009
•	 IFRIc 16 ‘Hedges of a Net Asset Investment in a Foreign Operation’; effective for accounting periods beginning   
on or after 1 october 2008
•	 IFRIc 17 ‘Distributions of Non-cash Assets to Owners’; effective for accounting periods beginning on or after  
1 July 2009
At the date of authorisation of these financial statements, the following Standards and Interpretations relevant to the Group, 
which have not been applied in these financial statements, were in issue but not yet effective. In some cases these standards 
and guidance had not been endorsed by the european union:
•	 IAS 24 (revised) ‘Related Parties’; effective for accounting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2011
•	 Amendments to IAS 32 ‘Financial Instruments: Presentation’; effective for accounting periods beginning on or after 1 
February 2010
•	 Amendment to IFRS 2 ‘Share-based payment’; effective for accounting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2010
•	 Annual improvements to IFRSs (2010)

t he directors anticipate that the adoption of these Standards and Interpretations in future periods will have no material impact 
on the financial statements of the Group.
3. ACCOunTInG POLICIES
Basis of accounting 
t he annual consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting 
Standards (IFRS) adopted by the european union, International Financial Reporting Interpretations committee (IFRIc) 
Interpretations and the companies Act 2006 applicable to companies reporting under IFRS. t he financial statements have been 
prepared on a going concern basis. t his is discussed in the Directors’ Report on page 44. 
t he financial information set out in this report has been prepared under the historical cost convention. t he principal accounting 
policies adopted, all of which have been consistently applied, are set out below.  Areas involving a higher degree of judgement 
or complexity or areas where assumptions and estimates are significant to the consolidated financial statements are disclosed 
in note 4.
Basis of consolidation 
t he consolidated financial statements incorporate the financial statements of the company and all of its subsidiaries and joint 
ventures.  Subsidiaries are entities over which the Group has the power to control the financial and operating policies so as to 
obtain benefits from its activities and are included in the consolidated financial statements from the date on which control is 
transferred to the Group and cease to be consolidated from the date on which control is transferred out of the Group.
t he results of subsidiaries acquired or disposed of during the year are included in the consolidated income statement from the 
effective date of acquisition or up to the effective date of disposal, as appropriate.
Where necessary, adjustments are made to the financial statements of subsidiaries to bring the accounting policies used into 
line with those used by other members of the Group.
All intra-group transactions, balances, income and expenses are eliminated on consolidation.
Revenue recognition  
Revenue represents the fair value of consideration received or receivable for goods and services provided to external 
customers, net of trade discounts and excluding value added tax and similar sales based taxes.
•	 Revenue from construction contracts includes the amount initially agreed in the contract plus any variations in contract 
work to the extent that it is probable that the variation will result in revenue that can be reliably measured (usually when 
instructions have been received from the client). t he revenue recognised reflects the value of the contract at the reporting 
date, with reference to a survey of work performed. t he value of work carried out during the year includes amounts which 
have not been invoiced;
•	 Revenue from construction related service contracts is recognised in the income statement in the same proportion as the 
stage of completion of the contract at the reporting date, the stage of completion having been assessed with reference to 
a survey of the work performed;
•	 Interest income is accrued, by reference to the principal outstanding and the effective interest rate applicable;
•	 Dividend income is recognised when the right to receive payment is established.
Exceptional items 
exceptional items are disclosed and described separately in the financial statements where it is necessary to do so to provide 
further understanding of the financial performance of the Group. transactions which may give rise to disclosure as exceptional 
items are material items of income or expense due to the significance of their nature or amount and include gains or losses on 
disposal of businesses and investments, costs of restructuring and reorganising existing businesses, litigation and regulatory 
settlements, and asset impairments.
notes to the consolidated financial statements |  At 30 June 2010  (continued) Construction and service contracts 
Margin on long term contracts is recognised by reference to the stage of completion and the final estimated margin, provided 
that the final outcome can be assessed with reasonable certainty. t he stage of completion is measured with reference to the 
proportion of the value of the contract at the reporting date against the total estimated value of the contract.  
Where the outcome of the construction contract cannot be estimated reliably, contract revenue is recognised to the extent of 
contract costs incurred where it is probable they will be recoverable. contract costs are recognised as expenses in the period in 
which they are incurred. 
Full provision is made for all known or expected losses on individual contracts immediately, once such losses are foreseen.  
Pensions 
t he company operates a defined contribution pension scheme. t he assets of the scheme are invested and managed 
independently of the finances of the company. contributions to the defined contribution pension schemes are charged to the 
profit and loss account as they become payable in accordance with the rules of the schemes.
Business combinations 
Acquisition of subsidiaries and businesses are accounted for using the purchase method.  t he cost of an acquisition is 
measured at the aggregate of fair values, at the date of exchange, of assets given, liabilities incurred or assumed, and equity 
instruments issued by the Group in exchange for control of the acquiree, plus any costs directly attributable to the business 
combination.  t he acquiree’s identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities that meet the conditions for recognition 
under IFRS 3 ‘Business Combinations’ are recognised at their fair value at the acquisition date, except for non-current assets 
(or disposal groups) that are classified as held for resale in accordance with IFRS 5 ‘Non-Current Assets Held for Sale and 
Discontinued Operations’, which are recognised and measured at fair value less costs to sell. 
t he cost of business combinations includes, where applicable, deferred consideration discounted at an appropriate rate of 
interest to its fair value at the effective date of combination.
Goodwill 
Goodwill arising on acquisition is recognised as an asset and initially measured at cost, being the excess of the cost of the 
business combination over the Group’s interest in the net fair value of the identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities 
recognised.
Goodwill is reviewed for impairment annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying 
value may be impaired.  Any impairment is recognised immediately in the profit or loss and is not subsequently reversed.
For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill acquired in a business combination is, from the acquisition date, allocated to 
each of the Group’s cash-generating units, or groups of cash-generating units, that are expected to benefit from the synergies 
of the combination, irrespective of whether other assets or liabilities of the Group are assigned to those units or groups of 
units.
each unit or group of units to which the goodwill is allocated:
•	 represents the lowest level within the Group at which the goodwill is monitored for internal management purposes; and
•	 is not larger than a segment based on the Group’s reporting format determined in accordance with IFRS 8 ‘Operating 
segments’.
Impairment is determined for goodwill by assessing the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit or group of cash-
generating units, to which the goodwill relates.  Where an impairment test is performed a discounted cash flow analysis 
is carried out based on the cash flows of the cash-generating unit compared with the carrying value of that goodwill.  
Management estimate the discount rates as the risk effected cost of capital for the particular cash-generating units.  If the 
recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit is less than the carrying amount of the unit, the impairment loss is allocated 
first to reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill allocated to the unit and then to the other assets of the unit pro-rata on the 
basis of the carrying amount of each asset in the unit.  
on disposal of a subsidiary the attributable amount of goodwill is included in the determination of the profit or loss on disposal.

3. ACCOunTInG POLICIES (continued)
Intangible assets 
t he cost of intangible assets acquired in a business combination is recognised separately from goodwill if the asset is 
separable or arises from contractual or other legal rights and is based on its fair values as at the date of acquisition.  Following 
initial recognition, intangible assets are carried at cost and amortised over the estimated useful lives on a straight line basis. 
Intangible assets are assessed for impairment whenever there is an indication that the intangible asset may be impaired. t he 
categories of intangible assets (all of which were acquired on acquisition of subsidiaries) and their estimated useful lives are as 
follows: 
customer relationships  4-10 years
customer contracts   1-2 years
Property, plant and equipment 
property, plant and equipment are stated at historical cost net of accumulated depreciation and any recognised impairment 
loss.  cost includes expenditure associated with bringing the asset into use.
Depreciation is provided to write off the cost of assets in equal annual instalments over the estimated useful economic lives of 
its assets.  t he estimated useful lives are as follows:
Short-leasehold property  Life of the lease
Motor vehicles   4 years
It and office equipment  3-5 years
Assets held under finance leases are depreciated over their expected useful lives on the same basis as owned assets or, 
where shorter, over the term of the relevant lease. t he gain or loss arising on the disposal or retirement of an item of property, 
plant and equipment is determined as the difference between the sales proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset and is 
recognised in profit or loss.
Impairment of tangible and intangible assets excluding goodwill 
At each balance sheet date the Group reviews the carrying amounts of its tangible and intangible assets to determine whether 
there is any indication that those assets have suffered an impairment loss.  If any such indication exists, the recoverable amount 
of the asset is estimated in order to determine the extent of the impairment loss (if any).  Where the asset does not generate 
cash flows that are independent from other assets, the Group estimates the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit to 
which the asset belongs.
Recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs to sell or value in use.  In assessing value in use, the estimated future 
cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the 
time value of money and the risks specific to the asset for which the estimates of future cash flows have not been adjusted.
If the recoverable amount of an asset (or cash-generating unit) is estimated to be less than its carrying amount, the carrying 
amount of the asset (or cash-generating unit) is reduced to its recoverable amount.  An impairment loss is recognised as an 
expense immediately, unless the relevant asset is carried at a revalued amount, in which case the impairment loss is treated as 
a revaluation decrease.
Investments in associates and joint ventures 
An associate is an entity over which the Group has significant influence and that is neither a subsidiary nor an interest in a joint 
venture. Significant influence is the power to participate in the financial and operating policy decisions of the investee but is not 
control or joint control over those policies.
A joint venture is a contractual arrangement whereby the Group and other parties undertake an economic activity that is subject 
to joint control and the strategic financial and operating policy decisions relating to the activities of the joint venture require the 
unanimous consent of the parties sharing control.  t he arrangements the Group has entered into involve the establishment of a 
separate entity in which each venturer has an interest.   
Investments in associates and joint ventures are accounted for using the equity method of accounting; initially stated at cost 
and adjusted thereafter for subsequent changes in the Group’s share of net assets less any impairment in the value of individual 
investments.  t he Group’s share of associates’ and joint ventures’ post-tax results are reported in the consolidated income 
statement and the net investments disclosed in the consolidated balance sheet.
Any excess of the cost of acquisition over the Group’s share of the net fair value of the identifiable assets, liabilities and 
contingent liabilities of the associate and joint venture recognised at the date of acquisition is recognised as goodwill. 
notes to the consolidated financial statements |  At 30 June 2010  (continued) t he goodwill is included within the carrying amount of the investment and is assessed for impairment as part of the 
investment. Any excess of the Group’s share of the net fair value of the identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities 
over the cost of acquisition, after reassessment, is recognised immediately in profit or loss.
Inventories 
Inventories comprise stocks and property developments, which are valued at the lower of cost and net realisable value. cost, 
where appropriate, is determined using the first-in first-out method.  net realisable value represents the estimated selling price 
less all estimated costs of completion. provision is made for foreseeable losses. 
Leases 
Leases are classified as finance leases whenever the terms of the lease transfer substantially all the risks and rewards of 
ownership to the lessee. All other leases are classified as operating leases.
Assets held under finance leases or hire purchase contracts are initially recognised as assets of the Group at their fair value at 
the inception of the lease or, if lower, at the present value of the minimum lease payments. t he present value of future rentals 
is shown as a liability. t he interest element of rental obligations is charged to the profit and loss account over the period of the 
lease in proportion to the balance sheet repayments outstanding.
Rentals under operating leases are recognised as an expense on a straight-line basis over the lease term. 
In the event that lease incentives are received to enter into operating leases, such incentives are recognised as a liability. t he 
aggregate benefit of incentives is recognised as a reduction of rental expense on a straight-line basis.
Own shares 
o wn shares deducted in arriving at shareholders’ funds represent the cost of the company’s ordinary shares acquired by 
Interior Services Group employee trustees Limited in connection with the Group’s employee share schemes.
Share-based payments  
charges for employee services received in exchange for share-based payments have been made for all options that were 
granted after 7 november 2002 and had not yet vested at 1 January 2005 in accordance with IFRS 2 ‘Share-based Payments’.
options granted under the Group’s employee share schemes are equity settled and measured at fair value at the date of grant.  
t he fair value of such options has been calculated using the Black-Scholes model, based upon publicly available market data 
and based on the Group’s estimate of shares that will eventually vest and adjusted for the effect of non-market based vesting 
conditions, and is expensed over the vesting period. Vesting conditions are service and performance conditions. 
T axation 
t he tax expense represents the sum of the tax currently payable and deferred tax.
Current tax 
t he current tax payable is based on taxable profit for the year. taxable profit differs from net profit as reported in the income 
statement because it excludes items of income or expense that are taxable or deductible in other years and it further excludes 
items that are never taxable or deductible. t he Group’s liability for current tax is calculated using tax rates that have been 
enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax 
under IAS 12 ‘Income T axes’, deferred tax is recognised on differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in 
the financial statements and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable profit, and is accounted for using 
the balance sheet liability method. Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised for all taxable temporary differences, and 
deferred tax assets are generally recognised for all deductible temporary differences to the extent that it is probable that taxable 
profits will be available against which those deductible temporary differences can be utilised. Such assets and liabilities are not 
recognised if the temporary difference arises from goodwill or from the initial recognition (other than in a business combination) 
of other assets and liabilities in a transaction that affects neither the tax profit nor the accounting profit.
Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for taxable temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries and 
associates, and interests in joint ventures, except where the Group is able to control the reversal of the temporary difference 
and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future. Deferred tax assets arising from 
deductible temporary differences associated with such investments and interests are only recognised to the extent that it is 
probable that there will be sufficient taxable profits against which to utilise the benefits of the temporary differences and they 
are expected to reverse in the foreseeable future.
69 RepoR t  
AnD FInAncIAL 
St AteMentS 2010
3. ACCOunTInG POLICIES (continued)
T axation (continued)
t he carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each balance sheet date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer 
probable that sufficient taxable profits will be available to allow all or part of the asset to be recovered.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period in which the liability is 
settled or the asset realised, based on tax rates (and tax laws) that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance 
sheet date. t he measurement of deferred tax liabilities and assets reflects the tax consequences that would follow from the 
manner in which the Group expects, at the reporting date, to recover or settle the carrying amount of its assets and liabilities.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to set off current tax assets against current 
tax liabilities and when they relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority and the Group intends to settle its 
current tax assets and liabilities on a net basis.
Current and deferred tax for the period 
current and deferred tax are recognised as an expense or income in profit or loss, except when they relate to items credited 
or debited directly to equity, in which case the tax is also recognised directly in equity, or where they arise from the initial 
accounting for a business combination. In the case of a business combination, the tax effect is taken into account in calculating 
goodwill or in determining the excess of the acquirer’s interest in the net fair value of the acquiree’s identifiable assets, liabilities 
and contingent liabilities over cost.
Financial assets  
Financial assets are recognised on the Group’s balance sheet when the Group becomes a party to the contractual provisions of 
the instrument.
Trade and other receivables 
trade and other receivables are measured on initial recognition at fair value, and are subsequently measured at amortised cost, 
less any impairment.  
In relation to trade receivables, a provision for impairment is made when there is objective evidence that the Group will not 
be able to collect all of the amounts due in accordance with the original terms of those receivables.  t he carrying amount of 
the receivable is reduced through use of an allowance account.  Impaired debts are derecognised when they are assessed as 
uncollectible.
Cash and cash equivalents 
cash and cash equivalents comprise cash at bank and at hand and short-term highly-liquid investments that are readily 
convertible (with a maturity of three months or less) to a known amount of cash and are subject to an insignificant risk of 
changes in value.  
Bank overdrafts that are repayable on demand and form an integral part of the Group’s cash management are included as a 
component of cash and cash equivalents for the purpose of the consolidated cash flow statement.
Impairment of financial assets 
Financial assets are assessed for indicators of impairment at each balance sheet date.  Financial assets are impaired where 
there is objective evidence that, as a result of one or more events that occurred after the initial recognition of the financial 
asset, the estimated future cash flows of the investment have been impacted.
For financial assets objective evidence of impairment could include:
•	 significant financial difficulty of the issuer or counterparty; or
•	 default or delinquency in interest or principal payments; or
•	 it becoming probable that the borrower will enter bankruptcy or financial re-organisation.
t he carrying amount of the financial asset is reduced by the impairment loss directly for all financial assets with the exception 
of trade receivables, where the carrying amount is reduced through the use of a provision account.  
Derecognition of financial assets 
t he Group derecognises a financial asset only when the contractual rights to the cash flows from the assets have expired or 
have been transferred and the Group has transferred substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership.   If the Group neither 
notes to the consolidated financial statements |  At 30 June 2010  (continued) transfers nor retains substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership and continues to control the transferred asset, the 
Group recognises its retained interest in the asset and an associated liability for amounts it may have to pay. If the Group 
retains substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of a transferred financial asset, the Group continues to recognise the 
financial asset and also recognises a collateralised borrowing for the proceeds received.
Financial liabilities 
Financial liabilities and equity instruments are classified according to the substance of the contractual arrangements entered 
into.  
Equity instruments 
An equity instrument is any contract that evidences a residual interest in the assets of an entity after deducting all of its 
liabilities. equity instruments issued by the Group are recorded at the proceeds received, net of direct issue costs.
Financial guarantee contract liabilities 
Financial guarantee contract liabilities are measured at the amount of the obligation under the contract, as determined in 
accordance with IAS 37 ‘provisions, contingent Liabilities and contingent Assets’.
All loans and borrowings are initially recognised at fair value less directly attributable transaction costs.  After initial recognition 
interest-bearing loans and borrowings are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method. 
Finance charges, including premiums payable on settlement or redemption and direct issue costs, are accounted for on an 
accruals basis in the income statement using the effective interest rate method and are added to the carrying amount of the 
instrument to the extent that they are not settled in the period in which they arise.
Trade payables 
trade payables are not interest bearing and are stated at their nominal value.
Borrowings 
Gains and losses are recognised in the income statement when the liabilities are derecognised as well as through the 
amortisation process.
Finance costs  
Finance costs of debts are capitalised against the debt value on first drawdown of the debt and are recognised in the Income 
Statement using the effective interest rate method.
Derecognition of financial liabilities 
A financial liability is derecognised when the contract that gives rise to it is settled, sold, cancelled or expires.
Provisions 
provisions are recognised when the Group has a present obligation (legal or constructive) as a result of a past event, it is 
probable that the Group will be required to settle that obligation, and a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the 
obligation.
t he amount recognised as a provision is the best estimate of the consideration required to settle the present obligation at the 
balance sheet date, taking into account the risks and uncertainties surrounding the obligation. Where a provision is measured 
using the cash flows estimated to settle the present obligation, its carrying amount is the present value of those cash flows.
When some or all of the economic benefits required to settle a provision are expected to be recovered from a third party, 
the receivable is recognised as an asset if it is virtually certain that reimbursement will be received and the amount of the 
receivable can be measured reliably.
Onerous property contracts 
provision for onerous lease commitments on property contracts is based on an estimate of the net unavoidable lease and other 
payments in respect of these properties. t hese comprise rental and other property costs payable, plus any termination costs, 
less any income expected to be derived from the properties being sublet. t he provisions are discounted at an appropriate rate 
to take into account the time value of money.
Foreign currencies  
t he individual financial statements of each Group entity are presented in the currency of the primary economic environment 
in which the entity operates (its functional currency). For the purpose of the consolidated financial statements, the results and 
financial position of each Group company are expressed in pound Sterling, which is the functional currency of the company, and 
the presentation currency for the consolidated financial statements.

Foreign currencies (continued)
transactions in foreign currencies are translated into the Group company’s functional currency (Sterling) at the exchange rate 
ruling at the date of the transaction.  Monetary assets and liabilities in foreign currencies are translated at the rates of exchange 
ruling at the balance sheet date.  non-monetary items that are measured at historical cost in a foreign currency are translated at 
the exchange rate at the date of the transaction.  non-monetary items that are measured at fair value in a foreign currency are 
translated using the exchange rate at the date when the fair value was determined.
Any exchange differences arising on the settlement of monetary items or on translating monetary items at rates different from 
those at which they were initially recorded are recognised in the profit or loss in the period in which they arise.  exchange 
differences on non-monetary items are recognised in the statement of recognised income and expenses to the extent that they 
relate to a gain or loss on that non-monetary item taken to the statement of recognised income and expenses, otherwise such 
gains and losses are recognised in the income statement.
t he assets and liabilities in the financial statements of foreign subsidiaries and related goodwill are translated into Sterling at 
the rate of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date.  Income and expenses are translated at the actual rate.  t he exchange 
differences arising from the retranslation of the opening net investment in subsidiaries are taken directly to the “foreign 
currency translation reserve” in equity.  on disposal of a foreign operation the cumulative translation differences (including, if 
applicable, gains and losses on related hedges) are transferred to the income statement as part of the gain or loss on disposal.
4. CRITICAL ACCOunTInG JuDGEMEnTS AnD KEy SOuRCES OF ESTIMATIOn  
 unCERTAInTy 
t he preparation of consolidated financial statements under IFRS requires management to make judgements, estimates and 
assumptions about the carrying amount of assets and liabilities and the amount of income and revenue recognised in the 
period. Actual results may differ from these estimates.
t he key assumptions concerning the future, and other key sources of estimation uncertainty at the balance sheet date, that 
have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial 
year, are discussed below.  
Revenue and profit/margin recognition 
t he Group’s revenue recognition and long term contracts policies are set out in note 3 above. t hese policies are central to 
the way in which the Group values the work it has carried out at each reporting date and the estimation of the percentage 
completion of the contract. t hese policies require forecasts to be made of the outcome of long-term construction and service 
contracts and require assessments and judgements to be made on the recovery of pre-contract costs, changes in work scopes, 
expected contract costs to complete and the progress on contract programmes. t he Group has appropriate control procedures 
in place to ensure estimates are calculated on a consistent basis.
Impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets 
Determining whether goodwill is impaired requires an estimation of the value in use of the cash-generating units to which 
goodwill has been allocated. t he value in use calculation requires the directors to estimate the future cash flows expected to 
arise from the cash-generating unit and a suitable discount rate in order to calculate present value. note 3 above and note 16 
details the assumptions that have been applied in assessing impairment of goodwill.
T axation 
t he Group is subject to tax in a number of jurisdictions and judgement is required in determining the worldwide provision for 
income taxes. t he Group provides for future liabilities in respect of uncertain tax positions where additional tax may become 
payable in future periods, and such provisions are based upon management’s assessment of exposures. 
As set out in note 3 above, deferred tax is accounted for on temporary differences using the liability method, with deferred tax 
liabilities generally being provided for in full and deferred tax assets being recognised to the extent that it is probable that future 
taxable profits will be available against which the temporary differences can be utilised. note 29 details the unused tax losses 
for which deferred tax assets have not been recognised and the undistributed reserves of subsidiaries for which deferred tax 
liabilities have not been provided, together with the judgements which the Group has made in respect of these matters. t hese 
judgements may change in the future and they will be reviewed at each balance sheet date.
Regulatory investigations 
note 7 explains the risk in relation to ongoing investigations by the office of Fair trading into potential breaches of competition 
law in respect of certain Group companies which occurred prior to ISG’s ownership.
notes to the consolidated financial statements |  At 30 June 2010  (continued) 5. SEGMEnTAL InFORMATIOn
For management purposes, the Group is organised into operating divisions on both a geographic and product perspective. t he 
performances of these divisions are considered by the Board when making strategic decisions. Geographically, the uK, europe, 
the Middle east and Asia are considered. t he uK is further segregated by product into London Fit out, London construction, 
Regional construction and Retail. 
Although the europe, Middle east and Asia segments do not meet the quantitative thresholds required by IFRS 8 ‘Operating 
Segments’, management has concluded that these segments should be reported. All are closely monitored by the Board as 
potential growth regions and are expected to materially contribute to Group revenue in the future.
t he principal activities of each of these divisions are as follows:
L ondon	Fit	Out	 	 −	 pro vision	of	fit	out	ser vices	in	L ondon.
L ondon	Constr uction	 −	 pro vision	of	ne w	build	and	refurbishment	in	L ondon.

t he segmental information provided to the Board for the reportable segments for the years ended 30 June 2010 and 30 June 
2009 is as follows:
a. Revenue and profit analysis
t he revenue disclosed is from external customers and is reported to the Board in a manner consistent with that in the income 
statement.

7. Ex CEPTIOnAL ITEMS
As reported in last year’s financial statements, two of ISG’s subsidiaries, propencity Group Limited and pearce construction 
(Midlands) Limited, a dormant subsidiary of ISG pearce Limited, were investigated by the office of Fair trading (oFt) for 
technical breaches of competition law in earlier years prior to ISG’s ownership.
propencity Group Limited entered into a leniency agreement with the oFt in respect of the alleged infringements and 
submitted a response to the oFt’s Statement of objections. p earce construction (Midlands) Limited was issued with a 
Statement of objections and has been defending its position. ISG has a £2.0m cash backed indemnity from the vendors of 
ISG pearce Holdings Limited, being cash of £1 .0m held in an escrow bank account and the remainder being the outstanding 
deferred consideration from the original acquisition of ISG pearce Holdings Limited.
on 20 September 2009, the oFt published a list of fines for 103 uK construction companies, including p ropencity Group 
Limited and pearce construction (Midlands) Limited. t he oFt subsequently announced the findings of its investigation on 20 
november 2009.
t he fine for propencity Group Limited was abated due to its full co-operation with the oFt during its investigation and the fine 
of £98,042 has been paid.
t he oFt has fined p earce construction (Midlands) Limited £5.2m of which £4.4m is on a joint and several basis with the 
company’s former owner, crest nicholson plc.  Appeals were submitted to the competition Appeal tribunal on 24 november 
2009 in respect of the quantum of fine imposed, the methodology upon which the fine was calculated, and the inclusion of ISG 
pearce Limited as an entity responsible for the infringement. crest nicholson plc has also lodged an appeal. As a result, the fine 
has not been paid and an application has been made to pay any resultant fine due over a three year period.  t he appeals were 
heard by the competition Appeal tribunal in July 2010 and we await their findings.
As at the date of issuing these accounts, no agreement has been reached with crest nicholson plc over the apportionment of 
the fine and the results of the various appeals to the oFt are not known.
t he Board has considered all the information available and assessed potential outcomes relating to the above fines, the joint 
and several liability with crest nicholson plc and estimated legal costs of the appeal, and a provision has been made in these 
accounts.

In April 2010, the Group decided to close its Japanese operation and it has been classified as a discontinued operation for 
the year ended 30 June 2010, and the results for the year ended 30 June 2009 restated for the presentation of the Japanese 
operations as a discontinued operation.
t he 2010 results include a charge to the income statement in respect of the discontinued operations of £768,000. t he directors 
consider that the restatement of the income statement has no impact on the Group’s reported balance sheet at 30 June 2009 
and consequently no comparative balance sheet for the year ended 30 June 2008 has been presented in these statements.
t he results of the Group’s discontinued operations in 2010 are presented below together with the comparative information for 
2009 and arise solely from the Japanese operations in respect of Japan.

15. EARnInGS PER SHARE
Basic earnings per share is calculated by dividing the earnings attributable to ordinary shareholders by the weighted average 
number of ordinary shares during the period, determined in accordance with the provisions of IAS 33 ‘Earnings per Share’.
Diluted earnings per share is calculated by adjusting the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue on the 
assumption of conversion of all dilutive potential ordinary shares.  t he Group has only one category of dilutive potential ordinary 
shares, being share options granted where the exercise price is less than the average price of the company’s ordinary shares 
during the period.
Adjusted basic earnings per share is calculated by dividing the earnings attributed from continuing operations to ordinary 
shareholders, before exceptional items and amortisation of intangible assets, by the weighted average number of ordinary 
shares during the period.  t he Group believes that this measure of earnings from continuing operations before exceptional 
items is more reflective of the ongoing trading of the Group.
A total of 3,033,458 share options that could potentially dilute earnings per share in the future were excluded from the below 
calculations because they were anti-dilutive at 30 June 2010 (2009: 4,182,609).

Goodwill has been allocated for impairment testing purposes to six groups of cash-generating units (cGus) identified 
according to operating segments, being London Fit out, London construction, Regional construction, Retail, europe and 
Asia, as disclosed in note 5. t he allocation of goodwill is dependent on the cGu that is expected to benefit from the business 
combination.
t he Group tests goodwill bi-annually for impairment or more frequently if there are indications that goodwill might be impaired. 
t he recoverable amounts of the cGus are determined from value in use calculations. t he key assumptions for the value in use 
calculations are those regarding the discount rates and growth rates for the period.  t he Board estimates discount rates using 
pre-tax rates that reflect current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the business, giving a 
pre-tax discount rate of 11 .1% (2009: 10.5%). t he Group discount rate is applied to all cGus, on a pre-tax basis.  t he long term 
growth rate of 2.25% is based on the estimated industry growth forecasts and long-term growth in gross domestic product. 
t he Group prepares cash flow forecasts derived from the most recent financial forecasts approved by the Board for the 
next two years and extrapolates cash flows for the following three years based on the estimated growth rate of 2.25% and 
thereafter applied into perpetuity. 
At 30 June 2010 and 30 June 2009, the carrying amounts of goodwill for cGus were tested for impairment and deemed not to 
be impaired. 
t he Group’s impairment review is sensitive to changes in the key assumptions used.  t he major assumptions that result in 
significant sensitivities are the growth rate and the discount rate.
A reasonably possible change in a single assumption will not cause impairment in any of the Group’s cGus.  However, a 
significant adverse change in the key assumptions would result in an impairment in the Regional construction cGu as its fair 
value currently exceeds its carrying value by approximately 10% and in the europe cGu as its fair value currently exceeds its 
varying value by approximately 24%.  t he carrying value of the goodwill of Regional construction cGu is £29m and of europe 
cGu £11m.

t he Board consider that the carrying amounts of financial assets and financial liabilities recorded at amortised cost in the 
financial statements approximate to their fair values due to the short maturity of the instruments or because they bear interest 
at rates approximate to the market.  
Financial risk management 
t he Group’s activities expose it to a variety of risks, the key risks identified being:
•	 Market risk
•	 credit risk
•	 Foreign currency risk 
•	 Liquidity risk
•	 Interest rate risk
notes to the consolidated financial statements |  At 30 June 2010  (continued) t his note presents information about the Group’s exposure to each of the above risks and the Group’s objectives, policies and 
procedures for measuring and managing risk.  please refer also to the principal business risks in the Directors’ Report on pages 
45 to 46 and also the corporate Governance statement on pages 55 to 58.
Market risk 
Market risk is the risk that changes in the market prices, such as foreign exchange rates and interest rates, will affect the 
Group’s income or the value of its holdings of financial instruments.  t he objective of market risk management is to manage and 
control market risk exposures within acceptable parameters, while optimising the return on risk.
t he Group’s activities expose it mainly to the financial risks of changes in foreign currency exchange rates and changes in 
interest rates. t he Board reviewed and agreed the policy for managing interest rate risk and foreign currency risk and the 
potential impact of any significant economic changes are discussed at monthly Board meetings. Refer to both foreign currency 
risk and interest rate risk headings below.
t he Group does not use derivative contracts for speculative purposes.
Credit risk 
credit risk refers to the risk that a counterparty will default on its contractual obligations resulting in financial loss to the Group. 
t he Group has adopted a policy of only dealing with creditworthy counterparties as a means of mitigating the risk of financial 
loss from defaults. 
t he Group’s principal financial assets are cash and cash equivalents, trade and other receivables, prepayments and accrued 
income, which represent the Group’s maximum exposure to credit risk in relation to financial assets.
t he Group’s credit risk is primarily attributable to its trade and other receivables.  t he amounts presented in the consolidated 
balance sheet are net of allowances for doubtful receivables, estimated by the Group’s management based on prior experience 
and their assessment of the current economic environment.
t he credit risk on liquid funds is limited because the counterparties are banks with high credit-ratings assigned by international 
credit-rating agencies such as Standard and poor’s, Moody’s and Fitch.  no credit exposure is permitted to a financial institution 
with a rating lower then A+ or equivalent.  t he Group’s exposure and the credit ratings of its counterparties are continuously 
monitored and the aggregate value of transactions concluded is spread amongst approved financial institutions.
Trade receivables 
trade receivables consist of a large number of customers, spread across diverse geographical areas and the Group’s exposure 
to credit risk is influenced mainly by the individual characteristics of each customer. t he demographics of the Group’s customer 
base, including default risk of the industry and country in which the customers operate, has less of an influence on credit risk.
t he Group does not have any significant credit risk exposure to any single counterparty or any group of counterparties having 
similar characteristics. t he Group defines counterparties as having similar characteristics if they are related entities.  
t he Group establishes an allowance for impairment that represents its estimate of incurred losses in respect of trade and 
other receivables and investments when there is objective evidence that the asset is impaired.  t he main components of this 
allowance are a specific loss component that relates to individually significant exposures, and a collective loss component 
established for groups of similar assets in respect of losses that have been incurred but not yet identified.  t he collective loss 
allowance is determined by references to past default experience and historical data of payment statistics for similar financial 
assets.  
Before accepting any new customer, the Group runs credit checks to assess the potential customer’s credit quality.  t he 
company monitors exposure to individual clients and all customers are subject to standard terms of payment for each division.

Foreign currency risk 
t he Group has international operations and is exposed primarily to the euro (euR) and Singapore Dollars (SGD), hence 
exposures to exchange rate fluctuations arise. t he main risk is from net investments in foreign operations, recognised assets 
and liabilities and future trading transactions. 
t he current level of foreign business is approximately 8% (2009: 16%) of the Group’s trading operating profit before Group 
activities as presented in note 5.  
t he Group monitors the net balance sheet exposure to foreign currency movements and would consider hedging against any 
material exposure arising.  
prior year hedging instruments of €7 .5m were entered into to cover exchange rate fluctuations on the Group’s european 
earnings. All instruments were repaid before 30 June 2009 and as such none existed at the balance sheet date. t he accounting 
treatment of exchange gains and losses relating to foreign activities is described in note 3.
During the year the Group made a decision not to hedge any exposure to fluctuations in the value of the euro and Singapore 
Dollar against the British pound since it believed that it would not be in the interests of the business.
Foreign exchange risk is reviewed on a regular basis by the Finance Department and the Board and if considered necessary a 
strategy to minimise any potential risk will be discussed and implemented. Significant foreign exchange movements are also 
reviewed by the Board and the process of reviewing different options is undertaken on a quarterly basis. 
t he carrying amounts of the Group’s foreign currency denominated monetary assets and monetary liabilities, relating to 
operations carried out in local functional currencies, at the reporting date are as follows:

t he Group is mainly exposed to the euro and Singapore dollars.  A 10% increase/decrease in the GBp against the SGD has a 
circa £55,000 (2009: £119,000) impact on trading operating profits and a 10% increase/decrease in the GBp against the euR 
has a circa £37 ,000 (2009: £228,000) impact on trading operating profits. t his analysis assumes all other variables, in particular 
interest rates, remain constant. 
Liquidity risk 
Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group will not be able to meet its financial obligations as they fall due.  Responsibility for 
liquidity risk management rests with the Board of directors.  t he Group manages liquidity risk by maintaining adequate 
reserves, banking facilities and reserve borrowing facilities, by continuously monitoring bank covenant compliance, forecast and 
actual cash flows and matching the maturity profiles of financial assets and liabilities. Included in note 25 is a description of the 
additional undrawn facility that the Group has at its disposal to further reduce liquidity risk.   
Further details relevant to the Group’s liquidity position and its status as a going concern are included within the Directors’ 
Report on page 44.
t he Group reviews its treasury position daily, placing surplus cash on short-term deposits.  A daily cash flow forecast for the 
next three weeks and a weekly cash flow forecast for the following nine weeks are prepared on a weekly basis and reviewed at 
company and Group level. At each month end a twelve month cash flow is prepared by each company and submitted to Group.  
Minimum cleared cash levels have been imposed on each company and actual balances are monitored against the minimum 
levels on a daily basis.  In addition the top and bottom ten cash contracts by company are reviewed at company and Group level 
on a monthly basis.  
Liquidity and interest risk tables

Interest rate risk 
Interest rate risk is the risk that the value of a financial instrument or cash flows associated with the instrument, will fluctuate 
due to changes in market interest rates.  t he Group’s only interest-bearing asset is cash, which is invested in short-term 
deposits.
t he Group is exposed to interest rate risk primarily through borrowing funds at floating interest rates.  Borrowings issued at 
variable rates expose the Group to cash flow interest rate risk. t he Group manages interest rate risk on borrowings by ensuring 
access to diverse funding and through monitoring interest rate movements with weekly reports.  
Interest rate risk is reviewed on a regular basis and if considered necessary a strategy to minimise any potential risk through 
interest rate swaps is discussed and implemented. currently the effect of interest rate changes on net interest income and 
expense is immaterial to the Group. Risk arises on the variance between the Bank of england Base Rate and the LIBoR rate. 
t he Group’s exposure to interest rates on financial assets and financial liabilities are detailed below.  
Interest rate sensitivity analysis 
If interest rates had been 100 basis points higher or lower and all other variables were held constant, the Group’s profit for the 
year would increase or decrease by £163,352 (2009: £110,992) in respect to exposure to the Group’s borrowings.  However this 
exposure is largely mitigated by cash balances held by the Group throughout the year.

More An analysis of the maturity of debt is given in note 25.  
t he Group’s policy is to fix payment terms when agreeing the terms of each transaction.  It is the Group’s general policy to pay 
suppliers according to the agreed terms and conditions, provided that the supplier has complied with those terms. t he Group 
has financial risk management policies in place to ensure that all payables are paid within the credit timeframe. t herefore, under 
the normal course of business, the Group is not charged interest on overdue payables.
t here are no suppliers who represent more than 10% of the total balance of trade creditors in either 2010 or 2009.
Deferred consideration of £4,555,000 in the prior year payable on the acquisitions as at 30 June 2010 was fulfilled in cash of 
£1,021,000 and shares worth £2,479,000. t hese amounts were paid in September 2009.  t he remaining £1,055,000 is part of

29. DEFERRED TAx (continued)
 
At the balance sheet date, there were unused tax losses of approximately £14.5m (2009: £18.5m) which are available for offset 
against future profits.
t here is an unrecognised deferred tax asset of £4.5m (2009: £5.5m) in respect of tax losses in certain companies, which has 
not been recognised in these accounts as the timing of the recoverability of this is considered uncertain, these may be carried 
forward indefinitely.
At the balance sheet date, undistributed earnings of overseas subsidiaries for which deferred tax liabilities have not been 
recognised was £6.3m (2009: £7 .3m). no liability has been recognised in respect of these earnings because either the Group 
is in a position to control the timing of the reversal of the temporary differences or it is probable that such differences will not 
reverse in the foreseeable future.  Where it is probable that they will reverse no additional uK tax is expected.

whole and recommend that shareholders vote in favour of all the resolutions, as they intend to do in respect of their own 
beneficial shareholdings in the company.

notice of Annual General Meeting  (continued) notes to the notice of the Meeting:
1. A shareholder entitled to attend and vote at the Annual General Meeting (the “AGM”) is entitled to appoint a proxy to 
exercise all or any of his rights to attend, speak and vote at the AGM on his behalf.  A shareholder may appoint more than 
one proxy in relation to the AGM provided that each proxy is appointed to exercise the rights attached to a different share 
or shares held by that shareholder.  A proxy need not be a shareholder of the company.  A proxy form which may be used 
to make such appointment and give proxy instructions accompanies this notice.
2. to appoint a proxy or proxies shareholders must complete either (a) a form of proxy which they should sign and return, 
together with the power of attorney or any other authority under which it is signed, or a notarially certified copy of such 
authority, to the company’s registrars, capita Registrars, pxS, 34 Beckenham Road, Beckenham, BR3 4tu; or (b) a cReS t 
proxy Instruction (see note 6 below); or (c) an online proxy appointment at www.capitaregistrars.com; in each case so 
that it is received not later than 48 hours before the time fixed for the AGM or any adjournment thereof.  Appointment of a 
proxy will not preclude shareholders from attending and voting in person at the AGM.
3. copies of all directors’ service contracts, or where any such contract is not reduced to writing, a memorandum of the 
terms thereof are available for inspection at the registered office of the company during normal business hours (Saturdays, 
Sundays and public holidays excluded).
4. copies of the rules of the pSp are available for inspection at the registered office of the company during normal business 
hours (Saturdays, Sundays and public holidays excluded) until the close of the AGM and will also be available for inspection 
at the place of the AGM for at least 15 minutes prior to, and during, the AGM. 
5. pursuant to Regulation 41 of the uncertificated Securities Regulations 2001, only those shareholders who are registered 
on the company’s share register at 11 .30am on 1 December 2010, being not more than 48 hours prior to the time fixed 
for the AGM or, if the AGM is adjourned, such time being not more than 48 hours prior to the time fixed for the adjourned 
AGM, shall be entitled to attend the AGM and vote in respect of the number of shares registered in their name at that 
time.  changes to entries on the share register made after this time will be disregarded in determining the rights of any 
person to attend and/or vote at the AGM.
6. cReS t members who wish to appoint a proxy or proxies through the cReS t electronic proxy appointment service may do 
so for the AGM and any adjournment(s) of the meeting, by using the procedures described in the cReS t Manual (available 
via http://www.euroclear.com/cReS t).  cReS t p ersonal Members or other cReS t sponsored members and those cReS t 
members who have appointed a voting service provider should refer to their cReS t sponsor or voting service provider 
who will be able to take appropriate action on their behalf. 
 
In order for a proxy appointment or instruction made using the cReS t service to be valid, the appropriate cReS t message 
(a “CREST Proxy Instruction”) must be properly authenticated in accordance with euroclear uK & Ireland Limited’s 
specifications, and must contain the information required for such instructions, as described in the cReS t Manual. t he 
message, regardless of whether it constitutes the appointment of a proxy or an amendment to the instruction given to 
a previously appointed proxy must, in order to be valid, be transmitted so as to be received by the company’s agent (ID 
RA10) by the latest time for receipt of proxy appointments set out in note 2 above.  For this purpose, the time of receipt 
will be taken to be the time (as determined by the timestamp applied to the message by the cReS t Applications Host) 
from which the company’s agent is able to retrieve the message by enquiry to cReS t in the manner prescribed by cReS t. 
After this time any change of instructions to proxies appointed through cReS t should be communicated to the appointee 
through other means.  
 
cReS t members and, where applicable, their cReS t sponsors or voting service provider(s), should note that euroclear 
uK & Ireland Limited does not make available special procedures in cReS t for any particular messages. normal system 
timings and limitations will therefore apply in relation to the input of cReS t p roxy Instructions. It is the responsibility of the 
cReS t member concerned to take (or, if the cReS t member is a cReS t p ersonal Member or cReS t sponsored member 
or has appointed any voting service provider, to procure that his cReS t sponsor or voting service provider takes) such 
action as is necessary to ensure that a message is transmitted by means of the cReS t system by any particular time. In 
this connection, cReS t members and, where applicable, their cReS t sponsors or voting service providers are referred, in 
particular, to those sections of the cReS t Manual concerning practical limitations of the cReS t system and timings. 
 
t he company may treat as invalid a cReS t p roxy Instruction in the circumstances set out in Regulation 35(5)(a) of the 
uncertificated Securities Regulations 2001 .

Explanatory notes on the resolutions
Resolutions 1 to 10 are ordinary resolutions.  These resolutions will be passed if more than 50% of the votes cast for or 
against the resolution are in favour.
Resolutions 1 and 2 - Receiving the audited accounts and associated reports 
t he 2006 Act requires that for each financial year, the directors present the company’s accounts, the directors’ report and the 
auditors’ report before the AGM of the shareholders of the company.  [t he directors are also seeking approval of the directors’ 
report to the shareholders on directors’ remuneration.]
Resolutions 3 and 4 - Reappointment of auditors and authority to determine auditors’ remuneration  
t he 2006 Act requires that the company shall, at each general meeting at which accounts are presented, appoint an auditor or 
auditors to hold office from the conclusion of that meeting until the conclusion of the next general meeting at which accounts 
are presented.  Accordingly, the directors propose to reappoint the company’s auditors, Deloitte LLp, as the auditors of the 
company and the directors are also seeking shareholder approval to fix the amount of their fees. 
Resolution 5 – Declaration of a Final Dividend 
t he directors are recommending a final dividend of 10.14 pence per ordinary share of 1 pence, payable on 7 December 2010 to 
holders on the register as at 6.00pm on 5 november 2010.  t he final dividend will not be paid without shareholder approval and 
its amount may not exceed the amount recommended by the directors.
Resolutions 6, 7 and 8 - Reappointment of directors 
Article 96 of the company’s articles of association requires that directors shall retire from office at the AGM unless they have 
been reappointed as a director at either of the last two annual general meetings.  Article 97 states that directors retiring in 
accordance with Article 96 shall be eligible for re-election.  Accordingly, S D Lawther and J R Stevenson are retiring and are 
seeking re-election.  
J L Jeremy is retiring (due to his length of service he retires at each annual general meeting) and is also seeking re-election. 
Directors seeking re-election 
S D Lawther joined the group in June 2001 as Group Finance Director and was appointed to the position of chief executive 
officer in July 2006.  He is chairman of both our French subsidiary, ISG europe SAS, and our Asia subsidiary, ISG Asia 
Investment (Hong Kong) Limited.
J R Stevenson was appointed as a non-executive director of the company in April 2007 .  He is a member of both the Audit 
committee and the Remuneration committee.  He worked for twenty years as an analyst in the city for a number of firms 
including Wood MacKenzie, Savory Milln and Dresdner Kleinwort.
J L Jeremy has been a non-executive director of the company since 1995.  He is a former merchant banker and he is an 
Associate of the Institute of Financial Services.  He has run his own consultancy business since 1993.  He is chairman of the 
Remuneration committee, a member of the Audit committee and is also the Senior Independent Director.  Due to his length of 
service with the company the Board agreed that he should submit himself for re-election every year from 2007 onwards.
Resolution 9 - Authority to allot shares and securities 
t he 2006 Act provides that the directors may only allot shares if authorised by shareholders to do so.  At the AGM, 
shareholders will be asked to renew the directors’ authority to allot new shares, to grant options to subscribe for new shares 
and to issue securities that are convertible into new shares under section 551 of the 2006 Act.  t his authority will be limited 
to an aggregate nominal amount of £221,056, which represents approximately two thirds of the current issued ordinary share 
capital.  As provided in paragraph (a) of the resolution, up to half of this authority (equal to one-third of the issued share capital 
of the company) will enable directors to allot and issue new shares, to grant options to subscribe for new shares and to 
issue securities that are convertible into new shares, in whatever manner they see fit (subject to relevant pre-emption rights).  
paragraph (b) of the resolution provides that the remainder of the authority (equal to a further one-third) may only be used in 
connection with a rights issue or other pre-emptive offer or issue in favour of ordinary shareholders.  As paragraph (a) imposes 
no restrictions on the way the authority may be exercised, it could be used in conjunction with paragraph (b) so as to enable the 
whole two-thirds authority to be used in connection with a rights issue.  t his accords with guidance issued by the Association 
of British Insurers in December 2008.
t he authority will expire at the earlier of the conclusion of the next annual general meeting of the company and the date falling 
15 months after the passing of this resolution. 
passing this resolution will give the directors flexibility to act in the best interests of shareholders, when opportunities arise, by 
issuing new shares.  t he directors have no present intention of exercising this authority except in connection with the employee 
share schemes of the company.
notice of Annual General Meeting  (continued) Resolution 10 – Adoption of the Performance Share Plan 2010 (the “PSP”) 
o ver the past year, the company has been consulting with its remuneration advisers, Hewitt new Bridge Street, and recently 
with key shareholders on a new share incentive scheme intended for executive directors of the company.  t he Board wishes 
to make long-term incentive awards to executive directors, and as such proposes to adopt the pSp to aid in the retention and 
incentivisation of the executive directors, which is critical to the success of the company.  
A summary of the rules of the pSp is set out in the Appendix to these notes.
A copy of the draft rules of the pSp will be available for inspection as noted on page 107 of this document.
Resolutions 11 and 12 are special resolutions.  These resolutions will be passed if more than 75% of the votes cast for 
or against the resolution are in favour.
Resolution 11 - Disapplication of pre-emption rights 
t he 2006 Act requires that, if the company issues new shares for cash or sells any treasury shares, it must first offer them to 
existing shareholders in proportion to their current holdings.  Shareholders will be asked to allow the directors, within limits, to 
allot equity securities and/or to sell equity securities held “in treasury” (if any) (see below for explanation of equity securities 
held “in treasury”) in the company for cash without application of the pre-emptive rights provided by the 2006 Act up to a 
maximum aggregate nominal value of £33,158, which represents approximately 10 per cent. of the current issued ordinary 
share capital of the company.  t he authority will expire at the same time as the authority to allot shares given under resolution 
9.  t here are no current plans to allot any shares except in connection with the employee share schemes of the company.
Since 1 December 2003, companies have been allowed to purchase their own shares and hold them “in treasury” , rather than 
having to cancel them.  treasury shares carry no right to attend or vote at meetings, or to receive dividends.  nor will the shares 
confer any right to participate pre-emptively in new issues by the company.  It is possible to hold treasury shares for later cash 
sale or for transfer for the purposes of, or pursuant to, an employees’ share scheme, or to cancel them at any time.
t he company does not at present hold any shares in treasury.
Resolution 12 - Authority to purchase own shares 
Resolution 12 is to authorise the company to purchase (in accordance with its articles of association and within recommended 
best practice) its own shares in the market.  t he authority prescribes the maximum and minimum prices to be paid, and, if 
passed, would expire at the same time as the authority to allot shares given under resolution 9.
t he authority would only be exercised if the directors were satisfied that such purchases might be expected to result in an 
increase in earnings per share for the remaining shareholders and were in the best interests of shareholders generally.
Shares purchased under the authority would be treated as cancelled (and the number of shares in issue reduced accordingly) 
or would be held as treasury shares, which may be re-sold, cancelled or transferred for the purposes of an employee share 
scheme.
As at the date of this notice, the company had 33,158,467 shares in issue.  Resolution 12 seeks authority to purchase a 
maximum of 3,315,846 shares, representing approximately 10 per cent. of its current issued share capital.
APPEnDIx
 
Interior Services Group Performance Share Plan 2010 (“PSP”)
Operation 
t he Remuneration committee of the board of directors of the company (the “Remuneration Committee”) will supervise the 
operation of the pSp .
t he pSp will allow the Remuneration committee to allocate a given number of shares in the company (“Shares”) to an eligible 
participant (an “Allocation”).
Eligibility 
Any employee of the company or any subsidiary will be eligible to participate in the pSp at the discretion of the Remuneration 
committee, although it is initially intended that only executive directors of the company will participate.
Timing 
t he Remuneration committee may grant Allocations within 42 days following the company’s announcement of results for any 
period.  t he Remuneration committee may also grant Allocations within 42 days of shareholder approval of the pSp or at any 
other time when the Remuneration committee considers there are circumstances which justify making an Allocation at that 
time.  
109 RepoR t  
AnD FInAncIAL 
St AteMentS 2010
Allocations may not be granted more than ten years after the pSp is adopted.  
Individual participation 
In any financial year, a participant may not normally receive Allocations of Shares which have a market value of more than 
100 per cent. of his salary. However, the Remuneration committee has discretion, in exceptional circumstances, to make 
Allocations over Shares which have a market value of up to 200 per cent. of a participant’s salary.
Overall limit 
t he pSp may operate over newly issued Shares or Shares purchased in the market.
In any ten year period, the company may not issue (or grant rights to issue) more than 10 per cent. of the issued ordinary share 
capital of the company under the pSp and any other employee share plan adopted by the company.  t he use of treasury Shares 
will count as an issue of Shares unless and until institutional guidelines treat them otherwise.
Performance conditions  
participants do not, other than in the circumstances described below, have any rights to receive the Shares in their Allocation 
unless and until, at the end of a restricted period of at least three years, the relevant performance conditions have been 
satisfied.  t hese performance conditions are fixed by the Remuneration committee prior to the Allocation being made and 
communicated to participants at the date of grant of the Allocation.  only upon these performance conditions being satisfied at 
the end of the restricted period do Shares actually become vested in the participant, and the participant becomes the beneficial 
owner of Shares.
For the initial awards, it is intended that 75 per cent. of the Shares will be subject to an earnings per share (“epS”) condition 
and 25 per cent. to a total shareholder return (“tSR”) condition.  t he Remuneration committee will continue to set 
appropriately challenging conditions for subsequent awards, which will be disclosed in the Board’s annual remuneration report.
t he Remuneration committee may vary the performance conditions if an event causes the Remuneration committee to 
consider that it would be appropriate to amend the performance conditions, provided the Remuneration committee considers 
the varied conditions are fair and reasonable and not materially less challenging than the original conditions would have been 
but for the event in question.
Leaving employment 
Following a participant’s death, retirement, termination of employment due to accidental injury, disability or sickness or (at 
the discretion of the Remuneration committee) other special circumstances, participants shall retain their Allocations for 
the remainder of the restricted period on the basis of the performance conditions set on award, unless the Remuneration 
committee (in their discretion) decide to test performance conditions at the date of departure.  In both cases, the number of 
Shares receivable shall be reduced to reflect the fact that the participant has not been employed throughout the restricted 
period, unless the Remuneration committee decides otherwise.  
Corporate events 
Where a change of control of the company occurs during the restricted period, performance conditions will be tested at that 
time and the number of any Shares receivable shall be reduced to reflect the fact that the participant has not held the Allocation 
for the expected three year period, unless the Remuneration committee decides otherwise.     
Where there is a change of control of the company, the acquiring company and the participant may agree that the existing 
Allocation be released in consideration for a new Allocation granted by the acquiring company on such terms as are agreed with 
the acquiring company.  If an internal reorganisation occurs, existing Allocations are automatically exchanged for new Allocations 
granted by the acquiring company.
If a demerger occurs, Allocations will not automatically vest and the extent (if any) to which they vest and the future terms 
of the Allocations (including any voluntary or compulsory exchange of Allocations) will be determined by the Remuneration 
committee.
Variation of share capital 
If a variation of share capital, special dividend or other similar event is proposed, the Remuneration committee may adjust an 
Allocation as it considers appropriate.
Participants’ rights 
An allocation is personal to the participant and may not be transferred, except to his personal representatives on his death.  no 
payment is required for an Allocation.  
Allocations will not confer any shareholder rights until the Allocation has vested and the participant has received his Shares.
notice of Annual General Meeting  (continued) Rights attaching to shares 
Any Shares issued when an Allocation vests will rank equally with Shares then in issue (except for rights arising by reference to 
a record date prior to their allotment).
Alterations to the PSP 
t he Board may amend the pSp at any time in any way which does not affect adversely existing Allocations (majority participant 
approval is required for amendments which are to the disadvantage of participants).  An amendment of the pSp to the 
advantage of participants may not occur without the prior approval of shareholders in general meeting (except for minor 
amendments to take account of a change in legislation or to maintain or obtain favourable tax, exchange control or regulatory 
treatment for any participant, the company or its subsidiaries).
t he Board may terminate the pSp at any time but without prejudice to the terms of outstanding Allocations.
Overseas plans 
t he shareholder resolution to approve the pSp will allow the Board to establish further plans for overseas territories, any such 
plan to be similar to the pSp , but modified to take account of local tax, exchange control or securities laws, provided that any 
shares and awards made available under such further plans are treated as counting against the limits on individual and overall 
participation in the pSp .

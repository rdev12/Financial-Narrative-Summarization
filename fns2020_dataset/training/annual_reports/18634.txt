OL 04 Halladale Group plc | Annual Report & Accounts 2005
It gives me great pleasure to present
another set of excellent results. For
the year to 30 April 2005 Halladale’s
proﬁt before tax was £3.92m, a 50%
increase on last year’s ﬁgure. 
Undiluted earnings per share grew by 4% and triple net asset
value per share, based on the proforma unaudited balance sheet
on page 50, advanced to 90.91p, an increase of 10% over the
previous year. Further information about these calculations is given
in the Financial Review.
Consistent with our progressive dividend policy the Board is
recommending a ﬁnal dividend of 1.9p per share. Taking into
account the interim dividend of 1p per share paid on 25 February
2005 the total dividend of 2.9p per share will be 38% greater
than last year’s. Subject to shareholders’ approval at the Annual
General Meeting the ﬁnal dividend will be paid on 20 September
2005 to shareholders on the register on 22 July 2005, with the
exception of the new shares issued in May of this year pursuant 
to the placing and open offer which will not rank for this year’s
ﬁnal dividend.
Chairman’s statement
Cochrane Square, Glasgow Annual Report & Accounts 2005 | Chairman’s Statement 05
On 16 May 2005 we successfully completed our second major
fund raising of £13.4m, net of expenses, through an issue of new
ordinary shares. This followed the completion in May 2004 of our
ﬁrst major fund raising of just under £15m net of expenses. Both
transactions were enthusiastically supported by the market and, 
as a result, Halladale is in a strengthened position to take further
advantage of market opportunities. 
Co-investment fund management continues to be an important
and growing element of our activities. I am particularly pleased
that during the period, two funds were launched – CReAM with
Citigroup and Halladale Nelson Fund targeted at private investors.
We believe that this area of our activities will become of increasing
importance as the Company grows.
On 10 December 2004 I was delighted to welcome Marcus
Hopkins on to the Board as a non-executive director. Marcus, 
an executive director with Moscow Narodny Bank, has already
made a notable contribution to the Board’s deliberations. Archie
Robertson, who had been a non-executive director of Halladale 
for more than 7 years, stood down from the Board on 31 January
2005. Archie was an outstanding colleague and on behalf of
everyone at Halladale I would like to thank him for his wise
counsel over the years.
We take communication with our shareholders very seriously. 
Our AGM which takes place on 13 September 2005 is an
important opportunity for shareholders to meet the Board and to
ask questions. In addition to the formal business of the AGM our
chief executive, David Lockhart, and our property director, Ken
Lindsay, will give a presentation about the Company’s activities. 
I look forward to welcoming as many of you as possible at this
year’s meeting.
The year under review saw a very high level of activity which 
is described in the Chief Executive’s review and the Operational
Review. As always my thanks are due to my Board colleagues 
and to all the Halladale team whose commitment throughout
another dynamic year has been immense. They are what makes 
a difference and I have every conﬁdence that through their
expertise and dedication Halladale will continue to deliver strong
shareholder returns.

“Co-investment fund management continues 
to be an important and growing element of
our activities... We believe that this area of our
activities will become of increasing importance
as the Company grows.” Market Hall, Carlisle
06 Halladale Group plc | Annual Report & Accounts 2005
This has been another year of
signiﬁcant advance by Halladale 
and, even by comparison with our
previous high levels of activity, it has
been an extremely active year with
considerable growth across all key
areas of our business operations.
Total transactions in the portfolio under management during 
the year more than doubled from £155m in 2004 to £347m and
at 30 April 2005 our total portfolio under management had 
also more than doubled to £450m from £205m a year earlier. 
We co-launched two new co-investment Property Funds and at 
the corporate level we announced our second major fund raising
exercise of £13.4m, net of expenses, which completed just after
the ﬁnancial year end.
We are also delighted to announce another excellent set 
of ﬁnancial results which show strong growth in all our key
performance indicators. The increases in proﬁt before tax and 
total dividend of 50% and 38% respectively justify our rating 
as an asset backed earnings business. Total return on equity 
on a proforma basis was 19.61% for the year (see page 21).
In the UK, property was the top performing asset class in 2004
producing a total return of 18.3%. Most of that performance
came from capital growth fuelled by strong investor demand,
despite limited occupational demand and rising interest rates.
Retail, where the Company is signiﬁcantly invested, was the top
performing sector for the third year in succession. We continue 
to monitor market opportunities and have made a number of
strategic acquisitions in non-retail sectors, notably south east ofﬁces.
Fundraising
On 20 April 2005 we announced our second major fund raising of
£13.4m, net of expenses, through an issue of new ordinary shares,
which successfully completed on 16 May 2005. This followed the
completion of our ﬁrst major fund raising of just under £15m net
of expenses in May 2004.
We have a growing number of core institutional shareholders 
and I would like to take this opportunity to welcome our new
shareholders and also to thank our existing shareholders for their
continued support.
To those investors who acquired shares in Halladale at the time 
of our Admission to AIM in April 2001 and have held them since
then, we have delivered a total annual return of 25.5% in the
period to 30 April 2005, based on the share price at that date and
dividends paid since Admission.
Chief Executive’s review Annual Report & Accounts 2005 | Chief Executive’s Review 07
The combined effect of our two fund raising exercises has
transformed Halladale in two important ways. Firstly, our market
capitalisation has increased from circa £15m fourteen months ago
to over £60m today on a fully diluted basis. This provides us with
greater critical mass and higher recognition within the investing
community. Secondly, the new capital has given us a much
stronger balance sheet, enabling us to increase the size of projects
we can undertake, as well as expand our co-investment activities
and, where appropriate, take larger equity stakes.
The funds raised in 2004 have been put to effective use. We have
more than doubled our co-investment portfolio from £162m to
£388m at 30 April 2005, through our ability to co-invest £9.3m 
of our own equity alongside £64.2m of project equity raised from
our co-investment partners. We were also able to expand our
development programme and increase the value of our directly
owned properties from £43m last year to £62m at the year end.
This demonstrates the effective use to which we have put the
funds raised last year and we intend to do so again with the new
funds raised since the year end.
Business model
Our strategy is to create value through active and entrepreneurial
management, risk controlled development and co-investment 
in commercial property assets and we implement that strategy 
in three key areas:
Asset management – our core strategy, since the Company 
was founded, where we seek to identify opportunities that we can
add value to through our own skills and efforts rather than purely
relying on movement in the markets. At the year end the value 
of properties held for asset management was £295m of which
£249m (84%) was in a number of single investor co-investment
joint ventures with key partners, including Bank of Scotland, Anglo
Irish Private Equity, Citigroup and Kodak Pension Plan. The remaining
£46m (16%) was directly owned on our own balance sheet.
Development – our risk controlled approach to development is
achieved through utilising our own equity to seed development
opportunities through options and conditional contracts. Once 
we have created a viable development scheme with all necessary
consents we decide, having regard to risk and size, whether to
fund it directly on our own balance sheet or through one of our
co-investment joint ventures. Our total development programme,
valued at £65m at 30 April 2005, had an estimated end value 
on completion in excess of £260m of which £75m (29%) is being
funded on our own balance sheet and the remaining £185m
(71%) in co-investment joint ventures.
Co-investment fund management – during the year under
review we co-launched two Property Funds with a total investment
capacity of circa £215m of which £90m had been invested at 
30 April 2005. The ﬁrst was the £185m CReAM Fund co-launched
with Citigroup which will seek to deliver core returns through
investing primarily in the UK retail property sector. The Fund will
have a lifespan of six to eight years. Halladale has a 10% equity 
stake in the Fund and has been appointed as Asset and Property
Manager. Citigroup has a 20% equity stake in the Fund and
underwrote the remaining 70% which is currently being sold
down to both institutional and high net-worth private investors.
The second was the £30m Halladale Nelson Fund and was our 
ﬁrst Property Fund targeted at the private investor market. It is an
income based Fund seeking to deliver a 6.5% annual distribution
to its investors. Nelson is investing in a spread of properties,
principally in the ofﬁce and retail sectors, and has a life span of
seven years. Halladale has invested 9.36% of the equity in the
Fund and has been appointed Asset and Property Manager.
The ability to leverage on our balance sheet, whether through
single investor co-investment joint ventures or multi investor 
co-investment Property Funds, lies at the heart of our co-investment
business model. At 30 April 2005 co-investment activities
accounted for 86% of our total portfolio under management.
Since our Admission to AIM on 27 April 2001 we have raised a
total of £104m of project equity from our co-investment partners
of which £14m has been subsequently repaid. This has enabled us
to grow our total co-investment portfolio from £13.5m at the time
of Admission to £388m at the year end. We believe this is a very
efﬁcient use of our equity which generates a growing recurring fee
income as well as equity and performance related returns.
Prospects
The signiﬁcant growth in capital values in recent years has been
largely driven by investors re-rating property as an asset class
rather than by historical fundamentals such as occupational
demand and rental growth. One consequence of this re-rating is
that property should continue to be an important part of any well
balanced portfolio for the foreseeable future, especially against 
a stable background of low inﬂation and low interest rates.
That re-rating process must at some stage come to an end,
although the precise timing is difﬁcult to call, particularly with
early indications that interest rates may have peaked leading 
to the prospect of lower borrowing costs. When that happens, 
the property investment market should revert to historical
fundamentals where prospects at the macro level will be
inﬂuenced by the performance of the UK economy. It is in this type
of market that the range of asset management and development
skills that we possess becomes essential to maximise income and
create value. One of our strengths is the extensive network of
contacts we have established throughout the UK which continually
enables us to identify opportunities to apply these skills and also
provides us with a strong pipeline of new projects.
Another of our strengths is the quality and commitment of our
management team and I’d like to take this opportunity to thank
them and our professional advisors for their professionalism and
hard work, without which Halladale’s signiﬁcant achievements in
the year under review would not have been possible. We remain
conﬁdent that the combination of our entrepreneurial asset
management and development skills, together with growing 
fee income from our co-investment activities, will enable us to
continue to deliver attractive total returns to our shareholders.

Risk-controlled development
All developments involve an element of risk. The key 
to exploiting opportunities successfully lies in identifying,
managing and controlling those risks from the outset. Annual Report & Accounts 2005 | Halladale Group plc 09
Where opportunities have been identiﬁed to add value to 
an existing property through development, detailed research 
is essential. The initial decision to acquire must be based on 
a real understanding of the factors that could impact on the
development and the realisation of value, including planning 
issues and tenant demand.
In the case of the Bay Tree Centre in Brentwood, acquired in 
co-investment with Bank of Scotland, thorough due diligence gave
a clear indication of how value could be maximised. The leasehold
interest in the property was purchased for £7.25m at a net initial
yield of 5% in 2002, with a development strategy to extend 
and refurbish the existing 70,000 sq. ft. shopping centre and
convert the vacant adjoining ofﬁce tower into residential units. 
Prior to purchase the enthusiastic support of the local council 
in refurbishing the centre, coupled with strong local demand for
quality housing, was carefully established. These factors made 
it extremely likely that a complex planning consent would be 
negotiated and that either the terms of the ground lease would 
be renegotiated or the freehold, owned by the local authority,
could be acquired. Full discussions with local Council ofﬁcials,
tenants and local residents were held to assess the risks involved.
After detailed discussions, terms were agreed to acquire the
freehold interest in the property for £9m and a planning consent
was successfully negotiated. On completion, scheduled later this
year, we will have rejuvenated the tired, open poorly let property
into a 120,000 sq. ft., fully enclosed climatically controlled modern
shopping centre. The anchor supermarket let to Somerﬁeld will
continue in situ alongside new tenants including JJB Sports,
Wilkinsons and Bon Marche. The ofﬁce tower, vacant for ten years,
has been sold to Barratt, since the year end for just over £7m,
along with the consent to refurbish as 106 one and two bed ﬂats,
with adjacent parking. As a result of the retail development it has
been possible to increase the tone of the rents in the adjoining
High Street block, also included in the property purchased, from
£55.00 to £75.00.

The best co-investments are based on compatible cultures 
and mutual understanding. Long-term relationships result in 
quick decision-making and the ﬂexibility to take advantage 
of opportunities in a range of markets.
Our co-investment with Anglo Irish Private Equity is just one
example of how working with the right partners provides
opportunities for Halladale. Sunbury Cross shopping centre was
purchased for £21.35m in January 2005. The mixed-use centre
comprises 57,500 sq. ft. of retail anchored by Marks & Spencer,
Boots and Halfords together with the prominent 56,000 sq. ft.
Chubb Tower ofﬁce block, a multi-storey car park and two
residential tower blocks let on ground leases.
The property contains a range of value enhancement strategies
through active asset management. The combination of 
strategies to maximise returns in this venture will be fully 
explored with Anglo Irish Private Equity and implemented 
at the earliest opportunity.

Our third joint venture with Citigroup involved the purchase of 
a portfolio of primarily retail properties for £32m in June 2002.
Individual strategies for each property had been identiﬁed prior to
purchase. For four of the properties, where identiﬁed opportunities
to add value were minimal, back-to-back sales were agreed for 
a total of £9.3m, generating proﬁt and signiﬁcantly reducing the
initial equity required. Across the remainder of the portfolio, our
range of asset management strategies included undertaking rent
reviews, negotiating longer term leases from existing tenants, and
re-letting units on imminent lease expiries.
Flexibility and adaptability is critical to asset management. To take
advantage of increasing demand for well-let retail properties,
several sales were achieved in 2003 and 2004 ahead of the initial
business plan both in terms of timing and sales value. 
In June 2005 the ﬁnal property in the portfolio was sold providing
total returns to all shareholders in the venture at over 56%, higher
than the base business plan produced on initial acquisition. Weybridge, Surrey

Market comment 
The total portfolio under management more than doubled over
the year, from £205m to £450m. Activity in the ofﬁce sector has
increased and current weightings across the portfolio are:
Shopping centres 62%
In-town retail 15%
Ofﬁces 12%
Out of town retail 8%
Industrial 3%
As shown in Table 1, the main element of market performance
during the calendar year 2004 has been strong demand from
investors and a resultant increase in capital growth.
Property was the top performing asset class in 2004 and has 
now out-performed equities and gilts over one, three, ﬁve and ten
years. The prospects for 2005 show little sign of change with
further improvement in capital values and limited signs of rental
growth. Looking forward, we consider it likely that further capital
growth will be limited and believe that future performance will
depend on creating value through implementing successful asset
management and development strategies.

Transactions in the year
The year was particularly active in the portfolio under
management with total acquisitions of £256.2m (2004 – £98.7m),
and total disposals of £91.1m (2004 – £55.9m).
Despite signiﬁcant competition in the market place we acquired
interesting opportunities across all three key areas of our
operations through our extensive network of contacts throughout
the UK. Acquisitions included ﬁve shopping centres for £122m,
two retail portfolios for £62m, three ofﬁces for £34m, two
development opportunities for £12m and the freehold interest in
the Baytree Shopping Centre in Brentwood for £9m. The balance
of £17m comprised a number of directly owned retail properties.
We brought several asset management strategies to a successful
completion during the year, through the disposal of the properties
involved. We also took advantage of strong investor demand 
to effect disposals of some assets earlier than originally planned. 
The main disposals in the year included three shopping centres for
£28m and a retail warehouse for £23m. We sold £17m of mainly
retail assets to the Halladale Nelson Limited Partnership, and
disposed of our ﬁnal interest at the development in Queen Street,
Glasgow for £2m. The balance of £21m mainly comprised the
disposal of smaller retail properties.
Asset management
At 30 April 2005 the value of properties held for asset
management totalled £295m of which £249m (84%) was in 
co-investments. Major activities for the year are listed below:
Co-investment with Bank of Scotland
The Brook Retail Portfolio, acquired for £44.25m, comprises 
a wide variety of retail properties throughout the UK, providing
opportunities to apply our asset management skills. Several
properties have been disposed of to date, taking advantage 
of the strong investment market in line with the business plan. 
In addition, planning applications are being pursued for the
portfolio’s properties in Bury St Edmonds, Newbury and Tunbridge
Wells, where opportunities have been identiﬁed for redevelopment
and change of use strategies. 73-75 The Strand, acquired for
£13m, comprises ofﬁce space of 18,000 sq. ft. let to Shell UK
Limited and two substantial retail units at ground ﬂoor level.
Strategies include possible regearing of a leasehold interest 
in one of the retail units.

Acquisitions 16 Halladale Group plc | Annual Report & Accounts 2005
Co-investments with Citigroup
The CReAM fund, referred to in the Chief Executive’s Review,
acquired three shopping centres: Angel Place Shopping Centre,
Bridgwater for £16.25m, Market Walk Shopping Centre, 
Newton Abbot for £18.85m, and Grays Shopping Centre in Essex
for £32.1m. We believe all these centres will provide good
opportunities to apply our asset management skills to add value
over the life of the fund.
The Group’s third co-investment vehicle with Citigroup completed
its disposal program following successful implementation of its
asset enhancement strategies. The ﬁnal property in this portfolio,
was sold for £1.42m after the year-end. The shopping centre in
Daventry, also held in a Citigroup co-investment was, following
completion of the partial redevelopment and increases in the rent
roll, also sold after the year-end for £22m. 
Co-investment with Anglo Irish Private Equity
Queens Square Shopping Centre, acquired for £18.5m, is the
principal shopping centre in West Bromwich and extends to
225,000 sq. ft. The potential redevelopment of the centre will 
be fully explored in the medium term. Sunbury Cross Shopping
Centre in Sunbury-on-Thames, acquired for £21.35m, is a mixed-
use property located adjacent to junction 1 of the M3. It comprises
retail space of 57,500 sq. ft. and the Chubb ofﬁce tower which 
is a 12-storey ofﬁce building of 56,000 sq. ft. offering potential
opportunities for development when the current lease expires. 
The Queens Street Shopping Centre in Darlington, acquired for
£28.6m, extends to 75,000 sq. ft. The property is immediately
adjacent to a proposed town centre extension site that will
facilitate the development of a major new shopping facility.
Co-investment with Kodak Pension Plan
Beckett House, Cheapside, London, acquired for £14.65m, 
is a mixed-use leasehold property, within close proximity to the
Bank of England, and with planning consent for 120,000 sq. ft. 
of retail space and Grade A ofﬁces. There are opportunities to
enhance value through a variety of asset management strategies
including combining the leasehold and freehold interests, as well 
as implementing the planning consent. The 130,000 sq. ft. 
Big W unit in Stockton, let on a long lease to a good covenant,
was sold into the strong investment market some 2 years ahead 
of budget for £23.25m. At MVA House, Woking, a complex
refurbishment programme was completed with the existing tenant
in situ. As part of the agreement to refurbish, a new long-term
lease was signed with the tenant and the property was sold 
for £2.72m.
Co-investment with Private Client of Kleinwort Benson
The two shopping centres held in the co-investment were sold in
the year: Market Hall, Carlisle, sold for £7.46m, and Market Walk
Shopping Centre, Newton Abbot, sold for £18.85m, following 
the successful completion of various asset management strategies
including a substantial reletting programme at Newton Abbot
where the majority of the leases expired in December 2004. 
Directly owned
The Larrick Portfolio, acquired for £15.85m, comprises seven town
centre retail properties throughout the UK, and a retail warehouse
in Blackpool. Two of the properties, in Blackpool and Brighton,
have been sold this year in advance of business plan in timing and

sales value. Wellington Road, Aberdeen acquired for £4.45m, and
St Mary’s Gate, Shefﬁeld acquired for £7.4m, are retail warehouse
properties with potential to increase rental income at forthcoming
rent reviews. We took advantage of opportunities in the ofﬁce
market with the acquisition for £4.8m of Shaftesbury House,
Glasgow, comprising ofﬁces and retail with short-term income and
an exciting development opportunity adjacent to Central Station.
After the year end the Group also acquired, for £8.05m, a 
15,000 sq. ft. ofﬁce at Moorgate, London, let for a further six years.
Development
Our risk-controlled development programme continues to grow
and at the year end had an estimated value on completion in
excess of £260m spread over 11 projects in the group and 
co-investments. These include:
Baytree Shopping Centre, Brentwood
The freehold interest of the Baytree Shopping Centre was 
acquired from Brentwood Council, for £9m, following the grant 
of planning permission. Construction is now well advanced for 
the refurbishment and extension of the shopping centre with
completion scheduled for later this year. Major pre-lets have been
secured with JJB Sports and Wilkinsons and various lettings are
proceeding through legals with major national multiples. Planning
consent was achieved to convert the vacant ofﬁce tower above
the centre into 106 one and two bedroom ﬂats and, since the year
end, this part of the property has been sold to Barratts for £7.1m.
Cochrane Square, Glasgow
At Cochrane Square, in Glasgow’s Merchant City, building works
are now well advanced on the mixed-use development of 84 one
and two bedroom ﬂats with underground car parking and four
retail/restaurant units. The project is scheduled for completion in
Spring 2006.
Newport, Isle of Wight
The Group purchased the bus station in Newport for just over 
£5m having gained planning consent to develop 60,000 sq. ft. of
new retail space together with a new bus interchange. Preliminary
works have now commenced on-site with a view to completion in
the summer of 2006. Pre-lets of three out of the four large units
have been achieved. The site also includes a building let to
Secretary of State for the Environment until March 2006 and
strategies to maximise value are being advanced.
OKI site, Cumbernauld
This 65 acre site was purchased in our ﬁrst co-investment with 
The Carlyle Group and comprises a new production facility of
200,000 sq. ft. currently being constructed and which OKI will
occupy under a new lease. The site also has planning consent for
over 300,000 sq. ft. of bulky goods retail warehousing. The new
facility for OKI should complete in August 2005 and the next
phase will involve the construction of the retail warehouse park
where discussions are well advanced with the anchor tenant.
Other developments
There are a number of properties, both directly-owned and in 
co-investments, where a development strategy is being pursued.
This includes refurbishment of the shopping centre at Bingley, 
the potential redevelopment of Shaftesbury House, Glasgow to
provide high quality new ofﬁce space with retail at ground ﬂoor,
and the extension and refurbishment of the shopping centre in
West Bromwich.
Through our extensive network of contacts we continue to receive
a strong ﬂow of potential development opportunities across 
all sectors. 
Future activities
The portfolio under management at 30 April 2005 comprised 
64 properties (2004 – 45 properties), and an average lot size of
£7.03m (2004 – £4.55m). The new funds raised will enable us 
to continue to increase the average lot size, providing greater
economies of scale. 
Whilst retail properties, including shopping centres, continue to
form a major part of the total portfolio, we are increasingly taking
advantage of opportunities in the ofﬁce market, notably in the
South East, where we recently announced the acquisition of well
located properties on The Strand and Cheapside in central London
and the post year-end acquisition of an ofﬁce in Moorgate, London.
Our retail portfolio comprises retailers selling mainly convenience
goods, as opposed to luxury goods, and we consider that this, 
as well as our strategy of careful stock selection, will underpin 
the value of the portfolio’s retail assets. We continue to identify
shopping centres, let at modest rental levels, which have seen little
asset management over the years and which therefore offer good
opportunities to increase values and generate proﬁt through our
asset management and development skills.
Our development programme has grown signiﬁcantly through 
our ability to identify opportunities across all sectors where we can
apply our skills through the planning and project management
process to generate a growing proﬁt stream. Whilst the investment
market has had a strong run, growth in occupational demand 
and rental levels has, on average, been much more modest. 
With limited supply in certain sectors now emerging, this provides
a stable background for our development activities.
Careful stock selection, together with a strong asset management
and development skill base, will be the key to out-performance 
at this stage in the cycle. At Halladale we have a proven track
record in both areas and, as such, are conﬁdent that we can
continue to create signiﬁcant value for our co-investment partners
and shareholders.

Financial performance
During the year under review the Group has continued to 
expand all its activities, particularly through co-investment vehicles.
The activities of these vehicles are, under accounting standards,
shown as a share of operating proﬁt only which makes it difﬁcult to 
convey the scale of operations and the gross value of transactions
within these vehicles. Tables 1 and 2 on pages 19 and 20 provide
an analysis of the Group’s activities.
Total revenue received by co-investments and from directly-owned
properties was £114m (2004 – £69m).
No allocation of overhead has been made between co-investment
and directly-owned activities.

A total of £459,000 of proﬁts and fees, which have been received
in the year, has been deferred to future years in accordance with
accounting principles. Of total fees received from co-investments
in the year, the sum of £245,000 has been deferred as the 
co-investment entity has capitalised that fee as part of its cost 
of acquisition. Proﬁts from property sales of £214,000 have been
deferred where properties have been sold from entities within 
the Group to co-investment vehicles. The deferral is calculated 
by reference to the Group’s equity share in the purchasing 
co-investment vehicle.
Undiluted earnings per share has increased in the year after
allowing for the issue of 8,374,056 new shares in May 2004.

statements for the year ended 30 April 2005.
1. Activities and future prospects
The principal activities of the Group are trading, asset
management and development of property located throughout
the UK both on its own account and in co-investment vehicles. 
A full review of the Group’s business and results for the year is
contained in the Chairman’s Statement, Chief Executive’s Review,
Operational Review and Financial Review, which should be read in
conjunction with this report.
2. Results and dividends
The Group proﬁt for the year after taxation amounted to
£2,864,000. An interim dividend of 1p per share, amounting to
£275,000, was paid in February 2005 and it is proposed that a
ﬁnal dividend of 1.9p per share, amounting to £523,000, be paid
in September 2005. This leaves a surplus of £2,066,000 to be
transferred to reserves.
3. Share capital
During the year the Company issued 8,374,056 new ordinary
shares of 25p each at a price of 70p per share as a share placing
and 35,000 new ordinary shares of 25p each at a price of 59p per

during the following ﬁve years, shares equal to up to 10% of 
the issued share capital, otherwise than on a pre-emptive basis.
6. Corporate governance
While the Combined Code issued by the Financial Reporting
Council does not apply to AIM companies, the directors consider
corporate governance to be an important area and accordingly
have provided the disclosure below to outline how the governance
of the Group is conducted.
Internal control
The directors have reviewed the effectiveness of the system of
internal control, the key elements of which are as follows:
• Board procedures to establish the parameters within which
management operate.
• The measurement of Group ﬁnancial performance on a monthly
basis against budget. On a quarterly basis this reporting 
is formalised within a report circulated to and considered 
by the Board.
• A system of authorisation and approval of expenditure,
together with relevant cheque signatory limits. 
• Detailed diligence is undertaken on each new property
acquisition including those in co-investments, comprising
agency advice, legal opinions and survey reports together with
a detailed business plan to conﬁrm viability. Each business plan
is regularly reviewed to factor-in actual performance and any
necessary amendments to assumptions.
• Careful consideration, including advice on legal, accounting
and tax implications, is given to each new vehicle established.
This includes a review of the level of the Company’s control
over future activities of the relevant vehicle, as well as a
risk/reward analysis to determine the potential proﬁtability of
each acquisition.
Directors’ responsibilities
Details of the composition of the Board are disclosed in this report.
Board meetings are held on average every two months, where 
a formal schedule of matters including, inter alia , overall strategy
and monitoring of ﬁnancial performance, is discussed.
The two undernoted committees, minutes of which are circulated
and reviewed by the directors, have operated throughout the year.
Audit Committee
The Audit Committee comprises the three non-executive directors
who have a remit to meet at least twice a year to monitor the
Group’s ﬁnancial reporting and accounting policies and the
adequacy of internal ﬁnancial controls. The Committee also
reviews interim reports, preliminary announcements and the
Annual Report and Accounts prior to their submission to the Board.
Remuneration Committee
The Remuneration Committee comprises the three non-executive
directors and meets at least once a year to determine the
remuneration and terms and conditions of employment of the
executive directors of the Company. In particular the Remuneration
Committee sets the level of discretionary bonus payments to each
of the directors. The total sum paid in bonus to the executive directors
for the year to 30 April 2005 was £975,000 (2004 – £750,000).
Additionally, the full Board acts as the Nomination Committee to
consider, when necessary, the appointment of any new directors or
company secretary.
Going concern
After making due enquiry, the directors are of the opinion that at
the time of approving the accounts, taking into account available
bank facilities, the Company and Group has adequate resources 
to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future. 
The accounts have therefore been prepared on the going concern basis.

Statement of directors’ responsibilities
United Kingdom company law requires the directors to prepare
ﬁnancial statements for each ﬁnancial period which give a true
and fair view of the state of affairs of the Company and Group 
at the end of that ﬁnancial period and of the proﬁt or loss of the
Group for that period. In preparing those ﬁnancial statements, 
the directors are required to:
• select suitable accounting policies and then apply 
them consistently;
• make judgements and estimates that are reasonable and
prudent; and
• state whether applicable accounting standards have been
followed subject to any material departures disclosed and
explained in the ﬁnancial statements.
The directors are responsible for keeping proper accounting
records which disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the
ﬁnancial position of the Company and to enable them to ensure
that the ﬁnancial statements comply with the Companies Act
1985. They are also responsible for safeguarding the assets of the
Company and Group and hence for taking reasonable steps for
the prevention and detection of fraud and other irregularities. Annual Report & Accounts 2005 | Halladale Group plc 29
Independent auditors’ report to the 
members of Halladale Group plc
We have audited the ﬁnancial statements of Halladale Group plc
for the year ended 30 April 2005 which comprise the consolidated
proﬁt and loss account, the consolidated reconciliation of
movements in shareholders’ funds, the statements of movements
in reserves, the balance sheets, the consolidated cash ﬂow
statement and notes thereto, and the related notes 1 to 23. These
ﬁnancial statements have been prepared under the accounting
policies set out therein.
This report is made solely to the company’s members, as a body, 
in accordance with section 235 of the Companies Act 1985. 
Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might state to
the company’s members those matters we are required to state 
to them in an auditors’ report and for no other purpose. To the
fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume
responsibility to anyone other than the company and the
company’s members as a body, for our audit work, for this report,
or for the opinions we have formed.
Respective responsibilities of directors and auditors
As described in the statement of directors’ responsibilities, 
the company’s directors are responsible for the preparation of 
the ﬁnancial statements in accordance with applicable United
Kingdom law and accounting standards. They are also responsible
for the preparation of the other information contained in 
the annual report. Our responsibility is to audit the ﬁnancial
statements in accordance with relevant United Kingdom legal 
and regulatory requirements and auditing standards.
We report to you our opinion as to whether the ﬁnancial
statements give a true and fair view and are properly prepared 
in accordance with the Companies Act 1985. We also report 
to you if, in our opinion, the directors’ report is not consistent
with the ﬁnancial statements, if the company has not kept proper
accounting records, if we have not received all the information
and explanations we require for our audit, or if information
speciﬁed by law regarding directors’ remuneration and
transactions with the company and other members of the group 
is not disclosed.
We read the directors’ report and the other information contained
in the annual report for the above year as described in the
contents section and consider the implications for our report 
if we become aware of any apparent misstatements or material
inconsistencies with the ﬁnancial statements.
Basis of audit opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with United Kingdom
auditing standards issued by the Auditing Practices Board. 
An audit includes examination, on a test basis, of evidence relevant
to the amounts and disclosures in the ﬁnancial statements. 
It also includes an assessment of the signiﬁcant estimates and
judgements made by the directors in the preparation of the
ﬁnancial statements and of whether the accounting policies are
appropriate to the circumstances of the company and the group,
consistently applied and adequately disclosed.
We planned and performed our audit so as to obtain all the
information and explanations which we considered necessary 
in order to provide us with sufﬁcient evidence to give reasonable
assurance that the ﬁnancial statements are free from material
misstatement, whether caused by fraud or other irregularity 
or error. In forming our opinion, we also evaluated the overall
adequacy of the presentation of information in the ﬁnancial
statements.
Opinion
In our opinion the ﬁnancial statements give a true and fair view 
of the state of affairs of the company and the group as at 30 April
2005 and of the proﬁt of the group for the year then ended and
have been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies
Act 1985.

Notes: An audit does not provide assurance on the maintenance
and integrity of the website, including controls used to achieve
this, and in particular on whether any changes may have occurred
to the ﬁnancial statements since ﬁrst published. These matters are
the responsibility of the directors but no control procedures can
provide absolute assurance in this area.
Legislation in the United Kingdom governing the preparation and
dissemination of ﬁnancial statements differs from legislation in
other jurisdictions. 30 Halladale Group plc |  Annual Report & Accounts 2005

Notes to the financial statements
Year ended 30 April 2005
1. Accounting policies
The ﬁnancial statements are prepared in accordance with
applicable United Kingdom accounting standards. The particular
accounting policies adopted by the directors, which have remained
unchanged from the previous year, are described below.
(a) Accounting convention
These ﬁnancial statements have been prepared under the historical
cost convention and in accordance with all applicable accounting
standards. 
(b) Basis of consolidation
The Group ﬁnancial statements consolidate the ﬁnancial
statements of the Company and its subsidiaries for the year ended
30 April 2005 (Note 9). The results of subsidiaries acquired are
consolidated for the period from the date on which control
passed. Acquisitions are accounted for under the acquisition
method. No proﬁt and loss account is presented for Halladale
Group plc as provided by S230 of the Companies Act 1985. 
(c) Joint ventures and associates
The results of joint ventures and associates are consolidated using
the equity method of accounting. The consolidated proﬁt and loss
account includes the Group’s share of associates’ and joint
ventures’ proﬁts, while the Group’s share of the net assets of joint
ventures and associates is shown in the consolidated balance
sheet. The Group is entitled to incentivised returns on reaching
pre-established hurdles, mainly set by reference to overall returns,
in certain projects being undertaken by associates. This incentivised
return is only recognised by the Group once it is earned, normally
on the receipt of a distribution at the incentivised return rate.
(d) Income recognition
Turnover is recognised on the sale of properties held for resale or
development at the date of unconditional completion of the
contract. Other income, including rental income and management
fees, is recognised in the period to which it relates.
(e) Tangible ﬁxed assets
Depreciation is provided on all tangible ﬁxed assets at rates
calculated to write off the cost in equal instalments over their
estimated useful lives. The rates of depreciation are as follows:
Furniture and equipment 15% straight line
Computer equipment 25% straight line
Motor vehicles 25% straight line
(f) Investments
Investments in subsidiary companies are stated at cost less
provision for impairment. Other investments are stated at cost less
provision for diminution in value.
(g) Stocks
Properties held for re-sale or development are valued at the lower
of cost and net realisable value. Cost includes capitalised interest
where relevant. Net realisable value represents the estimated sales
price less costs estimated to be incurred up to the date of disposal.
(h) Interest capitalisation
For properties in the course of development, interest is capitalised
in stocks up until the date of Practical Completion. From that date,
interest is charged against proﬁt.
(i) Current tax
Current tax, including UK corporation tax is provided at amounts
expected to be paid (or recovered) using the tax rates and laws
that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance
sheet date.
(j) Deferred taxation
In accordance with FRS 19, deferred tax is provided in full on
timing differences which result in an obligation at the balance
sheet date to pay more tax, or a right to pay less tax, at a future
date, at rates expected to apply when they crystallise based on
current tax rates and law. Timing differences arise from the
inclusion of items of income and expenditure in taxation
computations in periods different from those in which they are
included in ﬁnancial statements. Deferred tax assets are recognised
to the extent that it is regarded as more likely than not that 
they will be recovered. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are 
not discounted.
(k) Hire purchase
Assets held under hire purchase agreements and the related
obligations are recorded in the balance sheet at the fair value of
the assets at the inception of the agreements. The excess of the
payments over the recorded obligations are treated as ﬁnance
charges which are charged to the proﬁt and loss account as
incurred. Rental costs under operating leases are charged to the
proﬁt and loss account in equal annual amounts over the periods
of the leases.
(l) Goodwill
Goodwill is capitalised in the year in which it arises and amortised
over its estimated useful life. The directors regard 10 years as a
reasonable maximum for the estimated useful life of existing
goodwill. Capitalised goodwill on a fair value basis relating to joint
ventures is included within the carrying value of the joint venture.
(m) Debt
Debt is initially stated at the amount of the net proceeds after the
deduction of issue costs. The carrying amount is increased by the
ﬁnance cost in respect of the accounting period and reduced by
payments made. Convertible debt is reported as a liability unless,
and until, conversion actually occurs. Annual Report & Accounts 2005  |  Halladale Group plc 37

16. Financial assets and liabilities
The Group holds ﬁnancial instruments only to manage the interest rate risk arising from its borrowings. As all transactions are undertaken
in sterling and within the UK, there is no perceived currency risk. No speculative transactions are permitted.
The Group’s borrowings, other than one loan of £1,500,000 (2004 – £1,750,000) and the CULS (note 15), are wholly in relation to and
secured by properties held as stock. Accordingly a relatively short term view is required to be considered when reviewing the interest rate
risk. This risk is managed by securing a mixture of ﬁxed and ﬂoating rate debt and by the use of interest rate swaps. The actual balance
of these measures is determined by the nature of the asset to which the borrowing relates and is established and reviewed in consultation
with the relevant lender.
The Group has deﬁned ﬁnancial assets and liabilities as those of a ﬁnancial nature, being cash and borrowings. Short term debtors and
creditors, taxation and prepayments and accruals are not considered.

Overview
Our global operations
Kentz has over 14,000 employees and 
operations in 29 countries around the 
world, including the Americas, the Middle 
East, Africa, Australasia, the Far East, 
Russia and Europe. Kentz has been operating 
internationally on some of the largest oil and gas 
and minerals resourcing projects in the world for 
over 30 years, but it is our 90 year history that 
has laid the foundations for success.
People are the greatest resource at Kentz and we value the loyalty  
of our employees and are committed to the long-term internal 
development of our staff. On average the top 100 management  
each has over 17 years of service with the Group. Kentz has a strong 
partnering culture and has a number of agreements across our 
regions including Russia, the Caribbean, the Middle East  
and Australia. 
Kentz continues to grow its addressable market through ongoing 
geographic expansion, new service offerings and an expanded  
client base.
World class 
offering
Americas
Kentz has been operating in the United States since 
1995 and is currently working on five projects for 
ExxonMobil in the region. In Canada, Kentz is 
involved in the significant Kearl Oil Sands resource 
and energy project. The backlog of work in the 
Americas has risen 50% during 2011 and Kentz  
sees substantial opportunities in this region.
Africa
Southern Africa continues to be a large area of 
operation for the Group. Kentz has seen a significant 
increase in its metals and mining business in remote 
parts of Africa, which it expects to continue in the 
long-term. Revenues for the full year 2011 were up 
over 100% and the pipeline of prospects has grown 
by a similar percentage.  WWW.KENTZ.COM KENTZ CORPORATION LTD ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2011

Middle East and Caspian
The Middle East remains a significant area of 
operation for Kentz. It is showing signs of significant 
future expansion with new projects being developed 
by both national and international oil companies, 
especially in Iraq, the United Arab Emirates and 
Saudi Arabia for oil and gas production, 
petrochemical and refining industries. 
Australasia
In Australia, Kentz continues to see considerable 
ongoing investment in liquefied natural gas (LNG), 
liquefaction to take place in the Pacific Rim over the 
mid to longer term. Several LNG processing facilities 
are either under development or in implementation, 
all of which are significant in size and complexity. 
Kentz’s backlog in Australasia increased by 
approximately 250% during the year 2011.
Far East, Russia and Europe
Kentz’s backlog of work in Russia is up 100% on 
2010 and it sees substantial opportunities in this 
region. In Russia the recent opening up of reserves 
for the participation of international oil companies 
should benefit Kentz. It has a strong track record of 
working in Far East Russia, and has two joint venture 
partnerships with Russian companies that have 
been in place for a number of years now; DEM and 
SMNM (a Rosneft owned company). In the last 
number of years, Kentz has achieved significant 
growth in more remote and challenging locations. 
However, it still continues to service smaller projects 
from time to time in Europe. WWW.KENTZ.COM 1 KENTZ CORPORATION LTD ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2011

Overview
Chairman’s statement
World class 
performance
Kentz delivered another impressive 
performance in 201 1, with growth in 
order intake, sales and earnings 
finishing ahead of expectations.
Kentz delivered another impressive performance in 
2011, with growth in order intake, sales and earnings 
finishing ahead of expectations. In many ways the 
year represented a significant turning point for the 
Company; not least with our graduation to the Main 
Market of the London Stock Exchange. 
While Company values of Safety, Teamwork and 
Reputation remain at the foundation of our business, 
we are facing new challenges all the time through the 
rapidly shifting landscape of the industry, economic 
and regulatory environment. 
The global energy and resources conditions for  
new project development during 2011 continued to 
be focused on more remote and emerging areas. 
The safety track record that Kentz has built over 
time is central to our operations worldwide and focus 
on this is more important than ever when entering 
new areas. The Board takes its responsibility for the 
safety and welfare of employees very seriously and 
undertakes regular reviews on processes and 
performance. The Company’s third annual Safety 
Conference in March 2011 provided an opportunity 
to bring together people from around the global 
operations, as well as partners and clients to review 
and refine procedures. 
Strong and sustainable relationships with our clients 
hinge on our reputation for delivery and alignment 
with their values. Kentz continues to strengthen its 
relationships with key clients through the introduction 
of client account management plans. These now 
provide personalised focus for our key customers 
where a significant majority of recurring revenues 
occur. This has allowed us, going into 2012, to 
commit greater energy into new client development 
in the sectors we service and increase our 
addressable market.
Whilst energy associated stocks were hit during 2011 
by a number of credit rating agency downgrades and 
ongoing European debt concerns, the longer-term 
outlook for the energy and resources services 
sectors remains robust. The management team 
believes the Company’s outlook is very positive and 
continues to see the benefits of a global approach  
to servicing clients across the sectors in which  
we operate. During the year we have strengthened 
our senior management and their teams, through 
recruitment and training and development, in order 
to meet the demands of future opportunities  
for Kentz.  WWW.KENTZ.COM 9 KENTZ CORPORATION LTD ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2011
In line with the significant achievements of the 
past year, the Board has stepped up to embrace 
new guidance on risk, Board leadership and 
effectiveness, executive remuneration and 
accountability. These have been set out within our 
Annual Report and Accounts through our Committee 
Reports. These Committees have provided direction 
and control over the growth of the Company’s 
business and ensured that we are complying with 
all relevant processes, customs, policies, laws, and 
institutions. I welcome an open and honest dialogue 
with all our shareholders and members of the Board 
have made themselves available to meet with 
shareholders on request. 
Lastly, as you will be aware, following the year end 
it was announced that Christian Brown succeeded 
Hugh O’Donnell as Chief Executive of the Company. 
On behalf of the Board and everyone at Kentz,  
I would like to pay tribute to Hugh for his huge 
contribution to the Company throughout his 12-year 
tenure. I personally have enjoyed working with 
Hugh enormously and we have all benefited from 
his leadership, experience and wisdom. We are 
delighted that Hugh has committed to a further three 
years with Kentz through his exclusive advisory 
arrangements. It is fantastic for us that his time will 
be spent on key client relationships and securing 
new business. 
We very much look forward to working with Christian 
and his management team in the coming months  
and years and feel confident that the outlook for  
the business and for our shareholders remains 
extremely positive.

Risk
This international presence exposes 
Kentz to a wide range of legal and 
regulatory systems, trade policies, 
the challenges associated with 
management and co-ordination 
across a wide geographical spread 
and a degree of political instability in 
a small number of locations. 
Kentz derives the majority of its 
business on the basis of substantial 
contracts which are won through 
competitive tender processes and 
it therefore operates on a project-
by-project basis, and its visible 
order book can fluctuate from time 
to time.
Achievements
Presence in 29 countries worldwide. 
Entered into three new countries of 
operation in 2011 : Jordan, Singapore 
and South Korea.

Long-term client 
relationships
Rapid growth Partnerships and 
developing successful  
joint ventures (JVs)
Kentz has a small number of 
clients that account for a significant 
proportion of its revenue. A failure to 
deliver consistently high standards 
of projects and Health and Safety 
performance could impact on 
the ability of the Group to secure 
ongoing business. 
Kentz may be unable to attract 
and retain sufficient skilled 
personnel to meet its operational 
requirements. Kentz depends on 
the continued service of senior 
personnel, including its Directors 
and senior management. 
The Group has a certain amount 
of reliance on its Joint Venture (JV) 
partners; the success of these

Chief Executive’s review
201 1 marked another period of 
transition for Kentz; as we graduated  
to the Main Market of the London Stock 
Exchange three years after our initial 
public offering on AIM. 
Margin enhancing 
opportunities
2011 marked another period of transition for Kentz; 
as we graduated to the Main Market of the London 
Stock Exchange three years after our initial public 
offering on AIM. I believe there will be benefits to  
the move; greater interest in our story, a wider 
shareholder base and ranking among our peers. 
More importantly, having delivered another 30% 
growth in revenues and a 50% rise in our work on 
hand during the year, the move to the FTSE 250 is 
the right platform for the Company we believe Kentz 
can become. During 2011 we achieved a record 
backlog of US$2.4 billion that gives us greater 
visibility of earnings, and supports our investment in 
building out our capability and resources. This 
investment is key to our sustainable and profitable 
growth which we believe will continue in line with  
market expectations.
Our approach to achieving critical mass and growth 
across our three Global Business Units, underpinned 
by moving up the value chain to grow margin and 
earnings remains as the key element of Kentz 
strategy. We will continue to review acquisition 
opportunities in support of this strategy.
The last year proved yet again why our core historical 
Construction capabilities are central to the Kentz 
growth model. Kentz has been delivering multi-
discipline construction services globally for over  
30 years. Performance on tough and remote jobs  
is what has shaped our reputation and opened the 
door to provide other, higher-value, service offerings 
to our clients. 
 Æ Page 34 for further details on Construction
Delivering our own, direct-hire, construction labour 
means we are in control of our field execution 
activities and can better manage and control safety, 
execution and risk. This capability allows us to 
successfully deliver world class performance in such 
places as Far-East Russia, Papua New Guinea or 
Sub-Saharan Africa. Consistent delivery of such 
world class mega projects for major international 
clients was the key ingredient in our ability to win  
the Gorgon MEI US$2.3 billion reimbursable 
construction project which is being developed  
by three of the world’s largest oil companies. WWW.KENTZ.COM 19 KENTZ CORPORATION LTD ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2011

Oil, gas and petrochemical projects have 
consistently made up around 75% of our work,  
but 2011 saw a marked jump in mining and  
metals work that exemplifies the Kentz model of 
development. Over the years we have delivered a 
number of Construction scopes of work with major 
mineral resource clients in Southern Africa. Now as 
they seek out new projects and need more remote 
services Kentz is ideally placed to support them,  
with a complementary global footprint and services 
that sit across the lifecycle of their projects; from 
front-end engineering design, through provision  
of early infrastructure, construction services, 
completion and commissioning and into the 
operating phase. 
 Æ Page 24 for Client Project Lifecycle
2011 proved an uncertain year in terms of the global 
economy, but all the signs point to buoyant and 
sustained capital expenditure on the development of 
resources. I see huge potential still for Kentz; in the 
provision of more services to new and existing clients 
as well as in new geographies and sectors. The 
diversification of Kentz business from a value chain, 
end market and geographical standpoint affords 
Kentz the opportunity to grow further by increasing 
our addressable market. 
Kentz’s revenues were historically derived 90% from 
a client’s capital expenditure (in the development of 
new facilities) and only 10% from operational 
expenditure (delivering services on existing facilities). 
While we had all the requisite expertise in Asset 
Enhancement Services (AES) – maintenance and 
shutdown, brownfield engineering, and operations 
support – targeting specific opportunities with clients 
has reaped rewards in the past year with the award 
of five long-term brownfield engineering service 
contracts in the Middle East alone. Our strategy is to 
capitalise on the opportunities available in this 
business line through wider geographic expansion. 
During 2011 the capacity of our Development group 
has been increased to commit greater resources into 
new client development in the sectors we service to 
further expand our addressable market. 
business review WWW.KENTZ.COM 20 KENTZ CORPORATION LTD ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2011
Business review
Chief Executive’s review continued
Process EPC, or the delivery of onshore modular 
production facilities, is a further niche area where 
Kentz can differentiate its offering to our core clients 
as part of the continuing development of our 
business. Our target market is production facilities 
for the onshore oil and gas sector and in particular, 
upstream oil and gas process facilities including all 
the associated site infrastructure, process and 
non-process utilities, and off-sites. For international 
oil companies the modularisation of early and central 
production facilities is key to the economic viability  
of their field development plans; in achieving 
revenues sooner on modest production levels, 
conducting more in-depth field analysis via test-train 
facilities, and in many cases, maintaining the licence 
ownership for an area of operation that may not  
be first in line for full production development.  
The opportunity to provide oil and gas production 
facilities to clients is underpinned by Kentz’s proven 
success in the delivery of projects, often in logistically 
challenging locations, and it capitalises on reputable 
in-house engineering, procurement, modular 
fabrication and construction. 
Part of our stated strategy for completing the public 
listing in 2008 was to raise new funds to complete  
an acquisition in the Process EPC space. At the time 
we took a twin track approach; both identifying

visibility of Future Work
During 201 1, the total order 
intake converted to backlog  
was up almost 80% to US$2.26 
billion, providing very good 
visibility of future work through  
to 2015.
potential acquisitions as well as forming a joint 
venture called Kentz Global to address opportunities 
in the market for the provision of oil and gas 
production facilities. Recently in following this 
strategy Kentz has been able to develop a significant 
pipeline of opportunities, with existing clients that will 
underpin future growth. 
During 2011 we completed the acquisition of RNE,  
a South African supplier of engineering services, 
which has exceeded its revenue and profit targets  
for the year. Its addition reinforces the development 
and execution of several EPC projects underway in 
South Africa and in time should support the global 
operations of Kentz. 
In a number of cases Kentz has been able to pursue 
growth and new opportunities with clients through 
the formation of strategic joint-ventures. During 2011 
new joint-ventures in Australia, Qatar and Saudi 
Arabia were created with larger Engineering and 
Construction companies; confirming my belief that 
Kentz brings significant benefits through its global 
approach and local presence. These partnerships 
have supported Kentz to follow larger projects 
bringing an integrated service solution to existing  
and newer clients. WWW.KENTZ.COM 21 KENTZ CORPORATION LTD ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2011
At the end of December 2011 we had grown our 
gross cash to just over US$238 million, an increase  
of approximately US$27 million from the position 
reported at June. We see three uses for this cash; 
further acquisitions, working capital finance for 
organic growth and reassurance; that we have the 
balance sheet strength to take on larger projects  
with our clients. 
Our dividend policy remains as it has been; to pay 
between 20-25% of profits, and I am confident that 
the utilisation of shareholder cash, to grow the 
business organically and through acquisition, will 
provide the best return to our investors. The global 
energy and resources landscape for new project 
development during 2011 continued to focus on 
remote and emerging areas. In line with this Kentz’s 
addressable market; our pipeline of opportunities 
with our key clients and sectors, has grown 23%  
to in excess of US$10 billion. We are continuing to 
convert opportunities from this extended pipeline in 
line with previous tender success rates. During 2011, 
the total order intake to backlog was up almost 80% 
to US$2.26 billion, providing very good visibility of 
future work through to 2015. 
Risk management is a constant focus of the 
Company. We have witnessed some fluctuations in 
the variables that make up our costs and retaining  
a disciplined approach to risk management 
throughout the bid, proposal and delivery phases is 
of paramount importance to our success. I believe 
that some amount of risk is mitigated by doing 
business with clients we know and who like working 
with Kentz. Once again repeat business with existing 
clients was a strong feature of Kentz in 2011. 
 Æ Page 38 for full risk breakdown
Execution excellence in health and safety is central  
to the successful operation of our business. It is a 
value that is reinforced from the very top level of  
the organisation to every individual working in our 
projects across the world; and defines our reputation 
in securing repeat work with core clients. During 
2011 our workforce grew to an average of 14,000 
employees worldwide and we delivered 52.5 million 
man-hours of work in 29 countries. 
Given our strong pipeline of opportunities and  
sound financial base, the most pressing constraint  
to our growth is hiring and retaining the very best 
people in the industry. Kentz has a strong culture  
and well-established training and development 
programmes for people at all levels of the 
organisation. Nonetheless, our rapid growth has 
meant the need to supplement the existing team  
with a number of external hires and 2011 saw the 
culmination of this search at a senior level; including 
my recruitment in August 2011 and subsequent 
appointment in February 2012 as the Group’s Chief 
Executive Officer.
It was an easy choice to join a business with a great 
track record and with such potential for the future.  
I look forward to the next few months with great 
excitement and will seek in the coming year to  
define where we see the greatest opportunities to 
further strengthen geographic and end market 
diversification and to enhance earnings growth 
focusing on 2014 and beyond.

Pearl Gas to Liquids (GTL) Project in Ras 
Laffan Industrial City, Qatar is the largest 
GTL project in the world and jointly 
developed by Qatar Petroleum (QP) and 
Shell. It is the world’s largest source of 
GTL products, producing 140,000 barrels 
of GTL products each day and 120,000 
barrels of oil equivalent per day  
of natural gas liquids and ethane.
Kentz has successfully completed a 
number of multi-million dollar contracts 
over the past five years on Pearl GTL. 
These contracts have encompassed all 
three of Kentz’s Global Business Units: 
Specialist Engineering, Procurement and 
Construction (EPC); Construction; and 
Technical Support Services. 
Kentz won its first major contract on the 
project in 2006. The EPC business unit was 
awarded the EPC scope for the modular 
waste water treatment plant for the 35,000  
man construction camp. This was followed 
by the diesel power generation scope and 
the temporary telecommunications for the 
plant’s turnkey temporary facilities. 
Kentz’s share of the first phase of the 
project (common facilities and train 1) 
totalled in excess of US$320 million.  
The project entailed the development of 
upstream gas production facilities and an 
onshore GTL. The project also included the 
development of a block within Qatar’s vast 
North Field gas reserves which will produce 
1.6 billion cubic feet per day of natural gas. 
Later in the project lifecycle, during 2009 
and 2010 Kentz’s focus turned to delivering 
the construction of utilities packages. The 
construction business unit was awarded 
the electrical and instrumentation scope  
for the utility and flare areas, materials 
management and commissioning support. 
This enabled the commencement of 
critically important process utilities 
commissioning: a precursor to plant- 
wide systems completion. 
The Technical Support Services business 
unit became involved in the final stages 
of commissioning of the mega project. In early 
2011, Kentz was awarded a Framework 
Agreement to provide services in executing 
Plant Change Requests by Qatar Shell GTL 
Limited. Under the Framework Agreement, 
Kentz provides engineering design, 
construction supervision and procurement 
services for plant changes and projects at 
Pearl GTL plant as well as to its offshore 
platforms, harbour tank farms, offloading 
jetties and connecting infrastructure. The 
duration of this contract is three years, with a 
two-year extension option. The services will 
be executed in the Kentz Doha office using 
existing multi-discipline engineering teams. 
Having been involved in this world-scale 
project from initial site works through 
to commissioning activities, Kentz is 
delighted to continue working with Shell 
in the operational and maintenance phase 
of the project with brownfield engineering 
services over the coming years.
In mid-2011, the Pearl GTL plant sold its 
first commercial shipment of GTL Gasoil, 
marking the start of production. The plant 
is expected to reach full production 
capacity by the middle of 2012. WWW.KENTZ.COM 25 KENTZ CORPORATION LTD ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2011

Overview
Kentz is a global supplier of specialist solutions to  
the oil and gas, petrochemical and mining and  
metals sectors. In the year ending December 2011,  
the Company generated revenues of US$1.37 billion 
and profit before tax of US$79.4 million.
Kentz employed an average of 14,000 people over  
the course of 2011 in 29 countries. It delivered  
52.5 million man-hours with a total recordable  
incident ratio of 0.35, through its three main business 
lines: Specialist Engineering, Procurement and 
Construction (EPC) Services; Construction; and 
Technical Support Services. 
Kentz’s business model is based on delivery of 
mechanical, electrical, controls and instrumentation 
engineering, and construction and management 
services in some of the most remote locations on 
earth. It generates a significant proportion of revenues 
through repeat business with its strong, blue-chip 
client base. 
At the end of December 2011, the Group’s backlog  
of work stood at US$2.4 billion (2010: US$1.6 billion)  
and its pipeline of prospects was in excess of  
US$10.0 billion (2010: US$8.1 billion). Kentz continues  
to grow its addressable market through ongoing 
geographic expansion, new service offerings and  
an expanded client base. 
Operating environment
While energy associated stocks were hit during 2011 
by a number of credit rating agency downgrades and 
ongoing European debt concerns, the longer-term 
outlook for the energy and resource services sector 
remains robust.
Kentz is currently involved in a number of significant 
resource and energy projects in the world. Just a few 
are: Kearl Oil Sands in Canada, PNG LNG in the 
Southern Highlands of Papua New Guinea; the 
development of the Jubail II infrastructure in Saudi 
Arabia; ongoing development at Sakhalin I in  
Far East Russia; and the Gorgon LNG project in 
Western Australia. 
The IMF’s baseline petroleum price projection for 
2012 is broadly unchanged since September 2011  
at US$99 a barrel, making the development of most 
global oil reserves financially viable. Oil and gas 
exploration and production is increasing in new and 
remote areas. Kentz’s ability to deliver in challenging 
locations, mainly for International Oil Companies 
(IOCs) and National Oil Companies (NOCs), has led 
to a significant demand for our services and we 
expect this to continue. 
The International Energy Agency (IEA) has reported 
that global oil demand is forecast to climb to 89.9 
million barrels per day (mbpd) in 2012, an increase of 
0.8mbpd on the year. It is encouraging that 2012 
capital expenditure for many of our IOC and NOC 
clients has again been increased for upstream 
exploration and production projects. WWW.KENTZ.COM 29 KENTZ CORPORATION LTD ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2011

Operational overview 
The Middle East remains a significant area of 
operation for Kentz despite revenues in the region 
dropping marginally for the period. The civil unrest in 
early 2011 in certain parts of North Africa and the 
Middle East did not have any material impact on our 
business and we have continued to secure notable 
contracts in the countries in which we operate.
The award of a Framework Agreement with Qatar 
Shell GTL Limited at the Pearl Gas to Liquids (GTL) 
plant at Ras Laffan Industrial City, Qatar, was very 
encouraging. The Agreement covers services for 
plant change requests over the next three years,  
with a two-year extension option. This latest award 
follows Kentz’s successful completion of a number  
of multi-million dollar contracts over the past five 
years on the Pearl GTL Project in which all three of 
our Global Business Units have been involved. 
 Æ Page 24 for client project lifecycle
Very often, once Kentz teams are mobilised to a 
project and delivering for the client, we see significant 
growth in the scope and services that we are asked 
to perform. This featured strongly in our business 
again for 2011 with 30% of order intake coming from 
natural growth in existing contracts. 
The brownfields services award with Qatar Shell GTL 
is also a good example of how involvement in the 
capital build phase of a facility positions us well to 
extend our service offering into the operating period. 
We have done this successfully with a number of 
core clients across our global operations.
In January 2011 Kentz was awarded a US$30 million 
contract by Abu Dhabi Gas Industries Ltd (GASCO) 
for the replacement of the existing emergency 
shutdown (ESD) system and associated field 
instrumentation at Habshan 0 and Habshan 1 plants. 
The works will be completed throughout two major 
shutdowns: one delivered in 2011 and the second 
due in 2012. It is a strategic initiative to pursue more 
asset enhancement services including brownfield 
engineering, maintenance and turnaround, and 
operations support. 
 Æ Page 36 for further details on Technical 
Support Services
Further awards secured in the period include a 
procurement, construction and commissioning 
contract worth in the order of US$33.6 million by 
Bariq Mining Limited and a US$32.7 million contract 
for the reduction area electrical and instrumentation 
on the Ma’aden Alcoa Aluminium Joint Venture, both 
in Saudi Arabia. Kentz’s first international project was 
in Saudi Arabia in 1977 and it is rewarding to be 
winning work in the early stages of the expansion of 
its mining and metals sector. 
Projects in the mining and metals industry have been 
growing as a proportion of Kentz’s revenues. For the 
full year 2011 they accounted for 24% of revenues, 
up from 12% in the prior period. Southern Africa has 
historically been a leading centre for mining and 
metals and we have seen strong demand for the 
provision of our full complement of structural, 
mechanical, electrical, instrumentation and piping 
services in this market. Recent investments in base 
and precious metals projects, particularly in Africa 
and Australia, have been driven by buoyant global 
demand, despite perceptions about a weakening 
Chinese economy.

Introduction continued
Kentz has been operating in South Africa since the 
early 1980s and its strong client relationships, 
business centres and workforce place it well to 
service the wider region. Southern Africa continues 
to be a large area of operation for the Group. 
Revenues for the full year 2011 were up over 100% 
and our pipeline of prospects has grown by a similar 
percentage. 
Kentz has a number of ongoing capital and 
brownfield EPC projects with Sasol through our 
engineering contractor agreement and the 
acquisition of RNE early last year has unlocked 
further potential with this client and across the 
sectors we are currently serving. 
 Æ Page 32 for further details on Specialist EPC 
During the year Kentz was awarded a US$35 million 
contract by the National Petroleum Refiners of  
South Africa (Natref) at the Natref Crude Refinery  
in Sasolburg, a joint venture between Sasol Mining 
(Pty) Ltd and Total South Africa (Pty) Ltd. Kentz has 
been working with Sasol for over 30 years. This latest 
contract is for the shutdown management and 
execution services at Natref, including planning, 
preparation and execution of all shutdowns and 
turnarounds over a five-year period. These longer-
term contracts are typically reimbursable, supporting 
visibility of earnings. 
Backlog at the year-end included 60% reimbursable 
service contracts, 10% unit rate reimbursable and 
30% lump sum work. Kentz seeks to balance the 
margin opportunity with the risk profile of the projects 
we undertake and as we move into more and more 
remote locations, the current trend towards more 
reimbursable work with less risk is reassuring. 
Historically we have typically seen an average increase 
in scope of around 25% on most contracts from 
award to delivery and we see significant opportunity 
for continued natural growth during 2012. 
Kentz was awarded a significantly large reimbursable 
contract in 2011, in joint venture with CB&I, for the 
mechanical, electrical and instrumentation work on 
the Gorgon Project on Barrow Island, Western 
Australia. It has an estimated value of US$2.3 billion 
to the CB&I Kentz JV, an integrated joint venture 
between CB&I (65%) and Kentz (35%), and will 
employ more than 1,650 jobs for construction 
personnel in Western Australia over a four-year 
period.

Australia continues to emerge as the world LNG 
liquefaction hub with planned expenditure of 
approximately US$200 billion set to boost the 
country’s production sixfold to 120 million tons per 
annum. Kentz’s backlog in Australasia increased 
around 250% during the year 2011 to US$1.26 billion 
from US$362 million at the end of 2010. This has 
been driven by IOC capital expenditures to service 
domestic, regional and Asian demands for gas.

a consortium of owners including ExxonMobil as 
operator. The most recent contract, awarded in 
November 2011, is for the Electrical and 
Instrumentation, Construction and Commissioning 
Completions for the Hides Gas Conditioning Plant. 
Kentz has substantial opportunities in PNG to really 
differentiate its offering and could be there for many 
more years to service existing and future projects in 
both the capital and operational expenditure phases. 
Elsewhere, Kentz’s backlog of work in Russia is up 
100% and in the Americas has risen 50% during the 
year. We see substantial opportunities in both these 
regions and cross utilisation of resources to address 
similar demands for services in challenging Arctic 
conditions. In Russia the recent opening up of 
reserves for the participation of IOCs should benefit 
Kentz. We have a strong track record of working in 
Far East Russia, and have two joint venture 
partnerships with Russian companies that have 
been in place for a number of years now: DEM and 
SMNM (a Rosneft-owned company). 
Joint ventures have been a consistent feature of 
Kentz’s business. During 2011, we established a 
number of new, successful partnerships with larger 
engineering and construction companies: CB&I, 
Foster Wheeler, KBR and Chiyoda, that have allowed 
us to broaden our horizons and provide integrated 
solutions to our clients. 
This included, at the end of the year, the signing  
of an engineering, procurement and construction 
management (EPCM) framework agreement with 
Qatargas Operating Company Limited (Qatargas),  
in joint venture with Foster Wheeler. The agreement 
will be for three years with an option to extend for  
a further two years. The booking values for the 
projects will be recorded as individual service orders 
are received, but we see fantastic potential to bid  
for specific packages of work, including pre-front 
end engineering design (pre-FEED), FEED and 
EPCM services to be carried out in our Qatar 
engineering centre. 
Kentz now has six regional engineering centres  
of excellence supporting clients’ projects based in 
Canada, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Abu Dhabi, South 
Africa and Australia. The geographic spread of these 
centres ensures proximity to our clients and 
suppliers, as well as delivering global solutions to 
local challenges for more remote projects. Kentz is 
well-positioned with a global workforce, engineering 
centres and partnerships that will support its 
continued growth and expand its addressable 
market into new geographies, sectors and clients.

Review of operations
Specialist EPC
James Moore
Chief Operating Officer, 
Specialist EPC
Process EPC still represents the biggest 
opportunity for growth in Kentz, in both 
existing and new emerging markets. 
Our clients want reliable suppliers who 
deliver consistent results in any market.
Q.  Is Process EPC still an area of focus for 
growth in Kentz? Where are the biggest 
opportunities right now?
A. Process EPC still represents the biggest 
opportunity for growth in Kentz, in both existing 
and new emerging markets. Our clients want 
reliable suppliers who deliver consistent results  
in any market. Kentz combines a track record  
of execution in remote locations, strong local 
partnerships, in-house engineering, procurement, 
modular fabrication and construction, with 
commissioning, start-up and operation services. 
Challenging locations where projects require any 
number of these services are where Kentz is 
focused. We remain committed to execution 
excellence and opportunities are only considered 
under a continuous and rigorous approach to  
risk management and within our financial and 
technological reach. In the coming 18 months we 
see significant opportunities in Russia and Iraq. 
Q.  You completed the acquisition of RNE 
Engineering in 2011, how has it performed 
since acquisition? Are there further 
acquisitions on the horizon? 
A. RNE has exceeded its revenue and profit targets 
for the year. Its addition reinforces the execution 
of several EPC projects underway in South Africa. 
We are currently developing new opportunities  
in the oil and gas, metals and mining, and 
infrastructure sectors in Sub-Saharan Africa and 
have a positive outlook for 2012. In time we may 
unlock further potential within RNE to support our 
global operations. Kentz has grown organically 
almost 30% annually on average for the past  
five years. While our pipeline of prospects and 
financial capacity remain robust, acquisitions 
would be the natural next step to supplement our 
own technical and human resources. We also see 
significant upside in strengthening our regional 
presence to align with proximity and services  
to international oil companies (IOCs). Any 
acquisitions would most likely be smaller, bolt-on 
capabilities that deliver higher-value services and 
are therefore earnings-per-share enhancing.  WWW.KENTZ.COM 33 KENTZ CORPORATION LTD ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2011

Q. Joint venture partnerships seem to play an 
important role in project awards for Kentz. 
What are the advantages and disadvantages 
of these partnerships? 
A. Joint venture (JV) partnerships have a number of 
strategic advantages for Kentz. These include 
entry into new markets through local resource 
and experience, which can significantly de-risk 
projects where Kentz does not have a strong  
local office or where specific market or client 
conditions call for the use of significant local 
resources. A recent example is the three-way JV 
put in place for the Gorgon Construction Village 
contract on Barrow Island, Western Australia.  
By partnering with two local construction 
companies, Kentz was able to draw on  
additional domestic resources to supplement  
its own project management team. In other 
circumstances, a JV supports Kentz in bidding for 
larger projects to boost its own financial threshold 
and offer the best solution to the client. Especially 
for remote projects, clients are reassured by 
having two contractors partnered together to  
give certainty of delivery. As a result, the client 
sometimes recommends a joint strategy between 
companies which have a good track-record.  
One possible disadvantage of JVs is the shared 
responsibility, and risk that a partner might not 
perform. Kentz seeks to mitigate this to a large 
degree through selecting partners of a similar or 
larger size, who share like-minded values of client 
delivery and safety. In the past year, Kentz has 
established JV agreements for specific project 
opportunities with large engineering companies 
CB&I, Foster Wheeler and Chiyoda. We see 
longer-term possibilities through these JVs. 
Q. How is global engineering capacity 
currently? Are you seeing stronger 
competition for recruiting quality 
engineers?
A. Global engineering firms are currently 
experiencing a growth phase and traditional 
capacity models are being stretched.  
The industry trend has been towards the 
development of low cost high value engineering 
centres. To date we have managed to 
successfully grow engineering capacity 
organically to meet demand. We now have  
six engineering centres; in long-established  
hubs throughout the Middle East, and in newer 
project areas such as Australia and Canada. 
Development of capacity reflects the way in  
which clients, both national and international  
have bought our services. In many cases 
in-country or project specific engineering, as 
opposed to back-office centres, have served  
us well. We envisage future demand being met 
from continued organic growth and investment  
in capacity. 
Q. We saw in the interim management 
statement that a greater proportion of Kentz 
work is now reimbursable, does this bring 
down margin enhancement opportunities 
on EPC work?
A. The reimbursable element of EPC contracts 
tends to be the construction. The construction 
element of projects in logistically challenging  
and remote areas where there is little domestic 
construction activity is often contracted on  
a reimbursable basis. This allows higher visibility 
on cost and margin and facilitates a more 
reasonable approach to tendering. In these 
cases the margin on the construction element  
of the job may be slightly reduced, but in line 
with the reduced risk.

Business review
Review of operations continued
The outlook for metals and mining work 
remains very strong in our business. 
Over the past 10 years Kentz has 
worked on some significant metals  
and mining projects and built up a  
track record with a number of large 
resource companies.
Eoin Hurley
Chief Operating Officer, 
Construction
Construction
Q. Kentz grew its percentage of work in the 
mining and metals sector significantly in 
2011. Do you anticipate further growth in 
this area in the future?
A. The outlook for metals and mining work remains 
very strong in our business. There are three areas 
in particular that represent opportunity in the 
immediate term: East Africa, where repeat 
business with existing clients and projects looks 
very promising; West Africa, which is a new 
market for Kentz but where some key clients  
are looking to develop projects; and in Australia, 
which represents an untapped market for Kentz. 
Over the past 10 years we have worked on some 
significant metals and mining projects and built  
up a track record with a number of large resource 
companies. There is a significant opportunity to 
leverage this and grow our market share. In the 
longer-term we hope this will include new 
geographies such as South America and we are 
currently assessing options to secure market 
entry and a local presence. 
Q. The Middle East now represents a smaller 
percentage of the Kentz business. Is this 
due to intense competition in the region?
A. Construction revenues in the Middle East 
reduced in 2011. Construction in the region  
has become more competitive, but at the same 
time Kentz has seen significant opportunities 
elsewhere and has had the chance to move  
some of our very best construction project 
management teams to these new areas. The 
track-record we have built up over a 30-year 
period of delivering construction services 
internationally has been invaluable in securing 
recent construction contracts. Kentz delivered  
17 million man-hours of construction, without  
a lost-time incident, at the Pearl GTL facility in 
Qatar, and this was no doubt a determining factor 
in our bid for the Gorgon MEI contract in Australia. 
The Construction business continues to be the 
biggest contributor to Group revenues and with 
the award of new exciting projects like Gorgon 
MEI, it is likely to be for a significant time yet. 
Through a dynamic and global approach to the 
business we have managed to maintain industry 
comparable margins.  WWW.KENTZ.COM 35 KENTZ CORPORATION LTD ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2011

Q. The Gorgon MEI project was a significantly 
large award for Kentz, is there a high level  
of risk associated with this project?
A. Gorgon LNG is a significantly high profile project 
and we are delighted to be involved in three 
contracts on Barrow Island. The Gorgon MEI 
contract, secured in July 2011, was large in 
budget terms, but in fact is no bigger than 
previous scopes of work in terms of man-hours. 
The reality is that Australia is a higher-cost area 
and it will take an enormous amount of local 
human resources to deliver this project. For 
Kentz, the contract is de-risked to a large degree 
through a reimbursable commercial model. Aside 
from reputation risk this pricing structure gives 
Kentz complete certainty around payment terms. 
The project is driven through the client team, 
which retains control and flexibility that is 
reassuring to them. This contract was awarded  
to Kentz in JV with CB&I, a significantly large 
international engineering and construction 
company. We foresee further opportunities 
through this formidable joint venture as it is very 
complementary and both organisations have a 
major global footprint.
Q. Construction accounts for the largest 
proportion of the Kentz workforce, and 
some of its most remote projects. How do 
you overcome the challenges of health and 
safety?
A. Kentz’s workforce was in excess of 14,000 
people on average during 2011, which presents a 
significant health and safety challenge. Our goal  
is to have zero accidents and zero incidents, and 
this can only be achieved through personal 
accountability and a strong safety leadership 
culture. The safety of our people and our record  
in this area is continuously monitored, right at  
the very top of the organisation. Each member  
of the Executive Management team undertake 
commitments to audit our project sites on a 
regular basis and are accountable to the Board of 
Directors. Health and safety is our number one 
priority on every site and it goes without saying 
that large construction jobs, where the workforce 
can run into thousands, present particular 
challenges. Strong project management teams 
can mitigate this to a large degree, as well as the 
rigorous implementation of tried and tested Kentz 
processes and procedures. This is particularly 
important in newer areas of operation, where 
contracts can include the hiring and training of  
a large numbers of local, unskilled personnel.  
In these circumstances, it is imperative to have 
planning in place to ensure the requisite level of 
preparation and training. Our clients also place 
health and safety first, and in integrating with their 
on-site programmes we have seen tremendous 
benefits on projects where there may be a 
number of other contractors working in close 
proximity to our own teams.
Q. Operations in Australia and South Africa 
have grown significantly over the past 
couple of years. Is foreign exchange 
exposure becoming a greater 
consideration?
A. Kentz’s treatment of foreign exchange exposure 
is constantly monitored and we continue to have 
a careful and pragmatic approach in this regard.  
As far as possible, local costs are matched to 
local currencies. So for example significant 
material procurement would be done in country 
and by far the majority of employee contracts 
would be in the local currency; particularly for 
South African Rand and Australian Dollars. When 
required the Group also takes out foreign 
exchange cover with its banks to protect against 
foreign exchange risks.

Business review
Review of operations continued
Q. Kentz signed a Global Framework 
Continuing Engineering Service Agreement 
with ExxonMobil in early 2010. Would you 
like to target similar agreements on a global 
basis with other clients? 
A. The ExxonMobil agreement provides a framework 
for the provision of engineering, design and 
technical support services to its projects around 
the world. Its signing was the result of a strong 
relationship with ExxonMobil developed over 
many years; delivering on a broad range of capital 
expenditure projects in a number of geographies 
around the world. There is no guaranteed revenue 
generation through this agreement, but our 
relationship has continued to prove successful 
two years on. We do have similar service 
agreements in place: with Shell, Qatargas and 
Sasol, although not on a global basis. Where 
feasible it would be nice to establish similar 
agreements, but only where the client 
organisation reflects and utilises the flexibility  
and global reach that Kentz can provide. 
Q. You have highlighted Asset Enhancement 
Services as an area of growth for your 
business. How is this progressing?  
Would you look at potential acquisitions  
in this space?
A. About two years ago we took several operational 
phase capabilities we had already: Maintenance 
and shutdown, Brownfield engineering, and 
Operations support, and pulled them together 
into an Asset Enhancement Business to reflect 
the way that clients bought these services from 
us. Targeting specific opportunities with clients, 
particularly where Kentz has been involved in 
delivering the infrastructure, has reaped rewards 
in the past year. In the Middle East alone we  
have been awarded five long-term brownfield 
engineering service contracts which keep our 
teams in place following the start-up of a number 
of client facilities. Our strategy is to capitalise  
on the opportunities available in this business  
line through wider geographic expansion. We 
were delighted to complete a very successful 
shutdown at the Chavyo facility in Sakhalin at  
the end of last year that was delivered ahead of 
schedule. It is possible that we would look to 
make an acquisition, but these would most likely 
be smaller, bolt-on deals that help to gain market 
entry or local capability.

Q. Your business relies on securing the best 
people in the industry to work on remote 
projects. Are you seeing any constraints in 
the recruitment market right now? 
A. Kentz has grown very strongly over the last 
number of years and we have met this challenge 
quite successfully through the organic growth in 
our leadership teams. It helps that Kentz has a 
solid core of management, who have been with 
the Company an average of 17 years. By ensuring 
a core group of these personnel on any project, it 
is possible to supplement numbers from the local 
market or wider industry while keeping the Kentz 
style of execution and values of safety and 
teamwork. The progression of people through 
strong training and development is absolutely 
core to our business and as the Company has 
grown, the opportunities for up-and-coming 
management have been plentiful. As oil majors 
seek more and more remote reserves Kentz has 
been ideally placed to support their projects. 
Clients like the fact that they get the same team, 
the same delivery, wherever they take us.  
As projects have become more remote and 
challenging, it is natural that compensation terms 
and work rotations are attractive and this has 
allowed us to supplement our own teams with 
additional resource quite successfully. In reality, 
the downturn in certain Western economies  
has meant an increase in good people who are 
available and willing to travel where they might not 
have been before.
Q. There has been a lot of talk of Arctic 
development. Is Kentz targeting this as an 
area of future growth? 
A. Recent geographical surveys have estimated  
that as much as 20% of the world’s undiscovered, 
but exploitable, gas and oil reserves sit north of 
the Arctic Circle. Its recovery presents some of 
the most unique technical and environmental 
challenges ever seen. It is still early days, but our 
TSS business is well-placed to support with  
early phase services. We have a tried and tested 
model of delivery we can replicate from other 
areas with Arctic conditions, such as Sakhalin 
Island in Russia. Our track record includes the 
formation of strong local partnerships, which have 
continued long past their initial conception to 
target new project opportunities. Local content 
and resources have proved invaluable, especially 
in such challenging conditions, to supplement 
Kentz’s own project management, processes  
and procedures. We see the biggest immediate 
opportunities with core clients that are involved  
in the development of Arctic resources in Russia, 
Canada and Alaska. 
Q. The energy landscape in North America  
has shifted rapidly over the past few years. 
Where do you see it going and how will 
Kentz be involved?
A. The advent of cheap domestic gas in North 
America has been the catalyst to drive investment 
in projects for export or downstream beneficiation 
such as GTL and LNG. Several years ago the 
United States was building receiving terminals,  
so this has been a significant shift in political  
and economic policy. As long as the economic 
viability remains in place to develop new 
infrastructure, this should happen. Kentz sees  
the biggest opportunities with core clients, with 
entry through domestic engineering services in 
upstream oil and gas.

Reputation
Kentz operates in some countries which are 
perceived to have relatively high corruption  
levels (as rated by Transparency International).
During 2011 Kentz established a Code of 
Business Conduct which set out its expectations 
of Directors, employees and others we work with 
in relation to ethical business dealings, health 
and safety, corporate social responsibility, human 
resources, information and government relations.
Economic and political 
conditions such as 
regime change
Kentz operates in 29 counties and is 
expanding to more locations. The Middle East 
and North Africa (MENA) Region has seen  
an increase in the levels of political instability, 
civil disturbances and labour unrest. From  
time to time other locations experience 
industrial unrest.
Kentz has no current activities in North Africa and 
save for Yemen its MENA countries of operation 
have been generally stable. Kentz monitors 
economic indicators and political sentiments  
and also seeks to negotiate appropriate remedies 
to be included in its contracts with clients which 
cater for unforeseen events. 
Licences, registrations, 
accreditations and  
government regulations
Kentz has operations in certain areas 
which are subject to a number of licences, 
registrations and accreditations.
With support from corporate management, 
the management in each area follow defined 
procedures to keep abreast of renewals and 
ensure compliance with the requirements. During 
2011 all material licences and accreditations were 
successfully renewed.
Environment, 
health and safety
Significant deterioration in Kentz’s Safety, 
Security, Health and Environment record or 
reputation may have an adverse impact on the 
ability of the Group to secure business.
Safety is the number one value in Kentz and is 
embedded into the culture of the organisation. 
Focus on Safety is driven from senior 
management right down to project personnel. 
Kentz also has a behaviour-based programme 
that demonstrates the level of safe work habits its 
employees are exhibiting around the globe. Kentz 
has leading and lagging indicators in place to 
monitor safety performance.
Effective management of risk and 
opportunity is essential to the 
protection of Kentz’s reputation and 
the achievement of sustainable 
shareholder value. WWW.KENTZ.COM 39 KENTZ CORPORATION LTD ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2011
Regulatory risks
Risk Description Mitigating factors
Legal and  
sovereign risk
Kentz contracts are subject to governing laws 
outside of Western Europe and the United 
States.
Kentz reviews this risk as part of the tender risk 
review process and endeavours to limit this 
exposure by measures such as requesting a 
neutral venue or institute of repute to be identified 
in the contracts in the event there is a need for 
independent dispute resolution.
Market risks
Risk Description Mitigating factors
Demand for oil and gas
The demand for Kentz’s range of services 
may be dependent on the wider economy 
and activity within the oil, gas and resource 
industries. 
Kentz’s business is a balance between 
geographies, blue-chip clients and industries. 
In 2011 it continued to diversify its business to 
provide a better overall balance and thus reducing 
exposure to any one region or sector. 
Acquisitions 
Acquisitions may not be successfully 
integrated into the business and the financial 
results of acquired companies may fall short of 
targets. 
Kentz has a defined strategy and processes 
in relation to acquisitions. Internal and external 
resources are engaged to carry out due diligence 
on targets, deals are structured to ensure sellers 
remain actively involved and there are processes 
in place for post-acquisition activities. During  
2011 the RNE acquisition performed ahead  
of expectations. 
Competitors
The markets in which Kentz operates are 
competitive. 
Kentz works to develop and sustain long-term 
relationships. Measures are implemented to 
critically evaluate tender pricing to ensure 
competitive offers for clients. There are also 
high barriers to entry such as the need to satisfy 
clients’ regulatory, financial and health, safety  
and environmental criteria. 
Operational risks
Risk Description Mitigating factors
Counterparty credit
Kentz is exposed to counterparty risk primarily 
though its contracts with clients. 
Credit risk is considered as part of the tender 
review process and Kentz seeks to negotiate 
reasonable payment terms to mitigate such 
exposures. The majority of Kentz business is 
derived from large multinational energy and 
resource companies and to date Kentz has 
experienced a low level of bad debts.
Lump sum projects
Kentz operates its Specialist EPC and 
Construction business on the basis of lump 
sum or work unit rate contracts which are won 
through competitive tender processes. 
Kentz undertakes projects on a selective basis 
and tenders are subjected to a set of hierarchical 
reviews to identify risks and implement 
appropriate mitigation strategies. Controls are 
implemented during the execution phase so that 
management is alerted to any adverse trends 
prompting corrective actions. At 31 December 
2011, 60% of Kentz’s backlog was derived from 
reimbursable contracts.

Operational risks
Risk Description Mitigating factors
Reliance on joint 
venture/consortium 
partners 
Kentz’s performance on projects may be 
affected by the actions of joint venture or 
consortium partners. 
Kentz follows defined procedures in the selection 
of partners and seeks to agree cross guarantees 
and indemnities with partners in order to limit its 
liability for potential loss or damage.
Contract and cost 
performance 
Failure to deliver projects in the stipulated time 
and within Kentz’s budgeted cost could affect 
Kentz’s financial performance and in certain 
circumstances could potentially lead  
to disputes with clients. 
Controls are implemented during the execution 
phase and there is regular project reporting and 
management oversight. There are Board briefings 
to discuss progress of the major projects. The 
Risk Committee also provides oversight on the 
suitability of the risk identification and mitigation 
process adopted on selected projects. Kentz 
seeks to engage with clients to find mutually 
agreeable outcomes and formal dispute resolution 
procedures are extremely rare. 
Skilled personnel 
Kentz may be unable to attract and retain 
sufficient skilled personnel to meet its current 
and future needs. 
Kentz has successfully attracted sufficient 
personnel to date and through personal 
development measures such as skills 
enhancement training, further education and 
providing opportunities for career development 
Kentz has continued to meet the needs of  
the business.
Senior employees
Kentz depends on the continued service of 
senior personnel, including its Directors and 
senior management. 
Kentz monitors the marketplace to ensure 
remuneration levels remain attractive and also 
has succession planning measures in place, 
which are aimed at ensuring the development of 
its professional and management staff to provide 
successors, over time, for the Group's existing 
Directors and senior managers. 
Warranties
Kentz provides warranties on the projects 
it executes and in certain circumstances 
liabilities under these warranties may affect  
the financial performance of the Company. 
Kentz has implemented procedures to track the 
completion of projects to the required standards 
and where possible seeks to ensure suppliers  
and sub-contractors provide similar warranties  
in support of the commitments made by Kentz. 
Supplier risks
Risk Description Mitigating factors
Equipment 
manufacturers and  
sub-contractors
Kentz relies on inputs from third-party 
equipment manufacturers and sub-contractors 
for the delivery of its projects. These parties 
may not conform to delivery standards or 
schedules. 
Kentz evaluates the capability of potential 
suppliers and there are procedures in place to 
effectively manage outsourced manufacture 
of equipment along with the activities of sub-
contractors at sites. Kentz also seeks to build 
supply chain relationships based on performance. 
Supply chain risks 
Kentz’s supply chain may be affected by 
supplier insolvency, strikes, weather, port 
conditions and congestion, the actions of 
customs authorities and other unforeseen 
matters. 
These risks are considered at tender stage and 
monitored throughout the lifecycle of the projects. 
Where possible, alternative routes or sources of 
supply are investigated. 
Local content 
Certain locations where Kentz operates have 
requirements to promote involvement of local 
companies and resource pools where the 
projects take place. 
Kentz has successfully dealt with such 
requirements for many years through engagement 
with local resource pools and training initiatives.  WWW.KENTZ.COM 41 KENTZ CORPORATION LTD ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2011

Exchange rates 
Kentz invoices its customers in a variety of 
currencies and similarly, its costs are incurred 
in a number of currencies. 
The majority of earnings and costs are in US 
Dollars or currencies marked against the US Dollar. 
Kentz seeks to include adequate protection in its 
contracts with customers and where possible, 
endeavours to match the revenues and cost 
currencies to reduce exposure. When required, 
the Group also takes out foreign exchange

Corporate responsibility
Kentz aims to conduct its business in a socially 
responsible manner. We believe that the long-term 
future of the Company is best served by respecting 
the interests of all our stakeholders and the wider 
community. We actively seek opportunities to 
improve our performance and to contribute to the 
wellbeing of the communities in which we operate. 
This is undertaken in the framework of Kentz’s core 
values of Safety, Teamwork and Reputation.
During 2011, a project was undertaken to improve 
Kentz’s policies and reporting in Corporate 
Responsibility (CR) in order to direct Group 
resources to areas that are deemed most important 
to our employees.
A Corporate Responsibility Survey was issued to a 
selection of Kentz employees around the world, 
obtaining employees’ opinions on the environment, 
communities, our people and relationships. There 
was an excellent response to the survey and a Kentz 
Corporate Responsibility steering committee was 
established in September 2011 to oversee the 
development of CR going forward. Adrian Griffin, a 
member of our Management Executive Committee 
and Group Commercial Contracts and Risk Officer, 
was appointed to Chair the team, which comprises 
James Cassin, Group QHSE Manager, Elizabeth 
Rous, Group Head of Communications and Catríona 
Nugent, Communications Manager. It met once in 
Building better 
futures
As a responsible employer, listed on  
the Main Market of the London Stock 
Exchange, we believe that the long-term 
future of the Company is best served  
by respecting the interests of all our 
stakeholders: employees, clients, 
partners, shareholders, suppliers and  
the wider community.
the last three months of 2011 and going forward will 
convene four times a year. It reports quarterly to the 
Management Executive Committee.
The CR steering committee identified four main 
areas of focus as follows:
Employees
We respect our employees and encourage their 
development and training. We will promote equality 
as differences in responsibilities permit and consider 
the interests of our employees including their  
welfare, health and safety. We aim to empower our 
employees and recognise and reward individual 
contributions as well as teamwork. Through effective 
communication and consultation with employees 
and trade representatives we ensure that their views, 
opinions, suggestions and recommendations are 
considered openly and constructively. Our ultimate 
aim is the happiness of our employees through their 
worthwhile and satisfying employment in a 
successful business.
During 2011, Kentz employed an average of 14,000 
employees across the world including 64 different 
nationalities. Kentz has a policy of investing time and 
effort in the development of its people by supporting 
them through constant appraisal, coaching and 
training and by encouraging personal initiative.

Over 80% of employees 
surveyed felt that one  
or more people had 
positively influenced their 
career at Kentz.
37
%
37% viewed the family 
culture as being the  
most positive aspect  
of working for the 
Company, with 25% 
citing career progression 
opportunities. WWW.KENTZ.COM 43 KENTZ CORPORATION LTD ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2011
During 2011, over 8,000 employees received on-site 
training and development. In South Africa, our 
purpose-built training facilities at Chamdor in 
Johannesburg, the Medupi Power Station Project 
and our office in Vanderbijlpark saw 174 trainees 
develop new skills to become welders, boilermakers 
and electricians.
269 employees attended Skills Enhancement Courses 
(SECs) and 17 bursaries were allocated to students  
in South Africa to study disciplines of engineering, 
quantity surveying and accountancy at university or 
college. The average length of service in top 100 core 
management for 201 1 was over 17 years.
Health, Safety and Environment
It is the duty of all our employees to take all 
reasonable steps to manage our operations so as to 
minimise our environmental impact and to promote 
best health and safety practice.
We will set and follow high standards in operations, 
quality and safety and have Environmental 
Management Systems in place that meet the 
requirements of international standards (ISO 9001, 
ISO 14001 and OHSAS 18001). We will continue to 
promote responsible and sustainable operations in 
all of our global locations and review regularly our 
business practices and performance to identify how 
we can improve our energy efficiency, water usage 
and carbon emissions. We undertake to identify, 
assess and manage risks to the environment, 
communicate effectively and regularly with all 
stakeholders, and supply sufficient resources of 
time, personnel and finance to provide information, 
training and supervision to our workforce.
During 2011, Kentz completed over 52.5 million 
man-hours across the Group, an increase of 22.1% 
from 2010, with a Total Recordable Incident Ratio 
(TRIR) of 0.35. Kentz senior management completed 
over 94 safety leadership evaluations during 2011, 
46% of which were completed by the Management 
Executive Committee of Kentz.
The Safety Observation Card System of Kentz 
(SOCKS) continued throughout 2011, which allows 
us to monitor and observe employees beliefs and 
attitudes and eliminate unsafe acts. The programme 
focuses on the behaviours our employees exhibit  
on a day-to-day basis, in areas such as key points  
of communication, risk assessment, personal 
protective equipment (PPE), working postures and 
proper use of tools and equipment. During 2011, 
over 1.6 million observations were made, with only 
0.67% of them demonstrating unsafe acts.
Kentz has Environmental Management Systems  
in place that meet the requirements of ISO 14001. 
During 2011, the average electricity usage per 
person across our global offices was 247KW and the 
average paper consumption per person was 33kg,  
of which 7kg was recycled and 1kg was reused.  
We have set targets to reduce these consumption 
figures by 5% in 2012. There were over 85,000 
environmental observations done on Kentz sites 
during 2011, resulting in zero occurrences of 
non-compliance.
Kentz is committed to improving our environmental 
performance in the coming years and has set a 
target to make all our offices carbon neutral by 2018 
through a 5% reduction year on year on our 2012 
carbon emissions.
Relationships
We will conduct our business relationships with 
integrity and courtesy, and honour our contract 
commitments. Our aim is to build long-term 
relationships with our clients, partners and suppliers 
and utilise local companies and resources where 
feasible. We are committed to trading fairly with all 
our employees, clients, partners and suppliers, and 
commit the requisite level of resource to ensure we 
adhere to the highest levels of health, safety and 
environmental practice.
90
%
However, 90% felt that 
environmental issues are 
becoming a greater area 
of focus in our industry 
and the same percentage 
agreed that a more visible 
environmental stance 
would improve Kentz’s 
reputation.

Corporate responsibility continued
During 2011, the Gorgon LNG Telecommunications 
Project in Western Australia achieved considerable 
success in engaging Australian national and local 
suppliers for the sourcing and integration of the 
majority of major system packages, that make up the 
overall telecommunication and electronic systems.
Given the highly technical nature of much of the 
equipment and the fact that some components had 
by necessity to be sourced overseas, Kentz placed 
great emphasis on utilising local agents and 
integrators where possible, in order to maximise  
local content and input.
As a consequence, 25 major packages were 
sourced through Australian manufacturers, 
integrators, agents or distributors. This benefited 
local vendors by exposing them to international oil 
and gas industry practices and standards for the  
first time, which can only serve to strengthen the 
technical capability of these companies.

%
Over 50% of those 
surveyed want to know 
more about which 
charities we are already 
supporting and almost 
20% are keen to get 
involved in our Group 
efforts in this area.
Communities
Kentz strives to become an active member of the 
communities in which we operate and supports a 
number of charitable, social, recreational, wellbeing 
and cultural initiatives. Kentz operates in 29 countries 
and each community is unique. We will listen to 
community needs and expectations and obtain a 
wide range of views on our social and environmental 
policies and performance. We encourage our 
employees to consider the needs of others and 
involve themselves in public service in order to 
continually develop a sustainable community for all.
Working with WaterAid
During 2011, Kentz formed a partnership with  
the global charity, WaterAid, whose vision is a  
world where everyone has access to safe water  
and sanitation. 
WaterAid operates in over 27 countries including 
India, Madagascar, Papua New Guinea and 
Mozambique. Working in some of the world’s 
poorest communities, WaterAid transforms lives  
by improving access to safe water, hygiene  
and sanitation. WaterAid works with partner 
organisations to provide practical technology  
and sustainable solutions which are cost-effective 
and fit-for-purpose.  WWW.KENTZ.COM 45 KENTZ CORPORATION LTD ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2011
85
%
Almost 85% of people 
agreed that Kentz should 
set a goal to contribute a 
defined portion of 
attributable profits each 
year to charity.
Respondents viewed  
the following charitable 
causes in this order of 
importance: 
(1) Education  
(2) Disaster relief  
(3) Medical 
(4) Community  
(5)  Culture and sports
WaterAid and its partners work with local 
communities to build water points and latrines,  
give simple engineering training and promote good 
hygiene practices. Working in schools can play  
a vital role in keeping children in education and 
disseminating hygiene messages to the wider 
community, thus reducing incidences of diarrhoea 
caused by dirty water and poor sanitation.
 
After meeting with the WaterAid team and hearing 
about the fantastic work they do across the globe, 
Kentz decided to support WaterAid projects in 
Madagascar and India. Kentz is currently working  
on the Ambatovy Nickel and Cobalt Mining Project  
in Madagascar and hires a large proportion of its 
workforce from different regions of India. 
Read more about how Kentz’s funding helped 
WaterAid make a difference in these countries  
during 2011 in the Kentz’s 2011 Corporate 
Responsibility report. 
Kentz is proud to be aligned with WaterAid and  
its aspirations to make a sustainable difference to 
thousands of people’s lives every year by giving them 
access to basic services through simple engineering 
solutions. We look forward to developing our 
involvement further in the coming year. For more

Strength in 
numbers
Revenue
Sales revenues increased by 29.3% in 2011 to 
US$1,367 .5 million (2010: US$1,057 .4 million) as 
a result of an exceptionally strong performance 
in Africa, and strong growth in Australasia and 
the Americas. 
The breakdown of revenue by business unit shows  
an increase in our core Construction business which 
accounted for 51% of Group revenue (2010: 45%)  
EPC 26% (2010: 32%) and Technical Support 
Services (TSS) 23% (2010: 23%). Overall Construction 
revenues increased by 48% during 201 1 due to strong 
performance in the Africa and Australia regions.  
TSS revenues grew in line with overall Group revenues 
to maintain their 23% share of total revenues  
and Specialist EPC revenues grew by 5% which 
accounted for 26% of Group revenue. 48% of total 
revenues in the period were reimbursable while 31% 
were lump sum and 21% were unit rate reimbursable.
Backlog at 31 December 2011 included 60% of 
reimbursable service contracts which reduces the 
risk profile of the group. These contracts also carry 
good potential for future natural growth.
Sales to the oil and gas and petrochemicals markets 
in 2011 totalled US$841.8 million or 61.6% of Group 
revenues, up US$56.1 million or 7 .1% from US$785.7 
million in 2010. The largest growth sector has been in 
mining and metals with revenues of US$332.7 million  
or 24.3% of our business, up by US$203.8 million or 
158.1% (2010: US$128.9 million or 12.2%). Our 
remaining revenues have come from the power 
sector (6.8%), and from other sectors (7 .3%). 
Gross profit
Gross profits of US$160.9 million or 11.8% of sales 
were recorded in 2011, an increase of US$27 .4 
million or 20.5% on the 2010 figure of US$133.5 
million. The dip in the gross margin from prior year 
(11.8% compared to 12.6% in 2010) is mainly due to 
the following factors:
•	 Higher proportion of Construction work in the 
period (typically our lowest margin business), 
combined with the application of our conservative 
profit recognition policy which precludes us from 
taking profit on such projects in the early stages 
of execution.

•	 We have experienced timing differences in profit 
recognition on some EPC projects which have  
not progressed as quickly as expected, including 
our project in Yemen which is still on hold and  
we have also seen some increased competition in 
the Middle East region which has impacted our 
margins there.
•	 More sales achieved on the Medupi project in 
South Africa in 2011 than in 2010 with no margin 
taken to date. We have deployed additional 
management resources to support the project 
team to ensure successful completion and 
discussions are continuing with our client 
regarding recovery of certain additional costs 
incurred. In line with our prudent policy on such 
matters we made a provision for these costs in H1 
2011 and we have maintained that provision in the 
full year results. We have completed a detailed 
review of the project and we are satisfied the 
current level of provisioning is sufficient.
•	 Increase in profits coming from joint venture 
activities in Australia which are equity accounted 
and as such are included under share of joint 
ventures’ profit below.
SG&A Expenses
Selling general and administration expenses 
increased by US$18.1 million in 2011 to US$96.1 
million in absolute terms (2010: US$78.0 million).  
This increase reflects the growth of the business as 
well as the non-recurring costs associated with our 
move from AIM to the Main Market of the LSE and 
the investment made in additional management 
resources to manage that growth. In relative terms 
the 2011 figure comes in at 7 .0% of sales, which is  
a reduction from 7 .4% in 2010. 
Operating profit
Operating profit before finance costs for the year 
increased by US$9.8 million to US$66.1 million. 
Geographically, the main increase occurred in the 
Southern African region where strong performances 
by all business units contributed to an increase in 
profits. This growth is primarily attributable to the 
strong performance of the mining and metals sector. 
All the other regions reported a solid performance, 
particularly Australasia where we have seen a 27 .8% 
growth in profits from our joint ventures. 
Net finance expense
Net finance (expense)/income for the year was 
US$0.7 million negative, down US$0.9 million from 
the 2010 figure. This reduction is due to additional 
interest charged on borrowings and bank overdrafts 
in South Africa. The borrowings relate primarily to 
lease asset finance for the purchase of fixed assets. 
Deposit interest for the year amounted to US$1.8 
million, an increase of US$0.3 million on 2010.
Profit before tax
Profit before tax for 2011 was US$79.4 million,  
5.8% of sales or 6.2% when non-recurring costs  
are excluded. This represents an increase of 17 .6%  
on the 2010 figure of US$67 .5 million or 6.4% of 
sales. The reduction in PBT margin is due to the 
same reasons as explained under gross margin 
above, in addition to the impact of the non-recurring 
costs of US$2.9 million associated with the move 
from AIM to the Main Market as well as non-recurring 
senior management engagement costs of US$2.1 
million also incurred.
Taxation
The tax charge for the year is US$18.1 million, which 
is an effective tax rate of 22.8%. This compares  
with an effective rate of 27 .4% for 2010. The lower 
percentage in 2011 is attributable to a combination  
of prudent tax planning coupled with benefits 
derived from the fact that more of our profits  
were earned in lower tax jurisdictions.
Net profit for the year
Profit for the year from continuing operations was 
US$61.3 million, up 25.1% on 2010. Net profit 
equates to 4.5% of revenue which is broadly in line 
with prior year and marginally ahead when allowance 
is made for non-recurring costs related to the move 
from AIM to the Main Market and senior 
management engagement costs. 
Non-controlling interest
The non-controlling interest for the period was 
US$2.4 million or 0.2% of sales (2010: US$1.7 million 
or 0.2%). This relates to a 50% holding in Kentz E&C 
Pty Limited by Thiess Pty Ltd and a 25% interest  
by our Black Economic Empowerment partner in 
South Africa in Kentz Pty Ltd.

Earnings per share
We have achieved strong growth in both basic and 
diluted earnings per share during the period.
Basic earnings per share for the year were 50.61 
US$ cents (2010: 40.66 US$ cents). This calculation 
is based on a weighted average number of 
116,312,519 shares in issue in 2011.
Diluted earnings per share for the year were 48.98 
US$ cents (2010: 39.91 US$ cents). This calculation 
is based on a weighted average number of 
120,199,721 shares in issue in 2011.
 
Dividends
The Group reports its financial results in US dollars 
and accordingly declares its dividends in US dollars. 
Dividends are paid in Sterling using an exchange rate 
calculated at the record date and shareholders have 
the option of electing to have their dividend paid in 
another currency. The interim dividend payment 
amounting to 5.0 US$ cents per share was made in 
October 201 1 and the Directors intend to propose a 
final dividend payment of 7 .3 US$ cents per share 
which would make a total dividend payment of 12.3 
US$ cents per share for the year ended 31 December 
201 1. This equates to a payout equivalent of 25% of 
diluted EPS which is at the top end of our stated 
dividend policy range. If approved, this will represent

the close of business on 27 April 2012.
Working Capital
Working capital at year end was US$188.8 million  
or 13.8% of sales, up 35.7% on 2010 year end 
(US$139.1 million or 13.2% of sales). This increase 
mainly reflects the growth in the business coupled 
with the milestone payment terms on the Medupi 
contract which preclude invoicing for progress 
achieved until all elements of a particular milestone 
have been completed. The growth in the level of 
reimbursable work, while welcome from a risk 
reduction perspective also means that these 
contracts do not attract mobilisation payments.  
This has also served to increase the working capital 
requirement in the period.
Current assets at year end were US$655.8 million, 
up US$116.4 million or 21.6% on 2010 (US$539.4 
million). This growth is due to increased receivables 
of US$64.7 million, and work in progress of US$45.9 
million. Current liabilities at year-end were US$467 .0 
million, up US$66.7 million or 16.7% on 2010 mainly 
due to increase of US$70.0 million in trade and  
other payables.  WWW.KENTZ.COM 49 KENTZ CORPORATION LTD ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2011

shareholders during the year.
Total Assets
Total Assets at the end of the year were US$729.6

referred to above.
Cash flow from operations
Cash generated from operations for the year was 
US$52.7 million, down 33.7% or US$26.7 million on 
2010 levels. This is attributable to the requirement to 
invest significantly in working capital during 2011, as 
explained above.
Cash flow used in investing activities
Net cash used in investing activities amounted to 
US$0.2 million mainly as a result of returns received 
from our joint venture operations in Australia of 
US$17 .8 million (2010: US$10.3 million) and reduced 
levels of capital expenditure. The corresponding 
figure from 2010 was a net usage of US$22.8 million

Going concern
The Directors confirm that it is appropriate to apply the going 
concern concept in preparing the Financial Statements of the 
Group. In forming this view, the Directors have reviewed the 
Group’s budgets and projections, and have satisfied themselves 
that the Group is in a sound financial position.
Statement of Directors’ Responsibilities
Jersey company law requires the Directors to prepare the financial 
statements for each financial year which give a true and fair view of 
the state of affairs of the Group and of the Company and of the 
profit or loss of the Group for that year. In preparing those financial 
statements, the Directors are required to:
•	 Select suitable accounting policies and then apply them on a 
consistent basis.
•	 Make judgements and estimates that are reasonable and 
prudent.
•	 State whether applicable accounting standards have been 
followed, subject to any material differences disclosed and 
explained in the Financial Statements.
•	 Prepare the Financial Statements on the going concern basis 
unless it is not appropriate to presume that the Group will 
continue in business.
The Directors are responsible for keeping proper books of 
accounting records which disclose with reasonable accuracy at 
any time the financial position of the Group and the Company  
and to ensure that the Financial Statements comply with relevant 
legislation. They are also responsible for safeguarding the assets 
of the Group and for taking reasonable steps for the prevention 
and detection of fraud and other irregularities.
Auditors
The auditors, BDO, Registered Auditors, have expressed their 
willingness to continue in office in accordance with Article 109(4)  
of Companies (Jersey) Law, 1991.

Governance
Corporate Report
The holding company of the Kentz Group, Kentz Corporation 
Limited (the Company), has a Premium Listing on the Main Market 
of the London Stock Exchange (LSE: KENZ) and is a member of 
the FTSE 250 index. The Company is incorporated in Jersey. The 
Directors are responsible for the management and control of the 
Company and recognise the value of the principles of good 
governance whereby the Company follows the recommendations 
of the UK Corporate Governance Code (the Code). 
The Board considers that applying best practice in corporate 
governance is an integral element in developing, maximising and 
maintaining the success of the Group and in achieving its long-
term goals. It is therefore committed to the highest standards of 
corporate governance and to instilling in the Group the related 
principles with which it believes business should be undertaken. 
This process is reviewed on a quarterly basis at each Audit 
Committee meeting where the Group Compliance Officer and the 
Committee review relevant updates and best practices in relation 
to Corporate Governance requirements. 
UK Corporate Governance Code compliance
Kentz completed its move to a Premium Listing on the London 
Stock Exchange on 22 July 2011. As part of the process the 
Directors undertook a review of the requirements of the Code.  
This report covers how the Directors applied the principles of the 
Code during the year ended 31 December 2011. The Company  
is substantially compliant with the Code and, except where 
indicated, the provisions have been met. 
At the request of the Directors, an independent consultant 
specialising in internal audit and corporate governance, has 
undertaken an evaluation of the Company’s compliance with  
the Code, which has guided this review. 
Board composition
The Board comprises seven members including three independent 
Non-Executive Directors, each contributing individual experience 
from diverse backgrounds. In addition, there are two non-
independent Non-Executive Directors who have served on the 
Board since 1994. They provide focus and alignment and have 
many years of experience on the boards of publicly-traded 
companies. Finally, the two Executive Directors are responsible  
for the implementation of all Board decisions and oversee the 
management of the Group on a day-to-day basis. None of the 
Directors hold positions on the boards of other LSE-listed 
companies. 
The Chairman of the Board was, when appointed, not 
independent as he was then (and remains) a significant 
shareholder of the Company. 
In accordance with provision A.4.1 of the Code, David Beldotti was 
appointed as Senior Independent Director in October 2011. 
David Beldotti is Chairman of the Audit Committee and the Risk 
Review Committee and is also a member of the Nomination and 
Remuneration Committees. His role is to ensure, inter alia, that 
shareholders have a channel through which to communicate with 
the Board, and that enquiries relating to our Code of Business 
Conduct are appropriately addressed.

Board changes
On 31 January 2012, Hugh O’Donnell resigned as Chief Executive 
Officer and as a Director of the Company. He was succeeded in 
these roles by Christian Brown who previously held the position of 
Group Chief Operating Officer. 
In accordance with the terms of reference of the Nomination 
Committee, the committee members are currently considering the 
requirement to appoint an additional non-executive Director to the 
Board. 
The terms and conditions of appointment of all Directors are 
included in the Remuneration Committee Report on pages 62 and 
63 of the Annual Report. 
Re-election
The Company does not currently comply with the Code in respect 
of the annual re-election of all Directors. The Board believes that 
its existing arrangements on the re-election of Directors as set out  
in the Articles provide continuity of governance, while enabling 
proper accountability and underpinning board effectiveness. 
Independence
The Board considers the independence of each of the Non-Executive 
Directors upon appointment and on an annual basis or at any 
other time when circumstances change. The Board is satisfied  
that its composition will ensure that no individual, or group of 
individuals, will dominate the decision-making process. 
Following a review of the Board composition, the Company, in line  
with provisions B.1.2 of the Code, regards three of the current 
Non-Executive Directors to be independent within the meaning of 
“Independent” as defined in the Code. The Board considers that  
David Beldotti, Hans Kraus and Brendan Lyons are independent in 
character and judgement and free from relationships or circumstances 
that affect their judgement. In judging the independence of these 
individuals, the Board has taken account of the following:
•	 Independent Directors are not and have never been employees 
of the Group.
•	 Independent Directors do not receive any remuneration from 
the Group other than Director fees, nor do they participate in 
the Company’s share option scheme, long-term incentive plan 
or the Company’s pension scheme.
•	 Independent Directors do not have any close family ties with 
any of the Company’s advisers, Directors or senior employees.
•	 Independent Directors do not have any shareholdings in  
the Company.
•	 Independent Directors do not have any links with other 
Directors through involvement in other companies. WWW.KENTZ.COM 55 KENTZ CORPORATION LTD ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2011 55
Both Hans Kraus and David Beldotti have in the past provided 
additional and separately remunerated advice or other support  
to the Company. Previously Hans Kraus advised Kentz’s 
management on aspects of safety, health and environment and 
David Beldotti provided support to the Risk Review Committee 
on aspects of its activities. In neither case do the other Directors 
consider that this involved significant time and remuneration of 
the relevant Director relative to his overall commitments and 
income. These matters now come within the respective roles of 
Hans Kraus and David Beldotti as Directors and are reflected in 
their time commitment and ordinary remuneration as Directors.
After a rigorous review the Board continues to consider David 
Beldotti as independent, notwithstanding the fact he has been a 
Director of the Company for nine years in April 2012, and 
considers his extensive experience and knowledge of the 
industry to be invaluable to the Group’s success. 
The Board undertakes regular reviews to ensure that its 
composition is balanced and that its Directors have relevant 
industry and financial experience.
Functioning of the Board
The Board is collectively responsible for providing leadership, 
setting the Group’s strategic objectives and key policies and 
ensuring that appropriate resources are in place to achieve 
business success. The Board has put in place a schedule  
of matters reserved for its attention and approval.  
These include: 
•	 The Group’s long-term objectives and strategy.
•	 Matters relating to the structure and capital of the Group.
•	 Financial reporting and controls including internal controls,  
risk management and group accounting policies.
•	 Approval of annual operating budgets.
•	 Matters relating to major capital expenses: projects,  
contracts and acquisitions.
•	 Approval of the dividend policy and proposed dividend 
payments.
•	 Approval of the Annual Report and Accounts.
•	 Board membership and senior appointments; approval of 
contracts with Directors or related parties including the 
determination of the remuneration for the Directors and 
executive management.
•	 Approval of the Board Committees’ terms of reference.
•	 Undertaking an annual review of the Board’s performance 
and that of its Committees and individual Directors.
The Board of Directors review and challenge the strategy 
process adopted by the management of the Company and the 
strategic plan which is developed bi-annually. At the January 
2012 Board meeting, a detailed presentation was delivered  
by management as to the future direction of the Group which 
included a budget for 2012 along with strategic initiatives, a 
review of business and investment opportunities. Following a 
detailed review by the Board members, the strategic plan  
was agreed to be appropriate for the Group and the plan was 
approved. A detailed strategic review is currently under way 
which, once completed will be presented to the Board for  
further approvals. 
There is a clear and formally documented division of responsibility 
between the roles of the Chairman and the Chief Executive to 
ensure an appropriate balance of responsibility and accountability. 
It is the Chairman’s responsibility to ensure the effective 
functioning of the Board, including the provision of accurate, timely 
and clear information in relation to the Group and its business. He 
chairs the Board meetings, ensures the agendas are appropriate 
and is responsible for facilitating that all Directors actively 
contribute to the determination of the Group’s strategy. The 
Chairman is also responsible for encouraging debate and 
constructive criticism, speaking and acting for the Board and 
representing the Board to shareholders. The Board is satisfied that 
he makes sufficient time available to serve the Group effectively. 
The Chief Executive is responsible for the day-to-day management 
of the Group and implementation of Group strategy, developing 
proposals for Board approval, and ensuring that a regular dialogue 
with shareholders is maintained.
Advice 
All Directors have unrestricted access to the Corporate Company 
Secretary. The current Company Secretary is a corporate entity, 
which provides advice on the normal statutory compliance items 
that enables the Board to fulfil its role. 
Directors also have unrestricted access to members of Group 
senior management and a right to obtain independent professional 
advice at the Group’s expense in relation to their duties where they 
consider it appropriate to do so. 
Development
During 2011, prior to the Company moving from AIM to the Main 
Market, the Board received extensive briefings from the 
Company’s legal advisers, Simmons and Simmons and from its 
financial advisers Evolution Securities and Morgan Stanley. The 
Board also engaged with the Primary Listing Team at the London 
Stock Exchange to fully understand the ongoing requirements of 
moving from AIM to the Main Market in relation to the role and 
responsibility of the Board. 
Management of conflicts of interest 
The 2006 Companies Act (the Act) places a statutory duty on 
Directors to avoid a situation where they have, or could have, a 
direct or indirect interest that conflicts, or possibly may conflict 
with the Group’s interests. 
At the Annual General Meeting held on 27 May 2011, shareholder 
approval was obtained for the Company to adopt new Articles  
of Association coinciding with its admission to the Main Market. 
These new Articles include provisions for dealing with Directors’ 
conflicts of interests under which Directors are required to notify 
the Company Secretary of such events as they arise so that they 
can be considered by the Board. A Director may not vote on or be 
counted in the quorum to vote on any contract, arrangement, 
transaction or proposal in which he is interested except those 
specifically permitted in article 61.3 of the Articles of Association. 
Governance Governance WWW.KENTZ.COM 56 KENTZ CORPORATION LTD ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2011
Non-Executive Directors are also required to avoid any 
engagements with or instructions from other persons that might 
result in the creation of a conflict of interest. In the event such a 
situation has arisen, or is about to arise, the Non-Executive 
Director is required to notify the Board. If the Board decides that a 
conflict of interest has arisen, or may arise, the Non-Executive 
Director must immediately cease such activity or resign from the 
Board. 
Directors are required to disclose any conflicts of interests at all 
Board and Committee meetings that may exist or appear to exist. 
The Company has a share dealing code that covers dealings in  
its own shares by Directors and employees. It complies with the 
provisions of the UK Listing Rules and restricts dealings in shares 
and other relevant securities by Directors and employees during 
the designated close periods and any time that they are in 
possession of unpublished price-sensitive information.  
A notification outlining the dates of close periods is issued to 
Directors and employees by the investor relations team prior  
to commencement of the close period.
Directors are also obliged to notify the Company of their 
shareholding in the Company on appointment and to seek Board 
approval for any acquisition or disposal of shares while acting as  
a Director. 
The Company maintains a Register of Directors Interests at its 
registered office. Changes to Directors’ interests are reviewed  
at each scheduled Board Meeting.

Board performance evaluation
The performance of the Board is critical to the success of the 
Company. The Board regularly reviews its own performance and 
to date this review has been conducted internally. The Board is 
satisfied that each Director continues to contribute effectively and 
to demonstrate commitment to his responsibilities. The Chairman 
reviews the performance of each Non-Executive Director and that 
of the Executive Directors serving on the Board. The Chairman 
regularly meets with the Non-Executive Directors, without the 
Executive Directors present, to discuss issues pertaining to 
performance and remuneration; independent of this, the Chief 
Executive’s performance is reviewed by the Board on an annual 
basis. The Non-Executive Directors led by the Senior Independent 
Director also meet annually to evaluate the performance of the 
Chairman after taking into account the views of the Executive 
Directors.

any actions it deems necessary to better protect the interests  
of the Company.

Corporate Report continued WWW.KENTZ.COM 57 KENTZ CORPORATION LTD ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2011 57
The Audit Committee has put in place procedures relating to the 
provision of non-audit services by the Group’s external auditors. 
These procedures specify services that are permitted to be carried 
out by the external auditors and those that are not permitted. They 
also require that non-audit work with fees above a specific value to 
be approved in advance by the Audit Committee and the process 
of how that work should be tendered for. 
During 2011, the Company engaged BDO as Reporting 
accountants to facilitate its move from AIM to the Main Market of 
the London Stock Exchange. BDO were paid fees of US$351,000 
for their services. This appointment was approved by the Audit 
Committee. This work was non-advisory in nature and no 
management decisions were taken by BDO.
While the Group does not consider it necessary to have a formal 
requirement for rotation of external auditors, it has recently 
introduced a policy under which every three years the Audit 
Committee will consider the appropriateness of putting the 
external audit out to tender and will inform the shareholders as to 
their decision.

the prospectus. The Committee is satisfied that the current 
composition of the Board is adequate to provide guidance to  
the Group. 
The Committee will continue to review the Board and

Control framework and activities 
The Directors are responsible for establishing, maintaining and 
reviewing the effectiveness of the Group’s internal control systems. 
These systems are designed to manage, but not necessarily 
eliminate, the risks to the Group. They provide reasonable but  
not complete assurance against material loss or misstatement, 
including that from fraud. 
The internal control systems are reviewed by the Board on a 
regular basis. Throughout the year, senior management provide  
the Board with related reports to assist them with this review. 
Governance Governance WWW.KENTZ.COM 58 KENTZ CORPORATION LTD ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2011
The main elements of the internal control framework are set  
out below.
The Group has a clear management structure with defined lines of 
responsibility and clear delegation of authority. A key element  
of the overall control is directed by the Management Executive 
Committee, comprising the key senior executives of the Company. 
The Committee meets six times annually and its main focus and 
responsibilities are:
•	 Overseeing the Safety Leadership Charter.
•	 Developing and implementing Group strategy.
•	 Carrying out formalised risk reviews on selected projects 
throughout the Group.
•	 Reviewing Group financials, annual budgets and forecasts.
•	 Ensuring appropriate guidance is given to analysts.
•	 Planning news/project announcements.
•	 Reviewing Group backlog position across the Group.
The Chief Executive Officer reports at each Board meeting on  
the Group operational environment and activities of the 
Management Executive Committee. 
The Group’s policies and procedures are reviewed on a periodic 
basis and updated as necessary on an ongoing basis, for example 
those in relation to ethical business dealings as noted below.  
This process is designed to ensure that the Group’s policies and 
procedures are up-to-date, meet the Group’s requirements and  
are in line with best practice.
UK Bribery Act 2010
The new UK Bribery Act came into force in July 2011. Guidance 
from the government suggests that companies should adopt a 
risk-based approach to the application of the UK Bribery Act  
and as such the Company is currently obtaining legal advice 
concerning how the legislation will impact the Group. The Board 
has charged the Chief Financial Officer with overseeing its 
application to the Company. 
The Company relationships with shareholders
The Board represents the shareholders and is accountable to them 
for creating and delivering value through the effective governance 
of the business. It aims to develop a mutual understanding with 
shareholders on the Group’s strategic objectives and remains fully 
committed to ensuring regular communication with shareholders 
and reviews the following activities:
•	 The provision of regular dialogue with major institutional 
shareholders.
•	 Press releases regarding Company news which have been 
issued throughout the year.
•	 Kentz Group website, which contains all current news, 
including corporate presentations and accounts.
•	 The Annual Report is issued to all registered shareholders and 
contains extensive information about the Company’s activities.
Shareholders are encouraged to attend the Annual General 
Meeting which is attended by all Directors, to deal with any 
matters raised by shareholders. Questions relating to the strategy, 
performance and progress of the Company are welcomed at  
this meeting. 
The CEO, CFO and the investor relations team maintain regular 
dialogue with institutional shareholders. Formal meetings with 
investors, analysts and media take place throughout the year;  
at preliminary and interim results and at other times as requested 
by the investment community. Copies of these results 
presentations can be viewed on the Group’s website.
The Group’s investor relations team, based in London, acts as a 
point of contact for investors throughout the year. The Senior 
Independent Director is also available to shareholders on their 
request. 
Insurance cover
The Company maintains Directors’ and Officers’ liability insurance 
cover, the level of which is reviewed annually. 
Company Secretary
The current Company Secretary is a corporate entity, which 
provides advice on statutory compliance that enables the Board to 
fulfil its role. Other duties that would normally be carried out by an 
internal Company Secretary, such as the provision of timely 
information to the Board, are fulfilled by either the CEO or CFO. In 
terms of Corporate Governance issues the Board is advised by the 
Group Internal Audit Manager and external advisers as 
appropriate. The appointment or removal of a Company Secretary 
is a matter for the Board as a whole. The Board is satisfied that the 
current arrangement is adequate but will continue to review its 
effectiveness. 
Code of Business Conduct
The Group continues to maintain and build on our already 
well-established high standards of business conduct and ethics.  
In September 2011, the Company formalised all of the important 
behaviours expected of Group employees into a single Code of 
Business Conduct, which was approved by the Board.
The Group is committed to ensuring the highest legal standards 
and moral ethics guide all its business activities. This applies  
to the behaviour of all Directors, staff, sub-contractors, agents, 
consultants, contract labour, suppliers and others representing  
or acting for, or on behalf of the Company, its subsidiaries  
or joint ventures.
 
The Code of Business Conduct sets out to ensure that at every 
level of the organisation, at all times, all employees conduct 
through their own actions, their dealings internally and with third 
parties with the highest standards of honesty, integrity and 
fairness and foster an environment based on such standards,  
as well as complying with all related legislation in the countries in 
which they operate within.
Governance
Corporate Report continued WWW.KENTZ.COM 59 KENTZ CORPORATION LTD ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2011 59
The Group has its own internal procedures for monitoring 
compliance set out in its Code of Business Conduct, but also 
relies on its employees and external bodies “speaking up”  
where they become aware of actual or potential breaches of it. 
Speaking up relates to the disclosure of information by an 
employee or external body if they have a genuine concern  
about malpractice anywhere in the Group, such as instances of 
contravention of internal policies and legal and ethical standards, 
including activities or inactivities that put at risk the health  
and safety of Group employees or others, breaches of any 
environmental or regulatory requirements, bribery and corruption, 
false accounting, fraud and failure to comply with a legal obligation 
or a deliberate concealment of information relating to any of  
the above.
The Group is committed to ensuring any employee or external 
body’s concerns of malpractice are taken seriously and 
investigated and the ways to raise such concerns are set out in  
the Code of Business Conduct which can be found on the  
Kentz website www.kentz.com. 
Share Dealing Code
The Company has a share dealing code that covers dealings by 
Directors and employees. This code complies with the provisions 
set out in the Model Code contained in Annex 1 to Listing Rule 9 
of the UK Listing Rules. This code restricts dealings in shares and 
other relevant securities by Directors and employees during the 
designated prohibited periods and any time that they are in 
possession of the unpublished price-sensitive information.  
A notification outlining the dates of close periods is issued to 
Directors and employees by the investor relations team a  
month prior to each period’s commencement.
Market Disclosure
We are committed to maintaining the highest standards of 
disclosure ensuring that all investors and potential investors have 
the same access to relevant information in an accessible and 
timely manner to assist them in making informed decisions. 
Copies of announcements to the market, investor presentations, 
the Annual Report and other relevant information are published  
on the Kentz website.

Unaudited Information 
Remuneration Committee 
The Committee met four times during 2011 and the attendance record of 
individual Committee members is shown on page 56 of the Annual Report.
All three members of the Remuneration Committee, including the Chairman 
Brendan Lyons, were considered by the Board to be independent during 2011 
according to the criteria of independence set out in the Code. 
Following a review, the current terms of reference of the Remuneration 
Committee were adopted by the Board on 23 June 2011 immediately prior to the 
Company’s listing on the Main Market of the London Stock Exchange. These 
provide that it will determine and agree with the Board the framework or broad 
policy for the remuneration of the Group’s executive management and fix the 
remuneration for all Executive Directors, the Chairman and senior management  
of the Company. The remuneration of Non-Executive Directors is a matter for the executive members of the Board. No Director is involved 
in any decisions as to their own remuneration.
As recommended by the UK Corporate Governance Code, the Company has set the remuneration of Executive Directors at levels 
sufficient to attract, retain and motivate individuals of the quality required to run the Company successfully. 
The Company has taken into account the level of compensation in its industry and in the geographical markets in which it operates; the 
Company’s need for executive talent to continue its growth; and the equitable rewarding of its employees. 
Advice to the Remuneration Committee
The CEO and CFO provide internal support to the Remuneration Committee and attend meetings at the Committee’s invitation, except 
where matters associated with their own remuneration are being discussed.
The Remuneration Committee and its members are entitled to seek external advice as and when required. During the year the Company, 
using an outside consultant and its own resources, conducted a comprehensive exercise, benchmarking the compensation of its 
Executive Directors and senior management against comparable positions in similar companies. 
Following the review, the Company modified its compensation scheme to reflect industry practices for short-term incentives (STI),  
(annual cash bonus), long-term incentive (LTI) equity-based awards and total compensation as set out on pages 61 and 62. 
Executive Award Policy 
Kentz is a global engineering and construction company, operating in 29 countries, competing against international firms. The Remuneration 
Committee, with support from external consultants, has established executive compensation consistent with the external competitive 
environment. Executives are paid competitive base salaries and their overall remuneration is subject to achieving annual financial and 
long-term strategic goals. 
Short-term and long-term incentivised components of executive remuneration are variable. Levels of payout, determined by the 
Remuneration Committee, reflect executive and overall Group performance.

Balance between fixed and performance related pay
Chief Executive total compensation at threshold levels comprises a 50% bonus award based upon achieving the minimum financial 
threshold. The bonus award is a mix of 70% cash based short-term incentive and 30% equity based long-term incentive. The annual 
bonus award can be increased subject to the Chief Executive achieving financial, strategic and personal objectives, the maximum annual 
award amount shall not exceed 500% of basic salary.
Chief Financial Officer total compensation at threshold levels comprises a 40% bonus level based upon achieving the minimum financial 
threshold. The bonus award is a mix of 70% cash-based short-term incentive and 30% equity-based long-term incentive. The annual 
bonus award can be increased subject to the Chief Financial Officer achieving financial, strategic and personal objectives, the maximum 
annual award amount shall not exceed 200% of basic salary.
Base Package
Base packages reflect the Remuneration Committee’s assessment of the appropriate market fees for executive positions in the industry, 
as well as an individual’s level of responsibility, criticality and value to the business. Salaries are set at a level that allows the Company to 
attract and retain the very best talent. 
Following a review undertaken during the year, the Remuneration Committee has decided that base salaries for Executive Directors 
should be increased for 2012. This decision was taken in view of the general environment for salary increases for employees across the 
Group and the industry, as well as the investor environment and a desire to align remuneration with performance-based incentives.

* With effect from 31 January 2012, Hugh O’Donnell resigned as Chief Executive Officer of Kentz and ceased to be an Executive Director.  
Christian Brown succeeded him as Chief Executive Officer and Executive Director of Kentz.
Annual Bonus
The Remuneration Committee recommends the level of annual bonuses paid to the Executive Directors. The cash element of the annual 
bonus is split into two parts: one at the year-end and the other following the approval of the full year results. There are no individual 
targets for Executive Directors, but for any bonus to be paid, a minimum level of Company performance must be achieved. The payments 
to individual Executive Directors are shown in the Directors’ Emoluments table on page 64. 
During the year, overall compensation was restructured so that some element of the annual cash bonus will be replaced in part by 
Long-Term Incentive equity-based awards, thus structuring Executive Directors’ and senior management’s remuneration to link a 
significant element to the Company’s and the individual’s performance.

Report of the Remuneration Committee continued
Long-Term Incentives
The Long-Term Incentive award is a mixture of contingent stock awards (70% of award value) and performance stock awards (30% of the 
value) with a three-year vesting period. For the performance stock to vest in full, Kentz’s average basic earnings per share (EPS) growth 
must not be less than the average basic EPS growth for the same period for a peer group of designated industry competitors. If the Kentz 
actual basic EPS growth is more than 90% but less than 100% of the industry competitors’ performance, a pro-rated award value will be 
made. No vesting of performance stock will be made if Kentz’s basic EPS growth is less than 90% of the industry competitors’ average 
EPS growth.
Share Option Scheme 
The Company operates an equity-settled share-based remuneration scheme for key management. All key management are eligible to 
participate in the scheme, the only vesting condition being that the individual remains an employee of the Group over the savings period. 
In addition, the options will lapse if the individual leaves within 2 years of satisfying the criterion.
Pensions
Executive Directors receive pension contributions of an annual amount equal to 10% of their base salary, paid into the Company  
pension scheme.
Non-Executive Directors do not participate in the Company’s pension arrangements.
Other Benefits
The Company’s policy is to provide Executive Directors with private medical insurance, life assurance and a company car allowance.  
In addition, Executive Directors are entitled to housing allowances dependent on their geographical location. 
Shareholding
The Executive Directors hold a substantial number of shares in the Company and have interests in shares under share incentive 
arrangements at 31 December 2011 as shown below. 
Shares held Hugh O’Donnell* Ed Power Christian Brown*
Ordinary shares 7,500,000 1,018,936 –

Ed Power’s shares are held indirectly through Danache Holdings Limited. Ed Power has a beneficial interest of approximately 18.1% of 
Danache Holdings Limited. The shares in Danache Holdings Limited are held by Essex Trust Limited in trust for certain managers of the 
Group, of which Ed Power is one. 
Service Agreements
The Executive Directors’ service agreements with the Company do not set a fixed term. In normal circumstances, the agreements may  
be terminated by the Company or by the Director giving no less than six months’ notice for the Chief Financial Officer and no less than  
12 months’ notice for the Chief Executive Officer. The Board is of the view that these notice periods are appropriate to recruit and retain 
the Executive Directors. During 2011 the Remuneration Committee reviewed the employment contracts of Executive Directors as part  
of the preparation for the transfer to the Main Market of the London Stock Exchange.

n on-Executive Directors
The Non-Executive Directors do not have service contracts, but their terms of service are set out in a letter of appointment which 
provides, inter alia, that a Non-Executive Director may resign at any time; and that their service may be terminated by the Company giving 
three month’s notice, or by shareholders refusing to re-elect them. Appointment may be terminated by each party giving three months’ 
notice in writing. 
The Board does not comply with Code Provision B.7.1, in respect of the annual re-election of all directors. The Board believes that  
its existing arrangements on the re-election of directors provide continuity of governance, while enabling proper accountability and 
underpinning Board effectiveness. Directors submit for re-election every three years with the exception of David Beldotti and Hans Kraus,  
who both being over 70 years of age will submit for re-election on an annual basis.  KENTZ CORPORATION LTD ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2011 WWW.KENTZ.COM 64 64

To the shareholders of Kentz Corporation Limited
We have audited the Group Financial Statements of Kentz 
Corporation Limited (“the Company”) and its subsidiaries (together 
“the Group”) for the year ended 31 December 2011 which 
comprise the Consolidated Income Statement, the Consolidated 
Statement of Comprehensive Income, the Consolidated Statement 
of Financial Position, the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows, 
the Consolidated Statement of Changes in Equity and the related 
notes 1 to 34. These Group Financial Statements have been 
prepared under the accounting policies set out therein.  
This report is made solely to the Company’s members, as a body, 
in accordance with Article 113A of the Companies (Jersey) Law 
1991 and the terms of our letter of engagement. Our audit work 
has been undertaken so that we might state to the Company’s 
members those matters we are required to state to them in an 
auditors’ report and for no other purpose. To the fullest extent 
permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility to 
anyone other than the Company and the Company’s members as 
a body, for our audit work, for this report, or for the opinions we 
have formed.
Respective responsibilities of Directors and Auditors
The Directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report and 
the Group Financial Statements in accordance with applicable 
Jersey law as set out in the Statement of Directors’ 
Responsibilities and International Financial Reporting Standards. 
The Directors have complied with the requirements of rules 9.8.7 
and 9.8.7A of the Listing Rules of the UK Financial Services 
Authority in preparing its Annual Report.
 
Our responsibility is to audit the Group Financial Statements in 
accordance with relevant legal and regulatory requirements and 
International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland).
We report to you our opinion as to whether the Group Financial 
Statements give a true and fair view and whether the Group 
Financial Statements have been properly prepared in accordance 
with the Companies (Jersey) Law 1991. We also report to you 
whether, in our opinion, we have not received all the information 
and explanations we require for our audit. 
We read other information contained in the Annual Report and 
consider whether it is consistent with the audited Group Financial 
Statements. The other information comprises the Chairman’s 
Statement, Chief Executive Officer’s Report, the Corporate 
Governance Report, Chief Financial Officer’s Report, Directors’ 
Report and the Report of the Remuneration Committee. We 
consider the implications for our report if we become aware of any 
apparent misstatements or material inconsistencies with the Group 
Financial Statements. Our responsibilities do not extend to any 
other information.
Basis of opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with International 
Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland) issued by the Auditing 
Practices Board. An audit includes examination, on a test basis,  
of evidence relevant to the amounts and disclosures in the Group 
Financial Statements. It also includes an assessment of the 
significant estimates and judgements made by the Directors in the 
preparation of the Group Financial Statements, and of whether the 
accounting policies are appropriate to the Group’s circumstances, 
consistently applied and adequately disclosed.
We planned and performed our audit so as to obtain all the 
information and explanations which we considered necessary in 
order to provide us with sufficient evidence to give reasonable 
assurance that the Group Financial Statements are free from 
material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or other 
irregularity or error. In forming our opinion, we also evaluated the 
overall adequacy of the presentation of information in the Group 
Financial Statements.
Opinion
In our opinion:
•	 The Group Financial Statements give a true and fair view,  
in accordance with the International Financial Reporting 
Standards, of the state of the Group’s affairs as at  
31 December 2011 and of its profit for the year then ended.
•	 The Group Financial Statements have been properly prepared 
in accordance with the Companies (Jersey) Law 1991.
Matters on which we are required to report by exception
We have nothing to report in respect of the following;
Under the Companies (Jersey) Law 1991 we are required to report 
to you if, in our opinion:
•	 proper accounting records have not been kept, or proper 
returns adequate for our audit have not been received from 
branches not visited by us; or
•	 the financial statements are not in agreement with the 
accounting records and returns; or
•	 we have not received all the information and explanations we 
require for our audit.
Under the Listing Rules we are required to review the part of the 
Corporate Governance Statement relating to the company’s 
compliance with the nine provisions of the UK Corporate 
Governance Code specified for our review.

notes to the consolidated financial statements
1. Corporate information
Kentz Corporation Limited (the Company) is a limited liability company registered in Jersey (registered number 58549) under the 
Companies (Jersey) law 1991 and is the holding company for the Kentz Group.
The Group’s principal activity is the provision of engineering and construction services, principally in the oil services sector.
The Consolidated Financial Statements of Kentz Corporation Limited for the year ended 31 December 2011 were authorised for issue in 
accordance with a resolution of the Directors on 10 April 2012.
2. Significant accounting policies
(a) Statement of compliance
The Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) and its 
interpretations adopted by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB).
(b) Basis of preparation
The Financial Statements are presented in US$, rounded to the nearest thousand which represents the functional currency of the Group, 
as it is the currency of the primary economic environment in which the Group operates. Foreign operations are consolidated in 
accordance with the policies set out in note e(iii) below.
The financial statements are prepared on the historical cost basis except that financial instruments held for trading are recorded at their 
fair value. 
The preparation of Financial Statements in conformity with IFRS requires management to make judgements, estimates and assumptions 
that affect the application of policies and reported amounts of assets and liabilities, income and expenses. The estimates and associated 
assumptions are based on historical experience and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, 
the results of which form the basis of making the judgements about carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent 
from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates.
The estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the 
period in which the estimate is revised if the revision affects only that period or in the period of the revision and future periods if the 
revision affects both current and future periods.
Judgements made by management in the application of IFRS that have significant effect on the Financial Statements and estimates with 
a significant risk of material adjustment in the next year are discussed in note 33. 
The accounting policies set out below have been applied consistently to all periods presented in these Consolidated Financial Statements 
and in preparing an opening IFRS Statement of Financial Position at 1 January 2004 for the purposes of the transition to IFRS. 
The accounting policies have been applied consistently by Group entities.
(c) Basis of consolidation
(i) Subsidiaries
Subsidiaries are entities controlled by the Company. Control exists when the Company has the power, directly or indirectly, to govern  
the financial and operating policies of an entity so as to obtain benefits from its activities. In assessing control, potential voting rights that 
presently are exercisable or convertible are taken into account. The Financial Statements of subsidiaries are included in the Consolidated 
Financial Statements from the date that control commences until the date that control ceases. See note 31. 
(ii) Acquisition accounting policy
The consolidated financial statements incorporate the results of business combinations using the purchase method. In the statement  
of financial position, the acquiree’s identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities are initially recognised at their fair values at the 
acquisition date. The results of acquired operations are included in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income from the date 
on which control is obtained. They are deconsolidated from the date control ceases.
(iii) Joint ventures
A joint venture is a contractual arrangement whereby two or more parties undertake an economic activity that is subject to joint control. 
Joint control is the contractually agreed sharing of control such that significant operating and financial decisions require the consent of 
more than one venturer. The Group has two types of joint ventures:
– Jointly controlled entities and
– Jointly controlled operations
A jointly controlled entity is an entity over whose activities the Group has joint control, established by contractual agreement. The results, 
assets and liabilities of a jointly controlled entity are incorporated in these Consolidated Financial Statements using the equity method  
of accounting.
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS KENTZ CORPORATION LTD ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2011 WWW.KENTZ.COM 72
2. Significant accounting policies (continued)
A jointly controlled operation involves the use of assets and other resources of the Group and other venturers rather than the 
establishment of a corporation, partnership or other entity. The Group’s proportionate interest in the assets, liabilities, revenue, expenses 
and cash flows of jointly controlled operations are incorporated into the Group’s Financial Statements under the appropriate headings.
(iv) Non-controlling interest
Non-controlling interests in subsidiaries consolidated by the Group are disclosed separately from the Group’s Equity in the Consolidated 
Statement of Financial Position and in the Consolidated Income Statement.
(v) Transactions eliminated on consolidation
Intra-Group balances and any unrealised gains and losses or income and expenses arising from the intra-Group transactions are 
eliminated in preparing the Consolidated Financial Statements. Unrealised gains arising from transactions with associates and jointly 
controlled entities are eliminated to the extent of the Group’s interest in the entity. Unrealised losses are eliminated in the same way as 
unrealised gains, but only to the extent that there is no evidence of impairment. 
(d) International Financial Reporting Standards not yet effective
Set out below are new accounting standards and interpretations which will be applicable going forward. None are expected to have a 
significant effect on the results of the operation.

All other new standards, interpretations and amendments, which are effective for periods beginning after 1 January 2011 and which have 
not been adopted early, are expected to have an immaterial effect on the Group’s future financial statements.
(e) Foreign currency
(i) Functional presentation currency
Items included in the Financial Statements of each of the Group’s entities are measured using the currency of the primary economic 
environment in which the respective entity operates (“the functional currency”). The Consolidated Financial Statements are presented in 
US Dollars, which is the Group’s presentation currency.
(ii) Foreign currency transactions
Transactions in foreign currencies are translated at the foreign exchange rate ruling at the date of the transaction. Monetary assets and 
liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are re-translated to US$ at the foreign exchange rate ruling at the Statement of Financial 
Position date. Foreign exchange differences arising on translation are recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement. Non-monetary 
assets and liabilities that are measured in terms of historical costs in a foreign currency are translated using the exchange rate at the date 
of the transaction. Non-monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies that are stated at fair value are translated to US$ 
at foreign exchange rates ruling at the dates the fair value was determined.
(iii) Financial statements of foreign operations
The assets and liabilities of foreign operations, including goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on consolidation, are translated to 
US$ at foreign exchange rates ruling at the Statement of Financial Position date. The results and cash flows of foreign operations are 
translated to US$ at average exchange rates for the year. Foreign exchange differences arising on re-translation are recognised directly  
in a separate component of equity.
Financial statements
notes to the consolidated financial statements continued KENTZ CORPORATION LTD ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2011 73 WWW.KENTZ.COM
2. Significant accounting policies (continued)
(iv) Net investment in foreign operations
Adjustments arising on translation of the results of foreign operations at average rate, and on re-statement of the opening net assets at 
closing rates, are dealt with in a separate translation reserve within equity. On disposal of a foreign operation, accumulated currency 
translation differences are recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement as part of the overall gain or loss on disposal; the 
cumulative currency translation differences arising prior to 1 January 2004 (the translation date to IFRS) have been set to zero for 
ascertaining the gain or loss on disposal of a foreign operation subsequent to that date. Translation differences arising after 1 January 
2004 are presented as a separate component of equity in the foreign currency translation reserve in the Consolidated Statement of 
Financial Position.
(f) Property, plant and equipment
(i) Owned assets
Items of property, plant and equipment are stated at cost, as deemed cost, less accumulated depreciation (see below) and impairment 
losses (see accounting policy m). 
Certain items of property, plant and equipment which had been revalued to fair value on or prior to 1 January 2004, the date of transition 
to IFRS, are measured on the basis of deemed costs, being the revalued amount at the date of that revaluation.
(ii) Leased assets
Leases in terms of which the Group assumes substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership are classified as finance leases.  
The Group has entered into various operating leases, the payments for which are recognised as an expense in the Consolidated  
Income Statement on a straight-line basis over the lease terms (see accounting policy t).
(iii) Depreciation
Depreciation is charged to the Income Statement on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of each part of an item of 
property, plant and equipment at the following rates:
Buildings 10%
Plant and fixtures 10%–100%
Motor vehicles 20%–100%
The residual value, if not insignificant, is re-assessed annually.
(g) Goodwill and intangible assets 
(i) Goodwill
Goodwill represents the excess of the cost of an acquisition of a subsidiary or joint venture, over the Group’s interest in the fair value of 
the identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities recognised at the date of acquisition. 
Goodwill on the acquisition of subsidiaries and joint ventures is presented separately in the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position. 
Goodwill is tested annually for impairment, or more frequently when there is an indication that the goodwill may be impaired and carried at 
cost less accumulated impairment losses, if any. Impairment losses previously recognised cannot be reversed (see accounting policy m).
(ii) Other intangible assets
Other intangible assets that are acquired by the Group are stated at cost less accumulated amortisation (see below) and impairment 
losses (see accounting policy m).
Expenditure on internally generated goodwill and brands is recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement as an expense as incurred.
(iii) Amortisation
Goodwill and intangible assets with an indefinite useful life are not amortised. However, they are systematically tested for impairment at 
each Statement of Financial Position date. 
(h) Trade and other receivables
Trade and other receivables are stated at their cost less impairment losses (see accounting policy m).
(i) Long-term contract work in progress
Amounts recoverable on construction contracts, which are included in trade and other receivables, are stated at the net sales value of the 
work done less amounts received as progress payments on account. Cumulative costs incurred, net of amounts transferred to cost of 
sales, after deducting foreseeable losses and progress payments on account not matched with revenue, are included as construction 
contract balances within inventories. Where the progress billings exceed the sum of costs incurred and recognised profit or recognised 
loss, the balance is shown under trade and other payables.
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS KENTZ CORPORATION LTD ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2011 WWW.KENTZ.COM 74
2. Significant accounting policies (continued)
(j) Financial assets
All financial assets are initially measured at fair value, including transaction costs, except for those financial assets classified as at fair 
value through profit or loss which are initially measured at fair value, excluding transaction costs. Where the effect on fair value at initial 
recognition of any extended payment terms is not material, no adjustments were made.
The fair value of a financial instrument on initial recognition is normally the transaction price, unless the fair value is evident from 
observable market data.
Subsequent measurement for financial assets is set out below.
Loans and receivables
Trade and other receivables (excluding Value Added Taxation, pre-payments and operating lease receivables), loans and cash and cash 
equivalents that have fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an active market are classified as loans and receivables.
Loans and receivables are subsequently measured at amortised cost, using the effective interest rate method less any impairment loss. 
Interest income is recognised in profit or loss by applying the effective interest rate, except for short-term trade receivables where the 
recognition of interest would be immaterial. Trade receivables are carried at original invoice amount less any impairment loss.
The accounting policy for bank and cash balances is dealt with under cash and cash equivalents set out below.
Trade receivables are carried at anticipated realisable value. An estimate is made for doubtful receivables based on a review of all 
outstanding amounts at the year end. Bad debts are written off during the year in which they are identified.
De-recognition of financial assets
The Group de-recognises a financial asset only when the contractual rights to the cash flows from the asset expire or it transfers the 
financial asset and substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of the asset to another entity.
(k) Financial liabilities
All financial liabilities are initially measured at fair value, including transaction costs, except for those financial liabilities classified as at fair 
value through profit or loss, which are initially measured at fair value, excluding transaction costs. 
Subsequent measurement for financial liabilities is set out below.
Other financial liabilities not measured at fair value through profit or loss
Other financial liabilities are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method, with interest expense 
recognised on an effective yield basis, except for short-term payables where the recognition of interest would be immaterial.
The effective interest method is a method of calculating the amortised cost of a financial liability and of allocating interest expense over 
the relevant period. The effective interest rate is the rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash payments through the expected life 
of the financial liabilities or, where appropriate, a shorter period.
De-recognition of financial liabilities
The Group de-recognises financial liabilities when, and only when, the Group’s obligations are discharged, cancelled or expired. On 
de-recognition, the difference between the carrying amount of the financial liability, including related unamortised costs, and settlement 
amount paid are included in profit or loss.
(l) Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash balances and call deposits. Bank overdrafts that are repayable on demand and form an integral 
part of the Group’s cash management are included as a component of cash and cash equivalents for the purpose of the Statement of 
Cash Flows. Bank overdrafts are included in interest bearing loans and borrowings in the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position.
Financial statements
notes to the consolidated financial statements continued KENTZ CORPORATION LTD ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2011 75 WWW.KENTZ.COM
2. Significant accounting policies (continued)
(m) Impairment
The carrying amounts of the Group’s assets, other than inventories and deferred tax assets (see accounting policy u(ii)), are reviewed at 
each Statement of Financial Position date to determine whether there is any indication of impairment. If any such indication exists, the 
asset’s recoverable amount is estimated.
For goodwill, assets that have an indefinite useful life and intangible assets that are not yet available for use, the recoverable amount is 
estimated at each Statement of Financial Position date. 
An impairment loss is recognised whenever the carrying amount of an asset of its cash-generating unit exceeds its recoverable amount. 
Impairment losses are recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement.
Impairment losses recognised in respect of cash-generating units are allocated first to reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill 
allocated to cash-generating units (group of units) and then, to reduce the carrying amount of the other assets in the unit (group of units) 
on a pro rata basis. 
Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets were tested for impairment at 1 January 2004, the date of transition to IFRS, even though 
no indication of impairment existed. 
When a decline in the fair value of an available-for-sale financial asset has been recognised directly in equity and there is objective 
evidence that the asset is impaired, the cumulative loss that had been recognised directly in equity is recognised in profit or loss even 
though the financial asset has not been de-recognised. The amount of the cumulative loss that is recognised in profit or loss is the 
difference between the acquisition cost and current fair value, less any impairment loss on that financial asset previously recognised  
in profit or loss. 
(n) Dividends
Dividends are recognised as a liability in the Group’s Financial Statements in the period in which they are declared by the Company.  
In the case of final dividends, this is when approved by the shareholders at the AGM. 
(o) Employee benefits
(i) Defined contribution plans
Obligations for contributions to defined contribution pension plans are recognised as an expense in the Consolidated Income Statement 
as incurred.
(ii) Defined benefit plans
The Group’s net obligation in respect of the defined benefit pension plan is calculated by estimating the amount of future benefit that 
employees have earned in return for their service in the current and prior periods; that benefit is discounted to determine its present value, 
and the fair value of any plan assets is deducted. The discount rate is the yield at the Statement of Financial Position date on high quality 
corporate bonds that have maturity dates approximating to the terms of the Group’s obligations. The calculation is performed by a 
qualified actuary using the projected unit credit method. The excess of scheme liabilities over scheme assets is included in the Statement 
of Financial Position under non-current liabilities. The increase in the present value of the liabilities of the scheme expected to arise from 
employee service (current service cost) in the period is charged to operating profit. The expected return on the scheme’s assets and the 
increase during the period of the scheme’s liabilities, arising from the passage of time, are included as other finance income/costs.
Actuarial gains and losses arising subsequent to the transition to IFRS are recognised in full in the Statement of Comprehensive Income.
When the benefits of a plan are improved, the portion of the increased benefit relating to past service by employees is recognised as an 
expense in the Consolidated Income Statement on a straight-line basis over the average period until the benefits become vested. To the 
extent that the benefits vest immediately, the expense is recognised immediately in the Consolidated Income Statement. 
Where the calculation results in a benefit to the Group, the recognised asset is limited to the net total of any unrecognised and past 
service costs and the present value of any future refunds from the plan or reductions in future contributions to the plan. 
A full actuarial valuation is carried out every three years. The last actuarial valuation was performed on 1 May 2010. 
(iii) Share-based payments
Where equity settled share options are awarded to employees, the fair value of the options at the date of grant is charged to the 
Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income over the vesting period. Non-market vesting conditions are taken into account by 
adjusting the number of equity instruments expected to vest at each reporting date so that, ultimately, the cumulative amount recognised 
over the vesting period is based on the number of options granted. As long as all other vesting conditions are satisfied, a charge is made 
irrespective of whether the market vesting conditions are satisfied. 
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS KENTZ CORPORATION LTD ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2011 WWW.KENTZ.COM 76
2. Significant accounting policies (continued)
The cumulative expense is not adjusted for failure to achieve a market vesting condition or where a non-vesting condition is not satisfied. 
Where the terms and conditions of options are modified before they vest, the increase in the fair value of the options, measured 
immediately before and after the modification, is also charged to the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income over the 
remaining vesting period.
(p) Provisions
A provision is recognised in the Statement of Financial Position when the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result 
of a past event, and it is probable that an outflow of economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation. If the effect is material, 
provisions are determined by discounting the expected future cash flows at a pre-tax rate that reflects current market assessments of the 
time value of money and, where appropriate, the risks specific to the liability. 
(q) Trade and other payables
Trade and other payables are not interest-bearing and are stated at their settlement amount.
(r) Borrowings
Borrowings are recognised initially at proceeds received, net of transaction costs. Subsequent measurement is at amortised cost. 
Finance charges including any premiums payable on settlement are recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement over the period of 
the borrowings using the effective rate of interest method. 
Borrowings are classified as current liabilities unless the Group has an unconditional right to defer settlement of the liability for at least  
12 months after the Statement of Financial Position date.
(s) Revenue recognition
Contract revenue is recognised under the percentage of completion method. When the outcome of the contract can be reliably 
estimated, revenue is recognised by reference to the proportion that accumulated cost of sales up to the year end bear to the estimated 
total costs of the contract. When the contract is at an early stage and its outcome cannot be reliably estimated, revenue is recognised to 
the extent of costs incurred up to the year end which are considered recoverable.
Revenue related to variation orders is recognised when it is probable that the customer will approve the variation and the amount of 
revenue arising from the variation can be reliably measured.
A claim is recognised as contract revenue when settled or when negotiations have reached an advanced stage such that it is probable 
that the customer will accept the claim and the amount that it is probable will be accepted by the customer can be measured reliably. 
Losses on contracts are assessed on an individual contract basis and provision is made for the full amount of the anticipated losses, 
including any losses relating to future work on a contract, in the period in which the loss is first foreseen. 
(t) Expenses
(i) Operating lease payments
Payments made under operating leases are recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement on a straight-line basis over the term of 
the lease. Lease incentives received are recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement as an integral part of the total lease expense.
(ii) Finance lease payments
Minimum lease payments are apportioned between the finance charge and the reduction of the outstanding liability. The finance charge is 
allocated to each period during the lease term so as to produce a constant periodic rate of interest on the remaining balance of the 
liability.
(iii) Net financing costs
Net financing costs comprise interest payable on borrowings, calculated using the effective interest rate method, interest receivable on 
funds invested and dividend income.
Interest income is recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement as it accrues, using the effective interest method. Dividend income 
is recognised in the Income Statement on the date the entity’s right to receive payments is established which, in the case of quoted 
securities, is usually the ex-dividend date. The interest expense component of finance lease payments is recognised in the Consolidated 
Income Statement using the effective interest rate method.
Financial statements
notes to the consolidated financial statements continued KENTZ CORPORATION LTD ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2011 77 WWW.KENTZ.COM
2. Significant accounting policies (continued)
(u) Income tax
Income tax on the profit or loss for the year comprises current and deferred tax. Income tax is recognised in the Consolidated Income 
Statement except to the extent that it relates to items recognised directly in equity, in which case it is recognised in equity. 
(i) Current tax
Current tax is the expected tax payable on the taxable income for the year, using tax rates enacted or substantially enacted at the 
Statement of Financial Position date, and any adjustment to tax payable in respect of previous years.
(ii) Deferred tax
Deferred tax is recognised on temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting 
purposes and for the amounts used for taxation purposes. The following temporary differences are not provided for: goodwill not 
deductible for tax purposes, the initial recognition of assets or liabilities that affect neither accounting nor taxable profit, differences 
relating to investment in subsidiaries to the extent that they will probably not reverse in the foreseeable future. The amount of deferred  
tax provided is based on the expected manner of realisation or settlement of the carrying amount of assets and liabilities, using tax  
rates enacted or substantively enacted at the Statement of Financial Position date. 
A deferred tax asset is recognised only to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which the asset 
can be utilised. Deferred tax assets are reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that the related tax benefit will be realised. 
Additional income taxes that arise from the distribution of dividends are recognised at the same time as the liability to pay the  
related dividend. 
(v) Share capital
Financial instruments issued by the Group are classified as equity only to the extent that they do not meet the definition of a financial 
liability or financial asset.
The Group’s ordinary shares are classified as equity instruments.
(w) Treasury shares
Consideration paid for the purchase of treasury shares is recognised directly in equity. The cost of treasury shares held is presented as a 
separate reserve (the ‘treasury share reserve’).
3. Segmental reporting 
Segment information is presented in respect of the Group’s geographical and business segments. The primary format, geographical 
segments, is based on the Group’s management and internal reporting structure.
Segment results, assets and liabilities include items directly attributable to a segment as well as those that can be allocated on a 
reasonable basis. Unallocated items comprise mainly income-earning assets and revenue, interest-bearing loans, borrowings and 
expenses, and corporate assets and expenses. 
Segment capital expenditure is the total cost incurred during the period to acquire segment assets that are expected to be used for more 
than one period.
(i) Geographical segments 
The Group manages its business on a worldwide basis by organising its activities into six distinct regions. The geographical areas are:
•	 Middle East
•	 Far East
•	 Africa
•	 Australasia
•	 Americas
•	 Europe
Europe includes all costs associated with the Group’s administrative function.
In presenting the information on the basis of geographical segments, segment revenue and segment assets are based on the 
geographical location of assets.

22. Financial Instruments
The principal objective of the Group’s treasury policy is to ensure that there are sufficient resources to finance the business. The cash 
resources of the Group are retained in a combination of central and local bank accounts. These accounts comprise current, call and 
short-term deposits with banks approved by the Board. Financial instruments held by the Group principally comprise financing facilities, 
cash and other items including receivables and payables, all of which arise directly from its operations.
The risks arising from these financial instruments are liquidity risk, interest rate risk and foreign exchange rate risk. The Board reviews, 
agrees and monitors policies for managing each of these risks; these are summarised below. These policies have remained unchanged 
during the period under review. 
(a) Liquidity risk
Group cash resources held at banks are monitored regularly by senior management (locally and at Group level). It is the Group’s policy  
to keep sufficient funds in current and call accounts to meet short-term needs. Surplus funds are retained on short-term interest-bearing 
deposits. At the Statement of Financial Position date there were no significant concentrations of credit risk. The maximum exposure to 
credit risk is represented by the carrying amount of each financial asset. The Group also maintains overdraft facilities in certain entities.
(b) Interest rate risk
The financial assets of the Group comprise trade and other receivables and cash and cash equivalents. The trade and other receivables 
are non-interest-bearing. The cash and cash equivalents earn interest at floating rates based on individual bank market rates for the 
relevant currencies and durations.
The Group’s exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to bank loans and amounts payable under asset 
finance leases.

Interest rate sensitivity analysis
The impact on the Group’s pre-tax profit due to a possible change in interest rates on loans and asset finance leases at the reporting date 
is demonstrated below:
2011
US$’000
2010
US$’000
+1% movement (270) (138)
(c) Foreign currency risk
The Financial Statements are prepared in US$, rounded to the nearest thousand which represents the functional currency of the Group 
as it is the currency of the primary economic environment in which the Group operates. The Group is exposed to foreign currency risk on 
sales, purchases, borrowings and net investments in subsidiaries that are denominated in a currency other than the US$. The principal 
currencies giving rise to this risk are Australian Dollar, South African Rand, United Arab Emirates Dirham, Saudi Riyal, Qatari Riyal, Kuwaiti 
Dinar, Euro, Russian Rouble, Canadian Dollar, Botswana Pula, Mozambique Metical and Madagascar Ariary.
Exchange rate risk is managed at the subsidiary levels by ensuring that, as far as possible, income and expenses are denominated in the 
appropriate functional currency. Certain subsidiaries enter into forward exchange contracts to hedge the exchange risk of trading and 
intercompany balances in line with Board-approved policy. Those contracts outstanding at the relevant period ends are not designated  
as cash flow, fair value or net investment hedges and are entered into for periods consistent with currency transaction exposures,  
which are short-term in nature with average duration of 14 months as at 31 December 2011.
The Group does not trade in any derivative financial instruments.
Exchange rate sensitivity analysis
The following table demonstrates the sensitivity of profit before tax to selected movements in subsidiary foreign exchange rates (with all 
other variables held constant). The impact on profit before tax is based on a reasonably possible change in US dollar exchange rates with 
respect to different floating exchange rate reporting currencies. The impact on total equity is calculated by changing the exchange rates 
used in measuring the closing balance sheet.
2011
US$’000
2010
US$’000
A 10% rate depreciation in these currencies versus US dollar
Impact on profit before tax (832) (1,842)
Impact on total equity (2,132) (2,671)
(d) Fair values
Forward exchange contracts open at the reporting period ends are marked to market to fair value the contracts.
At 31 December 2011, the Group had foreign exchange contracts outstanding with notional contract values of US$60.2 million and net 
unrealised gains of US$1.5 million.
The estimated fair values of the remaining financial instruments of the Group approximate to their book values as at the relevant period 
ends. The following criteria have been used to assess the fair values of the Group’s financial instruments.
•	 Receivables, cash and cash equivalents and payables are based on their book values due to their short maturity period.
•	 Loans are based on their book values which represents the Directors’ opinion of their fair values.
The fair value of the Group’s lease obligations approximates their carrying amounts.
As the Group’s financing facilities bear interest at floating rates, which represent prevailing market rate, the Directors consider the carrying 
amount of these borrowings approximates their fair value. 
The Directors estimate the fair value of the amounts due to/from related companies approximates to the carrying value.

23. Deferred tax asset/liabilities
Deferred tax is calculated in full on temporary differences under the liability method using tax rates applicable in the various jurisdictions 
in which the Group operates. The movement on the deferred tax account is as shown below:

25. Employee benefits
The following pension schemes operate in the Group.
(a) Irish administered defined benefit scheme
The Group operates a defined benefit pension plan for certain of its General and Professional Staff. On 31 December 2010, this defined 
benefit pension scheme was closed for future service accrual. Existing members have been invited to join a new company defined 
contribution scheme with effect from 1 January 2011.
The defined benefit pension plan is administered by independent trustees and is managed externally by independent investment managers. 
The pension charge in the Consolidated Income Statement is calculated so as to spread the cost of pension provision over the 
employees’ expected working lives with the Group. The pension cost is determined in accordance with the advice of qualified actuaries, 
using the Attained Age method. An actuarial valuation was prepared for the General and Professional Staff Plan effective 1 May 2010.
The assumptions which most significantly affect the level of pension costs are those relating to the rate of return on the underlying 
investments of the plan and the rate of increase in salaries and pensions. The financial assumptions inherent in the actuarial basis 
underlying the plan assumes that the long-term investment return exceeds the rate of increase in pensionable earnings by 2% per annum.
At the date of the most recent actuarial valuation, the market value of the assets held in General and Professional Plan amounted to 
€17,822,000 equivalent to US$23,922,000. The actuarial value of the assets represented 56% of the liability for benefits under the 
valuation method, for service to the valuation date, based on the assumptions used in the actuarial review. The actuarial report is not 
available for public inspection.

27. Contingent liabilities
(a)  Certain banking facilities of the Group and its subsidiaries are secured by various securities, including the assignment of contract 
receivables, the cession of book debtors and corporate guarantees from the Company. The Company together with certain subsidiary 
companies have given corporate guarantees as security for the banking facilities of certain Group companies amounting to  
US$585.4 million.

of their respective terms without being called upon, no provision has been made in the financial statements in respect of these contingent 
liabilities and the Directors do not believe that the Group will incur any liability arising from the issuance of these guarantees.

32. Acquisition during the year 
On 1 February 2011, Kentz Pty Limited acquired 100% of the share capital of RNE Engineering & Projects (Pty) Limited (RNE) in South 
Africa for a total cash consideration of South African Rand 73 million (approximately US$10 million).  
RNE undertakes project management, engineering and design services including process, mechanical, piping, civil and structural 
engineering for oil, gas and petrochemical process plants. The acquisition will support the growth of activity in South Africa as well as the 
opportunity to jointly tender for select Engineering, Procurement and Construction (EPC) contracts.
Details of the fair value of identifiable assets and liabilities acquired, purchase consideration and goodwill are as follows:
In thousands of USD Fair value
Property, plant and equipment 463
Intangible assets 1,687
Inventories 380
Receivables 934
Cash and cash equivalents 723
Payables (295)
Deferred tax liability (552)
3,340
Fair value of consideration paid:
Cash paid 5,680
Deferred consideration (at net present cost) 4,875
Contingent consideration (3,203)
Total consideration 7,352
Goodwill 4,012
The acquisitions costs have been charged to administrative expenses in the consolidated income statement for the year ended  
31 December 2011.
The contingent consideration is payable should RNE meet performance targets for the financial years ending 31 December 2011 to  
31 December 2013. A portion of the purchase consideration will be forfeited if the selling shareholders were to leave RNE before  
31 December 2013. The portion of the consideration relating to this is amortised over the three year period in accordance with IAS 19 
Employee Benefits. The liability for the remaining deferred consideration recognised at the acquisition date is measured at the fair value  
of the obligation at that date. Differences on the remeasurement of this liability are recognised in profit or loss.
On an undiscounted basis, the total future payments for which the Group may be liable range from US$1.9 million to US$5.1 million.
The main factors leading to the recognition of goodwill are the value of expected synergies arising from the acquisition.
The goodwill recognised will not be deductible for tax purposes.
From the date of acquisition, RNE has contributed US$8.7 million to revenues and US$2.2 million to PBT of the Group.
If the acquisition had taken place on 1 January 2011, revenues would have been US$1,368.5 million and PBT for the Group would have 
been US$79.7 million.
Financial statements
notes to the consolidated financial statements continued KENTZ CORPORATION LTD ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2011 101 WWW.KENTZ.COM 101 WWW.KENTZ.COM
33. Critical accounting estimates and judgements
Management makes estimates and judgements, including assumptions concerning the future. Estimates and judgements are continually 
evaluated and are based on historical experience and other factors, including expectations of future events that are believed to be 
reasonable in the circumstances.
The resulting accounting estimates will, by definition, seldom equal the related actual results. The estimates and assumptions that have  
a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial year are  
as follows.
Revenue recognition
The Group uses the percentage-of-completion method in accounting for its contract revenue. Use of the percentage-of-completion 
method requires management to estimate the stage of completion of a contract to date as a proportion of the total contract work to be 
performed in accordance with the accounting policy set out in note 2(s). As a result, Kentz Group management is required to estimate the 
total cost to completion of all outstanding jobs at each period end. 
Income taxes
The Group is subject to income taxes in numerous jurisdictions. Significant judgement is required in determining the worldwide provision 
for income taxes. There are many transactions and calculations for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. The Group 
recognises liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues based on estimates of whether additional taxes will be due. Where the final tax 
outcome of these matters is different from the amounts that were initially recorded, such differences will impact the current and deferred 
income tax assets and liabilities in the period in which such determination is made.
Pension benefits
The present value of the pension obligations depends on a number of factors that are determined on an actuarial basis using a number of 
assumptions. The assumptions used in determining the net cost (income) for pensions include the discount rate. Any changes in these 
assumptions will impact the carrying amount of pension obligations. In determining the appropriate discount rate, the Group considers 
the interest rates of high quality corporate bonds that are denominated in the currency in which the benefits will be paid, and that have 
terms to maturity approximating the terms of the related pension liability. Other key assumptions for pension obligations are based in part 
on current market conditions. Additional information is disclosed in note 25.
34. Events after the reporting period
a) Final dividend
The Directors have proposed a final dividend of 7.3 US$ cents per share which would make a total dividend payment of 12.3 US$ cents 
per share for the year ended 31 December 2011. The final dividend payment will be made in May 2012 to shareholders on the register at 
the close of business on 27 April 2012.
b) Kerbet Limited
On 4 April 2012, Kerbet Limited disposed of 15 million shares in the Company representing 12.89% of the issued share capital by way of 
a secondary placing.

Introduction
The 13 month period to 31 January 2007 
saw considerable changes to the group, 
primarily with the appointment of Paul Carvell 
as chief executive officer. One of the first 
actions undertaken at this time was to conduct 
a strategic review of the business which focused 
on sustaining long term proﬁtable growth. In 
order to carry out the agreed strategy, we went 
to the market to raise additional funding, 
resulting in an additional £3m investment from 
shareholders. We should not forget that all 
of this happened alongside the day-to-day 
running of the business and during the period 
under review I am pleased to report that the 
group has continued to expand with signiﬁcant 
growth in the ParcelXchange business and 
signiﬁcant investment in Two-Man and 
Technical in our Specialist division.
Financial review
Turnover for the 13 month period totalled 
£15.95m (2005: £13.51m) and gross proﬁt was 
£5.45m (2005: £3.74m), a gross margin of 
34.2% (2005: 27.7%).
The operating loss was £1.69m (2005: £2.38m). 
After an exceptional charge of £0.42m (2005: 
£0.46m) in connection with moving the T eddington 
ﬁnance department to Rugby and reorganising 
the business to reﬂect the needs of its redeﬁned 
strategy, the loss before interest and tax totalled 
£2.11m (2005: £2.83m). With an interest charge 
of £0.29m (2005: £0.16m), the loss before and 
after tax amounted to £2.40m (2005: £2.98m). 
The basic loss per share was 6.7p (2005: 9.5p).
Adding back the exceptional charge 
of £0.42m (2005: £0.46m) and goodwill 
amortisation of £0.12m (2005: £0.10m), 
the adjusted loss before tax was £1.86m 
(2005: £2.42m), a 33.1% improvement, 
and the adjusted loss per share was 5.2p 
(2005: 7.7p). The adjusted LBITDA amounted 
to £1.11m (2005: £1.92m).
At the year end, net debt totalled £2.0m 
(2005: £4.0m) and net assets were £3.0m 
(2005: £1.4m), the balance sheet having been 
considerably strengthened by the placing on 
8 January 2007. At this time, Business Direct 
issued 100,000,000 new ordinary shares of 
1p at 3p per share, raising £2.7m of net funds 
after expenses of £0.3m. At the same time, 
£945,000 of preference shares were converted 
into 31,500,000 new ordinary shares of 1p. 
T o facilitate the placing, each ordinary share 
of 5p was converted into one new ordinary 
share of 1p and one deferred share of 4p. 
The deferred shares have no value. 
In addition, the group agreed a series 
of amendments to its banking facilities 
with the Bank of Scotland. As part of the 
new arrangements, the repayment date 
of the term loan of £2.5m was put back by 12 
months to 2011, and the ﬁnancial covenants 
were amended to reﬂect the group’s revised 
business plan. 
Business review
ParcelXchange Division
During the period under review, there was 
continued growth in the ParcelXchange 
network. The number of ParcelXchanges in 
the ﬁeld increased to 300, meaning that the 
actual number of lockers now exceeds 4,000. 
Occupancy also increased over last year 
from 39% to 51% and we intend to grow 
this further in the current year. 
Although we have halted the lost business 
we suffered in the first half on In Boot 
and offset those losses by new business on 
Direct Vendor Trunking, overall turnover for this 
area was static when compared to last year.

Russell Hodgson Chairman
The 13 month period to 
31 January 2007 saw 
considerable changes

with the appointment 
of Paul Carvell as 
chief executive ofﬁcer.
I am pleased to report 
that the group has 
continued to expand.
_1_BUS_ar06_front.indd   2 06/06/2007   16:11:33 03 Business Direct Group plc Annual report and ﬁnancial statements 06/07
Specialist Division
The additional investment made in our 
T wo Man Delivery and T echnical Service offerings 
resulted in substantial growth and we view 
these as key components in the portfolio of 
services the Specialist Division provides. The 
results for our Sameday/Next day Delivery 
and Partsbank Divisions, which trade principally 
in the Northern Home Counties, were 
disappointing. This is a very price sensitive 
market and trading conditions are challenging 
for all those within it. However, having undergone 
a thorough review and replaced less proﬁtable 
accounts with more proﬁtable ones, we are 
conﬁdent that we can once again grow 
revenues and proﬁts in these areas.
Board changes
During the period under review, there have 
been signiﬁcant changes to the make-up 
of the group’s board.
Carl Wylde resigned from the board in 
January 2006. In June 2006 Paul Carvell 
joined the group, replacing Paul Keane, as 
non-executive chairman. At the same time, 
the board appointed Derek O’Neill as 
group ﬁnance director and David Whittaker 
as operations director.
In September 2006, Paul Carvell assumed the 
full time role of chief executive ofﬁcer, replacing 
Tim Houston who stepped down to concentrate 
on the significant opportunities presented 
by global licensing of ParcelXchange.
Following a period of consultancy, I joined 
the group in January 2007 as chairman, 
having previously held a number of key roles 
in public companies in the logistics industry.
At the end of January 2007, Wayne Crew 
also stepped down from the board, remaining 
responsible for ParcelXchange sales.
In March 2007, having been a key person in 
securing the additional funding, Derek O’Neill 
decided he needed to concentrate on his 
other business interests, and took a position 
as joint managing director with a recruitment 
services company. He has been replaced 
by Martin Wright, who has held a number of 
senior ﬁnancial roles in blue chip companies. 
Martin was already working in the group 
overseeing the transfer of the ﬁnance function 
from Teddington to Rugby.
David Whitaker also stepped down from the 
board in March 2007 and has been replaced by 
Martyn Wilson who assumes the role of managing 
director of our Specialist Divison. Martyn has 
many years’ experience in the Sameday/Next 
day/T echnical arena and was previously managing 
director of UK T oday, a major courier company, 
and prior to that held senior posts in TNT , 
developing its sameday network.
I would like to take this opportunity to thank 
the previous directors for their past contribution, 
to welcome the new team and wish them all 
every success in the future.
Employees
I would also like to thank all of our staff, without 
whose contribution the progress made would 
not be possible. Their enthusiasm for the 
business is reflected in the significant 
shareholdings held by them, and I am pleased 
to announce that in the current year we will 
be launching a sharesave scheme for which 
all levels of staff will be eligible.
Prospects
The ongoing success of the ParcelXchange 
concept in the domestic market and the vast 
opportunities of global licensing, together 
with the signiﬁcant growth opportunities in 
Specialist, give me great confidence that 
Business Direct Group’s prospects are 
excellent. Whilst not underestimating the 
challenges ahead, I feel sure that we now 
have the right people, structure and focus 
for this business to achieve its full potential.

Introduction
The 13 month period to 31 January 2007 was 
particularly busy, with significant changes 
to the structure and direction of the business 
and its management team.
Following my appointment as chief executive ofﬁcer 
in September, I instigated a Strategic Review 
to determine the direction of the business 
over the next three years. At the same time, 
we undertook a round of fundraising to restructure 
our ﬁnances and to provide the backing for 
our new strategy. Finally, towards the end of 
the period, there were several management 
changes at board level.
Business review
Business Direct is a specialist provider of 
logistics solutions for the computer, electrical 
and field services engineer market. Since 
January 2007, it has been organised into two 
Divisions, ParcelXchange and Specialist, 
reflecting the conclusion of my Strategic 
Review to concentrate on those two areas.
In order to carry out this strategy successfully, 
we realised we needed to restructure the ﬁnances 
of the business and so in October we undertook 
a series of presentations to current and potential 
investors. As a result we were successful in raising 
an additional £3m of investment and, at the same 
time, restructuring our long term borrowings.
ParcelXchange
The ParcelXchange Division comprises 
ParcelXchange, direct engineer delivery 
(“In-Boot”) and direct vendor trunking/delivery 
to forward stock locations (“FSLs”), providing 
logistics solutions for the ﬁnal mile delivery. 
It has a blue chip client base and partnerships 
with global supply chain companies, such as 
DHL/Exel and TNT . A European inbound freight 
solution and a national P .U.D.O. network (manned 
Pick Up Drop Off points) will be launched later 
this year, enabling us to offer a total In-Night 
solution, giving pre-8 a.m. delivery of UK and 
European freight to the ﬁeld personnel market.
In the 13 month period, the ParcelXchange 
Division turnover totalled £7.52m (2005: £4.58m), 
with ParcelXchange turnover totalling £4.48m 
(2005: £1.70m). 
Business Direct owns a national network 
of award winning ParcelXchanges, providing 
a secure deposit and reverse logistics 
environment, using sophisticated technology 
with end-to-end track-and-trace. The 
ParcelXchanges are typically used to service 
the ﬁeld engineer market, delivering parts 
into a secure locker in a convenient location. 
Customers can rent ParcelXchange lockers 
for a pre-agreed period (“Fixed”) or pay as 
used (“Dynamic”). ParcelXchange represents

the UK’s largest network of intelligent drop boxes 
and the lockers are installed nationwide, normally 
at petrol stations and supermarkets, with an 
average drive time of just 15 minutes from 
an engineer’s home.
The number of ParcelXchanges increased 
to approximately 300 from 280 and the number 
of individual lockers to over 4,000. The occupancy 
rate increased to 51% from 39%.
Since January 2007, Tim Houstoun has 
been focusing on the development of a 
global ParcelXchange leasing business which, 
through collaboration with an asset ﬁnance 
company, it is anticipated this will have no 
adverse effect on the Group’s cash ﬂow. This 
business has the potential to be proﬁtable 
next year.
This summer, Business Direct proposes to 
launch a B2C ParcelXchange product aimed 
at consumers ordering goods online.
In-Boot Delivery and Direct Vendor Trunking
In-Boot is a service that supplies direct into ﬁeld 
engineers’ vehicles during the night and collects 
returned parts, enabling the engineer to reduce 
overall mileage and increase productivity. 
Direct Vendor Trunking is an exclusively managed 
national delivery system which enables 
dedicated delivery and collection to major 
vendors and repair agents on a daily basis.
Overall sales of these services in the year 
were ﬂat. In the ﬁrst Interim announcement of 
28 September 2006, we explained that In-Boot 
business had been lost in the ﬁrst six months 
of the year following substantial price increases. 
These losses were halted in the second half 
and margins improved as a result of the price 
increases. The loss of In-Boot business has 
been offset by increased sales of Direct Vendor 
Trunking services. 
Specialist 
The principal services offered by the 
Specialist Division are Two-Man delivery, 
Same-day Urgent Delivery, national Next-day 
parcel delivery, Technical/Swap-out, and pick 
and pack warehousing.
In the year, Specialist turnover totalled £8.43m 
(2005: £9.07m). 
Two-Man Delivery
Two-Man delivery comprises pre-agreed 
time-speciﬁc delivery of large/high value 
equipment, such as computer rack 
systems, using skilled Two-Man teams 
and specialist vehicles. 
In the year, additional investment was made 
in the number of Two-Man teams and the 
business experienced substantial pro rata 
growth. This is expected to continue to 
be a growth area in the current year.
The number of ParcelXchanges increased to approximately 300 from 280 
and the number of individual lockers to over 4,000. The occupancy rate 
increased to 51% from 39%.

Specialist continued
Same-day Urgent/Next-day Delivery
Same-day urgent and next-day delivery is a 
service trading principally in the northern Home 
Counties out of Business Direct’s Watford depot. 
In the year, the performance of the Same-day 
and Next-day delivery business was disappointing. 
Whilst this is a mature market, management 
believes that good returns are achievable. 
Martyn Wilson, who joined the board on 
28 March 2007, has signiﬁcant experience 
in this area and will be introducing a revenue 
growth programme.
Technical/Swap-out
Technical/Swap-out comprises the delivery 
of substantial volumes of electronic equipment 
to businesses, their on-desk set-up and the 
removal of old product in accordance with 
European legislation. The business also 
carries out line 1/line 2 call out on nationwide 
maintenance agreements. 
The investment in a sales specialist in the summer 
of 2006 is starting to produce positive results. 
This is expected to be a high growth opportunity 
in the current year.
Partsbank
Partsbank is the management of outsourced 
warehousing, comprising pick/pack and 
stock management.
In the year, revenue fell in this area, and efforts 
are underway to replace with higher margin 
opportunities such as strategic stock holding 
for our key clients, close to our national hub, 
allowing late cut-off times for critical parts.
Whilst remaining very conﬁdent in our abilities 
to achieve the proposed strategy, we are not 
unaware that the business faces risk from 
increasing interest rates, rising oil prices and 
competitor activity. However, the risk in relation 
to the latter is lessened by the unique nature 
of the ParcelXchange product, and in particular 
the sophistication of the software, posing 
a signiﬁcant barrier to those wishing to enter 
this arena.
Strategic review
In September, I initiated a Strategic Review to 
determine the direction of the group over the 
next three years. The principal conclusions from 
the review were that there were signiﬁcant growth 
opportunities in the ParcelXchange concept, 
in In-Boot and in the service offerings of the 
Specialist Division.
Chief executive’s review continued
Summary
  A new management team has been introduced to focus the business on achieving 
it’s full potential.
  Continued interest in the ParcelXchange product means increased occupancy 
and increased proﬁtability.
  Exciting new initiatives such as P .U.D.O, European Inbound and B2C will be launched 
in the coming year.
_1_BUS_ar06_front.indd   6 06/06/2007   16:12:44 07 Business Direct Group plc Annual report and ﬁnancial statements 06/07
In the domestic market, the demand for 
ParcelXchanges continues to grow with 
occupancy levels increasing and partnerships 
with major retailers a distinct possibility as 
they begin to appreciate the beneﬁts to the 
consumer of being able to collect purchases 
from convenient locations when they want to. 
Overseas, we identiﬁed opportunities to license 
the ParcelXchange concept to foreign operators 
such as national post ofﬁces, and under the 
stewardship of Tim Houstoun we have already 
made contact with several interested parties. 
Our In-Boot offering is particularly attractive to 
certain traditional industries, e.g. manufacturers 
of agricultural and mechanical handling 
equipment and we are actively exploring this 
as a way to grow proﬁts in this area.
Opportunities identiﬁed for the Specialist Division 
include expanding our T wo-Man Delivery Service 
to other market sectors e.g. Retail. In addition, 
by maintaining our excellent service levels and 
overall delivery standards, we believe we can 
become a major force in this area of expertise.
Prospects
After a period of signiﬁcant change, I am satisﬁed 
that the foundations have been laid to drive this 
business forward to enable it to realise its full 
potential as a leader in its chosen markets.
Summary
We have adopted the “people, service, proﬁt” 
culture, and consequently with the new 
management teams in place are now focused 
on providing exceptional service to our 
customers across the group. We believe 
this will lead to additional business from 
our existing customers who will in turn act 
as advocates for new customers.
I am delighted with progress so far, with our 
in night activities (ParcelXchange and In Boot) 
now performing at near Six Sigma levels 
consistently and Specialist Division fast 
approaching 99% on a daily basis. Whilst 
there is more to be accomplished in both 
divisions, particularly in IT and account 
management, I am conﬁdent that we will soon 
be offering unparalleled levels in the respective 
sectors of the logistics industry.

On 8 January 2007, the directors were empowered at an extraordinary general meeting to allot shares for cash on a basis other than pro rata 
to existing shareholders in certain circumstances. It is proposed that this power should be renewed for a further period until the conclusion 
of the annual general meeting in 2008, and the appropriate special resolution and further details are set out in the notice of annual general meeting. 
Creditor payment policy
It is group policy to agree and clearly communicate the terms of payment as part of the commercial arrangements negotiated with suppliers and 
then to pay according to those terms based upon the timely receipt of an accurate invoice. The company supports the CBI Prompt Payers Code. 
A copy of the code can be obtained from the CBI at Centre Point, 103 New Oxford Street, London WC1A 1DU.
At 31 January 2007, the group had an average of 67 days’ purchases outstanding in trade creditors (2005: 62 days).
Financial instruments
The directors seek to optimise the use of equity and debt funding in the business. Borrowings are at ﬂoating rates and the board considers 
from time to time whether to use appropriate hedging techniques to minimise the group’s exposure to the risk of an increase in these rates. 
At the balance sheet date, no such hedging was in place.
Employee involvement
The group recognises and seeks to encourage the involvement of its employees, with the aim being the recruitment, motivation and retention 
of quality employees throughout the group. An approved and an unapproved share option schemes are in place and operated within the 
Enterprise Management Incentive Scheme.
The group’s employment policies, including the commitment to equal opportunity, are designed to attract, retain and motivate employees 
regardless of sex, race, religion or disability.
The group is committed to ensuring and communicating the requirements for a healthy and safe working environment for all employees, consistent 
with health and safety legislation and, wherever practicable, gives full consideration to applications for employment from disabled persons.
Employee share schemes
The involvement of key employees in the ﬁnancial performance of the group is encouraged through participation in the company’s share option 
schemes, details of which are shown in note 20 on pages 29 and 30.

Principles of corporate governance
The company’s board of directors appreciates the value of good corporate governance not only in the areas of accountability and risk management 
but also as a positive contribution to business prosperity. It believes that corporate governance involves more than a simple “box ticking” approach 
to establish whether a company has met the requirements of a number of speciﬁc rules and regulations. Rather, the issue is one of applying 
corporate governance principles (including those set out in the Corporate Governance Guidelines for AIM companies published by the 
Quoted Companies’ Alliance in July 2005) in a sensible and pragmatic fashion having regard to the individual circumstances of the group’s 
business. The key objective is to enhance and protect shareholder value. 
Board structure 
The board is responsible to shareholders for the proper management of the group. A statement of directors’ responsibilities in respect 
of the accounts is set out on page 19. Brief biographical details of the directors are given on page 9.
The non-executive directors have a particular responsibility to ensure that the strategies proposed by the executive directors are fully considered. 
The non-executive directors are considered by the board to be independent of management and free of any relationship which could materially 
interfere with the exercise of their independent judgement. All non-executives receive a ﬁxed fee for their services.
T o enable the board to discharge its duties, all directors have full and timely access to all relevant information and there is a procedure for all directors, 
in furtherance of their duties, to take independent professional advice, if necessary, at the expense of the group. The board has a formal schedule 
of matters reserved to it and meets ten times a year. It is responsible for overall group strategy, approval of major capital expenditure projects 
and consideration of signiﬁcant ﬁnancing matters. The executive and non-executive directors attended all meetings which they were eligible 
to attend during the period.
The following committees, which have written terms of reference, deal with speciﬁc aspects of the group’s affairs: 
  The remuneration committee is responsible for making recommendations to the board on the company’s framework of executive remuneration 
and its cost. The committee determines the contract terms, remuneration and other beneﬁts for each of the executive directors, including 
performance-related bonus schemes, pension rights and compensation payments. The board itself determines the remuneration of the 
non-executive directors. The committee comprises of two non-executive directors (G R Norfolk and R Hodgson). It is chaired by R Hodgson 
and meets at least twice a year, including immediately before the submission of the annual and interim ﬁnancial statements to the board. 
The report on directors’ remuneration is set out on page 15. 
  The audit committee comprises of two non-executive directors (G R Norfolk and R Hodgson), and is chaired by G R Norfolk. Its prime tasks 
are to review the scope of external audit, to receive regular reports from Baker Tilly, and to review the half yearly and annual accounts before 
they are presented to the board, focusing in particular on accounting policies and areas of management judgement and estimation. 
The committee is responsible for monitoring the controls which are in force to ensure the integrity of the information reported to shareholders. 
The committee acts as a forum for discussion of internal control issues and contributes to the board’s review of the effectiveness of the group’s 
internal control and risk management systems and processes. It advises the board on the appointment of external auditors and on their 
remuneration for both audit and non-audit work, and discusses the nature and scope of the audit with the external auditors. It reviews and 
monitors the independence of the auditors, especially with regard to non-audit work. The audit committee met three times during the period 
to consider the reports of the auditors immediately before submission of the interim ﬁnancial information, prior to the commencement of 
the audit and immediately prior to the submission of the annual ﬁnancial statements to the board.
  The nomination committee was formed at the end of the ﬁnancial year and comprises two of the non-executive directors (R Hodgson and 
G Norfolk). The committee will consider all appointees before they are offered roles on the board of the company. Appointments are made 
after an evaluation of the skills, knowledge and expertise required to ensure that the board as a whole has the ability to ensure that the 
group can continue to compete effectively in its market place.

_BUS_ar06_back.indd   4 06/06/2007   16:13:28 14 Business Direct Group plc Annual report and ﬁnancial statements 06/07
Internal control 
The directors are responsible for the group’s system of internal control and reviewing its effectiveness. The board has designed the group’s 
system of internal control in order to provide the directors with reasonable assurance that its assets are safeguarded, that transactions are 
authorised and properly recorded and that material errors and irregularities are either prevented or would be detected within a timely period. 
However, no system of internal control can eliminate the risk of failure to achieve business objectives or provide absolute assurance against 
material misstatement or loss. 
The key elements of the control system in operation are:
  the board meets regularly with a formal schedule of matters reserved to it for decision and has put in place an organisational structure 
with clear lines of responsibility deﬁned and with appropriate delegation of authority; and
  there are procedures for planning, approval and monitoring of capital expenditure and information systems for monitoring the group’s 
ﬁnancial performance against approved budgets and forecasts.
The process adopted by the group accords with the guidance contained in the document “Internal Control Guidance for directors on the 
“Combined Code” issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of England and Wales.
The audit committee will receive reports from the external auditors on a regular basis and from executive directors of the group. During the year, 
the audit committee has reviewed the effectiveness of the system of internal control as described above. The board receives periodic reports 
from all committees.
There are no signiﬁcant issues disclosed in the report and ﬁnancial statements for the period ended 31 January 2007 and up to the date 
of approval of the report and ﬁnancial statements that have required the board to deal with any related material internal control issues.
The board has considered whether the group’s internal controls processes would be signiﬁcantly enhanced by an internal audit function 
and has taken the view that, at the group’s current stage of development, this is not a necessity. The board will continue to review this matter 
each year.
Relations with shareholders 
The group values its dialogue with both institutional and private investors. Effective two-way communication with the investment community 
is actively pursued and this encompasses issues such as performance, policy and strategy. During the year, the directors had meetings with 
actual and potential investors and they will continue to do so on a regular basis. 
There is also an opportunity, at the company’s annual general meeting, for individual shareholders to raise general business matters with the 
full board, and notice of the company’s annual general meeting is circulated to all shareholders at least 20 working days before such meeting. 
The chairmen of the audit and remuneration committees will be available at the annual general meeting to answer questions.
The annual report is to be published on the company’s website, which also includes previous ﬁnancial reports and other announcements made 
during the period.
Going concern 
The directors conﬁrm that they are satisﬁed that the company and the group have adequate resources to continue in business for the foreseeable 
future. For this reason, they have adopted the going concern basis in preparing these ﬁnancial statements.

fees are for the period from 1 January 2006 until he ceased to be a director. 
G R Norfolk’s remuneration is paid to a company of which he is a director and shareholder, Acorn Corporate Finance Limited.
Share Options
Details of directors’ interests in share options can be found in the directors’ report on page 10.
Incentive schemes
Bonuses
Each executive director will earn proﬁt-related bonuses based on EBITDA (Earnings Before Interest, Tax, Depreciation and Amortisation) 
and achieving other performance criteria.
Enterprise Management Incentive (“EMI”) Scheme
The company has granted options under the EMI scheme to selected key employees. The eligible employees or directors must be an employee 
of the group, and not have a material interest in the company or the group. The individual participation limits held by an employee will be £100,000. 
The exercise price per ordinary share payable will be the higher of the market value of the shares at the date of grant agreed by the Inland Revenue 
and the nominal value of the share. An option will not normally be exercisable until three years have lapsed since its grant and subsisting options 
will lapse ten years after the grant. As at 31 January 2007, options over 2,197,095 ordinary shares granted under the EMI scheme remained unexercised.
Service contracts
Each of the executive directors has entered into a service agreement with the company. The service agreements are terminable on not less than 
six months’ notice by either party to the others at any time, save in respect of the agreement with P Carvell and T Houstoun, which is terminable 
on not less than 12 months’ notice. The service agreements contain provisions for early termination, inter alia, in the event of a breach by the 
director in question. 
Each of the non-executive directors has entered into a service agreement with the company. The service agreements are terminable on not less 
than three months’ notice by either party to the others or where the director is not re-elected at an annual general meeting. The service agreements 
contain provisions for early termination, inter alia, in the event of a breach by the director in question.
Report of the remuneration committee
_BUS_ar06_back.indd   6 06/06/2007   16:13:28 16 Business Direct Group plc Annual report and ﬁnancial statements 06/07
The directors are responsible for preparing the annual report and the ﬁnancial statements in accordance with applicable law and United Kingdom 
Generally Accepted Accounting Practice. Company law requires the directors to prepare ﬁnancial statements for each ﬁnancial year which give 
a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the company and of the group and of the proﬁt or loss of the group for that period. In preparing those 
ﬁnancial statements, the directors are required to:
• select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently;
• make judgements and estimates that are reasonable and prudent;
•  state whether applicable accounting standards have been followed, subject to any material departures disclosed and explained in the 
ﬁnancial statements; and
• prepare the ﬁnancial statements on the going concern basis unless it is inappropriate to presume that the group will continue in business.
The directors are responsible for keeping proper accounting records which disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the ﬁnancial position 
of the group and to enable them to ensure that the ﬁnancial statements comply with the requirements of the Companies Act 1985. They are 
also responsible for safeguarding the assets of the group and hence for taking reasonable steps for the prevention and detection of fraud 
and other irregularities.
The directors are responsible for ensuring that the directors’ report and other information included in the annual report is prepared in accordance 
with company law in the United Kingdom. They are also responsible for ensuring that the annual report includes information required by the 
AIM Rules.
The directors are also responsible for the maintenance and integrity of the Business Direct website. The work carried out by the auditors does 
not involve consideration of these matters and, accordingly, the auditors accept no responsibility for any changes that may have occurred to 
the information contained in the ﬁnancial statements since they were initially presented on the website.
Legislation in the United Kingdom governing the preparation and dissemination of the ﬁnancial statements and other information included 
in annual reports may differ from legislation in other jurisdictions.
Directors’ responsibilities

_BUS_ar06_back.indd   7 06/06/2007   16:13:28 17 Business Direct Group plc Annual report and ﬁnancial statements 06/07
We have audited the ﬁnancial statements which comprise the group proﬁt and loss account, the group balance sheet, the company balance sheet, 
the group cash ﬂow statement and the related notes. 
This report is made solely to the company’s members, as a body, in accordance with section 235 of the Companies Act 1985. Our audit work 
has been undertaken so that we might state to the company’s members those matters we are required to state to them in an auditors’ report 
and for no other purpose. To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility to anyone other than the company 
and the company’s members as a body, for our audit work, for this report, or for the opinions we have formed.
Respective responsibilities of directors and auditors
The directors’ responsibilities for preparing the Annual Report and the ﬁnancial statements in accordance with applicable law and United Kingdom 
Accounting Standards (United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice) are set out in the statement of directors’ responsibilities.
Our responsibility is to audit the ﬁnancial statements in accordance with relevant legal and regulatory requirements and International Standards 
on Auditing (UK and Ireland).
We report to you our opinion as to whether the ﬁnancial statements give a true and fair view and are properly prepared in accordance with the 
Companies Act 1985 and whether the information given in the directors’ report is consistent with the ﬁnancial statements. We also report to you if, 
in our opinion, the company has not kept proper accounting records, if we have not received all the information and explanations we require for 
our audit, or if information speciﬁed by law regarding directors’ remuneration and other transactions is not disclosed.
We read other information contained in the Annual Report, and consider whether it is consistent with the audited ﬁnancial statements. This other 
information comprises only the chairman’s review, the chief executive’s review, the report of the remuneration committee and the corporate 
governance statement. We consider the implications for our report if we become aware of any apparent misstatements or material inconsistencies 
with the ﬁnancial statements. Our responsibilities do not extend to any other information.
Basis of audit opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland) issued by the Auditing Practices Board. 
An audit includes examination, on a test basis, of evidence relevant to the amounts and disclosures in the ﬁnancial statements. It also includes 
an assessment of the signiﬁcant estimates and judgements made by the directors in the preparation of the ﬁnancial statements, and of whether 
the accounting policies are appropriate to the group’s and company’s circumstances, consistently applied and adequately disclosed.
We planned and performed our audit so as to obtain all the information and explanations which we considered necessary in order to provide 
us with sufﬁcient evidence to give reasonable assurance that the ﬁnancial statements are free from material misstatement, whether caused 
by fraud or other irregularity or error. In forming our opinion, we also evaluated the overall adequacy of the presentation of information in the 
ﬁnancial statements.
Opinion
In our opinion 
  the ﬁnancial statements give a true and fair view, in accordance with United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice, of the state 
of the group’s and parent company’s affairs as at 31 January 2007 and of the group’s loss for the period then ended and have been properly 
prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 1985; and
  the information given in the directors’ report is consistent with the ﬁnancial statements.

Basis of accounting
The ﬁnancial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention.
Change in accounting policies
The group has consistently applied all relevant accounting standards except for the changes in accounting standards as detailed below.
FRS 20 “Share-based Payment” is effective for unlisted companies (including AIM companies) for accounting periods beginning on or after 
1 January 2006. In accordance with the standard, the cost of share options awarded to employees and franchises measured by reference 
to their fair value at the date of grant is recognized over the vesting period of the options based on the number of options which in the opinion 
of the directors will ultimately vest. 
An analysis of the impact of FRS 20 is as follows:
Proﬁt and loss account
      Period to 
      31 January 
      2007 
      £
Loss before adoption of new accounting standards      (2,335,067)
Impact of FRS 20      (67,845)
Restated loss after adoption of new accounting standards      (2,402,912)
The directors have not made a prior year adjustment in respect of the cost of share options arising in prior years in view of the immateriality 
of the charge of £19,541 to these ﬁnancial statements.
Going concern
The group has incurred losses of £2,402,912 for the period (2005: £2,983,962). The directors have prepared ﬁnancial projections covering the 
three years ending 31 January 2010 which indicate that the group will continue to operate within the facilities arranged with its bankers. On this 
basis, the directors have adopted the going concern basis in the preparation of these ﬁnancial statements.
Basis of consolidation
The consolidated ﬁnancial statements incorporate the ﬁnancial statements of the company and all group undertakings. These are adjusted, 
where appropriate, to conform to group accounting policies. 
Acquisitions prior to 31 December 2004 are accounted for under the reverse acquisition method as set out in International Financial Reporting 
Standard 3 – Business Combinations and Mergers (“IFRS 3”) in relation to the acquisition of Business Direct Limited in 2004. This treatment does 
not comply with Companies Act 1985 or with Financial Reporting Standard 6 – “Acquisitions and Mergers”, which require merger accounting 
to be adopted. However, the directors are of the view that the reverse acquisition method should be adopted to give a true and fair view of 
the group restructuring. The ﬁnancial effect of this departure is not considered to be material to the group balance sheet. 
Acquisitions since 1 January 2005 are accounted for under the acquisition method. The results of companies acquired or disposed of are 
included in the proﬁt and loss account after or up to the date that control passes respectively. 
As a consolidated proﬁt and loss account is published, a separate proﬁt and loss account for the parent company is omitted from the group 
ﬁnancial statements by virtue of section 230 of the Companies Act 1985.
Turnover
The turnover shown in the proﬁt and loss account represents amounts invoiced for services provided during the period, exclusive of Value Added T ax.
Research and development expenditure
Development expenditure is carried forward when its future recoverability can be foreseen with reasonable assurance, and is amortised in line 
with the revenues deriving from the related assets. All other research and development expenditure is written off against proﬁts as incurred.
Retirement beneﬁts
For deﬁned contribution schemes, the amount charged to the proﬁt and loss account in respect of pension costs and other post-retirement 
beneﬁts is the contributions payable in the year. Differences between contributions payable in the year and contributions actually paid are shown 
as either accruals or prepayments in the balance sheet.
Accounting policies
_BUS_ar06_back.indd   13 06/06/2007   16:13:30 23 Business Direct Group plc Annual report and ﬁnancial statements 06/07
Share-based compensation
The group operates an equity-settled, share-based compensation plan. The fair value of the employee services received in exchange for the grant 
of options is recognised as an expense. The total amount to be expensed over the vesting period is determined by reference to the fair value 
of the options granted, excluding the impact of any non-market vesting conditions (for example, proﬁtability and growth targets). Non-market 
vesting conditions are included in the assumptions about the number of options that are expected to become exercisable. At each balance sheet 
date, the group revises its estimates of the number of options that are expected to become exercisable. It recognises the impact of the revision 
of original estimates, if any, in the proﬁt and loss account, and a corresponding adjustment to reserves over the remaining vesting period.
The proceeds received net of any attributable transaction costs are credited to share capital (nominal value) and share premium when the options 
are exercised.
Goodwill
Goodwill, representing the excess of the purchase price compared with the fair value of net assets acquired, is capitalised and written off evenly 
over 20 years as, in the opinion of the directors, this represents the period over which the goodwill is effective. It is reviewed for impairment at 
the end of the ﬁrst full ﬁnancial year following the acquisition and in other periods if events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying 
value may not be recoverable. 
Fixed assets
All ﬁxed assets are initially recorded at cost.
Depreciation
Depreciation is calculated so as to write off the cost of an asset, less its estimated residual value, over the useful economic life of that asset, 
as follows:
Leasehold Property – equally over the term of the lease 
Fixtures & Fittings – 25% on cost 
Computer Equipment – 25% on cost 
ParcelXchanges – 10% on cost
The carrying values of tangible ﬁxed assets are reviewed for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value 
may not be recoverable.
Operating lease agreements
Rentals applicable to operating leases where substantially all of the beneﬁts and risks of ownership remain with the lessor are charged against 
proﬁts on a straight-line basis over the period of the lease.
Deferred taxation
Deferred tax is recognised in respect of all timing differences that have originated but not reversed at the balance sheet date where transactions 
or events that result in an obligation to pay more tax in the future or a right to pay less tax in the future have occurred at the balance sheet date. 
Timing differences are differences between the group’s taxable proﬁts and its results as stated in the ﬁnancial statements that arise from the 
inclusion of gains and losses in tax assessments in periods different from those in which they are recognised in the ﬁnancial statements. 
Deferred tax assets are recognised only to the extent that the directors consider that it is more likely than not that there will be suitable taxable 
proﬁts from which the future reversal of the underlying tax differences can be deducted. 
Deferred tax is measured at the average tax rates that are expected to apply in the periods in which timing differences are expected to reverse, 
based on tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantially enacted by the balance sheet date. 
Deferred tax is measured on a non-discounted basis.
Deferred government grants
Government grants on capital expenditure are credited to deferred income and are released to the proﬁt and loss account by equal annual 
measurements over the expected useful life of the asset to which they relate.
Grants of a revenue nature are credited to the proﬁt and loss account in the period to which they relate.
Investments
These are valued at cost less a provision for any permanent impairment in value. When any transfer of business is made between subsidiaries, 
the cost of investment in those subsidiaries is adjusted accordingly to reﬂect the transaction.

1 Turnover and segmental analysis
The group operates in the provision of one activity, supplying logistic solutions to corporate entities. Revenues generated are wholly within the UK. 
Revenues generated through ParcelXchanges in the year grew by 163% to £4,477,000 (2005 £1,704,000). Further analysis of sales, net assets 
and results has not been given as, in the opinion of the directors, such disclosure would be prejudicial to the interests of the group.

loan is secured by a ﬁxed and ﬂoating charge on the assets of the company.
The directors’ and other loan are non-interest bearing, unsecured and not due for repayment within one year. The director owed money 
is T Houstoun (£93,597) and the other loan relates to C Wylde (£98,823) who resigned as a director in January 2006.

24 Financial instruments
As permitted by FRS 13, short term creditors and debtors have been excluded from the disclosures, with the exception of the currency proﬁle.
The group’s policy during the period ended 31 January 2007 to achieve its ﬁnancial and operational objectives was to use cash, short term deposits, 
convertible preference shares, long-term loans, asset based ﬁnance and invoice discounting. It is not the group’s policy to enter into ﬁnancial 
derivatives for speculative or trading purposes.
The group did not use ﬁnancial instruments during the year to hedge against interest rate movements; the group’s borrowings are linked to LIBOR. 
The interest rate proﬁle of ﬁnancial assets of the group as at 31 January 2007 is as follows:

    2,813,700  4,249,943
There have been no signiﬁcant changes in the role of ﬁnancial instruments since 31 January 2007.
Currency exposures
The group has no overseas assets or liabilities.
Borrowing facility
The group had no committed undrawn loan facilities at 31 January 2007 and had available £1,335,660 on the invoice discounting facility. 
Fair values of ﬁnancial assets and ﬁnancial liabilities 
The fair value, based upon the market value or discounted cashﬂows of the ﬁnancial instruments detailed above, was not materially different 
from their book values.

25 Earnings per share
Earnings per share are calculated in accordance with Financial Reporting Standard 22 (FRS 22). The calculation of basic loss per ordinary 
share is based on losses of £2,402,912 (2005 £2,983,962) and on 35,775,917 ordinary shares of 1p (2005 31,372,653), being the weighted 
average number of shares in issue during the year.
The loss for the period and the weighted average number of ordinary shares for calculating the diluted loss per share for the period ended 
31 January 2007 are identical to those used for the basic loss per share. This is because the outstanding share options would have the effect 
of reducing the loss per ordinary share and would therefore not be dilutive under the terms of FRS 22.
